Full text: Total spending from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24 rose 3.8 percent, data released by Mastercard SpendingPulse showed.
Heading into the holiday shopping season this year, retailers said they expected consumers to be more discerning -- motivated by deals rather than a once-a-year gift splurge. To keep them spending, companies as varied as electronics stores and beauty brands said they would be pushing promotions.
The bargains seem to have worked.
Total spending for the holiday period, from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, rose 3.8 percent, according to data released on Thursday by Mastercard SpendingPulse, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment. That's above Mastercard SpendingPulse's estimate of 3.2 percent for this year and more than last year, when growth was 3.1 percent.
Online sales stood out, rising 6.7 percent compared with a gain of about 2.9 percent for in-store sales. The data is not adjusted for inflation.
Spending is a perennial measure of consumer health: Inflation, nervousness about the job market and even a contentious outcome to the presidential election each could have hampered sales. But after a year of restraining themselves, shoppers instead decided to take advantage of the discounts. The last five days of the holiday season accounted for 10 percent of all holiday spending, the Mastercard SpendingPulse data showed.
"The holiday season is coming in pretty healthy because that's the period of time that people have to concentrate their spending," said Michelle Meyer, chief economist at the Mastercard Economics Institute. "They know that promotions are heavy. They want to gift for others and for themselves. So the big question will be, what happens next?"
It's not unusual for people to expect deals during the holidays, but this year's sales may have marked a turning point for both consumers and retailers. After years of gleefully raising prices, retailers seemed to acknowledge that they needed to aggressively discount to lure inflation-weary shoppers. What remains to be seen is if the spending will continue without the discounts in place.
"As a consumer, you knew you were up against all of this inflation and pricing," said Duleep Rodrigo, the U.S. sector leader for the consumer and retail division at KPMG, whose clients include major retailers and food and beverage companies. "It's taken a while for retailers to reshape the value buying equation, especially to work through the pricing challenges, because once you knew you could not increase pricing anymore, now you had to go back to packaging and promotions."
The shift to online shopping may have helped push down prices as it raised competition across all retailers. But even in stores, the discounts probably helped.
Joan Solomon, a 32-year veteran at Macy's, said Black Friday had been the busiest day of the holiday shopping season at the Clarins counter in the beauty department where she works.
"We are still holding on, and we're still making our numbers because people are shopping," Ms. Solomon said during an interview last week. "They may not shop as much as they used to, but they're shopping."
Ashley Foster, an executive director of an I.T. company in Fullerton, Calif., said she felt good about the level of deals across the stores where she was shopping, which included chains like Abercrombie & Fitch and Nordstrom.
Ms. Foster, 40, said she felt items were significantly cheaper than last year.
"I would say I bought more for myself this year than previous years just due to how many deals were available," said Ms. Foster, who was primarily focused on buying gifts for her 17-year-old daughter.
Not all retailers will benefit from the spending. Department stores and apparel sold in stores had the most anemic growth of the categories that Mastercard SpendingPulse highlighted in its data released Thursday.
Ahead of the holiday shopping season, Target, Macy's and Kohl's all cut their forecasts for profitability.
For some chains, the holiday season wasn't enough to fend off disaster: Both Big Lots and Party City said this month that they were preparing to close all of their stores.
But certainly some will come out on top. Retailers like Walmart and T.J. Maxx entered the holiday season on strong footing, drawing shoppers into their stores with low prices and surprising finds.
At FedEx, Brie Carere, the carrier's chief customer officer, said that going into the season, she had expected that shoppers would be more "conservative" with their spending.
"It does not feel that way right now," she said in an interview this month. "It feels right now like everybody is shopping. It feels like, for lack of a better term, a very normal, healthy peak season."
Large parcels -- over 50 pounds -- are also showing up more in FedEx's network, a sign that consumers have purchased higher-ticket items and shopped online to do so.
"I think consumers are really understanding the convenience of e-commerce for very specific items," Ms. Carere said. "The percentage of large packages in our networks continues to grow, and it's quite surprising how fast that continues to grow."

How One of the World's Richest Men Avoids $8 Billion in Taxes: [National Desk]

Full text: Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, is the 10th-richest person in the United States, worth $ 127 billion. In theory, when he dies, his estate should pay 40 percent of his net worth to the government in taxes.
But Mr. Huang, 61, is not only an engineering genius and Silicon Valley icon whose company, the world's second-most valuable, makes the chips that power much artificial intelligence. He is also the beneficiary of a series of tax dodges that will enable him to pass on much of his fortune tax free, according to securities and tax filings reviewed by The New York Times.
The savings for his family are on a pace to be roughly $ 8 billion. It likely ranks among the largest tax dodges in the United States.
The types of strategies Mr. Huang has deployed to shield his wealth have become ubiquitous among the ultrawealthy. Blackstone Group's Stephen A. Schwarzman, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and top executives at Google, Coinbase, Eli Lilly, Mastercard and Advanced Micro Devices have collectively shifted billions of dollars into financial vehicles in order to avoid the federal estate tax, according to a Times analysis of securities disclosures.
It is just one sign of how the estate tax -- imposed solely on a sliver of the country's multimillionaires -- has been eviscerated.
Revenue from the tax has barely changed since 2000, even as the wealth of the richest Americans has roughly quadrupled. If the estate tax had simply kept pace, it would have raised around $ 120 billion last year. Instead it brought in about a quarter of that.
That missing revenue would be enough to simultaneously double the budget of the Justice Department and triple federal funding for cancer and Alzheimer's research.
The story of Mr. Huang's tax avoidance is a case study in how the ultrarich bend the U.S. tax system for their benefit. His strategies were not explicitly authorized by Congress. Instead, they were cooked up by creative lawyers who have exploited a combination of obscure federal regulations, narrow findings by courts and rulings that the Internal Revenue Service issues in individual cases that then served as models for future tax shelters. As such strategies became widespread, they effectively became the law.
"You have an army of well-trained, brilliant people who sit there all day long, charging $ 1,000 an hour, thinking up ways to beat this tax," said Jack Bogdanski, a professor at Lewis & Clark Law School and the author of a widely cited treatise on the estate tax. "Don't expect anyone in Congress to stop this."
The richest Americans are able to pass down approximately $ 200 billion each year without paying estate tax on it, thanks to the use of complex trusts and other avoidance strategies, estimated Daniel Hemel, a tax law professor at New York University.
Enforcement of the rules governing the estate tax has eased in part because the I.R.S. has been decimated by years of budget cuts. In the early 1990s, the agency audited more than 20 percent of all estate tax returns. By 2020, the rate had fallen to about 3 percent.
The trend is likely to accelerate with Republicans controlling both the White House and Capitol Hill. They are already slashing funding for law enforcement by the I.R.S. The incoming Senate majority leader, John Thune, and other congressional Republicans for years have been trying to kill the estate tax, branding it as a penalty on family farms and small businesses.
Yet Mr. Huang's multibillion-dollar maneuver -- detailed in the fine print of his filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and his foundation's disclosures to the I.R.S. -- shows the extent to which the estate tax has already been hollowed out.
"From an estate-tax-planning perspective, it's a grand slam," said Jonathan Blattmachr, a prominent trusts and estates lawyer who reviewed Mr. Huang's disclosures for The Times. "He's done a magnificent job."
An Nvidia spokeswoman, Stephanie Matthew, declined to discuss details of the Huangs' tax strategies.
'Only Morons'
Going back millenniums, governments have sought to slow the buildup of dynastic wealth. Augustus Caesar in ancient Rome taxed wealth at death. Adam Smith, the intellectual father of laissez-faire capitalism, attacked inherited fortunes. During the last Gilded Age, so did some of America's wealthiest men. "By taxing estates heavily at death, the state marks its condemnation of the selfish millionaire's unworthy life," Andrew Carnegie said.
The United States adopted the modern estate tax in 1916. In recent decades, congressional Republicans have successfully watered it down, cutting the rate and increasing the amount that is exempt from the tax. Today, a married couple can pass on about $ 27 million tax free; anything more than that is generally supposed to be taxed at a 40 percent rate.
Billionaires have made a sport out of trying to avoid the tax. Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive who was President-elect Donald J. Trump's chief economic adviser during his first administration, once quipped that "only morons pay the estate tax."
Mr. Huang is no moron. In 1993, he and two other engineers were eating in a booth at a Denny's in San Jose, Calif., when they came up with the idea for a powerful new computer chip that would be the basis for Nvidia. The company was initially focused on making chips for 3-D graphics, but by the 2000s it was branching into other areas, such as supplying semiconductors for Tesla's electric vehicles.
In 2012, Mr. Huang and his wife, Lori, took one of their first steps to shield their fortune from the estate tax.
They set up a financial vehicle known as an irrevocable trust and moved 584,000 Nvidia shares into it, according to a securities disclosure that Mr. Huang filed. The shares at the time were worth about $ 7 million, but they would eventually generate tax savings many times greater.
The Huangs were taking advantage of a precedent set nearly two decades earlier, in 1995, when the I.R.S. blessed a transaction that tax professionals affectionately nicknamed "I Dig It." (The moniker was a play on the name of the type of financial vehicle involved: an intentionally defective grantor trust.)
One of the beauties of I Dig It was that it had the potential to largely circumvent not only the estate tax but also the federal gift tax. That tax applies to assets that multimillionaires give to their heirs while they're alive and essentially serves as a backstop to the estate tax; otherwise, rich people could give away all their money before they die in order to avoid the estate tax.
Here's how the I Dig It arrangement worked. Say that a hypothetical tycoon, John Doe, gave $ 10 million in cash to a trust for the benefit of his children. He wouldn't have to pay gift taxes on that unless he had already hit the $ 27 million gift-tax exemption.
The trust could then use a combination of the $ 10 million and a loan from Mr. Doe to acquire $ 100 million of shares. Those shares wouldn't be subject to the estate tax, thanks to the I.R.S.'s 1995 ruling.
There was an additional benefit. Say that the value of the shares in the trust soared tenfold. None of that would be subject to the estate tax. But it could trigger a $ 214 million capital gains tax bill -- the $ 900 million gain taxed at 23.8 percent. Under a separate I.R.S. ruling, Mr. Doe could pay that tax on the trust's behalf, without it counting as an additional gift to his heirs.
Otherwise, the trust would have to pay the capital gains tax bill, leaving a smaller fortune to future generations.
The I Dig It maneuver was enormously complicated -- and enormously lucrative.
"I've always called it the gift that keeps on giving," said Michael D. Mulligan, a veteran trusts and estates lawyer in St. Louis who helped create the strategy.
A parade of the ultrawealthy soon deployed variations of the technique, according to filings in court and with securities regulators.
The family of the media mogul Mel Karmazin used several I Dig Its. A former owner of the Detroit Pistons, Bill Davidson, used them to avoid more than $ 2.7 billion in taxes. Mitt Romney, who at the time was running the private equity firm Bain Capital and would later propose abolishing the estate tax as the Republican nominee for president in 2012, also used the technique.
The I.R.S. has challenged some setups that it viewed as overly aggressive. Mr. Davidson settled with the I.R.S. The agency claimed that the Karmazin family's arrangements "lacked economic substance" and sought $ 2.4 million in back taxes. But the agency ultimately abandoned most of its arguments and collected about $ 100,000, according to a lawyer for the Karmazin family.
In Mr. Huang's case, the details in securities filings are limited. But multiple experts, including Mr. Mulligan, said it was almost certainly a classic I Dig It gift, loan and sale transaction.
The $ 7 million of shares that Mr. Huang moved into his trust in 2012 are today worth more than $ 3 billion. If those shares were directly passed on to Mr. Huang's heirs, they would be taxed at 40 percent -- or well over $ 1 billion.
Instead, the tax bill will probably be no more than a few hundred thousand dollars.
First-Name Basis
The Huangs soon took another big step toward reducing their estate-tax bill.
Nvidia was emerging as the main provider of chips for artificial intelligence technology, eventually capturing more than 90 percent of the market. Mr. Huang was becoming a Silicon Valley celebrity. He adopted an all-black dress code. Such was his renown that he was known in tech circles simply by his first name, along with luminaries like Tesla's Elon, Meta's Mark and Google's Sergey and Larry.
In 2016, the Huangs set up several vehicles known as grantor retained annuity trusts, or GRATs, securities filings show.
They were borrowing a strategy that had been invented years earlier on behalf of the ex-wife of Walmart's co-founder. Beginning in 1993, Audrey Walton transferred about $ 200 million worth of shares to two GRATs. The twist was that the trusts had to eventually repay Ms. Walton the value of those shares, plus some modest interest. If the value of the shares went up more than what had to be repaid, the trusts could keep whatever was left over -- tax free.
The I.R.S. contested the arrangement on narrow technical grounds. But in 2000, a U.S. Tax Court judge upheld its legality.
Mr. Hemel of New York University said the I.R.S. could have challenged the use of GRATs on other grounds as well. Instead, he said, the agency "capitulated" and essentially permitted the use of the trusts as an acceptable avenue for avoiding the estate tax.
Billionaires took notice. The Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, the oil investor Harold Hamm, the cable magnates John Malone and Charles Dolan, and the designer Ralph Lauren were among those who set up GRATs soon after the Walton decision, according to disclosures in the men's filings with the S.E.C. That positioned their families to collectively avoid billions of dollars in future tax bills.
Under President Barack Obama, the Treasury Department repeatedly tried to make it harder to avoid the estate tax, proposing restrictions on the use of GRATs and I Dig Its. But the proposals died in Congress. (In the Trump administration, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, himself a GRAT user, would halt efforts to close the loopholes.)
In 2016, Mr. Huang and his wife put just over three million Nvidia shares into their four new GRATs. The shares were worth about $ 100 million. If their value rose, the increase would be a tax-free windfall for their two adult children, who both work at Nvidia.
That is precisely what happened. The shares are now worth more than $ 15 billion, according to data from securities filings compiled for The Times by Equilar, a data firm. That means that the Huang family is poised to avoid roughly $ 6 billion in estate taxes.
If the Huangs' trusts sell their shares, that will generate a hefty capital gains tax bill -- more than $ 4 billion, based on Nvidia's current stock price. Mr. and Mrs. Huang can pay that bill on behalf of the trusts, without it counting as a taxable gift to their heirs.
A Charitable Tax Dodge
Starting in 2007, Mr. Huang deployed another technique that will further reduce his family's estate taxes. This strategy involved taking advantage of his and his wife's charitable foundation.
Mr. Huang has given the Jen Hsun & Lori Huang Foundation shares of Nvidia that were worth about $ 330 million at the time of the donations. Such donations are tax-deductible, meaning they reduced the Huangs' income tax bills in the years that the gifts took place.
Foundations are required to make annual donations to charities equal to at least 5 percent of their total assets. But the Huangs' foundation, like those of many billionaires, is satisfying that requirement by giving heavily to what is known as a donor-advised fund.
Such funds are pools of money that the donor controls. There are limitations on how the money can be spent. Buying cars or vacation homes or the like is off limits. But a fund could, say, invest money in a business run by the donor's friend or donate enough money to name a building at a university that the donor's children hope to attend.
There is a gaping loophole in the tax laws: Donor-advised funds are not required to actually give any money to charitable organizations.
When the donor dies, control of the fund can pass to his heirs -- without incurring any estate taxes.
In recent years, 84 percent of the Huang foundation's donations have gone to their donor-advised fund, named GeForce, an apparent nod to the name of an Nvidia videogame chip. The Nvidia shares that the Huangs have donated are today worth about $ 2 billion.
The fund is not required to disclose how its money is spent, though the foundation has said the assets will be used for charitable purposes. The Nvidia spokeswoman, Ms. Matthew, said those causes included higher education and public health.
But there is another benefit. Based on Nvidia's current stock price, the donations to the fund have reduced Mr. Huang's eventual estate-tax bill by about $ 800 million.

If the value of the shares went up more than what had to be repaid, the trusts could keep whatever was left over — tax free.
The IRS contested the arrangement on narrow technical grounds. But in 2000, a U.S. Tax Court judge upheld its legality.
Hemel of New York University said the IRS could have challenged the use of GRATs on other grounds as well. Instead, he said, the agency “capitulated” and essentially permitted the use of the trusts as an acceptable avenue for avoiding the estate tax.
Billionaires took notice. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, oil investor Harold Hamm, cable magnates John Malone and Charles Dolan, and designer Ralph Lauren were among those who set up GRATs soon after the Walton decision, according to disclosures in the men’s filings with the SEC. That positioned their families to collectively avoid billions of dollars in future tax bills.
Under President Barack Obama, the Treasury Department repeatedly tried to make it harder to avoid the estate tax, proposing restrictions on the use of GRATs and I Dig Its. But the proposals died in Congress. (In the Trump administration, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, himself a GRAT user, would halt efforts to close the loopholes.)
In 2016, Huang and his wife put just over 3 million Nvidia shares into their four new GRATs. The shares were worth about $100 million. If their value rose, the increase would be a tax-free windfall for their two adult children, who both work at Nvidia.
That is precisely what happened. The shares are now worth more than $15 billion, according to data from securities filings compiled for the Times by Equilar, a data firm. That means the Huang family is poised to avoid roughly $6 billion in estate taxes.
If the Huangs’ trusts sell their shares, that will generate a hefty capital gains tax bill — more than $4 billion, based on Nvidia’s current stock price. The Huangs can pay that bill on behalf of the trusts, without it counting as a taxable gift to their heirs.
A Charitable Tax Dodge
Starting in 2007, Huang deployed another technique that will further reduce his family’s estate taxes. This strategy involved taking advantage of his and his wife’s charitable foundation.
Huang has given the Jen Hsun & Lori Huang Foundation shares of Nvidia worth about $330 million at the time of the donations. Such donations are tax-deductible, meaning they reduced the Huangs’ income tax bills in the years that the gifts took place.
Foundations are required to make annual donations to charities equal to at least 5% of their total assets. But the Huangs’ foundation, like those of many billionaires, is satisfying that requirement by giving heavily to what is known as a donor-advised fund.
Such funds are pools of money that the donor controls. There are limitations on how the money can be spent. Buying cars or vacation homes or the like is off limits. But a fund could, say, invest money in a business run by the donor’s friend or donate enough money to name a building at a university that the donor’s children hope to attend.
There is a gaping loophole in the tax laws: Donor-advised funds are not required to actually give any money to charitable organizations.
When the donor dies, control of the fund can pass to his heirs — without incurring any estate taxes.
In recent years, 84% of the Huang foundation’s donations have gone to their donor-advised fund, named GeForce, an apparent nod to the name of an Nvidia video game chip. The Nvidia shares the Huangs have donated are today worth about $2 billion.
The fund is not required to disclose how its money is spent, though the foundation has said the assets will be used for charitable purposes. Matthew, the Nvidia spokesperson, said those causes included higher education and public health.
But there is another benefit. Based on Nvidia’s current stock price, the donations to the fund have reduced Huang’s eventual estate-tax bill by about $800 million.

Bitcoin Hits a Milestone: $100,000

In May 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, an early cryptocurrency enthusiast, used bitcoin to buy two pizzas from Papa John’s. He spent 10,000 bitcoins, or roughly $40 at the time, in one of the first purchases ever made with the digital currency.
It has turned out to be the most expensive dinner in history.
On Wednesday, the price of a single bitcoin rose to more than $100,000, a remarkable milestone for an experimental financial asset that had once been mocked as a sideshow and a fad. The total cost of those pizzas today: $1 billion.
Bitcoin now stands as arguably the most successful investment product of the past 20 years. The value of all the coins in circulation is $2 trillion, more than the combined worth of Mastercard, Walmart and JPMorgan Chase. The motley assortment of hackers and political radicals who embraced bitcoin when it was created by an anonymous coder in 2008 have become millionaires many times over. And the invention has spawned an entire industry anchored by publicly traded companies such as Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, and promoted by celebrities, athletes and Elon Musk.
Even the president-elect says he is a believer. During the campaign, Donald Trump marketed himself as a bitcoin enthusiast, vowing to create a federal stockpile that could push its price even higher.
Bitcoin began as “essentially an experimental hobbyist project,” said Finn Brunton, author of a 2019 book about the history of cryptocurrency. “To see where it is now is to see a really impressive feat.”
bitcoin’s rise to $100,000 signals its now-undeniable status in the global economic system. The virtual currency has become a staple of financial markets, embraced by Wall Street giants and amateur investors alike. Its surge also caps an astonishing turnaround after its price dropped below $17,000 in 2022, as the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange sent the industry into a tailspin.
This year, bitcoin has come roaring back. Federal regulators allowed Wall Street firms to offer a popular financial product tied to the coin, attracting billions of dollars in fresh investment. Then, Trump’s election victory sent its price even higher, as crypto enthusiasts branded him the first “bitcoin president.”
In a matter of months, bitcoin investors went from bemoaning tough regulation under the Biden administration to shopping for Lamborghinis and gloating on social media. Top crypto executives spent about $135 million to influence the U.S. election, and they are now enjoying the spoils.
Last month, Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission and a crypto critic who had led a crackdown on the industry, said he would step down Jan. 20.
A few hours before bitcoin hit its milestone, Trump picked Paul Atkins, a former regulator and founder of a financial consulting firm, as the next SEC leader. Atkins has advised a crypto industry group and is viewed as an advocate for digital assets.
“There’s an enormous amount of excitement in the industry right now,” said Jeremy Allaire, the CEO of Circle, an influential U.S. crypto company. “A lot of positive energy.”
Still, bitcoin remains prone to extreme volatility. Its price sometimes drops when the global economy struggles. Environmental groups have raised concerns that the energy required to run bitcoin’s software contributes to climate change, and the technology has long been used by scammers and thieves.
While some of that illicit activity has fallen off, cybercriminals used digital currencies to facilitate about $500 million in ransom payments over the first six months of the year, according to crypto forensics firm Chainalysis.
Before it became a cultural and financial phenomenon, bitcoin was just an idea sketched out in a nine-page white paper posted on an internet mailing list on Halloween in 2008. The author was a mysterious coder who used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. At its most basic, Satoshi’s vision was a type of digital money that people could exchange without relying on banks to process the transfers. Every transaction would be recorded on a publicly visible ledger known as a blockchain.
Early enthusiasts envisioned bitcoin as the foundation for a new kind of financial system that would be governed by code and exist outside the supervision of Wall Street firms and government regulators. They also viewed bitcoin as a long-term store of value — it was programmed to have a fixed supply, so it would be resistant to inflation.
The Wall Street establishment dismissed bitcoin as a passing trend and a tool for criminals. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, called bitcoin “a fraud” and a “Ponzi scheme.” Trump once decried it as “a scam” devised to undermine the U.S. dollar.
But believers thought bitcoin might someday facilitate real-world transactions. On May 18, 2010, Hanyecz posted in a popular bitcoin forum, offering to send 10,000 bitcoins to anyone who ordered him pizza from Papa John’s. “Like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day,” he wrote.
A deal was struck, and the event became known as Bitcoin Pizza Day. Over the next decade, bitcoin inspired thousands of other digital currencies with names like Ether, Solana and Dogecoin, some of which also became enormously valuable.
In November 2021, bitcoin’s price soared to nearly $70,000, setting a record. The crypto world was ascendant. Kim Kardashian encouraged her Instagram followers to buy the coins, and athletes like Tom Brady and Steph Curry promoted crypto companies in splashy television commercials.
Then the bubble burst. In 2022, FTX and other prominent crypto firms filed for bankruptcy, causing the prices of bitcoin and other digital assets to plummet by as much as 96%. Amateur investors who had poured money into crypto saw their savings vanish. In Washington, Gensler of the SEC embarked on a wide-ranging clampdown.
But the industry’s fortunes changed again this year, after the SEC lost a court battle to block a new financial product tied to bitcoin. In January, major Wall Street firms, including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Fidelity, started offering exchange-traded funds linked to bitcoin, attracting a wave of investment. Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed to another record in March.
Wealthy investors who had held onto their bitcoin became even richer. Michael Saylor, CEO of software firm MicroStrategy, had been widely mocked for borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars to buy bitcoin for his company. Now his stash is worth more than $30 billion.
On the campaign trail, Trump proclaimed himself a bitcoin enthusiast, promising to fire Gensler and end the SEC’s crackdown. A few weeks before the election, Trump and his sons started their own crypto business, World Liberty Financial, putting the family in a position to benefit personally from softer regulations.
Suddenly, a financial asset designed to circumvent the U.S. government was surging in value because a U.S. presidential candidate had embraced it.
Bitcoin has risen in “exactly the opposite way that it was intended,” said Brunton, the crypto author. “By being something where its real value comes from its association with a politician and a state actor.”

Full text: The price of a single Bitcoin rose to six figures for the first time, an extraordinary level for a 16-year-old cryptocurrency once dismissed as a sideshow.

Amtrak Reports Reaching Record Ridership in 2024
Amtrak said on Tuesday that ridership topped 2019 pre-Covid levels for the first time in 2024 and reached a record high even with less capacity.
Ridership increased 15 percent over 2023 to a record 32.8 million customer trips, as passenger revenue hit $ 2.5 billion, up 9 percent over the prior year, while total operating revenue was $ 3.6 billion, up 7 percent. Amtrak reported an adjusted operating loss of $ 705 million for the 12 months ending Sept. 30, down 9 percent.
Amtrak's prior record was 32.3 million passengers in 2019, which was up 45 percent from 2003.
Amtrak in March said it was boosting passenger services on the East Coast as it aims to double ridership nationwide by 2040 to 66 million passengers and faces issues to expand service.
Congress approved $ 66 billion in funding for rail projects as part of a massive infrastructure bill in 2021, with $ 22 billion dedicated to Amtrak. REUTERS
LABOR
Cargill Lays Off 5 Percent Of Its Global Work Force
Agribusiness giant Cargill is laying off thousands of its employees.
Cargill confirmed this week that it would be reducing its global work force by about 5 percent. In a statement sent to The Associated Press on Tuesday, the food production company said that the cuts were part of a long-term strategy "to strengthen Cargill's impact," which includes realigning resources.
Minnesota-based Cargill did not immediately provide further specifics around the layoffs. But a 2024 annual report from the company noted that it had more than 160,000 employees worldwide, meaning the latest job cuts would be set to impact 8,000 workers.
As a privately-held company, Cargill doesn't regularly publish its finances publicly. A 2024 report from the company, however, notes that it operates in 70 countries and sells to 125 markets with some $ 160 billion in annual revenue. ASSOCIATED PRESS
LITIGATION
'Agreement in Principle' To Settle Mastercard Suit
Mastercard has reached an agreement in principle to settle a collective London lawsuit brought on behalf of British consumers over card fees, it said on Tuesday.
The global payments processor was facing a lawsuit brought by consumer champion Walter Merricks on behalf of about 46 million adults in the United Kingdom.
The case became the first mass consumer action to be approved in the U.K. in 2021 after a nearly five-year journey from the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) to the U.K. Supreme Court and back.
Mastercard said that, during the latest round of the case on Tuesday, it was announced the company and Merricks -- the claimant class representative -- had reached an agreement, subject to the tribunal's approval.
Claimants' lawyers said the entire claim was about 10 billion pounds ( $ 12.7 billion). A person familiar with the agreement, however, said the figure was around 200 million pounds. REUTERS

More Shopping Than Expected Over Holiday: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: An estimated 197 million people shopped from Black Friday to Cyber Monday, the National Retail Federation said, fewer than last year but surpassing the group's expectations.
Slightly fewer people shopped during this year's Thanksgiving weekend compared with 2023, when a record 200 million people shelled out for the holidays, according to a survey released on Tuesday by the National Retail Federation.
The data showed that an estimated 197 million people shopped during the five-day period from Thanksgiving Day to Cyber Monday, still indicating relatively robust spending patterns to kick off the holiday season, which this year is poised to revolve around consumers' search for deals. Data released by Mastercard on Saturday showed that Americans were selective about what they bought and that they took advantage of discounts offered on Thanksgiving and Black Friday.
But shoppers also spent more this year: almost 15 percent more online on Black Friday than they did last year, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which measures retail sales across all forms of payment. In-store sales were also up but more modestly, at 0.7 percent, for an overall increase of 3.4 percent.
As a whole, consumer spending, the engine of the U.S. economy, has remained relatively robust. Corporate executives, however, have recently painted a picture of Americans still feeling the squeeze of inflation, hinting at diverging fortunes for retailers as shoppers have become pickier about what they buy and where they buy it.
Almost the same number of people shopped online as those who opted to do their shopping at physical stores: About 126 million people visited physical stores over the holiday weekend, the National Retail Federation said, while roughly 124 million did their shopping online. Black Friday had the most traffic, both in stores and online.
Consumers spent an average of $ 235 on gifts for the holidays -- $ 8 more than in 2023 -- with almost half spent on clothing or accessories, the retail federation said.
"Even with this year's shortened shopping period and the multitude of early sales promotions from retailers, this past weekend exceeded expectations in terms of the sheer volume of shoppers," Matthew Shay, the president and chief executive of the federation, said in a statement. The group had predicted that roughly 183 million people would shop over the weekend.
In the survey, 38 percent of shoppers said they had taken advantage of sales during the week leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Retail executives have highlighted these cautious spending patterns in recent weeks: An executive at Target described consumers as shifting from "resilient" to "resourceful," and a leader at Walmart said shoppers "seek value to maximize their budgets."
On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Shay said the slight downturn in the number of shoppers over Thanksgiving weekend partly reflected the fact that the holiday fell later in the month. More shoppers jumped on retailers' early deals before the holiday weekend, he said.
The National Retail Federation projected U.S. holiday sales to grow as much as 3.5 percent overall this year, slower than in recent years but in line with averages before the coronavirus pandemic.

Full text: Credit and debit card fees were always a big business expense for Patti Riordan, who owns a hobby shop in Lancaster, Ohio. But, she said, since the coronavirus pandemic, they've become a pain point.
As a pandemic precaution, droves of customers gave up cash in favor of contactless payment methods like tap to pay, and the percentage of Ms. Riordan's sales processed through a card network rose to 75 percent, up from 65 percent in 2020. Now, so-called swipe fees are her third biggest expense, behind payroll and rent, amounting to roughly $ 18,000 a year.
"There is no room to pay more -- we're just operating so thin," Ms. Riordan said.
Debit and credit card fees are among the top monthly expenses for many small businesses, which say the costs are becoming more onerous as fewer consumers carry cash. Merchants of all sizes paid a total of $ 172 billion in processing fees in 2023, up from roughly $ 116 billion the year before the pandemic, according to the Nilson Report, which tracks the payments industry. That's a 48 percent increase.
When they swipe a credit card, businesses pay fees to the bank that issues the card, to the payment network and, often, to companies like Toast and Square that help process the transaction. The biggest share of those fees -- averaging more than 2 percent of a transaction amount -- is set by payment networks like Visa and Mastercard and paid to the issuing bank, ultimately benefiting both the banks and the networks.
Visa and Mastercard together control more than 80 percent of the market for card purchases. But, the two companies have argued, there is robust competition among payment networks. American Express -- which accounts for roughly 11 percent of card purchases, and Discover, roughly 2 percent -- are the two other leading payment networks, according to Nilson Report data.
Merchants can't negotiate their own fees, and they don't always understand why the fees change.
Cheetie Kumar, a two-time James Beard Award Foundation nominee and owner of the Eastern Mediterranean restaurant Ajja in Raleigh, N.C., uses Toast to process card payments. She said she's not able to see the rates Toast passes on from major networks like Visa and Mastercard. Instead, she sees the total cost of accepting cards, including Toast's fees, which together amount to about 4 percent of her revenue.
"There's just no flexibility in this," Ms. Kumar said. "It just kind of feels like we're up against this seemingly permanent expense and we're not really understanding why."
Visa and Mastercard have increased their fees for certain credit card transactions at least once since the pandemic, said Callum Godwin, chief economist at CMSPI, a payments consulting firm. Mastercard, however, said that it had only imposed a new service charge on financial institutions, and that the network does not control whether or how it is passed on to merchants.
An even bigger factor contributing to the uptick in merchants' fees, according to Mr. Godwin: The card companies have in the past couple of years shifted toward offering more premium rewards cards that have "substantially higher" fees for retailers. When a customer pays with a premium card, the retailer has to pay more to the bank that issued the card, he said.
Visa and Mastercard say that their fees allow for investments in security like fraud protections and that the speed and efficiency of their network give an incentive to businesses to accept cards. Bill Sheedy, a senior adviser to Visa's chief executive, also argued that average interchange fees, as a percentage of each transaction, have remained stable over the past decade, even as payment volume has skyrocketed. (Groups representing retailers dispute that assertion.)
Still, lawmakers and government agencies are taking some steps to rein the fees in.
The Justice Department in September filed an antitrust lawsuit against Visa, accusing the company of unfairly stifling competition in debit cards and charging unnecessarily high fees. Groups representing small business owners have cheered on that lawsuit. Many merchants, who don't see the move away from cash reversing anytime soon, are reluctant to pass the costs onto consumers, and are left hoping the government steps in.
Julie Rottenberg, Visa's general counsel, said that the government's allegations are "meritless" and that the lawsuit "ignores the reality that Visa is just one of many competitors in a debit space that is growing, with entrants who are thriving." On its website, Visa says it uses transaction fees "to balance and grow the payment system for the benefit of all participants."
While the Justice Department's complaint zeros in on debit fees, Doug Kantor, an executive committee member of the Merchants Payments Coalition, said the case also puts a spotlight on credit card transaction fees, which can be even more cumbersome for merchants.
Legislative efforts to rein in credit card swipe fees include a bipartisan bill introduced last year by Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, called the Credit Card Competition Act. It would require large banks that issue credit cards to enable at least two networks to process payments made with those cards -- an effort to increase competition between payment processors beyond Visa and Mastercard, which could lower fees.
Under the proposed law, a merchant would be able to choose to route a card purchase over Visa or Discover, for example, or over a smaller network like Shazam. Some of the biggest retailers, including Walmart and Kroger, have lobbied for the legislation.
CMSPI estimates that the legislation, if passed, could result in more than $ 16 billion in savings for merchants and consumers. Mr. Godwin said that while that was a lot of money, it was not nearly enough to "wipe Visa and Mastercard off the map."
The largest credit card processing networks and issuers argue that the bill would harm consumers by eroding fraud protections and chipping away at credit card rewards. At a Senate hearing on the legislation earlier this month, Mr. Sheedy of Visa testified that Visa "has no incentive to set interchange fees high or low," arguing that the act would "remove consumer control over their own payment decisions" and undermine security.
At the hearing, Linda Kirkpatrick, Mastercard's president for the Americas, argued that Mastercard, with less than half of Visa's credit card market share, does not have "the share nor the ability to exert market power."
"It's clear the value derived from electronic payments far outweighs the cost," Ms. Kirkpatrick testified.
In March, as part of a class-action settlement, Visa and Mastercard agreed to cap the so-called swipe fees they charge to merchants that accept their credit cards, though a judge rejected the settlement in June. Some merchants and trade groups say that the fee caps in the settlement did not go far enough and that Congress needs to pass legislation to promote a more competitive marketplace.
An amendment to sweeping financial legislation in 2010 imposed price controls on debit transactions, despite objections from the banking industry. It gave the Federal Reserve the authority to regulate and limit the fees businesses pay to card companies.
That amendment, however, "has not had that great of an effect" on fees, said Keith Barnett, a partner at Troutman Pepper who leads the law firm's payments practice. The Justice Department, in its antitrust lawsuit, said the amendment initially helped spread debit volume to networks other than Visa, but Visa then used its market dominance to limit competition, undermining the amendment's intended effects. For example, Visa scaled back JPMorgan Chase's ability to add Discover's Pulse network to its Visa-branded debit cards, granting only temporary Pulse access and requiring Chase to enter a routing agreement with Visa, according to the suit.
The stance of the incoming Trump administration on regulating payment systems remains unclear. Vice President-elect JD Vance initially cosponsored the Credit Card Competition Act last year but has not spoken out recently on the issue.
"This concern is not going to go away," said Susan Stephan, a professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Law who specializes in antitrust law. "Consumers are really concerned about rising costs in every arena, and this is one where there's actually the potential for legislation to make a difference."
Many small business are worried that without some relief, their businesses will be crippled.
Nicole Lintemuth said the roughly $ 600 she pays in transaction fees each month translates to less inventory on the shelves of her bookstore in Lowell, Mich., called Bettie's Pages. She said she has also had to cut back on staffing to ensure she has a cushion to make payroll.
Late July through August is typically a slow period for her business. This year, she said, she wasn't sure she'd be able to pay rent for September. Loyal customers shopped to boost sales and ultimately helped her stay afloat. But seeing a "huge portion" of the money she earned go to transaction fees was frustrating, she said, forcing her to consider raising prices.
In 2023, just over 3 percent of her total sales went to fees.
"Our margins are very thin," Ms. Lintemuth said. "That's the difference between a successful month and a not successful month."

Shoppers Seem Willing to Bite On Discounts Over Weekend: [National Desk]

Full text: Data on spending this week shows consumers are being drawn to discounts. Online Black Friday sales picked up at a faster pace this year than in-store shopping, Mastercard reported.
For weeks, businesses have been sending consumers endless offers of discounts on all sorts of items. On this long weekend, consumers finally bit.
Data released on Saturday showed that Americans took advantage of big deals on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, opening their wallets, though they were selective about what they bought.
Shoppers spent $ 10.8 billion online on Friday, according to data on Saturday from Adobe Analytics. That's on top of $ 6.1 billion spent online on Thursday, around 9 percent more than the previous year.
Another metric from Mastercard SpendingPulse, which measures retail sales across all forms of payment, found that online sales on Black Friday had increased by nearly 15 percent but that in-store sales had increased by only 0.7 percent, for an overall increase of 3.4 percent. It said that jewelry, electronics and apparel were the top purchases, with discounts playing a role in consumer decisions.
"I think it's the consumer being mindful about how they're using their dollar and purchasing power, knowing they have so many choices," said Michelle Meyer, chief economist at the Mastercard Economics Institute. She said that in-store spending had been strong going into the holiday weekend, but on Black Friday itself, it was "sluggish."
These numbers offer an early look at how the holiday shopping season has gone so far. The National Retail Federation is set to update its figures next week, and those numbers will give a fuller accounting.
Ahead of the holiday weekend, as retailers issued forecasts for the coming months, they painted a picture of shoppers who have grown choosy, holding off on large purchases after years of faster-than-usual price increases and with interest rates still high.
"Consumers have been waiting all of 2024 for this moment to buy the goods they want and need at a lower price, and they seem to be pleased with the discounts they're seeing this week," said Caila Schwartz, the director of consumer insights at Salesforce, which also tracks spending data.
According to real-time data from Shopify, a provider of software to retail businesses, the top product categories by volume among its clients on Friday included items like T-shirts, skin care and makeup products, while purchases of electronics were more muted.
Anjee Solanki, the national director of retail services and practice groups at Colliers U.S., a professional services and investment management company, said that toys, beauty items, small kitchen appliances and shoes were "winners," with discounts of 30 to 50 percent off the list price.
The National Retail Federation has projected that sales will grow 2.5 to 3.5 percent during the November and December shopping season compared with last year, but how those sales are split among retailers could be significant. Retailers that specialize in big-ticket purchases have struggled to attract price-conscious consumers, while those that offer cheaper and more essential items have thrived.
Target, for instance, which relies more on discretionary purchases than its rival Walmart, has performed more poorly in recent months than it had expected. On the company's most recent earnings call, its executives said that consumers were choosing cheaper items like candles and vases, eschewing televisions. At the same time, analysts say that businesses that emphasize budget items, like Walmart, have been better positioned.
But the preliminary numbers for overall industry sales indicated that some consumers appeared to be making the bigger purchases that they had been holding off on.
Ms. Schwartz said that Americans had been saying for months that they were waiting until Black Friday to start making "splurge purchases."
"The sales and order growth over the last few days implies that these shoppers stayed true to their word," Ms. Schwartz said in a statement.
Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Analytics, said that "bigger-than-expected discounts" drove higher spending, especially as consumers remained "very conscious of prices."
Over the past decade, Black Friday has transformed from a stand-alone day, where Americans hustled to snag the hottest new appliances and electronics at the lowest possible price, to a monthslong campaign of discounts. The ease of online shopping has meant fewer Americans go out to stores on Friday, even as it remains one of the busiest days of the year for retailers.
Proposed tariffs by President-elect Donald J. Trump may also be having an effect on consumer psychology, analysts say. Those tariffs may be spurring bigger-ticket purchases before businesses pass on heightened import costs.
Though it's difficult to predict the precise effect of these tariffs, particularly since they are still just proposals, they may be influencing how consumers think about holiday spending, said Lars Perner, an associate professor of clinical marketing at the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business.
"I would imagine that some people, worried about the massive tariffs -- especially on imports from China -- would take advantage of holiday bargains before costs could go up dramatically," Dr. Perner said.

A light show that drew thousands of tourists and holiday shoppers each winter -- with blinking, swirling, exploding spectacles that seemed to be growing more elaborate every year -- is no more.
Or, at least, it's not happening this year.
Saks Fifth Avenue has confirmed that it will not offer the popular light show at its flagship store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan this holiday season, in what appears to be a move to cut costs. The news began appearing on social media early this week, and was based on employees' accounts.
In confirming the decision, a representative for Saks told The New York Post on Monday that it had been a "challenging year for luxury."
The store said in a statement that it instead planned to celebrate the centenary of its flagship store by "honoring the architectural significance of this iconic building, elegantly illuminating the facade and framing the holiday windows."
Along with the department store's vaunted holiday windows, the light show had for nearly two decades drawn crowds to 611 Fifth Avenue, with many visitors pairing the show with a nighttime stop at the nearby Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.
In the statement, a spokeswoman for Saks Fifth Avenue noted that "for some time, we have contemplated changing our approach." Yet the decision appeared to have been made recently, with a news release from October including a mention of the light display, noting that like the celebrated Saks holiday windows, the display would be "presented by Mastercard."
It was not clear whether the decision to call off the light show represented a pause, or an end to the tradition, but Saks confirmed that it was not related to the company's relationship to Mastercard.
The annual light show, which began in 2004, was typically unveiled in late November and ran through early January. The display was timed to repeat every few minutes.
In its early years, the show involved a similar display every holiday season. Massive snowflakes projected onto the store's facade appeared and disappeared as Christmas music played. By 2010, the display grew more sophisticated, with bubbles that appeared to emerge from the store windows and float up the front of the building.
For several years, the display turned the store into a blinking castle, its pillars and spires changing color every several seconds under a fringe of icicles. Even during the pandemic, the show went on.
In 2022, as part of a collaboration with the Elton John AIDS Foundation, the show involved rocket ships, kaleidoscopic images and the musician himself playing "Your Song" at the unveiling.
Last year, in a partnership with Dior, the store created a so-called Carousel of Dreams with zodiac signs on a disc that pulsed with lights and appeared to spin like a roulette wheel, as music played and fireworks shot into the sky.
Money was no object then, or so it seemed.
On social media this week, many wondered about the company's decision to call off the light show precisely on the flagship store's 100th anniversary. "What better year to make an extravaganza?" said KaVonna Holloway, the host of "The Introvert's Social Hour" podcast.
"That's what people expect every year," Ms. Holloway said in a video on TikTok. "And you say, 'No, we're not going to do it. We're going to highlight the window displays.' Nobody wants that."

Full text: After he was mugged, he took a therapist's advice to work with "difficult students at a difficult school." They ignored him until the lessons turned to business.
Steve Mariotti, a teacher in some of New York's roughest schools who discovered that his bored, disrespectful students suddenly tuned in when he talked about running a business, inspiring him to create an organization that has taught business skills to more than 1 million at-risk youths in the U.S. and abroad, died on Oct. 20 in Union City, N.J. He was 71.
His death, at the home of a friend with whom he was living, was caused by a heart attack, according to the nonprofit organization that Mr. Mariotti founded in 1987, the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship, or NFTE.
Mr. Mariotti believed that imparting business basics to poor, mostly minority students who saw no connection between school and the quality of their lives could help them develop an interest in math and writing, improve their behavior, and instill a belief in themselves and a hope for the future.
The organization, which he started on his modest teacher's salary, now has a $ 12 million budget, oversees programs in 28 states and 27 countries, and reports that 80 percent of its alumni have earned or are earning college degrees or professional certificates.
Jasmine Lawrence Campbell, an alumna of a NFTE course, who founded EDEN BodyWorks, a beauty products line sold in Walmart, wrote on LinkedIn: "There would be no EDEN BodyWorks without NFTE. I'm so grateful for the organization Steve Mariotti founded that radically changed the course of my life."
Mr. Mariotti's own life was changed by an emotionally shattering episode that led him to become a teacher.
In 1981, when he owned a small import-export business in New York, he was mugged by six teenage boys while jogging along the East River. Angry that he had only $ 10 in his running shorts, the boys punched him, flashed knives and threatened to throw him into the river.
After the attack, Mr. Mariotti was plagued by nightmares and a sense of humiliation. When a therapist diagnosed post-traumatic stress syndrome and advised him that he could conquer it by becoming "a teacher of difficult students in a difficult school," Mr. Mariotti left his business and began teaching remedial math at Boys and Girls High School, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.
His new students mocked him as "Mr. Manicotti" while blasting music in class and dancing on his desk. It was only when he introduced a lesson on how businesses made profits -- distributing handfuls of coins for a game in which they pretended to be a shopkeeper and customers -- that they began to pay attention.
"Whenever I could tie a lesson to entrepreneurship, I had my students' rapt attention," Mr. Mariotti wrote in his memoir, "Goodbye Homeboy: How My Students Drove Me Crazy and Inspired a Movement," published in 2019. "I consistently witnessed angry, disillusioned teenagers light up whenever I explained that entrepreneurship is a viable way for anyone to earn money and create a pathway out of poverty."
At a second school, Jane Addams Vocational High School in the South Bronx (now Jane Addams High School for Academic Careers), Mr. Mariotti encouraged students to start their own small businesses -- braiding hair, for example, or peddling sunglasses bought from wholesalers in Midtown Manhattan.
"I discovered that my low-income students had a natural aptitude for entrepreneurship, born of their stressful lives," he wrote. "They were comfortable with risk and ambiguity. They were brave and unselfconscious. They were gutsy and resilient, and they were natural salespeople."
In 1987, when he expanded the in-school program into an all-day venture for the most troubled students, it was profiled by The New York Times and ABC's "World News Tonight With Peter Jennings."
The next year, after he left his teaching job, Mr. Mariotti was able to reach 200 students in the New York City area through a workshop. By 1991, his program, now known as NFTE (pronounced "nifty"), had partnered with an organization in Kansas and opened an office in New England, which led to rapid growth. The entrepreneurial curriculum that he and others developed was published by Pearson Education in 2005 as a textbook, "How to Start & Operate a Small Business."
By 2006, one-third of NFTE's funding came from the Goldman Sachs Foundation. In 2011, the winners of its national entrepreneurship challenge were welcomed at the White House. The organization's 25th anniversary was marked by a gala fund-raiser in 2013 at the Waldorf Astoria hotel, sponsored by Mastercard, Ernst & Young, Microsoft and others.
That same year, a study by a doctoral student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education found that students who had taken a NFTE course had a higher graduation rate than the national average. They were also more likely to be employed, and one out of five NFTE alumni with jobs were self-employed, compared with the national average of one out of nine people.
Steve John Mariotti was born on Aug. 14, 1953, in Ann Arbor, Mich., and raised in nearby Flint. His mother, Nancy (Mason) Mariotti, was a special-education teacher; his father, John J. Mariotti, taught industrial engineering at the General Motors Institute.
His maternal grandfather, Lowell B. Mason, was a longtime lawyer for Ayn Rand, the popular author of novels like "Atlas Shrugged" (1957), which lionized entrepreneurs. For years he looked up to her. (The spell was broken after he met her in New York and mentioned that he had attended a gay-rights event; she later wrote to him forbidding further contact because of his support for "the immoral acts of homosexuals," he wrote in his memoir.)
Dreaming of a career in the auto industry, Mr. Mariotti earned a B.A. in economics as well as an M.B.A. from the University of Michigan, graduating in 1977. He was hired as a financial analyst at Ford Motor Company, but was ultimately fired, he wrote, because of his memos questioning the company's business in apartheid South Africa. Soon after, he moved to New York, where he started a small business importing artisan-made goods from Jamaica, Kenya and other countries.
He retired as president of NFTE in 2015. He is survived by a brother, Jack.
Years after Mr. Mariotti's traumatic mugging, one of his assailants walked into an entrepreneurship class he was teaching at Seward Park High School, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The two recognized each another but weren't sure from where. Then the memory flooded back.
"We shook hands and agreed to let bygones be bygones," Mr. Mariotti wrote. "He turned out to be a wonderful young man who was working hard to change his life and improve his prospects."

Full text: The share of debit transactions in the U.S. that the government says is run on Visa's network.
The Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Visa on Tuesday, accusing the company of holding a monopoly over debit cards. Visa, the government said, processed more than 60 percent of debit transactions in the United States last year.
"Visa abuses its monopoly power to thwart existing debit rivals and buy off would-be rivals at the expense of consumers, merchants, banks and the competitive process itself," Doha Mekki, the principal deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department's antitrust division, said in a statement.
Julie Rottenberg, Visa's general counsel, called the suit "meritless" and said Visa would defend itself against it.
Visa charges merchants for using its payment networks. The government claims that those fees have gotten needlessly high because Visa has forced the merchants into primarily using its network. If merchants use other networks, Visa charges, or threatens to impose, even higher processing fees.
The lack of competition allowed Visa to generate more than $ 7 billion in processing fees per year while squeezing out potential competitors in the debit card market like PayPal and Square, the suit claims.
The Biden administration's antitrust enforcers argue that spurring competition, including by cracking down on corporate middlemen like Visa and, more broadly, companies that charge "junk fees," will protect small companies and consumers.
It is unclear how successful these efforts will be. The administration's move to cap late fees on credit card payments at $ 8 was blocked by a federal court in May. And a recent settlement to cap the credit card swipe fees that Visa and Mastercard charge merchants fell short of what was needed, according to merchant trade groups.

Government Accuses Visa Of Monopoly In Debit Use: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The financial giant, which processes the majority of debit card spending in the United States, unfairly imposed fees on merchants and deterred rivals, the Justice Department said.
The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Visa on Tuesday, accusing the financial giant of unfairly stifling competition in debit cards, the latest in a string of cases aimed at deterring monopolistic behavior by big companies.
For more than a decade, the government claims in its complaint, Visa has entered into de facto exclusive agreements with merchants and banks, encouraging them to route the bulk of their transactions through Visa's payment network. The company has maintained a monopoly in large part by imposing or threatening to impose higher fees on merchants that also use other payment networks to process debit transactions, according to the Justice Department.
The lawsuit stems from a sweeping investigation dating back years. It is part of a series of efforts made by enforcers under the Biden administration to target corporate middlemen, which it says needlessly increase fees, and take aim at power wielded by companies spanning technology to agriculture. President Biden in 2021 rolled out an executive order that made aggressive antitrust enforcement a pillar of his economic policy.
Visa is a very big middleman: It processed $ 3.8 trillion in U.S. debit transactions in the year through June, generating over $ 7 billion in processing fees per year, the Justice Department said. Those account for more than 60 percent of all such transactions.
"Visa's unlawful conduct affects not just the price of one thing, but the price of nearly everything," Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in a statement accompanying the complaint, which was filed in the Southern District of New York.
Visa's fees, which are largely invisible to the public, are paid by merchants and can be passed on to consumers, hitting younger and lower-income Americans the hardest, Benjamin Mizer, the Justice Department's third-ranking official, said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Julie Rottenberg, Visa's general counsel, said in statement: "Today's lawsuit ignores the reality that Visa is just one of many competitors in a debit space that is growing, with entrants who are thriving."
Ms. Rottenberg added, "This lawsuit is meritless, and we will defend ourselves vigorously."
The antitrust violations outlined in the government's complaint encompass all debit transactions using a physical card, as well as online or app-based purchases. Suppressing alternative card networks, which connect a card holder's bank to the merchant's bank when a purchase is made, has reduced competition in the market and "slowed innovation in the debit payments ecosystem," the Justice Department said.
The government also claims that Visa has deterred other companies, such as PayPal and Square, from entering the debit card market. It says that Visa has paid financial technology companies to be partners, rather than let them evolve into rivals, citing internal Visa documents.
"Visa abuses its monopoly power to thwart existing debit rivals and buy off would-be rivals at the expense of consumers, merchants, banks and the competitive process itself," Doha Mekki, the principal deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department's antitrust division, said in a statement.
The department's concerns with Visa are longstanding. Its antitrust division in 2020 sued to block Visa's $ 5.3 billion deal to acquire the financial technology firm Plaid, arguing that Visa intended to stamp out a nascent rival. In that suit, the Justice Department said that Visa already had "a decisive market position through its online debit monopoly, and would unlawfully extend that advantage by acquiring Plaid."
Visa and Plaid abandoned their deal two months later.
Federal antitrust regulators have scrutinized Mastercard, too, over allegations that it has illegally suppressed competing debit payment networks. Visa and Mastercard together dominate the payments industry and have fought allegations that they maintain a duopoly. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission reached an agreement with Mastercard that requires the company to share customer account information with competing networks and allow merchants to choose between rival networks.
The Justice Department has not yet decided what it will require from Visa to resolve the lawsuit, said a senior Justice Department official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Analysts at Wells Fargo said they believed the review "will play out over a long period of time," adding that "often these situations get resolved with manageable mitigation."
Shares of Visa fell more than 5 percent on Tuesday, their steepest daily decline this year.
The lawsuit comes amid a broader focus by regulators on the finance industry. This month, the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation voted in favor of putting in place more stringent guidelines for evaluating bank deals. The same day, the Justice Department announced it was withdrawing from a framework established in 1995 that had guided how it had evaluated deals. The move will most likely toughen its scrutiny of banking mergers.
These actions in tandem send mixed signals about how officials will handle Capital One's pending $ 35.3 billion acquisition of Discover Financial Services, which banking regulators are currently reviewing. On the one hand, they could signify intense scrutiny of the industry by regulators. On the other, the lawsuit against Visa could draw attention to an argument made by Capital One and Discover that merging would create a stronger competitor to Visa and Mastercard.
The Biden administration recently faced a setback when a move by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to cap late fees on credit card payments at $ 8 a month was temporarily blocked by a federal judge. Last week, former President Donald J. Trump revived the debate by proposing a cap on credit card interest rates.
In their crackdown on corporate intermediaries and "junk fees," President Biden's antitrust enforcers have also taken on companies including Live Nation Entertainment, which owns Ticketmaster, and RealPage, a maker of property management software.

Healthy Sales Outlook
For Holiday Season
Retail sales are expected to rise 3.2 percent in the holiday season as companies look to deals to attract thrifty shoppers during a shorter-than-usual shopping window this year, a Mastercard forecast showed on Thursday.
In comparison, retail sales rose 3.1 percent between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24 of 2023, according to the report from Mastercard Economics Institute. Mastercard SpendingPulse measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment.
With consumers expected to be picky about their spending this year, retailers from Walmart and Target to Amazon.com, Shein and Temu are all likely to roll out aggressive deals.
A Deloitte forecast showed U.S. holiday sales are expected to grow at their slowest pace in six years.
Online sales are expected to jump 7.1 percent during the holiday season from last year, according to the Mastercard report. REUTERS
ENTERTAINMENT
Movie Theater Chains Plan $ 2.2 Billion Upgrade
The largest theater chains, including AMC Entertainment, Regal Cinemas and Cinemark, will invest more than $ 2.2 billion over the next three years to upgrade theaters in the U.S. and Canada, an industry group announced on Thursday.
Improvements will be made by the eight biggest theater chains in the region, representing over 21,000 screens and 67 percent of box office sales, according to the National Association of Theatre Owners.
The movie business has faced multiple challenges from the rise of streaming to the Covid-19 pandemic and the Hollywood strikes in 2023.
The industry group said the funds would be used for various projects, including more comfortable seating, immersive sound and laser projection technology and improving air conditioning, carpeting and food and beverage options. REUTERS
AUTOMOBILES
G.M. Self-Driving Cars
To Be Tested in Bay Area
General Motors' self-driving unit Cruise said on Thursday it will begin supervised testing with up to five autonomous vehicles this fall in California's Bay Area.
Cruise will deploy several manual mapping vehicles in Sunnyvale and Mountain View before beginning testing, it said in a post on X.
The company resumed operations in the United States with a small fleet of human-driven vehicles in Arizona in April, about six months after the self-driving car unit paused operations following an incident in San Francisco.
Cruise had suspended operations last October after a pedestrian in San Francisco hit by another car was dragged by one of its robotaxis.
The California Department of Motor Vehicles issued draft regulations on the operation of autonomous vehicles on highways in August, paving the way for self-driving trucks to commence long-haul deliveries. REUTERS

U.S. Says Software Maker Enabled Collusion on Rents: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Justice Department filed an antitrust suit against the real estate software company, accusing it of creating an illegal pricing scheme to charge tenants more.
The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit on Friday against the real estate software company RealPage, saying its software enabled landlords to collude to raise rents across the United States.
The suit, joined by North Carolina, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Minnesota, Oregon, Tennessee and Washington, accuses RealPage of facilitating a price-fixing conspiracy that boosted rents beyond market forces for millions of people. It's the first major civil antitrust lawsuit where the role of an algorithm in pricing manipulation is central to the case, Justice Department officials said.
"Americans should not have to pay more in rent because a company has found a new way to scheme with landlords to break the law," Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.
A RealPage spokeswoman, Jennifer Bowcock, said the company would "vigorously" defend itself against the suit and that its revenue management software was "purposely built to be legally compliant."
The suit escalates the government's efforts to regulate what it says is misuse of technology. Officials have sued Google, Amazon, Meta and Apple over what they said were monopolistic behaviors that harm consumers.
RealPage's software, YieldStar, gathers confidential real estate information and is at the heart of the government's concerns. Landlords, who pay to use the software, share information about rents and occupancy rates that is otherwise confidential. Based on that data, an algorithm generates suggestions for what landlords should charge renters, and those figures are often higher than they would be in a competitive market, according to allegations in the legal complaint.
The government's suit, filed in the Middle District of North Carolina, also accuses RealPage of monopolizing the market for software that landlords use to set prices for apartments. Properties containing about three million rental housing units use RealPage's software, and the company has access to confidential information from over 16 million units across the country, according to the complaint.
Owned by the private equity firm Thoma Bravo, RealPage has advertised its software to landlords as a tool that can help them earn 3 percent to 7 percent more than they would otherwise, and says its software is used in metro areas around the country. The government's complaint cites comments from RealPage executives, who have described the company's software as a tool for landlords to raise prices and avoid competition.
RealPage's software ensures landlords are "driving every possible opportunity to increase price even in the most downward trending or unexpected conditions," the company said, according to the government's complaint. In another instance, a landlord called the tool "classic price fixing," according to the complaint.
RealPage has previously denied allegations of illegal collusion, arguing that landlords are not obliged to accept its software's suggestions when setting rents. Other economic factors, like an undersupply of housing units, are to blame for driving up rents nationwide, the company has said.
RealPage has "a history of working constructively with the D.O.J." to show the software complies with the law, Ms. Bowcock said. In 2017 RealPage acquired a rival software provider, which the Justice Department had scrutinized at the time and ultimately approved.
A spokeswoman for Thoma Bravo declined to comment.
Beyond typical investigative tools like reviewing internal documents, the government commissioned data scientists to analyze the code RealPage relies on to set rents, Jonathan Kanter, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said at a news conference Friday.
"The modern machinery of algorithms and A.I. can be even more effective than the smoke-filled rooms of the past," he said.
The cost of housing has become a political issue in the lead-up to the presidential election in November. Rent increases have been a driver of unusually strong inflation. Annual rent growth nationally peaked at nearly 16 percent in early 2022, according to data from the real estate site Zillow.
"We've had multiple years of high growth in housing prices," said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director at the Open Markets Institute, a research and advocacy group focused on antitrust issues. "There's no single factor accounting for the rise in rents, but I think RealPage is an underrated contributor."
In a speech this month, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, cited collusion among corporate landlords, including via price-setting software, as an anticompetitive practice that drives up rental costs.
In November, Attorney General Brian Schwalb of the District of Columbia sued RealPage and 14 of the largest landlords in the district, the first such lawsuit by a public agency. The Arizona attorney general, Kris Mayes, followed in February, accusing RealPage and nine landlords of illegally conspiring to raise rents for hundreds of thousands of renters in the Phoenix and Tucson areas.
Regulators have been more broadly examining the impact of algorithms on prices throughout the economy. Algorithms are used to help effectively set prices by ride hailing companies that deploy "surge pricing" during high demand, and by colleges, where administrators calculate how much money to offer applicants in financial aid.
In addition to the lawsuit against RealPage, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have weighed in on private lawsuits over whether hotel companies colluded by using algorithms to help determine room rates.
But it can be difficult for regulators to build these cases, experts said.
"The algorithm itself can serve as a mechanism for communication," said Diana Moss, director of competition policy at the Progressive Policy Institute. "That is as approachable and actionable under U.S. antitrust as any form of communication we've seen in past cases in the nondigital era."
The Federal Trade Commission began a study in July of how companies use data from customers to set prices. It asked eight firms about their practices, including Mastercard, JPMorganChase and the consulting giants McKinsey & Company and Accenture.
Algorithms do not operate in a law-free zone, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at the news conference.
"After all, humans create them," Ms. Monaco said. "Our laws will always apply to the people behind the machines and the companies behind the algorithms."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When a draft of a blockbuster Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade leaked in 2022, Vice President Kamala Harris met with Ron Klain, then the White House chief of staff, in her West Wing office. He had an idea: She should lead a new task force on abortion rights.
She seemed uncertain. "Why?" she asked.
"We need a real leader, and you're the leader," Mr. Klain responded.
Ms. Harris asked for time to think about it. She did not want to just give a speech without substance. And she had spent much of the previous year and a half trying to avoid being typecast as the first female vice president. But as the White House began mapping out executive actions to defend access to abortion, she began to see the possibilities and accepted the role.
It was a moment that captured the essence of the Harris vice presidency. Deliberate and disciplined, cautious and at times risk averse, she saw trapdoors around her and wanted to avoid them. She considered herself a team player, but could not always be sure the team had her best interests at heart. She gravitated to issues on which she thought she could make a difference without upstaging President Biden, but was rarely promoted as a critical player in the administration.
The court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision eliminating a constitutional right to abortion proved to be an issue on which Ms. Harris could take the lead, one that Mr. Biden, a churchgoing Catholic, did not feel as comfortable addressing. She found her voice as the administration's champion of abortion rights, changing some minds among Democrats who had harbored doubts about her. And she paved the way to the moment when she will accept her party's nomination for president this week.
Ms. Harris's record as vice president is complex, as described in interviews with dozens of current and former administration officials and allies, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid alienating her or the president. She has done the dutiful things she has been asked to do. She led a labor task force and a gun safety office. She traveled to places the president had no time to visit. She has been sent to deliver private messages to the leaders of Poland and Germany and to break key tie votes in the Senate.
She rarely took positions at odds with the president's, at least not in meetings attended by others, but she made her mark quietly at times. She pushed him to pick Ketanji Brown Jackson for the Supreme Court when he was getting advice to the contrary. Her candidate was selected for the head of the World Bank.
She developed arguments to make Mr. Biden comfortable with approving expansive student debt relief when he hesitated. She lobbied him to endorse an exception to the Senate filibuster rule to push forward voting rights legislation. And she advocated speaking out early on the impact of the Dobbs decision on in vitro fertilization despite resistance from some in the West Wing.
But she was also saddled with no-win assignments, most notably tackling the root causes of illegal immigration from Central America, exposing her to Republican criticism. Stung by an early television interview that went awry, she became skittish about mistakes, asking whether an appearance or a line in a speech might produce another vicious viral clip. And her allies believed the president's staff often clipped her wings, appropriating her initiatives for him to announce without building up her own public profile.
"She would be very careful to make sure she was making a constructive contribution," Mr. Klain said in an interview. "Most often when you're vice president, that's behind closed doors, so she did that. But I don't think it's a question of caution. I think it's a question of loyalty and dedication and focus on the mission."
At the same time, he acknowledged that she was not always well served by the White House. "We were all united behind the idea she should be successful. We just didn't find the path to do it," he said.
"People really liked her," Mr. Klain added. "There's a lot of enthusiasm for her. And I don't think we did a good enough job of selling her."
A Learning Curve
Being vice president is one of the trickiest jobs in Washington. It comes with a nice blue-and-white plane, a lovely mansion and a decent office in the West Wing, but nothing is guaranteed. The old saw is that there are only two job requirements for the vice president in the Constitution -- presiding over the Senate and checking to see how the president is feeling each morning. As Walter F. Mondale famously put it, the vice president essentially is "standby equipment."
Its only real power is derivative, depending entirely on the whim of the president and the skill of a vice president to find openings to make oneself relevant without crossing the boss. The challenge for Ms. Harris was especially pronounced because she was flowing against the historical tide.
Until she came along, every vice president but one going back to 1977 had more experience in Washington than the president they served and therefore could provide wisdom, guidance and connections. (Think Mr. Mondale for Jimmy Carter, Dick Cheney for George W. Bush and Mr. Biden for Barack Obama.)
After a half-century in Washington, Mr. Biden did not need Ms. Harris to explain the capital to him, or at least did not think he did. She came with scant experience in international affairs that the former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman particularly valued. He did not assign her to lead major negotiations with lawmakers as Mr. Obama had him do.
"The main thing was you don't get in the way of a sitting president," said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian she consulted about her role. "Vice presidents need to stay somewhat second tier and in the shadows. You can't have a Biden foreign policy and here's the Harris one. I had a feeling she wanted to follow recent ones like how Barack Obama and Joe Biden collaborated or Bill Clinton and Al Gore -- ones that were functional."
Ms. Harris came into the role without a close relationship with her new president. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the two did not campaign together much in 2020, and there were sore feelings among some around Mr. Biden, including Jill Biden, stemming from Ms. Harris's attack on him during a Democratic primary debate over his position on busing to integrate schools in the 1970s.
Mr. Biden made a point of offering her the same access Mr. Obama had given him, including a weekly lunch when the two were both in town.
"When I started running the transition, the president's first directive to me was the vice president must be involved in every decision that hits his desk, from start to finish," said Jeffrey D. Zients, who was co-chair of the transition and succeeded Mr. Klain as chief of staff.
But she had limited time in Washington at that point. She had spent only a couple years as a senator before starting her run for the presidency. "She had a learning curve as vice president like Joe Biden had a learning curve as vice president," said Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina.
He noted that a lot of people assumed she was vice president only because she was a Black woman, a perception that was unfair but hard to shake. "They didn't give her time to learn or room to grow," Mr. Clyburn said. "That was the problem."
Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the assistant Democratic leader, said partnerships between presidents and vice presidents are inherently challenging. "This is a tough assignment, being vice president," he said. "It's fraught with tension and rivalry and history." But for all that, he added, "I don't see any of that in the relationship between Kamala and Joe Biden."
Taking Grief
As she settled into the West Wing, Ms. Harris set her style. Like the former prosecutor she was, she grilled staff members, stoking anxiety. Her team went through multiple shake-ups early in the administration.
Some former White House officials described her as a "tough boss" who would challenge aides she sensed were unprepared. "Are we ready to go?" she would say. "Let's go."
While Mr. Biden's meetings could meander for hours, Ms. Harris insisted aides be concise, prepared and to the point. She regularly interjected, pushing for evidence or details. She demanded that staff members imagine themselves in the place of people affected by policies. If aides filibustered, she declared it was time to move on. Her team knew that briefings were not to stretch beyond 45 minutes.
"She wanted to keep things tight," said Ricardo Zúñiga, who served as the State Department's special envoy for Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and worked with Ms. Harris on migration issues. "The meetings ended on time. She did not like people who just kind of went on. Which is good."
Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, said she was disciplined about pushing for help for small businesses and community financial institutions. "She is both someone who calls on a regular basis to ask how things are going and then requests more information by paper," he said.
Views vary on whether she was herself well prepared. Most current and former administration officials interviewed described her as a diligent consumer of background briefings, but there were some who said they found the opposite and were surprised that she would be unprepared before some meetings.
Some attributed that to Ms. Harris's preference not to read at night, unlike many politicians, but instead read in the morning, meaning that she did not necessarily arrive at the office as ready as she would be later in the day.
However much she read, some outside the administration came to feel that she was not as interested in contradictory views. Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, said he tried to reach out to her team to talk about border security but his requests were never answered.
"I don't want to say I told you so, but it did happen the way I said it would happen," Mr. Cuellar said of the record levels of illegal border crossings earlier in Mr. Biden's presidency. "I think anyone that's dealt with this issue knows that it's a very difficult issue, and I do think she distanced herself."
Ms. Harris's interview with Lester Holt of NBC News in June 2021 proved an early turning point. When Mr. Holt asked why she had not visited the border if she was going to work on immigration issues, she snapped, "And I haven't been to Europe."
She was deeply bruised by the ensuing backlash. "She felt like that interview had set us back, and she felt bad about that," Mr. Klain said.
He recalled trying to find photographs of her visiting the border when she was California attorney general in hopes of rebutting Republican critics. "We wanted to try to find proof that she'd been there during that, but never could find pictures or anything," he said. "But look, I thought she did a very good job with her part of the assignment, and she was taking grief needlessly."
She largely avoided major interviews for many months and second-guessed herself regularly. She asked aides whether she should laugh in public for fear that it would be used to ridicule her. While editing speech drafts, she would single out lines to ask if they would provide fodder for Fox News segments attacking her.
Overseas Messenger
Ms. Harris spent much of her first two years on Capitol Hill, where her tiebreaking vote gave Democrats control of a Senate then divided 50 to 50. She has broken 33 ties, more than any vice president in American history.
While most of those were to confirm appointments, she also provided the decisive vote to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, a catchall measure that included the largest ever investment in clean energy, higher corporate taxes and provisions helping seniors pay for medicine, including a $ 35-a-month cap on insulin.
But there is little testimony that she played a significant role in brokering the deals leading up to such legislation. She was acutely deferential to Mr. Biden, who had spent 36 years in the Senate and considered himself a master legislator, even if his experience on Capitol Hill was dated.
When Democrats wanted Mr. Biden to come out in favor of eliminating the Senate filibuster for voting rights legislation, they recommended to Ms. Harris's staff that she prod him into doing it by coming out publicly for such a move herself -- doing to Mr. Biden what he once did to Mr. Obama on same-sex marriage. She refused, instead preferring to push the president privately until he did finally agree, although they still failed to muster enough support to change the rule.
Ms. Harris likewise was careful not to contradict Mr. Biden on foreign policy, another area of expertise for him. She supported his decision to pull American troops out of Afghanistan, which led to a chaotic withdrawal and a Taliban return to power. She backed his efforts to stand by Ukraine against Russia's invasion and Israel against Hamas terrorism, although she publicly emphasized concern for Palestinian suffering in Gaza more than he did.
Where she privately differed from Mr. Biden on foreign policy was more on framing. She did not think much of his democracy versus autocracy theme, reasoning that a number of close American allies are not democracies. Instead, aides said, she sees foreign affairs through the lens of her legal background, stressing America's role in defending the international rules-based order. Their different approaches, however, generally led to the same conclusion.
Ms. Harris often served as Mr. Biden's messenger overseas. She represented him for three years in a row at the Munich Security Conference. At the first, she met with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine just five days before Russia's invasion in February 2022 and tried to warn him about what was coming. At the second, she declared that Russia had committed "crimes against humanity." At the third, she quietly talked with foreign leaders as part of an effort to broker what would become the largest East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War.
On another occasion, she was on Air Force Two flying to Warsaw when she received a call from Mr. Biden telling her to warn Polish leaders against sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. In their private meeting, Ms. Harris told President Andrzej Duda of Poland that such a move would risk escalation. He agreed to work it out through NATO channels.
Outside the Box
Much of Ms. Harris's work in the Biden administration focused on issues that were important but did not often make headlines.
She was put in charge of or took interest in a variety of subjects, including child care and paid leave, maternal health, artificial intelligence, maritime security, housing, community banks, community health centers and the child tax credit. She helped raise billions of dollars in private and public funds to address poverty and corruption in Central America.
A particular interest was gun violence. Chiraag Bains, then a policy adviser to the president, recalled walking into the dining room off the Oval Office in June 2021 to find Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris talking about the issue over salads. "I remember the vice president being energetically engaged and sort of advising the president to be as aggressive as possible to take federal action to reduce gun violence," Mr. Bains said.
When Mr. Biden created the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention last year, he put Ms. Harris in charge of it. She visited the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., the site of a 2018 mass shooting, to announce the creation of a center to help states enforce red-flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.
Gregory Jackson, deputy director of the office and a gun violence survivor, said more than 420 gun stores had been shut down for violations. "We have a vice president that pushes and pushes our team to always think outside the box," he said.
The vice president has played a role in significant personnel choices as well. When Mr. Biden was considering a new president of the World Bank, Ms. Harris successfully proposed Ajay Banga, a former Mastercard chief executive.
She was also deeply involved in Mr. Biden's only Supreme Court appointment, interviewing all three finalists and studying their legal records. While she considered Leondra R. Kruger, a California Supreme Court justice, a "very sharp lawyer," she concluded that the justice might be too cautious for the moment, according to a former White House official.
J. Michelle Childs, then a district judge, had the support of both Mr. Clyburn and Senator Joe Manchin III, then a Democrat from West Virginia, making her the choice of least resistance. But Ms. Harris concluded that Ketanji Brown Jackson, a federal appeals judge, would be the boldest option, the former official and Mr. Klain said. "Joe, you may only get one chance to do this as president, and you want to be proud of your legacy here," she told Mr. Biden, according to Mr. Klain.
She found other moments to influence Mr. Biden. When he was reluctant to use executive authority to provide extensive student debt relief, she had a memo drafted addressing his concerns. To his worry about benefiting "private elite schools," the memo said she could counter by saying that "only 0.3 percent of federal loan borrowers attended Ivy League schools." In response to his preference for legislation rather than executive action, the memo noted that he was already relying on his own authority to pause loan payments.
Former Labor Secretary Martin J. Walsh, who led a task force on worker empowerment with Ms. Harris while in the administration, said that she was strikingly detail-oriented. "Staff gets into the weeds on this stuff, but you wouldn't think a principal would," he said. "And she really, really got into the weeds -- in a good way."
Mitch Landrieu, who oversaw the administration's implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure program, said Ms. Harris has "really got good policy chops" and was "integrally involved" in how to structure initiatives like expanding broadband internet service and replacing lead pipes.
At first, he said, "people did not give her a benefit of the doubt, and I think they tried to caricature her and they were harsh." But he added, "everybody grows into the job."
A Historic Decision
Air Force Two was just taking off when the Supreme Court issued its decision overturning Roe v. Wade, several weeks after Mr. Klain first walked into her office.
Ms. Harris was heading to Chicago to talk about maternal health, but scrapped the speech. The first woman elected to national office, Ms. Harris knew that all eyes would be on her. "She got very focused, very fast," recalled Senator Durbin, who was accompanying her that day.
While her plane cruised west, her legal team in Washington went over the ruling line by line and sent her takeaways. "Are they actually going this far on this?" she asked, according to a former aide. Ms. Harris was particularly focused on Justice Clarence Thomas's concurrence suggesting that same-sex marriage or contraceptive rights could be next.
When she landed, Ms. Harris headed to the Y.M.C.A. in Plainfield, Ill., where she was scheduled to visit, but skipped the tour to huddle in a room with her staff to craft a new speech.
Three hours later, she finally took the microphone, denouncing what she said was "the first time in the history of our nation that a constitutional right has been taken from the people of America."
Whether she realized it at the time or not, it was the start of a new chapter in her vice presidency. It may have taken her a few hours to decide how to say it, but in the end, she knew what she wanted to say. "She knew this was a historic decision," Mr. Durbin said, "and she wanted to get it right."

Full text: Subterranean Shops Going Under
Readers responded at nytimes.com to Matthew Haag's article last Sunday about now-vacant retail spaces in New York's transit network. Comments were edited. The solution to this is to make it local: Make contracts with local businesses with a rent rate connected to the site's gross income, with the trade-off for a generous lease being that they have open and honest bookkeeping and understand that attempts to defraud will come with eviction and harsh penalties. This keeps the area vibrant and puts less focus on monetizing it for the city and instead allows small businesses to succeed with less pressure on affording the rent in the short term and flexibility to bow out if they can't find success.
Dennis Deitch, Seaville, N.J.
The M.T.A. should substantially reduce rents or eliminate them for a fee charged against gross income. Sort of like the fee American Express, Mastercard or Visa charges businesses for the service provided.
Donald L. Haney, Alpine, Texas
The M.T.A. should focus on one thing above all: cleanliness. It's one thing for a platform or walkway to be old -- it's another for it to be looking like no one has washed it in a hundred years. Clean up the system and have roving teams of sanitation workers constantly cleaning, and it will give the impression that the system is cared for, getting better every day, and is safe. Then the customers and businesses will return.
Mark Lusardi, New York
Am I going to hang out any longer than absolutely necessary in the Port Authority subway station? Do I want to amble through the food court and shops in the Columbus Circle station? How often do I want to do some window shopping in the Fulton Street station? The answer to all those questions is never. Almost all the stations in the system are dark and dirty, frequently dangerous, an unpleasant necessity in order to get from Point A to Point B. I feel sorry for the shop owners who thought they could make a go at it in these dark passageways, but perhaps they could have first asked a cross section of us daily subway riders where we prefer to do our shopping and eating.
Robert Brenneman, New York
The real reason for the empty storefronts is that our perverted tax structure makes it more profitable to write off a vacant space than to rent it out at a sustainable market price. The city has always had criminals and weirdos. How bad the problem is seems to scale directly to how many of those vacant storefronts there are. When the city is bustling, the urban problems recede. When and where there is less traffic, less business, and more empty storefronts, the blight is palpable and people don't feel safe. Landlords are creating this problem because public policy incentivizes them to do so. That is causing the empty storefronts, which causes the crime. The sensationalist press that wants to blame crime as the cause (because of their ax to grind about "liberal policing") have it backward. Crime is the effect. This isn't some liberal theory. In fact, it's straight out of the playbook of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the so-called America's mayor. Empty storefronts and broken windows cause crime.

Massara
Striding through his restaurant's beautifully paved dining room, Stefano Secchi marveled at the space. His lanky wingspan might reach wall to wall at Rezdôra, where he made his name, but not here where a bar and an open kitchen with a wood-fueled pizza oven frame the main floor tables. Upstairs there's a larger dining room. He's putting Campania, where he spent time in his youth, on the plate with seafood; stews; grilled meats, including goat; and pasta, both fresh and dried. "Food in 2024 has to be regional," he said. The Neapolitan pizzettes depend on sourdough starter he's nurtured for years, and Italian wines go no further north than Tuscany.

Eel Bar
There's nothing cookie-cutter in the group of Brooklyn and Manhattan restaurants alongside Cervo's, including Hart's, Minnow and the Fly. Eel Bar, a 65-seater in the Lower East Side, is an excellent new addition, looking to the Basque Country and beyond for fried mussels on the half shell; piquillo peppers with crab, white asparagus with mayonnaise and bottarga; half chicken al ajillo; and a burger with Roquefort and anchovies. Aaron Crowder, the chef of Cervo's, is running this kitchen. A dark wood bar area segues into a pair of small dining rooms upholstered in forest corduroy with a view of the open kitchen. (Opens Thursday)

L'Incontro by Rocco
The Italian chef, Rocco Sacramone, has moved his popular Astoria restaurant to Manhattan's Upper East Side, tweaking the name. The menu is again filled with crowdpleasers from his broad Italian repertoire.

Carnitas Ramírez
With high praise for their Taqueria Ramírez in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, listed on Pete Wells's 2023 best restaurant list, Giovanni Cervantes, the chef, and his partner, Tania Apolinar, have switched focus from assorted tacos to carnitas. Their nose-to-tail mix of pork cuts is simmered in lard, dusted with salt and hugged by a golden taco. (Friday)

Midnight by Navarro's
Christian Navarro, the former president of Wally's, a wine shop and restaurant in Beverly Hills, Calif., is running this replacement for Hidden Leaf in Midnight Theater in Midtown West. The chef, Ryan Kluver, was the executive chef at Wally's. Here, they have a wine bar open all day and a restaurant with a French and Californian approach.

LDV at the Maidstone
John Meadow, whose LDV Hospitality already has a Hamptons presence with Scarpetta in Montauk, has partnered with the owners of the Maidstone Hotel to manage the property and run its restaurant and bar. The menu, by the chef Jorge Espinoza, is seaside Italian. (Thursday)
207 Main Street (Mill Hill Lane), 631-324-5006, themaidstone.com.
Shark Bar
Vanessa Price and the chef Jeremy Blutstein, who own Mavericks Montauk, have opened this stop on the Napeague stretch. The typical clam bar menu goes rogue with a fish sandwich with trout roe, a merguez Chicago dog, grilled local royal red shrimp and fried oysters with tomatillo chow chow.

Branches
Fonda
Roberto Santibañez's Brooklyn Mexican restaurant, Fonda, has several branches already. Another, called Fonda 12 South, is in Nashville. And in partnership with Takayoshi Umeno, who is the president Joe's Shanghai Japan Inc., he has also extended Fonda's reach to Tokyo, at Fonda Mexicana.

Looking Ahead
Shaver Hall
Named for Dorothy Shaver who made Lord & Taylor one of New York's essential fashion-forward department stores, this food hall, opening in about a year, will occupy 35,000 square feet of the ground floor in the landmark building, now an Amazon property called Hank. The Food Hall Co. will bring in two restaurants, two bars and 11 stalls.
424 Fifth Avenue (39th Street).
Leon's
The chef Nick Anderer and his wife, Natalie Johnson, who own the quintessential neighborhood spot, Anton's in the West Village, are planning a sibling across town for early fall. The menu will be Italian with French and Egyptian touches. The restaurant is named for Ms. Johnson's great-grandfather from Alexandria.
817 Broadway (12th Street).
Chefs on the Move
John Fraser
This chef and restaurateur is responsible for creating the food at Casa Cruz New York, a clubby Upper East Side London import. He's redoing the menus and creating Frances at Casa Cruz on the roof.
Justin Binnie
The former pastry chef at Empellón has now moved on to Francie in Brooklyn, where he is in charge of pastry.
Shopping
Ice Cream
Morgenstern's Finest Ice Cream worked with Russ & Daughters for its new sesame bagel ice cream sandwich, five-layer halvah ice cream bar and a chocolate babka pop. They're sold at Morgensterns and Russ & Daughters stores and for shipping nationwide from morgentsternsnyc.com. Free ice cream will be scooped Saturday from 1 to 3 p.m. at the Arts Center at Governors Island run by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council (L.M.C.C.). Inspired by her residency on the island, Elizabeth Smolarz, a conceptual artist, has created the flavors: lavender, chestnut, rocky road with almonds, and Greek yogurt with pistachio.
Michelin Guides
The Michelin guides have just added some restaurants to their New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C., listings. In New York the newcomers are Café Carmellini, Coqodaq, Corima, Four Twenty Five, Foxface Natural, Kanyakumari, Tolo, and in Long Island City, Vert Frais. Chicago now includes Cariño, John's Food and Wine, Maxwells Trading, Sifr, Taqueria Chignón and Warlord. Washington, D.C., additions are Almeda, Balos Estiatorio, Mita, Moon Rabbit, and Omakase at Barracks Row.

Full text: COMPANIES
CVS Health Cuts Outlook Below Wall St. Forecast
CVS Health missed first-quarter expectations and chopped its 2024 outlook more than a dollar below Wall Street's forecast.
Shares of the health care giant plunged Wednesday after the company said it was struggling with rising costs from care use in its Medicare Advantage business.
The company told analysts they were still dealing with rising use from outpatient care and in supplemental benefits. The company also saw some new pressure from inpatient care.
CEO Karen Lynch said the company's visibility into trends during the quarter was impaired by the cyberattack on Change Healthcare, which is operated by rival UnitedHealth Group. Change provides technology used to submit and process insurance claims for several insurers.
CVS Health had already scaled back 2024 expectations earlier this year as it worked to understand why costs from Medicare Advantage. ASSOCIATED PRESS
FOOD
Yum Brand Shares Hurt
By Uneven Demand
Yum Brands reported a fall in quarterly global same-store sales on Wednesday, hurt by choppy demand for its KFC and Pizza Hut brands from inflation-weary consumers in the United States as well as in overseas markets.
Consumers in the United States are increasingly looking for value-oriented meals in the face of sticky inflation, pushing fast food chains to double down on promotions and offers and on revamping their store and order experiences.
Shares of Yum Brands fell 3 percent after the Pizza Hut parent joined coffee giant Starbucks in recording its first drop in total same-store sales in about three years.
The company's quarterly results also echo that of burger giant McDonald's, which missed profit estimates for the first time in two years as consumers with constrained discretionary budgets hunt for better bargains while dining out. REUTERS
CREDIT CARDS
Mastercard Profits
Rise Above Expectations
Mastercard reported first-quarter profit that exceeded Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, on higher card spending by consumers despite rising borrowing costs and persistent inflation.
Wage growth and a tight labor market have ensured job security for card users, allowing them to spend without restraint even as the Federal Reserve keeps monetary policy tight.
The payments processor earned $ 3.31 per share on an adjusted basis, beating estimates of $ 3.24 a share, according to LSEG data.
Travel trends in Asia Pacific, which lifted pandemic curbs later than the rest of the world, continued to be a drag due to tougher comparisons from last year.
Mastercard's shares dipped 0.6 percent as the company's cross-border spending volumes for the first four weeks of April slowed, but it said that was tied to the timing of Easter. REUTERS

Sports Leagues Embraced Gambling. Now They're Facing the Risks of That Bet.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A string of gambling situations involving athletes leaves leagues in a tough spot.
Major League Baseball held its season openers this week under the shadow of a gambling scandal. Reports surfaced that the National Basketball Association is investigating a player over irregular bets. And college basketball fans await results from a review into unusual betting on a men's basketball game.
The incidents have highlighted a trade-off that professional sports leagues made when they embraced gambling.
Leagues have signed lucrative marketing deals with betting apps like FanDuel and DraftKings and use gambling to amp up fan engagement. But this new source of revenue has also opened the doors to a fundamental danger: that an explosion of sports betting could threaten the assumption of fairness at the core of athletic competitions.
"The risk is that the game becomes like professional wrestling -- which is rigged. And nobody bets on professional wrestling," said Fay Vincent, the M.L.B. commissioner from 1989 to 1992. "And if baseball becomes professional entertainment the way wrestling is, it's dead."
Leagues are unlikely to abandon gambling completely. But is there a way for them to protect their image as they profit from betting?
Clubs can no longer blame gambling itself for scandals. When Pete Rose was barred from baseball in 1989 for betting on games, in one of the most famous gambling scandals in sports history, Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti, Vincent's predecessor, denounced gambling as corrosive. But after a 2018 Supreme Court decision paved the way for states to legalize betting, leagues are now working directly with sports books. The N.B.A. signed an estimated $ 25 million contract with MGM Resorts in 2018, and M.L.B. has an exclusive multiyear deal with FanDuel.
"There is no putting the toothpaste back in the tube," said Patrick Rishe, a professor in the business of sports at Washington University in St. Louis. "The money flows too thick."
Leagues may support limits on prop bets, which allow gamblers to bet beyond the results of games on components like the first player to score. Since the outcome of these bets can often be decided by only one player, they leave individual athletes vulnerable to more pressure from bookies and others. The president of the N.C.A.A., Charlie Baker, encouraged states this week to ban prop bets, sending shares of DraftKings and FanDuel's parent company, Flutter, tumbling. (Some analysts said a ban would only minimally affect the sports books' bottom lines.)
Better self-monitoring could help. The largest U.S. sports books announced this week that they were forming the Responsible Online Gaming Association, an organization that will allow them to share information about customers who have been excluded because of problematic gambling.
"This is real money, real participation," said Chris Grove, an analyst at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming. "But, with that said, it shouldn't also just be a free pat on the back. There are a lot of questions, especially around what kind of information are you going to be sharing about individual players and then what kinds of actions are you going to be taking based on that information sharing."
Leagues could also extend bans against in-sport betting to individuals with ties to players, like personal assistants. Anyone who works at the teams "should probably be subjected to the same rules as they're subjecting the athletes to," said Jeffrey Kessler, a sports law lawyer at Winston & Strawn.
More taxes may be on the table. "State governments are also major beneficiaries of regulated gambling," Grove said. "They have an obligation to step up and to help to mitigate whatever problems are emerging."
States could raise taxes on sports betting, which range from 6.75 percent in Iowa to 51 percent in New York, Rhode Island and New Hampshire, and use the proceeds to fund oversight initiatives such as real-time data monitoring or state-supported teletherapy for gambling addicts.
A flat tax increase might be welcomed by FanDuel and DraftKings, the largest betting sites, which are better equipped than smaller rivals to afford the impact -- "though they would never say that out loud," Grove said.
But many are doubtful this will happen any time soon, given the pushback that higher taxes would most likely elicit from others. Professional sports teams and casinos both "have a very strong track record in terms of lobbying state legislatures," said Marc Edelman, a professor of law at Baruch College who studies gambling history.
Will the latest incidents damage leagues? Given the lengthy nature of TV contracts and relative steadfastness of fans, any immediate impact may be subtle. Attendance at Cincinnati Reds games dipped only slightly after Rose, who managed the team, was ousted for betting, said Keith O'Brien, author of "Charlie Hustle: The Rise and Fall of Pete Rose." A year later, it jumped about 25 percent.
"Does that mean that fans wanted to come because they were washing away the scandal? I don't know," O'Brien said. "I can tell you, having lived in Cincinnati in 1989, that it ruined baseball. It ruined it. And it was a lost season." -- Lauren Hirsch
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Jay Powell says economic resilience gives the Federal Reserve more flexibility on when to start cutting rates. The Fed chair signaled yesterday that robust consumer spending and a strong labor market allowed the central bank to be patient. He reiterated that it wanted to be more confident that inflation was coming down sustainably before taking action.
Sam Bankman-Fried is sentenced to 25 years in prison. The FTX founder was convicted of stealing $ 8 billion from his customers and faced a maximum sentence of 110 years. He vowed to appeal the conviction.
Visa and Mastercard agreed to reduce swipe fees for five years. The proposed class-action settlement to a long-running fight with retailers could have wider consequences, like making the credit card reward programs that many travelers use for free travel less lucrative.
Disney ended its legal fight with Ron DeSantis. The entertainment giant and the Florida governor have been sparring for two years over control of a tax district that encompasses Walt Disney World. Both sides have now agreed to cooperate on new growth plans for the 25,000-acre area.
Blockbuster spending
Wednesday is the deadline for Disney shareholders to vote in what is expected to be the most expensive proxy fight in history. The company's board faces attacks from two sets of activist investors -- Trian Partners and Blackwells Capital -- and all sides are putting their money to work to try to win over retail investors. Trian has spent about $ 25 million, Blackwells Capital about $ 6 million and Disney upward of $ 40 million.
Because a large portion of Disney's shareholders are retail investors, the battle has morphed into what is effectively a modern-day marketing campaign. And if you've been searching for information about the fight, you've probably been barraged by online ads. Here's how the price to bid on Google Ads keywords tied to the fight has jumped over the past year.
How any business can use A.I.
Ethan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, has built a big following for his research into how to apply artificial intelligence at work and his popular newsletter, One Useful Thing.
He spoke to DealBook about his new book, "Co-Intelligence: Living and Working With AI," in which he spells out how to get the most out of the transformative new tools. The conversation has been edited and condensed.
What mistakes do companies make with A.I.?
They tend to view this as something that has to be highly centralized. So it ends up being some sort of high-end working group, usually with the I.T. department and the legal department, to define rules and uses. What they often do is lock down use.
Companies also believe that somebody has answers about how to use A.I. They're hiring consulting companies, and the consulting companies don't know anything. Even the A.I. companies don't know how this can be used best.
Have you seen companies use generative A.I. to make big improvements in how they work?
What's really happening is large numbers of their employees are secretly doing their work with A.I. and just not telling anyone. So a lot of companies are actually being automated and getting huge efficiency gains.
You write that we should strive to use A.I. like a "cyborg" instead of a "centaur." What do you mean?
Centaur work is divided. There's some work you give the A.I and some work you keep for yourself. So let's say I'm not a good writer but I'm good at analysis. I'd say to the A.I.: "You do the writing. I do the analysis."
Cyborg work is more blended. When I wrote this book, if I got stuck on a sentence I'd ask the A.I., "Give me 10 ways of resolving this issue." I had it read through part of my books and give me feedback on it, or suggest analogies that might be useful. That is more effective.
If an executive wants to incorporate A.I. into my business, what should be that person's first step?
You just have to use it. The first use case I see from many, many people is using a chatbot to write children's stories or wedding toasts. I think the thing to actually start with is everything you legally, ethically can at work. Ask it questions about what you're working on. Have it brainstorm ideas with you. Have it give you feedback on a meeting that you recorded on Zoom with permission. And that's how you learn how to work with it.
On our radar: The ancient maritime principle of 'general average'
Insured losses from the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which a cargo ship struck on Tuesday, could reach $ 4 billion, and sorting out who will foot that bill may take a decade of litigation. Part of that fight may involve a little-known ancient principle of maritime law called "general average."
The principle, attributed to the mariners of Rhodes in a text from 533, dictates that when there is disaster, cargo shippers and vessel owners jointly share the costs. "General average is a shared sacrifice," said William Fennell, chair of the Marine Insurance and General Average Committee for the Maritime Law Association of the United States. The principle dictates that "everyone's in it together."
Classic cases involved jettisoning cargo -- if the crew had to lighten a ship's load to avoid sinking and tossed some but not all cargo, under general average everyone chipped in for the loss. In modern times, the notion applies more broadly, and it could arise in the case of this week's tragedy, Fennell said.
If the ship's owners invoke the principle and are not ultimately found to be at fault for the accident (in which case it would not apply), companies that had cargo on the ship could end up paying for some of those losses.
Thanks for reading! We'll see you Monday.

Full text: After working on the earliest version of the internet, he saw its potential and founded a conference on computer networking equipment.
Daniel C. Lynch, a computer network engineer whose exhibitions on networking equipment helped accelerate the commercialization of the internet in the 1980s and '90s, died on Saturday at his home in St. Helena, Calif. He was 82.
His death was confirmed by his daughter Julie Lynch-Sasson, who said he had been suffering from kidney failure.
In the mid-1980s, when the internet was still the domain of academia and the government, Mr. Lynch was a computer facility manager who played a key role in the early years of data networking. Although the internet was very small and restricted to noncommercial use, Mr. Lynch was convinced of its ultimate commercial potential.
Friends of his had recently started companies including Cisco Systems and Sun Microsystems. "And I'm going, Wait a minute, I can do this, too," he said in a video recorded for his induction into the Internet Hall of Fame in 2019.
In 1986, Mr. Lynch decided to hold a workshop to train vendors and developers to configure equipment for routing traffic through the internet. The point was to make different manufacturers' equipment work together and demonstrate the uses the internet could have for businesses. The first event, attended by 300 vendors, was run largely by volunteers, who snaked cable through the room and programmed specialized computers called routers, which were just becoming commercially available, to communicate with one another.
"His brainstorm was that you couldn't be there unless you were willing to interconnect with everyone else," said Vinton G. Cerf, a vice president and chief internet evangelist at Google. Mr. Lynch required the attendees to adhere to TCP/IP, a language spoken by computers connected to the internet that was quickly becoming the industry standard.
Mr. Lynch started calling his event Interop in the late 1980s. Within a decade, it had become one of the world's largest computer exhibitions, helping to create a global community of specialists capable of supporting a networking standard that made it possible for all the world's computers to share data. One computer industry analyst called it "the plumbing exhibition for the information age."
Interop also published ConneXions, a monthly technical journal focused on data networking. Today's market for internet-related equipment is estimated at $ 30 billion.
"He was essentially helping get the word out every way he could that the internet was not just a flash in the pan or just a research experiment, that it was a real thing, worthy of attention and investment," Dr. Cerf said. And he was right.
In 1991, Mr. Lynch sold Interop to Ziff Davis, a large publisher of computer magazines, for an estimated $ 25 million.
Daniel Courtney Lynch was born on Aug. 16, 1941, in Los Angeles. His father, Thomas Allen Lynch, was a public relations executive, and his mother, Irene Elizabeth (Courtney) Lynch, was an educator.
Mr. Lynch received his undergraduate degree in mathematics and philosophy from Loyola University (now Loyola Marymount University) in 1963. That year, he married Bernice Fijak, a recent graduate of Mount Saint Mary's College (now Mount Saint Mary's University) in Los Angeles. Two years later, he received his master's degree in mathematics from the University of California, Los Angeles.
In 1965, he entered the Air Force, and worked as a computer programmer at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico until 1969.
In 1973, Mr. Lynch was hired as a computer manager at Stanford Research Institute. The Arpanet, the precursor to the internet, was in its first years of operation, and the institute was the second node -- or point of connection -- on the nascent network.
Mr. Lynch moved to Los Angeles in 1980 to work at the University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute, another early Arpanet node, as a computer facility manager.
He left the institute in 1984 "because things were happening and I wanted to get involved in a startup of some kind," he said in the 2019 video. He financed the first networking-equipment workshop with a Mastercard, a Visa and a loan of $ 50,000.
After the sale of Interop, Mr. Lynch started a vineyard in Napa Valley, and in 1994, he co-founded CyberCash, an early internet-based payment service for electronic commerce. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2001.
Mr. Lynch's first marriage ended in divorce in 1976. In 1978, he married Georgia Sutherland; the marriage ended a year later. His third marriage, to Karen Dement in 1980, ended in divorce in 2003.
Beside his daughter Julie, Mr. Lynch is survived by five other children -- Christopher, Eric, Zachary, Katherine and Michael -- and seven grandchildren.

Full text: You may have received a discount for paying with cash, rather than a credit card, at a restaurant. A big reason is that credit card companies charge merchants a fee every time you tap, insert or swipe.
This past week, Visa and Mastercard agreed to cap those fees as part of a settlement stemming from a class-action lawsuit by merchants. The agreement could save merchants $ 30 billion over the next five years, potentially offering relief for smaller retailers and consumers who have been squeezed by rising costs.
But does that really mean you'll be paying less every time you use a credit card? There are reasons to be skeptical.
Swipe fees have increased over time. According to the Nilson Report, which tracks credit card payments, American merchants paid more than $ 70 billion in swipe fees for Visa and Mastercard payments last year.
"The settlement does nothing to actually bring competitive market forces to swipe fees or change the behavior of a cartel that centrally fixes rates and bars competition," said Christopher Jones, senior vice president of government relations at the National Grocers Association.
But Cassandra Happe, an analyst with WalletHub, said because the settlement allowed merchants to charge higher prices on transactions paid with certain credit cards, including those with rewards, some consumers could end up paying more.
"While it will help merchants save money, consumers may not see any significant savings, and they may even face higher fees for using rewards cards," Ms. Happe said.
Charging higher fees for certain cards further pits merchants against consumers, according to Doug Kantor, general counsel at the National Association of Convenience Stores.
"It makes merchants the bad guy in the eyes of the consumer, when it's really the credit card companies that are squeezing everyone when it comes to big fees," Mr. Kantor said.
"He knew it was wrong. He knew it was criminal."

Reduced Fees May Affect Loyalty Points: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A new agreement by Visa and Mastercard to reduce fees charged to merchants may drain the lucrative rewards that grant free travel to many credit card users.
On Tuesday, the largest credit card companies in the United States reached an agreement with merchants to reduce the so-called swipe fees retailers pay for accepting credit card payments, potentially saving the retailers $ 30 billion.
These fees also help fund the credit card rewards programs that many travelers redeem for things like free flights and hotel stays, leading points hawks to wonder: Are loyalty programs at risk?
Here's what we know so far about the changes.
What are the terms of the deal?
Last year, credit card payments generated an estimated $ 72 billion in fees paid by merchants, which are generally passed along to customers in the form of higher prices. For nearly 20 years, merchants have been seeking reductions in the fees they pay Visa and Mastercard for handling transactions where the cards are used.
The proposed settlement, awaiting approval in a federal court, reduces and caps those fees for five years. It would also allow merchants to potentially charge consumers more based on the card they pay with. For example, a person paying with a premium card like the Chase Sapphire Reserve, which costs $ 550 a year, could be charged more than someone paying with the more basic Chase Sapphire Preferred card, with an annual fee of $ 95.
Why does it matter?
The majority of the fees collected go back to the banks that issue the credit cards. Those banks have used the funds to push premium credit cards that offer loyalty points, which can be redeemed for free travel and other perks. The cards with the biggest benefits tend to be those that charge higher swipe fees.
While the reduction in the fees collected sounds small -- averaging at least .07 percent -- they represent an estimated $ 30 billion over the five-year term of the deal, which banks could try to make up by reducing points perks.
"It's reasonable to think that," said Brian Kelly, the founder of the Points Guy, a news site devoted to maximizing credit card points.
While he speculated that banks will be able to "find other ways to make up the difference," he acknowledged that a points squeeze could emerge.
"Opportunities to earn probably aren't going to flourish," he said.
The idea that merchants could charge more to the holders of premium, perks-rich cards, which are expensive, might also deter consumers from using them. Some experts question the viability of the practice given the potential for consumer backlash.
Is the new agreement related to the Credit Card Competition Act?
The legal actions that led to the new credit card agreement date back to 2005. But the newer Credit Card Competition Act, proposed in 2023, aims to introduce more competition in the credit card payment system. By creating a cheaper alternative pipeline for processing payments, the proposed legislation is seen as a greater threat to rewards programs.
Responding to the just-announced agreement between the credit card companies and retailers, Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and the lead sponsor of the Credit Card Competition Act, released a statement urging the act's passage.
"I fear that this deal only provides temporary concessions negotiated by a few lawyers behind closed doors," he said in the statement.
Other experts said the agreement may ease the pressure on Congress to pass the act.
"I think it's a way for Visa and Mastercard to show that they are making a good-faith effort to help out merchants by lowering the fees they've been complaining about for 20 years, and hopefully enough to let senators know they're doing their part," said Chris Hassan, the social media and brand manager for Upgraded Points, a website that tracks credit card benefits.
Separately, the proposed merger between Capital One and Discover, which is pending federal approval, could introduce more competition among credit cards and potentially improve rewards for holders of those cards.
What should I do now?
The points and payments systems won't change until the agreement is approved, which is expected in late 2024 or early 2025, according to a news release from Mastercard.
But the topic should remind travelers of the reality of playing with points: The rules always change. Values tend to fall as redemption levels rise, which companies issuing these currencies are free to adjust at will.
If you have points, spend them, say experts like Sara Rathner, a travel and credit card specialist at the financial website NerdWallet. "They're not a trophy to dust and admire."

Visa and Mastercard Agree To Put a Cap on Swipe Fees: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The deal could save merchants $ 30 billion over five years. It would also allow them to adjust prices based on the costs of accepting different credit cards.
Visa and Mastercard have agreed to cap the so-called swipe fees they charge to merchants that accept their credit cards, as part of a class-action settlement that could save merchants an estimated $ 30 billion over five years -- the latest development in a nearly 20-year legal battle.
Each time a customer uses one of its credit cards, Visa or Mastercard collects a swipe fee -- also called an interchange fee -- for processing the transaction, which it shares with banks issuing the cards. The merchants pass those fees along to customers, a practice that effectively inflates prices (and may motivate discounts given to customers paying with cash).
The settlement, which was announced on Tuesday and is subject to court approval, can be traced back to a 2005 lawsuit by merchants arguing that they paid excessive fees to accept Visa and Mastercard credit cards.
As more consumer spending has shifted to credit cards over the years, processing fees have also risen. To accept Visa and Mastercard, U.S. merchants paid $ 101 billion in total fees in 2023, including $ 72 billion in interchange fees, according to the Nilson Report, which tracks the payments industry. The fees also generate profits for big banks that issue the cards, and indirectly pay for credit card rewards programs, which aren't expected to be affected by the settlement deal.
In addition to putting a ceiling on the swipe fees -- an average of 2.26 percent of the transaction, according to Nilson -- Visa and Mastercard agreed to roll back the posted swipe fee of every merchant by at least 0.04 percentage points for at least three years. For five years, the companies will not raise the fees above the posted rates at the end of last year. Systemwide, the average fee must be at least 0.07 percentage points below the current average rate, a calculation that an independent auditor will verify.
Merchants will also be permitted to adjust their prices based on the costs associated with accepting different cards, while letting customers know why some cards -- typically business cards and those with more rewards and perks -- cost more than others.
"This settlement achieves our goal of eliminating anticompetitive restraints and providing immediate and meaningful savings to all U.S. merchants, small and large," Robert Eisler, co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said in a statement.
But not all merchants, particularly smaller ones, are as optimistic about the proposed changes. Temporary fee reductions fall short of what's needed and underscore why Congress needs to pass legislation to promote a more competitive marketplace, said the Merchants Payments Coalition, a trade group representing retailers, supermarkets, convenience stores, gas stations and online merchants.
"The settlement does nothing to actually bring competitive market forces to swipe fees or change the behavior of a cartel that centrally fixes rates and bars competition," said Christopher Jones, a member of the coalition's executive committee and senior vice president of government relations at the National Grocers Association. "Instead, it tries to provide token, temporary relief and then allows the card companies to raise rates yet again."
Senator Richard J. Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois who has long fought to keep interchange fees in check, introduced bipartisan legislation in June that would require big banks issuing credit cards to enable the cards to be processed on at least one other network besides Visa or Mastercard, in an effort to create more options for merchants beyond the two industry heavyweights.
Doug Kantor, general counsel at the National Association of Convenience Stores, said the settlement provisions that would allow merchants to charge more for credit cards that carried higher fees will be complicated to carry out and pitted the merchants against their customers.
"Even if they do use them, it makes the merchants the tax collector for the charges -- and it makes merchants the bad guy in the eyes of the consumer, when it's really the credit card companies that are squeezing everyone when it comes to big fees," Mr. Kantor added.
Neither Visa nor Mastercard admitted to any wrongdoing.
In a statement, Mastercard's chief legal officer and general counsel, Rob Beard, said the agreement "brings closure to a longstanding dispute by delivering substantial certainty and value to business owners, including flexibility in how they manage acceptance of card programs."
Separately, Kim Lawrence, Visa's president, North America, said the company had "reached a settlement with meaningful concessions that address true pain points small businesses have identified."
Ron Shevlin, chief research officer at Cornerstone Advisors, a bank consultancy, said the most meaningful part of the deal might be the ability of smaller merchants to band together to negotiate fees as large groups.
"This is where the door has opened," he added, "to something they haven't had the power to do."

The Capital One-Discover Deal Won't Fix Our Broken Credit Card System: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A fight has commenced over Capital One's effort to acquire Discover, a deal that would birth an enormous credit card company rivaling Visa, Mastercard and American Express. The resulting competition could, in the short run, lower some costs to businesses and consumers. However, over the longer term, the merger would keep intact the broken and predatory system in which credit card companies profit handsomely by rewarding our richest Americans and advantaging the biggest corporations.
Credit card companies increasingly generate money via swipe fees, or the money merchants pay issuers every time a credit card is used. Total swipe fees rose 20 percent in 2022 to an estimated $ 160 billion a year nationally. The pandemic changed how we buy things, significantly increasing the share of transactions put on credit cards rather than conducted in cash, adding to the swipe fees merchants pay.
On top of this, a 2018 Supreme Court ruling effectively forces merchants to accept either every type of card -- from, say, a basic Green Card to the Platinum Card -- from an issuer like Amex or none of them. And even though fancier types of cards generally demand higher swipe fees, the ruling also barred merchants from incentivizing consumers to use the cheaper ones. These facts combine in a way that makes it even more appealing for Capital One, a giant credit card issuer, to merge with Discover, which owns a payment system, and generate greater profits from credit cards, particularly higher-end reward cards.
Credit card companies found they could command ever-greater swipe fees from merchants while at the same time offering their wealthiest consumers more deluxe credit cards that reward big spending with cash back, travel points, access to fancy airport lounges and the like -- and then pass on the cost of those rewards to merchants. Merchants must then choose whether to accept and pay the higher swipe fee demanded by these platinum expensive cards or not take any from that card company. In our increasingly digital economy, most merchants have little alternative but to accept the pricey versions and to pay for the privilege. Naturally, merchants pass on their increased cost to all of their customers.
That's how the rest of us, whether we pay with cash, a debit card or a middle-of-the-road credit card, wind up paying more -- because we are subsidizing these rewards cards for whom only the wealthiest qualify. One study from economists at the Boston Federal Reserve estimated that the highest-income households profit over $ 1,000 a year tax-free from the payment system, adjusted for inflation.
Because swipe fees include a fixed cost in addition to a percentage of the total cost, small-dollar transactions are extremely expensive for merchants. My research found huge costs for such transactions as buying a cup of coffee or paying for a bus or subway ride. One year my oldest friend's small coffee shop paid more in card processing costs than for coffee beans.
Big companies can leverage their resources to lower swipe fees, giving them a leg up. Starbucks stole a page from the credit card playbook and built an app that gives consumers rewards on future purchases if they upload larger amounts of money from their credit cards, thus lowering the total fees Starbucks has to pay the credit card companies for each swipe.
Some big businesses negotiate discounted swipe fees. Costco is the most aggressive; there have been reports that the big discount retailer's contract with Citibank and Visa lowered its costs to 0.4 percent while a local dry cleaner may be paying closer to 3 percent.
The problem isn't limited to nonwealthy consumers and small businesses: Parking meters that used to run on coins now rely on credit-card-powered apps, which charge transaction fees that can be over 20 percent, such as 45 cents on $ 2. Public transit agencies can lose 7 percent of the money they generate in fares in card-processing fees. A growing gap between what users pay and local agencies receive could stress budgets and require higher taxes, increased fees or reduced public services.
To fix the problem, Congress should legislatively correct the Supreme Court's mistake. For starters, give merchants the power to reject the priciest credit cards, and let's see if their users are willing to pay the true cost of their rewards. This solution ought to have some bipartisan support; the idea was strong enough politically to be supported by states as diverse as Ohio, Texas and Maryland. Bipartisan legislation to overturn a conservative Supreme Court ruling may sound like a pipe dream, but in payments policy we've seen a few examples such as the Durbin Amendment to what became the Dodd-Frank Act, which lowered debit interchange fees, received 64 votes (including 16 from Republicans) in the Senate and made it into law.
Second, brave policymakers could start taxing reward points. The richer you are, the more likely you qualify for bigger rewards. Progressive taxation rates mean that exempting rewards from taxation makes them nearly four times as valuable to those in the top tax bracket as the bottom. Why is interest from my savings account taxed, but the cash back from card spending not? Once upon a time the value of frequent flier miles was hard to quantify; now the Points Guy has it down.
Finally, we could require all merchants have access to the same swipe-fee pricing, regardless of size. Why should the payment system give big business another advantage? The electronic cash register should not tilt the playing field.
Our payment system's problems will not be solved by allowing or stopping a combination of Capital One and Discover. Adding a fourth major issuer to compete with the big three will make little difference if the system's rules remain the same. Capital One already seems to be competing with American Express for wealthy customers who like elite airport lounges and big travel perks, which are funded in part from higher swipe fees. The rewards have kept getting richer over the past 20 years. Simply adding one more company to earn large profits through the existing system will hardly stop it.
Blocking the merger will fail to change the payment system that continues to drive greater rewards to those with the most money already, paid for by merchants and consumers who use cash, debit or lower-tier cards because they are not rich enough to qualify. As the economy continues to digitize with more micropayments, the credit card burden will keep growing, particularly on smaller businesses. Today's large banks and payment companies will make more profit, sharing it based on who qualifies for elite status.
Until legislators are willing to change a system that showers tax-free rewards on the upper middle class, the cash register will continue to exacerbate the wealth gap and help big business get even bigger. It may feel great to stand up against a merger and fight those "big banks" -- while enjoying a "free meal" at an exclusive airport lounge before taking a vacation using frequent flier miles. But if victory is more of the status quo, then the biggest losers will be those the government should protect the most.

Full text: Before two of the largest credit card companies in the United States can complete a $ 35 billion deal, they'll face an uphill battle with regulators.
Capital One announced on Monday that it would acquire Discover Financial Services, in a deal to combine two of the largest credit card companies in the United States. But before the transaction can be consummated, the deal must overcome regulatory scrutiny.
Here's what you need to know about Capital One and Discover's potential megadeal, and what it could mean for consumers.
Why now?
The deal, valued at more than $ 35 billion, would give Capital One access to a credit card network of more than 300 million cardholders, adding to its existing customer base of 100 million.
Richard D. Fairbank, the chief executive of Capital One, said on a call with analysts Tuesday morning that the deal would help the combined enterprise "compete more effectively against some of the largest banks and payments companies in the United States."
Capital One was the nation's fourth-largest credit card issuer last year, with $ 122.9 billion in outstanding receivable payments, and Discover was the nation's sixth largest with $ 94 billion, according to data from Nilson Report, a newsletter that tracks the payment industry. The merger would place the two companies above last year's largest issuer, JPMorgan Chase, which had $ 191.4 billion in credit card loans.
Credit card debt in the United States has soared, particularly as Americans try to cover rising expenses as a result of high inflation, and more vendors are shifting away from using cash. Capital One issues cards on networks run by Visa and Mastercard, and acquiring Discover would help it expand its payment operations.
The transaction is likely to draw scrutiny from regulators who are concerned that megadeals would give larger financial institutions even more power to set higher rates, said David Robertson, the publisher of the Nilson Report.
Will regulators approve it?
The two companies cannot merge without getting a sign-off from bank regulators, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. Some big deals go through without a hitch, but recent developments in the Biden administration's approach to mergers suggest that Capital One and Discover might face real hurdles. The biggest question regulators will consider is whether the combined company will have too much influence over the pricing and availability of services in the market in which it operates.
Antitrust officials have kept a close eye on online payments providers. In 2020, the Justice Department sued to block a $ 5.3 billion merger between Visa and Plaid; the companies abandoned their plans soon after.
After approving a flurry of deals over the past year to try to tamp down a crisis among midsize banks, financial regulators have already signaled a desire to be more selective about the mergers they approve. Last month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator overseeing the country's largest banks, proposed changes to its review process for evaluating bank mergers. If adopted, the changes would end the process of granting approval by default after a certain period has passed since the merger was proposed, giving regulators more time to scrutinize each proposed transaction.
The Bank Policy Institute, a trade group, denounced the proposal as a "lengthy, opaque and uncertain supervisory review process that discourages banks from even contemplating a potential merger in the first place," while community groups hailed it as a necessary effort to bring more transparency and consideration to the process.
Jesse Van Tol, chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a group that works with banks to meet community needs and that opposes the merger, said, "Historically, the consolidation of the industry has not led to better prices for consumers." Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, has called on regulators to kill the deal.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau published a report last week that found larger issuers, like Capital One, charged higher annual rates than their smaller counterparts, like regional banks and credit unions, which the agency said was fueled by a lack of competition in the industry.
What does this mean for Discover cardholders?
Account holders do not have to worry about any changes happening just yet: Regulators still have to sign off on the merger, as do shareholders of each company.
Mr. Fairbank said on a call with investors that the deal was expected to be completed in late 2024 or early 2025.
"We're a long way from knowing, and an even longer way from actually seeing, how cardholder terms may change," said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at BankRate, a financial services company.
One question that is likely to be on regulators' minds is what Capital One chooses to do with the Discover brand.
Mr. Robertson said that the deal was unlikely to change much for existing Discover users and that regulatory action to stop the transaction would do little to change market concentration.
"If regulators wanted to do something, they should have acted years and years ago to create more competition," Mr. Robertson said.

Capital One Will Acquire Discover for $35.3 Billion: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The all-stock deal, which is valued at $ 35.3 billion, will combine two of the largest credit card companies in the United States.
Capital One announced on Monday that it would acquire Discover Financial Services in an all-stock transaction valued at $ 35.3 billion, a deal that would merge two of the largest credit card companies in the United States.
"A space that is already dominated by a relatively small number of megaplayers is about to get a little smaller," said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree.
Capital One, with $ 479 billion in assets, is one of the nation's largest banks, and it issues credit cards on networks run by Visa and Mastercard. Acquiring Discover will give it access to a credit card network of 305 million cardholders, adding to its base of more than 100 million customers. The country's four major networks are American Express, Mastercard, Visa and Discover, which has far fewer cardholders than its competitors.
But consumer advocates pushed back on the possible deal, saying it posed antitrust concerns. "It is very difficult to imagine how federal regulators could allow Capital One to buy Discover given the requirement that mergers benefit the public as well as insiders," Jesse Van Tol, the chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, said in a statement.
The acquisition by Capital One will be one of the first tests of regulatory scrutiny on bank deals since the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said last month that it intended to slow down approvals for mergers and acquisitions.
"It's hard to know which way it would go, but there will certainly be a lot of attention paid to this deal because of the money and magnitude of the companies involved," said Mr. Schulz.
Complicating the landscape is the fact that other deals in the financial industry have come under renewed scrutiny, said David Schiff, a senior partner at West Monroe, a digital services consulting firm. These include New York Community Bank's acquisition of billions of assets from Signature Bank during the regional banking crisis last year.

New York Community Bank recently reported a sizable loss for its most recent quarter, and said it would set aside more capital to act as a buffer against future problems. Much of its troubles stem from the weakening commercial real estate market, but Mr. Schiff said that politicians could point to the deal as an example of one that regulators were too quick to approve.
As part of the acquisition, Capital One will pay Discover shareholders a 26 percent premium based on the company's closing stock price on Friday. At the close of the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval and is expected in late 2024 or early 2025, Capital One shareholders will own approximately 60 percent of the combined company and Discover shareholders will own the rest.
Discover was valued at about $ 28 billion when the market closed on Friday, and Capital One was valued at about $ 52 billion.
The deal is part of Capital One's strategy to build a global payments network, helping it work directly with merchants and small businesses. And it gives Discover greater scale to compete with other credit card companies. Capital One said the agreement would generate $ 2.7 billion in pretax savings.
"Our acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity to bring together two very successful companies with complementary capabilities and franchises, and to build a payments network that can compete with the largest payments networks and payments companies," Richard Fairbank, founder, chairman and chief executive of Capital One, said in the statement.
In June, Capital One acquired Velocity Black, a digital concierge company that brings together travel, entertainment, shopping and dining offerings for consumers.
Discover is emerging from a period of turbulence. The company's former chief executive, Roger Hochschild, stepped down in August amid a regulatory review of incorrectly classified credit accounts. In October, the company said it was taking steps to improve its corporate governance, and in December, it announced its new chief executive, Michael G. Rhodes. The company's profit in the fourth quarter of 2023 fell 62 percent from the same period the year before.
The once-giant retailer Sears introduced the Discover card in 1985. Discover later became a part of Morgan Stanley before the investment bank spun it out through an initial public offering of stock in 2007.
Given Discover's recent challenges, the question is whether "regulators view this as a white knight coming in to help fix a troubled player in the market or whether they view this as a limitation of competition -- and therefore something to avoid," Mr. Schiff said.

New York Law Demanding Clarity in Card Surcharges: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The state law, which goes into effect Sunday, requires businesses to include any surcharges in the prices listed for the products or services they sell.
A new law going into effect on Sunday will require businesses in New York to clearly post the cost of purchasing items with a credit card, including any surcharges being imposed, for customers before checkout.
The law, signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul in December, also prevents businesses from imposing more in credit card surcharges than what they are charged by processing companies.
Businesses can choose either to solely display the higher credit card price for the products or services they sell or to list both the credit card price and the lower cash price for the items.
The new disclosure requirements will "ensure individuals can trust that their purchases will not result in surprise surcharges," Ms. Hochul said in a statement this week.
"Transparency is crucial in building trust between businesses and communities, and now patrons will be empowered to budget accordingly," she said.
In New Jersey, Gov. Philip D. Murphy signed a similar law last year requiring merchants to notify consumers before checkout about the amount of any credit card surcharges to be applied. It also prohibited merchants from charging consumers more than the processing fee the businesses paid.
A national law prohibiting merchants from charging consumers extra for credit card purchases expired four decades ago. Since then, many businesses have come to rely on so-called convenience fees as a way to offset what they are charged by credit card processing companies.
Jeremy Cooney, a state senator, said in a statement that the law requiring the disclosure "helps consumers better understand the total cost" of the products they buy.
However, businesses were already required -- by the state and by companies like Visa and Mastercard -- to display credit card surcharge amounts at the entrances of their stores and at the point of sale, said Youssef Mubarez, the director of public relations for the Yemeni American Merchants Association.
"They're making the merchants look like the enemies by calling it 'hidden fees' when they're not," Mr. Mubarez said. "The only thing they're trying to do is save money so they can keep their business alive."
Mr. Mubarez, whose family has owned a deli in Times Square for decades and who is the owner of a point of sale and service company, said that limiting the surcharge amount to be in line with processing fees is a good idea.
However, he said that the new regulations on displaying prices would add work to already stressed small-business owners. In recent weeks, Mr. Mubarez said he had to send his employees to help clients re-price items using a price gun that can print the different cash and credit amounts for purchases.
In addition, some of the rules from the state -- such as that it is now illegal to simply put a sign at the register notifying consumers about the blanket surcharge applied to all products -- is at odds with the guidelines from credit card processing companies, he said, confusing some of the merchants with whom he works.
"They make these laws thinking of the bigger businesses and just leave the small businesses to go figure out what they have to do," he said.

Full text: The Korean Chinese restaurant Octo opens in Koreatown, Bibliotheque brings a book-lined wine den to Mercer Street and more restaurant news.
Headliner
Coqodaq
Beef or chicken? The restaurateur Simon Kim now has you covered either way. An owner of the Korean steakhouse Cote is opening what he calls a "fried chicken cathedral," with a dining room framed by glowing, barrel-vaulted arches that disappear to infinity, thanks to a rear wall mirror. The design is by the Rockwell Group, involving David Rockwell's personal touch. But the food is Mr. Kim's idea, more than four years in the making, with the executive chef Seung Kyu Kim in charge (no relation to the owner, though the two met while working at Jean-Georges). Simon Kim's notion is to offer a mix of American and Korean approaches to fried chicken and give it glamour with (supposedly) more sustainable ingredients in a more elegant setting. At Coqodaq it's one-size-fits-all, a $ 38 dinner that includes chicken soup; a bucket of chicken parts fried in a gluten-free batter based on rice flour, chicken glazed with gochujang or soy and garlic; a cold perilla noodle dish; banchan, small dishes, that include palate-cleansing white radish; and soft serve frozen yogurt. Starters (extra) include some seafood options. The chickens are pasture-raised in Pennsylvania Amish country, and triple-fried in oil produced in Iowa from fermented Brazilian sugar cane. The name of the restaurant blends French, American and Korean words for chicken. The sommelier, Victoria James, who also curates the wines at Cote, has a wine list that features Champagne, which she and Mr. Kim agree is the ideal beverage for fried chicken. Her list offers 400 of them, and other sparklers by the glass and the bottle. Considering that fried chicken is finger-food, in the front of the restaurant, there's a hand-washing area with three sinks. Some high-top tables near the entrance are for walk-ins, there's a long bar, and garage doors will open to an outside patio in warmer weather. Tables at the leather-upholstered booths beneath the arches in the 190-seat room have lazy susans, the better for sharing. (Opens Friday)

Opening
Octo
Steve and Christina Jang, the owners of the stalwart Koreatown barbecue restaurant New Wonjo, have made a sharp turn to something quite new: a Korean Chinese restaurant with a mixed menu as it might be interpreted in Seoul. The executive chef, Segun Song, has had years of experience in Chinese restaurants in South Korea, Australia, Singapore and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Peking duck is the showstopper, offered whole, half and even adorned with truffles and gold leaf ( $ 155), and as a sample on a set lunch menu ( $ 48). Seoul-style beef soup, cucumber-radish salad, mapo tofu rice bowl, hot garlic chicken, sesame dan dan noodles and several iterations of jajangmyeon, noodles in black bean sauce, are some other choices. The dining room is done in warm tones with rows of booths and tables.
1 East 33rd Street, 646-833-7864, octonyc.com.
Bibliotheque
The plastic surgeon, oenophile and bibliophile Andrew Jacono has created a showcase for his passions. In partnership with his son AJ Jacono, a writer, he is opening this comfortably plush book-lined den where the volumes are available to peruse or to purchase, and can be enjoyed with a glass or bottle from an astounding list. Bottles range from $ 58 for Bonny Doon orange wine to $ 13,450 for 2000 Château Pétrus, and include other Bordeaux, Super Tuscans and California cult cabernets; wines by the glass range from $ 15 to $ 240. There are suggestions in bookish categories like Romance, and, for oversize bottles, Epics. Best Sellers suggest books to pair with certain wines. Sandwiches, salads, cheese plates, caviar and pastries, all from Épicerie Boulud, are served. Art lines the walls that are not covered by bookshelves, and a full schedule of readings and other events with authors, movie screenings, tastings, karaoke and game nights are planned. (Wednesday)

Full text: While the pace of growth slowed, spending stayed strong because of robust job growth and strong wage gains.
Despite lingering inflation, Americans increased their spending this holiday season, early data shows. That comes as a big relief for retailers that had spent much of the year fearing the economy would soon weaken and consumer spending would fall.
Retail sales from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24 increased 3.1 percent from a year earlier, according to data from Mastercard SpendingPulse, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment. The numbers, released Tuesday, are not adjusted for inflation.
Spending increased across many categories, with restaurants experiencing one of the largest jumps, 7.8 percent. Apparel increased 2.4 percent, and groceries also had gains.
The holiday sales figures, driven by a healthy labor market and wage gains, suggest that the economy remains strong. The Federal Reserve's campaign to rein in high inflation by raising interest rates over the last few years has slowed the economy, but many economists believe a so-called soft landing is within reach.
"What we're seeing during this holiday season is very consistent with how we're thinking about the economy, which is that it's an economy that is still very much expanding," said Michelle Meyer, Mastercard's chief economist.
Solid job growth is allowing people to spend more. And even though consumer prices have risen a lot in the last two years, wages have grown faster on the whole.
"We're now entering the period, and we're seeing it to some extent during the holiday season, where consumers have built up real purchasing power," Ms. Meyer said.
Still, spending in categories like electronics and jewelry declined this season. And the rate of growth in spending has moderated from the last couple of years. In 2022, retail sales during the holiday season increased 5.4 percent, according to the National Retail Federation. In 2021, they rose 12.7 percent, the largest percentage increase in at least 20 years. Online sales growth has also slowed in 2023, increasing 6.3 percent compared with 10.6 percent from 2021 to 2022, according to Mastercard.
While the economy is strong overall, Americans are being more mindful of how they're spending, and that discretion shaped the shopping season.
Some retailers had expressed concerns in recent months that shoppers appeared glum and fearful about the economy. Walmart and Target noted that shoppers seemed to be waiting for sales before buying, a change from recent years, when they spent more freely.
"The caution that they've taken on their spend and where they're spending has been really noticeable in the second half of the year, where a lot of customers have been affected, especially lower-income and middle-income" people, said Jessica Ramírez, a retail research analyst at Jane Hali & Associates.
In a return to some of the trends that prevailed before the pandemic, many retailers and brands offered promotions. Discounts were in the 30 to 50 percent range, Ms. Ramírez said. But the discounts were more targeted this year than last because fewer companies were saddled with gluts of inventory.
The categories that have faced falling sales this year -- like electronics, home furnishings and toys -- saw some of the biggest discounts leading up to Christmas. Those goods had enjoyed booming sales during the pandemic.
Alexan Weir, a 30-year-old mother in Orlando, Fla., said she was pleased to find deals on toys when she bought Christmas gifts for her daughters this month. Among the items she bought at Target were the Asha doll, based on the main character from the Disney movie "Wish"; an Elsa doll from "Frozen"; and a Minnie Mouse kitchen set. With discounts, the items together cost about half as much as their total list prices of $ 200.
"As a parent you're just trying to make your kids happy. You're not trying to break the bank," Ms. Weir said. "I spent a little bit more this year, but at least with the few sales that I received, I can say I was not heartbroken about how much I was spending."
Barbie -- whose banner year was fueled by a blockbuster movie -- sold particularly well in a year when there wasn't a breakout toy. The doll and her many accouterments have been selling well at Mary Arnold Toys, a family-owned store on Manhattan's Upper East Side. And overall sales at the shop have been steady, said Ezra Ishayik, who has run the store for 40 years.
"It looks like it is about even with last year -- not better, not worse," Mr. Ishayik said. "The economy looks good to me. It's decent, it's OK, people are buying. We are on the high end of the industry, so we don't see any downtrend at all."
But the past few months have been more challenging for Modi Toys.
Modi, an online retailer, sells plush toys and books based on Hindu culture and usually sees two sales bumps in the fourth quarter -- one in the lead-up to Diwali and another around Christmas.
Normally the company brings in more than $ 100,000 in sales in the month before Diwali, which fell on Nov. 12, but this year sales dropped into the five-figure range. That was partly because the retailer launched a product too early and then had to offer hefty discounts to spur sales -- something retailers try to avoid with new merchandise.
"That's when we knew that we really were going to have a challenging holiday season," said Avani Modi Sarkar, a founder of the company.
As she wraps up the year and looks toward 2024, Ms. Sarkar is testing new digital marketing strategies, including sending personalized email newsletters to customers and closely monitoring discounts.
"We're just trying to close the gap for us and not end the year with as big of a gap as we would have," she said. "I know what we're capable of, and I'm trying to not only get to that level again, but surpass it."
One clear sign that shoppers are being more careful about how much they spend comes from discount retailers. In November, Burlington, an off-price retailer, and the parent company of Marshalls and T.J. Maxx said they saw comparable store sales increase 6 percent.
The online retailer ThriftBooks' holiday sales were also up from a year ago, by more than 20 percent in November and more than 24 percent this month, said Ken Goldstein, the company's chief executive.
"This was unprecedented," Mr. Goldstein said. "This is beyond belief in terms of the volume that we're doing. Because we're a value product, I think a lot of people are putting their dollars to work."

Season's Hottest Shopping Trend: Falling Prices: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: As inflation slows, prices for some physical goods are falling outright, which could lift consumers' spirits.
American shoppers, burned by more than two years of rapid inflation, are getting some welcome relief this holiday season: Prices on many products are falling.
Toys are almost 3 percent cheaper this Christmas than last, government data shows. Sports equipment is down nearly 2 percent. Bigger-ticket items are also showing price declines: Washing machines cost 12 percent less than a year ago, for example. And eggs, whose meteoric rise in prices last winter became a prime example of the country's inflation problem, are down 22 percent over the past year.
Consumer prices, in the aggregate, are still rising, though not nearly as quickly as a year ago. Most groceries still cost more than they did a year ago. So do most services, such as restaurant meals, haircuts and trips to the dentist. And housing costs, the biggest monthly expense for most Americans, are still rising for both renters and home buyers. Overall, the price of physical goods is flat over the past year, while the price of services is up a bit more than 5 percent.
Still, economists view the moderation in goods prices as an important step toward putting the high inflation of the past two and a half years more firmly in the rearview mirror. They expect it to continue: Most forecasters say prices for physical products will keep falling next year, especially prices for longer-lasting manufactured goods, where the recent declines have been largest. That should help price increases overall to ease.
"We're just kind of in the beginning of that phase, and we should continue to see downward pressure on prices in this category," said Michelle Meyer, chief economist for Mastercard.
For consumers, who have been dour about the economy despite low unemployment, falling prices on many goods could provide a psychological lift. After the rapid inflation of the past few years, a mere slowdown in price increases might not feel like much to celebrate. But seeing prices fall could be a different story -- especially because some of the biggest recent declines have been in categories that consumers tend to pay the most attention to, such as gasoline. (The price of regular gas, which topped $ 5 a gallon nationally in June 2022, has fallen to just over $ 3 on average, according to AAA.)
"People will key in on certain prices," said Neale Mahoney, a Stanford University economist who recently left a role in the Biden administration. "We know that people will overweight certain things."
The price of many goods soared in 2021, fed by a surge in demand from consumers flush with pandemic relief checks and by supply chain disruptions that limited supplies of many products, especially those from overseas.
Many economists initially expected a quick reversal, but instead prices kept rising. Supply chains took longer to return to normal than expected, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to a spike in energy prices in 2022. At the same time, consumer demand for goods remained high, and many companies took advantage of the opportunity to push through price increases and pad their profit margins.
Now, however, many of those forces are beginning to fade. Supply chains have largely returned to normal. Oil prices have fallen. Economic weakness in China and other countries has held down demand for many raw materials, which feeds through to consumer prices.
Softer demand from American consumers could also be playing a role. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates repeatedly since early last year in an effort to curb spending and control inflation. Consumers have so far proved remarkably resilient, but retailers in recent months have reported that shoppers have increasingly traded down to cheaper items or waited for sales before buying -- trends that could accelerate if the economy cools further next year.
"We think that the consumer is going to be looking for value, and that's because they are very sensitive to price," Carlos E. Alberini, chief executive of Guess, the fashion retailer, told investors last month. The company has "revisited some of the pricing structure we have in all brands," he added.
Some toy manufacturers and retailers that sell toys have also said they expect sales this season to be less robust than in years past and have leaned into advertising their products' affordability.
At many companies, price cuts have taken the form of Black Friday sales and holiday promotions that are larger for some categories of items than in past years. At Signet Jewelers, the big diamond retailer, sales fell in the third quarter, and the company recently said it expected sales to be lower this holiday season than last year in part because of "elevated promotional activity."
"It's been a different holiday season," Virginia C. Drosos, Signet's chief executive, told investors on a conference call this month. Instead of shopping early, customers are waiting to make their purchases and are looking for deals, she said.
Matt Pavich, senior director of innovation and strategy for Revionics, a company that uses artificial intelligence to help retailers set prices, said companies were trying to cut prices before their competitors did.
"As prices come down, there's going to be the race to bring prices down more, get the credit for that," he said. "We're going to see retailers really trying to win back consumers' trust."
Still, prices for most products remain well above where they were before the pandemic. A dozen eggs cost about 50 cents more than in February 2020. Used car prices, another prominent example of pandemic sticker shock, have fallen more than 10 percent from their peak early last year but are 37 percent above where they were in February 2020.
Services prices are still climbing more quickly than before the pandemic. Some economists say goods prices will need to fall further for overall inflation to return to the Federal Reserve's target of 2 percent a year.
"We need pretty substantial deflation, and I wouldn't call what we're seeing 'substantial,"' said Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project, an economic policy division of the Brookings Institution. "It's not even substantial in a historical context."
Indeed, prices of durable goods fell much of the two decades that preceded the pandemic. Long-term trends such as globalization and automation have tended to push down manufacturing costs. Intense competition among retailers, especially with the rise of online shopping, meant those savings were mostly passed on to consumers.
Services prices, on the other hand, rarely fall, in part because wages account for a much larger share of the cost of most services. During the decade before the pandemic, services prices gradually rose while goods prices were flat or fell, resulting in an extended period of stable, moderate inflation.
Economists don't expect to see outright deflation, in which prices fall for both goods and services. That's a good thing: Overall price declines are generally viewed as economically dangerous, if they last.
There are a few reasons. For starters, in theory, deflation could prompt consumers to hold off on spending, touching off a downward spiral. People may be unlikely to buy today what they expect to be cheaper tomorrow. Once deflation takes hold, it can be difficult to escape: Japan has been stuck in a deflationary pattern since the late 1990s.
"When demand in the economy is weak, the last thing you want is someone to say, 'I'm not going to buy that car today because it's going to be $ 600 less expensive in six months,"' said Karen Dynan, an economist at Harvard.
For another, companies are unlikely to raise wages in a world where they cannot charge more. And if wages are not going up -- or are even going down -- it will be harder for households to keep up with fixed bills, like mortgage interest payments.
But while broad-based price declines are a problem, most economists view the more limited declines happening now as a sign that the economy is gradually moving past the disruptions of the pandemic.
"Supply chains have basically normalized," said Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro. "Household demand behavior has basically normalized, the dollar is still pretty strong. I wouldn't see a reason why goods prices would go higher."

Now, however, many of those forces are beginning to fade. Supply chains have largely returned to normal. Oil prices have fallen. Economic weakness in China and other countries has held down demand for many raw materials, which feeds through to consumer prices.
Softer demand from American consumers could also be playing a role. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates repeatedly since early last year in an effort to curb spending and control inflation. Consumers have so far proved remarkably resilient, but retailers in recent months have reported that shoppers have increasingly traded down to cheaper items or waited for sales before buying — trends that could accelerate if the economy cools further next year.
“We think that the consumer is going to be looking for value, and that’s because they are very sensitive to price,” Carlos E. Alberini, CEO of Guess, the fashion retailer, told investors last month. The company has “revisited some of the pricing structure we have in all brands,” he added.
Some toy manufacturers and retailers that sell toys have also said they expect sales this season to be less robust than in years past and have leaned into advertising their products’ affordability.
At many companies, price cuts have taken the form of Black Friday sales and holiday promotions that are larger for some categories of items than in past years. At Signet Jewelers, a big diamond retailer, sales fell in the third quarter, and the company recently said that it expected sales to be lower this holiday season than last year in part because of “elevated promotional activity.”
“It’s been a different holiday season,” Virginia C. Drosos, Signet’s CEO, told investors on a conference call this month. Instead of shopping early, customers are waiting to make their purchases and are looking for deals, she said.
Matt Pavich, senior director of innovation and strategy for Revionics, a company that uses artificial intelligence to help retailers set prices, said companies were trying to cut prices before their competitors do.
“As prices come down, there’s going to be the race to bring prices down more, get the credit for that,” he said. “We’re going to see retailers really trying to win back consumers’ trust.”
Still, prices for most products remain well above where they were before the pandemic. A dozen eggs cost about 50 cents more than in February 2020. Used car prices, another prominent example of pandemic sticker shock, have fallen more than 10% from their peak early last year but are 37% above where they were in February 2020.
Services prices are still climbing more quickly than before the pandemic. Some economists say that goods prices will need to fall further for overall inflation to return to the Fed’s target of 2% a year.
“We need pretty substantial deflation, and I wouldn’t call what we’re seeing ‘substantial,’” said Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project, an economic policy division of the Brookings Institution. “It’s not even substantial in a historical context.”
Indeed, prices of durable goods fell much of the two decades that preceded the pandemic. Long-term trends such as globalization and automation have tended to push down manufacturing costs. Intense competition among retailers, especially with the rise of online shopping, meant those savings were mostly passed on to consumers.
Services prices, on the other hand, rarely fall, in part because wages account for a much larger share of the cost of most services. During the decade before the pandemic, services prices gradually rose while goods prices were flat or fell, resulting in an extended period of stable, moderate inflation.
Economists don’t expect to see outright deflation, in which prices fall for both goods and services. That’s a good thing: Overall price declines are generally viewed as economically dangerous, if they last.
There are a few reasons. For starters, in theory, deflation could prompt consumers to hold off on spending, touching off a downward spiral. People may be unlikely to buy today what they expect to be cheaper tomorrow. Once deflation takes hold, it can be difficult to escape: Japan has been stuck in a deflationary pattern since the late 1990s.
“When demand in the economy is weak, the last thing you want is someone to say, ‘I’m not going to buy that car today because it’s going to be $600 less expensive in six months,’” said Karen Dynan, an economist at Harvard.
For another, companies are unlikely to raise wages in a world where they cannot charge more. And if wages are not going up — or are even going down — it will be harder for households to keep up with fixed bills, like mortgage interest payments.
But while broad-based price declines are a problem, most economists view the more limited declines happening now as a sign that the economy is gradually moving past the disruptions of the pandemic.
“Supply chains have basically normalized,” said Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro. “Household demand behavior has basically normalized; the dollar is still pretty strong. I wouldn’t see a reason why goods prices would go higher.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With Shopify, Mercari and other retailers rolling out chatbots to help buyers, this holiday shopping season is the first to be powered by A.I.
To help with my holiday shopping this year, I recently turned to a new personal assistant online. "I'm looking for a Christmas present for my mother, who spends long hours working," I typed. "Is there something she can use in her office every day?"
"Of course!" came the instant reply. "Does your mother have any specific preferences or needs for her office? For example, does she need organization tools, desk accessories, or something to help her relax during breaks?"
So began my conversation with Shop A.I., a new chatbot from Shopify, an e-commerce marketplace. Over 10 minutes, Shop A.I. and I engaged in a question-and-answer session. I told the chatbot my budget and more about my mother, such as her need to alleviate back pain. Shop A.I. also asked me about my mother's preferred design and color for an office chair.
More people may eventually replicate this kind of shopping experience. A year after ChatGPT debuted, retailers around the world have started rolling out chatbots that are powered by generative artificial intelligence. That makes this holiday season the first when a slew of A.I. chatbots can help shoppers brainstorm and find presents for their friends and loved ones.
In addition to Shopify, chatbots have come out over the past 12 months from Instacart, the delivery company; Mercari, a resale platform; Carrefour, a retailer; and Kering, which owns Gucci and Balenciaga. Walmart, Mastercard and Signet Jewelers are also testing chatbots, which may become publicly available as soon as next year.
"In a way, it's recreating an in-store environment, but online," said Carl Rivera, a vice president at Shopify who oversees its Shop app, which hosts Shop A.I. He said the chatbot broke down people's questions into key terms and searched relevant products from Shopify's millions of sellers. It then recommends products based on reviews and a shopper's purchase history.
Retailers have long used chatbots, but previous versions lacked conversational power and typically answered just a few preset questions, such as the status of an order. The newest chatbots, by contrast, can process prompts and generate tailored answers, both of which create a more "personalized and authentic interaction," said Jen Jones, the chief marketing officer of the platform Commercetools.
Whether shoppers want this technology remains a question. "Consumers like simplicity, so they don't necessarily want to have five different generative A.I. tools that they would use for different purposes," said Olivier Toubia, a marketing professor at Columbia Business School.
Nicola Conway, a lawyer in London, tried Kering's luxury personal shopper, Madeline, in August to search for a pink bridesmaid dress for a spring wedding. Madeline was "intuitive and novel," she said, but it gave only one recommendation, an Alexander McQueen corset dress. Ms. Conway did not end up buying it.
Kering did not respond to requests for comment.
Maggie Weber, a shopping influencer who uses the social media handle @refashionedhippie, said she tried Mercari's chatbot, Merchat A.I., in May. She asked the chatbot to show her baseball cards, but she was instead offered baseballs -- and then hats, bats and jerseys.
"Merchat is still in its infancy," Ms. Weber, 34, said. She added that she worried that if she gave the chatbot too much information, it would start directing personalized ads to her.
A Mercari spokeswoman said Merchat used chat history only to recommend products and did not use personally identifiable information. She added that the search bar could be faster for customers who want a specific item, while the chatbot helped those who want "inspiration for gifts."
Such inspiration was exactly what I needed this season as I had only vague ideas for what to buy my 53-year-old mother and my 17-year-old cousin, Jenny.
So I tried Shop A.I. After telling the chatbot about my mother's back pain and asking what I could buy to help her relax, Shop A.I. offered to find an ergonomic chair and asked my budget. When I said $ 100, it came back with a few pages of product results.
"Can you help me to narrow it down?" I typed. Shop A.I. then asked about my preferred color for a chair. I said black.
Shop A.I. returned more than 300 results, including a $ 159 camp chair from ROAM Adventure, a $ 179.99 reclining massage office chair from homrest and a $ 269.99 CosyGaming executive chair.
"These don't seem to be under $ 100," I wrote, annoyed.
"As a new chatbot, I'm still learning and sometimes the search results may not be accurate," Shop A.I. replied. "Let me try again and find some black ergonomic chairs within your budget."
Then, it added, "It seems that I'm having trouble finding black ergonomic chairs within your budget at the moment."
I ended up typing "black ergonomic chair" into the search bar myself and set a $ 100 price range. A $ 66.81 Victory Furniture gaming chair and a $ 47.96 massage office chair popped up, though they were too big and heavy to be gifts.
Eventually, I asked Shop A.I. for alternative ideas and received five options, including seat cushions and standing desk converters.
I chose the standing desk converter and gave Shop A.I. my $ 100 budget. This time, the chatbot showed options within my price range, including a $ 99 Risedesk standing desk converter. But most of the products did not have reviews, which I rely on while shopping online. I didn't buy anything.
Shop A.I. was not great at finding a gift for my cousin, either. I wanted to buy Jenny some college dorm decorations featuring her favorite anime series, Violet Evergarden, which follows a character named Violet as she recovers from an unidentified war.
But Shop A.I. appeared to decide that anything the color violet was connected to my query. It showed me wall art of purple mountains and posters of purple BMW cars.
So I turned to Mercari's Merchat. After asking for my cousin's hobby (anime), age (17) and what she might prefer for college (dorm decorations), Merchat offered three gift ideas: wall tapestries, string lights and desk accessories in the theme of Violet Evergarden.
Merchat showed me four products under each category, all of which were under my budget of $ 50. I ended up buying an $ 18 Violet Evergarden poster scroll for Jenny. (She later told me she wished I had gotten her something quirkier.)
Emboldened by the experience, I asked Merchat to help find a present for my mother. "Would she benefit from a back support cushion, a heating pad or maybe a massage chair pad?" it asked.
"What are the pros and cons of each?" I typed.
Merchat said it couldn't provide specific pros and cons for individual items. I changed my question to: "Which one is the easiest to use?"
This time, Merchat was definitive: the back support cushion, which was portable. Merchat detailed the differences between a memory-foam cushion and a firmer one, then further grouped memory-foam cushions into three categories and displayed the top four results for each, all under $ 100.
While I didn't buy any because the styles were limited, it was a great starting point.
"Thank you," I wrote.
"You're welcome!" Merchat replied. "Happy shopping and have a wonderful time with your family!"

For Climate Change, a Point of 'Hope and Peril': [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For this year's United Nations climate summit, the reporter David Gelles flew to the United Arab Emirates to discuss the world's environmental future with industry leaders.
About 70,000 people arrived in the United Arab Emirates, one of the world's largest oil producers, for this year's United Nations climate summit, known as COP28.
Industry leaders, heads of state and diplomats gathered in Dubai at the annual summit to discuss ways to reduce emissions from fossil fuels and steer the world toward a more sustainable future. David Gelles, who writes the Climate Forward newsletter for The New York Times, was among the attendees. He spent eight days reporting from the summit, which concludes Tuesday.
It was the third U.N. climate summit that Mr. Gelles attended as a reporter; he previously covered financial news for The Times and joined the Climate team in 2022. In an interview, he discussed how his background in business reporting shaped his approach to covering COP28 and what he learned from industry leaders. This conversation has been edited and condensed.
Is there anything in particular from your past U.N. summit experiences that you kept front of mind while reporting at COP28?
I've covered the climate beat for a couple of years now, so one of the great things that happened this year was that I ran into people everywhere I went. I couldn't walk from one building to the next around the convention center, which is the size of Central Park, without bumping into one, two or even three people. Sometimes they were C.E.O.s of big nonprofit organizations, like the Natural Resources Defense Council. Sometimes they were negotiators from different delegations, like Barbados. And sometimes they were executives who I've interviewed onstage before. COP is this critical mass of people working in the climate space who are all in one place at the same time. That's a really exceptional experience.
Does your background in financial reporting help with the climate beat, especially when you run into industry leaders?
Big time. A big part of my climate coverage, for more than a year, has been the business angle. That's not just how big companies are trying to become more sustainable themselves, or make their supply chains greener. It's also how banks and big international lenders like the World Bank are trying to adapt to take on the climate crisis in more aggressive ways. Reporting on business for 15 years has been an enormous help as I cover the money angle of the climate story.
Were the financial angles your main focus during the conference?
I wore a bunch of different hats. For the first couple of days, I anchored The Times's live blog. I wrote a front-page article after the first full day of the conference. I then shifted into a space where I was taking lots of meetings, both those I had arranged ahead of time and spontaneous ones with C.E.O.s and negotiators on the sidelines. In the evenings, I moderated live New York Times events that took place at COP.
On Monday, Dec. 4, I did a fireside chat with former Vice President Al Gore and then interviewed several other nonprofit development experts and negotiators. The president of the World Bank, Ajay Banga, who I knew when he was C.E.O. of Mastercard, dropped by before dinner. I interviewed him and I wrote an article about what was happening with the World Bank.
With so much going on, did you have a reporting routine?
There are not remotely enough hours in the day. Typically, I would have between two and five meetings scheduled over the course of a day and then try to leave time for spontaneous meetings. Those meetings were usually in different places around the expo area. Sometimes I would interview someone that I bumped into; sometimes I would see someone sitting at a coffee shop, having lunch, and I would sit down with them and interview them right there.
You had to be very opportunistic and not be afraid to pull out your tape recorder at any time. They were long, long days.
What were your main takeaways after talking to industry leaders?
It's a moment of both hope and peril when you think about climate change right now. On the one hand, there are real gains in renewable energy. There is real momentum to try to reform the global financial system to make it more responsive to climate change. At the same time, we are just concluding the hottest year in recorded history. There are more climate disasters just about every week around the world; fossil fuel emissions and demand for fossil fuels, which is the main driver for global warming, continue to rise. We're at this very precarious moment where there's a lot of momentum. But things are also seriously dangerous. That's why everyone is working as hard and as fast as they can to try to get us out of this mess. But it's not going to be easy.

Full text: The programs and the incentives that come with them will be critical for retailers hoping to attract cash-strapped customers over the next month.
Chrissy West is taking a new approach to her Christmas shopping this year. When buying gifts for her family, she plans to finance them by cashing in her Ulta loyalty points.
A makeup aficionado who enjoys buying lip gloss and blush, Ms. West has racked up hundreds of loyalty points at Ulta, the beauty retailer. During a shopping haul in September, she redeemed over 800 points, which brought an $ 89 bill down to $ 57.
Ms. West has focused on spending less money this year, and using her loyalty points is the way she plans to actually do that during the holiday shopping season. She has 233 points left.
"I would just use my points on the gifts for my sisters because I kind of have all the products that I want," said Ms. West, a 23-year-old graduate student in Tallahassee, Fla. "I would like to use it to the point where it's almost free, but because I have so little it's just going to be a discount."
Ms. West is not alone in her approach. This holiday season, 39 percent of shoppers plan to use rewards and cash-back offers to buy gifts for others, according to a PayPal survey released in November. Nearly the same proportion of people said they would use their rewards points on items for themselves.
Retailers are taking notice. These programs and the incentives that come with them will be critical to attracting shoppers, who are slowing their overall spending and holding out for deals before buying. Stores recruit customers into their loyalty programs throughout the year, but the programs become a major attraction at the end of the year -- when retailers can make up to a third of their annual revenue. Retailers are also spending the year testing different incentive strategies, but they roll them out en masse during December.
Customers see the benefit in these programs, with the money they spend getting rewarded through free products or other perks. One in four shoppers feels that buying gifts using rewards is getting something for free, according to the PayPal survey.
"This is the time of year that brands put on their most aggressive loyalty tactic," said Stephanie Meltzer-Paul, a Mastercard executive who helps retail clients shape their loyalty programs.
The shoe retailer DSW, with 27 million members, is among the companies leaning into their loyalty programs. On Black Friday and Cyber Monday, it offered a four-piece travel kit as a gift with purchase -- an incentive it does just five times a year. Online, it's pushing a "12 days of V.I.P. deals" program to loyalty shoppers.
"Those extra incentives to get them to convert give them validation that they're making the right choice, but doing so in a fun experience," Julie Roy, DSW's chief marketing officer, said in an interview.
Many retailers, like Sephora, are turning the act of earning points into a game. The beauty retailer is allowing loyalty members to rack up points by performing certain tasks, such as signing up for text alerts or buying something online and picking it up in a store.
Ulta, which has among the biggest U.S. retail loyalty programs, with 42 million members, knows that people like the feeling of accumulating points. Fifty-six percent of shoppers told Ulta that earning points was a main reason they shopped during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
Typically, Ulta offers shoppers points that are equal to the price of the item. Spend $ 80, get 80 points. During promotions this holiday season, it is offering customers the opportunity to boost their points by five times the amount of a purchase. So that $ 80 can now equal 400 points. The calculations can get complicated, though, and there are TikTok channels dedicated to decoding "Ulta math." For example, one creator explained in a video that if she bought beauty products on a day when Ulta was offering double points for purchases, she had money for a future purchase that would then feel free to her.
"People are genuinely trying to maximize volume in very different ways, and the points are a critical enabler of that," Michelle Crossan-Matos, Ulta's chief marketing officer, said in an interview.
Kim Spader, a 44-year-old secretary at a middle school in Mystic, Conn., in October posted a video on TikTok about how she combined her 10,000 Ulta points with a 20 percent coupon for a shopping spree worth $ 800 in October. The video has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
Ms. Spader, who last year was paid by Ulta to create content on social media but is not currently compensated by the retailer, estimated that she spent $ 1,200 on makeup, hair care and skin care starting in April, much of which she used when creating content. She boosted her overall point count by timing her purchases of certain brands or products to when Sephora offered deals that would multiply her points.
"You don't want to buy a product just because there is a point multiplier," Ms. Spader said. "Don't put it on credit cards for the sake of buying it. But if you're buying the product anyway, and can earn more points quickly, it's a great way to get 'free' makeup."
Toward the end of the year, shoppers also race to secure a higher tier of status within many loyalty programs. Generally companies boost incentives for members who hold higher status. For example, Ulta loyalty members of the highest tier earn 1.5 points for every purchase they make. Each year, shoppers look to secure and boost their status, before the process starts all over again come January. Recognizing this, Ulta is not shy about sending emails to remind members that they are close to reaching a new tier -- if they spend more.
"People are obsessed about elevating in their tiers," Ms. Crossan-Matos said. "They feel like they're getting extra benefits. People love the concept of building points so that when they do see something that they absolutely love that might be a stretch cash-wise, that they can invest in themselves or invest in gifts."
Of course, encouraging shoppers to spend is beneficial to Ulta, where the end-of-the-year shopping period brings in nearly a third of its annual sales.
For retailers, the holidays can be an opportune time to turn customers into new loyalty members, hoping the programs will get customers to return in the coming year.
"If you get somebody to redeem a reward, they'll spend more later," said Kate Hogenson, a principal consultant at the Mallett Group, a brand-loyalty consulting firm. "Ulta has the highest penetration of any loyalty program out there, and 95 percent of its revenue is attached to a loyalty member."
When Ulta offered a 20 percent discount on its Dyson Airwrap hair dryer (which retails for $ 600), it saw a spike in sales as people cashed in their points to purchase it. During major sales like these, shoppers go to TikTok to giddily share the moment when their bill dropped precipitously after their points are redeemed at the register.
"We see a number of loyalty programs, including ours, that people really enjoy being able to share what they're doing with their loyalty points and being rewarded for it," Ms. Crossan-Matos said. "Gamification" -- adding competitive elements to the shopping process -- "on its own is not that exciting," she added. "It's when you feel like you're part of a community that is celebrating who you are, what you're doing and it infuses more points and rewards for you."
Ms. West, the graduate student in Florida, has posted on TikTok about her Ulta purchases and the free black Fenty tote bag that she got when she made a purchase. Still, she knows there's always room to be savvier.
"Because of the way I spent this year, I have a new strategy for next year," Ms. West said. "Don't spend all my points in one go."

New Leader of the World Bank Is Prioritizing Climate Change Issues: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ajay Banga, who took over the top job in June, has prioritized global warming issues in his first months on the job.
For years now, heads of state and government, academics and development experts have been calling on the World Bank to lead in the fight against climate change.
For too long, they say, the international lender had ignored the growing threats posed by rising temperatures and sea levels, been too conservative with its lending to developing countries struggling with climate disasters, and spent too much money supporting fossil fuels, the burning of which is dangerously heating the planet.
Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, led the charge, rolling out a reform agenda known as the Bridgetown Initiative and rallying others, including Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, to join her.
At the United Nations climate talks in Dubai, which began Nov. 30 and run until Dec. 12, it is clear that much is changing at the World Bank.
Ajay Banga, 64, the former chief executive of Mastercard, took over as president in June. He replaced David Malpass, who was nominated by President Trump and stepped down early after coming under fire for disputing the science of climate change in a live interview with The New York Times.
And while the World Bank has not instituted the sort of sweeping overhaul envisioned by its most ardent critics, Mr. Banga, an Indian-born American, has over the past six months made a series of changes that he said are aimed at addressing the climate crisis.
As the planet warms and storms, and drought, wildfires and flooding grow more extreme, poor countries are in a particularly difficult spot. They are desperate for funds to recover from climate disasters while also starved for money to prepare for the next calamity. They are saddled with debt, yet need to invest in a transition away from fossil fuels so they can lower the emissions that are heating the planet and causing so much damage in the first place.
The International Monetary Fund has also been accused of not doing enough to help countries adapt to climate change, and of burdening poor nations with debt, and has made some modest changes. But, under Mr. Banga, the World Bank has leaned into its climate work.
Just weeks after he took over, the bank said it would pause debt and interest payments for countries hit by natural disasters, including hurricanes and wildfires made worse by global warming.
A full 45 percent of the bank's lending is now going toward climate-related projects, including new renewable energy construction, up from 36 percent the previous year.
The World Bank is piloting new efforts to reduce methane emissions and help poor countries create accountable marketplaces for carbon credits.
The bank agreed to serve as the home of a new, so-called loss and damage fund that will distribute money to poor countries that have suffered irreplaceable losses because of climate disasters.
And Mr. Banga has been working to streamline a bureaucratic and siloed organization, pushing it to move faster and stressing collaboration.
"This is all sensible stuff," Mr. Banga said in an interview. "The fact is, we should have a vision that is redefined from the past, and that includes addressing global crises and having livable planet."
Outside observers have so far been broadly supportive of Mr. Banga.
"Ajay is trying to put climate and reduction of vulnerability across the world front and center," said Hilen Meirovich, head of climate change at IDB Invest, a development bank. "There's a lot of commitments and collaborating and testing that is happening."
Hans Peter Lankes, the managing director of ODI, a global affairs research organization, worked at the World Bank until a few years ago and said the institution has been transformed under Mr. Banga.
"If you talk to anyone in the World Bank, the atmosphere has changed enormously," he said. "The whole sense of purpose has changed."
Mr. Banga appears to have forged a bond with Ms. Mottley of Barbados. The two met for the first time early this year, in an airport lounge in London. They bonded over a shared love of cricket, a sport popular in both of their birth countries, and Ms. Mottley outlined her vision on how the bank should change. Since then, they have become friendly and have appeared together multiple times, including at a New York Times event in September.
"We've not been that bothered about whether it's called Bridgetown or not," said Avinash Persaud, the Barbados climate envoy. "It's a collection of ideas. It is a vision of finance. And I would say the victory of 2023 has been that this new climate financial system has emerged."
Yet there is only so much Mr. Banga can do on his own. At the end of the day, the World Bank is governed by its shareholders: the United States, China, Germany, France, Japan and other major economies.
Without those countries agreeing to contribute more capital and accept more risk, the bank will be limited in how much money it can make available for developing countries trying to adapt to climate change.
Fossil fuel lending by the bank has decreased, but it persists as many developing countries continue to seek economic growth through new oil and gas projects.
"The easy, low hanging fruit is being picked off," said Manish Bapna, chief executive of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Now it's the bigger fruit we have to play for."
The bank's major shareholders have not signaled that they are prepared to drastically increase their overall contributions. But Mr. Banga has said that, so far, the big shareholders had been supportive of the new emphasis on climate.
"Right now, I cannot complain about the board on this kind of stuff," Mr. Banga said.
The World Bank still faces plenty of challenges in the months ahead. High interest rates continue to make lending expensive, especially in the developing world. Tensions over the role of China, which is a major shareholder and also a major borrower form the bank, persist. And with a staff of more than 10,000 spread across 170 countries, reforming an entrenched bureaucracy remains a challenge.
"You have to change the business model of the institution in order to deliver on a challenge of this size," Mr. Lankes said. "That's going to be a tall order."

Retailers See Potential Chill In Spending For Holidays: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Black Friday weekend had a decent turnout for retailers, but it's unclear if the rest of the season will deliver for the industry.
Eager for bargains, American consumers filled their shopping carts last weekend with holiday gifts. But it isn't yet clear if that means this will be a successful season for retailers.
Early readings of spending over the Thanksgiving weekend suggest that consumers spent more than they did last year -- but that's only because prices are higher. It might still be considered good news, if viewed against earlier expectations that rising prices, higher interest rates, the return of student loan payments and concern about the economy could have had people pull back on spending.
But the critical measure of the health of consumers will be if they keep spending this month, even when those extraordinary Black Friday discounts are gone. In recent months, companies have reported seeing consumers respond more to promotions, like the ones offered last weekend, and shying away from big purchases.
Although Black Friday gets a lot of attention, the holiday shopping season runs through December, and for it to be a success for retailers, they'll need people to pay higher prices for the rest of the year than they did in the days after Thanksgiving. If businesses have to keep deepening discounts just to get people in the door, that's going to be a problem.
"That's what will determine the winners and losers as we get through the rest of the holiday season," Matthew Shay, chief executive of the National Retail Federation, a trade group, said on a recent conference call. The federation kept its forecast that holiday sales -- from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31 -- would grow 3 to 4 percent this year.
That forecast isn't adjusted for inflation. Neither are the early readings of sales over the weekend. Mastercard, for example, said sales both in stores and online rose 2.5 percent on Nov. 24, from a year earlier. But with consumer goods -- excluding food and fuel -- rising at an annual rate of around 4 percent, that suggests that retailers aren't necessarily moving more merchandise.
"We think sales were not strong; they were so-so, to the point of being mediocre," said Craig Johnson, the founder of the retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners. His firm estimated that sales from Black Friday though Cyber Monday was $ 94.2 billion, up about 2.5 percent from last year. Like Mastercard, the retail consultancy forecast that -- adjusted for inflation -- sales slipped slightly, Mr. Johnson said.
Some large retailers seem to be prepared for the slowdown in demand. Companies like Target and Macy's have reported that they've cut inventory levels in recent quarters, and that may put them in a better position to profit even if demand is weaker, said Edward Yruma, an analyst at the investment bank Piper Sandler.

If stores have too much inventory on hand, they may have to cut prices more than expected, which would erode their profits.
"Really for the first time in four quarters, we are seeing retailers get inventories better aligned with sales," Mr. Yruma said. "That's allowing them to have on-plan promotions."
Retailers have been keeping a close eye on consumer behavior over the past year. The pandemic-era fiscal stimulus checks that many used to shop in the past two years have now been spent. And while the rate at which prices are rising has eased significantly, the overall increase in prices is starting to weigh on customers. High interest rates and the restart of student loan payments are weighing on consumers, too.
After more than a year of touting a resilient consumer, many companies reported in the most recent quarter that customers seemed to be pulling back.
Brian C. Cornell, chief executive of Target, told analysts on a recent earnings call that the company was "navigating through a very challenging environment as consumers continue to rebalance their spending between goods and experiences and make tough choices in the face of persistent inflation."
The most recent Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation measure, released on Thursday, confirmed that consumer spending slowed in October. People are also looking to spend more on services like plane tickets instead of goods like video games.
And those consumers are showing signs of distress in other ways. Adobe, which tracks online spending over the Black Friday weekend, said purchases made with "buy now pay later" plans that let people buy on credit rose 42.5 percent from last year.
It's true that the buy now pay later options are more readily available than in recent years, but the retailers that offer other forms of credit are reporting higher delinquencies. That suggests that consumers won't be able to continue spending like as have been, said Kathryn Rooney Vera, chief market strategist at StoneX, a financial services company.
"It's not sustainable," she continued. "It shows an unhealthy trend."

It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year (For the Economy): [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: For many Americans, the end of the year is a time for parties, family gatherings, festive meals and, of course, shopping. And all that celebrating makes the fourth quarter the most important time of the year for the U.S. economy.
Looking at the past three decades of monthly retail spending data, when not adjusted for seasonality, December of each year is easy to spot.
When this pattern breaks, something has gone awry. In the midst of the Great Recession, people cut back on nonessential holiday spending, and end-of-the-year purchases took a significant hit.
In 2020, despite the economic crisis caused by the pandemic, December spending increased from the year before. Many Americans had extra cash to spend thanks to government stimulus payments, and holiday spending was a large part of how they chose to use it, contributing to the economic recovery.
This seasonal trend is robust enough that it's visible in our economy beyond just end-of-the-year retail shopping and food.
The last quarter of the year nearly always produces more than each of the first three when it comes to G.D.P. Americans' ability to spend their way through the darkest months of the year is a key component in the health of the economy.
As Black Friday and the last few weeks of 2023 approach, economists will be keenly attuned to what consumers are doing. Michelle Meyer, a chief economist at Mastercard, said this was likely to be "a promotion-driven holiday season," in which shoppers will patiently wait for the best deals.
But Ms. Meyer is still expecting consumers to be "quite active" this year, increasing their holiday spending over last year. In an effort to curb inflation, the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates over the past 20 months, and experts have been on the lookout for a recession. But for now, there's hope for an economically festive holiday season.

Xi to Address U.S. Business Leaders as Concerns Grow About Investing in China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Corporate executives will pay $ 2,000 a head to dine with China's leader in San Francisco next week, in one of a series of engagements aimed at stabilizing the U.S.-China relationship.
The Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who is set to meet with President Biden in San Francisco next week, is expected to speak to top American business executives at a dinner following that bilateral meeting.
Mr. Xi, who is traveling to the United States for an international conference, will address business leaders at a challenging moment in U.S.-China relations. The United States has expressed growing concern about China's military ambitions and has sought to cut off Beijing's access to technology that could be used against the United States. China's treatment of Western companies, which are facing tougher restrictions in how they do business, have also prompted firms to question the wisdom of investing in China.
Still, Chinese and American leaders have expressed interest in bolstering ties between their economies, the world's two largest, which remain inextricably linked through trade. The Biden administration has sent several top officials to China this year to try to make clear that while the United States wants to protect national security, it does not seek to sever economic ties with Beijing.
It is unclear whether Mr. Xi's visit will do much to alleviate the skepticism of foreign businesses, many of which are deterred both by China's slowing economic growth and the tighter grip of the Chinese Communist Party on business activity under Mr. Xi.
Tickets to the dinner and reception, hosted by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations and the U.S.-China Business Council, cost $ 2,000 each, according to an invitation circulating online. For $ 40,000, companies can purchase eight seats at a table plus one seat at Mr. Xi's table, a person familiar with the event said.
Engagements between Chinese officials and the U.S. business sector will try to send the signal that China remains an attractive place to do business, "as evidenced by these companies flocking to meet with Xi Jinping and have dinner with him," Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in a briefing on Tuesday.
Beijing wants this for "tactical reasons," Mr. Blanchette said. "I don't think, at a broad level, they're expecting or see the prospect of resetting or recalibrating the relationship."
Foreign firms are particularly concerned about Chinese regulations that block them from selling to the government or into certain markets, and a broader counter-espionage law that can lead to prison time for company executives and researchers who deal in sensitive industries. At the same time, the United States is stepping up restrictions on investing and selling advanced technology to China, saying that such ties can pose national security concerns.
Many businesses still see China as an essential market, but an increasing number are starting to look to other countries for their new investments. A survey by the U.S.-China Business Council of its members this year found that 34 percent had stopped or reduced planned investment in China over the past year, a higher percentage than in previous years.
Mr. Blanchette said Chinese officials would also see the meeting as an opportunity to try to shift the U.S. trajectory on the technology controls it has placed on China. But the United States is unlikely to change its stance, he said.
"I think this will be one of the issues where the U.S. and China will have longstanding tensions. And I'm sure this will be communicated to Beijing," Mr. Blanchette said.
The visit will be Mr. Xi's first trip to the United States since 2017, when he met with President Donald J. Trump at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Since then, U.S.-China business relations have changed drastically, with the countries carrying out a trade war and sparring over advanced technology and geopolitical influence, and China turning notably more authoritarian under Mr. Xi.
The dinner and reception featuring Mr. Xi will be part of a two-day "C.E.O. Summit" taking place next week on the sidelines of a bigger meeting of the leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, a group of 21 countries that ring the Pacific Ocean. Mr. Biden is expected to meet with Mr. Xi earlier next Wednesday, in their first face-to-face meeting in a year.
Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi are expected to discuss business and technology ties, as well as issues like communication between the countries' militaries, stopping the flow of fentanyl to the United States and new agreements for governing artificial intelligence.
In recent weeks high-level Chinese officials have met with U.S. counterparts to lay the groundwork for the trip. In a news release Wednesday, the organizers of the C.E.O. summit said that Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi would be in attendance at the two-day summit, along with other world leaders and the chief executives of companies including Microsoft, Mastercard and Pfizer.

Look Who's on the Scent: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: Corporations are now mimicking fashion designers and hiring development firms to create a signature scent that clients won't forget.
Dora Baghriche grew up in Algiers, where the scents of jasmine, pine, orange blossom and Mediterranean salt spray swirled around her, wafting into her memory.
"Both of my grandmothers were chefs so I grew up in the kitchens and smelling the fields of flowers around our house," she said from her home in Paris. Ms. Baghriche, a senior perfumer at the fragrance development company Firmenich, has since created scents for major fashion houses like Yves Saint Laurent and Estée Lauder.
But one of the most unusual challenges of her career came when an unexpected brand asked her to design a fragrance for new spaces they were building called "experience centers."
The brand was Mastercard, befuddling Ms. Baghriche, 43. "When Mastercard told me what they wanted to do, my first question was, 'Why?"' she said.
The mission behind the experience centers is to give the credit card giant a physical footprint for its brand and show off its newest technology. This was unexplored territory for Mastercard, and the company's marketing team wanted to create a space that engaged all of a customer's senses.
Companies using bespoke scents in their spaces are nothing new. Hotels that want to exude a sense of luxurious relaxation have been designing their own candles for decades, and no one who stepped into an Abercrombie & Fitch store in the 2000s will ever forget the olfactory sting of the brand's musky cologne that fogged their retail stores.
But smell is increasingly becoming part of the brand strategy for companies in unexpected industries, as brands jostle for precious slivers of market share and especially as workers and clients begin to trickle back into office spaces. So the unlikeliest of companies are joining the scent trend.
"Traditionally, marketers have focused on creating mostly a visual identity for their brands. A logo, a design style, the kind of thing that makes it easy to say 'that's Apple' or 'that's Mastercard.' But one key thing that wasn't appreciated is that we're generally blessed with five senses," said Raja Rajamannar, chief marketing officer at Mastercard.
Mr. Rajamannar, 61, spearheaded the "multisensory brand identity" effort for the credit card company, and commissioned Ms. Baghriche and Firmenich to create a dual set of complementary fragrances inspired by the interlocking red and orange circles from Mastercard's logo and the abstract prompts "passion" and "optimism."
Since you can't smell a TV or internet ad -- they're working on that -- fragrance hasn't been much of a consideration for marketing departments in industries like insurance and financial services. But physical spaces are now doubling as unorthodox, semi-permanent marketing efforts. Luxury car brands like Genesis operate white-tablecloth restaurants with classically-trained chefs, and the travel search platform Kayak runs a hotel in Miami.
"We have customers that often ask about the scent and whether it's for sale," said Rachel Espersen, executive director of brand experience at Genesis House and Studios, a multipurpose space in the Meatpacking district operated by the luxury carmaker. The venue contains a restaurant, a library and a showroom, and the company designed three scents that are diffused in different spaces. "In our studio and showcase spaces, we either use a scent called 'Down to Earth' or 'Coming Home,' depending on the space's specific design. The first floor showroom and cellar stage at Genesis House uses the 'Down to Earth' scent," she said in an email.
Credit card companies have been especially active in this new arena: Mastercard has its "experience centers" in cities like Dubai, Mexico City, and New York. American Express has created a Centurion members club in a high-rise in New York, and has exclusive airport lounges. Automakers are extending their brand names to condominiums, especially in Miami.
How a place smells is now something that companies need to think about in the same way they pick out chairs or choose wallpaper.
They also need to budget for them. "A custom scent could be anywhere from $ 5,000 to $ 65,000, and we live on the higher end of that number," said Dawn Goldworm, the co-founder of 12.29, a scent branding company that has worked with several large banks and car companies, including Cadillac.
Developing a bespoke scent is only the beginning as well, as companies have to pay for the creation of fragrance oil and a dedicated dispersal system that can sometimes be installed in a space's HVAC system. "It can cost anywhere from $ 100 every month to thousands every month. You need the machinery, you need someone to install it, you need someone to service it, and you need the supply of fragrance oil on a regular basis," Ms. Goldworm, 44, said.
Perfumers like Ms. Baghriche are typically tasked with creating scents that live on skin, where biochemical reactions can alter how a fragrance smells on different people. If delicate changes like a person's skin pH level can change the iconic whiff of, say, Chanel No. 5 perfume, how do you create a stable scent for millions of square feet of commercial space?
Part of the answer is creating a fragrance that doesn't make anyone run for the exits. "Universality was a really important factor. We didn't want to design anything that would be shocking to a specific culture," Ms. Baghriche said.
Some smells -- fresh citrus, floral notes -- hold a sweeping appeal, and Ms. Baghriche considered those scents when she was developing Mastercard's scent. The twin scents she created -- "Priceless Passion" and "Priceless Optimism" -- have murmurs of rose, sweet grass and orange.
Smell and memory speak fluently to one another. Research has shown our olfactory senses develop more quickly than sight, and that the creation of memories associated with smell follows a more direct path than sound.
In a way, Ms. Baghriche's job is to use the echoes of jasmine, orange blossom, and the Mediterranean salt spray from her own life to impress new memories on those who encounter her work. "Our house was in a pine forest and we lived just above the sea," she said. "I grew up with all those Mediterranean smells. It was a really romantic childhood."

24-Hour Kebab Joint Rebounds Amid Gentrification: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A story as old as raising the rent: A beloved restaurant gets gentrified out of the neighborhood. But this time, somehow, it returns, nearly a decade later.
It was another Friday night on the Lower East Side, with young bar hoppers spilling out onto East Houston Street in search of their next cocktail. A group of women in nearly identical lacy tank tops rolled their eyes at the catcalls coming from a nearby car, while one man pushed another into a pile of garbage bags, upset over a disrespectful comment.
But some, like Nikki D'Alessendro, were ready to call it a night. As she walked home after a night out with friends, Ms. D'Alessendro said she noticed the bright lights and the meat rotisserie of a Turkish restaurant on the corner of Orchard Street. She realized she was famished, and she walked in.
"I really don't know where I am," said Ms. D'Alessendro, a 23-year-old who works in retail. "I'm here because the place was open."
Besides not noticing the name of the establishment, she also missed the big signs on the windows that said, "Bereket Is Back!"
"I don't know what that means," she said, "but I love gyros." She went with the lamb doner sandwich and ate it at a small table by the front door, entertained by the crowd passing by.
To the current late-night revelers, the sign probably means nothing. But to those who lived and frequented downtown Manhattan in the '90s, it signals the return of the Bereket Turkish Kabob House, a former all-night stalwart that fed cabdrivers and inebriated customers for nearly 20 years before closing.
And it also signals a rarity in the landscape of New York real estate: A beloved restaurant that shuttered when its neighborhood was gentrified, against incredible odds, actually returned to the block.
Suleyman Turgut and Ramazan Turgut, the two brothers who owned Bereket -- which, despite the big sign in the window, is actually called Ankara #3 -- are taking a gamble that New Yorkers still have an appetite for late-night meals. When the new place opened in March, the kitchen closed at 4 a.m. But over the summer, the Turgut brothers saw enough bar patrons packing the streets to now keep the eatery open 24 hours, bucking the post-pandemic trend of restaurants paring back their hours.
Their late-night journey began when Haci Turugt, the eldest brother, immigrated to New York in the 1980s, and Suleyman followed in 1990. The two worked at a kebab joint in Greenwich Village until they opened their own shop on East Houston Street in 1995.
At first, Bereket was a sliver of a store with only three small tables. The primary customers were cabbies on a shift change: "We did great business at 5 a.m.," said Suleyman, 56.
Riding a wave of success, the brothers were able to expand to a larger space on the southeast corner of East Houston and Orchard Streets six years later. It became an extension of the bar scene: Instant friendships were forged as the sun rose, and scuffles would erupt just as quickly.
The restaurant could even break up a romance.
Debbie Tobias, who lived on the Lower East Side during Bereket's heyday, said she once stopped dating a guy because he disliked the smell of doner meat.
"I knew right there and then he was a one and done," said Ms. Tobias, an art director who is now 52 and lives in Kensington, Brooklyn. "I could never be with someone who didn't like Bereket."
By the time Ramazan, the youngest of the Turgut brothers, immigrated to New York in 2006, business was robust, as the bar scene had exploded in the area. Over the years, the Turguts estimated that they had hired more than 100 immigrants from Turkey and elsewhere, many of whom went to school during the day and worked at night. About 15 of them have opened up their own restaurants nationwide, according to Suleyman.
But then came the bad news, in 2014: Their lease would not be renewed. Almost the entire block of Houston, except for Katz's Delicatessen, would be razed to build a new condominium building. It was peak gentrification, and the brothers weren't able to secure a new space that was financially sound.
Gutted, the brothers went their separate ways. Haci and Suleyman returned to Turkey; Ramazan stayed in New York. The youngest Turgut opened a restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and when that closed after a few years, he worked as a manager at a few other eateries for other owners, but nothing seemed to match the magic of Bereket.
Then, in 2019, Suleyman's daughter had been accepted to college in New York. Tired of working for others, Ramazan persuaded his older brother to follow his daughter and revive Bereket in central Brooklyn to target a different clientele, or the new immigrants from Central Asia that had settled in Kensington and Midwood.
The pandemic was an unexpected boon for delivery orders, which skyrocketed. Then, as the city's nightlife woke from its slumber, several cabdrivers told the Turguts that there was an empty storefront on Houston. It was right across the street from where Bereket used to be.
The brothers jumped on it, and their timing looks canny. Late-night spending, between the hours of 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., in the city is 11 percent higher than prepandemic levels, according to aggregated spending trends analyzed by Mastercard Economics Institute. And there are more than 500 bars and restaurants serving alcohol in the Lower East Side and East Village, according to State Liquor Authority data.
But as the brothers court a new generation of customers, where 3 a.m. is their new peak hour, nostalgia keeps the older clientele returning.
One weekday afternoon, Olcay Dikbiyik found herself eating a doner kebab. She was a regular Bereket customer when she lived in Queens, but now lived in Marco Island, Fla. Yet as soon as she arrived in the city with her family for a weekend getaway, her first internet search was to determine whether Bereket was still open.
"We got off the flight, checked into the hotel, and came straight here," said Ms. Dikbiyik, 45.
Ramazan, who spoke to Ms. Dikbiyik and her family as she ate a late lunch, beamed. "It's wonderful that they came back."
"I can't tell you how many people have walked in crying, hugging us," said Ramazan. "I feel it in my heart. It feels great."

Inching Closer to Power, Labour Party Has a Love-In With Corporate Britain: [News Analysis]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The governing Conservative Party was long seen as entrepreneurs' natural ally and lobbyists' most important target. With an election on the horizon, that's changing.
It was impossible to miss: a large green, yellow and blue off-road vehicle parked in a prime spot in the exhibition hall at the Labour Party's annual conference. The car belonged to Ineos, one of the world's largest chemical companies, and its outsize presence, among dozens of businesses and organizations, marked the company's first time attending the gathering.
Andrew Gardner, who runs Ineos's huge refinery complex in Grangemouth, Scotland, was standing by the vehicle on Tuesday afternoon, grabbing time with passing Labour lawmakers to discuss the company's goals.
He had never attended a Labour conference before, and skipped the governing Conservative Party's the previous week, but said he had come to this one, in the northern English city of Liverpool, because Labour was expected to form the next government. His colleague Richard Longden, Ineos's head of communications, chimed in, describing "a vibe here of a party that's changed, and one that's looking forward to the future. And business needs to be speaking to them and needs to be seen."
"Which is exactly why we're here," Mr. Gardner added.
In Britain, the Conservative Party has traditionally been seen as the party of business and the guardians of free enterprise. Now, under the centrist leadership of Keir Starmer, Labour is taking over that mantle. As the party inches closer to power, with a general election expected next year, it is engaged in a mutually beneficial love-in with the corporate sector.
At the four-day conference this week, attended by 18,500 people, British executives and lobbyists representing industries from finance and technology to construction and defense crammed into bars, corridors and meeting rooms as Labour made its pitch to be "the undisputed party of business," in the words of Jonathan Reynolds, a lawmaker who speaks for Labour on the issue.
The record attendance was boosted by companies showing up for the first time, decamping from their more familiar habitat of Conservative Party gatherings, including Ineos, whose CEO and founder is the billionaire Brexit supporter Jim Ratcliffe.
Mr. Gardner said that Labour was already saying 80 percent of what he wanted to hear in terms of decarbonizing large-scale industry, as the company invests in reducing its carbon emissions. (That off-road vehicle was hydrogen-powered.) But he was there to push for the last portion, which was to lobby Labour not to end natural gas exploration in the North Sea too soon.
That message was "slowly percolating," he said. And there was some evidence that Ineos was being heard: Rachel Reeves, who would become Britain's first female chancellor if Labour win next year, mentioned Grangemouth in her speech to party members.
The party brought together about 200 executives on Monday at a forum within the conference to meet would-be cabinet ministers.
"What we are experiencing is a party who tell us that, if elected, they want to be business-friendly government, that they want to work with the private sector in partnership," said Chris Hayward, who speaks on policy questions for the City of London, Britain's historic financial district.
At a reception on Tuesday evening held by Labour Business, a forum to engage with the commercial sector, the mood was almost euphoric. As guests sipped wine and ate canapés, the group's chairman, Hamish Sandison, said that not only had the tide turned in terms of Labour's relationship with business, it had "become a tsunami."
That enthusiasm partly reflects strained relations with the governing Conservatives, particularly over Britain's exit from the European Union, which many big corporations opposed.
Boris Johnson, a former prime minister, famously dismissed the concerns of businesses over Brexit in crude terms. His short-lived successor, Liz Truss, caused markets chaos with her plans for unfunded tax cuts. And although her successor, Rishi Sunak, restored some calm, he has recently upset many businesses by abruptly changing targets on some net zero plans and canceling part of a high-speed train network.
Labour has been on a journey, too. Its previous leader, Jeremy Corbyn, promised nationalization of key industries and big increases in public spending funded by higher taxes. That agenda has been unceremoniously junked by Mr. Starmer, who became leader in 2020 and moved to purge his predecessor.
Labour's shift attracted some surprising names, like JCB Hydrogen, an energy firm, which handed out tote bags to party members. Its chairman, Anthony Bamford, was a prominent supporter of Brexit and, during the last general election in 2019, hosted a campaign event for Mr. Johnson.
What draws many businesses to Labour is the prospect of a more stable policy environment, which could be cemented by the party's plans for a long-term industrial strategy -- an idea that runs counter to Mr. Sunak's free-market instincts.
Carl Ennis, the head of Siemens in Britain and Ireland, was also at the Labour conference for the first time. He was there to lobby for an "overarching" and long-term approach, which was something that the Conservatives were struggling to provide, he said. "My job is to make the U.K. an attractive place for Siemens to invest its money in," he said, adding that Labour's industrial strategy appealed to him.
In every meeting room, businesses had the same central plea: Give us consistency. And the Labour party was receptive, said Shevaun Haviland, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. "We feel very positive that the party's listening to what we have to say and what our members have to say," she said.
Ben Wilson, vice president of public policy for Mastercard, said that his experience of engaging with the party was "indicative of how open Labour is to business," saying that he and other executives had the opportunity to discuss policies that could form part of the platform of the "next government."
All this has revived memories of the 1990s when, in the years before Tony Blair became prime minister, the party wooed business over lunches and dinners in what was nicknamed the "prawn cocktail offensive." This time much of the interaction has been over breakfast with Ms. Reeves, nicknamed the "scrambled eggs and smoked salmon offensive."
"Ever since I became shadow chancellor I've had this aim to reach out to business," Ms. Reeves, a former economist at the Bank of England, said at a small event on the sidelines of the conference. "A lot of the businesses that I've met over the last two and a half years would have seen, in some of the announcements this week, their fingerprints on our policies."
While some on the left of the party were unnerved by the dominant presence of business and its influence on future policy, other supporters suggested it was the inevitable result of Labour's double-digit poll lead.
"Businesses are here in numbers," said Stephen Kinsella, a former antitrust lawyer and Labour donor. "There are a lot of people who want to back a winner, think they have spotted a winner and realize they need to get to know the people who are going to be in government."

The Danger of Pulling Too Far Back From China: [Editorial]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/danger-pulling-too-far-back-china/docview/2867679467/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Many Americans, even once-ardent proponents of globalization, have soured on trade with China. But there is a growing danger that as the United States tries to address its difficulties with China, it will pull back too far, severing economic ties that benefit American families and contribute to global peace and prosperity.
The relationship problems are real, and cannot be minimized. Chinese industrial subsidies, often maintained despite promises to the contrary, stripped millions of jobs from America's industrial heartland. Chinese companies flagrantly steal American innovations. China's increasingly confrontational posture toward the United States and its allies -- including the economic support it is providing for Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- have underscored the need for the United States to align trade policy more closely with other aspects of America's national interest. In an example of the prevailing mood in Washington, Representative Mike Gallagher, the Wisconsin Republican who serves as the chairman of the pointedly named "Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party," recently called for broad prohibitions on U.S. investment in China, writing in an essay published in The Washington Post that "we are quite literally funding our own potential destruction."
A new rule book is needed. Too few leaders, however, appear willing to note that Americans also benefit from trade with China, that the two nations are economically intertwined whether they like it or not, and that it is in America's interest for the rest of the world to prosper. Americans bought almost $ 40 billion of Chinese toys, games and sports equipment last year. Soybean farmers in the Upper Midwest sold a record $ 16.4 billion of their beans to China, mostly for pig feed. Intel takes profits from low-end chips it makes and sells in China to fund the high-end chips it sells in America and to its allies. Hundreds of millions of Chinese have come out of poverty thanks to global trade, and have become consumers of U.S. goods and services. Cummins, an engine maker based in Indiana, operates 21 factories in China, and earns a fifth of its profits from its operations there. "Our success in China has led to global success and U.S. job growth," Jon Mills, a spokesman for the company, recently told the Times reporter Alexandra Stevenson.
Amid the harsh talk, the dollar value of American trade with China -- Americans buying Chinese products and the Chinese buying American products -- rose to a record in 2022. The goal of American policymakers ought to be safeguarding the vast majority of those trade flows while addressing the problems that have emerged.
The Biden administration's top priority in its dealings with China is, as it should be, national security. The president has emphasized the need to limit China's access to advanced technologies with military applications. An executive order recently signed by Mr. Biden that restricts American investment in Chinese firms that work on artificial intelligence, semiconductors and quantum computing is a measured and necessary intervention. The government's push to provide subsidies for the domestic production of semiconductors is also a sensible policy. The United States needs to secure reliable access to critical materials.
Hawkish politicians from both parties and American companies that stand to gain from protectionist policies, however, are pushing for a broader retreat from trade with China. Donald Trump, whose dim view of trade helped to propel his successful presidential candidacy in 2016, and who is again the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, is promising to "tax China to build up America." After the Biden administration suspended tariffs on some Chinese solar panels to accelerate America's conversion to renewable energy, Senate Democrats and Republicans joined in a vote to reimpose the tariffs. "This vote was a simple choice: Do you stand with American manufacturers and American workers, or do you stand with China?" said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. Mr. Gallagher's committee, with bipartisan support, has been investigating whether U.S. financial giants like BlackRock and MSCI invested in blacklisted Chinese firms, a warning shot aimed at Wall Street.
The Biden administration describes its approach to trade limitations as "small yard, high fence," meaning that it is aiming to restrict China's access to a small number of advanced technologies. But some strictures on trade, notably the broad tariffs on Chinese imports first introduced by Mr. Trump and maintained by President Biden, already go too far, imposing costs on American households without much benefit to them or national security.
Keeping the yard from getting bigger is also likely to prove difficult. During Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo's recent visit to China, the country's leading mobile phone manufacturer, Huawei, provocatively released a new smartphone powered by an advanced chip made in China most likely using American technology and machinery. A group of House Republicans sent a letter to the Biden administration citing the phone's release as evidence of the need for tighter restrictions on China's access to advanced chips. But China's ability to make serviceable smartphones does not threaten America's national security. Restraint is the best policy here. The United States has a legitimate interest in limiting China's access to military technology, not in preventing the Chinese from checking email.
And while high walls are sometimes essential, so too are broad bridges. It is important to create real penalties for bad behavior by China, but it is also important to reward good behavior. Just as in the United States, there is a debate inside China between trade hard-liners and reformers. America has natural allies among those in China who understand that Beijing has to change and can succeed by playing by the rules.
Defending trade is politically fraught in part because so many American leaders underestimated the impact of China's rise on American workers and failed to ensure that the benefits were broadly shared.
That failure has changed Americans' views of how our country relates to the rest of the world. A recent study reports that younger Americans are more skeptical than previous generations that trade is mutually beneficial for participating nations, part of a broader turn toward zero-sum thinking -- the belief that gains for one group tend to come at someone else's expense. The authors argue that the outlook of older generations was shaped by an era of higher growth, in which it seemed plausible that everyone's boat would rise. Younger generations, by contrast, have been embittered, and policymakers can rebuild support for trade only by addressing those past failures.
The United States can do that by pursuing economic relationships with the world that include protections for the environment and for workers. Other nations will continue to provide industrial subsidies, and the United States can use similar policies to develop new industries, like the renewable energy sector. "We're retaking control of our energy security and our energy future," Ali Zaidi, Mr. Biden's climate adviser, said in an interview with The Times's editorial board. At the same time, America should continue to pursue deeper economic ties with allied nations, as in a recent agreement to allow electric vehicle batteries made with minerals from Japan to qualify for U.S. tax credits.
American engagement with China is complicated by China's contradictions. The country remains eager for access to advanced technologies and global markets, but resists giving reciprocal access to its own markets. In recent months, even as China has ended pandemic restrictions and made a show of reopening its doors, it has made life difficult for foreign firms, with raids on corporate offices, for instance. Some measures, like the refusal of Chinese antitrust authorities to let the American chip maker Intel buy the Israeli chip maker Tower, appear to be responses to U.S. restrictions. But longstanding grievances remain unresolved. It has been 22 years since China promised to let Visa and Mastercard operate on equal terms, and 11 years since the W.T.O. ruled that China wasn't keeping that promise, yet the companies still are struggling for access.
The best reason for optimism is that the two nations still depend on each other. China's recent struggles -- slowing growth, an imploding housing sector, high youth unemployment and capital flight -- appear to be motivating a more open stance among Chinese policymakers. And after a period of escalating tensions, the Biden administration also has sought to calm the waters by sending a series of senior officials to the country. In recent years, Chinese airlines have largely refrained from placing new orders for Boeing airplanes, making a political point of buying jets from Airbus, its European rival. But Guillaume Faury, the Airbus chief executive, predicted in a recent interview that the trend would not continue. "I don't believe that China can rely on one aircraft manufacturer," he said. "They need competition." The first narrow-body jets produced by a Chinese company, Comac, entered commercial service earlier this year. The engines were manufactured in Durham, N.C.
The steadily rising trade between the United States and China from 1979 to the present has disrupted the lives of many Americans and caused real harm to some. That said, in the sweep of history those four decades were an era of remarkable peace between, and prosperity for, the two countries.
Some U.S. politicians want to take advantage of China's dependence to constrain its economic development by denying China the technologies that it needs. The better course is to focus on limiting the reach of China's military, not its economy as a whole. China sees that it cannot isolate itself from the world; this is not the time for the United States to do so, either.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gina Raimondo, the U.S. commerce secretary, and her Chinese counterparts agreed to continue economic talks, but such dialogues have a disheartening record.
When Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, visited China this week, she joined a long line of U.S. politicians who have come to the country to try to sway Chinese officials to open their market to foreign businesses and buy more American exports, in addition to other goals.
Ms. Raimondo left Shanghai on Wednesday night with no concrete commitments from China to treat foreign businesses more equitably or step up purchases of Boeing jets, Iowa corn or other products. In a farewell news conference, she said that hoping for such an outcome would have been unrealistic.
Instead, Ms. Raimondo said her biggest accomplishment was restoring lines of communication with China that would reduce the chance of miscalculation between the world's two largest economies. She and Chinese officials agreed during the trip to create new dialogues between the countries, including a working group for commercial issues that American businesses had urged her to set up.
"The greatest thing accomplished on both sides is a commitment to communicate more," Ms. Raimondo said on Wednesday.
She had also delivered what she described as a tough message. The Biden administration was willing to work to promote trade with China for many categories of goods. But the administration was not going to heed China's biggest request: that the United States reduce stringent controls on exports of the most advanced semiconductors and the equipment to make them.
"We don't negotiate on matters of national security," Ms. Raimondo told reporters during her visit.
While she called the trip "an excellent start," the big question is where it will lead. There is a long history of frustrating and unproductive economic dialogues between the United States and China, and there are not many reasons to believe this time will prove different.
Forums for discussion may have helped resolve some individual business complaints, but they did not reverse a broad, yearslong slide toward more conflict in the bilateral relationship. Now, the U.S.-China relationship faces a variety of significant security and economic issues, including China's more aggressive posture abroad, its use of U.S. technology to advance its military and its recent raids on foreign-owned businesses.
Ms. Raimondo says she has the backing of the president and U.S. officials. And Biden administration officials argue that even the shift to begin talking has been significant, after a particularly tense period. Relations between the United States and China became frosty last August when Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker at the time, visited Taiwan, and they froze entirely after a Chinese surveillance balloon flew across the United States in February.
Ms. Raimondo's trip capped a summer of outreach by four senior Biden officials. R. Nicholas Burns, the U.S. ambassador to China, who took office in January 2022 and accompanied Ms. Raimondo on the trip, said on Tuesday that American officials "literally were not talking to the Chinese leadership at a senior level, my first 15 months here."
"In a very, very challenging relationship, intensive diplomacy is critical," he added.
Not everyone views re-engagement as a good thing. Republican lawmakers, in particular, increasingly see the conflict between the United States and China as a fundamental clash of national interests. Critics view the outreach as an invitation for China to drag out reforms, or a signal to Beijing that the United States is willing to make concessions.
"Of the more than two dozen great-power rivalries over the past 200 years, none ended with the sides talking their way out of trouble," Michael Beckley, an associate professor of political science at Tufts University, wrote in Foreign Affairs this month. He added, "The bottom line is that great-power rivalries cannot be papered over with memorandums of understanding."
The space for compromise also seems narrow. Both governments have little desire to be seen by domestic audiences as making concessions. And in both countries, the share of trade that is considered off limits or a matter of national security concerns is growing.
Ms. Raimondo expressed wariness at being drawn into unproductive talks with China -- a persistent issue over the last several decades. But she also described herself as a pragmatist, who would push to accomplish what she could and not waste time on the rest.
"I don't want to return to the days of dialogue for dialogue's sake," she said. "That being said, nothing good comes from shutting down communication. What comes from lack of communication is mis-assessment, miscalculation and increased risk."
"We have to make it different," Ms. Raimondo said of her new dialogue, adding that the U.S.-China relationship was too consequential. "We have to commit ourselves to take some action. And we can't allow ourselves to devolve into a cynical place."
Kurt Tong, a former U.S. consul general in Hong Kong who is now a managing partner at the Asia Group, a Washington consulting firm, said Ms. Raimondo had offered China half of what it wanted. She sent a clear message that many American companies should feel free to do business in China, after years of receiving criticism for doing so during the Trump administration and still from many Republicans in Congress. But she did not agree to relax American export controls.
"China is essentially forced by circumstances to accept that half a loaf," Mr. Tong said, adding, "I do sense there is a real desire in Beijing to stabilize the relationship, both because of the geopolitical relationship but also, perhaps more important, the doldrums on the economic side."
The recent weakness in the Chinese economy may create some opening for compromise. The Chinese economy has only limped back from its pandemic lockdowns. China's youth unemployment rate has risen, its debt is piling up, and foreign investment in the country has fallen, as multinational companies look for other places to set up their factories.
In a meeting with Ms. Raimondo on Wednesday, the Shanghai party secretary, Chen Jining, admitted that the sluggish economy made business ties more crucial.
"The business and trade ties serve the role as stabilizing ballast for the bilateral ties," Mr. Chen said. "However, the world today is quite complicated. The economic rebound is a bit lackluster. So stable bilateral ties in terms of trade and business is in the interest of two countries and is also called for by the world community."
Ms. Raimondo responded that she was looking forward to discussing "concrete" ways they might be able to work together to accomplish business goals and "to bring about a more predictable business environment, a predictable regulatory environment and a level playing field for American businesses here in Shanghai."
Some of the issues that Ms. Raimondo raised during her visit -- including intellectual property theft, patent protection and the inability of Visa and Mastercard to receive final approval for access to the Chinese market -- are the very same ones that were discussed in economic dialogues with China more than a decade ago, including under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.
For instance, China promised in 2001 as part of its entry into the World Trade Organization that it would quickly allow American credit card companies into its market, and it lost a W.T.O. case on the issue in 2012. But 22 years later, Visa and Mastercard still do not have equal access to the Chinese market.
For more than three decades, commerce secretary visits to China followed a familiar script. The visiting American official would call on China to open its markets to more American investment, and to allow more equal competition among foreign and local companies. Then the commerce secretary would attend the signing of contracts for exports to China.
That included Barbara H. Franklin, who in 1992, at the end of the George H.W. Bush administration, oversaw the signing of $ 1 billion in contracts and the re-establishment of commercial relations with China after the deadly Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.
Gary Locke of the Obama administration oversaw the signing of a broad contract in 2009 for the provision of American construction services. And Wilbur Ross, who went to China on behalf of President Donald J. Trump in 2017, came back with $ 250 billion in deals for everything from smartphone components to helicopters to Boeing jets.
These deals did little to erase China's enormous trade imbalance with the United States. China has fairly consistently sold $ 3 to $ 4 a year worth of goods to the United States for each dollar of goods that it purchased.
In a sign of how much the focus of the relationship has shifted, Ms. Raimondo's trip contained more discussion of national security than of new contracts. She gave her final news conference in a hangar at Shanghai Pudong Airport near two Boeing 737-800s, but did not mention the contract for several Boeings that China has yet to accept, much less any new sales.
China, the world's largest single market for new jetliners in recent years, essentially stopped buying Boeing jets during the Biden administration and switched to Airbus planes from Europe to show its unhappiness with American policies. Ms. Raimondo said on Tuesday that she had raised the lapse of Boeing purchases with Chinese leaders during her two days in Beijing.
"I brought up all those companies," Ms. Raimondo said. "I didn't receive any commitments. I was very firm in our expectations. I think I was heard. And as I said, we'll have to see if they take any action."

Raimondo Heads to China To Push Trade, and Curb It: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The commerce secretary's trip may be the clearest demonstration yet of the balancing act the Biden administration is trying to pull off in its relations with China.
Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, is heading to China on Saturday with two seemingly contradictory responsibilities: a mandate to strengthen U.S. business relations with Beijing while also imposing some of the toughest Chinese trade restrictions in years.
The head of the Commerce Department is traditionally the government's biggest champion for the business community both at home and abroad, promoting the kind of extensive ties U.S. firms have with China, the world's second-largest economy.
But U.S.-China relations have turned chillier as China has become more aggressive in flexing its economic and military might. While China remains an important economic partner, American officials have increasingly viewed the country as a security threat and have imposed a raft of new restrictions aimed at crippling Beijing's access to technology that could be used to strengthen the Chinese military or security services.
The bulk of those restrictions -- which have stoked anger and irritation from the Chinese government -- have been imposed by Ms. Raimondo's agency.
The Commerce Department has issued extensive trade restrictions on sales of chips, software and machinery to China's semiconductor industry and is mulling an expansion of those rules that could be issued soon after Ms. Raimondo returns to Washington.
Her visit could be the biggest test yet of whether the Biden administration can pull off the balancing act of promoting economic ties with China while clamping down on some trade in the interest of national security.
Ms. Raimondo will be the fourth administration official to travel to China in recent months, following John Kerry, the president's special envoy for climate change; Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen; and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken.
Ms. Raimondo is expected to reiterate what her counterparts have told Chinese officials: that there is no contradiction between the administration's goals for encouraging commercial engagement with China and protecting U.S. national security. They argue that the United States can maintain economic ties with China that benefit both countries and encourage peace, while also setting narrow but tough restrictions on China's access to advanced technology in the interest of national defense.
But the approach faces skepticism in both countries. In the United States, some Republicans argue that even more innocuous business ties with China could undercut U.S. industries and leave the nation vulnerable to influence from Beijing. And in China, many view what the U.S. government describes as narrow, national-security-related actions as a poorly disguised effort to hold back the Chinese economy.
"I think the Commerce Department has tried to be very targeted," said Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center. "Now, the Chinese side won't see it that way."
For Chinese officials, Ms. Raimondo simultaneously represents some of their best opportunities for engagement with the United States and their biggest source of frustration.
Experts say her visit presents a chance for Chinese leaders to strengthen trade relations and signal that their country is still open to international business at a moment when the Chinese economy has stumbled, foreign investment has declined and a series of raids on companies with foreign ties have set executives on edge.
But Chinese officials have also harshly criticized the technology curbs issued by her department, a condemnation they are likely to repeat in the week ahead. Officials in Beijing have also been highly critical of the new restrictions on American investment in certain high-tech Chinese industries, which the Biden administration proposed earlier this month.
At a summit in South Africa this week, a Chinese official delivered a prepared statement from Chinese leader Xi Jinping that called for the world to avoid "the abyss of a new Cold War" and blamed "some country, obsessed with maintaining its hegemony" for working to cripple emerging markets and developing countries.
In addition to export controls, Ms. Raimondo is overseeing the distribution of $ 50 billion to chip companies that build facilities in the United States. Any company that accepts that funding must agree not to build new factories for making advanced chips in China for at least a decade.
"The Biden administration is probing for a way to engage the Chinese in a very difficult environment," said Myron Brilliant, a senior counselor at Dentons Global Advisors-ASG who was formerly the executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "It's a balancing act for sure, between the national security agenda they are enforcing, while also recognizing that a lot of trade between the countries doesn't touch on national security considerations and should therefore not be restricted."
Ms. Raimondo is set to meet with high-level Chinese officials and representatives of American businesses in Beijing and Shanghai between Monday and Wednesday. People familiar with the government's planning say those talks may result in the creation of working groups to discuss export controls and commercial issues that arise between China and the United States.
American businesses are also hoping that the Biden administration will push for additional intellectual property protections for pharmaceutical companies, more access to the Chinese market for Visa and Mastercard and the completion of a longstanding Chinese order of Boeing airplanes, among other goals, people familiar with the talks said.
But those gains, while important for American firms, would still seem trivial compared with the mounting pressures U.S. companies can now face in China.
China's sputtering economy and harsh lockdowns during the pandemic are giving pause to businesses considering their presence in the country. The Chinese government has also restricted companies sending data from China abroad, making it more difficult for multinationals to do business.
Chinese authorities have responded to increasing technology restrictions from the United States by barring the U.S. chip-maker Micron from sales to companies that handle critical Chinese information and by scuttling a proposed merger between Intel and an Israeli chip-maker with operations in China. And companies exporting from China still face nearly the full suite of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, in addition to the new export controls.
The Biden administration has acknowledged the tensions in the U.S.-China relationship, saying that China poses a threat to U.S. national security but that it is still one of the country's most integral economic partners.
"This isn't about, you know, holding China back or denying them commodity technology," Ms. Raimondo said of the export controls at an event at the American Enterprise Institute in July. "Certainly not about denying U.S. companies revenue. It's about being honest about the fact that China has a military civil fusion strategy, which includes getting our most sophisticated technology and using it to advance their military. And we're not going to allow that."
The United States has for decades imposed export controls on the types of technology that can be sent to China, including restricting sales of satellites and other technology following Beijing's crackdown in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
But limits on technology trade with China have increased substantially in recent years, since the Trump administration imposed restrictions on the Chinese telecom firm Huawei. In October, the Biden administration expanded the limits to all firms using advanced chips in China.
Chip firms, which earn a third or more of their global revenue through sales to China, have also pushed back, saying that the new restrictions are resulting in less money to invest in new research and innovation.In July, the chief executives of Nvidia, Qualcomm and Intel met with Ms. Raimondo in Washington to make that case.
It's not clear how much influence, if any, their lobbying will have on the rules. Ms. Raimondo, a former venture capitalist and governor of Rhode Island, has a long reputation as a business-friendly and pragmatic political actor. But as commerce secretary, she has repeatedly argued that the United States could not compromise on issues of national security.
"We are not seeking the decoupling of our economy from that of China's," Ms. Raimondo said in a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in November. "We want to continue to promote trade and investment in those areas that do not undermine our interests or values."

Credit Card Fees Raise Expenses and Hackles: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As inflation and high credit card fees continue to affect a restaurant's bottom line, more owners are tacking on a new charge for using a credit card.
Last year, when food prices rose along with so many other costs, José Theoktisto began to think about how to lower operating expenses at the Venezuelan restaurant he runs in upstate New York. He worked with different suppliers, and he raised menu prices. Then he took a closer look at his statements and found that he was paying $ 2,000 a month in credit card fees.
"They pile fees on top of fees, on top of fees," Mr. Theoktisto said about credit card processing companies. He said that he normally pays 4 percent per transaction when someone uses an electronic payment method, but that he also has to cover other charges related to credit cards, like a fee for when a customer uses a card from another country.
In January, he decided that instead of raising prices, he would add a 4 percent convenience fee to the bills of customers who pay by credit card. He is just one of an increasing number of restaurant owners adopting these policies as inflation cuts into his bottom line and credit card fees rise.
Mr. Theoktisto said that since he and his wife opened Oh Corn! Arepas about seven years ago near Troy, N.Y., the number of customers using electronic payments has increased from 50 percent to 90 percent. He is not alone.
"No one's using cash," said John Horne, the owner of Café L'Europe and several locations of the Anna Maria Oyster Bar in Sarasota, Fla. He said he has paid about $ 279,000 in credit card fees this year among his six restaurants, and is thinking about adding a broader service fee. "It is increasing the cost of doing business in every industry. And the consumer doesn't realize it."
For many diners, though, the restaurant check is starting to resemble a CVS receipt. The credit card fee charge can come on top of the tip and various service charges that many restaurants now impose on customers. Michael Thompson, who owns a restaurant, a food truck and a truck stop in Klamath Falls, Ore., said he recently ate with his wife at a Mexican restaurant downtown and found a 3.8 percent credit card fee on his bill.
"It really bothered me," Mr. Thompson said. "I'll never go back." He said he'd never charge these fees at his establishments.
In 2021, Iris Rodriguez noticed the credit card fee increases when she reopened her Puerto Rican seafood restaurant, CostaMar, in Killeen, Texas, after closing it down during the pandemic. In April, she realized she was paying about $ 400 more each month for electronic payment charges. It was getting more difficult for her to make a profit. In May, she added a nearly 4 percent convenience fee for customers paying with a card.
"We're being crushed with everything," Ms. Rodriguez said, adding that she had absorbed the card-company fees before the pandemic because they were more manageable and because food costs were lower.
Restaurants are known to have very small profit margins, about 3 to 5 percent, said Sean Kennedy, the executive vice president of public affairs at the National Restaurant Association, an organization that lobbies on behalf of restaurant owners.
Inflation has made it difficult for restaurants to manage their costs, and they can risk losing customers if they raise prices, Mr. Kennedy said. The association has found that credit card fees are the third-highest expense for restaurants, behind food and labor costs. Owners have also lost the ability to negotiate their rates with credit card companies, he said, because Visa and Mastercard control about 80 percent of the market, and fees continue to increase.
"It's a perfect storm affecting an industry that's barely profitable on a good day," Mr. Kennedy said. "At the end of the day, these surcharges are not about greed, they're about survival for restaurant owners."
The association supports the Credit Card Competition Act, a bill introduced in June by Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois that would require banks to work with smaller networks, other than Visa and Mastercard, to process these fees. Merchants would then have the option to pick a network with a smaller fee, which could then drive down such charges as more competition is inserted into the market, according to aides from Senator Durbin's office.
Restaurants who work with a credit card processing company typically receive a point-of-sale system and terminal, which manages their reservations and online orders. This allows restaurant owners to expand their business, said Jeffrey Tassey, the chairman of the Electronic Payments Coalition, an organization that represents major credit card companies.
He said there are more costs associated with accepting cash, like the workers who have to count it and give change. He also encouraged restaurateurs to shop around for the best rates if they felt they were paying too much.
Even though Amy Warner pays 8.5 percent per credit card transaction for the customers at the Trempealeau Hotel in Trempealeau, Wis., she said she worries about having to close her business for days to switch the processing system she has had for about 20 years so that she could obtain a lower rate. She was shocked when her July statement showed that she had paid more than $ 6,000 in credit card fees.
This month, she plans to add a 5 percent convenience fee because she can no longer raise the prices on her restaurant's farm-to-table menu. She doesn't want to price out the locals.
"I could have a full member on salary with insurance benefits on staff with what I'm paying in these fees," she said. "It kills you."

Mastercard Moves to Block the Use of Debit Cards at Cannabis Shops: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The decision places more strain on the cannabis industry, which largely operates with cash and is not uniformly regulated across the United States. The drug is still illegal on the federal level.
Mastercard instructed U.S. financial institutions this week to stop allowing purchases of cannabis on its debit cards, stripping customers of a convenient way to purchase marijuana without cash. Cannabis businesses say the decision will increase the risk of robbery and violent crime.
Because federal law prohibits the sale, possession and use of marijuana in all its forms, Mastercard said that purchases were not allowed on its systems, even when customers use bank cards and PINs to access their own cash to buy cannabis in states where the drug is legal for recreational or medical reasons.
"As we were made aware of this matter, we quickly investigated it," a spokesman for Mastercard, one of the world's largest payment processors, said in a statement on Friday. "In accordance with our policies, we instructed the financial institutions that offer payments services to cannabis merchants and connects them to Mastercard to terminate the activity."
Medical marijuana is legal in 38 states, three territories and the District of Columbia. Recreational use of the drug is legal in 23 states, two territories and the District of Columbia.
Because most big banks and credit card providers will not work with marijuana businesses, many operate by cash only, making them targets for a growing number of robberies, particularly when transporting large amounts of cash for deposit.
Despite the hurdles with banks, the cannabis boom continues to help local economies thrive, proponents of legalization say. National sales could exceed $ 57 billion annually by 2030 just from states where such sales are permitted, Quartz reported. When states that are poised to legalize it are factored in, the national forecast exceeds $ 72 billion in sales.
Cannabis companies have begun criticizing Mastercard's decision, some raising concerns about safety.
Morgan Paxhia, a co-founder of Poseidon Investment Management, which oversees AdvisorShares Poseidon Dynamic Cannabis, said in an interview on Friday that small stores might not have the financial resources to fight against crime. Once taxes are paid, he said, "there's really not a lot of cash left for, you know, for just operating expenses like security. And so, that's where I see a disproportionate impact on the smaller businesses in this industry."
Mr. Paxhia said Mastercard's decision was a "painful" example of the federal government being unwilling to recognize cannabis as an industry. "We've also seen this over the years where a payment solution starts to take shape in our industry and then they get shut down," he said. "It's really because we have not seen federal laws changed that gives the banking industry confidence to bank." He expects Visa to follow in Mastercard's footsteps soon.
Darren Weiss, the president of Verano, a multistate marijuana operator, said on social media that it "never ceases to amaze me that an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people, provides billions in economic benefits, and promotes safer alternatives to pharmaceuticals and commonplace vices continues to be treated like a pariah."
Paul Armentano, the deputy director of NORML, an organization that works to change public opinion in favor of legalization, said in a statement on Friday that no industry can operate safely, transparently or effectively without access to banks.
"Ultimately, Congress must amend federal policy," he said, "so that these growing numbers of state-compliant businesses and those millions of Americans who patronize them, are no longer subject to policies that undermine their ability to conduct transactions safely and effectively."
Going cashless has not been easy. In 2017, Hawaii became the first state in the nation to have a cashless dispensary system with the use of the payment app CanPay. The app can be used for cannabis transactions in a handful of other states, including California and Colorado, The Associated Press reported.
More recently, Congress has been evaluating the proposed Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act, or SAFE Act, which would legalize marijuana banking by stipulating that the proceeds of a state-sanctioned marijuana business would not be considered illegal under federal laws against money laundering.
The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs held its first hearing on the measure in May. In his opening remarks, Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, noted that the Justice Department was concerned that the bill "could create loopholes in our money-laundering laws, making it harder to catch criminals that traffic weapons, fentanyl and even people."
But the senator, a former small business owner, said he also understood the importance of having a relationship with a financial institution. "A banking relationship is crucial to providing safety and stability for a company," he said, "both employees and the customers it serves."

G.O.P. Candidate Offers $20 Gift Cards for $1 Donations: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The candidate, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, is one of several Republican presidential candidates going to great lengths to reach a crucial threshold to qualify for the first primary debate.
How much is a dollar worth?
To Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, quite a lot.
Mr. Burgum is one of several Republican presidential candidates going to great lengths to reach a crucial threshold to qualify for the party's first primary debate on Aug. 23 -- the requirement that only candidates with at least 40,000 individual donors to their campaigns will be allowed on the stage.
A long-shot contender at the bottom of recent polls, Mr. Burgum is offering $ 20 gift cards to the first 50,000 people who donate at least $ 1 to his campaign. And one lucky donor, as his campaign advertised on Facebook, will have the chance to win a Yeti Tundra 45 cooler that typically costs more than $ 300 -- just for donating at least $ 1. The unusual offer was earlier reported by FWIW, a newsletter that tracks digital politics.
Mr. Burgum's push to prioritize donors over actual dollars is a sign of some candidates' desperation to make the debate stage and to seize some of the national spotlight from the Republican front-runner, former President Donald J. Trump, and his top rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.
Former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, another Republican candidate, recently ended a campaign ad with a direct plea that flashed on the screen to "Donate today, get Chris Christie on the debate stage."
Mr. Burgum's campaign acknowledged that its requests were directly tied to the debate and spun the gift-card giveaways into attacks on President Biden.
"Doug knows people are hurting because of Bidenflation, and giving Biden Economic Relief Gift Cards is a way to help 50,000 people until Doug is elected President to fix this crazy economy for everyone," said Lance Trover, a spokesman for the Burgum campaign.
Mr. Trover added that the efforts allowed the campaign to "secure a spot on the debate stage while avoiding paying more advertising fees to social media platforms who have owners that are hostile to conservatives."
Kyle Tharp, the author of the FWIW newsletter that reported on the solicitations, said that as part of his reporting process, he had donated $ 1 to the Burgum campaign. He did not receive any follow-up information about how he would receive the gift card, he said. The campaign later clarified on Twitter that 50,000 donors would receive a Visa or Mastercard gift card to their mailing address.
The campaign did not respond to a request for comment about how many donors had contributed so far.
The campaign's donations-for-cash strategy could raise potential legal concerns, said Paul Ryan, a campaign finance lawyer. Voters who make donations in exchange for gift cards, he said, might be considered straw donors because part or all of their donations are being reimbursed by the campaign.
"Federal law says 'no person shall make a contribution in the name of another person,"' Mr. Ryan said. "Here, the candidate is making a contribution to himself in the name of all these individual donors."
Richard L. Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in election law, said that typically, campaigns ask the Federal Election Commission when engaging in new forms of donations.
The Burgum campaign's maneuver, he said, "certainly seems novel" and "raises concerns about whether it violates the prohibition on straw donations."
But some of the legal uncertainty, Mr. Hasen added, stems from the fact that "functionally, campaigns spend a lot of money to get small donations, especially in cases like this where they're trying to reach a debate threshold."
Mr. Burgum isn't alone in using his immense wealth -- he's a billionaire former software executive -- to bolster his campaign.
Perry Johnson, a businessman who also announced a hopeful bid for the Republican presidential nomination and who ran for Michigan governor last year, has spent $ 80,000 to $ 90,000 on ads promoting $ 1 hats that read, "I identify as 'Non-Bidenary,"' Facebook records show. His campaign said in a recent ad that it had reached 10,000 donors.
To qualify for the first presidential debate, candidates must have a minimum of 200 unique donors per state or territory in 20 states and territories, according to the Republican National Committee, which set the rules. They must also garner at least 1 percent in multiple national or early-voting state polls recognized by the committee.

Toys Inspired By 'Baby Shark' Are Recalled After Injuries: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: At least a dozen people have reported being injured by the toy. The top fins pose a risk of "impalement, lacerations and punctures," the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said.
About 7.5 million Baby Shark bath toys are being recalled after reports that at least a dozen children were injured by them, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Thursday.
Both the full-size and mini versions of the toy are included in the voluntary recall, which the commission and Zuru, a toymaker based in El Segundo, Calif., announced after complaints that children had been falling on or sitting on the full-size toy's plastic top fin.
The top fins on the shark toys pose a risk of "impalement, lacerations and punctures," the commission said. About nine of the 12 reported injuries required medical attention or stitches, according to the federal agency.
The commission and Zuru urged customers to stop using the recalled toys.
The toymaker said in a statement that it was working with retail partners to "remove and destroy" the products.
Both full-size Robo Alive Junior Baby Shark Sing & Swim bath toys and Mini Baby Shark Swimming bath toys were recalled. They came in blue, yellow and pink. The full-size version sings when placed in water; the mini version does not.
The full-size toys that were recalled were sold from May 2019 to March 2023. The mini toys were sold from July 2020 to June 2023.
Walmart, CVS Pharmacy, Family Dollar and Target are among the major retailers that sold the toys. Several online retailers sold the them as well.
A refund is available for those who cut off the fin, write "recalled" on the shark and upload a photo of it online. Directions are available on the toy manufacturer's website.
Consumers will receive a full refund of $ 14 for each full-size toy and $ 6 for each mini toy in the form of a prepaid virtual Mastercard.
Consumers can look for the model number #25282 and a date code beginning with the letters "DG" followed by "YYYY/MM/DD" in the date range DG20190501 through DG20220619 to determine if they have the full-size recalled sharks.
For the mini recalled sharks, the model numbers will be #7163, #7175, #7166 or #25291 and the toys will have a date code between DG2020615 and DG2023525.

Business Confidence
In China Is Plunging
Foreign companies are shifting investments and their Asian headquarters out of China as confidence plunges following the expansion of an anti-spying law and other challenges, a business group said Wednesday.
The report by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China adds is one of many signs of growing pessimism despite the ruling Communist Party's efforts to revive interest in the world's No. 2 economy following the end of anti-virus controls.
Companies are uneasy about security controls, government protection of their Chinese rivals and a lack of action on reform promises, according to the European Chamber. They also are being squeezed by slowing Chinese economic growth and rising costs.
Business confidence in China is "pretty much the lowest we have on record," the European Chamber president, Jens Eskelund, told reporters ahead of the report's release. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Mastercard Is Starting
To Recycle Credit Cards
Mastercard on Wednesday launched a global project to recycle credit and debit cards as part of a plan to save the billions of cards in circulation across the industry from landfill.
Initially teaming up with HSBC in eight bank branches in Britain, Mastercard said banks across the world, some of which have started local initiatives, would be able to join the program and help build economies of scale.
"We are inviting all card issuers around the world to partner with us, no matter what region they are in, and offer card recycling to their customers," said Ajay Bhalla, president of cyber and intelligence at Mastercard.
Under the plan, Mastercard will provide shredding machines to HSBC, each of which is capable of holding 10,000 cards, equivalent to 110 pounds of plastic. Once full, it will be transferred to a plastic recycling facility.
Financial details about the plan were not disclosed. The pilot project, which will run for an initial six months, will allow customers to recycle any plastic card, including those from rivals.

TAXATION
I.R.S. Has Reduced Its Backlog by 80%
The I.R.S. has processed tens of millions of tax returns faster this year compared with past years while getting through to customer service on the phone is slowly improving, according to a report to Congress released on Wednesday.
The latest update on the Internal Revenue Service from the National Taxpayer Advocate, Erin M. Collins, said that the agency cut its backlog of unprocessed paper tax returns by 80 percent, from 13.3 million returns at the end of the 2022 filing season to 2.6 million at the end of the 2023 filing season.
And now 35 percent of calls are answered, compared with 11 percent before.
"Overall, the difference between the 2022 filing season and the 2023 filing season was like night and day," Ms. Collins said. "It marks a return to prepandemic levels."

My Father Taught Me the Benefits of a Little Delusion: [Op-Ed]

Full text: In 2015, at the height of my father's homelessness, he took me on vacation. By "height," I mean shelters were a thing of the past. He was living on the street and didn't have a car, so we took mine. The hot, white Florida sun ran along the corner of the windshield as we drove in a loop around Fort Myers Beach.
Dad knew which meters were out of service, so we parked for free. From the back seat he grabbed two heavy-duty garbage bags stuffed with his life belongings.
In the lobby of the Lani Kai Island Resort, in line for check-in, I watched the lady behind the counter eye me, Dad, the garbage bags. Unabashed in her staring, I wondered if she was going to come up with a reason not to give us a room.
Anticipating an embarrassing moment, I turned my back to her and pretended to admire the tropical wallpaper. This was a common behavior of mine when in public with my father. Acting oblivious to shameful interactions was a courtesy I began extending to my father in my late teens, when his credit cards were declined at restaurants. By that point, at the age of 38, I had perfected it.
When Dad's prepaid credit card went through, I could've fainted from relief. After a quick high-five in the elevator, we tossed our bags in the room and headed to the sun deck for happy hour. In an instant, my father wasn't homeless. He was just another dad in his swimming trunks, flashing his gin and tonic to the waiter: Keep 'em comin'.
For most of my life, my father's philosophy was that no matter how unstable, life was meant to be celebrated. This struck me as profoundly Floridian, the existential equivalent of a hurricane party.
When I was growing up, my father sold cars. The stress of supporting a family of four on a commission-based sales job, compounded by long, erratic work hours, exploitative management and Dad's maverick style (he once punched his boss for raising the sales target after lunch), created instability in our home. My father job-hopped, which led to substantial credit card debt, and all the fights and drinking that went along with it. But Dad managed to juggle the debts and loans in such a way that we never went without.
The first thing Dad did when he got fired or quit was take us on a family vacation. They were never planned. He would walk in the door carrying his box of personal belongings from the dealership and, next thing we knew, we were off to Key West, Key Largo, Islamorada, Siesta Key. Bahamian resorts with water slides and welcome snorkels where my sister and I swam with dolphins. Our suites had groomed lawns and tennis courts, Jacuzzi baths and silver buckets of iced champagne. Dad would pop the cork so that it ricocheted off the ceiling and bounced off the wall. My sister and I would search for it, and he'd give $ 100 to whoever found it first.
As Dad got older and the impact of his choices grew more dire, he kept his Floridian mind-set alive. Following the disintegration of his 37-year marriage to my mother, he treated himself to two months on Paradise Island, where he traveled strictly by WaveRunner. When he blew through his 401(k), he got right to work on his new retirement plan: the Florida Lottery.
During the Great Recession, Dad lost his job at Plattner Automotive. He assumed he'd get "scooped up" by another dealership, just like he always did. But that's not what happened. The economy was in ruins. He had two mortgages on one house. Plus, he was 69 years old.
In the long, hot months leading up to the foreclosure of his home, windows covered with bedsheets to keep debt collectors from peeking inside, Dad blasted Shania Twain and sunbathed on the chaise longue beside the pool. It had once been a perfect turquoise with a hot tub and a swim-up bar, and now it was green. I was there to help him pack and was reminded of the first house we rented in Florida, in 1984. It, too, had a furry green pool. Whoever lived there before us didn't have the money for chlorine and upkeep. And now, all these years later, Dad didn't either.
Somewhere along the way, I inherited Dad's philosophy. However, I no longer consider this thinking to be Floridian. A friend of mine gave it a new name: adaptive delusion.
It's why I happily, eagerly took out $ 120,000 in student loans to get an M.F.A. at Columbia. It's why I spend months working on essays and book proposals that may never sell. After all, writing isn't really a profession. It's a casino. It's why I think "No problem!" when my credit score drops from 650 to 632 to 619. Adaptive delusion allows me to believe I can survive on as little as I do (last year: $ 47,864), which in turn allows me to be a writer and a single mother in Manhattan.
In times of housing insecurity and economic precarity, adaptive delusion is a godsend. Because buried in delusion is the hope that, despite all the odds and evidence to the contrary, things might just go your way. If all signs are pointing toward a life of overwhelming and impending crisis -- a vicious cycle in which you forever inherit and bequeath an algae-covered pool -- why not take a chance on willing some of your dreams into reality?
By the time my dad and I vacationed at the Lani Kai, the hardest conversations between us had taken place. He preferred the homeless lifestyle, and there was nothing I could do about it. "Don't worry 'bout me, Pumpkin. I was in the service. In a pup tent in the wilderness. This is no different," he must've told me a thousand times.
For three days and two nights on Fort Myers Beach, we did what we always did when on vacation: We ate key lime pie. We woke up early and looked for seashells, giving each other the most beautiful ones we found, like peace offerings. We even went parasailing, which I'm kind of afraid to mention, given that many people are adamantly against poor people enjoying themselves. It's a deeply held American sentiment that those experiencing financial hardship shouldn't have things like iPhones or home births, or eat organic food. Imagine how they'd feel about a homeless guy gliding through the clouds.
My father died during the pandemic. I wasn't home when his ashes were delivered. My 3-year-old son and I returned to a pink U.S.P.S. notice on our door that read "Remains." The next day we picked up the box, sat in the living room and opened it. I had never seen anyone's ashes. I was surprised that they weren't really ashes but powdery sand and fragments of bone.
I held his remains in my hand. I guess I've always kind of known that we're made of stardust, but this seemed like proof. It was also proof that the imprint of a parent's existence on a child's existence is everlasting.
In January, I was approved for a Mastercard with a $ 6,000 credit limit and a 29.99 percent A.P.R. -- a miracle, considering my low credit score and maxed-out Visa and Amex. The Mastercard allowed my son and I to fly to Florida and search for the perfect send-off spot for Dad's ashes.
We settled on a sunny patch of South Beach with gliding sea gulls and cruise ships glowing gold in the distance. This was not the burial my father wanted. He had asked to be laid to rest in a coffin, complete with a 21-gun salute. But I just didn't have the money. And it's not like Dad had burial insurance. He died with one possession: a can of Armour Treet Luncheon Loaf.
For a man who spent 40 years in the car business, working 12-hour days (often with one day off per month) to arrive at the end of his life owning so little may seem tragic. But in a way, I found it inspiring. With his ties to this world so deeply severed, he was truly free to move on to the next.
Water up to my waist, I held on to my son and the two of us sprinkled Dad's ashes into the ocean. We said our final goodbye, then headed back to the hotel.
Just in time for happy hour.

New President of World Bank Faces Pressure to Shift Focus To Fighting Climate Change: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The incoming president will be under pressure to juggle the global institution's ambitions to combat climate change and fight poverty.
Ajay Banga officially became the 14th president of the World Bank on Friday and urged staff to join him in developing a "new playbook" for a global institution whose relevance has come into question in recent years.
The ascension of Mr. Banga to be the next leader of the bank comes at a pivotal moment in its 77-year history. The global pandemic reversed decades of progress in poverty reduction, Russia's war in Ukraine continues to be a threat to economic stability and the World Bank is under new pressure to become a more ambitious player in the fight against climate change.
"Making good on our ambition will require us to evolve to maximize resources and write a new playbook, to think creatively, take informed risks and forge new partnerships with civil society and multilateral institutions," Mr. Banga wrote in a note to staff that was viewed by The New York Times.
Mr. Banga was nominated by President Biden in February after the resignation of David Malpass, the outgoing World Bank president who had been selected by former President Donald J. Trump. The World Bank's executive board approved Mr. Banga in May following an extensive listening tour that included visits to eight countries and dozens of meetings with government officials around the world.
In his message to staff, Mr. Banga defined the bank's mission as aspiring to "create a world free from poverty on a livable planet."
It is the second part of that mission by which Mr. Banga will be likely be judged.
Mr. Malpass left the job a year early after failing to sufficiently demonstrate his commitment to combating global warming amid a renewed emphasis from the Biden administration broadening the bank's focus on the environment.
However, Mr. Banga, a former chief executive of Mastercard, does not bring extensive climate credentials to the job and will be under pressure to demonstrate progress on the bank's environmental agenda. He has described the tasks of dealing with climate change and poverty as intertwined.
"The World Bank's challenge is clear: It must pursue both climate adaptation and mitigation; it must reach out to lower-income countries without turning its back on middle-income countries; it must think globally but recognize national and regional needs; it must embrace risk but do so prudently," Mr. Banga wrote in a statement to World Bank's executive board that accompanied his memo to staff.
Climate activists plan to appear outside the World Bank on Friday and attempt to hand postcards to staff with demands that they want Mr. Banga to heed during his first 100 days on the job. They continue to be frustrated that the World Bank finances coal, oil and gas projects despite its pledges to prioritize clean energy projects.
Mr. Banga is expected to use his expertise to amplify the resources of the World Bank and build new partnerships between the private and public sectors. The former finance executive added in his memo that accomplishing the World Bank's many goals will require an annual global investment of trillions of dollars.
Mr. Banga will also face a difficult diplomatic task as he seeks to satisfy the climate ambitions of the United States and Europe while facing skepticism from some developing countries. He will also confront the delicate task of urging China, a major World Bank shareholder and creditor, to allow poor countries that have borrowed huge sums from Beijing to restructure their debts.
The World Bank president is traditionally chosen by the United States; the managing director of the International Monetary Fund is selected by the European Union.
Mr. Banga met on Thursday with Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen. They discussed ways to refine how the bank operates and make it more agile and responsive, according to a summary of their conversation released by the Treasury Department.

Walmart Raises Its Outlook as Shoppers Look for Bargains Amid Inflation: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The retailer reported revenue that beat expectations and said it expected net sales to rise 3.5 percent for the year.
Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States, raised its annual guidance on Thursday, a sign that it expects shoppers to continue to gravitate toward its value-oriented stores as they become more selective about their purchases.
The retailer said it expected net sales to increase 3.5 percent for the fiscal year and operating income to rise up to 4.5 percent.
Revenue in the first quarter was $ 152.3 billion, beating Wall Street's estimate of $ 141.7 billion. Both the transactions and average amount customers spent rose in the quarter.
Higher-income households and younger customers are shopping more at Walmart, the company said, reflecting a trend that its executives have called out in recent quarters as Americans face higher-than-usual inflation. The retailer said it had also gained market share in the grocery category.
"We had a strong quarter," said Doug McMillon, Walmart's chief executive, in a statement on Thursday.
On a call with analysts, Mr. McMillon said inflation was slowing down consumer spending in discretionary categories like apparel and home goods. That, in turn, is causing uncertainty for Walmart executives as they plan for the year ahead.
"We all need those prices to come down," Mr. McMillon said. "The persistently high rates of inflation in these categories, lasting for such a long period of time, are weighing on some of the families we serve."
Retail earnings reports this week provided a glimpse into the mind-set of the American consumer and the state of the industry. Target, Home Depot and TJX, which owns T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, all reported first-quarter earnings that showed sales had moderated compared with the past few years, when shoppers were spending more freely.
Home Depot on Tuesday lowered its full-year guidance and said sales in the first quarter declined 4.2 percent from a year earlier. Executives said they had expected 2023 would be a "year of moderation" for the home improvement sector, but the company's performance was below expectations.
Target's quarterly sales increased a modest 0.5 percent. The retailer maintained its full-year guidance, but said that "based on softening sales trends" in the most recent quarter, it was planning for a wide range of sales outcomes in the second quarter.
Overall sales at T.J. Maxx's parent company increased 3 percent. Its T.J. Maxx and Marshalls brands, which offer name-brand items to shoppers at discounted prices, posted an increase, but sales at HomeGoods declined 7 percent. It maintained its full-year guidance and forecast an increase in sales of 2 to 3 percent.
Analysts said the sales declines were a sign of consumers being more selective about what they bought, along with spending patterns gaining some semblance of normalcy after being less predictable during the pandemic. Broadly, the economy has remained resilient, with wage growth strong and jobs being added across a wide range of industry.
"We're not seeing a collapse of revenue," Simeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, said. "We're seeing revenue disappointments. Consumers are still spending on the things that they decide they want to spend on."
Retailers are facing a profit challenge. Walmart said on Thursday that its gross profit rate, or the difference between the cost of the goods and their sales, had fallen to 23.7 percent, slightly missing Wall Street's estimates. The rate declined in part because shoppers were buying more groceries and products in Walmart's health and wellness category and less general merchandise. Groceries typically have lower profit margins than discretionary categories like apparel.
Target said on Wednesday that its gross margin rate increased to 26.3 percent from a year earlier, when it had a glut of inventory and supply chain costs were higher. It said higher prices had also helped lift that number. But Target warned that shrink, the industry's term for inventory that entered a store or warehouse but left without being accounted for, would hurt its profitability by more than $ 500 million compared with last year.
Retail analysts have expected thinner company margins this quarter, given more promotions to entice shoppers and more purchases of items, like groceries, that bring in lower profits.
That consumer behavior was reflected in this week's retail sales report for April. Retail sales increased at a modest 0.4 percent from March, reversing a two-month decline. (The number is not adjusted for inflation and sometimes is revised.)
Department stores, health and personal care stores, and grocery stores all recorded increases. Spending at furniture stores, electronic stores and home improvement retailers declined. Spending at restaurants and bars increased 14.5 percent.
Restaurants and flights are usually considered discretionary, but they are also experiences, which Americans are spending more on. There is less emphasis on buying big-ticket items for the home given that many shoppers spent the early stages of the pandemic doing just that.
"Part of what we're experiencing now is a bit of a rebalancing in the consumer budget," said Michelle Meyer, chief economist at Mastercard. "As we look forward, should we expect this split between experiences and goods to last forever? Of course not. But there's still more catch-up that needs to happen for some of these experience-based spending categories where consumers are still very eager to satisfy their lingering demand."
Some analysts, though, warn that a confluence of factors -- including less money in savings, tightening credit and continued high prices -- will make shoppers pull back in the second half of the year.
Michael Lasser, a retail analyst at UBS, said the "very clear pattern" with retailers' earnings results this week showed that consumers were being more discerning about what they purchased.
"My personal belief is that that's going to continue for the foreseeable future," Mr. Lasser said. "What will greatly influence the direction of spend from there is what happens to the labor market."

Biden's Pick Is Confirmed As New Leader Of World Bank: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Banga's appointment to a five-year term was confirmed on Wednesday by the World Bank.
Ajay Banga, President Biden's pick to be president of the World Bank and broaden its ambitions to combat climate change, was approved by its executive board on Wednesday.
Mr. Banga will assume the job on June 2 and succeed David Malpass, who was nominated by former President Donald J. Trump and has served in the job for four years. A former chief executive of Mastercard who was raised in India, the incoming president will bring deep experience with developing economies and financial expertise to a global institution facing a critical moment of transition.
The approval by the bank's board of 25 executive directors was not unanimous. Russia, which has been largely isolated in international forums since its invasion of Ukraine, abstained. Russia signaled in March that it was trying to find an alternate candidate, but ultimately Mr. Banga was the only nominee put forward.
The World Bank president is traditionally an American citizen who is chosen by the United States, while the managing director of the International Monetary Fund is chosen by the European Union.
Mr. Biden praised the board's decision in a statement on Wednesday, expressing optimism that Mr. Banga would help steer the bank to address challenges such as climate change in ways that will make it even more effective in its mission to reduce poverty.
"Ajay Banga will be a transformative leader," Mr. Biden said, "bringing expertise, experience and innovation to the position of World Bank president."
Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, who was an early proponent of Mr. Banga's candidacy within the Biden administration, said she expected the incoming president would extend the bank's reach by building new partnerships between governments and the private sector. She added that she expected to see a "staged adoption of reforms" over the course of the next year.
"Ajay understands that the challenges we face -- from combating climate change, pandemics, and fragility to eliminating extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity -- are deeply intertwined," Ms. Yellen said. "He has effectively built a broad global coalition around his vision for the bank over the course of his candidacy."
Mr. Banga will face high expectations and urgent questions about whether the bank will change its lending model, whether it will seek more money from shareholders and how it should address issues including poverty, global warming and the war in Ukraine. He will also face a challenging diplomatic environment, trying to satisfy the climate ambitions of the United States while maintaining the bank's focus on development. And he will have to navigate a delicate relationship with China, a major shareholder and creditor that has been facing international pressure to allow poor countries to restructure their debts.
The leadership change comes at a fraught time for the global economy, which has been gripped by a pandemic, inflation and war in the past three years. Those colliding crises have sent millions of people into poverty and reversed decades of development progress.
The bank's backing of Mr. Banga, who was tapped by Mr. Biden in February, followed an extensive listening tour that included visits to eight countries and dozens of meetings with government officials around the world.
The withheld support from Russia made the voting process an unusual one and underscored the friction that its war in Ukraine has created within international institutions.
Biden administration officials declined to comment on how Russia voted and said they were confident that Mr. Banga would assume the job with a strong mandate and robust support.
Mr. Banga is being appointed to serve a five-year term. His predecessor, Mr. Malpass, announced earlier this year that he would step down following criticism that he was not sufficiently committed to revamping the World Bank's climate agenda.

World Bank's New Chief Will Be Pressed to Pivot Toward Climate Action: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Under pressure from world leaders, development experts and shareholders, the bank opens its spring meeting on Monday, poised for big changes.
As World Bank shareholders gather in Washington for their annual spring meeting on Monday, the global institution appears to be on the brink of significant change.
World leaders, led by President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados, along with a constellation of academics and development experts want the bank to do more to help poor countries grappling with climate change. The bank has set out its own vision for transformation, in response to calls for action from the United States and others. Major shareholders have approved some initial reforms, including agreements to let the bank lend more money and attract more private investment.
At the center of the discussions will be Ajay Banga, who is widely expected to be confirmed as president of the bank in the coming weeks. When he takes over this summer, he will face high expectations and urgent questions about whether the bank will change its lending model, whether it will seek more money from shareholders and how he will direct the bank to address issues including poverty, global warming and the war in Ukraine.
"He'll get a honeymoon, but he better use that honeymoon well," said Mark Malloch-Brown, the president of the Open Societies Foundations and a former vice president of the World Bank. "These institutions do not change quickly."
A longtime finance executive, Mr. Banga, 63, became chief executive at Mastercard in 2010, shortly after the company, which had been owned by a coalition of more than 25,000 financial institutions, went public. During 10 years as C.E.O., he built Mastercard into a powerhouse now worth $ 350 billion.
"He fundamentally transformed what was a slow, bank-association culture into a high-performing, agile, innovative, proactive, now Fortune 20 company," said Mike Froman, a longtime Mastercard executive who is preparing to take over the Council on Foreign Relations. "That involved everything from leadership, motivation, vision, but also very importantly, changing culture."
Critics of the bank complain that, in addition to being insufficiently focused on climate change, it is woefully slow to respond to major crises and lacks ambition and creativity.
Mr. Banga said he intends to bring a new sense of urgency to the bank's core mission of alleviating global poverty, while also taking on some of the biggest crises in the world today.
"Inequality is intertwined completely with challenges like climate change, challenges like fragility of the world with refugees and the like being caused by conflict, with challenges like the pandemic, with challenges like with Russia and Ukraine, with what that does to food and fertilizer," he said in an interview. "I don't think you can segregate these into buckets and hope that you can deal with one without dealing with the other."
Mr. Banga also will be faced with a delicate diplomatic task when he assumes the job. Although he has been nominated by the Biden administration, he will have to navigate the tension between the United States and China and he will need to press all of the major shareholders to make sure that their investments in the bank match their stated ambitions.
At a congressional hearing last month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, whose portfolio includes overseeing the United States' investment in the World Bank, made clear that she hopes the bank can help weaken China's effort to exert influence in the developing world, which the United States views as predatory.
She wants the World Bank to provide an alternative lending option that provides "quality infrastructure investment" that is "responsible."
"I'm very, very concerned about some of the activities that China engages in globally, investing in countries in ways that leave them trapped in debt and don't promote economic development," Ms. Yellen said. "We are working very hard to counter that influence in all of the international institutions that we participate in."
Securing more funding for the World Bank that would allow it to increase its lending capacity could also be difficult. Ms. Yellen said that she thinks the World Bank can initially boost its capacity by stretching its existing resources and being more innovative.
However, the United States is not currently calling for increasing the capital available to the bank. "We do want to see federal mobilization of private resources alongside World Bank investments," Ms. Yellen said. "But we're not requesting a capital increase at this time."
Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, said the debate over more funding for the World Bank will likely circle back to the question of China and the question of why the world's second largest economy continues to borrow from the bank.
He said China's borrowing from the bank is likely to find more acceptance if it is for projects with global benefits, such as reducing emissions, rather than for traditional local projects. "I definitely think it's still an area of tension," Mr. Morris said.
But among the areas where Mr. Banga will be most closely scrutinized is how he uses the bank to confront climate change.
Mr. Banga was tapped to lead the World Bank in February after David Malpass, the current president of the bank, said he would retire a year ahead of schedule. Mr. Malpass, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, opted to step down early after he came under fire because he declined to say if he accepted the scientific consensus that fossil fuels were rapidly warming the planet.
For years, the bank has been denounced by critics who say it hasn't adequately responded to the economic devastation from climate change, which is disproportionately felt by poor countries. The bank has defended its record, saying it has ramped up its lending for climate projects in recent years.
Mr. Banga, who grew up in India, will be the first World Bank president from the developing world. And he says he is attuned to the urgency of the threats posed by a warming world. "I care about climate," Mr. Banga said. "Because we're running out of time."
Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and a major funder of climate action, said he believed Mr. Banga was up to the task.
"He has made clear that climate change will become more fully integrated into the bank's work and mission," Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement. "And his background positions him to capitalize on the eagerness of financial institutions to form new partnerships with the World Bank that increase access to clean energy."
Mr. Banga will be in Washington this week but not have a formal role in the meetings, given he has not yet been confirmed. Substantial reforms are unlikely to be codified at the bank's spring meetings.
"Civil society will say this has got to go a lot further, and that it's still missing a level of ambition," Mr. Malloch Brown said. "People will be expecting a much bigger installment by the time of the annual meetings in the fall."
Instead, world leaders and development experts will be looking for clues about shifting priorities, whether the bank is likely to request more money from its shareholders and how Mr. Banga is prepared to approach his role.
"This is a very important job, but it's not his job alone," said Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and a former vice president at the World Bank. "Other governments have to do what they need to do, other institutions have to do their part too. The worst thing in the world would be to hang around Banga's neck expectations that he alone can solve these problem. The system is bigger than one person."

As World Bank shareholders gather in Washington for their annual spring meeting Monday, the global institution appears to be on the brink of significant change.
World leaders, led by French President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados, along with a constellation of academics and development experts want the bank to do more to help poor countries grappling with climate change. The bank has set out its own vision for transformation, in response to calls for action from the United States and others. Major shareholders have approved some initial reforms, including agreements to let the bank lend more money and attract more private investment.
At the center of the discussions will be Ajay Banga, who is widely expected to be confirmed as president of the bank in the coming weeks. When he takes over this summer, he will face high expectations and urgent questions about whether the bank will change its lending model, whether it will seek more money from shareholders and how he will direct the bank to address issues including poverty, global warming and the war in Ukraine.
“He’ll get a honeymoon, but he better use that honeymoon well,” said Mark Malloch-Brown, the president of the Open Societies Foundation and a former vice president of the World Bank. “These institutions do not change quickly.”
A longtime finance executive, Banga, 63, became CEO at Mastercard in 2010, shortly after the company, which had been owned by a coalition of more than 25,000 financial institutions, went public. During 10 years as CEO, he built Mastercard into a powerhouse now worth $350 billion.
“He fundamentally transformed what was a slow, bank-association culture into a high-performing, agile, innovative, proactive, now Fortune 20 company,” said Mike Froman, a longtime Mastercard executive who is preparing to take over the Council on Foreign Relations. “That involved everything from leadership, motivation, vision, but also very importantly, changing culture.”
Critics of the bank complain that, in addition to being insufficiently focused on climate change, it is woefully slow to respond to major crises and lacks ambition and creativity.
Banga said he intends to bring a new sense of urgency to the bank’s core mission of alleviating global poverty, while also taking on some of the biggest crises in the world today.
“Inequality is intertwined completely with challenges like climate change, challenges like fragility of the world with refugees and the like being caused by conflict, with challenges like the pandemic, with challenges like with Russia and Ukraine, with what that does to food and fertilizer,” he said in an interview. “I don’t think you can segregate these into buckets and hope that you can deal with one without dealing with the other.”
Banga also will be faced with a delicate diplomatic task when he assumes the job. Although he has been nominated by the Biden administration, he will have to navigate the tension between the United States and China and he will need to press all of the major shareholders to make sure that their investments in the bank match their stated ambitions.
At a congressional hearing last month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, whose portfolio includes overseeing the United States’ investment in the World Bank, made clear that she hopes the bank can help weaken China’s effort to exert influence in the developing world, which the United States views as predatory.
She wants the World Bank to provide an alternative lending option that provides “quality infrastructure investment” that is “responsible.”
“I’m very, very concerned about some of the activities that China engages in globally, investing in countries in ways that leave them trapped in debt and don’t promote economic development,” Yellen said. “We are working very hard to counter that influence in all of the international institutions that we participate in.”
Securing more funding for the World Bank that would allow it to increase its lending capacity could also be difficult. Yellen said that she thinks the World Bank can initially boost its capacity by stretching its existing resources and being more innovative.
However, the United States is not currently calling for increasing the capital available to the bank. “We do want to see federal mobilization of private resources alongside World Bank investments,” Yellen said. “But we’re not we’re not requesting a capital increase at this time.”
Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, said the debate over more funding for the World Bank will likely circle back to the question of China and the question of why the world’s second largest economy continues to borrow from the bank.
He said China’s borrowing from the bank is likely to find more acceptance if it is for projects with global benefits, such as reducing emissions, rather than for traditional local projects. “I definitely think it’s still an area of tension,” Morris said.
But among the areas where Banga will be most closely scrutinized is how he uses the bank to confront climate change.
Banga was tapped to lead the World Bank in February after David Malpass, the current president of the bank, said he would retire a year ahead of schedule. Malpass, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, opted to step down early after he came under fire because he declined to say if he accepted the scientific consensus that fossil fuels were rapidly warming the planet.
For years, the bank has been denounced by critics who say it hasn’t adequately responded to the economic devastation from climate change, which is disproportionately felt by poor countries. The bank has defended its record, saying it has ramped up its lending for climate projects in recent years.
Banga, who grew up in India, will be the first World Bank president from the developing world. And he says he is attuned to the urgency of the threats posed by a warming world. “I care about climate,” Banga said. “Because we’re running out of time . ”
Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and a major funder of climate action, said he believed Banga was up to the task.
“He has made clear that climate change will become more fully integrated into the bank’s work and mission,” Bloomberg said in a statement. “And his background positions him to capitalize on the eagerness of financial institutions to form new partnerships with the World Bank that increase access to clean energy.”
Banga will be in Washington this week but not have a formal role in the meetings, given he has not yet been confirmed. Substantial reforms are unlikely to be codified at the bank’s spring meetings..
“Civil society will say this has got to go a lot further, and that it’s still missing a level of ambition,” Malloch-Brown said. “People will be expecting a much bigger installment by the time of the annual meetings in the fall.”
Instead, world leaders and development experts will be looking for clues about shifting priorities, whether the bank is likely to request more money from its shareholders and how Banga is prepared to approach his role.
“This is a very important job, but it’s not his job alone,” said Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and a former vice president at the World Bank. “Other governments have to do what they need to do, other institutions have to do their part too. The worst thing in the world would be to hang around Banga’s neck expectations that he alone can solve these problem. The system is bigger than one person.”

Biden Pick Seems a Lock To Lead the World Bank
The Biden administration's choice to run the World Bank -- the former Mastercard chief executive Ajay Banga -- appears to have a lock on the job. The World Bank said Thursday that Banga was the only candidate nominated in a search that began more than a month ago. The current president of the 189-nation poverty-fighting organization, David Malpass, announced last month that he would step down in June, nearly a year before his five-year term was due to expire in April 2024. The World Bank is under pressure to do more to help poor countries finance projects to combat and prepare for climate change without saddling them with debt. Mr. Banga, currently vice chairman at private equity firm General Atlantic, has more than 30 years of business experience, having served in various roles at Mastercard and the boards of the American Red Cross, Kraft Foods and Dow Inc.

CARMAKERS
Ford Raises Base Price Of F-150 Electric Truck
Ford has raised the base price of its popular F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck again, the automaker's website showed on Thursday, the latest in a series of price increases aimed at offsetting high costs. The base variant of the Lightning now starts at $ 59,974, excluding shipping and taxes, up nearly 50 percent from its starting price when introduced last year. Ford resumed production of the trucks this month after recalling 18 of them because of a batterycell manufacturing defect. A week earlier, Ford said that it expected its electric-vehicle business unit to lose $ 3 billion this year, but that the unit remained on track to achieve a pretax margin of 8 percent by late 2026. Shares of Ford were up 2 percent at the close of trading on Thursday. The company was not immediately available for further comment on the price increase, which was reported earlier by Automotive News. REUTERS

Wells Fargo Will Pay $ 97.8 Million in Fines
Wells Fargo will pay fines of about $ 97.8 million for inadequate oversight of its compliance risks, enabling the apparent violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran, Syria and Sudan, federal authorities said on Thursday. The bank's deficient oversight enabled it to violate U.S. sanctions by providing a trade finance platform to a foreign bank that used it to process $ 532 million in prohibited transactions, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control said. The Fed fined Wells Fargo $ 67.8 million, while the Office of Foreign Assets Control fined the bank $ 30 million for inadequate oversight of its compliance risks from 2010 to 2015. In a release, Office of Foreign Assets Control said Wells Fargo and its predecessor, Wachovia Bank, had provided a European bank with software beginning in 2008 that allowed the firm to process 124 transactions involving sanctioned individuals or jurisdictions.

Adidas Ends Opposition To B.L.M. Trademark
Two days after Adidas objected to a trademark application by the advocacy group Black Lives Matter for a logo featuring three parallel stripes, right, the German sportswear company said that it would withdraw its opposition. Adidas challenged the trademark application in a filing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Monday. On Wednesday, the company said in an emailed statement that it would withdraw its opposition "as soon as possible." In the filing on Monday, Adidas said that it opposed the Black Lives Matter application because it showed a trademark that "incorporates three stripes in a manner that is confusingly similar" to the company's familiar three-stripe logo "in appearance and overall commercial impression." The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation filed the trademark application for a yellow three-stripe logo design in November 2020. The group is one of several organizations associated with the wider Black Lives Matter movement, which emerged in 2013 after George Zimmerman was acquitted of killing Trayvon Martin, a Black teenager. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In its statement, Adidas did not say why it was reversing its opposition to the trademark application. In September 2022, the window opened for individuals and groups to file their opposition to the foundation's trademark application. Adidas repeatedly sought to extend the window before submitting its notice of opposition on Monday, according to the filing. Adidas said that it had been using a three-stripe mark on footwear since at least 1952 and that the design had been used in its partnerships with professional athletes. In the filing, the company said that the public understood that the three-stripe mark "distinguishes and identifies Adidas's merchandise." AMANDA HOLPUCH

Group Criticizes Uganda Over Anti-L.G.B.T.Q. Bill
A business group including corporate giants like Google says it opposes Uganda's anti-L.G.B.T.Q. legislation, calling it "a concern for global businesses and investors operating or planning to invest" in the East African country. The legislation, which prescribes the death penalty or life imprisonment for some homosexual offenses, would hurt Uganda's economy, the Open For Business coalition said in a statement Wednesday. "Diversity and inclusion are core principles of our coalition partners in the conduct of their businesses," the statement said. The legislation, if signed into law by President Yoweri Museveni, "would undermine Uganda's attractiveness as a place to do business and invest," it said. In addition to Google, the Open For Business coalition includes companies such as Microsoft, MasterCard, HSBC and Facebook's owner, Meta. Uganda's legislature last week passed the anti-homosexuality bill. The legislation is now with Mr. Museveni, who can sign it into law or return it back to the parliamentary speaker with proposed changes. The bill has wide support in Uganda, including among church leaders. It was introduced last month by an opposition lawmaker who said his goal was to punish the "promotion, recruitment and funding" of L.G.B.T.Q. activities in the country. Only two of 389 legislators present to vote opposed the bill. ASSOCIATED PRESS

How the World Bank Can Help Countries Hurt by Climate Change: [Editorial]

Full text: It's one of the great injustices of this era that countries contributing negligible amounts to global carbon emissions are now feeling the most harrowing impacts of climate change. Pakistan, which makes up less than 1 percent of the world's carbon footprint, had a third of its territory under water in last year's floods. Parts of Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia are experiencing the worst drought in 70 years of record-keeping, threatening millions with famine, even though the entire continent of Africa contributes less than 4 percent of global carbon emissions. Small island developing countries such as Papua New Guinea account for less than 1 percent of global carbon emissions, yet they stand to lose the most when sea levels rise.
The World Bank and the donor countries that control it can do more to step up and tackle this generational challenge. To make the World Bank and other multilateral lending institutions fit for purpose in the 21st century, leaders need to figure out how to raise and leverage the massive amounts of capital that are going to be necessary in the coming years to help countries adapt to and mitigate a changing climate.
For years, climate financing took a back seat to the bank's twin goals of reducing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. Today, it is integral to achieving those goals. Helping the poorest of the poor will increasingly mean ensuring access to drought-resistant seeds and access to water as lakes dry up. In middle-income countries, promoting shared prosperity will increasingly mean expanding access to reliable, affordable clean energy. The World Bank has played an active role in making progress in those areas. It has begun to help countries incorporate climate change into their overall economic development plans and should continue this necessary work.
Climate-related funding has already grown in importance at the bank; in fact, some of the poorest countries are already worried that it will cut into funding for basics like education and health care. That's why additional funding is needed to assure them that taking global action on climate won't come at the expense of their development. About 36 percent of the money the World Bank lent last year was classified as climate related, although questions have been raised about how classifications are made. That comes to nearly $ 32 billion -- a big jump from previous years, but still far short of what is needed.
In 2009, donor countries promised to mobilize $ 100 billion a year by 2020 to help lower income countries with mitigation and adaptation. They only mustered $ 83 billion, $ 36.9 billion of which came from multilateral development banks and climate funds, in 2020. Those unfulfilled promises haven't gone unnoticed. According to Ephraim Mwepya Shitima, chair of the African Group of Negotiators on climate change, many developing countries, including those in Africa, have put forth ambitious plans to curb emissions in the future, but have been "hampered by the pledged financial support, which are falling short of expectations."
Although Covid, inflation and the energy crisis related to the war in Ukraine have strained government budgets everywhere, it would be shortsighted to ignore the significance and potential of investing in climate financing. According to Devesh Kapur, a professor at Johns Hopkins and co-author of a history of the World Bank, raising an additional $ 100 billion in lending capacity for the World Bank could require donors to put up about $ 20 billion in cash. The cost to the United States, which holds 16 percent of shares, would be $ 3.2 billion, an amount that could be paid out over five years.
Getting new money in the door is important, but it's not enough. The bank also should adopt new strategies and new rules that will allow it to funnel money more quickly to where it is needed the most and will be used most effectively. For instance, some small island states have per capita incomes that are too high for concessional loans according to World Bank rules, despite their acute vulnerability to climate change. Those rules should be revisited, in some cases, to make sure that climate financing is prioritizing the areas that will make the biggest difference.
The bank should also provide more grants and below-market financing related to climate, as Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts has called for. The World Bank and multilateral development banks provided only 15 percent of their adaptation finance and less than 5 percent of mitigation finance through grants -- a fraction he called "shockingly low." By comparison, Green Climate Fund, a multilateral climate fund, issued grants 41 percent of the time for adaptation and mitigation projects.
The transformation that is required at the World Bank will not be easy. But the departure of its former president, David Malpass, who says he will resign in June, might help build confidence in the bank's climate work. Mr. Malpass, who was nominated by the Trump administration in 2019, has been the subject of controversy since his bewildering public refusal last year to acknowledge the role of human activity in extreme weather resulting from climate change.
Ajay Banga, the former chief executive of Mastercard, is President Biden's nominee to lead the bank, and is likely to be confirmed next month. The leadership change presents an opportunity to clarify the bank's role and lay out an ambitious vision for its future. Mr. Banga, who has recently visited several African countries, has said that he sees the bank's goals of addressing poverty, shared growth and climate as "intertwined."
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who has been at the forefront of calls to overhaul the bank and to elevate the issue of climate, also noted the need for more concessional financing in a recent speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The bank was designed to lend to individual countries to spur economic growth within their own borders, but that model doesn't work to address global problems like climate change, she said, because the benefits "stretch far beyond the borders of the country where a given project takes place."
If the benefits of investing in climate change adaptation and mitigation are shared, so should the costs.

Full text: This documentary looks at the offenses of the pornography industry through interviews with performers and activists.
In December 2020, the journalist Nicholas Kristof wrote a column in the Opinion section of The New York Times detailing the stories of young survivors whose sexual abuse was posted on the website Pornhub. The piece, which urged the site to make changes, led to Pornhub's banning of uploads from unverified users, and to Visa and Mastercard's prohibiting the use of their cards on the website. Kristof's article plays a complicated role in "Money Shot: The Pornhub Story," a documentary on Netflix that shrewdly puts center stage some of the professional porn performers seeking autonomy in the industry.
Through interviews with workers and their advocates (and with Kristof), the documentary filmmaker Suzanne Hillinger (who also produced and directed episodes of The Times's "The Weekly," a television show on FX, in 2019) persuasively argues that campaigns including Traffickinghub are aimed at curtailing abuse and helping victims but end up hurting another marginalized group: the sex workers and porn actors who thrive on these platforms, which enable them to work independently. Hillinger also spotlights the fact that some of the loudest anti-Pornhub voices have ties to the extreme political right‌.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Recent years have seen a slew of streaming documentaries about tech-world horrors, from dating hoaxes to crypto schemes. "Money Shot" includes some clichés from this subgenre -- if I see one more tweet pop up onscreen with the chirp sound effect, I will fly away myself -- but it mostly pushes against tropes. Hillinger steers clear of re-enactments, and instead favors relaxed scenes with porn professionals. Here is a documentary that casts a clear eye on the offenses of an industry driven by capitalism while never losing sight of the workers whose safety and success should be that profession's number one priority.

Full text: Priscilla Sims Brown's atypical childhood has helped her lead a financial institution from a different perspective as Amalgamated Bank's chief executive.
This article is part of our Women and Leadership special report that profiles women leading the way on climate, politics, business and more.
Priscilla Sims Brown, chief executive of Amalgamated Bank, said it was her uncommon upbringing that put her on the path to running the country's largest union-owned bank.
Born in 1957 to Ethiopian parents who were studying in New Mexico, she stayed behind when her mother and father returned to Africa. (Her mother, Marta Gabre-Tsadick, served as Ethiopia's first woman senator.)

But after a government coup in Ethiopia in the 1970s, her parents fled the country and returned to the United States. Ms. Brown joined them, and they moved from place to place while establishing a Christian nonprofit to help Ethiopian refugees.
Ms. Brown said her background gave her the confidence to pursue a path that could be difficult for women, and particularly women of color.
"Having spent my formative years in Germany, there were a lot of people from a lot of places," she said. "People can be made to feel inferior by difference. I was made to feel difference was pretty cool."
It wasn't until she was 14 and had returned to the United States that she experienced racism, Ms. Brown said. "I learned that racism existed, but I didn't own the inferiority, I didn't own the prejudice. I learned to lean into differences and be somewhat unconventional."
Her self-assurance has helped her climb the financial career ladder and to speak out on politically sensitive issues, like abortion and gun control.
Ms. Brown studied journalism at San Francisco State University, then landed a job at KQED, the local public radio and television station in the Bay Area. "I was first hired on the nightly news and I remember getting promoted to $ 4 an hour," she said.
What attracted her to journalism, she said, was the storytelling possibilities. She covered small business but quickly realized that she would rather engage in business than report on it.
Starting as a broker at the investment bank Paine Webber, she moved on to other companies, rising in the investment world hierarchy with each change. Her last position before moving to Amalgamated in 2021 was as group executive at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
Ms. Brown, 65, said Amalgamated was a good fit for her. "I so identify with the history," she said. "It was founded by mostly Eastern European textile workers who could not be banked. So they opened a bank -- and that's a pretty bold thing to do."
The bank's founders not only wanted to make sure that they provided opportunities for people like them, but also "to make sure that when it invested outside of their needs, it did so in a responsible way," she said. "And that continued throughout history."
The home page of her company's website lists 10 "Issues We Care About," including workers' and immigrants' rights, racial justice, anti-violence and gun safety. And though many companies are adopting environmental, social and governance benchmarks, known as E.S.G., Ms. Brown has gone further.
Amalgamated successfully petitioned the International Organization for Standardization to create a new merchant category code for gun stores. While codes exist for many different categories of merchants, there was no code attached to places that sold firearms.
Ms. Brown said Visa, Mastercard and American Express had already agreed to adopt the code, which she said could make it easier to flag suspicious activity, such as building up arsenals by buying guns from different stores.
Ms. Brown said her company's role was not to advocate for gun control or challenge the Second Amendment but "to do more to implement the code -- and it's a messy process," she said. "We need to try to mitigate the use of our systems for illegal behavior."
The bank's initiative drew attention to the institution and Ms. Brown in particular. Not all of it has been positive: She said she has received death threats.
Ms. Brown was also outspoken about last year's U.S. Supreme Court decision, Dobbs v. Jackson Health Organization, which overturned abortion rights. Amalgamated was one of the first companies to announce it would cover costs for any employee who needed to travel out of state to receive an abortion. "This is a workplace equity issue," she said.
In 2021, she said, one-third of the bank's lending portfolio went toward climate- or sustainability-related projects. The bank also prioritizes affordable housing for its real estate investments and works with funds that are geared toward closing the Black wealth gap.
Ms. Brown said she recognized that other institutions did not have the size or mission of Amalgamated, which was a relatively small bank with $ 7.7 billion in assets (the largest four banks in the United States had assets in the trillions). Amalgamated -- which has branches in California, New York, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C. -- went public in 2018. "I have a luxury most people don't have," Ms. Brown said.

Priscilla Sims Brown, CEO of Amalgamated Bank, said it was her uncommon upbringing that put her on the path to running the country’s largest union-owned bank.
Born in 1957 to Ethiopian parents who were studying in New Mexico, she stayed behind when her mother and father returned to Africa. (Her mother, Marta Gabre-Tsadick, served as Ethiopia’s first woman senator.) She spent the next 10 years living with an American military family in a small town between two American bases in Germany.
But after a government coup in Ethiopia in the 1970s, her parents fled the country and returned to the United States. Brown joined them, and they moved from place to place while establishing a Christian nonprofit to help Ethiopian refugees.

It wasn’t until she was 14 and had returned to the United States that she experienced racism, Brown said. “I learned that racism existed, but I didn’t own the inferiority, I didn’t own the prejudice. I learned to lean into differences and be somewhat unconventional.”

Priscilla Sims Brown, CEO of Amalgamated Bank, said it was her uncommon upbringing that put her on the path to running the country’s largest union-owned bank.
Born in 1957 to Ethiopian parents who were studying in New Mexico, she stayed behind when her mother and father returned to Africa.

She spent the next 10 years living with an American military family in a small town between two American bases in Germany.
But after a government coup in Ethiopia in the 1970s, her parents fled the country and returned to the United States. Brown joined them, and they moved from place to place while establishing a Christian nonprofit to help Ethiopian refugees.

What attracted her to journalism, she said, was the storytelling possibilities. She covered small business but quickly realized that she would rather engage in business than report on it.

Credit Card Points Are Being Paid For by the Poor: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: There's an undeniable feeling of excitement when you turn your daily credit card swipes at Starbucks into first-class airfare or a weekend jaunt to Costa Rica. Thanks to mobile banking and the ease of autopay, you can scrupulously avoid any additional costs by paying your monthly bill in full. Free flights and exclusive discounts abound.
Something for nothing, right?
Not exactly nothing. Credit card perks for educated, usually urban professionals are being subsidized by people who have less. In other words, when you book a hotel room or enjoy entry to an airport lounge at no cost, poor consumers are ultimately footing the bill.
Demand for rewards is only going up. In 2016, Chase launched its Sapphire Reserve card. The card comes with perks, bonuses and points multipliers that for big-spending travelers and diners are worth far more than its steep $ 550 annual fee. There was so much initial demand that Chase ran out of the metal slabs it prints the cards on. Sapphire's enormous success set off a credit card perks war, with numerous banks flooding the market with sign-on bonuses worth thousands of dollars.
In 2022, the Federal Reserve published data showing that the cost of rewards, as a share of total transaction volume on credit cards, increased 25 percent from 2015 through 2021. This bonanza has helped affluent professionals flood Instagram with envy-inducing shots of white sand beaches, hotel suites and plush airport lounges.
But these high-income travelers are also less likely to carry balances that incur interest charges and late fees, which traditionally increase profits for card issuers. So, to offset the cost of paying lavish rewards to these consumers, banks have sought to maximize other usage-based revenues.
Enter interchange fees, or the money it costs merchants to accept noncash payments. A recent study at Stanford found that when credit card rewards increase, so do these fees.
The United States now has some of the highest credit card processing costs in the world, typically at 2 percent to 2.25 percent of every purchase. This is eight to nine times as much as the prevailing swipe fee in the European Union. The vast majority of merchants pass these costs on to consumers by charging more for their products -- regardless of how one pays.
The result? Lower-income consumers are forced to pay higher prices on the goods they buy, but they rarely receive any benefit from rewards programs, according to the Federal Reserve, which has been tracking the distributional effects of card rewards. Its December 2022 report estimates an annual redistribution of $ 15 billion in rewards value from poorer people to richer people, from low-education people to highly educated people and from diverse communities to less diverse communities.
Put another way, credit card rewards are essentially a tax on less affluent consumers, who are much more likely to pay for their goods with cash, debit cards or standard credit products that accrue no such rewards.
According to the San Francisco Fed, Americans with annual incomes at the national median (a bit less than $ 70,000) use credit cards for 23 percent of purchases. The numbers drop off precipitously as income decreases. Roughly half of all households use cash or debit cards for most purchases. Households with annual incomes over $ 150,000 use a credit card the most frequently, or 44 percent of the time.
The poor are much less likely to have access to rewards credit cards, even if they want them. Why? Cards with the highest value rewards are often available only to the rich. First, you'll need a credit score of at least 700 to qualify for a premium card. That eliminates half the country. And only 21 percent of Black households have FICO scores above 700. Second, issuers consider your income and debt-to-income ratio, which can be used to disqualify card applicants with high credit scores. Banks just don't want to issue rewards-heavy cards and pay lucrative sign-on bonuses to consumers who have low credit limits and spend much less overall.
Now consider the design of these rewards programs: five times as many points on hotels, three times as many points on dining, a $ 300 credit to SoulCycle, a $ 100 credit to Saks Fifth Avenue. This generation of prestige points cards often rewards discretionary, even luxury purchases, further transferring dollars to the highest income card holders. Cash-back cards available to households with lower credit scores and incomes offer more modest rewards than their prestige alternatives do.
Visa and Mastercard operate the two largest card networks, accounting for 77 percent of about 650 million general purpose credit cards in the United States. They act as agents for thousands of banks and dictate the terms and fees that merchants must pay.
And business is booming. In 2021 these two companies generated $ 77 billion in credit card interchange fees, which they share with issuing banks.
The aggregate costs of credit card points, driven by Visa and Mastercard's longstanding interchange duopoly, spurred Senators Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Roger Marshall, Republican of Kansas, to introduce the Credit Card Competition Act last July. The House soon followed with its own bipartisan bill. Yet multiple attempts to attach the legislation to military and omnibus funding bills by year's end failed.
The act would have forced Visa and Mastercard to compete head-to-head with other processors, reducing their overwhelming market power to set rates. Lower interchange fees can mean lower prices for consumers. (Despite expected opposition from the now-Republican-controlled House, Mr. Durbin plans to reintroduce the bill this year, his office said.)
The American Bankers Association argues that such legislation would result in net harm. It points to reductions in credit card rewards programs and hints at the creation of new fees by banks to make up the lost revenues.
The first part is certainly true; however, it's hard to muster a defense for preserving rewards at Saks Fifth Avenue in the name of consumer welfare. The latter may also be true -- and sounds like something the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau should look into.
Opponents of the bill also correctly point out that network security could suffer in the short run: Introducing smaller players and novel technologies would create vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit. Visa and Mastercard do use their systemwide scale in the name of effective fraud protection. However, the economics of competition suggest that all companies, especially Visa and Mastercard, would be heavily incentivized to innovate on network security to preserve market share against new entrants.
A problem for any reform that helps working-class families will be that consumers who enjoy great privileges from premium credit cards would end up worse off. But they would be returning economic value to working Americans, whose production and consumption sustains the economy in the first place.
And prestige card holders surely will manage. They may have hoped to use points toward an overwater villa in the Maldives. If Congress acts, they can settle for a free hotel room in Hawaii.

Full text: Ajay Banga will begin a monthlong "global listening tour" to drum up support for his nomination to be the bank's next president.
The Biden administration's nominee to be the next president of the World Bank, the international development and climate institution, is embarking on a monthlong sprint around the globe to solidify support for his candidacy.
It will be the first opportunity for the nominee, Ajay Banga, to share his vision for the bank, which has been aiming to take on a more ambitious role in combating climate change while maintaining its core commitment to alleviating poverty.
Mr. Banga, who has had a long career in finance, faces the challenge of convincing nations that his decades of private-sector experience will help him transform the World Bank.
He will begin his "global listening tour" on Monday with stops in Ivory Coast and Kenya, the Treasury Department said on Friday. In Ivory Coast, he will meet with senior government officials, leaders of the African Development Bank and civil society organizations. In Kenya, he will visit the Kenya Climate Innovation Center and a World Bank-backed project that helps local entrepreneurs find ways to address climate change.
Mr. Banga will focus on how finding development solutions can be intertwined with climate goals and emphasize his experience working on financial inclusion in Africa, where he helped expand access to electronic payments systems while chief executive of Mastercard, a Treasury official said.
The whirlwind campaign will also take Mr. Banga to Asia, Latin America and Europe.
The White House nominated him last week after the unexpected announcement last month that David Malpass will step down as World Bank president by the end of June, nearly a year before the end of his five-year term. Mr. Malpass, who was nominated by President Donald J. Trump, ignited a controversy last year when he appeared to express skepticism about whether fossil fuels contribute to global warming.
During a briefing at the Treasury Department this week, Mr. Banga made clear that he had no doubts about the causes of climate change. "Yes, there is scientific evidence, and it matters," he said.
Careful to strike a balance between the bank's growing climate ambitions and its poverty-reduction goals, Mr. Banga emphasized that both issues were interconnected and equally important.
"My belief is that poverty alleviation, or shared prosperity, or all those words that essentially imply the idea of tackling inequality, cannot be divorced from the challenges of managing nature in a constructive way," Mr. Banga added.
The World Bank's nomination process runs through March 29, and other countries may offer candidates. But by tradition, the United States, the bank's largest shareholder, selects an American to be its president. The executive board hopes to choose a new president by early May.
If approved by the board, Mr. Banga will face an array of challenges. The world economy is slowly emerging from three years of pandemic and war that have slowed global growth and worsened poverty. Emerging economies face the prospect of a cascade of defaults in the coming years, and the World Bank has been vocal in calling for debt reduction.
The Biden administration has pointed to China, one of the world's largest creditors, as a primary obstacle in debt-restructuring efforts. Mr. Banga was careful not to be critical of China and said he expected to travel there in the coming weeks.
"Today I'm the nominee of the United States, but if I'm lucky enough to be elected, then I represent all the countries who are part of the bank," Mr. Banga said on Thursday. "Having their points of view known, understood and openly discussed -- maybe not agreed to, but openly discussed -- is an important part of leading a multilateral institution."
His nomination has won both praise and skepticism from climate activists and development experts.
Some climate groups have lamented Mr. Banga's lack of direct public-sector experience and expressed concern about his affiliation with companies that invest in the oil and gas industries.
"Many question whether his history at global multinationals such as Citibank, Nestlé, KFC and Mastercard will prepare him for the huge challenges of poverty and inequality," Recourse, a nonprofit environmental organization, said in a statement this week. Recourse has been critical of the World Bank's policies on gas transition, its exposure to coal and its pace of action on climate change.
Other prominent activists have praised Mr. Banga, including Vice President Al Gore, who predicted that he would bring "renewed leadership on the climate crisis to the World Bank."
And others viewed Mr. Banga as a natural choice to bridge the gap between the bank's broad mandates.
"Throughout discussions of the World Bank's evolution, borrowing countries have consistently communicated that financing for climate should not come at the expense of other development priorities," Stephanie Segal, a senior fellow with the Economics Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in an essay this week. "In nominating Banga, whose candidacy does not lead with climate, the United States has signaled agreement that the bank's development mandate cannot be abandoned in favor of a 'climate only' agenda."
The Biden administration has also faced questions about why it did not choose a woman to lead the bank, which has had only men serve as its full-time president.
Mr. Banga asserted that as someone who was born and educated in India, he would bring diversity and a unique perspective to the World Bank. He also emphasized that at Mastercard, he had demonstrated a commitment to empowering women and elevating them to senior roles.
"I think that you should credit the administration with taking a huge leap forward into finding somebody who wasn't born here, wasn't educated here," Mr. Banga said. "I believe that giving people a level playing field is our job."
He added: "And that means whether you're a woman, your color, your sexual orientation, growing up on the wrong side of the tracks, it doesn't matter."

The Week in Business: Fraud Charges for a Media Founder: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: What's Up? (Feb. 19-25)
A Precipitous Fall
Carlos Watson, the founder of Ozy Media, a digital media start-up that attracted funding from high-profile investors, was arrested by the F.B.I. on Thursday and charged with fraud and aggravated identity theft more than a year after the company announced it was shutting down. In court filings, prosecutors said Mr. Watson had been "engaged in a scheme to defraud Ozy's potential investors, potential acquirers, lenders and potential lenders" by misrepresenting its audience numbers and financial results. In September 2021, The New York Times wrote about an instance in which a top official at Ozy appeared to have posed as a YouTube executive on a call with Goldman Sachs bankers, assuring them that Ozy's videos performed well on the platform, when Ozy was trying to raise $ 40 million. Mr. Watson later identified Samir Rao, the company's former chief operating officer, as the impersonator. Mr. Rao and Suzee Han, Ozy's former chief of staff, previously pleaded guilty to related charges.
Change at the World Bank
The Biden administration tapped Ajay Banga, a former head of Mastercard, to be the next president of the World Bank, a pick aimed at reshaping the organization's priorities around climate change. The current president, David Malpass, who was picked by President Donald J. Trump, recently announced that he would step down by the end of June. He had come under fire for his views on the issue after he sidestepped an interview question about whether he accepted the scientific consensus linking fossil fuels and global warming. "I'm not a scientist," he said during the exchange, which took place in September at a New York Times event. While former Vice President Al Gore, known for his climate work, praised the nomination of Mr. Banga, Mr. Biden's choice drew criticism from some activists who had hoped for someone with a stronger climate background.
The Fed's Resolve
While investors on Wall Street have been more bullish recently about the outlook for interest rates, minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting showed that officials felt they had more work to do to slow down the economy and bring inflation under control. According to the notes, "all participants" believed it was necessary to continue raising rates, and many thought that easing the central bank's monetary policy now would risk halting the progress it had made in moderating inflation. While prices have begun to climb more slowly, data released since the Fed's Jan. 31-Feb. 1 meeting have included worrisome signs of inflation's staying power. According to a fresh reading on Friday from the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the measure on which it bases its 2 percent inflation target -- price increases unexpectedly picked up in January after slowing in recent months.
What's Next? (Feb. 26-March 4)
Student Loan Cancellation
Supreme Court justices will hear arguments on Tuesday on whether President Biden's executive action to cancel billions of dollars in student debt is constitutional. Mr. Biden announced the policy in August, saying he would wipe out up to $ 20,000 per borrower who met certain criteria. While celebrated by the millions of borrowers who would be eligible for the program and by progressive Democrats who had long been pushing for such a measure, Mr. Biden's plan faced swift backlash from political opponents and led to several lawsuits accusing the president of overstepping his authority and depriving states of future tax revenue. Justices put the case on an unusually fast track after the Justice Department filed an emergency application asking the Supreme Court to lift an injunction put in place by a lower court that blocked the policy from going into effect.
More Support for Ukraine
As President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine observed the first anniversary of Russia's war last week, the United States renewed its dedication to helping his country. On Friday, President Biden and his administration announced new economic sanctions on more than 200 individuals and entities, including a dozen Russian banks as well as people tied to the country's military and technology industries who have helped the country evade previous sanctions. The Biden administration has been concerned about Russia's trading partners like China and Turkey, which have supplied Russia with products that military forces as well as civilians could use. U.S. officials are also continuing discussions with Ukraine about funding its fighting: On the heels of Mr. Biden's trip to the war zone, when he pledged another $ 500 million in military aid, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen will visit Kyiv this week to meet with Ukrainian officials.
Gag Rules Are Curbed
Workers who lose their jobs -- and many have recently -- could be freer to speak about their workplaces and the terms of their departures as a result of a ruling by the National Labor Relations Board. Officials said last week that it was generally illegal for companies to ask workers to sign severance agreements that barred them from making disparaging statements about their employers or from disclosing details of the agreement. The decision, which the board said aligned with a longstanding precedent, could have a significant effect on workers and companies as industries like tech and media continue to conduct mass layoffs. But its scope remains limited to the protections guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Act, which ensures workers' rights to draw attention to unsafe working conditions or engage in other activities that benefit workers as a group.
What Else?
A pilot program testing out a four-day workweek was overwhelmingly popular with the 61 British companies that participated, according to a new report. Federal prosecutors added more details to the charges against Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced FTX founder, accusing him of relying on straw donors to influence politicians in Washington. And a Delaware judge heard arguments last week in a suit brought by shareholders over Elon Musk's executive compensation at Tesla.

Ex-Mastercard Chief, Born in India, Nominated to World Bank: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: President Biden tapped the former Mastercard chief executive to run an organization that found itself mired in controversy after comments by the current president about climate change.
BENGALURU, India -- The Biden administration nominated Ajay Banga, the former longtime chief executive of Mastercard, to be the next president of the World Bank, a selection that is likely to drastically reshape the global development institution and broaden its ambitions to combat climate change.
The nomination will initiate a monthslong confirmation process before a final decision by the World Bank's board. It is not clear if any other countries will nominate a candidate. The World Bank president is traditionally an American citizen chosen by the United States.
If confirmed, Mr. Banga will bring vast experience running large organizations and deep knowledge of the digital economy. Raised in India, he would bring a firsthand understanding of the challenges that developing countries face.
"Ajay is uniquely equipped to lead the World Bank at this critical moment in history," President Biden said in a statement. "He has spent more than three decades building and managing successful, global companies that create jobs and bring investment to developing economies, and guiding organizations through periods of fundamental change."
Speculation surrounding the nomination gathered momentum in the week since David Malpass, the current World Bank president, announced his intention to step down by the end of June, with nearly a year left in his five-year term. Mr. Malpass, who was picked by President Donald J. Trump, drew criticism from climate activists and stirred frustration among Biden administration officials for his lack of focus on the bank's climate agenda.
Those concerns came to a head in September, when Mr. Malpass came under fire for his views on climate change. When asked if he accepted the overwhelming scientific consensus that the burning of fossil fuels was causing global temperatures to rise, he demurred. "I'm not a scientist," he said. The exchange, during a live interview at a New York Times event, set off a slow-motion public relations crisis for Mr. Malpass.
Mr. Banga has sought to carve out a public stance signaling his concern for climate change, including at Mastercard. In 2020, under his watch, the company announced the creation of the Priceless Planet Coalition, a group of about 100 firms that make corporate investments to preserve the environment.
"No matter who you are or what you do, climate change affects you. But, it has the biggest negative impact on those who are socially and economically vulnerable," Mr. Banga said at the time.
Former Vice President Al Gore, who won a Nobel Prize for his work to fight global warming, praised the nomination. "Those who have worked with Ajay Banga know that he is an exemplary leader, and I am extremely optimistic that he will bring renewed leadership on the climate crisis to the World Bank," Mr. Gore said.
Still, his selection prompted dismay from some climate activists who have been calling on the Biden administration to nominate a president with a strong background in environmental issues. His lack of direct public-sector experience could also be viewed with skepticism by some development experts.
"Put simply, this is not the guy that President Biden should be nominating when a livable planet is teetering at the brink of collapse," John Noël, senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace USA, said in a statement. "If Mr. Banga is to lead the World Bank, we hope he will follow the demands of science and justice by lending significantly more money to climate projects and ending funding for oil and gas projects."
Others said the choice was indicative of the changing role of the World Bank. A central part of the next president's job will be re-engineering the institution to make it a more pivotal player in a coordinated effort by Western nations to address global warming, despite some developing countries' concerns that the mission could overtake the bank's poverty reduction goals.
"I think it's interesting that they're not tapping a climate expert per se, they are tapping someone who can help them with climate finance," said Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. "It sends a pretty clear signal that the U.S. wants to look at the bank as a bank."
Mr. Banga has described the challenge of climate change, which he called "humanity versus nature," as a matter of trade-offs that has for years stumped politicians.
"You end up applying what are shorter-term solutions to what are very long-term problems," Mr. Banga said in 2021 in a conversation at the Council on Foreign Relations. "And therefore you end up putting a band aid on an open wound."
Mr. Banga has become a close ally of Vice President Kamala Harris and is part of a group of 10 corporate executives who have worked with her office to raise $ 1 billion aimed at stemming the root causes of immigration from Central America. Ms. Harris has cited poverty, corruption, climate change and political instability as the factors fueling migration.
The collaboration has so far raised about $ 4 billion to support communities in the region. In an interview with The Times last fall, Mr. Banga said he approached the effort with the understanding that it would not result in any short-term wins.
"Investing in a region takes patience, time and resilience," Mr. Banga said.
Mr. Banga is currently a vice chairman of General Atlantic, a private equity firm. He retired from Mastercard in 2021 after running the company for more than a decade, quadrupling its profits and becoming one of the most prominent Indian American executives in the United States. Before Mastercard, Mr. Banga worked for more than a decade at Citigroup and at Nestlé in India.
The son of an army general, Mr. Banga has said his upbringing, which involved moving around different cities in India, made him highly adaptable.
"The one thing it did for me more than anything else was this easy adaptability, the willingness to adjust and the willingness to just fit in; I think it's helped me in all my life," Mr. Banga told The Times in 2020.
Mr. Banga has said his experience of being an immigrant to the United States inspired his ambition to bring 500 million people around the world who are "unbanked" into the financial system. Although he had a good income when he moved to the United States in 2000, the fact that he was not yet a citizen with a credit history made it a challenge to even buy a cellphone.
"I call myself financially excluded at that time," Mr. Banga said at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in 2020. "Financial exclusion is not just people who don't have an income."
Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School of international affairs at Tufts University and a former World Bank vice president and climate change envoy, said that while Mr. Banga did not have a deep history of working on climate and fiscal policy, he had strong management skills and a genuine concern about climate change.
"He's a proven C.E.O., he turned Mastercard around and built it into the modern organization that it is, he has a deep commitment to financial inequality and he's in the last few years become very conversant in the climate crisis," Ms. Kyte said in an interview. "Is he a climate activist? No. Has he been working in development for 40 years? No. But does he understand the macro-level investment that needs to happen to make the money flow to green energy instead of brown? Yes. "
The World Bank's board of executive directors met this week to open up the nomination process and lay out the criteria for in its next leader. Those qualities included a proven track record of leadership and accomplishment, particularly in development, and experience managing large international organizations while being familiar with the public sector.
The board of executive directors said it "would strongly encourage women candidates to be nominated."
The bank has never had a woman serve as its permanent president, although Kristalina Georgieva, who is the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, served as acting president in 2019.
Countries have until March 29 to put forward other nominees. The World Bank's board hopes to select a new president by May.
Biden administration officials said they did not know if any other country would offer a nominee and explained that they were able to nominate Mr. Banga so quickly because they had been preparing for the end of Mr. Malpass's term next April. Asked about why the White House did not select a woman, as the executive board suggested, the officials pointed to Mr. Banga's dynamic background and noted that he had a strong track record of promoting gender equality and inclusion within organizations.
"His management record on women will be important for the board to consider since NGOs and others will focus on the missed opportunity to nominate a woman," said Paul M. Cadario, a former senior manager at the World Bank who is now a distinguished fellow at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy.

Although he had a good income when he moved to the United States in 2000, the fact that he was not yet a citizen with a credit history made it a challenge to even buy a cellphone.
“I call myself financially excluded at that time,” Banga said at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in 2020. “Financial exclusion is not just people who don’t have an income.”
Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School of international affairs at Tufts University and a former World Bank vice president and climate change envoy, said that while Banga does not have a deep history of working on climate and fiscal policy, he has strong management skills and a genuine concern about climate change.
“He’s a proven CEO, he turned Mastercard around and built it into the modern organization that it is, he has a deep commitment to financial inequality and he’s in the last few years become very conversant in the climate crisis,” Kyte said in an interview. “Is he a climate activist? No. Has he been working in development for 40 years? No. But does he understand the macro-level investment that needs to happen to make the money flow to green energy instead of brown? Yes.”
The World Bank’s board of executive directors met this week to open up the nomination process and lay out the criteria for in its next leader. Those qualities included a proven track record of leadership and accomplishment, particularly in development, and experience managing large international organizations while being familiar with the public sector.
The board of executive directors said that it “would strongly encourage women candidates to be nominated.”
The bank has never had a woman serve as its permanent president, although Kristalina Georgieva, who is the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, served as acting president in 2019.
Countries have until March 29 to put forward other nominees. The World Bank’s board hopes to select a new president by May.
Biden administration officials said that they did not know if any other country would offer a nominee and explained that they were able to nominate Banga so quickly because they had been preparing for the end of Malpass’ term next April. Asked about why the White House did not select a woman, as the executive board suggested, the officials pointed to Banga’s dynamic background and noted that he has a strong track record of promoting gender equality and inclusion within organizations.
“His management record on women will be important for the board to consider since NGOs and others will focus on the missed opportunity to nominate a woman,” said Paul M. Cadario, a former senior manager at the World Bank who is now a distinguished fellow at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy.

How Multicurrency Accounts Take the Bite Out of Spending Money Abroad

Jet lag aside, almost nothing can dull that post-vacation glow more than a huge credit card bill packed with inscrutable foreign transaction fees.
In April, Lise Boissiere, a frequent traveler, decided she’d had enough of those unexpected buzzkills. Boissiere, who lives in London and works in human resources, decided to follow friends’ advice and open a multicurrency account. These types of accounts allow travelers to exchange their money at more favorable rates and with little to no transaction fees. They can then hold the money in various currencies and spend it using their phone or a card in the currency of whatever country they’re visiting.
Boissiere signed up for Revolut, one of the most popular online providers of these accounts, and was approved in six minutes, she said. Now she uses the Revolut app to pay for everything from croissants in France to Ubers in Spain. “It’s been transformative,” Boissiere said. “I could have saved myself lots of money by using it sooner.”
Tourists traveling abroad have long struggled to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of credit cards, debit cards and currency exchanges — worse rates and lower fees versus better rates and higher fees. Now, multicurrency accounts are changing the calculus.
Even though some credit and debit cards waive foreign transaction fees, multicurrency accounts often have more favorable exchange rates, said Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst with financial advice service Bankrate.com in New York. At the end of January, $10 would get Revolut users 9.21 euros, while Visa customers would get 9.15 euros. But once Visa’s typical 3% foreign transaction fee was factored in, they would get 8.88 euros.
Multicurrency accounts really stand out in contrast to cash, Rossman said. “Those exchange rates can be much worse, especially at airports and in tourist centers,” he said. “I think that’s the legacy model they’re looking to displace.”
Revolut, which currently has 26 million users, is only one of the services that offer these accounts. Other options include Wise (formerly TransferWise), Chime and Monito, as well as more traditional institutions like Citibank, HSBC and East West Bank (though the bigger banks may charge steep monthly fees and have high minimum balance requirements).
Online services like Revolut and Wise have ceilings on how much you can withdraw from ATMs at no charge, and there are limits on how much and when currency exchanges can be made with no fees. These accounts also may not have the fraud and dispute protections of standard credit and debit cards.
Thinking of making one of these accounts part of your next trip? Here’s what you need to know:
How do multicurrency accounts work?
These accounts, which may be used for personal or business purposes, let travelers hold, spend, transfer and toggle between multiple currencies. If you’re using Revolut, for example, you can link your bank account through Apple Pay or Google Pay, load the currency of your home country into your account, and exchange it into 29 currencies — including U.S. dollars, British pounds, euros, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars and South African rand — whenever the rate is favorable. You can add funds to a Revolut account in 17 currencies via bank transfer or debit card as well as with Apple Pay or Google Pay. Other Revolut users can also send you money through the app.
You can spend the money in most multicurrency accounts with either a phone tap or a physical card, which is available at no charge. When you’re making a purchase abroad with Revolut, the app or card defaults to the local currency. If you don’t have enough of that currency in your Revolut account, the service will exchange on the spot at the lowest rate. You can also make a currency exchange via the app at any time to take advantage of an especially favorable rate.
How are they different from regular credit or debit cards?
Many debit and credit cards charge a fee (3% is standard for U.S. and Canadian credit card companies) to use overseas. The multicurrency accounts charge no foreign transaction fees (unless otherwise stated) and use the lowest exchange rates possible. (The services make money on subscriptions as well as the fees that merchants pay on transactions, among other things, Rossman said.)
Where can they be used?
The majority of multicurrency accounts can be used wherever Visa or Mastercard is accepted, said Michael Bodansky, head of corporate communications for Revolut, which is based in London. Currently, anyone living in most areas of North America, Europe, Japan, Singapore or Australia can open a Revolut account. The service is planning to expand to customers in New Zealand, Brazil, Mexico and India soon.
How do you set up an account?
Download the app for the multicurrency account and provide some basic personal information such as your name, address and Social Security number. For most people, it should take no longer than 10 minutes to be approved for any of the apps. If you choose, a card will be mailed to you, but you can start using the Revolut app, which is linked to your bank account via Apple Pay or Google Pay, immediately.
What are the fees?
They vary by the plan you choose and your country of residence. In the United States, Revolut’s standard plan, for example, has no monthly fee and includes exchanges of all currencies up to $1,200 per month at no charge on weekdays and with a 1% fee on the weekends. (If you want to use the app abroad on a weekend without paying a fee, you can transfer into a new currency on a weekday.) If you exchange more than $1,200 per month, there is a fee of 0.5% for additional transfers. You can also make unlimited withdrawals from ATMs in the Allpoint network and up to $1,200 per month without fees outside the network, though the ATM’s owner may still impose a fee. After that, Revolut charges 2% on withdrawals.
Wise — which also has no monthly fee for the base plan and offers 49 currencies — charges a minimal ATM fee depending on where your card was issued. For example, if a Wise account was opened in the United States, you may make two withdrawals of up to $100 total every month with no fees, but after that, Wise charges $1.50 per transaction plus 2% of the total amount withdrawn plus whatever fee the ATM’s owner imposes.
What are the cons?
One major potential drawback is that most credit cards come with fraud and dispute protections, while multicurrency accounts may not, said Wei Zhang, a section chief at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency. And not all the companies that offer multicurrency accounts are licensed banks, though many do team up with banks to offer Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. deposit protection of up to $250,000. Finally, you have to be mindful of how much you withdraw from ATMs to avoid racking up fees, and be aware of the days you’re using the app to avoid weekend exchange charges.

Disney's Iger Is an Old Pro, But This Time Looks Different: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company reports quarterly earnings on Wednesday, and Wall Street is expecting it to lay out a new streaming strategy and operating structure.
When it comes to reporting quarterly earnings, Robert A. Iger is an old pro. He has done it 58 times as Disney's chief executive. But the next one, scheduled for Wednesday, will require him to give a performance for the corporate ages.
"It has to be an impactful, meaningful, tone-setting, agenda-changing day," said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at SVB MoffettNathanson who has followed Disney for 18 years.
Another veteran Disney analyst, Jessica Reif Ehrlich of BofA Securities, agreed. "I don't know that we're going to see answers to everything, but Iger's overall messaging is going to be critical," she said.
So, no pressure.
On Wednesday, Mr. Iger will publicly face Wall Street and Hollywood for the first time since he came out of retirement to retake the reins of a deeply troubled Disney. In late November, the Disney board fired Bob Chapek as chief executive and rehired Mr. Iger, 71, who ran the company from late 2005 to early 2020.
He is also contending with Nelson Peltz, the corporate raider turned activist investor. Mr. Peltz, 80, whose Trian Partners has amassed roughly $ 1 billion in Disney stock and is fighting for a board seat for himself or his son, wants the world's largest entertainment company to revamp its streaming business, refocus on profit growth, cut costs, reinstate its dividend and do a much better job at succession planning.
Most of those things were in motion at Disney before Mr. Peltz started his proxy battle, and analysts expect Mr. Iger to provide updates on at least some fronts on Wednesday.
How are the content pipelines to Disney's streaming services (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+) going to be managed? At 6:30 a.m. on his first day back, Mr. Iger ousted Disney's top streaming executive and ordered a restructuring of a restructuring that Mr. Chapek had put into place.
For months, Disney has been talking about cost cutting and layoffs. Where are they? "This can't drag on," Ms. Ehrlich said. "It's not good for company morale." (Speaking of morale, some Disney employees have been circulating a petition to protest Mr. Iger's decision last month to require everyone to report to the office four days a week.)
Shareholders are increasingly worried about the decline of Disney's traditional television business, which includes ABC and 15 cable networks, led by ESPN, Disney Channel, FX, Freeform and National Geographic. Disney's cable portfolio has held up better than those owned by some rival companies (notably NBCUniversal), but Americans have been cutting the cable cord at an alarming pace -- total hookups declined by a record 6.2 percent from October to December.
"We need an honest and appropriate view of the future of Disney's television business," Mr. Nathanson said. "Is there an asset change? Does spending change? Under Chapek, the messaging was never very clear."
Even in decline, traditional television remains Disney's largest business, delivering $ 8.5 billion in operating income in the fiscal year that ended in October.
Disney and other old-line media companies are facing a simple equation that has proved astoundingly difficult to solve: Profit from traditional television is declining at a faster rate than streaming losses are moderating. In Disney's case, traditional television earnings are expected to decline by $ 1.6 billion in 2023, while losses from streaming will abate by only about $ 900 million, according to Mr. Nathanson.
In November, Disney said losses from its streaming portfolio totaled $ 1.5 billion from July through September, compared with $ 630 million a year earlier.
But Mr. Chapek, who led the company's November earnings call, reiterated a promise that Disney+ would turn a profit by next October. Wall Street has been skeptical of that assertion, and Mr. Iger may revise it on Wednesday, along with guidance that Disney+ would have 215 million to 245 million global subscriptions by 2024. Disney+ currently has about 164 million worldwide.
Companies always try to put the rosiest spin possible on numbers when talking to analysts, shareholders and the news media on quarterly earnings conference calls. But the upbeat tone struck by Mr. Chapek in the November session did not sit well given the numbers that Disney was reporting. Along with widening losses in streaming, Disney had disappointing profit margins at its theme park business and missed Wall Street's overall expectations for both revenue and net income, a rarity for the company. (When one senior Disney executive privately told Mr. Chapek before the call that his planned remarks were too positive, he called her Eeyore, the gloomy donkey from "Winnie the Pooh.")
Mr. Iger will undoubtedly highlight some of Disney's recent achievements. "Avatar: The Way of Water," released by Walt Disney Studios, has generated $ 2.2 billion worldwide since it arrived in theaters on Dec. 16. Disney received more Oscar nominations last month (23) than any other company. Over the end-of-year holidays, Disney's theme parks were gridlocked, easing fears about consumer belt-tightening.
"Despite the macro headwinds, the parks still feel incredibly strong," Ms. Ehrlich said.
But Mr. Iger will also need to contend with a lackluster set of overall numbers, at least if analysts' forecasts are correct. Analysts are expecting per-share earnings of about 79 cents from Disney, down from $ 1.06 a year ago, and revenue of $ 23.4 billion, up from $ 21.8 billion a year ago.
Analysts polled by FactSet estimate that Disney+ will have 163 million subscribers, a slight erosion from the previous quarter.
Mr. Iger will probably not directly address Mr. Peltz's proxy battle, unless an analyst prods him about it. Disney has already made its position clear, saying in a Jan. 17 securities filing that Mr. Peltz had "no strategy, no operating initiatives, no new ideas and no plan."
In a fresh eruption late last week, Trian said there was an "urgent need" for Disney shareholders to drop Michael B.G. Froman from the company's board and give the seat to Mr. Peltz or his son. In response, Disney aggressively defended Mr. Froman, a senior Mastercard executive and former U.S. trade representative who has been a Disney director since 2018.
Some prominent analysts have taken Disney's side.
"He hasn't made a good enough case for why he needs a seat on the board," Mr. Nathanson said, referring to Mr. Peltz.
Richard Greenfield, a founder of the LightShed Partners research firm, was one of Mr. Iger's most ardent critics during his previous tenure at Disney -- so much so that Mr. Iger blocked him on Twitter and refused to take questions from him on earnings calls. Mr. Greenfield, however, recently published an aggressive defense of Disney titled "Disney Would Be Wise to Keep Peltz Off the Jedi Council."
Perhaps Mr. Iger will take a question from Mr. Greenfield on Wednesday.

Full text: The vice president said private companies had pledged almost $ 1 billion to support communities in Central America.
WASHINGTON -- Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday announced almost $ 1 billion in new pledges by private companies to support communities in Central America, part of the Biden administration's effort to keep migrants from fleeing toward the U.S. border.
Ten companies, including Nestle, Target and Columbia Sportswear, said they would collectively spend $ 950 million on projects in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to support farmers, create textile jobs and invest in telecommunications and other industries.
The effort comes as crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border remain at record highs, posing logistical and humanitarian challenges to President Biden and drawing intense criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill.
House Republicans have begun to investigate the administration's efforts at the border and said they might pursue the impeachment of Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary.
The vice president's announcement came on Monday afternoon as she met with a number of companies.
It added to the commitments from businesses through the Partnership for Central America, a nonprofit organization that was created in mid-2021 to facilitate Ms. Harris's efforts to rally support for the region. The partnership had previously announced about $ 3 billion in future spending from a range of companies.
The idea, according to the vice president's aides, is to address what she calls the root causes of migration: poverty, corruption, climate change and political instability that drives people to leave their homes in search of a better life.
Administration officials said the program had already generated results, though they acknowledged on a call with reporters that they could not specifically document that effects. Since mid-2021, officials said, migration from the three countries was down 71 percent.
"As part of this public-private partnership, approximately 47 companies and organizations are collaborating across financial services, textiles and apparel, agriculture, technology, telecommunications and nonprofit sectors to strengthen the region's economic security," the White House wrote in a fact sheet released on Monday.
But even those participating in the effort say there are challenges to its success, especially in the short term.
Ajay Banga, the former executive chairman of Mastercard and one of the business executives who worked with Ms. Harris on the effort to raise money for Central America, said it was unlikely to make a difference in the next few months or even years.
"If anyone speaking to you is declaring victory, they're crazy," Mr. Banga said in November. "There's work. There's real work there. That $ 3 billion is interesting, but it is not implemented yet."
Mr. Banga and others said they had been impressed with Ms. Harris's preparation and well-informed questions behind the scenes on the issue. But he said that the administration's focus on oversight when investing the funds and deterring illegal migration was critical to its success.
"Then this can make a difference over five or 10 years," Mr. Banga said.
There are other challenges, too. People who have worked with the administration for the past year and a half said that private investment was not enough as the United States competes with other countries, especially China, for investment in the region.
Executives with some of the companies who pledged to spend millions of dollars over the course of the next five years or so said they would also need regulatory changes and adjustments to tariffs if they wanted to be successful in the long run.
They will also need infrastructure to support their investments -- roads, internet and power -- and a total scale of spending by other similar companies. Both are things that China has embraced as it spreads investments through Asia, Africa and Latin America.
In response, the administration said on Monday that Ms. Harris would announce a program aimed at increasing investment in infrastructure in the region.
The program aims to help companies gain access to funding from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and will create a Northern Central America Investment Facilitation Team intended to promote economic development.

Bankruptcy Is Possible, Retailer Says: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The home goods retailer said weak sales and slower foot traffic had forced it to consider options for restructuring.
Bed Bath & Beyond, the beleaguered home goods retailer, warned investors on Thursday about rapidly darkening prospects for its future, saying that bankruptcy was a possible option and raising doubts that it could pull off an ambitious turnaround plan it put in place just months ago.
The company could make a decision on its next steps -- including whether to file for bankruptcy -- within weeks, though it is possible the process will take longer, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the process is confidential.
Bed Bath & Beyond, known to many shoppers for its distinctive and seemingly inescapable blue and white coupons, has struggled for years to compete with the likes of Amazon, as more shoppers have gone online for everyday home products.
The retailer laid out a plan in August to turn itself around that included 150 store closings, cost cuts and layoffs. But it needs cash to execute those plans, and it is not clear that the crucial holiday shopping season brought in enough for it to continue without help from outside investors.
"The company has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern," Bed Bath & Beyond said in a statement.
Sue Gove, who became the retailer's permanent chief executive in October, has been focused on working through a restructuring plan to improve the company's ailing supply chain and better stock its stores. But its suppliers remain unconvinced, and it said in a regulatory filing that it was at risk of running out of cash in the coming months.
"Before Christmas, there was just a glimmer of hope," said Neil Saunders, managing director at the retail consulting firm GlobalData. "There was a view that, OK, it's going to be difficult, but maybe they were going to pull through. Things have just got worse."
He added, "They sent out a very clear signal today that they've just run out of time."
Bed Bath & Beyond employed about 32,000 workers as of February and said in October that it had closed about half the stores it planned to as part of its restructuring.
The company, which now has roughly 900 stores across the country, reported preliminary earnings Thursday, noting lower sales and slower foot traffic compared with the previous year. The company said its sales were about $ 1.3 billion for the quarter that ended Nov. 26, about a third lower than the year before, when it had more stores. The period included the run-up to Black Friday.
The retailer estimated that it would record a loss of $ 386 million in its latest quarter, much worse than the $ 276 million loss in the previous year, and said it would need more time than expected to close its books. As of March, Bed Bath & Beyond had roughly $ 3 billion in debt.
The company's share price closed nearly 30 percent lower on Thursday, giving it a market capitalization of $ 150 million. At its peak in 2013, the company's market value was $ 17 billion.
In addition to a possible bankruptcy, Bed Bath & Beyond is exploring a number of options to shore up its balance sheet, including selling pieces or all of the company. To help with those efforts, it is working with advisers at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, the consulting firm Alix Partners and the investment bank Lazard, the two people familiar with the matter said. Alix Partners and Lazard declined to comment. A spokesman for Kirkland did not respond to a request for comment.
"No determinations have been made as of this time," Julie Strider, a Bed Bath & Beyond spokeswoman, said in a statement regarding the retailer's next steps.
Its ability to obtain cash through those means will determine whether it needs to file for bankruptcy.
Bed Bath & Beyond plans to give an update on Tuesday about its efforts to raise cash.
A bankruptcy filing would give Bed Bath & Beyond the chance to shed debt and stores and emerge as a leaner, stronger company, as Neiman Marcus was able to after filing for bankruptcy in 2020. But if performance deteriorates, or its suppliers decide they will not offer their support, Bed Bath & Beyond could be forced to close, like Toys "R" Us.
"What we've seen many times is that it ends up being a stay of execution," Michael Baker, a retail analyst at D.A. Davidson, said. "Sometimes that works, but oftentimes you see an announcement of scaling back and having fewer stores and then that's followed by a complete liquidation."
The attempted turnaround announced in August is being led by Ms. Gove, who at that time was interim C.E.O. after the abrupt departure of the previous chief executive, Mark Tritton, in June.
But transforming a company under the burden of debt payments and the glare of suppliers that have lost their faith can be tricky. Investing in supply chains and merchandising requires money -- and patience.
"Transforming an organization of our size and scale requires time," Ms. Gove said. "We anticipate that each coming quarter will build on our progress."
Ms. Gove said she had spoken to suppliers directly in an attempt to instill confidence. But they have continued to hold back, resulting in lower levels of in-stock items. Supply chain challenges made more severe by China's tough Covid strategy have made suppliers particularly picky about the retailers they sell their product to.
Bed Bath & Beyond has also been trying to win back the support of investors, who have watched as a series of activist investors, including the meme stock favorite Ryan Cohen, have pushed for changes on its board and for the company to consider selling its Buy Buy Baby brand. Mr. Cohen sold his stake in the company in August, pushing its shares down 40 percent.
It has had to grapple with other turmoil. In September, its chief financial officer, Gustavo Arnal, died in what was ruled a suicide. Laura Crossen, the retailer's chief accounting officer, has since been serving as interim financial chief.
Despite Bed Bath & Beyond's bespoke challenges, its debt worries resonate with the broader retail industry. Inflation, rising interest rates and continued supply chain challenges are probably setting up retailers up for a challenging 2023. Consumers were willing to spend this holiday season, with U.S. retail sales up 7.6 percent from the previous period of Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, according to Mastercard Spending Pulse. But how much longer that trend will last is unclear, if the economy tips into a recession, as a number of economists have forecast.
And those who may look to the debt market for reprieve will probably find lenders less eager than they have been in the past two years, when interest rates hovered near zero. Lenders that were previously willing to put money into riskier companies like Bed Bath & Beyond may no longer be willing to take that bet. Supply chain issues worldwide mean companies have less product, not only to sell to customers but to offer lenders as collateral.
For a company in as much financial trouble as Bed Bath & Beyond, "it's very difficult to raise new capital, but it's also difficult to get your current capital providers to want to play ball for a longer period of time," said James Gellert, the chief executive of the financial analytic firm RapidRatings International.
That makes it "really hard for a company like them to claw out of the position that they're currently in."
