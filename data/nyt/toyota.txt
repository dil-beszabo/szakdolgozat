Full text: The value of a possible merger between Honda and Nissan.
Honda and Nissan are exploring a merger that would create one of the world's largest automakers. The tie-up, valued at $ 50 billion, would be the latest consolidation of car companies aimed at sharing the financial burden of developing electric vehicles.
The Japan-based companies formally agreed last Monday to begin talks on combining their operations, with the goal of completing a merger by August 2026. Honda and Nissan sold a combined total of around seven million vehicles last year, a sum behind only Toyota and Volkswagen.
The talks come as more car companies are looking for creative ways to handle research, production and sales of electric vehicles. Automakers have invested billions in E.V. development, financing those efforts primarily through sales of gasoline and hybrid cars. But those efforts have so far failed to generate a profit.
"Current business models are being upended," Toshihiro Mibe, Honda's chief executive, said at a briefing in Tokyo. "It is not going to take 10 to 20 years for that to happen -- it will come much faster."
Gasoline-powered cars generally remain cheaper and more popular in the United States than electric vehicles, and E.V. sales have slowed in the last year, a trend that may continue if President-elect Donald J. Trump removes federal tax credits for buying and leasing electric vehicles.
Some analysts have argued that the merger is necessary for the two automakers to have enough firepower to compete in an increasingly crowded industry. Yet combining two large global operations is incredibly difficult. Past mergers between big auto companies have often failed to achieve their objectives, and this time could be no different, said Thomas Stallkamp, an automotive consultant based in Michigan.
"You try to put two of them together and you run into a lot of egos and infighting, so it's very, very difficult to make it work," Mr. Stallkamp said.
"Union baristas know their value, and they're not going to accept a proposal that doesn't treat them as true partners."
Lynne Fox, the president of Workers United, the union that represents more than 10,000 Starbucks employees, announcing that a strike had expanded to 300 stores nationwide.
"The 7-hour -- and counting -- adventure of rescheduled and delayed flights has resulted in me spending more of Christmas Eve at the D.F.W. Pizza Hut Bar than with my wife, waiting for me in Tucson."
Desmond Zantua of Queens, stuck at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, after American Airlines grounded flights because of a technical glitch and bad weather.
"They have no authorities whatsoever. They don't control the scope of government. They don't control the size of government."
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former chief economist under President George W. Bush, on whether Mr. Trump and his allies can meaningfully cut government spending.

Full text: The tangy smell of Buffalo wings filled Side Chicks Sport Bar, as a dozen electricians crammed their big frames into booths. It was Tuesday night in East Wenatchee, Wash., and "brotherhood night" for the electrical union. Out-of-towners and locals swapped notes on who was coming and going, when new jobs were starting and what drama had gone down with a foreman.
Sean Nickell, 32, and Chris Bennett, 35, sat in a booth below a television blaring a Seattle Mariners baseball game. For years, they had followed each other to job sites around the country without knowing it. "I have just met this man all of a monthish ago, and the parallels are horrifying," Mr. Bennett deadpanned.
They were here to build data centers, the brawny concrete buildings with HVAC systems the size of tractor-trailers that power the new artificial intelligence systems that the tech industry believes are the key to its future -- and perhaps the future of the entire economy.
Electricity is the lifeblood of technology. And perhaps more than any computer technology that has come before it, building A.I. needs vast amounts of computing and the electrical power to make that happen.
So electricians are flocking to regions around the country that, at least for now, have power to spare. These traveling electricians are transforming the sagebrush here in central Washington, with substations going up on orchards and farmland. Hundreds have come to a triangle of counties tied together by hydropower dams along the Columbia River. They are chasing overtime and bonuses, working 60-hour weeks that can allow them to make as much as $ 2,800 a week after taxes.
For all the hype over $ 100,000 chips and million-dollar engineers, the billions pouring into the infrastructure of A.I. is being built by former morticians, retired pro football linebackers, single moms, two dudes described as Gandalf in overalls, onetime bouncers and a roving legend known as Big Job Bob.
A.I. is shaping up to be the kind of economy-bending force that inevitably creates winners and losers. That's true locally, where the construction work will eventually slow down and the region will land on a new normal. But what the new normal turns out to be is anyone's guess.
Mr. Bennett was from Erin, Tenn., a "middle-of-nowhere" town, where an electrician he trained under suggested traveling because he could earn more, build more and see that there was more to this world than just Tennessee.
In central Washington, he makes twice what he could at home. "Our whole M.O. is just to go to a big job like this one, work six days a week, for months at a time, and then actually go home," he says, plowing through a skillet of ranch chicken waffle fries.
In nearby Quincy, where data centers started going up about 15 years ago for the internet boom that came before today's A.I. boom, rumor has it that a local farmer sold his land for a data center and bought three Porsches -- one red, one white, one blue. The agricultural town is rich, though most residents are not. It has a gleaming new high school, built with property taxes that one union official described as "straight-up data center money." Still, four out of five students are eligible for free lunch.
The poverty rate for the district has inched down over the past decade, but how far it goes -- and whether the opportunities outweigh the rising costs of living -- is another open question.
In Washington, the work is all union, a condition of a state tax break that has saved the tech companies almost half a billion dollars. And the electrician union -- the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers -- is stretched: Microsoft alone has said it will need 2,300 electricians in the coming years. The union plans to train hundreds more apprentices.
Mr. Nickell and his wife, a medical imaging technician, have been on the road full time for six years. "We should be able to retire when I'm 43, 45," he shrugged. "Something like that."
By 7:30 p.m., Side Chicks was emptying out. Work started at dawn.
From the Ice Age to the Age of A.I.
Tumbleweeds the size of trash cans blew across the road as Alex Ybarra, a state representative, steered his black S.U.V. through Quincy, population 8,315. His grandparents began cycling through this dead, flat land in the 1950s as farmworkers. Eventually, they stayed. For decades, his mother trimmed potatoes at the French fry factory that supplied McDonald's.
Mr. Ybarra left for college, and eventually came back and worked at the local utility. "See all these streets?" he said, driving past the pink Mexican mercado and under power lines. Many roads were just gravel, "and there was no sidewalks anywhere, even downtown."
That the modern internet would be powered from the sagebrush of central Washington dates back partly to the cataclysmic floods at the end of the last ice age.
As the climate warmed, a miles-wide ice dam on a glacial lake near Missoula, Mont., repeatedly failed, sending water whooshing downhill. With more force than all the world's rivers combined, the water took just two days to haul through Washington and Oregon, bursting out to the Pacific Ocean. The floods carved narrow, vertically walled canyons that provided a tantalizing source of hydropower a century ago.
But the region, sparse and poor, could not afford dams. Around 1955, George Washington's great-great-great-great grandnephew, a lawyer for the utility, helped broker a deal: The region's richer areas helped fund dam construction, but in return locked in cheap hydropower for half a century.
When the deal expired in 2005, the timing could not have been better. The utility could keep more cheap, clean electricity for itself, just as big technology companies were starting to build data centers for their online businesses.
"When the data centers said, 'We need energy,"' Mr. Ybarra recalled, "We said, 'Oh yeah, we got plenty."'
Microsoft bought about 75 acres of bean fields in Quincy the next year.
Matthew Hepner, a union leader, was an apprentice when he was assigned to work at that data center; a straight-up concrete box, not even painted.
But the Great Recession arrived, and work halted.
"I took a job trapping gophers for two bucks a tail to get by," Mr. Hepner said.
Things picked back up about two years later. Yahoo and other tech names set up shop, as did independent data center companies that rented their spaces. One developer used the code name Maserati for their client, but everyone swore it was Microsoft.
Taxes and Schools
In 2006, Washington State enacted its first sales tax break for data centers to encourage construction. For years, there had been handshake agreements to build with union workers, Mr. Hepner said. "It worked for a while, but corporations do what corporations do, trying to cut costs."
When the tax breaks came up again in 2022, "we were like, 'It stops right now or this tax exemption goes away,"' said Mr. Hepner, who had lobbied for the union.
But tax breaks pale in importance to finding power, land and labor. Four of the largest tech companies spent more than $ 200 billion in the last year on capital expenses, largely to build new data centers. They're expected to spend just as much or more next year.
"I can't think of a site selection or placement decision that was decided on a set of tax incentives," said Bo Williams, the executive responsible for Microsoft's data centers in North America.
The data centers spread west from Quincy to the dusty hillsides of East Wenatchee, then, recently, down the Columbia River to tiny Malaga, using transmission lines that fed a shuttered aluminum plant. The three clusters are strategic: Each is in a different county, with its own utility and power supply. There are already about 50 data center buildings, and more than 1,500 electricians working in the region.
Central Washington is just one of dozens of "hot spots" on Where2Bro.com, an unofficial bible for traveling electricians. The site lists gigs in Indiana, Iowa, Georgia, Texas and beyond, all booming as tech companies crawl the electrical grid for supply. Take the note from the union's Local 124, based in Kansas City. "WORK IN LU 124 SHOULD BE EXCELLENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS TO COME," it blared. "WILL NEED HELP FROM OUR TRAVELING BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO MAN IT."
Data centers have substantially increased the total value of property in Quincy, Mr. Ybarra said, "so that means the data centers pay for about 75 percent of all taxes."
Mr. Ybarra, who was on the school board when it proposed a successful $ 108 million bond for construction, pulled up to the high school, an expansive two stories of glass and light wood floors, and wrapped around a courtyard.
Graduation rates are high, but fewer than a third of students go to college, so the school prepares them for trades. They weld in an agricultural fabrication shop and learn stair construction -- and geometry -- at a wood shop. A group of girls were training as wildland firefighters. The weight room has views of apple orchards and there's a community health clinic open to families.
Felicie Becker, the ball-of-energy principal, said she loved the facilities, but more than anything, it was helping recruit great teachers who had never considered a rural district with its many challenges. Most students are poor, and about a third are learning to speak English.
The community is betting that the incredible building can translate to the kind of life-changing education that lifts a family out of poverty.
In Moses Lake, about a 30 minute drive, Mitch Molitor caters to the steady business of traveling workers at Suncrest R.V. Park, which he owns.
The sloping site near the interstate had once been a nine-slide water park, but it went into bankruptcy after its owner, a spud-farmer-turned-Ponzi-schemer, was convicted in a commodities pyramid scheme. It now has a pickleball court. Many residents come from Seattle, where construction has stalled, and return home on weekends. A few bring families -- there's a school bus stop right outside.
Mr. Molitor worries the data centers are a sugar high, with few jobs in the long run. "They use a lot of ground, and they use a lot of power," he said. "I like to see the stuff that makes a bigger return to the community."
A Housing Crunch and Union Jobs
Just after 4:30 p.m. on a Thursday, a sea of hard hats streamed out of a data center built by the developer CyrusOne that everyone seemed to think would be leased by Microsoft. (The tech company will not say.) They poured into the long row of trailers serving as break rooms. Several dozen ended up a few miles away at Monkey N' Around Pizza.
Sharyl Smith, the owner, said the weekly union nights were her "saving grace." She staffed up on Thursdays, so that no one waited on beers, and offered specials to keep customers coming back. This week, it was $ 20 for baby back ribs, corn on the cob, a cornbread muffin and jalapeño mac and cheese. She sold out in 30 minutes.
Nearby, Jesus Zafra, 36, shared a meaty pizza with Juan Ramirez, 28, from Dallas. They met at a data center two years ago, when someone heard that both of their parents were from the Mexican state of Oaxaca.
Mr. Ramirez had left once the snow started falling. "This Texas boy said it was time to go," he drawled. But he had kept up with Mr. Zafra, and was now renting a room for $ 850 from Mr. Zafra's cousin.
It's affordable, given what they make, but wild compared with old Quincy. Over the past year, Douglas County, which includes East Wenatchee, had the greatest home price increases in the entire state. The median home price is $ 519,000, up 18 percent in just one year.
Stacie de Mestre, a director at a regional port authority, said the area was gripped in a housing crisis. "I know everybody says they have one," she said, "but there is truly one here."
As a teen, Mr. Zafra and his grandfather picked rocks out of the fields where data centers now stand. "When our family members would come up to work, you could find a whole house for, like, $ 600," Mr. Zafra said. "Before the data centers."
He checked off the gigs he'd had so far: "Microsoft. Microsoft. Microsoft. Microsoft. Maserati. And then CyrusOne."
It's been good to him. He eats his meals out -- birria burritos from the IGA market's deli counter, carne asada from Rich Tacos. "You see these wiremen driving these nice trucks?" he said. "I'm one of them."
At the bar, one of the first journeymen he trained under, Nate Barrick, was sharing Coronas and shots with a guy who introduced himself as Texas Mike. Before becoming an electrician 16 years ago, Mr. Barrick installed lightning protection, worked as a valet and "sold a lot of drugs." A friend persuaded him to sign up for an apprenticeship, and he forgot all about it. "They called me two months later," he said, "and that's all she wrote."
At a gig in Omaha, he met a teacher online. "She quit and came with me, and she's been subbing everywhere we go," he said.
Around Thanksgiving 2022, Mr. Barrick had been working seven days a week at a data center in Central Oregon until the project shut down overnight. He heard Quincy was hopping, and headed back to Washington. A year ago, they bought a house.
More jobs were posted while everyone ate their pizzas, and Mr. Barrick pulled up the union website. Microsoft had work in East Wenatchee. "So they want 10 guys," he read. "For a year."
Mr. Zafra said he'd had family priced out of Quincy.
"It's sad, you know, but at the same time," he said, "I'm part of the problem too, because I'm working on them."
When Does the Electricity Run Out?
The data centers spew jobs during construction, Mr. Zafra argued, but they employ only several dozen workers once they are up and running.
His buddy Drew Lampe conceded that might be true, but saw no end to the building.
Mr. Zafra disagreed. "There is an end in sight," he said.
"The grid's maxed out," Mr. Zafra stated. "They can't build with no power."
Around here, power is the center of the rumor mill. Everything that can be dammed, already is, so they need more transmission and supply to keep growing.
There's hope that Helion, a nuclear fusion start-up that has a deal with Microsoft, may build its first substation at the Malaga site. Bob Allen, a union representative, heard that Quincy might get a new 500-megawatt transmission line from a federal power authority. "That would give us another 10 years of work," he said.
In late September, word spread through break rooms that Microsoft had signed a deal to fire up the old Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, driving home how their fate was tied to electricity that was increasingly in short supply.
Building more power also requires more electricians. There's a reason the I.B.E.W. runs recruitment ads during N.F.L. games. The union is also expanding its apprenticeship program, which opened an East Wenatchee branch in 2022. But it needs enough work for apprentices to be trained on.
"We're making a commitment -- and I don't have a crystal ball -- to somebody for 8,000 hours, four or five years of their life," said Rob Bartel, the program's cautious director.
"I'll sleep at night, way better, knowing there's jobs," he said.
Mr. Williams of Microsoft said the company had been sharing labor forecasts like never before, to give the union certainty that, "Hey, you know what, a few years down the road we're still going to be building and we still need electricians."
The union sees an opening to diversify: the children of apple pickers, women. Apprentices need a high school degree and a C in Algebra. In the current classes, most were in their late 20s or 30s. They previously worked building forklifts or as a repo man or selling cellphones.
They are paired up with seasoned electricians, each teaching their own personal tricks.
"You get those old-timers," said Aleesa Zyph, a mother of four, "and they're like, 'Stop bending over to do that work! Your body will hate you."'
On a Friday morning, Mr. Nickell and his wife, Becca, were hanging around their R.V. They rented from a local couple -- she wires data centers, he strings power lines -- who installed two hookups in the yard of their rambler.
Growing up, Mr. Nickell's parents did well building zip lines, but he cared only about pole vaulting. After high school, they kicked him out "for being a bum." He slept on the mat at the gym. "My parents told me if I got a job, I could come back," he said.
He recalled enjoying splicing together auxiliary cords to listen to a 1980s stereo, so he found work as a nonunion electrician. He coached at nights, and met Becca, who pole vaulted in college. He started taking jobs on the road and joined the union to make more money.
"It was culture shock to say the least," Mr. Nickell said. Within three days of his first job site, someone peeled an I.B.E.W. sticker off his Toyota Tacoma. An older man from Oklahoma with a big beard and bib overalls explained why he should not drive a foreign vehicle. Now he has a Ford.
Over time, Mr. Nickell found his way, and community. He went to his first brotherhood night at a bar in Indiana, and learned the rules of the road: Put in eight hours of work for eight hours of pay, no more, no less. Do not be a pushover on safety, and do not do more than you're paid for, lest you be considered "wormy."
Over the summer, Mr. Nickell and his wife bought a two-bedroom mobile home off Facebook Marketplace for $ 145,000 near one of the dams. For now, they were renting the rooms out to traveling electricians for $ 600 a month.
They expected to hit the road again, and chase their bucket list of places to work. But they will not be gone long.
"Eventually, we'll move our camper from here and go somewhere else," Mr. Nickell said. "But, we'll still have that to come back to."

Full text: Gone are the days of "Coexist" or "This car climbed Mt. Washington." Bumper stickers have lately gotten a lot weirder, and much more niche.
You can spot them in the parking lot of a grocery store. They catch your eye at a red light or while stuck in traffic. You squint to read: What do they mean by "Former Baby on Board" or "Keep honking I'm eating your girl's pasta fagiole"?
Gone are the days of earnest "Coexist" or "Free Tibet" bumper stickers. Nowadays, they are dipped in irony with a healthy dose of absurdity.
This new crop of bumper stickers are part of a growing trend of merch being made as much to be photographed and shared on social media as they are to be absorbed in the real world. And the buy-in is broad, ranging from the boutique media empire Dirt to the fashion brand J. Crew. You may find them at your favorite bar, or in a wedding gift bag.
"We're known as the bumper sticker couple now, I'm sure," said Brian Gebhart, 32, who, with his fiancée, Alyssa Walker, 30, runs Frog Mustard, one of the most prolific creators of this genre of bumper stickers. They release a handful of new ones each week to their more than 35,000 Instagram followers, whom they call the Frog Army.
The couple started the company last winter, after Mr. Gebhart had a mountain biking accident and needed extra money to pay for a surgery. They came up with Frog Mustard -- a moniker as nonsensical as many of their designs -- by using a random name generator.
Their first designs included a sticker that read "E.T. for City Council" and another with a crying kitten and an appeal to fellow drivers: "Sorry for speeding! But my cat is at home alone!"
By the spring, after a series of viral TikTok posts, the business was growing ever faster. Soon, the couple was investing in an industrial vinyl printer and operating out of their basement home office in Kent, Wash. The business is now a full-time job for Mr. Gebhart, and Ms. Walker maintains a corporate tech job while producing many of the designs.
Frog Mustard now averages 1,200 orders a month with a stock of about 350 designs, they said.
As of late, these include popular stickers like "on my way to get a lobotomy," "I'm pro-sexualizing the green M&M and I vote!" and "Deny, Defend, Depose" (a reference to the killing of the UnitedHealthcare chief executive), among hundreds of others, some of which are the result of ideas people submit through their website. The couple describe their oeuvre as "brain rot stickers."
In American culture, where cars are often seen as physical extensions of their owners' personality, bumper stickers have long been a way to make a vehicle distinctly your own, reflecting your politics and interests. They used to represent earnestness and authenticity: This car really did climb Mount Washington; I do support this presidential candidate; my child actually is an honor student.
"Bumper stickers used to actually say something about the person," said Elizabeth Goodspeed, a graphic designer based in Rhode Island. Now, she said, "they don't tell me anything about the person beyond that they are on the internet."
A few years ago, Christopher DeLoach, an artist in Los Angeles, created a sticker that read "Keep honking! I'm listening to Alice Coltrane's 1971 meteoric sensation 'Universal Consciousness,"' a play on a bumper sticker from the 1980s and '90s: "Keep Honking, I'm Listening to Jazz."
"I wrote the copy in literally one minute," Mr. DeLoach told GQ in 2022.
It went viral on and off bumpers and seemed to touch off a wider phenomenon, giving way to zanier plays on the vintage sticker like "Honk if you have a smooth brain."
In many ways, these stickers are simply memes in real life. While you are likely to spot absurd bumper stickers on streets and highways, you are probably just as likely to come across a photo of one shared on X or Instagram.
"Like memes, they're just designed to be photographed, designed for you to post on your Instagram story," Ms. Goodspeed said.
While the humor of the stickers is closely entangled with the internet, many people reach back in time for inspiration. The ones Nick Singer, a designer and content creator in Keyport, N.J., makes for his shop, the Back Lot, often refer to the slogans and styles of the 1970s and '80s.
Lately, his most popular sticker has been one that reads "Legalize asbestos."
"I just thought, what's the most absurd stance to have?" Mr. Singer, 27, said. "If I had made it 'legalize fracking,' then it would be a political thing. That's an actual issue people discuss. But to want to legalize asbestos is just such an absurd concept that it lightens the mood."
Mr. Singer said his bumper stickers used what he called the semi-ironic humor popular among Generation Z -- which he said made up most of his customer base.
One young driver with whom it resonates is Samuel Hutsell, a transit security guard in Vancouver, Wash. He has three of Mr. Singer's bumper stickers on his Chrysler 300. "When I'm looking in my rearview mirror, I can see people point and chuckle, and it always makes my day," Mr. Hutsell, 20, said.
He said the off-kilter bumper stickers helped set his car apart from other, drabber ones on the road. To him, they appear too sleek.
"Cars in the early 2000s were all bubbly and unique," he lamented. "Nowadays, it's all angular, boxy. They don't feel like cars; they feel like appliances."
Ms. Walker's and Mr. Gebhart's two cars, a Toyota Corolla and a Tacoma, are both covered in bumper stickers, which leads to some funny interactions. Once, when a police officer pulled over Mr. Gebhart for a traffic stop, he asked about a sticker that made a crude but somewhat obscure sexual joke about the founding fathers. Mr. Gebhart was tongue-tied.
"The other night we were sitting at the light, and someone honked," he said of a more recent episode. "I'm like, 'Why are they honking? Oh my God, they're probably honking at my stickers."'

EAST WENATCHEE, Wash. — The tangy smell of Buffalo wings filled Side Chicks Sport Bar, as a dozen electricians crammed their big frames into booths. It was Tuesday night in East Wenatchee, Washington, and “brotherhood night” for the electrical union. Out-of-towners and locals swapped notes on who was coming and going, when new jobs were starting and what drama had gone down with a foreman.
Sean Nickell, 32, and Chris Bennett, 35, sat in a booth below a television blaring a Seattle Mariners baseball game. For years, they had followed each other to job sites around the country without knowing it. “I have just met this man all of a monthish ago, and the parallels are horrifying,” Bennett deadpanned.
They were here to build data centers, the brawny concrete buildings with HVAC systems the size of tractor-trailers that power the new artificial intelligence systems that the tech industry believes are the key to its future — and perhaps the future of the entire economy.
Electricity is the lifeblood of technology. And perhaps more than any computer technology that has come before it, building AI needs vast amounts of computing and the electrical power to make that happen.
So electricians are flocking to regions around the country that, at least for now, have power to spare. These traveling electricians are transforming the sagebrush here in central Washington, with substations going up on orchards and farmland. Hundreds have come to a triangle of counties tied together by hydropower dams along the Columbia River. They are chasing overtime and bonuses, working 60-hour weeks that can allow them to make as much as $2,800 a week after taxes.
For all the hype over $100,000 chips and million-dollar engineers, the billions pouring into the infrastructure of AI is being built by former morticians, retired pro football linebackers, single moms, two dudes described as Gandalf in overalls, onetime bouncers and a roving legend known as Big Job Bob.
AI is shaping up to be the kind of economy-bending force that inevitably creates winners and losers. That’s true locally, where the construction work will eventually slow down and the region will land on a new normal. But what the new normal turns out to be is anyone’s guess.
Bennett was from Erin, Tennessee, a “middle-of-nowhere” town, where an electrician he trained under suggested traveling because he could earn more, build more and see that there was more to this world than just Tennessee.
In central Washington, he makes twice what he could at home. “Our whole MO is just to go to a big job like this one, work six days a week, for months at a time, and then actually go home,” he says, plowing through a skillet of ranch chicken waffle fries.
In nearby Quincy, where data centers started going up about 15 years ago for the internet boom that came before today’s AI boom, rumor has it that a local farmer sold his land for a data center and bought three Porsches — one red, one white, one blue. The agricultural town is rich, though most residents are not. It has a gleaming new high school, built with property taxes that one union official described as “straight-up data center money.” Still, 4 out of 5 students are eligible for free lunch.
The poverty rate for the district has inched down over the past decade, but how far it goes — and whether the opportunities outweigh the rising costs of living — is another open question.
In Washington, the work is all union, a condition of a state tax break that has saved the tech companies almost half a billion dollars. And the electrician union — the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers — is stretched: Microsoft alone has said it will need 2,300 electricians in the coming years. The union plans to train hundreds more apprentices.
Nickell and his wife, a medical imaging technician, have been on the road full time for six years. “We should be able to retire when I’m 43, 45,” he shrugged. “Something like that.”
By 7:30 p.m., Side Chicks was emptying out. Work started at dawn.
From the Ice Age to the Age of AI
Tumbleweeds the size of trash cans blew across the road as Alex Ybarra, a state representative, steered his black SUV through Quincy, population 8,315. His grandparents began cycling through this dead, flat land in the 1950s as farmworkers. Eventually, they stayed. For decades, his mother trimmed potatoes at the French fry factory that supplied McDonald’s.
Ybarra left for college, and eventually came back and worked at the local utility. “See all these streets?” he said, driving past the pink Mexican mercado and under power lines. Many roads were just gravel, “and there was no sidewalks anywhere, even downtown.”
That the modern internet would be powered from the sagebrush of central Washington dates back partly to the cataclysmic floods at the end of the last ice age.
As the climate warmed, a miles-wide ice dam on a glacial lake near Missoula, Montana, repeatedly failed, sending water whooshing downhill. With more force than all the world’s rivers combined, the water took just two days to haul through Washington and Oregon, bursting out to the Pacific Ocean. The floods carved narrow, vertically walled canyons that provided a tantalizing source of hydropower a century ago.
But the region, sparse and poor, could not afford dams. Around 1955, George Washington’s great-great-great-great grandnephew, a lawyer for the utility, helped broker a deal: The region’s richer areas helped fund dam construction, but in return locked in cheap hydropower for half a century.
When the deal expired in 2005, the timing could not have been better. The utility could keep more cheap, clean electricity for itself, just as big technology companies were starting to build data centers for their online businesses.
“When the data centers said, ‘We need energy,’” Ybarra recalled, “We said, ‘Oh yeah, we got plenty.’”
Microsoft bought about 75 acres of bean fields in Quincy the next year.
Matthew Hepner, a union leader, was an apprentice when he was assigned to work at that data center; a straight-up concrete box, not even painted.
But the Great Recession arrived, and work halted.
“I took a job trapping gophers for two bucks a tail to get by,” Hepner said.
Things picked back up about two years later. Yahoo and other tech names set up shop, as did independent data center companies that rented their spaces. One developer used the code name Maserati for their client, but everyone swore it was Microsoft.
Taxes and Schools
In 2006, Washington state enacted its first sales tax break for data centers to encourage construction. For years, there had been handshake agreements to build with union workers, Hepner said. “It worked for a while, but corporations do what corporations do, trying to cut costs.”
When the tax breaks came up again in 2022, “we were like, ‘It stops right now or this tax exemption goes away,’” said Hepner, who had lobbied for the union.
But tax breaks pale in importance to finding power, land and labor. Four of the largest tech companies spent more than $200 billion in the last year on capital expenses, largely to build new data centers. They’re expected to spend just as much or more next year.
“I can’t think of a site selection or placement decision that was decided on a set of tax incentives,” said Bo Williams, the executive responsible for Microsoft’s data centers in North America.
The data centers spread west from Quincy to the dusty hillsides of East Wenatchee, then, recently, down the Columbia River to tiny Malaga, using transmission lines that fed a shuttered aluminum plant. The three clusters are strategic: Each is in a different county, with its own utility and power supply. There are already about 50 data center buildings, and more than 1,500 electricians working in the region.
Central Washington is just one of dozens of “hot spots” on Where2Bro.com, an unofficial bible for traveling electricians. The site lists gigs in Indiana, Iowa, Georgia, Texas and beyond, all booming as tech companies crawl the electrical grid for supply. Take the note from the union’s Local 124, based in Kansas City. “WORK IN LU 124 SHOULD BE EXCELLENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS TO COME,” it blared. “WILL NEED HELP FROM OUR TRAVELING BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO MAN IT.”
Data centers have substantially increased the total value of property in Quincy, Ybarra said, “so that means the data centers pay for about 75% of all taxes.”
Ybarra, who was on the school board when it proposed a successful $108 million bond for construction, pulled up to the high school, an expansive two stories of glass and light wood floors, and wrapped around a courtyard.
Graduation rates are high, but fewer than a third of students go to college, so the school prepares them for trades. They weld in an agricultural fabrication shop and learn stair construction — and geometry — at a wood shop. A group of girls were training as wildland firefighters. The weight room has views of apple orchards and there’s a community health clinic open to families.
Felicie Becker, the ball-of-energy principal, said she loved the facilities, but more than anything, it was helping recruit great teachers who had never considered a rural district with its many challenges. Most students are poor, and about a third are learning to speak English.
The community is betting that the incredible building can translate to the kind of life-changing education that lifts a family out of poverty.
In Moses Lake, about a 30 minute drive, Mitch Molitor caters to the steady business of traveling workers at Suncrest RV Park, which he owns.
The sloping site near the interstate had once been a nine-slide water park, but it went into bankruptcy after its owner, a spud-farmer-turned-Ponzi-schemer, was convicted in a commodities pyramid scheme. It now has a pickleball court. Many residents come from Seattle, where construction has stalled, and return home on weekends. A few bring families — there’s a school bus stop right outside.
Molitor worries the data centers are a sugar high, with few jobs in the long run. “They use a lot of ground, and they use a lot of power,” he said. “I like to see the stuff that makes a bigger return to the community.”
A Housing Crunch and Union Jobs
Just after 4:30 p.m. on a Thursday, a sea of hard hats streamed out of a data center built by the developer CyrusOne that everyone seemed to think would be leased by Microsoft. (The tech company will not say.) They poured into the long row of trailers serving as break rooms. Several dozen ended up a few miles away at Monkey N’ Around Pizza.
Sharyl Smith, the owner, said the weekly union nights were her “saving grace.” She staffed up on Thursdays, so that no one waited on beers, and offered specials to keep customers coming back. This week, it was $20 for baby back ribs, corn on the cob, a cornbread muffin and jalapeño mac and cheese. She sold out in 30 minutes.
Nearby, Jesus Zafra, 36, shared a meaty pizza with Juan Ramirez, 28, from Dallas. They met at a data center two years ago, when someone heard that both of their parents were from the Mexican state of Oaxaca.
Ramirez had left once the snow started falling. “This Texas boy said it was time to go,” he drawled. But he had kept up with Zafra, and was now renting a room for $850 from Zafra’s cousin.
It’s affordable, given what they make, but wild compared with old Quincy. Over the past year, Douglas County, which includes East Wenatchee, had the greatest home price increases in the entire state. The median home price is $519,000, up 18% in just one year.
Stacie de Mestre, a director at a regional port authority, said the area was gripped in a housing crisis. “I know everybody says they have one,” she said, “but there is truly one here.”
As a teen, Zafra and his grandfather picked rocks out of the fields where data centers now stand. “When our family members would come up to work, you could find a whole house for, like, $600,” Zafra said. “Before the data centers.”
He checked off the gigs he’d had so far: “Microsoft. Microsoft. Microsoft. Microsoft. Maserati. And then CyrusOne.”
It’s been good to him. He eats his meals out — birria burritos from the IGA market’s deli counter, carne asada from Rich Tacos. “You see these wiremen driving these nice trucks?” he said. “I’m one of them.”
At the bar, one of the first journeymen he trained under, Nate Barrick, was sharing Coronas and shots with a guy who introduced himself as Texas Mike. Before becoming an electrician 16 years ago, Barrick installed lightning protection, worked as a valet and “sold a lot of drugs.” A friend persuaded him to sign up for an apprenticeship, and he forgot all about it. “They called me two months later,” he said, “and that’s all she wrote.”
At a gig in Omaha, Nebraska, he met a teacher online. “She quit and came with me, and she’s been subbing everywhere we go,” he said.
Around Thanksgiving 2022, Barrick had been working seven days a week at a data center in central Oregon until the project shut down overnight. He heard Quincy was hopping, and headed back to Washington. A year ago, they bought a house.
More jobs were posted while everyone ate their pizzas, and Barrick pulled up the union website. Microsoft had work in East Wenatchee. “So they want 10 guys,” he read. “For a year.”
Zafra said he’d had family priced out of Quincy.
“It’s sad, you know, but at the same time,” he said, “I’m part of the problem too, because I’m working on them.”
When Does the Electricity Run Out?
The data centers spew jobs during construction, Zafra argued, but they employ only several dozen workers once they are up and running.
His buddy Drew Lampe conceded that might be true, but saw no end to the building.
Zafra disagreed. “There is an end in sight,” he said.
“The grid’s maxed out,” Zafra said. “They can’t build with no power.”
Around here, power is the center of the rumor mill. Everything that can be dammed, already is, so they need more transmission and supply to keep growing.
There’s hope that Helion, a nuclear fusion startup that has a deal with Microsoft, may build its first substation at the Malaga site. Bob Allen, a union representative, heard that Quincy might get a new 500-megawatt transmission line from a federal power authority. “That would give us another 10 years of work,” he said.
In late September, word spread through break rooms that Microsoft had signed a deal to fire up the old Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, driving home how their fate was tied to electricity that was increasingly in short supply.
Building more power also requires more electricians. There’s a reason the IBEW runs recruitment ads during NFL games. The union is also expanding its apprenticeship program, which opened an East Wenatchee branch in 2022. But it needs enough work for apprentices to be trained on.
“We’re making a commitment — and I don’t have a crystal ball — to somebody for 8,000 hours, four or five years of their life,” said Rob Bartel, the program’s cautious director.
“I’ll sleep at night, way better, knowing there’s jobs,” he said.
Williams of Microsoft said the company had been sharing labor forecasts like never before, to give the union certainty that, “Hey, you know what, a few years down the road we’re still going to be building and we still need electricians.”
The union sees an opening to diversify: the children of apple pickers, women. Apprentices need a high school degree and a C in Algebra. In the current classes, most were in their late 20s or 30s. They previously worked building forklifts or as a repo man or selling cellphones.
They are paired up with seasoned electricians, each teaching their own personal tricks.
“You get those old-timers,” said Aleesa Zyph, a mother of four, “and they’re like, ‘Stop bending over to do that work! Your body will hate you.’”
On a Friday morning, Nickell and his wife, Becca, were hanging around their RV. They rented from a local couple — she wires data centers, he strings power lines — who installed two hookups in the yard of their rambler.
Growing up, Nickell’s parents did well building zip lines, but he cared only about pole vaulting. After high school, they kicked him out “for being a bum.” He slept on the mat at the gym. “My parents told me if I got a job, I could come back,” he said.
He recalled enjoying splicing together auxiliary cords to listen to a 1980s stereo, so he found work as a nonunion electrician. He coached at nights, and met Becca, who pole vaulted in college. He started taking jobs on the road and joined the union to make more money.
“It was culture shock to say the least,” Nickell said. Within three days of his first job site, someone peeled an IBEW sticker off his Toyota Tacoma. An older man from Oklahoma with a big beard and bib overalls explained why he should not drive a foreign vehicle. Now he has a Ford .
Over time, Nickell found his way, and community. He went to his first brotherhood night at a bar in Indiana, and learned the rules of the road: Put in eight hours of work for eight hours of pay, no more, no less. Do not be a pushover on safety, and do not do more than you’re paid for, lest you be considered “wormy.”
Over the summer, Nickell and his wife bought a two-bedroom mobile home off Facebook Marketplace for $145,000 near one of the dams. For now, they were renting the rooms out to traveling electricians for $600 a month.
They expected to hit the road again, and chase their bucket list of places to work. But they will not be gone long.
“Eventually, we’ll move our camper from here and go somewhere else,” Nickell said. “But, we’ll still have that to come back to.”

Carmakers Talking Merger. History Isn't on Their Side.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Japanese companies are considering joining forces to survive in a rapidly changing auto industry, but auto history is filled with troubled and failed marriages.
The Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan are discussing a possible merger, in a bid to share costs and help themselves compete in a fast-changing and increasingly competitive industry.
But a merger, even of two companies from the same country, is no guarantee of success, and the history of automotive deals is littered with failures and disappointments.
Combining two large, global manufacturing operations is an incredibly difficult feat that involves reconciling different technologies, models and approaches to doing business. A merger's success rests on getting ambitious managers and engineers who have spent decades competing with one another to cooperate. Teams and projects have to be scrapped or changed, and executives must cede power to others. In some cases, the merging companies are hamstrung by elected leaders who force them to keep operating money-losing factories.
Thomas Stallkamp, an automotive consultant based in Michigan, was involved in the struggles of one of the biggest auto mergers, the 1998 merger of Chrysler and the German company Daimler. Mr. Stallkamp spent years in senior roles at Chrysler and DaimlerChrysler.
"Car companies are big, complicated organizations, with large engineering staffs, manufacturing plants all over the world, hundreds of thousands of employees, in a capital-intensive business," Mr. Stallkamp said. "You try to put two of them together and you run into a lot of egos and infighting, so it's very, very difficult to make it work."
Honda and Nissan announced plans this year to work together on electric vehicles, and on Monday they formally began talks about extending that cooperation to a merger that could also include Mitsubishi Motors, a smaller manufacturer that works closely with Nissan. A pairing would unite Japan's second- and third-biggest automakers, after Toyota, and create a company that would be the third largest in the world by number of cars produced, after Toyota and Volkswagen.
The merger discussions were prompted by difficulties the companies are facing around the world.
Chief among those problems is that sales have plummeted in China, the world's largest auto market. Chinese car buyers are moving much more quickly to electric and plug-in hybrid cars and trucks than most industry experts had expected. Honda and Nissan offer few such models, which now account for more than half of all cars sold in China. Companies that are doing the best in the shift away from gasoline cars are domestic manufacturers like BYD and SAIC, as well as Tesla.
Last month, Honda said it expected net profit for the fiscal year ending in March to fall 14 percent, and lowered its forecast for global vehicle sales to 3.8 million from 3.9 million, largely as a result of its difficulties in China, which had once accounted for about a third of its sales.
Nissan has more significant troubles than Honda and in recent years has slogged through management upheaval. In the United States, a critical market where Nissan used to earn significant profits, the company's market share has fallen sharply as it struggles to sell cars and trucks that haven't received significant upgrades in recent years. In the period from April to September, Nissan's operating profit plunged 90 percent, and the automaker recently said it aimed to lose 9,000 employees worldwide and cut global production by about 20 percent.
A merger could help Honda and Nissan develop electric cars faster and at lower cost -- in theory. But other companies have struggled to achieve such gains in practice, often because the priorities of companies working together often shift and diverge. Ford Motor and Volkswagen teamed up a few years ago to work on electric vehicles and autonomous driving technology. But the companies shut down their self-driving car business and reaped few benefits from collaborating on electric vehicles.
Honda had a partnership with General Motors, and currently sells two electric sport utility vehicles, the Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX, that are manufactured by G.M. But the companies have decided not to extend the partnership beyond those two models, and G.M. is now exploring ways to work with Hyundai, the South Korean automaker.
Still, analysts said a merger of Honda and Nissan had the potential to help both companies. In the United States, the two companies have similar product lines focused on small and medium-size cars and sport utility vehicles like Nissan's Sentra, Altima and Rogue and Honda's Civic, Accord and CRV.
Sam Fiorani, a vice president at Auto Forecast Solutions, a research firm, said Nissan had the technology to build full-size pickup trucks bought by many Americans, something Honda lacks. "That's something that could be valuable for Honda in the future," he said.
On the production side, Nissan has two vehicle assembly plants in the United States and Honda has four. Each also has engine and transmission factories and engineering centers.
They could in theory reap savings by combining their operations, closing some plants and locations and eliminating jobs. But that's where the difficulties are likely to arise.
"That means one of the two merger partners is going to gut their development organization or scrap their engine program, and that where you always run into heavy resistance," Mr. Stallkamp said. "When it comes down to it, neither side wants to take the hit."
In many cases, downsizing measures run into political opposition because governments push companies to preserve jobs. Stellantis was formed in a 2021 merger of France's Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler, and the French and Italian governments have fought to keep the combined company from closing factories.
After some initial success, Stellantis this year has suffered a slump in vehicle sales and a drop in profit. The chief executive who helped shepherd the merger, Carlos Tavares, resigned this month. The company, now run by a board committee, is looking for a new top executive and scrapping parts of the strategy it put in place after the merger.
For more than two decades Nissan was the junior partner in an alliance with Renault. The partnership saved Nissan from collapse and helped it become profitable, but neither company saw the kind of long-term success that had been envisioned by Carlos Ghosn, who had led the alliance and served as chief executive of both companies.
Eventually, executives at Nissan chafed at being effectively controlled by Renault. In 2018, Mr. Ghosn was arrested and jailed in Japan on charges of financial wrongdoing. He fled to Lebanon before a trial. Renault still owns a significant stake in Nissan, but the two don't work as closely together as they used to.
DaimlerChrysler faced few battles over closing plants, but struggled to merge a luxury carmaker with an automaker that made more affordable models. The combined company had a balky management structure that included two executives sharing power at the top, and with vast cultural differences between its German and American operations. The two sides separated in 2007 after nine years.
"It was a constant battle of egos on both sides," Mr. Stallkamp said.
Other partnerships that proved disappointing include BMW's takeover of Britain's Rover in the 1990s. Ford owned all or part of Jaguar Land Rover, Mazda and Volvo but sold those assets during and after the 2008 financial crisis.
A few automotive mergers have seemed to live up to expectations. Fiat Chrysler -- formed when Fiat, an Italian automaker, took over Chrysler as the American company was emerging from bankruptcy -- is one example of a merger that seemed to flourish. Under its chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, the Chrysler part of the business, which also included the Dodge, Jeep and Ram brands, recovered and became the more profitable half of the combined company.
The South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia, which have been in an alliance since 1998, are together one of the world's largest automakers and have enjoyed strong growth in recent years. They share development, engineering and manufacturing resources, but have separate sales and marketing operations.
Marc Cannon, a consultant who was a senior executive at AutoNation, a large automotive retailer, said Honda and Nissan could try to emulate Hyundai and Kia, but he expressed doubts about how well the Japanese companies would fare.
"Honda is still a great brand with great products. Nissan's brand has been damaged with all the turmoil they've had in the last few years, and their quality is not great," Mr. Cannon said. "So it doesn't make that much sense to me. Why would Honda be interested in taking on Nissan's problems?"

Full text: Japan's second- and third-largest automakers hope the $ 50 billion deal would help them catch up with Tesla and China's BYD in electric vehicles and advanced software.
Honda Motor and Nissan Motor are exploring a merger to create one of the world's largest auto groups as they seek to better position themselves for the expensive technological transition reshaping the automotive industry.
On Monday, Honda and Nissan signed a memorandum of understanding to formally begin talks aimed at deepening a partnership that began this year. Over the next six months, the companies will discuss combining their operations under a holding company, with the goal of completing the merger in August 2026.
Honda and Nissan, Japan's second- and third-largest automakers, would join a growing number of legacy auto giants, including General Motors and Volkswagen, that are deepening ties to share the financial burden of developing next-generation vehicles. The deal is seen as a lifeline in particular for Nissan, which has been slashing jobs and production amid faltering sales.
Unlike the gasoline-powered cars that have defined the industry for most of the past century, more vehicles today are being equipped with batteries, electric motors and advanced software that enables features such as autonomous driving.
To navigate the change, Honda and Nissan have decided they can better handle research and development and new investments as a combined force, Honda's chief executive, Toshihiro Mibe, said at a briefing in Tokyo on Monday.
"Current business models are being upended. It is not going to take 10 to 20 years for that to happen -- it will come much faster," Mr. Mibe said. "We need to have the right artillery in order to be competitive on that battlefield so we're starting today."
In recent years, automakers across Japan, the United States and Europe have invested billions of dollars into electric vehicle development -- efforts that, for the most part, have yet to generate profits. These investments are being financed by sales of higher-margin gasoline and hybrid models, which also require continuous investment.
With electric vehicle sales growth slowing and President-elect Donald J. Trump gearing up to eliminate E.V. tax incentives in the United States, automakers must figure out how to sustain investments in gasoline- and battery-powered cars for an extended period, said Takaki Nakanishi, head of the automotive consulting firm Nakanishi Research Institute in Tokyo.
"To sustain these dual investments, automakers need scale and the operational efficiencies that come with it," Mr. Nakanishi said. "If Nissan and Honda are not able to achieve this, they will not survive," he said. "Times are truly that tough."
Nissan sells more than three million vehicles a year, while Honda sells nearly four million. A merger would position them as the world's third-largest automaker group, behind Toyota, whose brands sold 11 million vehicles last year, and Volkswagen, which sold nine million. Honda and Nissan together employ about 325,000 people.
Nissan and Honda said integrating their businesses would enable them to standardize the basic makeup of vehicles and increase production. Those steps would reduce how much each company spent on developing vehicles, freeing up cash to spend on things like creating new software.
The key question is whether even large, combined entities like Honda and Nissan can keep up with newer competitors. The American company Tesla and China's BYD have already established a commanding lead in electric vehicles and car technologies that can be updated over the air like smartphones.
Automotive mergers have a long history of failing to meet expectations and ultimately falling apart. DaimlerChrysler split after nine years of a mostly unhappy marriage. Stellantis was formed in the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and the French PSA Group, and the chief executive who helped engineer the pairing, Carlos Tavares, resigned under pressure this month.
Last year, Nissan and its longtime French partner, Renault, agreed to take steps to unwind their alliance. Around the same time, Honda and G.M. decided to scrap a plan to develop a line of lower-priced electric vehicles, less than two years after the companies announced the joint effort.
The new parent company of a merged Honda and Nissan would be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Honda would nominate a majority of the new company's directors, from among which a president would be selected. Mitsubishi Motors, a smaller Japanese automaker and longtime partner of Nissan's, said it would also consider joining the new group.
Under the automakers' current market valuations, the combination would be worth more than $ 50 billion.
The deal is part of a wave of consolidation, which some argue is long overdue, in the Japanese car industry. This year, there has been $ 10 billion in mergers and acquisitions in the sector, up 163 percent from a year earlier, according to Mergermarket, a data provider.
Even with expanded scale, the Japanese automakers would need to prove that their partnership could speed their development of new vehicles, said Tang Jin, a senior researcher at Mizuho Bank. If they cannot create some kind of "chemical reaction" of new value by coming together, he said, "their merging will simply become a gathering of the weak."
Already in China, the world's largest car market, it may be too late for Honda, Nissan and many Western automakers to make up ground lost to cost-competitive and technologically advanced local rivals. For the fiscal year ending March 31, Nissan has projected a 13 percent drop in its sales in China, while Honda expects an even steeper decline.
Nissan's struggles in China contributed to a 90 percent plunge in its operating profit to $ 214 million during the first half of the current fiscal year. Last month, Nissan said it would make deep cuts to its global operations, and in the weeks since, it has been circled by a number of groups including activist investors.
Compared with Nissan, Honda's financial position remains healthy. Honda turned a $ 1.8 billion profit in the July-to-September quarter, but that was down 15 percent from a year earlier because of higher research-and-development costs and weak sales in China.
"Nissan's current decline could very well be Honda's tomorrow," said Mr. Nakanishi, the industry consultant. That is something Honda recognizes. "It realizes its best shot is to combine with Nissan, share a common destiny and try to overcome the impending crisis together," he said.

Still a Few Kinks Before Robots Can Manage the Dinner Rush: [National Desk]

Full text: The robot in the kitchen was upset.
Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.
Steve Ells ignored the noise as he expounded on the future of the restaurant industry (hint: robots!) and how his food chain, Kernel, will play a leading role.
Mr. Ells is best known for starting Chipotle, the burrito giant, in the mid-1990s. Now, with Kernel, which has two locations in New York City and a third on the way, "we are reinventing the kitchen job," he said.
On a warm day in late October, he nibbled on a chicken-salad sandwich that had been partly prepared by a robot that looked as if it might have relatives welding cars at Toyota. The machine was quickly swiveling, extending its arm to remove chicken thighs and carrots from an oven heated to 515 degrees and deposit them on a steel counter where human employees assembled sandwiches and salads before bagging them for customers, also presumably human.
But as the robot continued to beep its displeasure, Mr. Ells stopped speaking, cocked his head and listened carefully as he chewed. "Well, that's a new sound," he said, sighing.
The robot revolution still has some kinks to work out, at least when it comes to cooking.
In recent years, restaurants have dabbled with ways to automate their operations. Labor typically eats up more than a quarter of restaurant chain revenues, so McDonald's and Dunkin' have installed kiosks where customers punch in their orders, reducing the number of cashiers. Others are looking to artificial intelligence programs for drive-through orders or inventory management.
In the post-Covid environment, where restaurant chains continue to struggle with labor shortages and soaring costs as well as orders that come out wrong, many are now seeking ways to automate at least some functions in the kitchen.
Chipotle, where labor costs could reach $ 2.7 billion this year, or a quarter of its revenue, has been testing the Autocado, a machine that can cut, pit and scoop out an avocado in 26 seconds. White Castle has installed a system called Flippy to make fries and other items in 18 locations in the United States.
And Sweetgreen, the fast-casual salad chain, will have an automated salad-making system, the Infinite Kitchen, in about a dozen of its 240 restaurants by the end of this year.
But despite high interest in robots in the kitchen and years of efforts, they have yet to take off.
The beeping that interrupted Mr. Ells's train of thought as he ate lunch turned out to be a reminder to check if supplies needed to be replenished. No big deal, especially compared with the early days, when the brioche buns kept getting stuck in the toaster, shutting the entire cooking system down. The automated system, he explained, was still a work in progress, requiring tweaks here and there. Little did he know that just a few weeks later, a much bigger adjustment would be needed.
Bespoke Barriers to Entry
Unlike car factories or Amazon warehouses, which rely on robots to perform repeatable actions, restaurant kitchens run on multitasking. Flipping pancakes requires a different system from one that dispenses coffee or makes spaghetti. Moreover, producing potentially sticky, gooey or cheesy foods means robots need to be easy to clean to maintain food-safety standards.
"These systems are largely bespoke," said Sharon Zackfia, group head of consumer research at William Blair, rattling off reasons that robots won't replace fry cooks and prep chefs anytime soon.
Moreover, while automated systems may reduce labor costs over time, many have a steep upfront price tag -- typically six figures.
"The restaurant has to have deep pockets," Ms. Zackfia continued. But, she cautioned, "it has to be largely company-owned and not franchised." At a chain like McDonald's or Burger King, franchisees, who own most outlets, would have to bear the costs.
McDonald's opened a nearly fully automated test system at a company-owned restaurant outside Fort Worth in 2022, but executives say it's unlikely that a slew will follow.
"We've spent a lot of time, money, effort looking at this, and there is not going to be a silver bullet that goes and addresses this for the industry," Chris Kempczinski, the chief executive of McDonald's, told analysts and investors on an earnings call in 2022. "The idea of robots and all of those things, while it may be great for garnering headlines, it's not practical for the vast majority of restaurants."
Nor is it easy to squeeze an automated system into already tight kitchens or retrofit an entire kitchen.
Sweetgreen took seven weeks to overhaul its location near Madison Square Garden in New York with an automated system. It is now focusing more on new outlets, where it can build for automation from the start. Of the 40 restaurants the company plans to open in 2025, about half are expected to be automated, at a cost of as much as $ 550,000 each.
In 2021, Sweetgreen acquired Spyce, a Boston-based robot restaurant founded by students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The purchase sped up Sweetgreen's efforts to automate its salad-making.
With the automated Infinite Kitchen, employees still cook chicken and brussels sprouts and slice vegetables. They then feed those ingredients into large containers that dispense the food into bowls on a conveyor belt beneath them. But the system had to be modified so that the conveyor spins the bowls as they move along the line, allowing the individual ingredients to be placed in different parts of the bowl and avoiding a lava-like overflow. Furthermore, the system needed to slice hard-boiled eggs and adjust proportions of the different types of locally grown kale.
Even with all these adjustments, some delicate foods, such as avocados and cooked salmon, are placed in bowls in the final stages by human hands.
"If all it was doing was dispensing almonds into a salad, that would be easy," said Jonathan Neman, a co-founder and the chief executive of Sweetgreen. "But we needed a machine that could be easily set up, cleaned and scaled at a cost that made sense to us, a cost that could be used at all of our locations."
The system is worth it, Sweetgreen executives say. It can churn out 500 bowls in an hour, compared with a top human speed of about 300, and locations using the Infinite Kitchen are considerably more profitable than the average. The automated Sweetgreen in Naperville, Ill., has a restaurant profit margin of more than 31 percent, well above the 20.7 percent average for the chain. (The chain itself has yet to turn a profit, although losses are narrowing.)
A move toward automation in restaurants could save the quick-service industry as much as $ 12 billion a year in wages, the consulting firm Aaron Allen & Associates estimated. Those wages are often meager (the Bureau of Labor Statistics put the median wage for food service workers at $ 14.29 in 2023), but they offer a lifeline for millions of people without a college education or other skills.
Nor can automated systems replace human problem solving or the experience of talking to another person, noted Elyanna Calle, president of the Restaurant Workers United union. "It's just different having a conversation with a human rather than punching buttons on a screen," she said.
'A Wickedly Complicated Endeavor'
When Mr. Ells started Kernel, he and his team looked around for the perfect robot system. When they couldn't find one off the shelf, he brought in Tom Cortese, a co-founder of Peloton, the connected-fitness company, to help create and design the assembly-style system.
Mr. Ells had experience building a brand from scratch. At Chipotle, he expanded the chain to more than 2,350 stores before a number of serious food-safety issues led to his replacement as chief executive in 2017. He stepped down as executive chairman of the board of directors in 2020.
Mr. Ells sees Kernel as a quality fast food chain that, like Chipotle, can grow. But he also views it as an opportunity for the company to license a robotic kitchen system to other restaurants.
"This is the platform of the future for the restaurant industry," he said in October.
The industry's robotic future, however, is going to be a bit delayed. Two months after the lunch, Mr. Ells decided that Kernel and its automated system needed a reboot. Rather than continue to make incremental changes, he said, he is closing the restaurants in a few days "to go to version 2.0." That process is not likely to be completed before March.
"This is a wickedly complicated endeavor, automating restaurant work," Mr. Ells said on a phone call in mid-December. "After 10 months or so with this technology, we have all of this data, and now it's time to build the new system."
The essence of Kernel and its automated system will remain the same, he insisted. The food will still be chopped, seasoned and par-cooked (by humans, who now earn between $ 22 and $ 25 an hour) at a central kitchen in Manhattan and delivered to Kernel's restaurants, where employees load it into the bins, racks and pans that make up the automated system.
The robot will still do much of the heavy lifting, which, at Kernel, involves pulling pans of partly cooked meats and vegetables from racks and placing them in an oven for a few minutes to roast. But Mr. Ells wants the new system to be able to heat larger batches of food, rather than the current one-plate-at-a-time system.
Most of the workers now at Kernel will be out of a job when it shuts down for the reboot. But Version 2.0 of Kernel's kitchen will not eliminate the need for human labor. The robot cannot yet dice, chop or sauté. It can't taste for correct seasoning. It can't make sure the side dishes are in the right bag.
The kitchen, for now, is still mostly the human domain.

Honda and Nissan Weigh Possible Merger: [Correction]

Full text: The merger talks between Japan's second- and third-largest automakers highlight the intense upheaval within the world's auto industry.
Honda Motor and Nissan Motor, Japan's second- and third-largest automakers, are discussing ways to deepen their ties, including the possibility of a merger that could fundamentally restructure Japan's car industry.
The merger talks between the two storied Japanese giants highlight the intense upheaval within the world's auto industry, as carmakers grapple with expensive technological shifts, political instability and the rise of fast-growing Chinese rivals.
Though discussions are still at an early stage, the thinking at Nissan and Honda is that combining forces could provide the companies with the resources and scale necessary to navigate those immense pressures.
Last year, Honda sold 3.98 million vehicles and Nissan 3.37 million. Their combination could make them the world's third-largest automaker group, behind their Japanese rival Toyota Group, which sold 11.23 million vehicles last year, and Volkswagen Group of Germany, which sold 9.23 million.
Honda and Nissan began collaborating this year on the development of electric vehicles. Over several months, their discussions have expanded to include the potential creation of a new company under which both automakers would operate, according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Nissan and Honda are expected to sign a memorandum of understanding within the next week to formally begin discussions of partnership-broadening steps, including the details of a potential merger, the people familiar with the matter said. No final decisions have been made, they said.
The companies said in statements that they were in talks. "As announced in March of this year, Honda and Nissan are exploring various possibilities for future collaboration, leveraging each other's strengths," they said. "We will inform our stakeholders of any updates at an appropriate time."
The possibility of merging forces would have been largely unthinkable for two Japanese titans of auto making just a decade ago. The talks underscore the level of churn in the industry as manufacturers move away from the internal combustion engine, which has powered the vehicles they have produced for most of the past century.
Honda and Nissan each need to invest billions of dollars in electric vehicles, said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, a market research firm.
"Moving forward in E.V.s is expensive, and some of the smaller players have to figure out how to pay for it," she said. "And it's harder than ever now, because sales of E.V.s are growing more slowly than people had expected just a few years ago."
Nissan shares soared more than 20 percent during trading in Tokyo on Wednesday as investors reacted to the news about a potential merger. Honda's shares fell slightly.
Honda, founded in 1948, has long pursued a go-it-alone approach, developing components like engines on its own and spurning globe-spanning alliances. But more recently, the amount of investment required for a shift toward battery-powered vehicles has led it to seek partnerships with companies including Sony in Japan and General Motors in the United States.
Established in 1933, Nissan in particular has struggled in recent years to keep up with the swiftly growing appetite for hybrid gas-electric vehicles in the United States and fully electric cars in China. Last month, Nissan unveiled deep cuts to its global operations and said it needed to take steps to speed up its development of new offerings in its core markets.
Nissan's global sales declined across its core markets -- North America, China and Japan -- in the first half of its fiscal year. During the April-to-September period, its operating profit fell 90 percent, to $ 214 million.
Japanese automakers, like their peers in the United States and Europe, are also facing intense competition from new, highly cost-competitive and technologically advanced rivals in China. After enjoying years of state support, Chinese makers of electric vehicles like BYD are pushing deeper into Europe and Southeast Asia, where Japanese manufacturers have long dominated.
Last year, China overtook Japan for the first time to become the world's largest car exporter. China's exports were boosted by strong demand for electric vehicles and its shipments to Russia, a market that Japanese and Western automakers withdrew from in response to the war in Ukraine.
Like the Western automakers G.M., Ford Motor and Volkswagen, Nissan and Honda have struggled to compete in China as local rivals offer low-cost models tailored to the domestic market, which is the world's largest. Nissan has forecast that its sales in China will fall 13 percent this fiscal year. Honda projected an even larger slump.
As the industry adapts to the new market dynamics, automakers worldwide are forging more alliances. In September, G.M. said it would work with Hyundai of South Korea on internal combustion, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Last month, Volkswagen said it would form a joint venture with the electric vehicle maker Rivian, a California start-up.
People at Honda and Nissan say a partnership could benefit both companies in a number of ways. Honda has a strong portfolio of fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles, and Nissan could help it build out its global supply chain for batteries. Nissan was an early pioneer in electric vehicles and has several popular models, including the Sakura minivehicle it offers in Japan.
Nissan also holds a large stake in Mitsubishi Motors, a smaller Japanese automaker. If a Nissan-Honda group is established, Mitsubishi will consider joining it, according to the Japanese newspaper Nikkei, which earlier reported the merger discussions.
Automotive mergers often fail to deliver the efficiencies and profits that executives hope for. DaimlerChrysler split after nine years of a mostly unhappy marriage. Stellantis was formed in the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and the French PSA Group, and the chief executive who helped engineer the pairing, Carlos Tavares, resigned under pressure this month.
Nissan and the French automaker Renault have been strategic partners for more than two decades, and both saw some benefits early on, but neither achieved the kind of growth and profitability levels that executives and analysts had expected.
Last year, Nissan and Renault agreed to take steps to unwind their alliance. Around the same time, Honda and G.M. decided to scrap a plan to develop a line of lower-priced electric vehicles, less than two years after the companies announced the joint effort.

Automakers Struggle With Market Shift and Competition From China: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Changing technology, political turmoil and competition from China are cutting into profits and forcing carmakers to cut jobs and close factories.
A few years ago, automakers were celebrating record profits as the pandemic created shortages of new cars, allowing them to raise prices. Now the hangover is setting in.
Nissan, the Japanese automaker, is laying off 9,000 employees. Volkswagen is considering closing factories in Germany for the first time. The chief executive of the U.S. and European automaker Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat and other brands, quit after sales tumbled. Even luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz are struggling.
Each carmaker has its own problems, but there are some common threads. They include a tricky and expensive technological transition, political turmoil, rising protectionism and the emergence of a new class of fast-growing Chinese carmakers. The many woes raise questions about the future of companies that are a critical source of jobs in many Western and Asian countries.
Many of these problems have been apparent for years but became less pressing during the pandemic, lulling some automakers into complacency. When shortages of semiconductors and other components slowed production and limited inventory, carmakers found it easy to raise prices.
But that era is over and the industry has reverted to its prepandemic state, with too many carmakers chasing too few buyers.
Many car factories around the world are making many fewer cars than they were built to produce. When automakers don't earn a decent return on their factories and machines, there is "a massive effect on profitability," said Simon Croom, a professor of supply chain management at the University of San Diego. "The difference between profit and loss is a very fine line in the auto industry."
Workers are among the first to suffer in an industry that employs nine million people worldwide in manufacturing, including around a million in the United States. More than two million more Americans work for dealers and related businesses.
Nissan, which has factories in Mississippi and Tennessee, has not detailed where its layoffs will take place. It is not alone in cutting jobs. Ford last month announced 4,000 job cuts, mostly at factories in Britain and Germany. The company cited "unprecedented competitive, regulatory, and economic headwinds."
Ford was partly referring to Chinese carmakers. Barely a factor before the pandemic, they have charged into the international market with cars that can match Japanese, European or American vehicles on quality, at much lower prices.
BYD, Chery, SAIC and other Chinese carmakers are still effectively barred from the United States by trade rules and hobbled by tariffs in Europe. But they are pushing into places like Australia, Brazil, Chile and Thailand, luring buyers away from the likes of Fiat, General Motors and Toyota.
Competition from China is "starting to hit the safe places that Western carmakers had," said Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics, a research firm.
Inside China, the world's largest car market, domestic manufacturers have stolen the limelight from foreign carmakers with over-the-top options like those offered by BYD in its Yangwang U8, a plug-in hybrid off-road vehicle.
The U8 can stay afloat for up to 30 minutes in a flood, according to the company, and its wheels can be set to roll so that the vehicle can rotate 360 degrees while remaining in the same spot.
The rise of Chinese automakers has been particularly tough on German carmakers. Volkswagen gets one-third of its sales from China and once dominated that market. But the company's deliveries there plunged 10 percent in the first nine months of this year, compared with 2023.
BMW and Mercedes-Benz have also reported big sales declines in China recently, which they blamed for lower profits.
American carmakers have also suffered from this shift. G.M. said this month that it would take a more than $ 5 billion hit to its profit as it restructured its Chinese operations, which have been losing money.
Companies that were slow to replace aging models are doing worst. That has been the case for Nissan, Stellantis and even Tesla, which analysts expect to end the year with sales that are roughly unchanged from 2023. Others have struggled to build appealing electric vehicles and develop software, an increasingly important element of car design.
Volkswagen was among the first established carmakers to develop electric vehicles, but the models underwhelmed buyers and critics. Sales in the United States of the company's ID.4 sport-utility vehicle plunged by more than half in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to Kelley Blue Book. Buggy software handicapped sales of the ID.4 and other electric models that Volkswagen sells in Europe and Asia.
"The Chinese are winning market share and the Germans are losing," said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Bochum, Germany. "It's not only the electric cars, it's the software in the cars."
Changing government policy is adding to the carmakers' woes. Sales of electric vehicles plunged in Germany after the government, facing a budget crisis, abruptly eliminated financial incentives.
In the United States, President-elect Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress want to repeal Biden-era tax credits designed to promote electric vehicles. The shifts in policy endanger the hundreds of billions of dollars that G.M., Hyundai-Kia, Volkswagen and others have invested in new factories and cars.
"The auto industry has had to dish out a lot of capital for an underwhelming E.V. market and one that may well change in the next six months," said Erin Keating, an executive analyst at Cox Automotive, a research firm.
Mr. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and Canada. China is an important source of components for virtually all carmakers. Mexico is an important manufacturing center for BMW, G.M., Ford, Stellantis, Volkswagen and others, shipping two million vehicles to the United States in the first nine months of the year.
Not all car companies are doing poorly. G.M. shares have risen more than 40 percent this year, while shares of most automakers have fallen. In part, Wall Street is rewarding G.M. for popular electric vehicles like the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevrolet Equinox. Mary T. Barra, the G.M. chief executive, has said the company is close to making a profit on electric vehicles, unlike other American carmakers excluding Tesla.
But G.M. is also retrenching, announcing last week that it would stop developing robotaxis, autonomous vehicles that can carry passengers without drivers. The decision raised questions about whether established carmakers can compete with Tesla and Waymo, a division of Google's parent company, in the next generation of automotive technology.
Toyota's strategy of doubling down on hybrids, while offering few all-electric cars, also appears to be paying off -- at least for now. Many buyers are choosing hybrids, which cost a lot less than electric vehicles and don't need to be charged, as a way to reduce emissions and fuel expenses.
But Toyota could be left behind if sales of electric vehicles grow faster than market analysts expect. Prices for battery-powered vehicles are dropping while the distance they can travel on a charge is growing. In China, electric vehicles are already cheaper than comparable gasoline models. More than half of new cars sold there are electric or plug-in hybrids.
Carmakers are trying to adapt. Stellantis, whose chief executive, Carlos Tavares, quit this month, has new models lined up for 2025. They include several electric vehicles, among them Jeeps, Ram pickups and a Dodge Charger muscle car. The company is also working to repair its relationship with dealers who feel that Stellantis waited too long to lower prices and offer incentives to help them sell cars that were piling up on their lots.
John Elkann, the chairman of Stellantis, held a virtual meeting with U.S. dealers after Mr. Tavares's resignation. Later, the Stellantis National Dealer Council issued a statement expressing optimism that "2025 will mark a turning point."
Attempts to reach Mr. Tavares for comment were unsuccessful.
Market pressures will prompt carmakers to cooperate with one another more, for example, by sharing the costs of engine development, said K. Venkatesh Prasad, the senior vice president of research at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.
"You're seeing some of this already," he said.
Makoto Uchida, Nissan's chief executive, said last month that the company would reduce the time it takes to develop a new vehicle by working more closely with its partners Renault, Mitsubishi and Honda.
Volkswagen is trying to solve its software problems by investing in Rivian, which makes electric pickups and sport utility vehicles in Illinois.
Western carmakers are also making deals with Chinese automakers. Volkswagen will develop new models with Xpeng to sell in China. Last year, Stellantis bought a 20 percent stake in Leapmotor and has begun selling the Chinese company's electric vehicles in Europe.
"If you can't beat 'em," Mr. Dudenhöffer said, "join 'em."

In Afghan Valley, U.S. Turned Allies Into Foes: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Taliban war hero scans the crowd, searching. From the back, he snatches a man with a flop of dusty hair and a face marred by shrapnel.
The man's head is bowed, and he is missing an arm and an eye. Something has happened to him, something awful.
"This," the Taliban commander says, shaking the man a bit too hard, "was the last ally of the Americans here."
In this remote province, the commander carried out one of the deadliest attacks on U.S. forces in Afghanistan, a pitched battle that sounded an early warning of a conflict terribly off course and altered the history of the war.
Now, years after the Americans abandoned this valley, and Afghanistan altogether, the commander jerks the man from the crowd to explain how the United States lost both.
Clutching the empty arm of his jacket, the commander spins him around like a marionette. The man's sheared limb and ragged scars tell only half the story: His family was killed next to him, massacred as they fled the Taliban.
"This man was my sworn enemy," said the Taliban commander, Mullah Osman Jawhari.
"But do you know who did this to him?" the commander asks, a garish smile spreading over his face.
"It was his friends, the Americans."
Turning Allies into Enemies
When the war in Afghanistan began, there were almost no Taliban here, just a couple of bearded misfits the locals laughed at.
Then U.S. forces showed up, and this valley in Nuristan Province, surrounded by mountains of alpine forest, became the site of some of the most violent attacks on American soldiers since Vietnam.
Historians, journalists and military officials have spent years trying to understand how the Americans lost the valley. Army investigators devoted hundreds of pages to the failures that allowed more than 150 insurgents to nearly overrun a nascent American base in the tiny village of Want in July of 2008, killing nine U.S. soldiers and injuring more than two dozen others.
The battle, waged by one of the most heavily decorated battalions in more than half a century, was "as remarkable as any small unit action in American military history," said one investigator. Still, he blamed the officers for being caught off guard, while another investigator exonerated them, asserting that casualties were the cost of war.
Almost as soon as the United States withdrew, it largely washed its hands of Afghanistan. When former President Donald J. Trump returns to office in January, he will be the first president in a quarter-century who won't be waging the war. To the contrary, he has used it as a political cudgel to blame President Biden for its chaotic end, despite setting the U.S. withdrawal in motion himself during his first term.
Four presidents and more than $ 2 trillion were consumed by America's longest war. Yet the United States has never fully grappled with how it lost its way in Afghanistan, including the glaring intelligence failures that plagued the entire war effort.
The official inquiries into the battle of Want never answered the one question that no military could afford to ignore: How did a valley once free of Taliban become such a hotbed of insurgents? Or, put another way, why did so many of the people who welcomed the Americans suddenly want to kill them?
For more than a year, The New York Times visited villages in the once-inaccessible Waygal Valley, asking locals, Taliban officials and former fighters on both sides of the war for the answer.
By all accounts, the Americans virtually ensured their own defeat: They repeatedly bombed their closest supporters here, showing just how little the United States understood about the war it was fighting.
Civilian casualties are tragically common in war, in Afghanistan or anywhere else. But these attacks were different, residents here say. The Americans killed and maimed the very people who supported them most, swelling the Taliban's ranks by turning allies into enemies.
Convinced that Nuristan would become a transport hub and hide-out for Al Qaeda and its allies, the Americans built bases and aggressively patrolled an area that, for the better part of a century, had been granted autonomy from its own government.
Nuristan was never destined to be a focal point of the war on terror. It is isolated, even by the standards of Afghanistan, a landscape of sheer mountain ridges, snow-capped peaks and river gorges, as beautiful as it is unforgiving.
The British mostly steered clear of the area in their doomed forays into Afghanistan that began in the 1800s. The Russians, in their own failed bid more than a century later, barely entered. Even the Taliban avoided it during their rule in the 1990s.
Only the Americans dared to encroach into the region, and in doing so created the very insurgent stronghold they feared most.
The United States dropped more than 1,000 bombs in a place it never needed to be. Instead of winning hearts and minds, the Americans unwittingly sowed the seeds of their own demise here in the Waygal Valley -- just as it did in much of Afghanistan -- then stayed for years to reap the harvest.
"You have to know when you are the problem," said retired Col. William Ostlund, the commanding officer of the men who fought the battle in Want (sometimes referred to as Wanat).
"We talk about lessons learned but we continuously relearn the lessons learned, and who pays for it?" he asked. "Our young men, who we put in harm's way."
For the Taliban, the battle of Want punctured the myth of American invincibility, proving that hardened resolve could overcome even the greatest superpower.
But there is another lesson, too, whether or not the Americans ever fully learned it: the consequences of trampling blindly into a valley they badly misread.
Today, in an odd echo of history, the Taliban appear to be making some of the same mistakes. They are threatening the valley's independence and risk squandering the good will of its people, much as the Americans did.
War Diaries
The school notebooks sit in bags scattered through the house, their bright jackets like tiny fragments of sky. They are part of Mullah Osman's war menagerie, collected over two decades of conflict: compasses, rusted swords, duct-taped rifle cartridges -- and dozens of light-blue Unicef notebooks.
Inside are the intimate details of his operations, battle plans and budgets: how many men, guns and bullets he assigned to each task. Along the margins are bits of poetry and hand-drawn roses, doodled in the idle hours of war.
This is a history known only to him, the war diaries of a famed Taliban commander.
Tall and rangy with a slender build, Mullah Osman has deep-set eyes and a purple scar above his cheek from a sledding accident, of all things.
Chased for years by the Americans, Mullah Osman vanished not long after the war ended. I tracked him down in his native village of Waygal, in his home of hewed wood and river stone, perched on the edge of a cascading river.
As he flips through the notebooks, he stops on a dog-eared copy: The Battle of Want.
Inside are maps and detailed renderings of the valley and routes into Want, mountain passes where his men smuggled weapons to avoid drone detection. The homes of allies and enemies are marked with Xs; looping arrows sweep up and down the page.
Sensing our interest, Mullah Osman shakes his head. The battle of Want did not start here, he says, pressing the torn cover between his thumb and forefinger.
"It began many years before."
A trail of fire and smoke
The early days brimmed with optimism.
Nobody wanted the backward vision of the Taliban, not when the Americans were offering a bright and shining alternative.
The United States had just knocked the Taliban out of power, and Al Qaeda was on the run. The United States had a small presence in Afghanistan, with limited operations mostly focused on tracking down Osama bin Laden.
It wasn't until 2003, the same year that the Pentagon optimistically declared an end to "major combat" in Afghanistan, that Americans even entered the Waygal Valley looking for Al Qaeda -- and were received with open arms.
During an early patrol in the area, an American soldier fell from the side of the mountain, cascading down a stony chute. Villagers recall bringing him to the home of a local elder, where he was cared for until the Americans could retrieve him.
"The people didn't care that he was an American," Mullah Osman recalled. "They just wanted to help him."
Mullah Osman had no way of convincing them that the Americans were the enemy. He had not been interested in the Taliban, either, until the war began, an affront he said he could not ignore.
His father and uncles had fought the Russians for the same reason. Back then, he was a boy, studying in a madrasa and intent on becoming an Islamic scholar. After the Soviets withdrew, setting off a civil war, Mullah Osman appreciated the Taliban for putting an end to the fighting. But he had no desire to join them until the Americans invaded his country.
At first, almost none of his neighbors understood his outrage. Then, a series of airstrikes hit the valley, changing it forever.
In October 2003, the C.I.A. launched an attack against a suspected terrorist in a mountaintop village, sending a trail of fire and smoke into the ink black sky.
Gunships strafed the forests where residents had run for safety. A cluster of wood-frame homes and a mosque were decimated; seven people were killed, some while fleeing.
The Americans declared the strike a success, a refrain that would become so common it would lose meaning.
In reality, the attacks had failed. Not only was their target not there, but the homes and mosque they struck belonged to a staunch American ally, a former governor of Nuristan named Mawlawi Ghulam Rabbani.
Mr. Rabbani's political party, Jamiat-e-Islami, detested the Taliban -- so much so that it had partnered with the Americans to overthrow them. In fact, that very night, Mr. Rabbani was in Kabul as part of a delegation of pro-American forces.
The only people sheltering in the mountainside home were his family and friends. Of the seven killed, most were women and children, and they included Mr. Rabbani's son and daughter.
These were the early days of war, before civilian deaths from airstrikes became a flashpoint in U.S.-Afghan relations. When U.S. forces came to investigate the damage, one of Mr. Rabbani's surviving sons was there, wandering the scorched hillside, looking for remains.
"They acted like it never happened," the son said recently from the family home. The remnants of the airstrikes still mar the landscape today.
For the rest of his life, the elder Mr. Rabbani would carry the trauma of supporting the very people who had robbed him of his family. Overwhelmed with grief, he would ask anyone he met what his family might have done to deserve such a cruel end.
Though the attack barely resonated in Kabul, much less in Washington, it changed the dynamic in the Waygal Valley. If people were not yet ready to give up on the Americans, they no longer saw them as infallible liberators. A creeping sense of resentment, and injustice, opened a crack for the Taliban's message to grow.
Before the attack, Mullah Osman and Mr. Rabbani had been enemies, the spokesmen for opposing visions of their country's future. But at the funeral for the Rabbani family, Mullah Osman showed up to pay his respects.
He prayed with the family in the smoldering remains of their former mosque. Touched by his outreach, the surviving children gifted him a two-way radio -- a means of communicating across the valley.
"Up to that point, the area was very peaceful. It was safe for everyone, even the American military," Mullah Osman said.
"But after the attack on the Rabbani family," he said, "the Taliban took over. And the uprising began."
'Worse than the Americans'
Young men came out to join Mullah Osman's anemic ranks, driven by bitterness over the Rabbani killings.
Not that the Americans noticed. For the next three years, they largely left Nuristan alone, distracted by the fighting elsewhere in Afghanistan and by the new war in Iraq.
The Americans returned in 2006, convinced that Al Qaeda and its allies were sheltering in the mountains, but the valley had already been transformed. The Taliban was no longer a sideshow.
The Americans started building bases in the valley, giving Mullah Osman exactly what he wanted -- a chance to prove that, whatever development the Americans promised, they would bring death.
And they did. In their search for Al Qaeda, they detained farmers and shepherds, dropped enough bombs to level a mountain and killed innocents, including a vehicle full of teenagers who failed to stop at a checkpoint.
With public outrage growing, Mullah Osman's popularity soared. He took more risks, ambushing foot patrols and lacing the dirt roads with explosives. With each skirmish, he spotted the tendencies and the vulnerabilities of the Americans.
Still, not everyone opposed the Americans. One family in particular stood out as the United States' greatest proponents -- and beneficiaries.
From the moment the Americans arrived, Rafiullah Arif's family embraced them, much as the Rabbanis once had. The family leased the Americans land to build a base, and even offered their sons to assist with security, logistics, whatever needed doing.
Rafiullah, tall with a thick mop of black hair, became a loyal fixer for the Americans, helping with transport and supply and, at least according to Mullah Osman, intelligence gathering.
"These guys were worse than the Americans," Mullah Osman said. "The Americans came for bin Laden, for Al Qaeda. But our own people? What reason did they have?"
Mullah Osman and Rafiullah became sworn enemies in a high-stakes game of local politics with global implications. The more the Americans alienated the people of the Waygal Valley, the closer they grew to the Taliban.
And the closer the locals grew to Mullah Osman, the more the Americans needed allies like Rafiullah.
Self Defeat
Colonel Ostlund arrived in Nuristan in 2007, inheriting the growing hostility toward the United States and the wild, impractical placement of the American bases. He marveled at their remoteness, and how little sense they made.
They had to be resupplied by helicopter in stark ravines where insurgents could fire at them freely and the weather could change in a flash. He worried constantly that a Taliban rocket would down a helicopter loaded with his men.
The mountains ran in excess of 10,000 feet, erupting from the river with such suddenness they nearly eclipsed the sky.
Though Colonel Ostlund and his men had come to fight, they had no desire to do so at such a staggering disadvantage.
By then, Mullah Osman had far more men at his disposal. He organized them in teams of 10, with an imam, a team leader, a spotter with binoculars, a radio man, a gunner -- and a cameraman to record every ambush.
He studied each battle, reviewing the tapes like a football coach. The videos became the centerpiece of his propaganda campaign, shared widely over mobile phones and on social media, evidence of the Taliban's effectiveness against the United States.
But Mullah Osman wanted to do more -- he wanted to overrun an American base and kill everyone inside.
And he almost did.
Nearly one year before the battle of Want, the Taliban stormed a separate base, in August 2007. Mullah Osman's fighters got so close to overrunning it that the Americans had to fight hand-to-hand until air support arrived -- so close that the pilots were forced to bomb the base itself.
Mullah Osman was injured by a grenade in the attack, but no Americans died. Still, the point was clear: The Taliban controlled the valley, and the Americans were on borrowed time.
Mullah Osman ambushed them again about a month later, positioning his men along the foot paths carved into the stony, vertical hillsides. Six Americans were killed, including a platoon leader, a devastating precursor of the violence to come.
By any metric, the sheer amount of combat waged and endured by Colonel Ostlund's men, from the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, was extraordinary. One of the Americans Mullah Osman ambushed, Kyle J. White, was awarded the Medal of Honor.
In their 15-month tour, Colonel Ostlund's men launched more mortars, dropped more bombs and engaged in more firefights in Nuristan and a neighboring province than almost any other unit of the entire war, according to Wesley Morgan, whose book, "The Hardest Place," chronicles the war in the Waygal and surrounding valleys.
But that violence only cemented the population's hostility toward the Americans -- and the growing popularity of the Taliban. Which left the Americans in a curious quagmire: The more they fought, the more violent things became.
"We didn't have an understanding of the people, the culture," Colonel Ostland said. "We didn't really work with people or apologize for the bad things that happened. We got better at that, but it was too late."
The Americans eventually consolidated forces to their base on Rafiullah's family land, in village called Bella, but the Taliban followed. Mullah Osman began launching daily attacks there.
Colonel Ostland was fed up. He wanted to shift his forces to the village of Want, at the mouth of the valley, where it would be easier to defend themselves. He had spent months negotiating with village elders to buy land there and by July of 2008 finally had permission.
But in their haste to leave, the Americans had missed something fundamental: There was nowhere safe for them in the Waygal Valley anymore.
The Last American Ally
Perhaps the only person who stuck by the Americans was Rafiullah.
But his loyalty was growing untenable, and even the money his family was getting increasingly wasn't worth it. Rafiullah and his family couldn't even go to their local market without worrying that Mullah Osman's men would kill them. Now, with the Americans preparing to leave his village, he and his family would be completely unprotected.
The Americans were coming under mortar fire for the second day in a row. Rafiullah and his family decided to leave for good.
They packed up their belongings and fled in a pair of trucks with other civilians, including several doctors who worked at the local clinic.
The fleeing vehicles caught the eye of the Americans, who mistakenly believed the Taliban were marshaling forces for another attack.
U.S. officers called in an airstrike, sending a hail of gunfire from two Apache helicopters at the convoy, destroying them and nearly everyone inside.
Rafiullah lost his father, mother, brother and nephew, along with his arm, an eye and any semblance of support for the U.S. war in Afghanistan.
The Americans, once again, declared the strike a success.
The Battle of Want
Mullah Osman and his men, exhausted from weeks of fighting, retired to the mountains. Under the canopy of a giant tree, Mullah Osman ordered them to go home. They needed rest.
One of his lieutenants objected. The Americans were exposed, and vulnerable.
Why not press the advantage, the lieutenant asked?
After all, the Taliban had fresh manpower -- the Americans themselves had taken care of that. The deaths of Rafiullah's family and the doctors in the convoy had inspired yet another wave of Taliban recruits.
Mullah Osman decided to seize the opportunity. Winning, he had come to believe, was all about the first five minutes.
He knew that the Americans expected brief, hit-and-run attacks. But this time would be different. The Taliban would stand and fight, pressing their advantage in the minutes it took for the Americans to rouse their defense.
In those five minutes, he believed, the entire battle could be won or lost.
Mullah Osman called on more than 150 men from nine villages to prepare. They borrowed weapons from the Taliban in other areas, but also from the local villagers, who were happy to empty their armories for the cause.
To get heavy weapons to Want undetected, they broke down .50-caliber antiaircraft guns, smuggled them over the mountains and reassembled them on hillside perches.
"Want is like a bowl," Mullah Osman explained. On nearly every side, a severe mountain rises from the valley, like a stone amphitheater. "From up there, I could have thrown rocks at the Americans."
The insurgents took their positions at night, roving like ghosts over the narrow footpaths, up and down near-vertical inclines, lugging hundreds of pounds of weaponry on a grueling route that avoided the single road through the valley, which they knew would be monitored by the Americans.
Mullah Osman planted men on the rooftops of buildings just a few yards from the base. He even placed some fighters in trees.
Gunmen lay in wait at the base of the mountains, beneath conifers that offered cover from drones and satellites, and held their positions.
Just after 4 a.m. on July 13, the American soldiers at Want were preparing for a morning patrol when they spotted movement.
The crack of machine gun fire filled the valley as Taliban fighters unloaded magazine after magazine. The whistle and boom of rocket-propelled grenades followed from three directions.
From a boulder balanced in repose on the mountainside, Mullah Osman radioed his men to sustain the attack -- to commit to the five minutes -- because it might be all they had.
He targeted the heavy weapons first: a wire-guided missile system atop a Humvee, which burned like a pyre for the rest of the battle, and a munitions stockpile, which exploded into fiery debris.
Bullets pierced the base from every side. The volume of gunfire stunned the Americans, as did the intimacy of the battle. Opposing fighters were positioned so close they could see one another's faces.
The most withering attack was levied against an American outpost called Topside, set on the hillside above the base. It had been hastily assembled in the days prior, and gave up high ground to the north and west. While most of the Americans were on the main base, only nine men were stationed at Topside.
The first volley was ferocious and accurate, killing, wounding or stunning every man at Topside. And that was just the start. With every wave of grenades and gunfire, the insurgents pressed closer, charging within yards of the outpost.
Realizing the plight of the men at Topside, an American lieutenant and a medic left the main base to help. They rushed through the village and up the hill as gunfire chased them.
The rescue was short-lived. Not long after they entered the outpost, at least one Taliban fighter breached the perimeter, opened fire and killed them both. Eight of the nine Americans who died that day lost their lives at Topside.
An hour into the fight, Apache helicopters came to the Americans' aid. Not long after, planes arrived, along with reinforcements on the ground, shifting the battle decisively.
It is unclear how many Taliban died that day. Mullah Osman claims only three, which is almost certainly a gross understatement. American accounts detail numerous Taliban killed.
Whatever the number, it was a price Mullah Osman and his men were willing to pay.
"In Want, we decided to make a stand against the Americans," the Taliban district governor of Want recalled. "Either kill us, or leave us in peace."
The Americans, for their part, considered the battle of Want a tactical victory. The Taliban retreated, and the soldiers defended their base against a force many times larger than their own.
But a day later, the Americans left Want.
American Retaliation
The American withdrawal was not the final word on Want.
A series of raids and airstrikes followed the American departure. Residents described finding pieces of their children strewn on broken tree limbs.
"Who could commit such cruelty to a man?" one of them said, speaking in little more than a whisper.
Today, the landscape remains a ruin: trees splintered or sparsely regrown, homes cobbled together from the ruins, residents trapped in a trauma loop, as broken as their surroundings.
No one understands that better than Rafiullah.
After the attack on his family, Rafiullah fled the province. But when the Americans withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, he returned home.
The Taliban had claimed power, and granted a nationwide amnesty to their former enemies. They had even returned the land that his family had given the Americans for their base.
Though the Taliban spared his life, it is a half-life, the life of an outcast.
He bites his tongue about the new government; he still fears them. As the Taliban lingered nearby, monitoring his words, he focused his ire on the Americans.
"They say they came here to help us, but they wound up killing us," he said, squinting into the sun with his good eye. "We supported their mission, and they betrayed us."
Peace, and Taxes
The central bazaar buzzes with the sound of new construction, the scrape of concrete and sawing of timber as men huddle on rooftops, planning expansions.
"You can go anywhere in this country and no one will harm you," Mullah Osman brags, sweeping his arm over the village of Want. "Now, the only people complaining are the coffin makers."
At a newly opened stall selling soup by the market, the proprietor screws his face. Yes, he allows, selling soup in Want was not a viable business before the Americans left in 2021. But it's hardly viable now.
"It's safer now, but no one has money these days," he whispers.
Driving out of the village, Mullah Osman stops his convoy at a mosque that hovers perilously over the roaring waters of the Waygal River.
It is prayer time, and others making the journey into the valley join to perform the midday ritual. A Toyota Corolla, out of place for the rugged terrain, pulls in behind him. Three men pile out, dressed in starched clothing and shiny dress shoes typical of a Kabul bureaucrat.
Though the Taliban has changed the upper ranks of government, it still relies heavily on the past government's work force. These particular visitors are from the department of finance.
Mullah Osman stares at the men and asks them what they are doing in Waygal.
"We are registering businesses," one of them responds.
There aren't many: a few roadside shacks selling dusty rolls of cookies and satchels of green tea, a few shepherds with flocks of marble-eyed goats.
The visitors could only mean one thing: taxation. And that would spell the end of a 100-year-old pact to leave the Waygal Valley alone.
Mullah Osman grimaces.
This was once known as Kafiristan, or the land of the nonbelievers. Its people practiced an ancient form of paganism and only converted to Islam in the 1890s, when the emir of Afghanistan conquered the territory and renamed it Nuristan, or the land of the light.
In that conquest, some regions converted peacefully, including the Waygal Valley, and were granted a special status by the emir. According to the locals, they were allowed to retain their resources in perpetuity -- the land, water, minerals and timber. And they would be exempt from taxation.
Mullah Osman is loyal to the Taliban, but to Nuristan most of all.
"I would not support any effort to tax Nuristan," he grumbles as the tax men drive away.
To his mind, he has already made enough concessions. When the new government came to power, they favored clerics over commanders, leaving the fighters who won the war jobless. Including Mullah Osman.
And then there is the amnesty.
For Mullah Osman, that has been both easy and impossible. His son-in-law was an Afghan Special Forces soldier in Kandahar, and still wears his uniform around Mullah Osman's home. He is family, part of the messy and mysterious reconfiguration of alliances that often follows drawn-out conflicts in Afghanistan.
Mullah Osman has also forgiven the Americans, outsiders who never understood Afghanistan. Now that they are gone, so, too, is his enmity toward them.
But others are harder to forgive, like the Afghans who sided with the Americans in Nuristan, who took their money and supported their invasion. People he now must see every day, as though nothing happened.
People like Rafiullah.
Deeper into the valley, Mullah Osman walks through the remains of the American base in Bella, drawing a crowd of villagers as he lists the American atrocities they suffered.
The crowd nods in agreement, and then, suddenly, standing before us, is the last American ally in the valley, a walking casualty of war.
Forbidden from exacting revenge against Rafiullah, Mullah Osman grabs his sleeve and drags him like a prop -- a living monument to American betrayal.
"You must meet my friend Rafiullah," Mullah Osman says.
Turning on the People?
Mullah Osman sat on the matted floor of a Kandahar hotel, watching as a ceiling fan circulated the infernal summer air. He and other Nuristani elders had been granted a rare meeting with Afghanistan's supreme leader, Sheikh Haibatullah Akhundzada.
They had spent weeks rehearsing what to say.
In the months before, the Taliban had formalized the decision to tax Nuristan, an invasive move given the history of the province.
Now, the government was preparing to go further: It had told the people of the valley that it was reclaiming their land, water and mineral rights -- in short, their independence.
Mullah Osman and the others had come in a last-ditch effort to beg the government to reconsider.
"I think this is just a misunderstanding," Mullah Osman said, sounding less optimistic than he wanted to. "We just need to explain."
When the United States launched its doomed foray in the Waygal Valley, it fundamentally misunderstood the place. They built bases where they didn't need to, killed allies and summoned a Taliban presence that had never existed in Nuristan.
It was hard not to wonder whether the Taliban was making a similar mistake now, turning on the very people who had brought them victory.
When Sheikh Haibatullah arrived, dressed in white robes, he joined the Nuristanis on the floor, according to Mullah Osman.
Mullah Osman recounted how he pushed the supreme leader on the fate of Nuristani land. Others chimed in about Nuristani sovereignty, and its history of resistance.
At the end of the meeting, Sheikh Haibatullah promised a written decree granting the land to the people of the Waygal Valley in perpetuity, Mullah Osman recalled. The delegation left elated.
The group returned to Nuristan and waited. And then waited some more. A month passed without a decree. And then many months.
Earlier this year, the Taliban asked him to become the district governor of Waygal, his home village. A return to where it all began.
It was a lesser role than the one he had during the war, but at least it was in Nuristan, the only place that really mattered to him.
"It is better than staying at home," he said.
He has resumed working on a history of Nuristan that he was pondering before the war began -- a chance to review the past and its lessons.
But he is still waiting for the supreme leader's decree.

30-Year Mortgage Rate Drops for Third Week
The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the United States eased for the third week in a row, a welcome trend for prospective home buyers during what is typically a less competitive time of the year for the housing market.
The rate dropped to 6.6 percent from 6.69 percent last week, the mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.95 percent.
Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners seeking to refinance their home loan to a lower rate, also eased this week. The average rate fell to 5.84 percent from 5.96 percent last week.
The average 30-year rate is now at its lowest level since Oct. 24, when it was at 6.54 percent.
Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices have kept homeownership out of reach of many would-be home buyers. Home sales are on track for their worst year since 1995.

COURTS
Trader Gets 12 Years
For Tax Fraud in Denmark
A British hedge fund trader was sentenced by a Danish court to 12 years in prison after being found guilty on Thursday of defrauding the state to the tune of $ 1.3 billion.
The sentence, one of the longest for tax fraud in Danish history, came after a high-profile trial of the trader, Sanjay Shah, right, over trading schemes that drained billions of dollars from the public treasuries of several European countries after the 2008 financial crisis.
The city court found that Mr. Shah, 54, masterminded a scheme that fraudulently secured 9 billion Danish crowns, or $ 1.27 billion, in dividend tax refunds from the Danish treasury between 2012 and 2015.
Mr. Shah, who appeared in court wearing a red Christmas hat, has denied any wrongdoing and argued that he used a legal loophole. He immediately appealed the verdict to the Danish High Court. REUTERS

Toyota Adds Paint Facility To Its Kentucky Plant
Toyota said Thursday it will build a new paint facility as part of a $ 922 million investment at its factory complex in Georgetown, Ky., making it the second big addition announced this year at the auto maker's largest global manufacturing plant.
In February, the company said it would invest $ 1.3 billion at the Kentucky complex, in part so it can build a new three-row electric S.U.V. to be sold in the United States.
Neither project will add any new jobs at the facility, which now employs about 10,000 workers. However, the investments reinforce Toyota's commitment to long-term job stability, the company said.
The new paint facility, scheduled to open in 2027, will add 1 million square feet of capacity while decreasing carbon emissions by 30 percent and water usage by 1.5 million gallons per year, Toyota said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: BYD and other manufacturers are importing cars from China and scouting factory sites in Mexico as part of a global expansion that, for now, excludes the United States.
Behind a crumbling brick wall in a working-class neighborhood of Mexico City lurks a seemingly innocuous car lot. But it could be a sign of a potentially grave threat to the North American auto industry.
A makeshift dealership for the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD has sprung up in this dusty lot. Esteban Alegría, an employee, said the dealership was selling cars as fast as they arrived from China. Mr. Alegría's top seller is the Dolphin Mini, a small but capable four-door electric compact that costs about $ 18,000, about $ 10,000 less than the cheapest battery-powered vehicle available in the United States.
Mr. Alegría's dealership is one of dozens that Chinese carmakers like BYD, Chery, Geely and SAIC are opening up around Mexico as they establish a foothold in North America.
Chinese carmakers are effectively barred from the United States by tariffs that double the sticker price of vehicles imported from China, and they are not yet manufacturing significant numbers of vehicles in Mexico that could be exported across the border.
But their ambition to expand overseas is on vivid display in Mexico and across Latin America, Asia, Europe and Africa. Ads for Chinese brands are in airports and soccer stadiums and loom above Mexico City streets on large billboards. Chinese cars, both gasoline and electric models, are an increasingly common sight.
BYD and others are also looking for places to build factories in Mexico, although none have announced firm plans. Initially, the plants would serve Latin America, part of a campaign by Chinese automakers to erode the dominance of Japanese, American and European carmakers in places like Brazil and Thailand.
But there is little doubt that, eventually, Chinese carmakers hope to use Mexico as an on-ramp to the United States.
"Maybe next year BYD can enter the United States," Mr. Alegría said optimistically, as salsa music blared from a speaker hung on a pole and two men washed the dust from a newly arrived Dolphin. Nearby, workers mortared a cinder block wall, part of a new building that will replace the one-room sales office made of rough bricks topped by a corrugated metal roof.
"If not," Mr. Alegría added, with a smile, "I can deliver."
It is very unlikely that the Dolphin or any other Chinese car brand will be available in the United States soon. Because of the high tariffs, Chinese carmakers have not tried to establish dealerships or get approval from federal regulators to sell in the United States. (BYD does make electric buses in California.)
And someone buying a BYD from a Mexican dealer like Mr. Alegría would have a hard time registering and insuring it in the United States because the cars have not demonstrated that they meet safety standards.
President Biden and President-elect Donald J. Trump have been emphatic about wanting to keep Chinese automakers out of the United States, well aware of the threat they pose to U.S. car and auto parts factories that employ a million workers.
Mr. Trump has threatened 25 percent tariffs on all Mexican products, including cars. Mr. Biden has pursued policies aimed at fending off the challenge from China, including subsidies for U.S. battery factories. The Chinese government has long subsidized carmakers with the goal of becoming a major auto exporter.
But in the years to come it may be difficult to explain to consumers in the United States why they're not allowed to buy inexpensive electric vehicles that are readily available across the border, especially if they're made in Mexico, which already manufactures millions of cars for the United States.
Less than 20 years ago, Chinese cars were widely seen as inferior, even by many Chinese drivers. But in recent years, the country's manufacturers have pulled even with foreign rivals in mechanical quality, analysts say, and often surpass U.S., Japanese and European carmakers in battery technology, autonomous driving and entertainment software. (Think in-car karaoke and rotating touch screens.)
Chinese carmakers have clawed significant market share domestically from once-dominant companies like Volkswagen. Even Tesla, which has a large factory in Shanghai, has lost ground to BYD and other Chinese carmakers. Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, will be in a position to influence U.S. auto and China policy after spending more than $ 250 million to support the Trump campaign and becoming a close adviser to the president-elect.
"Before the pandemic, the rules were set down by the Western carmakers," said Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics, a research firm. "Now it's the opposite."
Representatives of several Chinese carmakers declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. Jorge Vallejo, BYD's director general for Mexico, agreed to an interview but canceled abruptly as New York Times reporters waited outside his office in Mexico City. The company's representative declined to reschedule or make other executives available.
China's car market is the world's largest by far, and the growing prowess of domestic producers is having far-reaching effects. General Motors said on Wednesday that it would take a more than $ 5 billion hit to its profit as it restructured its operations in China, which have been losing money in recent years.
Mary T. Barra, G.M.'s chief executive, acknowledged the price pressure from Chinese carmakers during an interview in October. "We'll continue to look at smart ways to take cost out," she said, while insisting that the company could still compete with China.
Arno Antlitz, the chief financial officer of Volkswagen, noted that the industry had dealt with new competitors before, including Japanese carmakers in the 1970s and South Korean carmakers in recent decades. "We think we have a competitive setup," he said in an interview in October.
Still, the auto industry does not appear to have seen anything like the current wave of Chinese brands, which have quickly overtaken Japanese companies as the world's largest auto exporters.
Chinese carmakers have made deep inroads in countries where they have local production or face few significant trade barriers. In Brazil, Chinese brands have a 9 percent share of car sales, up from 1 percent in 2019. In Thailand, they have 18 percent of the market, up from 5 percent in 2019, according to JATO.
In Mexico, Chinese brands now account for 9 percent of new car sales, up from effectively nothing five years ago.
"They gained market share when other brands didn't have inventory and there were long waits to get cars in Mexico," said Guillermo Rosales Zárate, president of the Mexican Association of Automobile Distributors.
In San Luis Potosí, an industrial hub 250 miles north of Mexico City, BYD models are taking customers from Toyota, said Fernando López, manager of a dealership that sells both brands from a showroom in an upscale neighborhood.
BYD's Shark pickup, a $ 45,000 plug-in hybrid, is poaching buyers from the Toyota Tacoma, he said, while the BYD Song, a $ 30,000 plug-in S.U.V., is luring customers from the Toyota RAV4. The Chinese models cost $ 10,000 less than the comparable Toyotas.
"I don't know if people are going to let them sell in the United States," Mr. López said, referring to BYD, "but they can compete with any brand."
Mexico is the world's seventh-largest auto producer, just behind South Korea and Germany. Most major carmakers have factories in Mexico, including G.M., Ford Motor, Stellantis and Volkswagen. Many use parts from Chinese companies like Minghua, which produces bumpers and other components from a plant next to a large BMW factory outside San Luis Potosí.
Almost 80 percent of vehicles produced in Mexico, more than two million through September, went to the United States, according to the Mexican Automotive Industry Association.
Although U.S. tariffs on cars made in China are high, in theory Chinese cars made in Mexico and exported north of the border would currently have to pay a maximum tariff of just 2.5 percent.
But the United States would probably put pressure on the Mexican government to erect barriers to Chinese automakers. Mexico's new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has played down talk of a BYD factory in Mexico and emphasized that relations with the United States are the government's top priority.
Mexico is "so economically tied to the U.S., at the end of the day this is a straightforward calculation," said Joshua Meltzer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who focuses on international economic relations. In October, the Mexican government raised the tariff on imported cars to 20 percent from 15 percent, in what was widely seen as a reaction to growing sales of Chinese vehicles.
The threat from China will grow as electric vehicles become more popular. Those cars already account for half of all new cars in China, giving the country's carmakers a head start.
Auto executives expect electric vehicles to eventually supplant gasoline and diesel models even if Mr. Trump removes financial incentives for such cars and trucks. G.M., Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and others have staked billions of dollars on electric-car and battery factories.
In Mexico, electric vehicles account for less than 2 percent of new car sales, but have grown more than 40 percent this year despite a dearth of public chargers. Electric vehicles in Mexico City are exempt from restrictions that apply to gasoline and diesel vehicles on days when air pollution is very bad.
That helps the Dolphin Mini, said Daniela Alvarez, a saleswoman at another BYD dealership squeezed into a storefront beneath a Mexico City parking garage.
Ms. Alvarez rattled off the Dolphin's technical specifications, including its advanced battery technology, rotating video display and four airbags. While Chinese electric vehicles still cost more than gasoline models, she said, they cost only 30 percent as much to fuel.
"Electricity is cheaper than gas," she said. "You can make up the difference."

WAYGAL, Afghanistan — The Taliban war hero scans the crowd, searching. From the back, he snatches a man with a flop of dusty hair and a face marred by shrapnel.
The man’s head is bowed, and he is missing an arm and an eye. Something has happened to him, something awful.
“This,” the Taliban commander says, shaking the man a bit too hard, “was the last ally of the Americans here.”
In this remote province, the commander carried out one of the deadliest attacks on U.S. forces in Afghanistan, a pitched battle that sounded an early warning of a conflict terribly off course and altered the history of the war.
Now, years after the Americans abandoned this valley, and Afghanistan altogether, the commander jerks the man from the crowd to explain how the United States lost both.
Clutching the empty arm of his jacket, the commander spins him around like a marionette. The man’s sheared limb and ragged scars tell only half the story: His family was killed next to him, massacred as they fled the Taliban.
“This man was my sworn enemy,” said the Taliban commander, Mullah Osman Jawhari.
“But do you know who did this to him?” the commander asks, a garish smile spreading over his face.
“It was his friends, the Americans.”
Turning Allies into Enemies
When the war in Afghanistan began, there were almost no Taliban here, just a couple of bearded misfits the locals laughed at.
Then U.S. forces showed up, and this valley in Nuristan province, surrounded by mountains of alpine forest, became the site of some of the most violent attacks on American soldiers since Vietnam.
Historians, journalists and military officials have spent years trying to understand how the Americans lost the valley. Army investigators devoted hundreds of pages to the failures that allowed more than 150 insurgents to nearly overrun a nascent American base in the tiny village of Want in July 2008, killing nine U.S. soldiers and injuring more than two dozen others.
The battle, waged by one of the most heavily decorated battalions in more than half a century, was “as remarkable as any small unit action in American military history,” said one investigator. Still, he blamed the officers for being caught off guard, while another investigator exonerated them, asserting that casualties were the cost of war.
Almost as soon as the United States withdrew, it largely washed its hands of Afghanistan. When President-elect Donald Trump returns to office in January, he will be the first president in a quarter-century who won’t be waging the war. To the contrary, he has used it as a political cudgel to blame President Joe Biden for its chaotic end, despite setting the U.S. withdrawal in motion himself during his first term.
Four presidents and more than $2 trillion were consumed by America’s longest war. Yet the United States has never fully grappled with how it lost its way in Afghanistan, including the glaring intelligence failures that plagued the entire war effort.
The official inquiries into the battle of Want never answered the one question that no military could afford to ignore: How did a valley once free of Taliban become such a hotbed of insurgents? Or, put another way, why did so many of the people who welcomed the Americans suddenly want to kill them?
For more than a year, The New York Times visited villages in the once-inaccessible Waygal Valley, asking locals, Taliban officials and former fighters on both sides of the war for the answer.
By all accounts, the Americans virtually ensured their own defeat: They repeatedly bombed their closest supporters here, showing just how little the United States understood about the war it was fighting.
Civilian casualties are tragically common in war, in Afghanistan or anywhere else. But these attacks were different, residents here say. The Americans killed and maimed the very people who supported them most, swelling the Taliban’s ranks by turning allies into enemies.
Convinced that Nuristan would become a transport hub and hideout for al-Qaida and its allies, the Americans built bases and aggressively patrolled an area that, for the better part of a century, had been granted autonomy from its own government.
Nuristan was never destined to be a focal point of the war on terror. It is isolated, even by the standards of Afghanistan, a landscape of sheer mountain ridges, snow-capped peaks and river gorges, as beautiful as it is unforgiving.
The British mostly steered clear of the area in their doomed forays into Afghanistan that began in the 1800s. The Russians, in their own failed bid more than a century later, barely entered. Even the Taliban avoided it during their rule in the 1990s.
Only the Americans dared to encroach into the region, and in doing so created the very insurgent stronghold they feared most.
The United States dropped more than 1,000 bombs in a place it never needed to be. Instead of winning hearts and minds, the Americans unwittingly sowed the seeds of their own demise here in the Waygal Valley — just as they did in much of Afghanistan — then stayed for years to reap the harvest.
“You have to know when you are the problem,” said retired Col. William Ostlund, the commanding officer of the men who fought the battle in Want (sometimes referred to as Wanat).
“We talk about lessons learned, but we continuously relearn the lessons learned, and who pays for it?” he asked. “Our young men, who we put in harm’s way.”
For the Taliban, the battle of Want punctured the myth of American invincibility, proving that hardened resolve could overcome even the greatest superpower.
But there is another lesson, too, whether or not the Americans ever fully learned it: the consequences of trampling blindly into a valley they badly misread.
Today, in an odd echo of history, the Taliban appear to be making some of the same mistakes. They are threatening the valley’s independence and risk squandering the goodwill of its people, much as the Americans did.
War Diaries
The school notebooks sit in bags scattered through the house, their bright jackets like tiny fragments of sky. They are part of Mullah Osman’s war menagerie, collected over two decades of conflict: compasses, rusted swords, duct-taped rifle cartridges — and dozens of light-blue UNICEF notebooks.
Inside are the intimate details of his operations, battle plans and budgets: how many men, guns and bullets he assigned to each task. Along the margins are bits of poetry and hand-drawn roses, doodled in the idle hours of war.
This is a history known only to him, the war diaries of a famed Taliban commander.
Tall and rangy with a slender build, Mullah Osman has deep-set eyes and a purple scar above his cheek from a sledding accident, of all things.
Chased for years by the Americans, Mullah Osman vanished not long after the war ended. I tracked him down in his native village of Waygal, in his home of hewed wood and river stone, perched on the edge of a cascading river.
As he flips through the notebooks, he stops on a dog-eared copy: The Battle of Want .
Inside are maps and detailed renderings of the valley and routes into Want, mountain passes where his men smuggled weapons to avoid drone detection. The homes of allies and enemies are marked with Xs; looping arrows sweep up and down the page.
Sensing our interest, Mullah Osman shakes his head. The battle of Want did not start here, he says, pressing the torn cover between his thumb and forefinger.
“It began many years before.”
A Trail of Fire and Smoke
The early days brimmed with optimism.
Nobody wanted the backward vision of the Taliban, not when the Americans were offering a bright and shining alternative.
The United States had just knocked the Taliban out of power, and al-Qaida was on the run. The United States had a small presence in Afghanistan, with limited operations mostly focused on tracking down Osama bin Laden.
It wasn’t until 2003, the same year that the Pentagon optimistically declared an end to “major combat” in Afghanistan, that Americans even entered the Waygal Valley looking for al-Qaida — and were received with open arms.
During an early patrol in the area, an American soldier fell from the side of the mountain, cascading down a stony chute. Villagers recall bringing him to the home of a local elder, where he was cared for until the Americans could retrieve him.
“The people didn’t care that he was an American,” Mullah Osman recalled. “They just wanted to help him.”
Mullah Osman had no way of convincing them that the Americans were the enemy. He had not been interested in the Taliban, either, until the war began, an affront he said he could not ignore.
His father and uncles had fought the Russians for the same reason. Back then, he was a boy, studying in a madrasa and intent on becoming an Islamic scholar. After the Soviets withdrew, setting off a civil war, Mullah Osman appreciated the Taliban for putting an end to the fighting. But he had no desire to join them until the Americans invaded his country.
At first, almost none of his neighbors understood his outrage. Then, a series of airstrikes hit the valley, changing it forever.
In October 2003, the CIA launched an attack against a suspected terrorist in a mountaintop village, sending a trail of fire and smoke into the ink black sky.
Gunships strafed the forests where residents had run for safety. A cluster of wood-frame homes and a mosque were decimated; seven people were killed, some while fleeing.
The Americans declared the strike a success, a refrain that would become so common it would lose meaning.
In reality, the attacks had failed. Not only was their target not there, but the homes and mosque they struck belonged to a staunch American ally, a former governor of Nuristan named Mawlawi Ghulam Rabbani.
Rabbani’s political party, Jamiat-e-Islami, detested the Taliban — so much so that it had partnered with the Americans to overthrow it. In fact, that very night, Rabbani was in Kabul as part of a delegation of pro-American forces.
The only people sheltering in the mountainside home were his family and friends. Of the seven killed, most were women and children, and they included Rabbani’s son and daughter.
These were the early days of war, before civilian deaths from airstrikes became a flash point in U.S.-Afghan relations. When U.S. forces came to investigate the damage, one of Rabbani’s surviving sons was there, wandering the scorched hillside, looking for remains.
“They acted like it never happened,” the son said recently from the family home. The remnants of the airstrikes still mar the landscape today.
For the rest of his life, the elder Rabbani would carry the trauma of supporting the very people who had robbed him of his family. Overwhelmed with grief, he would ask anyone he met what his family might have done to deserve such a cruel end.
Though the attack barely resonated in Kabul, much less in Washington, it changed the dynamic in the Waygal Valley. If people were not yet ready to give up on the Americans, they no longer saw them as infallible liberators. A creeping sense of resentment, and injustice, opened a crack for the Taliban’s message to grow.
Before the attack, Mullah Osman and Rabbani had been enemies, the spokespeople for opposing visions of their country’s future. But at the funeral for the Rabbani family, Mullah Osman showed up to pay his respects.
He prayed with the family in the smoldering remains of their former mosque. Touched by his outreach, the surviving children gifted him a two-way radio — a means of communicating across the valley.
“Up to that point, the area was very peaceful. It was safe for everyone, even the American military,” Mullah Osman said.
“But after the attack on the Rabbani family,” he said, “the Taliban took over. And the uprising began.”
‘Worse than the Americans’
Young men came out to join Mullah Osman’s anemic ranks, driven by bitterness over the Rabbani killings.
Not that the Americans noticed. For the next three years, they largely left Nuristan alone, distracted by the fighting elsewhere in Afghanistan and by the new war in Iraq.
The Americans returned in 2006, convinced that al-Qaida and its allies were sheltering in the mountains, but the valley had already been transformed. The Taliban was no longer a sideshow.
The Americans started building bases in the valley, giving Mullah Osman exactly what he wanted — a chance to prove that, whatever development the Americans promised, they would bring death.
And they did. In their search for al-Qaida, they detained farmers and shepherds, dropped enough bombs to level a mountain and killed innocents, including a vehicle full of teenagers who failed to stop at a checkpoint.
With public outrage growing, Mullah Osman’s popularity soared. He took more risks, ambushing foot patrols and lacing the dirt roads with explosives. With each skirmish, he spotted the tendencies and the vulnerabilities of the Americans.
Still, not everyone opposed the Americans. One family in particular stood out as the United States’ greatest proponents — and beneficiaries.
From the moment the Americans arrived, Rafiullah Arif’s family embraced them, much as the Rabbanis once had. The family leased the Americans land to build a base, and even offered their sons to assist with security, logistics, whatever needed doing.
Rafiullah, tall with a thick mop of black hair, became a loyal fixer for the Americans, helping with transport and supply and, at least according to Mullah Osman, intelligence gathering.
“These guys were worse than the Americans,” Mullah Osman said. “The Americans came for bin Laden, for al-Qaida. But our own people? What reason did they have?”
Mullah Osman and Rafiullah became sworn enemies in a high-stakes game of local politics with global implications. The more the Americans alienated the people of the Waygal Valley, the closer they grew to the Taliban.
And the closer the locals grew to Mullah Osman, the more the Americans needed allies like Rafiullah.
Self Defeat
Ostlund arrived in Nuristan in 2007, inheriting the growing hostility toward the United States and the wild, impractical placement of the American bases. He marveled at their remoteness, and how little sense they made.
They had to be resupplied by helicopter in stark ravines where insurgents could fire at them freely and the weather could change in a flash. He worried constantly that a Taliban rocket would down a helicopter loaded with his men.
The mountains ran in excess of 10,000 feet, erupting from the river with such suddenness they nearly eclipsed the sky.
Though Ostlund and his men had come to fight, they had no desire to do so at such a staggering disadvantage.
By then, Mullah Osman had far more men at his disposal. He organized them in teams of 10, with an imam, a team leader, a spotter with binoculars, a radio man, a gunner — and a cameraperson to record every ambush.
He studied each battle, reviewing the tapes like a football coach. The videos became the centerpiece of his propaganda campaign, shared widely over mobile phones and on social media, evidence of the Taliban’s effectiveness against the United States.
But Mullah Osman wanted to do more — he wanted to overrun an American base and kill everyone inside.
And he almost did.
Nearly one year before the battle of Want, the Taliban stormed a separate base, in August 2007. Mullah Osman’s fighters got so close to overrunning it that the Americans had to fight hand-to-hand until air support arrived — so close that the pilots were forced to bomb the base itself.
Mullah Osman was injured by a grenade in the attack, but no Americans died. Still, the point was clear: The Taliban controlled the valley, and the Americans were on borrowed time.
Mullah Osman ambushed them again about a month later, positioning his men along the footpaths carved into the stony, vertical hillsides. Six Americans were killed, including a platoon leader, a devastating precursor of the violence to come.
By any metric, the sheer amount of combat waged and endured by Ostlund’s men, from the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, was extraordinary. One of the Americans Mullah Osman ambushed, Kyle J. White, was awarded the Medal of Honor.
In their 15-month tour, Ostlund’s men launched more mortars, dropped more bombs and engaged in more firefights in Nuristan and a neighboring province than almost any other unit of the entire war, according to Wesley Morgan, whose book, “The Hardest Place,” chronicles the war in the Waygal and surrounding valleys.
But that violence only cemented the population’s hostility toward the Americans — and the growing popularity of the Taliban. Which left the Americans in a curious quagmire: The more they fought, the more violent things became.
“We didn’t have an understanding of the people, the culture,” Ostland said. “We didn’t really work with people or apologize for the bad things that happened. We got better at that, but it was too late.”
The Americans eventually consolidated forces to their base on Rafiullah’s family land, in village called Bella, but the Taliban followed. Mullah Osman began launching daily attacks there.
Ostland was fed up. He wanted to shift his forces to the village of Want, at the mouth of the valley, where it would be easier to defend themselves. He had spent months negotiating with village elders to buy land there and by July 2008 finally had permission.
But in their haste to leave, the Americans had missed something fundamental: There was nowhere safe for them in the Waygal Valley anymore.
The Last American Ally
Perhaps the only person who stuck by the Americans was Rafiullah.
But his loyalty was growing untenable, and even the money his family was getting increasingly wasn’t worth it. Rafiullah and his family couldn’t even go to their local market without worrying that Mullah Osman’s men would kill them. Now, with the Americans preparing to leave his village, he and his family would be completely unprotected.
The Americans were coming under mortar fire for the second day in a row. Rafiullah and his family decided to leave for good.
They packed up their belongings and fled in a pair of trucks with other civilians, including several doctors who worked at the local clinic.
The fleeing vehicles caught the eye of the Americans, who mistakenly believed the Taliban were marshaling forces for another attack.
U.S. officers called in an airstrike, sending a hail of gunfire from two Apache helicopters at the convoy, destroying them and nearly everyone inside.
Rafiullah lost his father, mother, brother and nephew, along with his arm, an eye and any semblance of support for the U.S. war in Afghanistan.
The Americans, once again, declared the strike a success.
The Battle of Want
Mullah Osman and his men, exhausted from weeks of fighting, retired to the mountains. Under the canopy of a giant tree, Mullah Osman ordered them to go home. They needed rest.
One of his lieutenants objected. The Americans were exposed, and vulnerable.
Why not press the advantage, the lieutenant asked?
After all, the Taliban had fresh manpower — the Americans themselves had taken care of that. The deaths of Rafiullah’s family and the doctors in the convoy had inspired yet another wave of Taliban recruits.
Mullah Osman decided to seize the opportunity. Winning, he had come to believe, was all about the first five minutes.
He knew that the Americans expected brief, hit-and-run attacks. But this time would be different. The Taliban would stand and fight, pressing their advantage in the minutes it took for the Americans to rouse their defense.
In those five minutes, he believed, the entire battle could be won or lost.
Mullah Osman called on more than 150 men from nine villages to prepare. They borrowed weapons from the Taliban in other areas, but also from the local villagers, who were happy to empty their armories for the cause.
To get heavy weapons to Want undetected, they broke down .50-caliber antiaircraft guns, smuggled them over the mountains and reassembled them on hillside perches.
“Want is like a bowl,” Mullah Osman explained. On nearly every side, a severe mountain rises from the valley, like a stone amphitheater. “From up there, I could have thrown rocks at the Americans.”
The insurgents took their positions at night, roving like ghosts over the narrow footpaths, up and down near-vertical inclines, lugging hundreds of pounds of weaponry on a grueling route that avoided the single road through the valley, which they knew would be monitored by the Americans.
Mullah Osman planted men on the rooftops of buildings just a few yards from the base. He even placed some fighters in trees.
Gunmen lay in wait at the base of the mountains, beneath conifers that offered cover from drones and satellites, and held their positions.
Just after 4 a.m. July 13, the American soldiers at Want were preparing for a morning patrol when they spotted movement.
The crack of machine gun fire filled the valley as Taliban fighters unloaded magazine after magazine. The whistle and boom of rocket-propelled grenades followed from three directions.
From a boulder balanced in repose on the mountainside, Mullah Osman radioed his men to sustain the attack — to commit to the five minutes — because it might be all they had.
He targeted the heavy weapons first: a wire-guided missile system atop a Humvee, which burned like a pyre for the rest of the battle, and a munitions stockpile, which exploded into fiery debris.
Bullets pierced the base from every side. The volume of gunfire stunned the Americans, as did the intimacy of the battle. Opposing fighters were positioned so close they could see one another’s faces.
The most withering attack was levied against an American outpost called Topside, set on the hillside above the base. It had been hastily assembled in the days prior, and gave up high ground to the north and west. While most of the Americans were on the main base, only nine men were stationed at Topside.
The first volley was ferocious and accurate, killing, wounding or stunning every man at Topside. And that was just the start. With every wave of grenades and gunfire, the insurgents pressed closer, charging within yards of the outpost.
Realizing the plight of the men at Topside, a U.S. lieutenant and a medic left the main base to help. They rushed through the village and up the hill as gunfire chased them.
The rescue was short-lived. Not long after they entered the outpost, at least one Taliban fighter breached the perimeter, opened fire and killed them both. Eight of the nine Americans who died that day lost their lives at Topside.
An hour into the fight, Apache helicopters came to the Americans’ aid. Not long after, planes arrived, along with reinforcements on the ground, shifting the battle decisively.
It is unclear how many Taliban died that day. Mullah Osman claims only three, which is almost certainly a gross understatement. American accounts detail numerous Taliban killed.
Whatever the number, it was a price Mullah Osman and his men were willing to pay.
“In Want, we decided to make a stand against the Americans,” the Taliban district governor of Want recalled. “Either kill us, or leave us in peace.”
The Americans, for their part, considered the battle of Want a tactical victory. The Taliban retreated, and the soldiers defended their base against a force many times larger than their own.
But a day later, the Americans left Want.
American Retaliation
The American withdrawal was not the final word on Want.
A series of raids and airstrikes followed the American departure. Residents described finding pieces of their children strewn on broken tree limbs.
“Who could commit such cruelty to a man?” one of them said, speaking in little more than a whisper.
Today, the landscape remains a ruin: trees splintered or sparsely regrown, homes cobbled together from the ruins, residents trapped in a trauma loop, as broken as their surroundings.
No one understands that better than Rafiullah.
After the attack on his family, Rafiullah fled the province. But when the Americans withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, he returned home.
The Taliban had claimed power, and granted a nationwide amnesty to their former enemies. They had even returned the land that his family had given the Americans for their base.
Though the Taliban spared his life, it is a half-life, the life of an outcast.
He bites his tongue about the new government; he still fears it. As the Taliban lingered nearby, monitoring his words, he focused his ire on the Americans.
“They say they came here to help us, but they wound up killing us,” he said, squinting into the sun with his good eye. “We supported their mission, and they betrayed us.”
Peace, and Taxes
The central bazaar buzzes with the sound of new construction, the scrape of concrete and sawing of timber as men huddle on rooftops, planning expansions.
“You can go anywhere in this country and no one will harm you,” Mullah Osman brags, sweeping his arm over the village of Want. “Now, the only people complaining are the coffin makers.”
At a newly opened stall selling soup by the market, the proprietor screws his face. Yes, he allows, selling soup in Want was not a viable business before the Americans left in 2021. But it’s hardly viable now.
“It’s safer now, but no one has money these days,” he whispers.
Driving out of the village, Mullah Osman stops his convoy at a mosque that hovers perilously over the roaring waters of the Waygal River.
It is prayer time, and others making the journey into the valley join to perform the midday ritual. A Toyota Corolla, out of place for the rugged terrain, pulls in behind him. Three men pile out, dressed in starched clothing and shiny dress shoes typical of a Kabul bureaucrat.
Though the Taliban has changed the upper ranks of government, it still relies heavily on the past government’s workforce. These particular visitors are from the department of finance.
Mullah Osman stares at the men and asks them what they are doing in Waygal.
“We are registering businesses,” one of them responds.
There aren’t many: a few roadside shacks selling dusty rolls of cookies and satchels of green tea, a few shepherds with flocks of marble-eyed goats.
The visitors could only mean one thing: taxation. And that would spell the end of a 100-year-old pact to leave the Waygal Valley alone.
Mullah Osman grimaces.
This was once known as Kafiristan, or the land of the nonbelievers. Its people practiced an ancient form of paganism and only converted to Islam in the 1890s, when the emir of Afghanistan conquered the territory and renamed it Nuristan, or the land of the light.
In that conquest, some regions converted peacefully, including the Waygal Valley, and were granted a special status by the emir. According to the locals, they were allowed to retain their resources in perpetuity — the land, water, minerals and timber. And they would be exempt from taxation.
Mullah Osman is loyal to the Taliban, but to Nuristan most of all.
“I would not support any effort to tax Nuristan,” he grumbles as the tax men drive away.
To his mind, he has already made enough concessions. When the new government came to power, it favored clerics over commanders, leaving the fighters who won the war jobless. Including Mullah Osman.
And then there is the amnesty.
For Mullah Osman, that has been both easy and impossible. His son-in-law was an Afghan Special Forces soldier in Kandahar, and still wears his uniform around Mullah Osman’s home. He is family, part of the messy and mysterious reconfiguration of alliances that often follows drawn-out conflicts in Afghanistan.
Mullah Osman has forgiven the Americans, outsiders who never understood Afghanistan. Now that they are gone, so, too, is his enmity toward them.
But others are harder to forgive, like the Afghans who sided with the Americans in Nuristan, who took their money and supported their invasion. People he now must see every day, as if nothing happened.
People like Rafiullah.
Deeper into the valley, Mullah Osman walks through the remains of the American base in Bella, drawing a crowd of villagers as he lists the American atrocities they suffered.
The crowd nods in agreement, and then, suddenly, standing before us, is the last American ally in the valley, a walking casualty of war.
Forbidden from exacting revenge against Rafiullah, Mullah Osman grabs his sleeve and drags him like a prop — a living monument to American betrayal.
“You must meet my friend Rafiullah,” Mullah Osman says.
Turning on the People?
Mullah Osman sat on the matted floor of a Kandahar hotel, watching as a ceiling fan circulated the infernal summer air. He and other Nuristani elders had been granted a rare meeting with Afghanistan’s supreme leader, Sheikh Haibatullah Akhundzada.
They had spent weeks rehearsing what to say.
In the months before, the Taliban had formalized the decision to tax Nuristan, an invasive move given the history of the province.
Now, the government was preparing to go further: It had told the people of the valley that it was reclaiming their land, water and mineral rights — in short, their independence.
Mullah Osman and the others had come in a last-ditch effort to beg the government to reconsider.
“I think this is just a misunderstanding,” Mullah Osman said, sounding less optimistic than he wanted to. “We just need to explain.”
When the United States launched its doomed foray in the Waygal Valley, it fundamentally misunderstood the place. It built bases where it didn’t need to, killed allies and summoned a Taliban presence that had never existed in Nuristan.
It was hard not to wonder whether the Taliban was making a similar mistake now, turning on the very people who had brought them victory.
When Sheikh Haibatullah arrived, dressed in white robes, he joined the Nuristanis on the floor, according to Mullah Osman.
Mullah Osman recounted how he pushed the supreme leader on the fate of Nuristani land. Others chimed in about Nuristani sovereignty, and its history of resistance.
At the end of the meeting, Sheikh Haibatullah promised a written decree granting the land to the people of the Waygal Valley in perpetuity, Mullah Osman recalled. The delegation left elated.
The group returned to Nuristan and waited. And then waited some more. A month passed without a decree. And then many months.
Earlier this year, the Taliban asked him to become the district governor of Waygal, his home village. A return to where it all began.
It was a lesser role than the one he had during the war, but at least it was in Nuristan, the only place that really mattered to him.
“It is better than staying at home,” he said.
He has resumed working on a history of Nuristan that he was pondering before the war began — a chance to review the past and its lessons.
But he is still waiting for the supreme leader’s decree.

You Want It Delivered Today? This Is What It Takes.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Target have figured out that if they get you your online order today, you will probably spend more tomorrow.
One day in early November, I ordered an emotional support pickle. The image on Amazon showed a green crocheted prolate vegetable, with a pink bow fixed on top and two black button eyes. It held a sign that read, "Emotional Support Pickle: I will always be around to let you know that you are a BIG DILL."
I wanted it right away. And my wish seemed attainable.
In the past year, if you've shopped online from one of the big retailers, you've probably noticed new delivery options. You do not have to wait two days or even overnight for your package to arrive. Instead, you can get what you want that very afternoon, between 4 and 8 p.m., if you'd like.
For $ 6.99, I could get a little emotional support during the busy holiday shopping season, which, for a reporter covering the retail industry, is also the busy season. More important, I wanted to understand how it was possible to order a gag gift in the morning and have it arrive before I went to sleep.
Retailers, which have long competed on price or quality, are now in an all-out race for same-day deliveries. Why? Few people truly need the service; if you are desperate for diapers or a special pasta-making attachment, you'll go to the store. But companies have found that, once acquired, the taste for speedy delivery makes customers both loyal and willing to spend more money.
"Customers love fast delivery, and the faster we deliver, the more often customers come back," said Sarah Mathew, a vice president for delivery experience at Amazon. "It doesn't sound like rocket science, but that was really the aha of 'Oh, we should really continue to invest here."'
Amazon set the standard for speed. For years, Amazon's Prime membership, which now costs $ 139 a year, came with two-day shipping. Then in April 2019, it announced that next-day delivery would be the new normal. Almost immediately, sales growth picked up steam.
Retailers like Walmart joined the race, and found they had an advantage: physical stores close to doorsteps. Walmart, which last year started offering customers deliveries in as little as 30 minutes, says it can now offer same-day delivery to 86 percent of all U.S. households from its 4,600 stores. In November, Walmart's chief financial officer said deliveries from stores were up nearly 50 percent from a year earlier and accounted for $ 2.5 billion in sales in each of the previous 12 consecutive months. Sales on delivered items grew faster than sales in stores.
Target also uses the merchandise in its stores to get same-day orders to customers' homes. And average shipping times for all orders are nearly a day faster than they were a year ago, Target's chief operating officer said last month, helped by sortation centers, which rely on products from its stores and Shipt, a delivery service it purchased in 2017.
Amazon doesn't have thousands of stores near shoppers. So it has tried other techniques. The company introduced drone delivery that could get packages to customers in Texas and Arizona within an hour. There were limits: The item had to be under five pounds. Standing kitchen mixer emergency? Forget it.
In 2023, the company redesigned its U.S. fulfillment network, breaking its nationwide system into eight regions. That meant more products would be closer to more customers, making deliveries faster and cheaper because they had to cover less distance.
The company also shaved time by opening same-day facilities, which combine a warehouse and a delivery depot into one structure. There are more than 55 of these facilities.
With the holiday shopping season in full swing, that speed will be put to the test. On Cyber Monday, consumers spent $ 13.3 billion, a 7.3 percent increase from last year.
To see Amazon's same-day delivery "on steroids," as Ms. Mathew put it, I toured one of the company's newest same-day facilities.
I also saw where the company's ambitions to deliver your desires at superhero speed hit some bumps, depending on where you live. The company has same-day delivery to 120 metro areas and is building same-day facilities "where the demand is," Ms. Mathew said. But even within high-demand areas, the system has snafus.
I found this out trying to get my nonedible pickle delivered to my apartment in Brooklyn. "Unbeknownst to you," said Marc Wulfraat, an industry consultant who closely tracks Amazon's facilities, "you stumbled upon a complicated complex."
Or, as Zac Rogers, a professor of operations and supply chain management at Colorado State University, told me, Amazon's same-day delivery "works sort of through a combination basically of elegant innovation and brute force scale."
A New York-Chicago Challenge
Around 11 a.m. on Nov. 7, I tried to order my emotional support pickle. The page responded with a cheery "Thank you for loving same-day delivery this much!" before giving me the bad news: All the same-day delivery offers had been claimed for the day. I should come back tomorrow.
Instead of getting a pickle, I was in one. I vowed to try again.
The next morning, I logged on before 7, surely early enough to grab a slot before everything had been spoken for. But I received the same message. I started changing delivery addresses to see if that would make a difference, eventually hitting the mark with a friend's building about a mile away. I could get my pickle on the same day if I sent it her way. I had to wait for her to wake up, and then there was some back and forth to explain why I urgently needed this item. By then, the same-day slots for her house had disappeared.
Soon after, however, my dad called. My parents live in Chicago, but we share an Amazon Prime account, and he wanted to know why I was changing the addresses. (Monitoring his accounts is one of the many ways my retired father fills his days, I guess.) Curious, he asked to get in on the action. The mission to figure out same-day delivery was now a national one.
He purchased his support pickle around 9 a.m. Following the pickle's progress on the Amazon app on his phone, he saw it go out for delivery before 10. At 12:33, three and a half hours after he made his order, he texted me: The pickle had arrived.
When I ordered the pickle the next morning at 8, Amazon told me that it would arrive at my friend's house between 5 and 10 p.m. It traveled from a fulfillment center in Robbinsville, N.J., and it arrived within that window at 7:30, almost 12 hours later.
I texted my dad the update. "That area is a different beast," he responded.
He was correct. My parents live a short drive from one of Amazon's same-day facilities. I do not.
Pods and Cubbies Along the Happy Path
In New York City, there is one Amazon same-day center: a 218,000-square-foot warehouse in the Bronx that sits on the lot of a former multiplex cinema and has been operating for a year. The combined warehouse and delivery depot sends same-day orders to customers in the Bronx and nearby Queens, but not to Manhattan, Brooklyn or Staten Island.
Other fulfillment centers can accommodate same-day deliveries by adding a dedicated group that handles those orders -- which is how the pickle reached my friend's house -- but they are not set up in quite the same way. One way to move things faster is by limiting the options. Amazon's large fulfillment centers can store up to 40 million products, but same-day centers like the one in the Bronx keep on hand just the 100,000 top-selling items for that area.
"This is their version of a Walmart store," Mr. Wulfraat, the consultant, said.
On a recent Tuesday morning, Pratik Shah, a 28-year-old site manager, led me on a tour of the Bronx center. He showed me the "happy path" that my emotional support pickle would have taken had I lived in the right borough. It takes an average of five hours from the time a customer clicks the buy button to when the item arrives at the door, Mr. Shah said.
The available merchandise is determined by what millions of customers are searching for and purchasing frequently. In the Bronx, that includes "everyday essentials" like Gatorade, garbage bags, cat litter and adhesive hooks, as well as electronics like frequently misplaced iPhone chargers and air tags to find them the next time.
As Halloween approaches, more costumes are moved to same-day delivery. The same goes for toys as Christmas nears.
"It's not necessarily going to be what you want," said Matthew Hockenberry, a historian of supply chains at Fordham University. "It's what you are willing to accept."
When a customer places a same-day order and it is routed to the Bronx center, things start happening quickly. Smaller items that can be grabbed by hand are stored on tall yellow robots called "pods." These previously packed pods navigate to workers' stations. Think of those pods as shelves in a store. (Larger items are held in another part of the warehouse.)
While I watched, a screen directed Keri Simon, a fulfillment center associate, to grab particular items off the pod -- a bottle of shampoo or a 2025 New Yorker calendar -- and place them in a gray cubbyhole.
On the other side of the cubbyholes, Isabel Isais packed the items into one of three different sleeves: two sizes of brown paper and one plastic option. The computer in front showed which packaging to choose. Using these sleeves is faster than loading up boxes. Then a machine spit out a shipping label, which Ms. Isais put on the package.
All of this took seconds.
From there, my emotional support pickle would have been placed on a conveyor belt that carried it around the plant until it reached a machine that stamped a yellow sticker indicating its delivery route on the wrapped package. Amazon uses what it calls "routing technology" to account for the type of delivery locations, the size and weight of the package, walking distance and getting in and out of the vehicle.
On its final leg in the warehouse, the package falls down a designated chute where workers place packages in a cart. The carts, which hold up to 75 packages, are rolled to a pickup area. Delivery drivers then pull their assigned cart into the parking lot for one of the four daily deliveries: "breakfast," "brunch," "lunch" or "dinner" -- the meal you may be eating when your package arrives.
Making Nice With the Doorman
One of the biggest issues in delivery is the "last-mile" problem -- getting an object from a warehouse to your doorstep. This step adds costs, and the logistics can be hairy. And in cities like New York, a profusion of delivery vehicles block narrow streets and create traffic jams.
In the parking lot of Amazon's center in the Bronx, there are no Amazon delivery trucks, just a lot of Nissans and Toyotas. The delivery drivers wear blue Amazon vests, but they drive their own cars, loading up their trunks and back seats with goods.
Amazon classifies drivers who handle Amazon's same-day deliveries -- called Amazon Flex -- as independent contractors. But the drivers sued Amazon in 2016, saying they were being misclassified; that proposed class action is still being litigated.
For the time being, Amazon limits its same-day orders in New York City because of traffic and other issues, said Brian Perez, who leads Amazon's same-day operations in several Northeastern states. Delivering in the city creates special headaches, particularly in Manhattan, where drivers and e-bike delivery people can be foiled by incorrect passcodes or mislabeled apartment numbers.
Mr. Perez said he had a team that worked "with the lobby management" to build Amazon lockers or "cater our delivery times around each of the apartment building constraints."
They make friendly with the doorman, essentially.
Before I left the Bronx same-day center, I wanted to know if there had ever been an item that made Mr. Perez scratch his head and wonder, "Does that person really needed that today?"
After some coaxing, he offered an answer.
"I mean, a PlayStation controller comes to mind," Mr. Perez said. "Did you really need that same day?"
But, in truth, he didn't judge. Some people are avid gamers. Some need their Gatorade electrolyte boost. Some have a yen for an emotional support pickle.
"To each his own, right?" he said. It was his job, along with the robots, the pickers, the packers, the scanners and the drivers, to get them there.

C.E.O. Quits At Stellantis After Slump: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company, facing slumping sales, announced that Carlos Tavares would step down immediately and that a search for a new chief was underway.
The chief executive of the automaker Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, has resigned, the company said on Sunday, amid a decline in profits and slumping sales in its key North America region.
Mr. Tavares, 66, spearheaded the creation of the company in a 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and France's Peugeot. The company is one of the largest automakers in the world and produces vehicles under an array of brand names, including Chrysler, Jeep, Ram, Dodge, Fiat, Peugeot, Opel and Maserati.
"Stellantis's success since its creation has been rooted in a perfect alignment between the reference shareholders, the board and the C.E.O.," the company's senior independent director, Henri de Castries, said in a statement. "However, in recent weeks different views have emerged which have resulted in the board and the C.E.O. coming to today's decision."
Mr. Tavares could not immediately be reached for comment.
The resignation took effect on Sunday, the company said in the statement. Mr. Tavares had announced this year that he planned to retire at the end of his current contract, in 2026. The company also said a search for a successor by a special board committee was "well underway." It added that a new executive committee, headed by John Elkann, the chairman of the Stellantis board, would run the company until a permanent replacement for Mr. Tavares was named.
Mr. Elkann is a grandson of Gianni Agnelli, the Italian industrialist who founded Fiat. Mr. Elkann worked closely with Sergio Marchionne, who engineered Fiat's 2009 takeover of Chrysler, which was going through a bankruptcy.
Fiat Chrysler became profitable and grew under Mr. Marchionne, who died unexpectedly in 2018.
By 2020, though, both Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot were struggling to keep pace with other automakers that were investing tens of billions of dollars to develop and produce electric vehicles, and a merger between the two companies was forged. The combined company renamed itself Stellantis in 2021.
Under Mr. Tavares, Stellantis flourished for a time after the trans-Atlantic merger, and reported a record profit of 18.6 billion euros, about $ 19.7 billion, in 2023. He also outlined plans to develop E.V.s, although Stellantis was moving at a slower pace than its Detroit rivals, General Motors and Ford Motor. Bonuses stemming from the 2023 results helped make Mr. Tavares one of the highest-paid executives in the auto industry.
But the company's profits have fallen this year, as sales in the United States have dropped significantly. It was slow to match rivals' price reductions and sales incentives, and dealer inventories rose. In response, Stellantis has laid off workers, cut production and left idle a plant in Illinois that it had planned to restart.
In the first nine months of the year, Stellantis's U.S. sales fell 17 percent. In September, a group of dealers sent Mr. Tavares an open letter, blaming him for decisions aimed at driving up profits in 2023 that they said left the company in a troubled state.
"The intent of this letter is to sound an alarm -- an alarm, not only to you, but to the Stellantis board of directors, your employees, your investors and your suppliers," the letter said. "The reckless short-term decision making to secure record profits in 2023 has had devastating, yet entirely predictable, consequences in the U.S. market."
Soon after, Stellantis issued a profit warning, saying the cost of fixing its U.S. operations would dent its bottom line. Specifically, the company said operating profit would, at best, amount to 7 percent of sales compared with an earlier forecast of more than 10 percent.
The company's stock price has dropped more than 50 percent this year, from a high of more than $ 29 in March to $ 13.20, its close on Friday. On Monday, the stock fell another 8 percent.
The transition to electric vehicles has presented challenges for many automakers. While G.M., Toyota and Tesla continue to post substantial profits, Ford and Volkswagen have struggled to make money on E.V.s. The E.V. start-up Rivian has had trouble ramping up sales beyond about 50,000 vehicles a year.
Volkswagen recently said it could close as many as three plants, including factories in Germany, a once-unthinkable step for the company.
Mr. Tavares was born and educated in Portugal, and joined Renault in his early 20s. He rose through the ranks and became a close lieutenant of Carlos Ghosn, who was the chief executive of both Renault and Nissan. Mr. Tavares worked at the Japanese automaker Nissan for several years while it was controlled by Renault. He left Renault amid a falling out with Mr. Ghosn in 2013, and was hired as Peugeot's chief executive a year later.
Last month, Mr. Tavares announced a new design for large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, including electric models, and said Stellantis was on track to slash carbon emissions from its vehicles and factories by 2038. "This is our commitment to no-compromise innovation as we deliver clean, safe and affordable mobility to all," he said.

E.V. Chargers Finally Pay Off for Retailers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Companies see charging as a potentially profitable business in and of itself, not just as a spur for foot traffic and sales.
Sarajane Leary knows what to do when her electric car is low on power: She goes grocery shopping.
On a recent afternoon, Ms. Leary plugged her Toyota bZ4X into a fast electric vehicle charger in the parking lot of a Hannaford supermarket in Altamont, N.Y., and then headed into the store for paper goods and potato chips.
"I'll get a 50 percent charge while I'm here," she said.
The time -- and money -- Ms. Leary spends in a store while charging her car is exactly the kind of thing retailers, shopping centers and malls bet on when they started installing E.V. chargers decades ago. For years, their experience was mixed, and the actual benefits were unclear.
Now, new studies say retailers' charging efforts may well be paying off: One peer-reviewed study by researchers at Boston University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison published this year looked at the impact of nearly 1,600 Tesla Supercharger stations in more than 800 U.S. counties and found a 4 percent increase in monthly visits for retailers within 200 meters of chargers after they were installed. The effects were most pronounced for retailers within 150 meters. The researchers also found a 5 percent increase in spending.
Another recent study, published in Nature Communications, analyzed data from California, where E.V. ownership and charging infrastructure are more widespread than in other states. It found that installing chargers brought more modest increases in foot traffic and spending but that public E.V. stations "tend to attract higher-income, exploratory visitors and local residents," and in low-income areas they "enhance businesses."
Some companies -- notably Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States -- are seeing charging as a potentially profitable business in and of itself, not just as a spur for foot traffic and sales. They have begun building charging stations under their own brand names rather than relying on providers that lease a part of their parking lots to install and maintain the stations.
"Companies are beginning to see charging as something that can potentially help the bottom line," said Graham Evans, a director at S&P Global Mobility, an automotive market research firm. "It's going to become more ubiquitous rather than a token gesture."
The embrace of charging comes as more Americans -- many of whom are worried about a warming planet -- trade in their gas-powered cars. In 2023, 1.4 million plug-in electric vehicles were sold in the United States, more than 9 percent of all car sales that year and an increase of over 50 percent from 2022, according to Argonne National Laboratory, a federally funded research center. And although the growth of E.V. sales has slowed this year, an estimated 346,309 of the vehicles were sold in the third quarter, nearly 9 percent of sales, according to Cox Automotive, a market research firm. (It is too soon to say what impact Donald J. Trump's election will have on sales, but during his campaign he vowed that if he became president he would end the Biden administration's policies that encourage E.V. manufacturing and sales.)
Some of the slowdown in E.V. sales this year can be chalked up to drivers who hesitate to trade in their gas-powered cars because of concerns about E.V. charging infrastructure, which has grown more slowly than E.V. sales. Broken chargers have been a problem: One in five ports does not work when motorists pull up, according to recent research led by a Harvard Business School fellow.
In total, over 200,000 public chargers are spread across about 74,000 stations, but more than a million public chargers will be needed by 2030 to keep up with E.V. sales, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have estimated.
Even with the Biden administration's $ 5 billion plan to fill in the infrastructure gap, a robust national network is still years away. Under that plan, states are required to submit proposals for charging operators and site hosts. Nearly 60 percent of the grants have gone to fuel and convenience stores, rest stops and service plazas, according to EVAdoption, a data and analytics firm. Still, only one in every 14 big-box locations offers charging, while one in every 15 grocery stores and one in every 40 department stores do, a Consumer Reports analysis found.
For many retailers, charging deficiencies present an opportunity: Truckers, ride-hailing drivers and people on long-distance trips rely on public chargers, as do the 5 percent of E.V. owners who are not able to charge at home, many of whom live in apartment buildings and park on the street. The most frequently used public chargers are at retailers, according to a 2024 study of usage data by J.D. Power, a data analytics company.
Some landlords of shopping centers and malls have found that installing chargers on their properties has helped to attract new tenants, said Jim Hurless, a managing director who oversees the E.V. business at the real estate firm CBRE.
But installing the chargers is complicated and expensive. The process involves surveying, engineering, permitting, connecting with local utilities, testing and inspection -- and can take up to 18 months from start to finish. Slower chargers -- considered a good fit for cinemas and hotels, where a customer parks for a few hours or overnight -- can cost up to $ 7,000 to install. Fast chargers, which can provide a significant charge in 20 minutes, can cost as much as $ 175,000.
Many retailers turn the project over to a charging company that pays them a monthly fee for the parking spaces used while retaining any revenue from customers. And those providers have been installing more, and faster, chargers and promising a more reliable, and in some cases plusher, customer experience than in the past.
Mercedes-Benz is investing $ 1 billion on the first phase of a new network of high-speed chargers that can accommodate all brands of vehicles. Its charging stations will have lounges -- and landscaping -- at some locations. The automaker has installed charging hubs at a dozen Buc-ee's gas and convenience stores in the Southeast, with plans to expand to more than 40 additional sites. Starbucks, which had Volvo install 15 stations on properties between Seattle and Denver, will work with Mercedes to add 100 more, including on Interstate 5 on the West Coast.
Some charging companies are developing methods to speed up installations. EVgo has begun to experiment with a prefabricated model, with its first installation at a site in League City, Texas, in March.
But some retailers, like the convenience-store chains 7-Eleven and RaceTrac, are seeking to take control over -- and monetize -- charging by building their own networks.
For several years, Walmart has worked with Electrify America, a division of Volkswagen, and now has Electrify America stations at 280 of the retailer's stores. When Walmart tested its own chargers at stores near its Bentonville, Ark., headquarters and in a town near Dallas, it found demand surprisingly strong, said Vishal Kapadia, the company's senior vice president for energy transformation.
"There is a need for this infrastructure in many pockets," he said.
The company is rolling out 15 stations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and 10 in Phoenix, and it plans to have thousands across the country by 2030. Walmart expects to spend $ 1 million to $ 1.5 million at each site.
"Charging can be a profitable stand-alone business," Mr. Kapadia said. "The ancillary benefits are driving traffic to our locations."
Even Costco, one of the first retailers to install charging stations in the 1990s, before ripping them out in 2011 because the company said they were rarely used, has recently returned to E.V. charging. Costco installed a station at its store in Ridgefield, Wash., in just seven weeks.
Hannaford, a Northeast grocer with charging stations at 24 of 189 stores -- including the one Ms. Leary frequents -- got into the charging business because it was "how we want to present ourselves," said George Parmenter, health and sustainability lead at Hannaford. "It's a billboard that says, 'This is something important to us."'
Mr. Parmenter said he did not know to what extent charging led to in-store sales, but he noted that a Tesla charging station at a Hannaford store in Portland, Maine, averaged about 2,000 charging sessions a month.
"I don't know what else you could do to get that many people to show up," he added.
Brent Gruber, executive director of E.V. practice at J.D. Power, said: "Fifteen years ago it may have not made the most sense to add charging. Now it makes sense."

Trump Tariffs Would Be 'Two-Alarm Fire' for Automakers and Parts Suppliers: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Automakers and parts suppliers would struggle if President-elect Donald J. Trump followed through on his threat to impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.
President-elect Donald J. Trump's threat to impose 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada sent shivers on Tuesday through the auto industry, which depends heavily on both countries for parts and manufacturing.
The prospect of tariffs "is a two-alarm fire for the auto industry," said Patrick Anderson, chief executive of Anderson Economic Group, a consulting firm in Michigan. "There is probably not a single assembly plant in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Texas that would not immediately be affected by a 25 percent tariff."
The list of popular vehicles made in Mexico or Canada is long. It includes Ram pickups made by Stellantis in Saltillo, Mexico, and Chrysler minivans built in Windsor, Ontario. General Motors makes Chevrolet Silverado pickups and electric versions of Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s in Mexico, where Ford Motor also makes its Maverick pickup.
All of those vehicles and many others would become significantly more expensive if Mr. Trump, who won Michigan with promises to preserve auto jobs, followed through on his threat, economists said. Those higher auto prices would have a significant effect on overall inflation. And higher car prices would probably lead to lower sales and layoffs at auto factories.
"In his first term, President Trump instituted tariffs against China that created jobs, spurred investment and resulted in no inflation," Karoline Leavitt, spokeswoman for the Trump-Vance Transition, said in an email. Once in office, she said, he will work to bring jobs back to the United States by "raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations and unshackling American energy."
The prospect of disruptive tariffs hits the industry at a perilous moment. Virtually all automakers are struggling with sagging consumer demand, a growing preference for hybrids and electric cars, and the emergence of Chinese automakers like BYD that are pushing into markets once dominated by Japanese, American and European companies.
Signs of industry woes are proliferating. Nissan, which manufactures several vehicles in Aguascalientes, Mexico, as well as Mississippi and Tennessee, said this month that it would lay off 9,000 employees worldwide because of declining sales. Volkswagen, which has factories in Mexico and Tennessee, is considering closing plants in Europe for the first time in its history.
Sales at Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat and other brands, fell 27 percent in the third quarter compared with a year earlier. Even luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz, which make cars in Mexico and the United States, are earning smaller profits.
Mr. Trump's policy pronouncements have already jolted the industry. The president-elect has vowed to eliminate Biden-era subsidies for electric vehicles, endangering tens of billion of dollars that General Motors and other automakers have invested in U.S. battery factories and new car models.
"The auto industry is in a process of a transformation that is the biggest tech upgrade in history," said Dimitry Anastakis, a professor at the University of Toronto who studies business history. "They are looking for as much stability as possible as they navigate this disruptive landscape. To throw a spanner in the works is not helpful."
Mexican and Canadian factories buy auto parts from the United States and the two countries are major suppliers of components to virtually all U.S. manufacturers including Tesla. That company's chief executive, Elon Musk, was a big supporter of Mr. Trump's campaign and is expected to play a significant role in his administration.
Automakers got a taste of how closely linked they are to Canada in 2022, when groups of truck drivers in that country blocked a bridge linking Windsor to Detroit in protest of pandemic restrictions. Toyota, Ford, Stellantis and others were forced to shut down U.S. assembly lines because of parts shortages even though the protest lasted less than a week.
"Southern Ontario is closer to Detroit auto plants than the supply plants in Indiana, Ohio and Kansas are," said Erik Gordon, a professor of business at the University of Michigan, who follows the auto industry. Tariffs, he said, "would have an effect similar to New York City imposing a tax on food and fuel that comes into the city from New Jersey."
Mr. Trump said tariffs would remain in place until Mexico stopped the flow of illicit drugs and unauthorized immigrants to the United States. But tariffs could lead to an increase in migration if some of the one million Mexicans who work in the auto industry lost their jobs, analysts say.
"As the economy goes, there goes prosperity," said Anna Nagurney, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies supply chains. "It can have spillover effects."
Tariffs could push Mexico closer to China. BYD, SAIC, Geely and other Chinese carmakers have been moving into Mexico, plastering billboards with images of their cars and opening dealerships at a fast clip. BYD and others have been scouting locations in Monterrey and other cities as sites for manufacturing plants.
But plans for factories are on hold while the Chinese wait to see what Mr. Trump will do, Mexican officials have said.
Wall Street was clearly alarmed by the prospect of tariffs. G.M.'s stock closed 9 percent lower on Tuesday after Mr. Trump's statement on tariffs. Stellantis fell about 6 percent, and Ford was down nearly 3 percent.
Ford said its shares suffered less because its operations were more concentrated in the United States than other automakers. "Ford is the most committed to building in America among the major automakers," the company said in a statement.
Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Nissan and Volkswagen declined to answer questions about tariffs, as did the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the industry's main trade group.
BMW, which has large factories in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, and Spartanburg, S.C., declined to comment on Mr. Trump's tariff threat, but said in a statement that free markets are "a key factor not only for our business model, but also for growth, welfare and employment throughout the global economy."
Some auto experts expressed hope that the threat of tariffs was merely a bargaining tool and would never be imposed. The strategy could be effective, some experts conceded.
"People in China and Canada are thinking about concessions they could make before there is even anything on the table," said Richard Baldwin, a professor of economics at the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland. "He's forcing the Canadians and Mexicans to prenegotiate with themselves."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lt. Gen. Christopher T. Donahue was recently selected to lead the U.S. Army's Europe Command as the war in Ukraine heads into its fourth year.
A Republican senator is blocking the promotion of Lt. Gen. Christopher T. Donahue, the commander of U.S. troops in the final days of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, in what could be the first salvo in a Trump administration war against America's generals.
Senator Markwayne Mullin, Republican of Oklahoma, put a hold on General Donahue's promotion to four stars, or general, after his nomination was sent to the Armed Services Committee last week, officials said.
Sabrina Singh, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon, told reporters on Monday that the Defense Department was "aware" of the hold.
General Donahue was the last American service member to depart Afghanistan as Taliban fighters took control on Aug. 31, 2021. A decorated former Delta Force commander, Army Ranger and paratrooper with multiple tours in Afghanistan and Iraq, he was recently selected to lead the U.S. Army's Europe Command as the war in Ukraine heads into its fourth year.
General Donahue has long been seen as a likely candidate to eventually become the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military's most senior position.
Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News host whom President-elect Donald J. Trump has selected as his defense secretary, has indicated that he wants to fire Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., an Air Force fighter pilot who is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Trump transition officials have said they plan to go after generals in the Pentagon for a list of perceived crimes, including taking part in the Afghanistan evacuation and promoting diversity in the ranks.
And NBC News reported that the Trump transition team is exploring whether generals who were involved in the Afghanistan evacuation can be court-martialed, although it is unclear how they could be held culpable for following lawful orders from the commander in chief.
But if that purge includes General Donahue, 55, who is known throughout the military as "C.D." and who led the Army's successful rush to speed aid to Ukraine in the early days of the Russian invasion, then the American military may soon see a wholesale change in leadership.
"I fought alongside C.D. in some of the most dangerous fighting along the Syrian border and can personally vouch for his individual bravery and leadership," said Doug Philippone, who spent 18 years in the Army and was deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan and is a co-founder of the venture capital firm Snowpoint Ventures.
General Donahue, Mr. Philippone said, "is one of the few generals that are pushing full steam against the bureaucracy to innovate and modernize our military."
A spokesperson for Mr. Mullin's office declined to comment.
The Oklahoma senator has been a vocal critic of the Afghanistan evacuation, a process that began during the first administration of Mr. Trump, who signed an agreement with the Taliban in February 2020 stipulating that American troops would leave Afghanistan by May 1, 2021.
But Mr. Mullin has reserved his criticism for the Biden administration, which carried out the Afghan withdrawal. In 2021, as a GOP congressman, Mr. Mullin posted a photo of himself on Instagram saying he was headed home from "helping get Americans out of Afghanistan."
He wrote then: "President Biden and his administration are absolutely lying to the American people about Americans and our friends being left behind."
For his part, General Donahue arrived at Kabul international airport on Aug. 18, three days after the Afghan capital fell to the Taliban. In front of him was an impossible puzzle: a sprawling airport besieged by desperate people trying to flee and not enough troops to carry out an orderly end to America's longest war.
Days later, on Aug. 26, 2021, a suicide bombing at the airport's Abbey Gate killed 13 U.S. service members and scores of Afghan civilians. General Donahue was not responsible for that part of the airport when the attack occurred.
His soldiers from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division held the airport for the final 48 hours of the U.S. mission and managed to evacuate Afghan and American citizens despite limited resources.
General Donahue was the commander on the ground on Aug. 29 when an American MQ-9 Reaper drone shot a Hellfire missile at a white Toyota Corolla in a neighborhood near the airport. The Pentagon at the time said the car was filled with bombs but later acknowledged that 10 civilians had been killed and that the car was carrying water bottles and posed no threat.
General Donahue's supporters say he was dealt an impossible hand in Afghanistan at a time when civilian leaders had put the American military in an impossible position.
Withholding General Donahue's promotion is both a "disservice" to him and "a slap in the face to the soldiers that spend their career fighting the wars of the last 25 years," said Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East.
"Politicians and policymakers should be held responsible for their own decisions, not those honor bound to carrying them out," Mr. Mulroy said. "That hold on Chris Donahue's promotion should be removed immediately."
A company commander who was at the airport during the evacuation said it was "nuts" that General Donahue's promotion was being delayed and that the troops who were on the ground that day should not be punished for what happened.
Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., who was head of U.S. Central Command during the American evacuation of Afghanistan, called General Donahue "one of the finest officers the U.S. Army has ever produced."
General Donahue is the "commander you want in a tough situation," General McKenzie said. "In short, he's the best we've got."

First Table Tennis, And Then a Shift To Shell Games: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: When Kimberlie Reed met Michael Hyatt on Tinder in 2017, she was in awe.
On their first date, after several months of exchanging messages, they sat at a high top table near the bar at a Sacramento BJ's. Mr. Hyatt, his head shaved and wearing a crisp button-down shirt, regaled her with stories of representing his native Jamaica in table tennis at the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games.
He was magnetic and accomplished and, to her mind, it made perfect sense that in the June 2014 issue of USA Table Tennis's monthly magazine he had been called "the Usain Bolt of Table Tennis."
Over the ensuing months, the two began a romantic relationship. Mr. Hyatt spoke to Ms. Reed at length about what he said was his passion project: PongNation, a table tennis club akin to SPIN, the Susan Sarandon-connected franchise started in New York in 2009. He walked Ms. Reed through an empty storefront in an industrial pocket of nearby Roseville that he said would soon be PongNation's home, describing franchise agreements he had reached with Puma and Starbucks. By co-signing business loans, opening credit cards and adding some of her own cash, she, too, became part of it.
"Next thing I know," Ms. Reed said, "he fled the country."
Dozens of interviews, court records, text messages, financial statements and other documents reviewed by The New York Times show that Ms. Reed was hardly the first person to believe in Mr. Hyatt and, soon after, regret it.
Efforts to reach Mr. Hyatt, 54, for comment were unsuccessful. Various cellphone and WhatsApp numbers associated with him in the United States and abroad have been disconnected. He did not reply to messages sent to three different email addresses and various social media profiles he has used over the years.
His brother, when reached via Facebook Messenger, replied: "Zelle me 2k and I'll tell you anything you want to know." (The New York Times does not pay people it interviews for news articles.) Mr. Hyatt's mother, when reached by phone in August, said that she hadn't spoken to him in "years" before remarking, "I don't know if he's dead or alive."
Then she hung up.
A Reputation Begins to Tarnish
Many of Mr. Hyatt's personal and business relationships were built on what people did not know about him.
Despite the impression he may have given, Mr. Hyatt's Olympic career was not illustrious. He finished 33rd in men's singles at the 1992 Games in Barcelona, and 49th at the 1996 Atlanta Games, along with a 25th-place finish in men's doubles.
But he remained a known, and liked, presence in the niche, close-knit table tennis community, where the vast majority of competitors work multiple jobs while pursuing their athletic dreams. In the 1990s, the circuit involved tournaments at recreation centers and church basements, and a hodgepodge of car-pooling and last-minute lodging. Some athletes described how Mr. Hyatt would be the first to lend a couch for crashing during tournaments or paddles or apparel.
Feelings shifted in February 1996, when Mr. Hyatt hosted a tournament in Georgia and failed to pay $ 15,000 in prize money, Christian Lillieroos, a coach who knew Mr. Hyatt, said.
"It came as a big surprise to me," Mr. Lillieroos said. "I couldn't believe he was doing it."
Mr. Hyatt ran into other trouble. He was not permitted to travel with the Jamaican national team in 1999 "due to poor disciplinary records," according to a report in the Jamaican publication The Gleaner, which noted that he had been sent home early from the Central American and Caribbean Games "because of misbehavior."
Mr. Hyatt kept busy in other ways. He started a company called EJAM IT Solutions in December 1998, according to a registration with the state of Georgia, where he had put down roots.
Four years later, at least five schools in Jamaica had ordered 150 computers from EJAM and made down payments of several thousand dollars. But, according to a report in The Gleaner, the computers never arrived, and Mr. Hyatt was nowhere to be found.
In 2003, Mr. Hyatt was charged in Cobb County, Ga., with a felony after being accused of floating a bad check. In December 2003, Mr. Hyatt also faced a charge of fraud, according to court records. That year, the bad check case was dismissed and he paid a restitution tied to the fraud case.
In 2005, Mr. Hyatt filed a change of address with the court. He was moving to California.
'He's an Empty Shell'
In Northern California, Mr. Hyatt met women online, told them of his Olympic past, then began to pitch them his idea for a ping pong facility. Some declined to invest, while others took out several thousand dollars in loans or co-signed loans with Mr. Hyatt, according to interviews with women, friends and colleagues who knew him at the time.
Sandra Blanco met Mr. Hyatt on a dating website in 2005. "I was very impressed with him," Ms. Blanco said. "I'm from Nicaragua, we had some cultural similarities and bonded really well."
Ms. Blanco said that she often saw Mr. Hyatt on the phone and on his laptop. "He always seemed like he was working two jobs," she said. He often paid for meals, movies, groceries and other shared expenses. "I didn't lose a dollar with Michael," she said of their early courtship.
After about a year, they moved in together. But six months after she gave birth to their daughter in 2007, and after two years together, Ms. Blanco and Mr. Hyatt separated.
Ms. Blanco was granted full custody of their daughter. Mr. Hyatt was ordered to pay monthly child support payments of $ 1,200, which he did until 2017. For reasons that are unclear to Ms. Blanco, the payments stopped and resumed only in fall 2023. The payments are made via direct deposit, and neither she nor her daughter have had any contact with Mr. Hyatt in more than a decade.
"Lots of things are missing from him," Ms. Blanco said. "He's an empty shell."
In 2015, Mr. Hyatt was barred permanently from USA Table Tennis because of "sexual misconduct," according to the U.S. Center for SafeSport, the nonprofit organization directed by Congress to handle accusations of misconduct in Olympic and Paralympic sports. (As a matter of policy, SafeSport does not disclose details of its cases.)
Yet Mr. Hyatt continued to be involved in the sport, competing for Jamaica in several tournaments, including the world championships in Malaysia in 2016. In an Instagram post, he celebrated Jamaica for winning a bronze medal. However, the team finished 75th.
On Dec. 30, 2016, he announced his retirement from the sport.
"Life changes," he said at the time. "And you have different motivations."
His relationship with Ms. Blanco over, Mr. Hyatt kept dating. Jodi Cummins was working two jobs and driving an Uber to make ends meet when Mr. Hyatt took her on a first date to an elegant dinner in Napa. A single mother living in Sacramento, Ms. Cummins was a "bit cautious" when they began seeing each other but was moved one weekend when Mr. Hyatt took her to Trader Joe's and picked up the bill and filled the gas tank of her car. "He was flashy but generous," she said.
Soon, Mr. Hyatt told her that he was looking at homes closer to her in Sacramento. "I was really excited," she said.
DeMylon Vinson, a real estate broker, gave Mr. Hyatt and Ms. Cummins a tour of a four-bedroom, two-bathroom, 1,873-square-foot home in Elk Grove, south of Sacramento. Ms. Cummins thought that she was looking at a home Mr. Hyatt alone would inhabit but, without her knowledge, Mr. Hyatt said in emails to Mr. Vinson that he and Ms. Cummins would be moving in together.
Despite those messages, Mr. Vinson said that Mr. Hyatt then "just disappeared."
One night around the same time, Mr. Hyatt, who was staying with Ms. Cummins because he said a home he was renting nearby wasn't ready to move into, didn't return home when she was expecting him. She learned that Mr. Hyatt had been arrested, apparently over a rental car he had not returned. In going through his paperwork, text messages and communications with others, she learned that Mr. Hyatt had been fired from his job and hadn't paid his rent. He was also receiving unemployment payments and an EBT card at her address and pursuing other women online.
A statement Ms. Cummins reviewed for a credit card that she said had been taken out in her name without her knowledge revealed that, on at least one occasion, he had gone to the movies instead of an office job during the day.
She tried to end things. She filed a restraining order, presenting a judge with evidence that included a text message from Mr. Hyatt threatening to kill her cat. She, her son and the cat moved in with a family member.
Ms. Cummins soon returned to her house and found Mr. Hyatt there. She called the police. "I stood on the front lawn and watched the sheriff carry him out," she said. "It was a nightmare."
Mr. Vinson, who was unaware of what had been transpiring, said he was surprised when several months later, Mr. Hyatt reached out to say he was looking for a house again, this time with his new partner, Elizabeth Toro, a blackjack dealer who also lived in the Sacramento area.
Ms. Toro and Mr. Hyatt had their first date in February 2018, and "he was over the top right away from the beginning," she said. He drove an Escalade and always wore nice suits, shirts and pants. When she looked him up after the first date, his Olympian past checked out and he seemed well-traveled.
Two weeks in, though, "he did weird things," Ms. Toro said. Once again, he moved aggressively, first trying to move in with her -- which she resisted, even as he showed up with a suitcase and a box of sports memorabilia -- and then quickly pitching a chance to invest in his business.
They met with Mr. Vinson and walked through a home. Afterward, Mr. Hyatt took Ms. Toro to a furniture store and asked if she would apply for a line of credit for him. That request was too much for Ms. Toro. "Then it all unravels," she said of their relationship.
Shortly after that, she said, she received a statement for a credit card he had apparently taken out in her name without her knowledge.
In Mr. Vinson's real estate office a few miles away, he received an application for the home with all of Ms. Toro's personal details. "We approved it based on her," he said.
Ms. Toro said she had no idea.
In April 2018, a check from Mr. Hyatt to Mr. Vinson for a lease option for the home bounced. He subsequently took Mr. Hyatt to small claims court.
"I learned the hard way," Mr. Vinson said. "Never take a personal check."
By then Mr. Hyatt had a new girlfriend, one who hadn't seen the court dockets: Kimberlie Reed.
'Your Boyfriend Will Be a Millionaire'
In the summer of 2018, Mr. Hyatt told Ms. Reed that he was eagerly anticipating a $ 108,000 federal loan that would help launch PongNation. Soon, he said, he could focus on his table tennis endeavor full time.
"We'll do well over the $ 1.4 million in revenue I'm projecting for Aug to Dec 2018 and make over $ 700K in profit as well," Mr. Hyatt texted her.
Mr. Hyatt wanted to stage a tournament in July 2018 at a local venue, and in the weeks leading up to the event, she said he told her that "1,000 people" were signed up.
Mr. Hyatt asked her to help get the tournament going, she said. Mr. Hyatt said that he had an investor who wanted to pay $ 1.2 million for a 10 percent stake in the company. But the investor, he said, needed to see that Mr. Hyatt had $ 100,000 in cash -- and that the tournament was successful.
Mr. Hyatt and Ms. Reed then went to a bank to open a business line of credit in both of their names. They did the same at another bank.
Mr. Hyatt and Ms. Reed visited a CarMax, where she said she signed for a loan for a $ 29,000 Toyota Highlander. Mr. Hyatt handed over a check for $ 2,000 and said the car would be used for business purposes, Ms. Reed said. (The check bounced.)
On Aug. 4, 2018, Ms. Reed arrived at the venue for the tournament and found only a handful of athletes in attendance.
"It was a joke," she said. Mr. Hyatt returned to her home that night despondent and went to bed.
The next morning, "it was like it hadn't happened," Ms. Reed said. He posted on Facebook that the tournament was a success.
Ms. Reed began receiving statements for other credit cards opened using her personal information that she had not signed up for, including a Capital One card that was maxed out for over $ 10,000. An American Express gold card in Ms. Reed's name had more than $ 20,000 worth of charges on it.
When Ms. Reed confronted Mr. Hyatt, he continued to reassure her that investor funds were coming soon. "I think we'll get $ 100K tomorrow afternoon and $ 400K next Thursday or Friday," he messaged Ms. Reed on Aug. 6.
On Aug. 15, Mr. Hyatt texted Ms. Reed, "I have a check for $ 100K and a signed agreement in place." But he dodged her efforts to meet in person. In their back and forth that week, he said "your boyfriend will be a millionaire by years end. PongNation will do about $ 16M in 2019 and make over $ 4M in profit. Love your man, support him, let him come to you."
Despite the bravado, Mr. Hyatt's world began to cave in on him. On Aug. 30, Ms. Reed went to the hotel where Mr. Hyatt was staying and reclaimed the Highlander that she had purchased for him.
Ms. Reed also hired a private investigator to look into the man she thought she was building a life with. Two weeks later, a bench warrant for Mr. Hyatt's arrest was issued for the alleged misuse of welfare funds, as reported by Ms. Cummins.
'I'm Going to Be OK'
Mr. Hyatt soon surfaced in Guam, a U.S. territory, drawn by a job offer from its table tennis federation.
"I now have a Guam driver's license," he told The Guam Post on Oct. 19, 2018, in an article headlined "Guam Table Tennis Gets an Olympian." He said he had arrived to coach and "I am here to stay."
Within a few hours of the article being published online, the email inbox of the reporter who wrote it, Matt Weiss, filled with messages from Ms. Reed and others who told of their experiences with Mr. Hyatt. Mr. Weiss wrote another article, this one with the headline "Former Olympian on Guam Wanted in California." The table tennis federation pulled Mr. Hyatt's job offer.
He left Guam for Southeast Asia.
He turned up in the Philippines, and assumed a new identity as Anthony Bennett, according to interviews with people there and a copy of the identification he used, which was seen by The New York Times.
Mr. Hyatt continued to meet with women. Several who interacted with him during this time remember him constantly being on his laptop or his phone, moving from one hotel to another, and asking for money. He spoke less of his table tennis past. On a LinkedIn profile, Mr. Hyatt claimed he worked as a vice president of sales and marketing for the food company ADM from February 2018 to May 2021. A company spokeswoman said they did not find "anyone of that name in our records."
Back in Sacramento, Ms. Reed is continuing to improve her credit. She is also in counseling.
"I was so humiliated after this," she said.
She communicates with others like Ms. Cummins who say they were also duped by Mr. Hyatt and occasionally grabs a glass of wine with them. They've compared their timelines, and credit card statements.
All told, Mr. Hyatt now stands accused of defrauding at least 10 people out of a total of several hundred thousand dollars.
"This guy is so good at what he does," Ms. Cummins said. "It makes you feel like you're kind of crazy but then you meet these women and you think, 'I'm going to be OK."'
Ms. Reed has refrained from dating since her time with Mr. Hyatt. She teaches second grade during the day and teaches Pilates in her spare time. And she continues to share her story about her Tinder date with an Olympian that ran amok.
On a recent spring afternoon, she clicked through files on her laptop, her dog, Stella, looking on as the sun set against the shining tiles of the mosaics that adorn the walls of her dining room.
"I have ZERO regrets," one of the last text messages she received from Mr. Hyatt said. "When my time comes to move on from this world to the next I will be proud that I took the road less travelled."

Feelings shifted in February 1996, when Hyatt hosted a tournament in Georgia and failed to pay $15,000 in prize money, said Christian Lillieroos, a coach who knew Hyatt.
“It came as a big surprise to me,” Lillieroos said. “I couldn’t believe he was doing it.”
Hyatt ran into other trouble. He was not permitted to travel with the Jamaican national team in 1999 “due to poor disciplinary records,” according to a report in the Jamaican publication The Gleaner , which noted that he had been sent home early from the Central American and Caribbean Games “because of misbehavior.”
Hyatt kept busy in other ways. He started a company called EJAM IT Solutions in December 1998, according to a registration with the state of Georgia, where he had put down roots.
Four years later, at least five schools in Jamaica had ordered 150 computers from EJAM and made down payments of several thousand dollars. But, according to a report in The Gleaner, the computers never arrived, and Hyatt was nowhere to be found.
In 2003, Hyatt was charged in Cobb County, Georgia, with a felony after being accused of floating a bad check. In December 2003, Hyatt also faced a charge of fraud, according to court records. That year, the bad-check case was dismissed, and he paid a restitution tied to the fraud case.
In 2005, Hyatt filed a change of address with the court. He was moving to California.
‘He’s an Empty Shell’
In Northern California, Hyatt met women online, told them of his Olympic past, then began to pitch them his idea for a pingpong facility. Some declined to invest, while others took out several thousand dollars in loans or co-signed loans with Hyatt, according to interviews with women, friends and colleagues who knew him at the time.
Sandra Blanco met Hyatt on a dating website in 2005. “I was very impressed with him,” Blanco said. “I’m from Nicaragua. We had some cultural similarities and bonded really well.”
Blanco said she often saw Hyatt on the phone and on his laptop. “He always seemed like he was working two jobs,” she said. He often paid for meals, movies, groceries and other shared expenses. “I didn’t lose a dollar with Michael,” she said of their early courtship.
After about a year, they moved in together. But six months after she gave birth to their daughter in 2007, and after two years together, Blanco and Hyatt separated.
Blanco was granted full custody of their daughter. Hyatt was ordered to pay monthly child support payments of $1,200, which he did until 2017. For reasons that are unclear to Blanco, the payments stopped and resumed only last fall. The payments are made via direct deposit, and neither she nor her daughter has had any contact with Hyatt in more than a decade.
“Lots of things are missing from him,” Blanco said. “He’s an empty shell.”
In 2015, Hyatt was barred permanently from USA Table Tennis because of “sexual misconduct,” according to the U.S. Center for SafeSport, a nonprofit organization directed by Congress to handle accusations of misconduct in Olympic and Paralympic sports. (As a matter of policy, SafeSport does not disclose details of its cases.)
Yet, Hyatt continued to be involved in the sport, competing for Jamaica in several tournaments, including the world championships in Malaysia in 2016. In an Instagram post, he celebrated Jamaica for winning a bronze medal. However, the team finished 75th.
On Dec. 30, 2016, he announced his retirement from the sport.
“Life changes,” he said at the time. “And you have different motivations.”
His relationship with Blanco over, Hyatt kept dating. Jodi Cummins was working two jobs and driving an Uber to make ends meet when Hyatt took her on a first date to an elegant dinner in Napa, California. A single mother living in Sacramento, Cummins was a “bit cautious” when they began seeing each other but was moved one weekend when Hyatt took her to Trader Joe’s and picked up the bill and filled the gas tank of her car. “He was flashy but generous,” she said.
Soon, Hyatt told her that he was looking at homes closer to her in Sacramento. “I was really excited,” she said.
DeMylon Vinson, a real estate broker, gave Hyatt and Cummins a tour of a four-bedroom, two-bathroom, 1,873-square-foot home in Elk Grove, south of Sacramento. Cummins thought that she was looking at a home Hyatt alone would inhabit but, without her knowledge, Hyatt said in emails to Vinson that he and Cummins would be moving in together.
Despite those messages, Vinson said Hyatt then “just disappeared.”
One night around the same time, Hyatt, who was staying with Cummins because he said a home he was renting nearby wasn’t ready to move into, didn’t return home when she was expecting him. She learned that Hyatt had been arrested, apparently over a rental car he had not returned. In going through his paperwork, text messages and communications with others, she learned that Hyatt had been fired from his job and hadn’t paid his rent. He was also receiving unemployment payments and an EBT — short for electronic benefits transfer — card at her address and pursuing other women online.
A statement Cummins reviewed for a credit card that she said had been taken out in her name without her knowledge revealed that, on at least one occasion, he had gone to the movies instead of an office job during the day.
She tried to end things. She filed a restraining order, presenting a judge with evidence that included a text message from Hyatt threatening to kill her cat. She, her son and the cat moved in with a family member.
Cummins soon returned to her house and found Hyatt there. She called police. “I stood on the front lawn and watched the sheriff carry him out,” she said. “It was a nightmare.”
Vinson, who was unaware of what had been transpiring, said he was surprised when, several months later, Hyatt reached out to say he was looking for a house again, this time with his new partner, Elizabeth Toro, a blackjack dealer who also lived in the Sacramento area.
Toro and Hyatt had their first date in February 2018, and “he was over the top right away from the beginning,” she said. He drove an Escalade and always wore nice suits, shirts and pants. When she looked him up after the first date, his Olympian past checked out, and he seemed well-traveled.
Two weeks in, though, “he did weird things,” Toro said. Once again, he moved aggressively, first trying to move in with her — which she resisted, even as he showed up with a suitcase and a box of sports memorabilia — and then quickly pitching a chance to invest in his business.
They met with Vinson and walked through a home. Afterward, Hyatt took Toro to a furniture store and asked if she would apply for a line of credit for him. That request was too much for Toro. “Then it all unravels,” she said of their relationship.
Shortly after that, she said, she received a statement for a credit card he had apparently taken out in her name without her knowledge.
In Vinson’s real estate office a few miles away, he received an application for the home with all of Toro’s personal details. “We approved it based on her,” he said.
Toro said she had no idea.
In April 2018, a check from Hyatt to Vinson for a lease option for the home bounced. He subsequently took Hyatt to small-claims court.
“I learned the hard way,” Vinson said. “Never take a personal check.”
By then, Hyatt had a new girlfriend, one who hadn’t seen the court dockets: Kimberlie Reed.
‘Your Boyfriend Will Be a Millionaire’
In the summer of 2018, Hyatt told Reed that he was eagerly anticipating a $108,000 federal loan that would help launch PongNation. Soon, he said, he could focus on his table tennis endeavor full time.
“We’ll do well over the $1.4 million in revenue I’m projecting for Aug to Dec 2018 and make over $700K in profit as well,” Hyatt texted her.
Hyatt wanted to stage a tournament in July 2018 at a local venue, and in the weeks leading up to the event, she said he told her that “1,000 people” were signed up.
Hyatt asked her to help get the tournament going, she said. Hyatt said he had an investor who wanted to pay $1.2 million for a 10% stake in the company. But the investor, he said, needed to see that Hyatt had $100,000 in cash — and that the tournament was successful.
Hyatt and Reed then went to a bank to open a business line of credit in both of their names. They did the same at another bank.
Hyatt and Reed visited a CarMax, where she said she signed for a loan for a $29,000 Toyota Highlander. Hyatt handed over a check for $2,000 and said the car would be used for business purposes, Reed said. (The check bounced.)
On Aug. 4, 2018, Reed arrived at the venue for the tournament and found only a handful of athletes in attendance.
“It was a joke,” she said. Hyatt returned to her home that night despondent and went to bed.
The next morning, “it was like it hadn’t happened,” Reed said. He posted on Facebook that the tournament was a success.
Reed began receiving statements for other credit cards opened using her personal information that she had not signed up for, including a Capital One card that was maxed out for more than $10,000. An American Express gold card in Reed’s name had more than $20,000 worth of charges on it.
When Reed confronted Hyatt, he continued to reassure her that investor funds were coming soon. “I think we’ll get $100K tomorrow afternoon and $400K next Thursday or Friday,” he messaged Reed on Aug. 6.
On Aug. 15, Hyatt texted Reed, “I have a check for $100K and a signed agreement in place.” But he dodged her efforts to meet in person. In their back-and-forth that week, he said that “your boyfriend will be a millionaire by years end. PongNation will do about $16M in 2019 and make over $4M in profit. Love your man, support him, let him come to you.”
Despite the bravado, Hyatt’s world began to cave in on him. On Aug. 30, Reed went to the hotel where Hyatt was staying and reclaimed the Highlander that she had purchased for him.
Reed also hired a private investigator to look into the man she thought she was building a life with. Two weeks later, a bench warrant for Hyatt’s arrest was issued for the alleged misuse of welfare funds, as reported by Cummins.
‘I’m Going to Be OK’
Hyatt soon surfaced in Guam, a U.S. territory, drawn by a job offer from its table tennis federation.
“I now have a Guam driver’s license,” he told The Guam Post on Oct. 19, 2018, in an article headlined “Guam Table Tennis Gets an Olympian.” He said he had arrived to coach and “I am here to stay.”
Within a few hours of the article being published online, the email inbox of the reporter who wrote it, Matt Weiss, filled with messages from Reed and others who told of their experiences with Hyatt. Weiss wrote another article, this one with the headline “Former Olympian on Guam Wanted in California.” The table tennis federation pulled Hyatt’s job offer.
He left Guam for Southeast Asia.
He turned up in the Philippines and assumed a new identity as Anthony Bennett, according to interviews with people there and a copy of the identification he used, which was seen by the Times.
Hyatt continued to meet with women. Several who interacted with him during this time remember him constantly being on his laptop or his phone, moving from one hotel to another, and asking for money. He spoke less of his table tennis past. On a LinkedIn profile, Hyatt claimed he worked as a vice president of sales and marketing for food company ADM from February 2018 to May 2021. A company spokesperson said they did not find “anyone of that name in our records.”
Back in Sacramento, Reed is continuing to improve her credit. She is also in counseling.
“I was so humiliated after this,” she said.
She communicates with others such as Cummins who say they were also duped by Hyatt and occasionally grabs a glass of wine with them. They’ve compared their timelines and credit card statements.
All told, Hyatt now stands accused of defrauding at least 10 people out of a total of several hundred thousand dollars.
“This guy is so good at what he does,” Cummins said. “It makes you feel like you’re kind of crazy, but then you meet these women, and you think, ‘I’m going to be OK.’”
Reed has refrained from dating since her time with Hyatt. She teaches second grade during the day and teaches Pilates in her spare time. And she continues to share her story about her Tinder date with an Olympian that ran amok.
On a recent spring afternoon, she clicked through files on her laptop, her dog, Stella, looking on as the sun set against the shining tiles of the mosaics that adorn the walls of her dining room.
“I have ZERO regrets,” one of the last text messages she received from Hyatt said. “When my time comes to move on from this world to the next I will be proud that I took the road less travelled.”

VW and Rivian Deepen Alliance With Joint Venture: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The new agreement, which builds on an earlier announcement, calls for the German automaker to invest $ 5.8 billion in Rivian, a maker of electric vehicles.
Volkswagen, the German automaker, and Rivian, a California-based maker of electric pickups and S.U.V.s, said on Tuesday that they would form a joint venture to develop software and electronics, extending a partnership they announced in June.
Volkswagen said it would increase its investment with Rivian to $ 5.8 billion from $ 5 billion, which will include a 50 percent stake in the joint venture. While short of an acquisition, the new company broadens the alliance with Rivian and could foreshadow similar partnerships between other established carmakers and new companies struggling to become profitable.
"The partnership with Rivian is the next logical step in our software strategy," Oliver Blume, the chief executive of Volkswagen, said in a statement.
In June, Volkswagen and Rivian had said they would work together on vehicle software -- an area where the German carmaker has struggled. The agreement announced Tuesday goes further by creating an independent company to jointly develop technology for electric vehicles.
The ever-closer association with Volkswagen has helped allay fears that Rivian will run out of money before it becomes profitable. Rivian shares rose 6 percent in extended trading on Tuesday.
Initially the partnership will be focused on developing software for electric vehicles, but could be expanded to include battery modules or other technology, Mr. Blume said during a conference call with reporters. Volkswagen will use the technology in many types of vehicles including subcompacts and cars made by its Audi and Porsche divisions, he said.
Though the world's second-largest carmaker after Toyota, Volkswagen has struggled to make inroads in the United States. Sales of its electric cars here have lagged behind General Motors and Hyundai-Kia. Volkswagen's share of the electric car market in the United States was just 3.4 percent in the third quarter, including the company's Audi and Porsche brands, according to Kelley Blue Book.
The collaboration with Rivian is Volkswagen's second tie-up with another automaker this year aimed at strengthening its software, which has been a notoriously weak point for the German company. In February, Volkswagen announced a partnership with Chinese electric vehicle company Xpeng, aimed at helping it to develop electric cars for China, where it has been steadily losing market share.
Rivian's pickups and sport utility vehicles have received positive reviews in the automotive press, but the company is not selling enough of them to make money. Rivian said last week that it lost $ 1.1 billion in the third quarter, an improvement from the same period in 2023, when it lost $ 1.4 billion. However, deliveries during the quarter fell to 10,000 vehicles, from 15,600 a year earlier, because of a parts shortage.
Volkswagen does not sell a pickup truck in the United States, a handicap in a market where such vehicles are best sellers. But the company is building a factory in South Carolina where it plans to revive the Scout off-road brand with a line of electric S.U.V.s and pickups. Scout will also use technology developed by the VW-Rivian joint venture.
Scout began taking reservations for the vehicles last month, but they will not be available until 2027.
In Europe and China, Volkswagen is trying to cut costs as it faces weak demand for its vehicles. The company also faces high energy and labor costs in Germany, home to many of its factories. The company said last month that its profit in the third quarter fell 42 percent to 2.86 billion euros, or $ 3.1 billion, its lowest level in three years.
Volkswagen has asked its 120,000 workers in Germany to accept wage cuts of 10 percent. The company has threatened to close factories there, too. The company's main union is seeking a 7 percent wage increase and says it may resort to strikes if its demands are not met.
The new joint venture will be known as Rivian and VW Group Technology and will be led by Wassym Bensaid of Rivian and Carsten Helbing of Volkswagen. Its headquarters will be in Palo Alto, Calif.
Volkswagen's $ 5.8 billion investment consists of shares in the joint venture and debt. Of that sum, $ 3.5 billion is conditional on the joint venture achieving "clearly defined milestones," Volkswagen said.

Canada Orders TikTok
To Shut Down Its Offices
The Canadian government on Wednesday directed the video app TikTok, which is owned by a Chinese tech giant, to close its offices in the country because of national security risks.
The app, hugely popular around the world, will still be available for people to use in Canada, said François-Philippe Champagne, the innovation minister, right.
The decision, based on the advice of Canada's security and intelligence community, was meant to address the risks posed by ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, Mr. Champagne said.
Canadian law provides for extra official scrutiny of foreign investments that could endanger national security, Mr. Champagne said.
TikTok said it intended to challenge the order in court.
TikTok faces an outright ban in the United States, as soon as January, over government concerns about security, data privacy and misinformation.
As TikTok's influence with young people has become inescapable, lawmakers in Washington have expressed concern that China could use the app to fuel misinformation. They are also worried that the app could share sensitive user data like location and browsing history with the Chinese government.
Canada banned TikTok from government-issued mobile devices last year. But the app remains one of the most popular in Canada, where it has been downloaded about 700,000 times a month recently. MEAGHAN TOBIN

Nissan Cuts 9,000 Jobs And Slashes C.E.O.'s Pay
Nissan Motor said Thursday that it was planning deep cuts to its global operations as it seeks to reorient its business and recover ground lost in the growing markets for hybrid and electric vehicles in China and the United States.
The Japanese automaker said it would slash 9,000 jobs and reduce its global production capacity by 20 percent. Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida, will take a 50 percent pay cut in his monthly compensation.
Nissan reported on Thursday that global sales declined across its core markets -- North America, China, and Japan -- in the first half of its fiscal year. Nissan's operating profit fell 90 percent, to $ 214 million, during the April-to-September period.
Like many of its peers, including Ford Motor in the United States and Volkswagen in Germany, Nissan has struggled to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences in some of the world's largest car markets.
In China, growing demand for electric vehicles is being largely met by local brands such as BYD, which have churned out low-cost models tailored to the domestic market. The shift has displaced many traditional automakers, including Volkswagen, which had long dominated sales there.
In the United States, electric vehicle sales growth has slowed in recent years, but consumers are increasingly opting for hybrid gas-electric vehicles. This has provided a boost for Toyota, but has hurt sales for automakers like General Motors and Nissan, which lack similar offerings. RIVER AKIRA DAVIS

New Life for Factory Towns Hobbled by 'China Shock': [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Goodman, Peter S

Full text: Communities that suffered the worst of plant closings in recent decades are now gaining an outsize share of fresh investment and new jobs.
For much of the last half century, economic life in the heart of North Carolina has been dominated by factory closings, joblessness and downgraded expectations. Textile mills and furniture plants have been undercut by low-priced imports from Mexico and China. Tobacco processing jobs have disappeared.
Yet over the last several years, an infusion of investment in cutting-edge industries like biotechnology, computer chips and electric vehicles has lifted the fortunes of long-struggling communities.
North Carolina presents a conspicuous example of this trend, yet a similar story is playing out elsewhere. From industrial swaths of the Midwest to factory towns in the South, areas that suffered the most wrenching downsides of trade are now capturing the greatest shares of investment into forward-tilting industries, according to research from the Brookings Institution, a public policy research organization in Washington.
Brookings researchers examined pledges of private investment across the United States, using data compiled by the Biden administration as part of its campaign to subsidize domestic production of computer chips and electric vehicles. They also tapped a Massachusetts Institute of Technology database that tracks investments in clean energy. Over the last three years, $ 736 billion in investment has been promised for these key industries, the researchers found.
When they mapped the investments, the Brookings team concluded that nearly a third of the total is flowing into communities that experienced the worst effects of the so-called China Shock -- the factory closures that followed China's entry to the global trading system in 2001.
"There's still an orientation toward production in these places," said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro and one of the authors of the study. Even as technology advances and products change, traditional manufacturing areas tend to retain the acumen and skills needed to make things, he said.
Those findings have undercut the tone of fatalism that often colors conversations about the risks of trade and automation, lending credence to the notion that government has tools to soften the effects for workers and communities: Targeted grants can spur the development of strategically important industries while yielding middle-class paychecks.
That takeaway is especially relevant given intensifying worries about a potential new China Shock. As the country's economy slows, limiting the willingness of its consumers to spend, the Chinese government is steering more credit to exporters. That is sending growing volumes of goods into world markets, threatening factory jobs in higher-wage nations.
"These shocks are not one-offs," Mr. Muro said. "They will be frequent. They are, unfortunately, part of the rocky ride you get by participating in a global economy."
Ahead of a presidential election that may hinge on economic sentiments, the findings appear to bolster the case for so-called industrial policy, in which the government subsidizes strategic industries. The campaign has featured contrasting conceptions of how the United States should manage the opportunities and challenges of international trade.
Former President Donald J. Trump has described Chinese industry as a mortal threat to American livelihoods, while promising to impose steep tariffs on imports from China. Economists warn that this course risks lifting prices for many goods while undermining the competitiveness of factories in the United States that depend on imported components to make their products.
The Biden administration -- while retaining and advancing many of the tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump -- has also embraced subsidies in strategic industries to encourage American production. Economists have criticized that approach as a form of trade protectionism that imperils American alliances. The political risks are heightened by the reality that the benefits are likely to take years and billions of dollars in investment to emerge.
The Brookings research suggests that the benefits of subsidizing industry could be in the pipeline, at least in places like Chatham County, N.C.
For decades, the county suffered the consequences as furniture manufacturing and textile jobs vanished. It largely missed out on the biotechnology boom that played out to the northeast, in the Raleigh-Durham area.
Between 1992 and 2023, manufacturing as a share of total employment in Chatham County dropped to 10 percent from 47 percent, according to data from the NC Budget & Tax Center.
Yet the county has harnessed its abundance of developable land and its legacy as a center for manufacturing to attract major investments.
In June 2023, Wolfspeed, a company that makes raw materials for computer chips used in electric vehicles, broke ground on a plant occupying 450 acres in the town of Siler City, home to about 8,000 people.
A $ 5 billion investment, the new factory recently gained approval from the Commerce Department for a $ 750 million federal grant under the CHIPS and Science Act -- a centerpiece of the Biden administration's campaign to make computer chips in the United States.
"This is going to allow us to build out the manufacturing lines faster," said Wolfspeed's chief executive, Gregg Lowe.
The company anticipates beginning production in the middle of next year, eventually generating 1,800 jobs. Building the facility has created paychecks for some 2,800 construction workers.
Wolfspeed picked the site in part because it already held the infrastructure to deliver enormous volumes of water -- a carry-over from its previous incarnation as a center for textiles. Wolfspeed's technology, which centers on a material called silicon carbide, entails growing crystals in temperatures reaching 4,500 degrees (2,500 degrees Celsius), or roughly half the temperature of the surface of the sun. Water is crucial for the cooling process.
Elsewhere in Chatham County, a Vietnamese company that makes electric vehicles, VinFast, has pledged to invest $ 4 billion on a new factory that it said would employ some 7,500 people. Development has been repeatedly delayed, but work on the factory is expected to begin this year, said Michael Smith, president of the Chatham County Economic Development Corporation.
Just to the west, in neighboring Randolph County, Toyota is testing its initial batch of electric vehicle batteries at a new factory -- a $ 14 billion investment. North Carolina also boasts mines and refineries for lithium, a key raw material for batteries.
Collectively, these operations have transformed a region once synonymous with decline into a hub for forward-looking industry.
"That's the full stack for building electric vehicles," said Aaron Chatterji, an economist at Duke University who previously helped to establish the CHIPS Act. "You're building a cluster that we can continue to build on."
In Michigan, another state long characterized by diminished industry, prospects are being revived by investments in electric vehicle and battery plants.
In Flint, the birthplace of General Motors, a Chicago-based company called NanoGraf is constructing a factory to make components for batteries. It was recently awarded a $ 60 million Department of Energy grant.
The plant is being erected on land that was previously home to Buick City, a factory complex where 30,000 people worked in the heyday of the American auto industry.
Representative Dan Kildee, a Democrat whose district includes Flint, but who is not running for re-election, grew up within blocks of the Buick City plant. His grandfather, a former lumberjack, moved there for a job on the assembly line. Wage earners drove home in cars they helped build and spent vacations in lakefront cottages.
When jobs were shipped to lower-wage countries, the damage went beyond finances, seeping into the psyche of the community. The abandonment of Buick City in 1999 cemented Flint's status as a fallen icon.
Now, a new sense of confidence is palpable. "There's this sort of turning of the page in this region," Mr. Kildee, 66, said.
NanoGraf saw in Flint a community with roots in manufacturing where skilled people could be trained by community colleges to handle the needed work.
Company leaders also appreciated the symbolic power of advancing electric vehicles on the same ground that was integral to the rise of gas-powered cars in the previous century.
"It's about revitalizing the community," Francis Wang, the company's chief executive, said. "We're transforming the Rust Belt into the Battery Belt."

Why There’s Hope for U.S. Factory Towns Laid Low by the ‘China Shock’

For much of the past half-century, economic life in the heart of North Carolina has been dominated by factory closings, joblessness and downgraded expectations. Textile mills and furniture plants have been undercut by low-priced imports from Mexico and China. Tobacco processing jobs have disappeared.
Yet over the past several years, an infusion of investment in cutting-edge industries such as biotechnology, computer chips and electric vehicles has lifted the fortunes of long-struggling communities.
North Carolina presents a conspicuous example of this trend, yet a similar story is playing out elsewhere. From industrial swathes of the Midwest to factory towns in the South, areas that suffered the most wrenching downsides of trade are now capturing the greatest shares of investment into forward-tilting industries, according to research from the Brookings Institution, a public policy research organization in Washington.
Brookings researchers examined pledges of private investment across the United States, using data compiled by the Biden administration as part of its campaign to subsidize domestic production of computer chips and electric vehicles. They also tapped a Massachusetts Institute of Technology database that tracks investments in clean energy. Over the past three years, $736 billion in investment has been promised for these key industries, the researchers found.
When they mapped the investments, the Brookings team concluded that nearly a third of the total is flowing into communities that experienced the worst effects of the so-called China Shock — the factory closures that followed China’s entry to the global trading system in 2001.
“There’s still an orientation toward production in these places,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro and one of the authors of the study. Even as technology advances and products change, traditional manufacturing areas tend to retain the acumen and skills needed to make things, he said.
Those findings have undercut the tone of fatalism that often colors conversations about the risks of trade and automation, lending credence to the notion that government has tools to soften the effects for workers and communities: Targeted grants can spur the development of strategically important industries while yielding middle-class paychecks.
That takeaway is especially relevant given intensifying worries about a potential new China Shock. As the country’s economy slows, limiting the willingness of its consumers to spend, the Chinese government is steering more credit to exporters. That is sending growing volumes of goods into world markets, threatening factory jobs in higher-wage nations.
“These shocks are not one-offs,” Muro said. “They will be frequent. They are, unfortunately, part of the rocky ride you get by participating in a global economy.”
Before a presidential election that may hinge on economic sentiments, the findings appear to bolster the case for so-called industrial policy, in which the government subsidizes strategic industries. The campaign has featured contrasting conceptions of how the United States should manage the opportunities and challenges of international trade.
Former President Donald Trump has described Chinese industry as a mortal threat to American livelihoods, while promising to impose steep tariffs on imports from China. Economists warn that this course risks lifting prices for many goods while undermining the competitiveness of factories in the United States that depend on imported components to make their products.
The Biden administration — while retaining and advancing many of the tariffs imposed by Trump — has also embraced subsidies in strategic industries to encourage American production. Economists have criticized that approach as a form of trade protectionism that imperils American alliances. The political risks are heightened by the reality that the benefits are likely to take years and billions of dollars in investment to emerge.
The Brookings research suggests that the benefits of subsidizing industry could be in the pipeline, at least in places like Chatham County, North Carolina.
For decades, the county suffered the consequences as furniture manufacturing and textile jobs vanished. It largely missed out on the biotechnology boom that played out to the northeast, in the Raleigh-Durham area.
Between 1992 and 2023, manufacturing as a share of total employment in Chatham County dropped to 10% from 47%, according to data from the NC Budget & Tax Center.
Yet the county has harnessed its abundance of developable land and its legacy as a center for manufacturing to attract major investments.
In June 2023, Wolfspeed, a company that makes raw materials for computer chips used in electric vehicles, broke ground on a plant occupying 450 acres in the town of Siler City, home to about 8,000 people.
A $5 billion investment, the new factory recently gained approval from the Commerce Department for a $750 million federal grant under the CHIPS and Science Act — a centerpiece of the Biden administration’s campaign to make computer chips in the United States.
“This is going to allow us to build out the manufacturing lines faster,” said Wolfspeed’s CEO, Gregg Lowe.
The company anticipates beginning production in the middle of next year, eventually generating 1,800 jobs. Building the facility has created paychecks for some 2,800 construction workers.
Wolfspeed chose the site in part because it already held the infrastructure to deliver enormous volumes of water — a carry-over from its previous incarnation as a center for textiles. Wolfspeed’s technology, which centers on a material called silicon carbide, entails growing crystals in temperatures reaching 4,500 degrees (2,500 degrees Celsius), or roughly half the temperature of the surface of the sun. Water is crucial for the cooling process.
Elsewhere in Chatham County, a Vietnamese company that makes electric vehicles, VinFast, has pledged to invest $4 billion on a new factory that it said would employ some 7,500 people. Development has been repeatedly delayed, but work on the factory is expected to begin this year, said Michael Smith, president of the Chatham County Economic Development Corp.
Just to the west, in neighboring Randolph County, Toyota is testing its initial batch of electric vehicle batteries at a new factory — a $14 billion investment. North Carolina also boasts mines and refineries for lithium, a key raw material for batteries.
Collectively, these operations have transformed a region once synonymous with decline into a hub for forward-looking industry.
“That’s the full stack for building electric vehicles,” said Aaron Chatterji, an economist at Duke University who previously helped to establish the CHIPS Act. “You’re building a cluster that we can continue to build on.”

Full text: Darian Aaron wasn't looking for anything serious when he downloaded Tinder four years ago. Then he met Marcus Gresham.
Months before he met Marcus Rafeal Donte Gresham on Tinder in November 2020, Darian Lamon Aaron got behind the wheel of his Toyota Camry and cried from Miami to Atlanta.
"I was just sobbing," Mr. Aaron said, recalling how he drove along Interstate 95 with the Ariana Grande song "Thank U, Next" on repeat. He had moved to Miami in April 2020 to be with his fiancé, and after a nearly decade-long on-again, off-again relationship, they had broken up.
In Atlanta, the city he considers home, his job at as a journalist at the Counter Narrative Project -- a nonprofit organization focused on the representation of Black queer and gay men in media, awaited him. Vestiges of a former love life did not. He downloaded Tinder that fall, though it was more of an insurance policy against loneliness than a signal of his openness to romance. "I wasn't looking to be in another relationship," said Mr. Aaron, 44, who is now the director of local news, U.S. South, at GLAAD, an L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy group.
Neither he nor Mr. Gresham can remember who reached out first on Tinder that November, or even who asked to meet in person after six days of messaging and several phone calls. However, both recall a conversation that led them to develop a feeling of mutual respect for each other.
"Therapy came up," said Mr. Gresham, 43, a professional backup singer. "That was an instant thing for us, because it was like, oh wow, there's someone doing the work to make sure he's the best version of himself." When they met for a first date at Ponce City Market in Atlanta on Nov. 22, "we showed up our full, authentic selves and laid it all on the table," Mr. Aaron said.
That table was at a Chinese restaurant, one of the market's dining spots. "We always joke that he must have put something in my shrimp fried rice," said Mr. Gresham, who was then working as a customer service representative at White Cap, a wholesale building materials company. "I haven't been able to be without him since, nor have I wanted to."
Within a week, they had met for a second date at Atlanta Botanical Garden. Mr. Aaron was moving to a new apartment at the time. "Before I knew it, Marcus was there every weekend," he said. In March 2021, Mr. Aaron told Mr. Gresham he loved him. "It just slipped out," he said. "Marcus saw the look of shock on my face, and he said, 'It's OK."' Minutes later, Mr. Gresham told Mr. Aaron that he loved him, too. The moment solidified their commitment to each other, they said.

Mr. Aaron grew up in Montgomery, Ala., and graduated from Alabama State University with a bachelor's degree in communications. He came out to his parents when he was 16. "I had to liberate myself," he said. "The only thing in my closet is clothes."
At 18, he moved to Manhattan to study musical theater at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. After two semesters, he left school to work as a performer, singing and dancing in touring productions on cruise ships and at theme parks. He was in his mid-30s and working full time as a flight attendant at Republic Airways when he started attending Alabama State University, sometimes hopping on a plane on standby to make it to class.
Mr. Gresham is an Atlanta native who grew up singing, beginning at age 4 in choruses and choirs, he said. Black Southern Baptist churches were his training grounds. An aunt who taught him to harmonize with a cousin was one of his first vocal teachers. "When my family gets together, it's nothing for us to get together in song," he said. "We'll start singing gospel, R&B, anything." He attended Mercer University with plans to eventually earn a law degree, but he dropped out for financial reasons; music had long felt more compelling anyway.
Mr. Gresham identifies as pansexual. He was 28 when he told his family. Their acceptance of him is "a combination of total and conditional," he said. After Mr. Gresham proposed on Feb. 10 at the home he and Mr. Aaron moved into in Marietta, Ga., in 2022, they started planning a wedding -- but not everyone was ready to celebrate. A few of their loved ones had religious objections to attending a gay wedding, Mr. Aaron said.
But on Oct. 20, when they were married at Glover Park Brewery in Marietta, the support of their 110 guests overshadowed any absences. Mashaun D. Simon, a former pastor with the nondenominational House of Mercy Everlasting church, who is also affiliated with the Fellowship of Affirming Ministries, officiated the ceremony. Instead of bridesmaids and groomsmen, their wedding party consisted of what they called "he/hims" and "she/hers."
A level of curiosity among guests was expected, Mr. Aaron said. "A lot of them come from traditional Southern Christian backgrounds and have never been to a gay wedding," he said. Worrying about their guests' perceptions, especially toward their first kiss as a married couple, was unavoidable leading up to the celebration, they said, but it didn't temper their passion on the day of. "In the moment," Mr. Gresham said, "all of those nerves went away."

This Anti-D.E.I. Agitator Strikes Fear Into Big Companies: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: From his home in Tennessee, the social media rabble-rouser Robby Starbuck is waging war on "woke" policies at places like Lowe's and Ford. His timing is impeccable.
In early June, Robby Starbuck sat on the screened-in patio of his home in suburban Tennessee and recorded an eight-minute monologue on his mobile phone -- a no-frills, TikTok-style video entitled "Exposed: Tractor Supply Went Woke."
"All right y'all," he began, "you're going to want to see this."
Speaking in tones that swung between urgent, amused and appalled, Mr. Starbuck listed an inventory of what he considered to be outrages committed by Tractor Supply, which sells feed and farm equipment.
The company hung Pride flags at a distribution center, he said. It offered equal health care for transgender people. It sponsored a Pride event near its headquarters in Brentwood, Tenn. It provided unconscious bias training for 40,000 employees. It paid $ 50 to employees who got the Covid vaccine.
Mr. Starbuck, a 35-year-old former music video producer, wrapped up with a call to boycott the company until it changed course and dropped its policies aimed at diversity, equity and inclusion.
"So now everybody, remind Tractor Supply who their customers actually are," he said.
With 674,000 followers on X and 353,000 followers on Instagram, Mr. Starbuck has a not-exactly-gigantic fan base when measured against other influencers'. But his posts about Tractor Supply -- roughly 30 in total, over the course of a few weeks -- were forwarded and posted so often that the name of the company started trending on X.
The company, which has nearly $ 15 billion in annual revenue, took notice. On June 27, it announced in a statement that it would retire its D.E.I. goals. It would stop sponsoring pride festivals. And it would no longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign, the Washington, D.C., nonprofit that grades companies on their policies when it comes to L.G.B.T.Q. workers.
"We have heard from customers that we have disappointed them," the company wrote. "We have taken this feedback to heart."
The reversal made national headlines and ushered a clamorous new voice into a highly divisive issue. In the months that followed, Mr. Starbuck kept prodding one of the more jangled nerves of the body politic, posting a series of similar videos about John Deere, Harley-Davidson, Caterpillar, Stanley Black & Decker, Jack Daniel's, Lowe's, Ford Motor, Molson Coors and, most recently, Toyota. All have since announced retreats from their D.E.I. policies, though almost none would discuss their reasons for this article.
His playbook is to exhort his audience to pressure companies and threaten them with economic pain. For corporations, the worst-case fate is what happened to Bud Light in 2023, after it formed a partnership with the social media influencer and trans activist Dylan Mulvaney. Detractors howled -- Kid Rock posted a video of himself machine gunning Bud Light cases -- and sales plummeted.
Mr. Starbuck says his posts and videos on X have been viewed hundreds of million of times per month, and claims they have occasionally slashed billions of dollars from the market cap of companies, all of which are publicly traded.
His videos "have a material effect that's not lost on us," Mr. Starbuck said during a recent interview at his home about 20 miles south of Nashville. "But what's interesting is, when they've turned around" -- when the companies change their D.E.I. policies, which he announces in a triumphant follow-up video -- "stock's fine. It goes up. Everything's good."
Wall Street analysts doubt that Mr. Starbuck has had such puppeteer-like control over share prices, which they say have risen and fallen for unrelated reasons. And in some cases, the changes that mollified Mr. Starbuck, and caused him to declare victory, seemed far from momentous.
Still, his campaign is nothing if not well timed. More than 30 states have introduced or enacted laws curtailing or eliminating D.E.I. initiatives in higher education. The topic has surfaced in the presidential race, with former President Donald J. Trump vowing that, if re-elected, he would review and reverse any actions taken by federal agencies under what he called President Biden's "equity agenda." A Bloomberg headline put it bluntly: "Corporate America Braces for D.E.I.'s Death if Trump Wins."
It's part of an atmospheric change hastened by the Supreme Court ruling last year that rejected affirmative action at universities and colleges. That decision prompted corporations to worry that their D.E.I. programs could be challenged next, a fear that grew after a number of law firms were sued for diversity fellowship programs by the lawyer Edward Blum, who prevailed in the university affirmative action case.
Google and Meta pulled back from their D.E.I. programs last year. Others have renamed them. The Society for Human Resource Management, an organization for H.R. professionals, announced in July that it was dropping the "equity" part of its D.E.I. program because it had become a "distraction."
Which is not to say that diversity drives have been canceled. The Human Rights Campaign says that the number of companies participating in its scorecard, the Corporate Equality Index, will reach a record high next year: 1,400. Despite Tractor Supply and other companies dropping out, that's a five percent increase over this year's numbers.
"I think it's a steady progression forward at a time when we're experiencing backlash," said Kelley Robinson, the president of the H.R.C. And the loudest proponents of that backlash are having a moment. Robby Starbuck, she said, is one of a handful of "extremist conservative activists that are doing all they can to pull back the progress that we've made."
He's one of the flashier lights in a constellation of anti-D.E.I. media personalities. Together, they are complicating the choices of chief executives who are trying to build and nurture a diverse work force while also searching for a middle path that will infuriate the smallest number of employees and consumers.
The problem is that the line they are carefully treading has moved. Momentum around the topic has shifted and, in ways, so has the law. After the murder of George Floyd in 2020, said Julie Levinson Werner, an employment lawyer, "I got a lot of calls from companies saying, 'What is our D.E.I.? What are we doing? How are we investing? Can we hire a special intern?"'
She doesn't get those calls anymore.
"Now it's: 'Should we revisit this? Should we call it something different? Will this pass muster?"'
A Sinister Plot
Mr. Starbuck pulls his dark, shoulder-length hair into a man bun; when we met, he wore an untucked navy shirt, bluejeans and black cowboy boots, looking like a guy ready to line dance in a honky-tonk. As a self-professed homebody, that's a place you are unlikely to find him. He speaks much as he does in his videos, in an even and nearly nonstop torrent of words. He is friendly, intense and expansive.
"I'm guilty of being a rambler, which my wife will tell you," he said.
He had just ended a quick tour of what he calls his farm, which consists of chickens, a cow, a bull and some rabbits. His black Tesla sits in the driveway. The interior of his house looks like a smartly furnished and very spacious model home. His wife, Landon, is a singer and songwriter who is "passionate about faith, family, freedom, truth and justice for the vulnerable," as it says on her website. The couple have four children.
Mr. Starbuck sat on the same patio where he recorded many of his videos, using nothing but his mobile phone. Two employees work in a small studio on the second floor of a building attached to the house, gathering information and helping with production. A "liberty or death" flag hangs on the wall. More videos are in the works, including attacks on the D.E.I. policies of companies with a customer base he describes as "50-50," which is to say that they are appealing to customers on both sides of the political divide, rather than ones that presumably rely primarily on conservative buyers, like Tractor Supply.
Born Robby Starbuck Newsom, he grew up in Temecula, Calif., a city between San Diego and Los Angeles. His mother is an immigrant from Cuba; he had a troubled relationship with his American father, now deceased.
Mr. Starbuck graduated from high school at 16, and dropped out of community college to work for a video production company. Through that job and others, he earned enough to buy video recording equipment and start a production company of his own in Los Angeles. He made music videos for Snoop Dogg, Smashing Pumpkins and other acts. For a time, he and his family lived in the same gated community as the Kardashians.
He came to loathe his work. He had married Landon when he was 18 years old, and they started having children. As a new father, he felt that the entertainment industry was pumping cultural bile intended for teens into the American bloodstream. He saw a malign force at work, and behind that force, the Democratic Party.
"Entertainment was being used as a weapon to engineer specific political beliefs and to openly sexualize kids," he wrote in a text, "because ultimately, overly sexualized kids will eventually vote for the party that promotes the most hedonistic behavior."
His role in the entertainment industry started to feel like a form of cowardice. All the more so after he gave his life to Jesus, as he put it. He had always been a Republican, but by the time Mr. Trump came along for his first presidential run, Mr. Starbuck concluded that he was in the wrong place and the wrong business. On his social media channels, Mr. Starbuck embraced the candidate, fully understanding that it would have a self-immolating impact on his career in a liberal bastion. He says that 85 percent of his clients, which included major labels, dropped him.
"He pretty much got canceled out of the industry," said Matthew Stevenson, a cinematographer who worked with Mr. Starbuck.
Mr. Starbuck and his family relocated to Tennessee in 2018, a place he barely knew, but where he felt he would find people with values more aligned with his own. He says he supports his campaigns with investments of money from his video production company, now defunct; an undisclosed number of $ 5-a-month subscribers to his X channel; and from proceeds from his 2024 documentary, "The War on Children."
The film, his most ambitious foray into activist media, covers a litany of familiar problems: The rise of gender dysphoria; alarming rates of depression among children; easy access to pornography. The film also captures his antipathy toward transgender rights activism, a frequent target of his current anti-D.E.I. campaign.
As director, reporter and narrator, Mr. Starbuck argues that American children now live in a terrifying hellscape of predators -- greedy corporations, left-leaning politicians, witless school boards, all of them in the thrall of a woke agenda. Their efforts, he says through interviews and over a stirring score, will result in nothing less than a Marxist government.
The film captures what is so tricky about Mr. Starbuck's work. He starts with an ember of reality -- teenage depression rates are really rising, for instance -- and fans it into an unrecognizable political apocalypse.
His objections to D.E.I. are similarly alarmist. He doesn't see the initiatives as merely misguided, dumb or wasteful. To him, they are part of a sinister plot by the Democratic Party to shove the country toward communism.
"We have a bunch of left-wing authoritarian-like figures now who understand that it's a major optics hit to come out and say, 'I'm a communist,"' he said. "What you need is to be able to control the ideology, the minds of the people who are in control of the means of production and corporations."
In his videos, Mr. Starbuck rarely emphasizes the idea of a communist takeover. Instead, critics say, he cherry picks well-intentioned elements of D.E.I. and recasts them as wokeness run amok.
"Part of the danger of Starbuck's rhetoric is that it focuses on one divisive dimension of D.E.I." -- like Pride flags at Tractor Supply's distribution center -- "and misrepresents it as the wholeness of it, without understanding that these policies have implications for pay equity for women, for stamping out antisemitism, for creating inclusive workplace environments for veterans and so on," said Shaun Harper, a professor of business, education and public policy at the University of Southern California. "It's a misrepresentation of the facts as opposed to straight up lies."
Mr. Starbuck's worldview was shaped by his maternal great-grandfather, who lived through the rise of Fidel Castro in Cuba, and told his great-grandson that nobody saw the perils of the regime until it was too late. Before the dictatorship, there had been lots of uplifting talk about free health care and racial justice, which sounds, to Mr. Starbuck's ears, a lot like the rhetoric of purportedly well-meaning Democrats.
The more you talk to Mr. Starbuck, the more you grasp that he sees danger, invisible to most, everywhere. During our visit, he mused about an experiment, conducted by a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in which frogs were exposed to a common herbicide called Atrazine.
"The end result," he said, "is that the majority of the frogs turned gay."
Actually, the experiment found that many of the frogs became hermaphrodites. But the idea that a chemical turns frogs into homosexuals, and that it could do the same to humans, lives on. Its most vocal proponent is the conspiracy theorist and disinformation profiteer Alex Jones.
By contrast, Mr. Starbuck appears utterly sincere -- about gay frogs, a Communist plot, everything. He's on the attack because he is certain that he, and every lucid American, is locked in a battle, whether they know it or not.
"The question we face now," he says at the end of "The War on Children," "is whether good or evil will win this war."
Backlash to the Backlash
Mr. Starbuck's social media following has its roots in his days as a music video director, when he was posting on social media about current events and stars like Akon. His numbers increased after his pivot to politics, and today, the relatively modest size of his audience is multiplied by a cadre of X accounts, YouTube channels and TikTokers, some of them well known ("The Dennis Prager Show," NewsMax), some part of an ecosystem of conservative bro social media sites and podcasts (The Quartering, Benny Johnson).
These sites amplify an idea that seems to be gaining traction: That many D.E.I. programs have features that annoy as many people as they edify.
"I do think a lot of white, middle-class Americans, working-class Americans, are pretty fed up with diversity programs as they experienced them at work," said Frank Dobbin, a professor of sociology at Harvard University and the author of "Inventing Equal Opportunity," a book about workplace discrimination. "In part, it's because they've been having the same poorly designed diversity training for the last 20 years, where they've been called racist, sexist bigots."
The programs haven't always helped employers diversify the work force, he added. This frustrates employees, including those who want more diversity, and may explain why support for D.E.I. is a mixed picture. A Pew Research Center survey last year found that 56 percent of employed adults thought focusing on increasing D.E.I. in the workplace was a good idea; 16 percent said it was a bad idea. Twenty-eight percent of Black employees felt their companies weren't doing enough.
Along with D.E.I. fatigue, what's unfolding now is arguably the latest example of a pattern in this country that is as fixed as a rule of physics: Any force applied to elevate minorities will eventually be met with a counterforce. As Professor Dobbin noted, the success of the civil rights movement of the 1960s led to the rise of George Wallace, an Alabama segregationist who stoked racial resentments when he ran for president in 1972. Corporations reacted to the Black Lives Matter protests by expanding D.E.I.; a counterreaction is now underway.
Mr. Starbuck nearly always interprets corporate responses to his campaigns as complete surrender and often overstates his financial effect on corporate profits. On Aug. 15, he implied on X that a $ 1.2 billion drop in John Deere's third-quarter sales was his doing. (He had posted his first video about the company five weeks earlier.) "Wokeness destroys businesses," he wrote.
Wall Street analysts had a different take. Some large farmers were giving "serious consideration" to switching brands as a result of Mr. Starbuck's video, a research note written by Greg Badishkanian of Wolfe Research said. But analysts blamed the drop on interest rate changes and weak crop prices. (These analysts work for "woke" institutions, Mr. Starbuck countered.)
A spokesman for Ford, the only company targeted by Mr. Starbuck that would speak for this article, said it made the decision not to participate in H.R.C.'s Corporate Equality Index scoring system before Mr. Starbuck was in touch.
"We decided to look at what kind of workplace we want to foster as opposed to meeting the guidelines of other people's surveys," said Richard Binhammer, the spokesman.
Whether Mr. Starbuck caused the changes or merely caught the shifting direction of the wind, some companies are hiring public relations specialists and law firms to gird against his attacks. Corporations tend to change course, to varying degrees, once they are in his sights. Molson Coors, Lowe's, Harley-Davidson and others have said they will sponsor only events core to the company's business. (In Molson's case, that means "Hometown communities" and goals like alcohol responsibility.) Harley also ended "socially motivated content" in employee training programs.
At the same time, many companies announced their changes while restating a broad commitment to a diverse workplace. More than anything, the chief executives appear eager to minimize static and appease everybody, which is perhaps what they've always wanted. It's just become harder to achieve.
In fact, the backlash to D.E.I. may already be producing a backlash of its own. After Tractor Supply and John Deere announced their post-Starbuck D.E.I. policies, the National Black Farmers Association declared that both would be boycotted.
"I see it as going backward," said John Boyd, the founder of the N.B.F.A. "When they say they are doing away with their diversity programs, that sends the wrong signal."
Mr. Starbuck says he's heard from 5,000 people who want to spill about their companies and that he will contact many in the coming months. What he wants more than anything is a future in which everyone looks at this complicated topic -- one that ropes in thorny and nuanced questions about race, history and fairness -- and adopts his very uncomplicated solution.
One fine day, executives all over the country will wake up and say, "You know what? We're going to stop being crazy," and just return to what he calls American values.
Could it be any simpler?

Ford Took Early Lead in E.V.s. Now G.M. Is Surging.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ford is struggling to make money on battery-powered models while General Motors, which started more slowly, says it is getting close to that goal.
In the race to be second to Tesla in the U.S. electric vehicle market, Ford Motor leaped to an early lead four years ago over its crosstown rival, General Motors, with the Mustang Mach E, an electric sport utility vehicle with a design and a name that nodded to its classic sports car.
But the contest looks much different today.
Sales of G.M.'s battery-powered models are starting to surge as the company begins to reap its big investments in standardized batteries and new factories. Ford's three electric models, including the F-150 Lightning pickup truck and a Transit van, are still selling well but are racking up billions of dollars of losses.
The latest view into how Ford's quick-start strategy has run into trouble came on Monday, when the company reported that its electric vehicle division lost $ 1.2 billion before interest and taxes from July to September. In the first nine months of the year, it lost $ 3.7 billion.
Ford's chief financial officer, John Lawler, said it was a "solid quarter," noting that revenue had risen for the 10th quarter in a row, by 5 percent to $ 46.2 billion. But the company's overall profit of $ 896 million in the third quarter was down 24 percent from a year earlier, largely because of problems with electric vehicles, warranty costs and other factors.
"Our strategic advantages are not falling to the bottom line the way they should because of cost," Mr. Lawler said.
Most automakers other than Tesla are also losing money on electric vehicles and struggling to find their footing. They include Volkswagen, the world's second-largest automaker after Toyota, and Rivian, a start-up once regarded by auto experts as the next Tesla.
But Ford's challenges stand in stark contrast to the recent gains by G.M., its main U.S. competitor. G.M. executives say they are close to breaking even on its electric cars by one important measure.
Last week, G.M. reported a $ 3 billion profit for the third quarter, about the same as a year earlier. Its full-year earnings are likely to approach or surpass $ 10 billion and could set a record.
Like Ford, G.M. is losing money on battery-powered models, but it does not provide a specific figure. It has said, however, that it expects those models to start generating "variable profits" by the end of the year. That means each electric car or truck it sells will make money as long as fixed costs like the money spent on factories, machinery and development are not factored in.
"We're making substantial progress on our E.V. journey toward profitability," G.M.'s chief financial officer, Paul Jacobson, said in a conference call last week.
A big part of the difference between the two companies, both based in Michigan, is how they approached the new technology. Ford developed the Mach E and Lightning, which preceded the Tesla Cybertruck pickup by more than a year and a half, quickly, in part by using battery packs made by suppliers. LG Energy Solution, a South Korean company, makes Mach E batteries in Poland. The Lightning uses a battery pack made by SK On in Commerce, Ga. Some Mach E batteries are also made in China by Contemporary Amperex Technology Company, known as CATL.
Ford also built dedicated assembly lines for both models and, after strong initial sales, expanded capacity. Then consumer interest cooled, and the company had to quickly cut production and prices, putting profits further out of reach.
Ford's third model, an electric Transit delivery van, is bought mainly by businesses. The company has not expanded its consumer models beyond the Lightning and Mach E, recently suspending work on a large electric S.U.V.
G.M., by comparison, moved slowly at first, producing primarily the Chevrolet Bolt compact. The company took years to develop modular battery packs that are now allowing it to use the same components in many vehicles. It also started building battery factories in a joint venture with LG Energy Solution.
The idea was to reap economies of scale by using similar batteries in many models -- large pickup trucks, opulent Cadillacs and practical family crossovers.
The go-slow approach seems to be paying off. G.M.'s first battery factory, in Warren, Ohio, struggled to get going but is now operating at about 80 percent of its capacity, Mr. Jacobson said. A second battery plant, near Nashville, is at 40 percent and rising.
"Every cell that is produced is cheaper under our joint venture arrangement," Mr. Jacobson said. "That's beginning to bring pretty significant benefits."
G.M. has introduced nine electric models using similar batteries, allowing it to appeal to a wide range of consumers. Several more are on the way, including a battery-powered version of its popular Cadillac Escalade S.U.V. Ford's Mach E, Lightning and Transit don't use the same battery components as extensively as G.M.'s cars and trucks.
In the third quarter, G.M. sold more than 32,000 electric models in the United States, about 8,600 more than Ford, according to Kelley Blue Book, a research firm. One model is a Chevrolet Equinox S.U.V. that starts at $ 35,000; the cost to buyers is lower because the vehicle qualifies for a $ 7,500 federal tax credit.
The starting price of the Mach E is just under $ 40,000, and because its battery packs are made outside the United States, buyers are not eligible for a tax credit; the credit may still be available to customers who lease the car.
"G.M. seems to have figured out a way to put out lower-cost, high-efficiency E.V.s," Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst, said.
Ford has been working to streamline its electric vehicle operations. Mr. Lawler said its electric vehicle division had reduced costs by $ 1 billion this year. Soon, LG Energy Solution will start making Mach E batteries in Michigan, so the vehicle will be eligible for the federal tax credit.
Ford is also building battery plants of its own, one in Kentucky and another in Tennessee, in partnership with SK. A third is being built in Michigan and is wholly owned by Ford. The company says the plants will produce battery packs at much lower costs.
In addition, Ford promises that a new pickup truck set to go into production will be more appealing and cost less, and it has an engineering group in California working to develop affordable battery-powered models.
"We have learned a tremendous amount from consumers," Mr. Lawler said. "Most of our competitors are launching their first-generation vehicles. We are moving into our second generation."

Harris, a Crimefighter by Day, Courted High Society at Night: [National Desk]

Full text: As Kamala Harris toiled as a junior prosecutor in Alameda County, Calif., she developed important connections among San Francisco's financial and social elite.
In August 1996, a jury in an Oakland, Calif., courtroom convicted a man of slicing off a portion of his girlfriend's scalp. The prosecutor was Kamala Harris, and the gruesome case was one of the few that made news early in her career.
"It was a vicious crime," Ms. Harris told The Oakland Tribune. She was in her seventh year as a rank-and-file prosecutor in Alameda County, doing battle with suspected drug lords and murderers in Oakland, which was still contending with the crack epidemic.
Weeks later, Ms. Harris was back in the news, this time across the bay in San Francisco as a boldface name in the society pages, among the young and fashionable who had gathered for a martini party at a Polo Ralph Lauren store ahead of the Fall Antiques Show. It was hosted by a group of art lovers who called themselves the Young Collectors, raising money for underserved children while collecting "antiques, art, knowledge -- and parties," Pat Steger, The San Francisco Chronicle's society editor and columnist, wrote.
During these formative years, when Ms. Harris was in her 20s and 30s, her life ran along two tracks that proved pivotal to her political ascendancy. By day, she developed the courtroom skills that have shaped her methodical approach as a candidate. By night, she moved through San Francisco high society, nurturing the financial and political connections that became instrumental in her national rise.
Ms. Harris, who grew up in a modest neighborhood in Berkeley, Calif., with a single mother, showed a talent for forging relationships with some of California's most influential elites while she was still a young prosecutor.
She dated Willie Brown, one of the most powerful legislators in state history who became mayor of San Francisco. She cultivated relationships with Susie Tompkins Buell, the founder of two iconic clothing brands, and Laurene Powell Jobs, a businesswoman who was married to Steve Jobs, the entrepreneur who made Apple a tech powerhouse.
"The ability to have people want to open up to you is not that different in a courtroom than it is in a cocktail party," said Teresa Drenick, who worked with Ms. Harris as a prosecutor in the 1990s. The Gritty Streets of 1990s Oakland
The Alameda County District Attorney's Office was for decades known as a place for ambitious lawyers to cut their teeth. When Ms. Harris arrived, Oakland was struggling at the tail end of the crack epidemic, and the war on drugs was in full force and homicides were at near record levels.
"When I was coming out of law school and you wanted to be a D.A., you wanted to be either in Alameda County or Manhattan," Ms. Drenick said. "Those were the golden rings of D.A. offices at the time."
A few years before Ms. Harris joined the office, Felix Mitchell, an infamous drug lord in Oakland whose career was an inspiration for the movie "New Jack City," had been arrested by the F.B.I. and later stabbed to death in prison. That led to a leadership vacuum on the streets, as new drug bosses violently competed for territory.
"The Oakland that me and Kamala came into was an Oakland where his top lieutenants and new players in the game were recarving up Oakland," said Terry Wiley, a former prosecutor who joined the Alameda office the same year as Ms. Harris.
Centrist Democrats, including President Bill Clinton and Joseph R. Biden Jr., who was a powerful senator of Delaware at the time, advanced tough-on-crime policies that flooded cities with police officers and that used incarceration to fight drug use. Black communities were devastated by the harsh sentences that were imposed on crack cocaine but that weren't applied to the powdered version of the drug favored by wealthier white people.
Ms. Harris traveled down the path of a new prosecutor -- first misdemeanors, then felony preliminary hearings, then felony trials.
She lived in Oakland, where the housing was still affordable, scooping up a one-bedroom condo near Lake Merritt for $ 116,000. She drove a Toyota Corolla and wore skirt suits in the time before pants were considered acceptable for women lawyers.
Her days, she recalled in her memoir, regularly included poring over autopsy photos with the coroner and trying to get survivors of rape to talk while they recovered at the county hospital.
A Splashy Debut in High Society
By early 1994, Ms. Harris entered San Francisco's society circles with a splash in the column of Herb Caen, the dapper and influential columnist for The Chronicle who was close friends with Willie Brown, then the speaker of the California State Assembly.
Appearing in Mr. Caen's column was the San Francisco version of a mention on Page Six of The New York Post, where Ms. Harris's future challenger for the White House, Donald Trump, was showing up regularly.
Mr. Caen's column that day in 1994 had an item about Mr. Brown's star-studded surprise birthday party -- Barbra Streisand and Clint Eastwood were in attendance -- at a Beverly Hills mansion.
Mr. Eastwood, Mr. Caen reported, ended up spilling champagne on "the Speaker's new steady, Kamala Harris, an Alameda Co. deputy D.A. who is something new in Willie's love life. She's a woman, not a girl. And she's black."
Mr. Brown was married, but he and his wife, Blanche Brown, had lived separate lives since the 1980s. The speaker liked to joke that his age plus the age of his girlfriend could not exceed 100. At the time, he was 60 and Ms. Harris was 29.
Ms. Harris was among several future political stars whose careers were propelled by Mr. Brown; that list included Gavin Newsom, now the California governor, and London Breed, the mayor of San Francisco. Mr. Brown appointed Ms. Harris to two state boards, and he gave her an expensive present: a BMW to drive to Sacramento for meetings.
Society columnists closely tracked Mr. Brown and Ms. Harris, commented on her fashion choices and referred to her as "stylish, slender, successful and very social."
The couple attended San Francisco Symphony galas and celebrated the wedding of Mr. Caen's son at Grace Cathedral and Mr. Brown's 61st birthday at a party where Ray Charles performed. They shot pool at Tosca, a legendary North Beach bar, during an episode of ABC's "Primetime Live," which profiled Mr. Brown, by then the mayor of San Francisco, and his flashy lifestyle. The couple traveled to Paris together and attended the Academy Awards.
While Mr. Brown may have given her entree into those spaces, Ms. Harris's charisma was a force of its own, several political contemporaries recalled.
Mark Leno, a former state senator from San Francisco, recalled meeting her at a mayoral campaign event for Mr. Brown in 1995 and being struck by her star power and easy banter.
"I thought, Who is this woman?" Mr. Leno said, adding that they became fast friends, dining regularly over Caesar salads at the city's popular Zuni Café.
Ms. Harris became a trustee of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, where she started a program to connect students with art mentors. Danny Glover, the "Lethal Weapon" actor and a San Francisco native, was the chairman of the new effort.
After Mr. Brown was elected mayor of San Francisco, Mr. Caen described Ms. Harris as "the new first-lady-in-waiting." Shortly after, though, Ms. Harris broke off the relationship when it became clear there was no real future with Mr. Brown, the former mayor has said.
Ms. Harris has excised Mr. Brown from her life story, never mentioning him in her two memoirs. She has bristled at the notion that he launched her career.
As she campaigned for district attorney eight years after breaking up with Mr. Brown, she told SF Weekly, "His career is over. I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years. I do not owe him a thing."
'My Original Gangsters'
In 1998, Ms. Harris left Alameda and became an assistant district attorney in San Francisco overseeing the career criminal unit under Terence Hallinan, the progressive district attorney known as "Kayo" for his earlier life as a boxer.
While San Francisco was regarded in prosecutor circles as less prestigious than Alameda, Ms. Harris saw a better opportunity there to seek the top job. There were too many good lawyers in Oakland with their eyes on running for office, said Nancy O'Malley, the former Alameda district attorney who oversaw Ms. Harris's work.
"When Kamala went over there she knew she was going to take him down," Ms. O'Malley said, referring to Mr. Hallinan. "She was assessing, frankly, the landscape everywhere to see where she could go to move up."
There, the two worlds she had been inhabiting -- courtrooms and high society -- came together, propelling her future political career.
In her first trial in San Francisco, a robbery case, Mr. Brown, who was still the mayor but no longer her boyfriend, dropped by the courtroom to watch Ms. Harris's closing arguments. "The jury was a bit taken aback by the mayor's presence in the otherwise empty spectator's gallery," one of the city's gossip columns noted.
Ms. Harris left in 2000 to work for the San Francisco city attorney, but she didn't stay away from the prosecutor's office for long.
When Ms. Harris decided in 2002 to run for district attorney against Mr. Hallinan, the bonds she had cultivated with political elites in San Francisco paid off. Few were more important than her relationship with Ms. Tompkins Buell, the founder of the clothing brands Esprit and The North Face, whose daughter, Summer Tompkins Walker, had befriended Ms. Harris through the city's social scene.
Ms. Tompkins Buell's husband, the real estate developer and Democratic Party mega-donor Mark Buell, agreed over cheeseburgers to become finance chairman for her campaign. He took the meeting as a courtesy but was quickly won over, Mr. Buell said in an interview.
He assembled a finance committee that included Vanessa Getty, the daughter-in-law of the oil tycoon Gordon Getty, and Susan Swig, the daughter of Richard Swig, the chairman of Fairmont Hotels. They paved the way for the who's who of San Francisco society to host receptions for Ms. Harris, each of which generated healthy sums of cash. (Ms. Harris spent thousands of dollars on flower bouquets to thank the hosts of the events, according to Jim Stearns, her campaign consultant in the D.A. race.)
Rising politicians often court the wealthy, but this group was particularly fruitful, given the kind of stratospheric wealth that the Bay Area would accumulate during the tech boom over the next two decades.
Ms. Harris entered the race polling at just 6 percent, but she wound up beating her former boss, Mr. Hallinan.
"No one thought you could upset a sitting D.A.," Mr. Buell said.
"It was really the beginning signs that when she puts her mind to something ... " he added, his voice trailing off.
That promise came full circle this summer.
It was July 2, 19 days before President Biden would end his re-election campaign and endorse her as the Democratic nominee. Ms. Harris stood before a small group of deep-pocketed, longtime friends at a private fund-raiser for the Biden-Harris ticket in San Francisco.
Joyce Newstat, a top Democratic Party fund-raiser, and her wife, Susan Lowenberg, a real estate executive, hosted about three dozen people for lunch at their condominium atop Nob Hill, with sweeping views of the bay. Ms. Harris seemed relaxed and happy to have traded Washington, D.C., for her former home of San Francisco, at least for a few hours.
She called those in the room -- including the Buells -- "my OGs" and then laughed as she explained that it meant original gangsters.
"The people in this room have been on this journey with me from the beginning," Ms. Harris told them. "I miss San Francisco. It all started here."

OAKLAND, Calif. — In August 1996, a jury in an Oakland, California, courtroom convicted a man of slicing off a portion of his girlfriend’s scalp. The prosecutor was Kamala Harris, and the gruesome case was one of the few that made news early in her career.
“It was a vicious crime,” Harris told The Oakland Tribune. She was in her seventh year as a rank-and-file prosecutor in Alameda County, doing battle with suspected drug lords and murderers in Oakland, which was still contending with the crack epidemic.
Weeks later, Harris was back in the news, this time across the bay in San Francisco as a boldface name in the society pages, among the young and fashionable who had gathered for a martini party at a Polo Ralph Lauren store before the Fall Antiques Show. It was hosted by a group of art lovers who called themselves the Young Collectors, raising money for underserved children while collecting “antiques, art, knowledge — and parties,” Pat Steger, The San Francisco Chronicle’s society editor and columnist, wrote.
During these formative years, when Harris was in her 20s and 30s, her life ran along two tracks that proved pivotal to her political ascendancy. By day, she developed the courtroom skills that have shaped her methodical approach as a candidate. By night, she moved through San Francisco high society, nurturing the financial and political connections that became instrumental in her national rise.
Harris, who grew up in a modest neighborhood in Berkeley, California, with a single mother, showed a talent for forging relationships with some of California’s most influential elites while she was still a young prosecutor.
She dated Willie Brown, one of the most powerful legislators in state history who became mayor of San Francisco. She cultivated relationships with Susie Tompkins Buell, the founder of two iconic clothing brands, and Laurene Powell Jobs, a businessperson who was married to Steve Jobs, the entrepreneur who made Apple a tech powerhouse.
“The ability to have people want to open up to you is not that different in a courtroom than it is in a cocktail party,” said Teresa Drenick, who worked with Harris as a prosecutor in the 1990s.
The Gritty Streets of 1990s Oakland
The Alameda County district attorney’s office was for decades known as a place for ambitious lawyers to cut their teeth. When Harris arrived, Oakland was struggling at the tail end of the crack epidemic, and the war on drugs was in full force and homicides were at near record levels.
“When I was coming out of law school and you wanted to be a DA, you wanted to be either in Alameda County or Manhattan,” Drenick said. “Those were the golden rings of DA offices at the time.”
A few years before Harris joined the office, Felix Mitchell, an infamous drug lord in Oakland whose career was an inspiration for the movie “New Jack City,” had been arrested by the FBI and later stabbed to death in prison. That led to a leadership vacuum on the streets, as new drug bosses violently competed for territory.
“The Oakland that me and Kamala came into was an Oakland where his top lieutenants and new players in the game were recarving up Oakland,” said Terry Wiley, a former prosecutor who joined the Alameda office the same year as Harris.
Centrist Democrats, including President Bill Clinton and Joe Biden, who was a powerful senator of Delaware at the time, advanced tough-on-crime policies that flooded cities with police officers and that used incarceration to fight drug use. Black communities were devastated by the harsh sentences that were imposed on crack cocaine but that weren’t applied to the powdered version of the drug favored by wealthier white people.
Harris traveled down the path of a new prosecutor — first misdemeanors, then felony preliminary hearings, then felony trials.
She lived in Oakland, where housing was still affordable, scooping up a one-bedroom condo near Lake Merritt for $116,000. She drove a Toyota Corolla and wore skirt suits in the time before pants were considered acceptable for women lawyers.
Her days, she recalled in her memoir, regularly included poring over autopsy photos with the coroner and trying to get survivors of rape to talk while they recovered at the county hospital.
A Splashy Debut in High Society
By early 1994, Harris entered San Francisco’s society circles with a splash in the column of Herb Caen, the dapper and influential columnist for The Chronicle who was close friends with Brown, then the speaker of the California State Assembly.
Appearing in Caen’s column was the San Francisco version of a mention on Page Six of The New York Post, where Harris’ future challenger for the White House, Donald Trump, was showing up regularly.
Caen’s column that day in 1994 had an item about Brown’s star-studded surprise birthday party — Barbra Streisand and Clint Eastwood were in attendance — at a Beverly Hills mansion.
Eastwood, Caen reported, ended up spilling Champagne on “the Speaker’s new steady, Kamala Harris, an Alameda Co. deputy DA who is something new in Willie’s love life. She’s a woman, not a girl. And she’s black.”
Brown was married, but he and his wife, Blanche Brown, had lived separate lives since the 1980s. The speaker liked to joke that his age plus the age of his girlfriend could not exceed 100. At the time, he was 60 and Harris was 29.
Harris was among several future political stars whose careers were propelled by Brown; that list included Gavin Newsom, now the California governor, and London Breed, the mayor of San Francisco. Brown appointed Harris to two state boards, and he gave her an expensive present: a BMW to drive to Sacramento for meetings.
Society columnists closely tracked Brown and Harris, commented on her fashion choices and referred to her as “stylish, slender, successful and very social.”
The couple attended San Francisco Symphony galas and celebrated the wedding of Caen’s son at Grace Cathedral and Brown’s 61st birthday at a party where Ray Charles performed. They shot pool at Tosca, a legendary North Beach bar, during an episode of ABC’s “Primetime Live,” which profiled Brown, by then the mayor of San Francisco, and his flashy lifestyle. The couple traveled to Paris together and attended the Academy Awards.
While Brown may have given her entree into those spaces, Harris’ charisma was a force of its own, several political contemporaries recalled.
Mark Leno, a former state senator from San Francisco, recalled meeting her at a mayoral campaign event for Brown in 1995 and being struck by her star power and easy banter.
“I thought, Who is this woman?” Leno said, adding that they became fast friends, dining regularly over Caesar salads at the city’s popular Zuni Café.
Harris became a trustee of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, where she started a program to connect students with art mentors. Danny Glover, the “Lethal Weapon” actor and a San Francisco native, was the chair of the new effort.
After Brown was elected mayor of San Francisco, Caen described Harris as “the new first-lady-in-waiting.” Shortly after, though, Harris broke off the relationship when it became clear there was no real future with Brown, the former mayor has said.
Harris has excised Brown from her life story, never mentioning him in her two memoirs. She has bristled at the notion that he launched her career.
As she campaigned for district attorney eight years after breaking up with Brown, she told SF Weekly, “His career is over. I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years. I do not owe him a thing.”
‘My Original Gangsters’
In 1998, Harris left Alameda and became an assistant district attorney in San Francisco overseeing the career criminal unit under Terence Hallinan, the progressive district attorney known as “Kayo” for his earlier life as a boxer.
While San Francisco was regarded in prosecutor circles as less prestigious than Alameda, Harris saw a better opportunity there to seek the top job. There were too many good lawyers in Oakland with their eyes on running for office, said Nancy O’Malley, the former Alameda district attorney who oversaw Harris’ work.
“When Kamala went over there she knew she was going to take him down,” O’Malley said, referring to Hallinan. “She was assessing, frankly, the landscape everywhere to see where she could go to move up.”
There, the two worlds she had been inhabiting — courtrooms and high society — came together, propelling her future political career.
In her first trial in San Francisco, a robbery case, Brown, who was still the mayor but no longer her boyfriend, dropped by the courtroom to watch Harris’ closing arguments. “The jury was a bit taken aback by the mayor’s presence in the otherwise empty spectator’s gallery,” one of the city’s gossip columns noted.
Harris left in 2000 to work for the San Francisco city attorney, but she didn’t stay away from the prosecutor’s office for long.
When Harris decided in 2002 to run for district attorney against Hallinan, the bonds she had cultivated with political elites in San Francisco paid off. Few were more important than her relationship with Tompkins Buell, the founder of the clothing brands Esprit and The North Face, whose daughter, Summer Tompkins Walker, had befriended Harris through the city’s social scene.
Tompkins Buell’s husband, real estate developer and Democratic Party megadonor Mark Buell, agreed over cheeseburgers to become finance chair for her campaign. He took the meeting as a courtesy but was quickly won over, Buell said in an interview.
He assembled a finance committee that included Vanessa Getty, the daughter-in-law of oil tycoon Gordon Getty, and Susan Swig, the daughter of Richard Swig, the chair of Fairmont Hotels. They paved the way for the who’s who of San Francisco society to host receptions for Harris, each of which generated healthy sums of cash. (Harris spent thousands of dollars on flower bouquets to thank the hosts of the events, according to Jim Stearns, her campaign consultant in the DA race.)
Rising politicians often court the wealthy, but this group was particularly fruitful, given the kind of stratospheric wealth that the Bay Area would accumulate during the tech boom over the next two decades.
Harris entered the race polling at just 6%, but she wound up beating her former boss, Hallinan.
“No one thought you could upset a sitting DA,” Buell said.
“It was really the beginning signs that when she puts her mind to something … ” he added, his voice trailing off.
That promise came full circle this summer.
It was July 2, 19 days before President Joe Biden would end his reelection campaign and endorse her as the Democratic nominee. Harris stood before a small group of deep-pocketed, longtime friends at a private fundraiser for the Biden-Harris ticket in San Francisco.
Joyce Newstat, a top Democratic Party fundraiser, and her wife, Susan Lowenberg, a real estate executive, hosted about three dozen people for lunch at their condominium atop Nob Hill, with sweeping views of the bay. Harris seemed relaxed and happy to have traded Washington, D.C., for her former home of San Francisco, at least for a few hours.
She called those in the room — including the Buells — “my OGs” and then laughed as she explained that it meant original gangsters.
“The people in this room have been on this journey with me from the beginning,” Harris told them. “I miss San Francisco. It all started here.”

Harris and Democrats Lose Their Reluctance to Call Trump a Fascist

The word “fascist” has hovered around former President Donald Trump from the moment he rode down his golden escalator in 2015 to warn of Mexican rapists and drug dealers in the memorable opening of his bid for president. But for most top Democrats, it was a provocative term loaded with dread, historical import and potential incitement — best left unsaid.
Until Vice President Kamala Harris this week made clear — again and again — that it would be just fine with her to use the word.
On Tuesday, as radio host Charlamagne Tha God interviewed Harris, he interjected as the vice president contrasted her vision with her rival’s. “The other is about fascism,” he said of Trump’s vision. “Why can’t we just say it?”
Harris’ response: “Yes, we can say that.”
On Wednesday, speaking in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, Harris quoted Gen. Mark Milley, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump, describing his former boss as “fascist to the core,” as detailed in a new book from journalist Bob Woodward.
“America,” she said, “must heed this warning.”
The quotation of Milley may have opened the floodgates for Democrats, granting new permission with the authority of his uniform and his unique closeness to the inner workings of Trump’s administration. But an element of political risk remains, even as Trump freely uses the word himself against Harris.
For years now, Democrats have avoided calling Trump a fascist in part out of fear of alienating his followers, said Timothy Snyder, a Yale historian of Central Europe and the Holocaust. For one thing, Democrats did not want a repeat of Hillary Clinton’s dismissal of Trump supporters as “a basket of deplorables.”
Even President Joe Biden, who has made Trump’s threat to democracy central to his case against the former president for years, only inched up to the term when in 2022 he spoke of “the entire philosophy” of Trump’s movement: “I’m going to say something, it’s like semifascism.”
But as Trump steers his rhetoric toward nativism, racial resentment and overt threats against his political enemies, reticence has fallen away.
“You have people like General Milley, who are telling voters that Donald Trump will usher in an era of fascist America,” said Paul D. Eaton, a retired major general and leader of the liberal veterans group VoteVets. “In so many countries throughout history, we have seen fascism take hold only because the voters enabled it to take hold.”
Liz Cheney, a former Republican member of Congress and staunch opponent of Trump, said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that she had great respect for Milley and that “I see no reason to disagree with that assessment.”
Clinton, Trump’s opponent in 2016, chimed in Monday in a social media post: “Trump’s rhetoric has become blatantly fascist.”
All of that has come after Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, singled out the term “fascist” as an incitement to violence that was beyond the pale.
“Vance is a very smart guy,” said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor at New York University whose recent book, “Strongmen,” looked at autocrats and fascists from Benito Mussolini to Trump. “He knows the power of the word.”
Historians, political scientists and linguists have wrestled with the term ever since Mussolini used it to describe his form of authoritarianism, in paradoxical terms, as a “revolution of reaction.” Robert O. Paxton, a political scientist and historian at Columbia University specializing in Vichy France, defined fascism as political behavior “marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation or victimhood,” with “cults” of nationalist purity. “In uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites,” he said, fascism “abandons democratic liberties.”
But its inexorable tie to the wholesale destruction of Europe during World War II, and to the murder of 6 million Jews, has made the casual connection of fascism to contemporary politics all but forbidden to serious politicians — until now.
“The most important thing one can say about Trump and fascism is that Trump is a fascist,” Snyder said.
The definitions of fascism, however, have never been completely fixed, as each new generation’s authoritarians vary their forms and methods of control.
Peter Hayes, a historian at Northwestern University who has studied the rise of Nazism extensively, pointed to commonalities in regimes and movements typically described as “fascist”: a militarization of politics, through violent militias, misogyny, hypermasculinity, intense nationalism, calls for economic self-sufficiency, and a scapegoating of groups separate from an aggrieved core of followers.
In the late 1960s, the term reemerged as an all-purpose epithet, hurled by the left at anything or anyone deemed dull or establishment.
“We’ve always been too ready to use it, like the boy who cried wolf,” Hayes said.
But Trump’s calls for mass deportations and internment camps, his promise to use force against a pernicious “enemy from within,” his leveraging of a cult of personality, his refusal to distance himself from groups like the Proud Boys and Three Percenters, and his persistent evocation and even glorification of violence have given Hayes real misgivings.
“I don’t think we’re hyperventilating here,” he said. “This is a guy very much telling us what he wants to do.”
Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, who served Trump at the Department of Homeland Security, said Tuesday night at the University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics that Trump would almost surely pursue mass deportations if he wins in November, since they were central to his campaign. While recent surveys suggest the proposal may be popular now — 57% of likely voters said they would support deporting immigrants living in the United States illegally back to their home countries, according to the latest national New York Times/Siena College poll — Cuccinelli posited that the program would quickly lose support as Americans saw the faces and families of those deported, and the turmoil the effort would create.
But, he added, because Trump would not be standing for another election, he would not be swayed by public opinion.
Still, Trump has shown sensitivity to any association with fascism. In 2022, he sued CNN for $475 million, saying the network’s allusions to the “Big Lie” — his assertion, still repeated daily, that he won the 2020 election — amounted to a “highly defamatory and persistent association of the Plaintiff to Hitler.” Cited in the suit: assertions by anchor Jake Tapper; a piece by a former political columnist, Chris Cillizza; and an opinion article by Ben-Ghiat. (The suit was dismissed last year.)
The conservative Washington Examiner noted that Democrats had been calling Republicans “fascist” since Barry Goldwater’s campaign in 1964. Richard Nixon’s election marked a rising “fascist tide.” Mild-mannered Gerald Ford, of all people, was harassed as a “fascist pig.” After Democratic officials at their 2012 convention compared Republican rhetoric to Nazi propaganda, Norm Coleman, a former Minnesota senator and ally of Republican nominee Mitt Romney, demanded that then-President Barack Obama stop his party from “trivializing Nazism.”
“Fascism is anything Democrats don’t like,” the Washington Examiner wrote in August.
Tom Eddy, the chair of the Republican Party in Erie County, Pennsylvania, said he was recently called a fascist by a mask-wearing activist on the streets of Erie, where he was with an elderly friend.
“I said, ‘Do you even know what it means?’” Eddy recalled. “He said, ‘Don’t need to know. I know what you are.’ And he was threatening my 70-year-old friend, you know? Well, that didn’t last long.” He added, “I have a temper.”
That question — “Do you even know what it means?” — is key in the debate. Laura Thornton, whose McCain Institute was founded to honor Republican Sen. John McCain, argued that Republicans are as apt to use the term as Democrats, especially Trump.
“Every time the radical left, Democrats, Marxists, communists and fascists indict me, I considered it a great badge of honor,” Trump said in February, and not for the last time.
In a statement, his campaign spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, contended that Harris was “insulting the intelligence of more than half the country by insinuating that they would support a fascist candidate.”
Steven Cheung, Trump’s communications director, went further. “There have been two heinous assassination attempts on President Trump’s life, and their violent rhetoric is directly to blame,” he said in a statement.
Trump has called Harris “fascist” on numerous occasions.
Republicans have used fascism as a rubric for the limiting of certain kinds of speech on social media, the imposition of mask and vaccine mandates, and the legal cases against Trump.
Such efforts may be considered government overreach, Thornton said, but they are not fascism.
Ben-Ghiat drew clear distinctions between Trump’s movement and classical fascism, which was almost always expansionist in foreign policy ambition, made use of organized paramilitary forces and implemented one-party states, often after provocations like the burning of the Reichstag in 1933.
But Snyder ticked off his own touchstones of fascism, all of which he says are present in Trump’s movement: a government framed around the choosing of its enemies more than the helping of its citizens; the honoring not of an office but of a “capital-L leader,” and the building of a cult around him; and the creation of a Big Lie.
Trump has used dehumanizing terms for his opponents, real or imagined, like “vermin.” He also has a love of aesthetics and spectacle that hark back to Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl, Ben-Ghiat said.
He certainly has a cult of personality behind him, Thornton said, but that developed largely on its own, she argued, reflecting the demand for a strongman within elements of the population more than any effort by Trump to inculcate it.
“If you are tattooing the face of a politician on your body, that is not a normal relationship with a political leader,” she said.
Still, there is a reason the term “fascist” is in such wide circulation as Trump amps up a campaign increasingly built around nativism, racial resentment, fear and threats, Ben-Ghiat said.
“It’s a measure of the urgency and sense of emergency that Hillary Clinton and Mark Milley are using this word,” she said. “It packs a punch.”

Trump Escalates Threats to Political Opponents He Deems the ‘Enemy’

With three weeks left before Election Day, former President Donald Trump is pushing to the forefront of his campaign a menacing political threat: that he would use the power of the presidency to crush those who disagree with him.
In a Fox News interview Sunday, Trump framed Democrats as a pernicious “enemy from within” that would cause chaos on Election Day that he speculated the National Guard might need to handle.
A day later, he closed his remarks to a crowd at what was billed as a town hall in Pennsylvania with a stark message about his political opponents.
“They are so bad and frankly, they’re evil,” Trump said. “They’re evil. What they’ve done, they’ve weaponized, they’ve weaponized our elections. They’ve done things that nobody thought was even possible.”
And on Tuesday, he once again refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power when pressed by an interviewer at an economic forum in Chicago.
With early voting underway in key battlegrounds, the race for the White House is moving toward Election Day in an extraordinary and sobering fashion. Trump has long flirted with, if not openly endorsed, anti-democratic tendencies with his continued refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election, embrace of conspiracy theories of large-scale voter fraud and accusations that the justice system is being weaponized against him. He has praised leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for being authoritarian strongmen.
But never before has a presidential nominee — let alone a former president — openly suggested turning the military on U.S. citizens simply because they oppose his candidacy. As he escalates his threats of political retribution, Trump is offering voters the choice of a very different, and far less democratic, form of American government.
“There is not a case in American history where a presidential candidate has run for office on a promise that they would exact retribution against anyone they perceive as not supporting them in the campaign,” said Ian Bassin, a former associate White House counsel under Barack Obama who leads the advocacy group Protect Democracy. “It’s so fundamentally, outrageously beyond the pale of how this country has worked that it’s hard to articulate how insane it is.”
As they move into what will be their closing arguments to voters, Trump and Harris are devoting most of their attention to wrangling over the issues that remain voters’ top priorities — the economy, abortion rights, housing costs, and American engagement in the wars roiling Ukraine and the Middle East. The race remains tight, with views about Trump deeply cemented for most voters.
But the Harris campaign sees fresh political opportunities in Trump’s latest attacks on democratic principles, particularly among moderate Republicans and independents who disapprove of the former president’s character and polarizing style.
As Trump spoke Monday night, Harris stood in a stadium at the opposite end of Pennsylvania where she took the unusual step of playing an extended video montage of Trump vowing to go after those who oppose him. It included his recent comments about the possibility of military action against the “enemy within.”
“He’s talking about, he considers anyone who doesn’t support him or will not bend to his will an enemy of our country,” she told several thousand supporters at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania. “He is saying that he would use the military to go after them.”
Harris’ full-throated attacks on Trump are a notable break from her previous efforts to minimize him as a vestige of the past. Her aides believe voters are still not familiar with Trump’s statements, nor do they fully understand the stakes for American democracy.
The campaign plans to integrate the video of Trump’s remarks — which it quickly turned into a television ad — into future rallies. Harris told aides after Monday night’s event that using the video footage to make her case against Trump reminded her of presenting evidence at trial.
Some who have publicly opposed Trump’s return to power are preparing for him to keep his promises. Gen. Mark Milley, who served as chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during Trump’s administration, told journalist Bob Woodward that he feared being recalled to uniform to be court-martialed “for disloyalty” should Trump win reelection. After criticizing Trump in a pointed retirement speech, Milley told Woodward that he installed bulletproof glass and blastproof curtains at his home.
Olivia Troye, who was Vice President Mike Pence’s homeland security adviser before becoming a prominent surrogate for the Harris campaign, said in an interview that her fears about a second Trump administration included prosecutions and a possible threat to her family’s physical security.
She worries that her husband could lose his job, and that Trump could pardon Jan. 6 rioters and they could target her. She even paused plans to adopt a child because she fears the environment for her family has become too dangerous.
“I have certainly considered what my options are in terms of citizenship in other places,” she said. “We are preparing for the worst-case scenario.”
Such threats of vengeance from Trump are hardly new: He has been talking about punishing his political adversaries since his 2016 run, when he repeatedly insisted that his opponent, Hillary Clinton, should go to jail and he encouraged crowds to chant “lock her up” at his rallies. Since his defeat in 2020, he has refused to accept that result, continuing to peddle false claims about election fraud.
And he has woven vows of retribution throughout his third campaign, promising to avenge what he sees as his wronged supporters.
“In 2016, I declared, ‘I am your voice,’” Trump told a crowd of conservative activists in March 2023. “Today, I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.”
He toned down his rhetoric for a brief period before winning the Iowa caucuses in a landslide. But he quickly revived threats for revenge prosecutions and other retaliatory measures after being convicted of 34 felony counts by a New York jury in late May, saying, “Sometimes revenge can be justified.” In June, he took another tack: “My retribution will be success.”
Trump’s advisers would prefer that he focused on the economy and immigration, believing these issues will give him the edge with undecided voters who may be otherwise turned off by his menacing message.
But even in ostensibly policy-focused speeches or in town halls where he is meant to directly respond to voter concerns around pocketbook issues or public safety, Trump tends to return to the same grievances that have animated his political campaign this year.
At rallies, he has tried to volley Democrats’ attacks back at them, accusing President Joe Biden of being a threat to democracy when he was still the nominee, and then suggesting Harris had orchestrated a “coup” when she replaced Biden on the ticket. At his town hall on Monday, Trump — whose vehement election denialism spurred some of his supporters to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and disrupt the peaceful transfer of power — argued that Biden’s exit from the race amounted to the “overthrow of an American president.”
Trump treated the Jan. 6 riot as largely a harmless protest, downplaying the size of the mob of his supporters and their violent intent.
“You had a peaceful transfer of power,” Trump said, citing Inauguration Day, when he “left the morning that I was supposed to leave,” as proof of “a very peaceful transfer.”
Notably, many of the business and civic leaders seated in the ballroom in Chicago applauded. And there are signs that voters and even some prominent elected officials simply do not believe that Trump will make good on his most alarming threats.
When Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, was asked about Trump’s “enemy within” remarks during an interview with the CNN host Jake Tapper on Monday, he argued that the former president was referring to immigrants who entered the country illegally.
After being asked about Trump’s suggestion of turning the military against Americans, Youngkin replied that he didn’t believe that was what the president was saying. The network, he said, was “misinterpreting and misrepresenting his thoughts.”
"I’m literally reading his quotes to you,” Tapper replied.

Trump’s Border Plans Are Light on Details but Strong on Fury

WASHINGTON — During a rally in Arizona on Sunday, former President Donald Trump left out a crucial detail when promoting his proposal to hire 10,000 new agents to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border.
He did not say where these legions of new agents would come from.
Given its longtime struggles with recruitment, it would take the U.S. Border Patrol years to ramp up hiring to that extent, if it ever could.
But that was just one of several aggressive moves he said would be coming to protect the border if he is elected. He pledged mass deportations, but it is unclear whether he could harness the resources to round up millions of immigrants. He proposed funneling some of the military’s budget toward border security, though he did not say how he would get the courts to sign off on that.
Trump’s plans as outlined Sunday were the latest reminder that when it comes to the former president’s vision for border security, hyperbolic rhetoric, rather than substantive solutions, often wins out.
Many politicians announce ambitious, if unrealistic, policies on the campaign trail to energize their base that are scant on implementation details. But Trump has centered much of his campaign on such proposals, pitching a staggering array of tax breaks without discussing how he might pay for them and promising an immediate end to conflicts in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip but providing scant details on how.
He is running that playbook again as he seizes on the issue of illegal border crossings, which rose to record levels under the Biden administration, to attack Vice President Kamala Harris.
Trump has tried to blame her for the millions of migrant crossings in recent years, even though President Joe Biden assigned her a role that was not responsible for managing the policies specific to the U.S.-Mexico border. Harris was rather in charge of addressing the poverty and corruption in Central America to discourage migrants from traveling north to the United States.
“They’re destroying our country,” Trump said Sunday of the Biden administration’s immigration policies. He said Harris had “ruined the jobs of a lot of these agents.”
Yet Trump’s own announced plans to deal with border security at times seem focused more on tough-sounding policies — intended to tap into anger and fear about immigration — than sweating out the details of workable solutions.
Case in point: Trump’s pronouncement to bring in 10,000 new Border Patrol agents. While aggressive and sweeping, like much of Trump’s immigration agenda, the proposal would face extraordinary challenges on implementation.
“We were about 1,200 down when I was there, and we still had a great deal of difficulty filling the existing slots,” said Gil Kerlikowske, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection during the Obama administration. “The 10,000 would be really a difficult number.”
The agency, with more than 19,000 agents, has struggled to hire officers in recent years because of morale issues, the pandemic and congressional dysfunction that made funding unpredictable, according to the Government Accountability Office. Trump also said he would ask Congress to immediately approve a 10% raise for agents and a $10,000 retention and signing bonus.
The Trump campaign did not answer questions about how it would follow through on the plan to hire thousands of agents.
In a much harsher position, Trump said he would pursue a historic deportation operation. He proposes invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expel suspected members of drug cartels and criminal gangs without due process.
That law allows for summary deportation of people from countries with which the United States is at war, that have invaded the United States or that have engaged in “predatory incursions.” While the Supreme Court has upheld past uses of the law, it is not clear whether the justices would allow a president to stretch it to encompass drug cartel activity. The text of the law requires a link to the actions of a foreign government.
Still, Trump raises the specter of roundups, which he said would be made possible by transferring other federal officers and deputizing local law enforcement to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some cities, however, refuse to collaborate with ICE out of concern such cooperation would lead to deportations for minor offenses.
When Trump was last in the White House, sweeping deportation operations were unsuccessful. That was in part because ICE lacks enough agents or detention capacity for such an operation.
This time, Trump has said, he would use money in the military budget to build giant detention facilities for such deportation missions. But a similar strategy to use Pentagon funds to build his border wall during his last time in office was blocked by the courts in 2020.
Still, these campaign flourishes are not necessarily aimed at passing logistical tests. They are aimed at winning over voters. Trump used a similar strategy during the 2016 presidential election, when promising repeatedly to build a border wall and have Mexico pay for it. American taxpayers ended up paying the bill.
Despite the logistical, legal and financial challenges Trump faces as he seeks to implement his immigration proposals, polling shows many voters trust Trump to handle the border over Biden and Harris.
The Harris campaign has tried to cut into those numbers by spotlighting the vice president’s record as a prosecutor in a border state and by challenging the legitimacy of Trump’s proposals.
“Trump doesn’t care about solving problems — he only wants to run on one,” said Matt Corridoni, a Harris campaign spokesperson.
Democrats note that while Trump proposed a surge in hiring for Border Patrol agents Sunday, he helped block an effort this year to hire 1,500 officials to the parent agency of the Border Patrol.
A Senate border bill negotiated by the White House, Democrats and Senate Republicans would have provided the funding to hire border officials, as well as thousands of asylum officers.
Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, said Trump opposed that bill because it “would have expedited the illegal entry of thousands of illegal immigrants into the country every week.”
The package actually would have toughened an initial asylum screening for migrants, making it far more difficult for them to stay in the country. It was endorsed by the National Border Patrol Council, the union for Border Patrol agents, which endorsed Trump during his rally Sunday.
But taking a cue from Trump, Republicans tanked the bill to prevent Democrats from securing an election-year victory. Harris has said she would sign the bill once elected, if it is reintroduced and passed.
Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who led the negotiations on the package, said this year that Republicans chose not to support it to give Trump a political edge on the border.
“It got stirred up in all the presidential politics, and several of my colleagues starting looking for ways” to back away from the bill “after President Trump said, ‘Don’t fix anything during the presidential election,’” Lankford told Fox News in April.
Still, Lankford stressed the need to prioritize realistic solutions to the border.
“He’s got an office that he’s running for. He’s got a campaign that he’s running,” Lankford said of Trump. “I’m already in office. I’ve got a responsibility to be able to carry on this.”

Expanding the N.F.L.'s Financial Field of Play: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Under the expansionist leadership of its commissioner, the National Football League is growing richer and richer. So, too, is Mr. Goodell.
As they met in the lobby of the Omni Viking Lakes Hotel in Minnesota in late August, Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, and Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, greeted each other warmly, sharing fist bumps as a small entourage that included their oldest sons surrounded them.
"Boy, you're looking trim," Mr. Jones, wearing a light blue jacket with a diamond star pin on his lapel, told Mr. Kraft, wearing his signature Nike dress sneakers. The two men, who have nine Super Bowl wins between them (six for Mr. Kraft, 83, and three for Mr. Jones, who turns 82 on Sunday), were upbeat and refreshed after their summer vacations in the South of France and the Hamptons.
Soon they were joined in the lobby by other N.F.L. royalty: the Kansas City Chiefs owner, Clark Hunt; the Pittsburgh Steelers owner, Art Rooney II; and, most significant, Roger Goodell, the league commissioner. There were smiles all around -- and for good reason.
Over the next three hours, Mr. Goodell, 65, would preside over yet another decision that would make these already extremely wealthy individuals even richer: The league's owners voted 31 to 1 to allow teams to sell up to 10 percent of their multibillion-dollar clubs to private equity groups.
Afterward, as other owners slipped into their waiting limousines, Mr. Jones, the most ardent proponent of growing the league, said to a gaggle of waiting reporters: "This is good for anybody that's in love with the N.F.L., any part of it -- the game part, on the field, off the field. This is a good thing."
The N.B.A., the N.H.L. and Major League Baseball tapped private equity money years ago. But the N.F.L. is the largest league with the best long-term prospects, which is why firms like Arctos Partners, Sixth Street Partners and others have been eager to bid for stakes in the Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins and other clubs. By year's end, owners of N.F.L. teams, worth on average $ 6.5 billion, may get nine-figure checks to help pay for new stadiums, buy out partners or retire debt.
The private equity move is the latest financial milestone in Mr. Goodell's 18-year stewardship of the N.F.L. The son of a politician, he has spent his entire career in the league, starting as an intern after college, then climbing the ladder by tackling an array of jobs, including overseeing its international expansion and strong-arming cities to subsidize stadiums. By the time Mr. Goodell was elected commissioner in 2006, succeeding Paul Tagliabue, he was well aware that Mr. Jones, Mr. Kraft and other owners who had paid nine and 10 figures for their teams wanted faster returns on their investments.
Mr. Goodell has been the man to make sure that happens, with a series of aggressive moves over the past two decades that have made the N.F.L. the wealthiest sports league in the world.
While its financial prowess has been lauded in sports business circles, some of its growth has come at the expense of the players who have to play expanded schedules with less recovery time and a greater risk of injury. Fans, too, are having to shell out more to attend games or watch their favorite sport on television, with streaming services like Amazon, Peacock and Netflix showing more N.F.L. games -- including playoff contests -- that used to be the sole province of network TV and basic cable.
"They're doing what other leagues are doing, but from the highest mountaintop in the industry," said Robert Boland, a former N.F.L. agent who teaches sports law at Seton Hall University. "The big leagues are all moving away from a live product consumed by everyday men and women, but because the N.F.L. was so available for so long, there's some pain attached to this."
An Audacious Target
In 2010, at the league's annual meeting at the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes, in Florida, Mr. Goodell and his chief financial officer, Anthony Noto, unveiled an audacious target: The N.F.L. would hit $ 25 billion in revenue by 2027. The league generated about $ 8 billion at the time, double the amount it had 17 years earlier. Now, Mr. Goodell wanted to more than triple its revenue in the next 17 years. Owners and executives in the room shared sideways glances.
The N.F.L. was the country's most lucrative league, but it was facing headwinds from a deep recession and a labor deal that the owners felt had given the players too big a share of the revenue. The owners were optimistic by nature, but not that optimistic.
"You know, Roger always speaks confidently, and him saying it not all that far into his reign as commissioner, I have to admit, it was quite a statement," said Steve Underwood, a former Tennessee Titans general counsel, who attended the meeting. "I didn't see how he could achieve that, to be deadly blunt."
With the league now in its 105th season, Mr. Goodell's goal is no longer an ambitious dream; it's becoming a reality. The league has grown by about $ 1 billion a year since 2010 and now generates more than $ 20 billion in annual revenue.
In 2021, the league signed media rights contracts -- its largest source of revenue -- worth more than $ 110 billion, about twice the amount of prior deals. CBS, Fox and NBC agreed to pay more than $ 2 billion annually to hold on to their slots to broadcast games. And ESPN is shelling out about $ 2.7 billion a year to continue airing "Monday Night Football," and to be added into the rotation to broadcast the Super Bowl beginning in 2026.
In 2020, the owners persuaded the players to accept an additional 17th regular-season game, and in 2021, they added extra playoff games, changes that increased revenue even more. In April, at the N.F.L. draft in Detroit, Mr. Goodell floated the idea of an 18th regular-season game, a contentious proposal that would extend the season to Presidents' Day weekend in late February. Revenue has also poured in from new stadiums in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond.
"I thought the target was aggressive but, to be honest, achievable," Mr. Kraft said, referring to the commissioner's goal of achieving $ 25 billion in revenue by 2027. "I'm proud of Roger for putting it on the table to motivate everyone in the league office and the business management of teams that we all had to pull it together and try and make that happen."
As the league has prospered, so has Mr. Goodell: About 90 percent of the commissioner's compensation is tied to a basket of metrics and incentives. After securing lucrative labor and broadcast deals and steering the league through the Covid-19 pandemic without missing a game, he received $ 63,900,050 in each of the fiscal years running from April 2019 to March 2020 and April 2020 to March 2021, making him one of the highest-paid executives in the country. In October, Mr. Goodell signed an extension that will keep him atop the league through March 2027, when he will be 68. (Mr. Goodell declined to be interviewed for this article.)
An Unstoppable Juggernaut
One of Mr. Goodell's other big jobs is to shield the owners from controversies. In 2014, he was widely criticized for his two-game suspension of the Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice after video showed him dragging his fiancée out of a hotel elevator. The criticism turned into a national uproar when a subsequent video showed Mr. Rice knocking her unconscious. (Mr. Goodell suspended Mr. Rice indefinitely after the release of the second video. An arbitrator nullified that decision, saying Mr. Rice could not be penalized twice for the same offense.)
Three years later, the commissioner was chastised -- including by President Donald J. Trump -- for his handling of protests by dozens of players who knelt during the playing of the national anthem to draw attention to police brutality and social injustice.
But Mr. Goodell has emerged from those and other controversies with the support of ownership primarily for one reason: He keeps making them money.
Last year, 93 of the top 100 programs on television were N.F.L. games. The number of N.F.L. fans has increased to about 210 million, up from 170 million about a decade ago, according to figures supplied by the league. But the N.F.L. has grown in part because Mr. Goodell and the owners take small, careful steps, not bold leaps. The new private equity investment rules fit that pattern.
The owners began discussing accepting private equity in 2019 but chose to watch how other leagues handled the process first. The N.F.L. wanted to preserve its governance structure, which relies heavily on owners to make most key decisions affecting the league. The owners were also wary of diluting the control of the multigenerational families that own the Chicago Bears, the New York Giants, the Steelers and other teams.
Most of those families have their wealth wrapped up in their teams and lack the cash to build splashy stadiums. As the value of teams has soared -- the Washington Commanders fetched a record $ 6 billion in 2023, despite having a 32-49-1 record the previous five years -- they have found it harder to attract bidders with pockets deep enough to buy minority stakes that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
Private equity firms have access to billions of dollars and have been eager investors in the sports world. But they have a reputation for slashing costs at companies they acquire and flipping them for a quick profit, potential turmoil the N.F.L. owners want to avoid.
So last year, Mr. Goodell created a committee that included Mr. Hunt, Mr. Kraft, the Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, the Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, the Denver Broncos chief executive Greg Penner and the Commanders owner Josh Harris to design rules so teams could tap private equity money while keeping the firms at arms length.
At a meeting in August, the league's owners approved investment by four private equity groups. Three of them -- Arctos, Sixth Street and Ares Management -- can invest in no more than six teams at a time. The fourth group, a consortium that includes Blackstone and the Carlyle Group, can invest in up to 12 teams.
"We tried to talk to people who we think are in the know, and I think we were patient on this," Mr. Goodell said to reporters after the meeting. "We hope by taking what we think are the blue-chip firms that this will be a successful approach for everyone at the N.F.L., the investors and the firms. So we think we found the right model."
An 18th Game
Soon after having back surgery, Mr. Goodell flew to Detroit in April to host the draft, where players have traditionally walked onstage after being selected by a team and bear-hugged the commissioner. (Players were told to avoid doing so this year, but at least one, JC Latham, ignored the directive.)
The draft is an example of how Mr. Goodell has maximized the N.F.L.'s popularity. In 2015, the league moved the three-day event out of New York City, its longtime home, to Chicago, Nashville, Las Vegas and elsewhere, drawing larger crowds each year, including a record 750,000 fans in Detroit.
During the draft, Mr. Goodell said in an interview on ESPN that he favored adding an extra regular-season game. The owners have long craved an 18th game because it would mean more ticket revenue and money from broadcasters. But the league needs the players to agree, and union reps quickly voiced their opposition, saying it could further endanger the players' health.
"Yeah, 18 games sounds great when Roger is saying it on Pat McAfee's," said the Indianapolis Colts center Ryan Kelly, a member of the union's executive committee, referring to the ESPN interview. "But until you're the one going out there and putting a helmet on for 18 of those games, yeah, then come talk to me."
Not every owner favors an expanded schedule, either.
"People seem to think that it's a fait accompli, and maybe it will happen," John Mara, a co-owner of the Giants, said. But, he added, "I'm not a big fan of it. The season is long enough as it is."
But Mr. Mara is in the minority. Brian Rolapp, the league's top media and business officer, said that like many large companies, the league suffered from the "tyranny of big numbers" and must work harder to find new revenue. An 18-game schedule is one way to do that.
"It's a cliché, but I'll say it: Complacency is an enemy," Mr. Rolapp said.
Speaking of Mr. Goodell's predecessor, he added: "Paul Tagliabue had a line I remember. He said, 'If it ain't broke, fix it anyway.' I think there's a healthy paranoia here about how do you keep it going? How do you keep it growing? How do you keep it fresh?"
Teams are also contributing, Mr. Rolapp said. The Falcons, for example, are attracting more high-end fans to Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta by adding field-level suites behind the team benches that sell out at every event. Living-room-type suites on the second deck were added and sponsored by AT&T. The team opened a two-level private club, where members pay $ 15,000 a season. The club is sold out.
"It's the champagne kind of service crowd down there," the Falcons president Greg Beadles said.
These amenities are one reason the average cost of attending a game has jumped 44 percent since 2015, according to Freebets.com. But watching games at home has become more expensive, too, as the N.F.L. airs more of them exclusively on streaming platforms, which require subscriptions that can cost hundreds of dollars a year.
Mr. Goodell has defended the strategy, saying that fewer younger fans have cable television packages, so putting games on streaming services is a way to reach them.
"We have to fish where the fish are," Mr. Goodell said at the Super Bowl in February. "For us, it's part of the future."
Flag Football at the Olympics
The notion that the N.F.L. was greedy -- or too greedy, depending on your view -- was partly why Mr. Goodell flew to Los Angeles in June to testify in the antitrust trial brought by customers of the subscription service Sunday Ticket. The plaintiffs claimed that the league had colluded with CBS and Fox to inflate prices of the service, which shows all out-of-market games on Sundays. Mr. Goodell had never appeared as a witness in a federal trial, but the stakes were high because the case challenged a core of the league's business model: exclusive agreements with broadcasters.
Mr. Goodell's four-hour testimony, in which he said Sunday Ticket was a premium product and had been priced accordingly, didn't win over the jurors. Before he flew to Sun Valley, Idaho, for Allen & Company's conference for media and technology leaders in July, the jury returned a $ 4.7 billion verdict against the league.
In an appearance on "Squawk Box" on CNBC during the conference, Mr. Goodell vowed to appeal. That became moot on Aug. 1, when Judge Philip Gutierrez threw the case out of U.S. District Court because, he said, the plaintiffs' expert witnesses had used flawed logic when determining damages.
That let the owners exhale, and Mr. Goodell could jet to the Paris Games without a crisis on his hands. N.F.L. commissioners don't often attend the Olympics, but because of Mr. Goodell's lobbying, flag football will be included for the first time in 2028 at the Los Angeles Games.
The league has been promoting flag football in part to persuade nervous parents to let their sons and daughters pick up the game. When Mr. Goodell took over as commissioner, stories about players suffering from long-term brain damage were front-page news. He has pushed for better equipment and rule changes to reduce dangerous plays like hits to the head, though the repetitive hits that have been linked to neurological and cognitive problems later in life are nearly impossible to remove from the game.
Some critics call flag football a gateway to tackle football. Even Mr. Goodell acknowledges that flag football is not without its risks. But every N.F.L. team now sponsors youth flag leagues. In July, the N.F.L. hosted a championship weekend in Canton, Ohio, where more than 2,000 athletes from around the world competed, and ESPN showed some of the games.
Peter O'Reilly, who runs events for the league, said sponsors like Toyota and Visa had attached their names to the tournament during a lull in the N.F.L. calendar. He said the event could move around the country, a formula that had worked well for the draft.
"Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if other cities or teams were interested in hosting at some of their team complexes," Mr. O'Reilly said.
Expanding the Global Footprint
To the N.F.L., flag football is another way to keep fans involved in the league. That has been its approach to sports betting as well. The league doesn't make money on the bets themselves, but it sells tens of millions of dollars in sponsorships to gambling companies like Draft Kings.
It also makes money selling its real-time statistical feeds, which will be integrated into streams that fans can personalize, something the league hopes will further increase viewership.
"I know people are focused on betting and gambling, but to me, it's just about engagement," said Steve Bornstein, who previously ran the league's media group and is now the president of North America for the sports technology company Genius Sports. "You have all this data. The trick is how do you use it."
Another frontier is overseas. With the U.S. market near saturation, the league has been expanding its footprint across the globe. In Week 1 of the current season, the Philadelphia Eagles and the Green Bay Packers played in São Paulo, Brazil, the first N.F.L. game in South America and the 44th played on international soil since 2007. Global expansion is such a priority that Mr. Goodell flew to Brazil instead of to Kansas City, Mo., where the Super Bowl champion Chiefs hosted the season-opening game. (The Brazilian contest was streamed on Peacock.)
Not everyone is on board with the league's global push. Before heading out on a nine-hour flight to São Paulo, the Eagles cornerback Darius Slay Jr. questioned why the N.F.L. would play in a market where players had been told not to leave their hotels for their own safety.
"I'm like, N.F.L., why would you all want to send us somewhere where the crime rate is this high?" Mr. Slay said. "We're out of the country, and so the first thing we're thinking is something terrible could possibly happen."
But Mr. Goodell remains committed to the ambitious plan he outlined 14 years ago. He recently said the N.F.L. could play as many as 16 games a year overseas, up from five now, which could allow the league to create a new media-rights package -- and yet another huge payday for the N.F.L. owners and their expansionist commissioner.

As they met in the lobby of the Omni Viking Lakes Hotel in Minnesota in late August, Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, and Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, greeted each other warmly, sharing fist bumps as a small entourage that included their oldest sons surrounded them. The two men, who have nine Super Bowl wins between them (six for Kraft, 83, and three for Jones, who turns 82 on Sunday), were upbeat and refreshed after their summer vacations in the South of France and the Hamptons.
Soon they were joined in the lobby by other NFL royalty: the Kansas City Chiefs owner, Clark Hunt; the Pittsburgh Steelers owner, Art Rooney II; and, most significant, Roger Goodell, the league commissioner. There were smiles all around — and for good reason.
Over the next three hours, Goodell, 65, would preside over yet another decision that would make these already extremely wealthy individuals even richer: The league’s owners voted 31-1 to allow teams to sell up to 10% of their multibillion-dollar clubs to private equity groups.
The NBA, the NHL and MLB tapped private equity money years ago. But the NFL is the largest league with the best long-term prospects, which is why firms like Arctos Partners, Sixth Street Partners and others have been eager to bid for stakes in the Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins and other franchises. By year’s end, owners of NFL teams, worth on average $6.5 billion, may get nine-figure checks to help pay for new stadiums, buy out partners or retire debt.
The private equity move is the latest financial milestone in Goodell’s 18-year stewardship of the NFL. The son of a politician, he has spent his entire career in the league, starting as an intern after college, then climbing the ladder by tackling an array of jobs, including overseeing its international expansion and strong-arming cities to subsidize stadiums. By the time Goodell was elected commissioner in 2006, he was well aware that Jones, Kraft and other owners who had paid nine and 10 figures for their teams wanted faster returns on their investments.
Goodell has made sure that happens with aggressive moves over the past two decades that have made the NFL the wealthiest sports league in the world.
In 2010, at the league’s annual meeting at the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes, in Florida, Goodell and his chief financial officer, Anthony Noto, unveiled an audacious target: The NFL would hit $25 billion in revenue by 2027. The league generated about $8 billion at the time, double the amount it had 17 years earlier. Now Goodell wanted to more than triple its revenue in the next 17 years.
Owners and executives in the room shared sideways glances. The NFL was the country’s most lucrative league, but it was facing headwinds from a deep recession and a labor deal that the owners felt had given the players too big a share of the revenue. The owners were optimistic by nature, but not that optimistic.
But with the league now in its 105th season, Goodell’s goal is no longer an ambitious dream; it’s becoming a reality. The league has grown by about $1 billion a year since 2010 and now generates more than $20 billion in annual revenue.
In 2021, the league signed media rights contracts — its largest source of revenue — worth more than $110 billion. CBS, Fox and NBC agreed to pay more than $2 billion annually to hold on to their slots to broadcast games. And ESPN is shelling out about $2.7 billion a year to continue airing “Monday Night Football” and to be added into the rotation to broadcast the Super Bowl beginning in 2026.
In 2020, the owners persuaded the players to accept a 17th regular-season game, and in 2021, they added extra playoff games, changes that also increased revenue. In April, Goodell floated the idea of an 18th regular-season game, a contentious plan that would extend the season to late February. Revenue has also poured in from new stadiums in Las Vegas; Inglewood, California; and beyond.
As the league has prospered, so has Goodell: About 90% of the commissioner’s compensation is tied to a basket of metrics and incentives. After securing lucrative labor and broadcast deals and steering the league through the COVID-19 pandemic without missing a game, he received $63.9 million in each of the fiscal years running from April 2019 to March 2020 and April 2020 to March 2021, making him one of the highest-paid executives in the country. In October, Goodell signed an extension that will keep him atop the league through March 2027, when he will be 68. (Goodell declined to be interviewed for this article.)
Last year, 93 of the top 100 programs on television were NFL games. The number of NFL fans has increased to about 210 million, up from 170 million about a decade ago, according to figures supplied by the league. But the NFL has grown in part because Goodell and the owners take small, careful steps. The new private equity investment rules fit that pattern.
The owners began discussing accepting private equity in 2019 but chose to watch how other leagues handled the process first. The NFL wanted to preserve its governance structure, which relies heavily on owners to make most key decisions affecting the league. The owners were also wary of diluting the control of the multigenerational families that own the Chicago Bears, the New York Giants, the Steelers and other teams.
Most of those families have their wealth wrapped up in their teams and lack the cash to build splashy stadiums. As the value of teams has soared, they have found it harder to attract bidders wealthy enough to buy minority stakes that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
Private equity firms have access to billions of dollars and have been eager investors in sports. But they have a reputation for slashing costs at companies they acquire and flipping them for a quick profit, potential turmoil the NFL owners want to avoid.
So last year, Goodell created a committee that included Hunt; Kraft; the Atlanta Falcons owner, Arthur Blank; the Cleveland Browns owner, Jimmy Haslam; the Denver Broncos CEO, Greg Penner; and the Washington Commanders owner, Josh Harris, to design rules so teams could tap private equity money while keeping the firms at arm’s length.
In August, the league’s owners approved investment by four private equity groups. Three of them — Arctos, Sixth Street and Ares Management — can invest in no more than six teams at a time. The fourth group, a consortium that includes Blackstone and the Carlyle Group, can invest in up to 12 teams.
Goodell also jetted to the Paris Games this summer. NFL commissioners don’t often attend the Olympics, but because of Goodell’s lobbying, flag football will be included for the first time in 2028 at the Summer Games in Los Angeles.
The league has been promoting flag football in part to persuade parents to let their children pick up the game. When Goodell took over as commissioner, stories about players suffering from long-term brain damage were front-page news. He has pushed for better equipment and rule changes to reduce dangerous plays, though the repetitive hits to the head that have been linked to brain damage later in life are nearly impossible to remove from the game.
Some critics call flag football a gateway to tackle football. Even Goodell acknowledges that flag football is not without its risks. But every NFL team now sponsors youth flag leagues. In July, the NFL hosted a championship weekend in Canton, Ohio, where more than 2,000 athletes from around the world competed, and ESPN showed some of the games.
Peter O’Reilly, who runs events for the league, said sponsors like Toyota and Visa had attached their names to the tournament during a lull in the NFL calendar. He said the event could move around the country, a formula that had worked well for the draft.

Musk Unveils Self-Driving Tesla, but Skepticism Abounds: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "You could fall asleep and wake up at your destination," said Mr. Musk, Tesla's C.E.O., but some experts are skeptical that such cars will be ferrying passengers soon.
After years of promises, Tesla on Thursday unveiled a car that Elon Musk, the company's chief executive, said will be able to drive itself without human supervision. Mr. Musk has said the vehicle will add trillions of dollars to the company's stock market value and fuel its growth.
The "robotaxi," which Mr. Musk also referred to as a "cybercab," will cost less than $ 30,000 and be available before 2027, he said. He acknowledged, "I tend to be a little optimistic."
Investors, who had high expectations for the presentation, were disappointed by that timeline and the lack of details about the company's plans. Tesla's share price was down about 8 percent on Friday afternoon.
The product, which does not have a steering wheel or pedals, is a prototype of a self-driving taxi that Mr. Musk has staked Tesla's future on.
Mr. Musk promised that the vehicle, which appeared to be made of stainless steel, will be able to ferry passengers to any destination without human intervention, a feat that other companies have achieved in just a few places, like Phoenix and San Francisco.
"You could fall asleep and wake up at your destination," he said.
The much-anticipated unveiling event at the Warner Bros. studio near Los Angeles began almost an hour late after one of the invitation-only guests suffered a medical emergency, according to Mr. Musk. Guests were offered rides around movie sets, but some were unimpressed.
Analysts at BNP Paribas Exane called the event a disappointment and said it appeared to be little more than a demonstration of Tesla's existing software "in a different body shell on a handful of concept vehicles, navigating a carefully sanitized movie studio lot with no pedestrians, cats, dogs, etc."
Tesla's existing cars, including the Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle, will be able to offer robotic taxi rides in Texas and California well before the new vehicle becomes available, Mr. Musk said.
But many experts are doubtful that such Tesla taxis will hit the roads anytime soon. Mr. Musk has for several years claimed that the company was months away from starting a Robotaxi service. In addition, the autonomous driving technology Tesla offers today can make basic mistakes, requiring drivers to intervene to avoid accidents or violating traffic laws.
Still, Mr. Musk's supporters and fans believe that the Robotaxi will open a lucrative line of business that will more than make up for Tesla's recent struggles in the electric car market, where it has lost market share to more established carmakers. Mr. Musk has said people will be able to purchase Robotaxis for personal use and earn extra money by allowing the vehicles to ferry passengers, the automotive equivalent of listing a home on Airbnb.
"This is a game changer," Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity firm that invests in sustainable transportation but does not own shares in Tesla, said in an email after the event. "If this technology works well, it will completely change personal car ownership and mobility."
But Ms. Natarajan questioned whether Tesla's technology, which relies on cameras to navigate, will be able to operate in any conditions, as Mr. Musk has promised. Most other carmakers also use laser sensors to detect people and objects.
Other analysts and autonomous driving experts said there was little evidence that Tesla was close to perfecting the technology and making a profit from it.
A car capable of functioning as a self-driving taxi "is still several years away, and numerous technological hurdles, safety tests and regulatory approvals are still standing in the way," Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said in a note this week.
For Tesla investors, whose shares are trading for about the same price they were at the beginning of the year, much was riding on the event.
Tesla's status as the most valuable car company in the world was once based on Mr. Musk's claim that the company would sell 20 million cars a year by the end of the decade, twice as many as Toyota and more than 10 times as many as Tesla sold last year.
Lately, as sales growth at Tesla has slowed, Mr. Musk has stopped emphasizing that goal and instead staked the company's future on self-driving technology. People who don't believe in Tesla's ability to conquer the obstacles to fully autonomous driving "should not be an investor in the company," Mr. Musk said in April.
Many analysts are skeptical that, even if Tesla can perfect the technology, it will deliver the profits Mr. Musk has forecast. Tom Narayan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, estimated that self-driving taxis would generate $ 1.7 billion in revenue from riders worldwide in 2040. But Tesla will own only a slice of the market, Mr. Narayan said.
"This is not happening in big numbers anytime soon," he added.
On Thursday Tesla also showed the latest version of its Optimus humanoid robot. A film showed the robots serving drinks, playing board games with children and unloading groceries from a car.
"This will be the biggest product ever of any kind," Mr. Musk said.
In a surprise, Tesla also rolled out an autonomous "robovan" capable of transporting 20 people. "We're going to build this," Mr. Musk said. But the company disappointed some investors who had hoped to see a prototype of a Tesla car priced lower than existing models. Tesla has said such a car will go on sale next year.
Tesla already sells a monthly subscription for a system it calls Supervised Full Self-Driving to owners of its electric vehicles. But the company says drivers using it must be ready to intervene at any moment if the software makes a mistake.
A ride last week in a Tesla Model 3 equipped with the latest version of Full Self-Driving indicated that the company still has work to do.
The car's performance during a drive through Manhattan and Queens was impressive at times. It was courteous to pedestrians, once stopping, in the Rockaway Beach neighborhood, for two children who were stepping off a sidewalk onto a four-lane street where there was no crosswalk or traffic signal.
But on numerous other occasions the car avoided accidents or illegal maneuvers only because the driver intervened. The car was being driven by Guy Mangiamele, director of vehicle testing for AMCI Testing, a Los Angeles-based research firm that assesses vehicle performance for car companies and other customers.
With full self-driving engaged, the car became confused in a tunnel between Manhattan and Queens, slowing dangerously in heavy traffic. In Manhattan's financial district, the car ran a red light. It tried to make a left turn onto West 29th Street from a middle lane of the Avenue of the Americas, and would have cut off a police car had Mr. Mangiamele not intervened.
Mr. Mangiamele, who has tested the software over hundreds of miles in various locations, called it an "incredible accomplishment" that nonetheless has "glaring shortcomings."
Accidents attributed to earlier versions of Tesla software have prompted numerous lawsuits and an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agency has said the technology does not adequately ensure that drivers remain attentive. In April, it issued a report linking hundreds of accidents and at least 29 fatal crashes to the use of Tesla's driver-assistance systems.
Mr. Musk has long said that Tesla vehicles would be able to operate without human intervention. His unfulfilled promises prompted a class-action lawsuit by the Oakland County, Mich., pension fund and other shareholders who claimed he misled them about the company's technology in violation of securities laws.
But a federal judge in California ruled in favor of Tesla last month, citing laws that allow executives to make optimistic statements even if they later prove to be untrue. The ruling grants broad leeway to Mr. Musk.
Tesla is not the only company pursuing self-driving taxis. In China, the tech giant Baidu is testing autonomous taxis on public streets. Waymo, a subsidiary of Google's parent company, has been operating a driverless taxi service for years. It recently said its cars were providing more than 100,000 rides a week in San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles. Cruise, a unit of General Motors, recently restarted testing driverless taxis after one of its cars hit and dragged a pedestrian last year in San Francisco. And Zoox, owned by Amazon, is testing a driverless van that has no steering wheel with plans to start a paying service.
Analysts say it will probably be years before those companies or Tesla is running a profitable taxi service in many urban areas. And even then such services will need sizable teams of engineers, mechanics, cleaners and others to operate.
"Elon's Robotaxi represents a potential paradigm shift in the transportation industry," Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars, a used car shopping site, said in a statement this week, "but it's not going to happen overnight."

Volkswagen's Troubles Reflect Wider Issues in German Economy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Germany's largest automaker rode a wave of strong sales for years, but lagging demand and pressure from China are forcing it to consider layoffs.
No industry is more important to the German economy than automobiles. And no carmaker is more important than Volkswagen.
Now, as the 87-year-old automaker is floating the prospect of job cuts and factory closures as it seeks to return to profitability, Volkswagen's struggles are being reflected in the overall troubles facing the country, which is grappling with a shrinking industrial sector and an economy that is forecast to contract for a second consecutive year.
"The fact that Volkswagen, Germany's largest car manufacturer, largest industrial employer and the world's No. 2 behind Japanese carmaker Toyota, is no longer ruling out plant closures and compulsory redundancies shows how deep the German industry is now in crisis," said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany.
The issues dragging on profitability at Volkswagen's core brand -- high-priced labor, cumbersome organizational structures and an inability to keep up with advances by Chinese automakers -- mirror those facing Germany's overall economy.
On Monday, the German government said the economy would contract 0.2 percent in 2024, down from a previous projection of 0.3 percent growth. Dragging output down is the industrial sector, which has failed to recover from the shocks of the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Germany also appears to have lost some clout in the European Union, which voted on Friday to impose higher tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, a key trading partner of Germany.
Some economists trace the root of the problems, both at Volkswagen and in Germany as a whole, to a missed opportunity to invest in the future during what many call the "golden decade," when the country's output expanded 14 percent after the global economic downturn of 2008.
"The German economy did really well, and so did Volkswagen," said Jens Südekum, an economist at Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf.
In those years, Volkswagen exported cars with combustion engines across Europe and to China, becoming the largest automaker in the world by sales in 2016. It held that position until 2019, despite a scandal over illegal cheating on emissions tests in Europe and United States, which cost the company more than 31 billion euros, or $ 34.6 billion.
The German government racked up budget surpluses from 2014 to 2019. Interest rates were negative, and Germany could have borrowed to invest in public infrastructure, digitization and the transformation to a green economy. Instead, it passed a law enshrining a balanced budget into its Constitution, a move that continues to limit investment.
"In a sense, Germany was too successful and people become complacent, thinking that success would just go on forever," Mr. Südekum said. "And now we know that's just not the case."
The same could be said of Volkswagen, which has sold millions of gas-powered cars in China since the 1990s. But it failed to take seriously the threat posed by Chinese brands such as BYD, Geely and Nio, which focused on developing fully electric and hybrid cars and building a supply chain to support them.
The lack of foresight vexed IG Metall, which represents 120,000 Volkswagen workers in Germany. The union has raised mismanagement claims against Volkswagen's leaders, who have scrambled to invest billions in recent years to shift production at German plants to electric vehicles.
Thousands of workers at Volkswagen staged a rally last month ahead of the first round of wage talks with company leaders. The workers blew whistles and banged on drums, vowing to defend the 120,000 jobs at six factories in Germany and demanding a wage increase of 7 percent.
"Cutbacks are not a future concept," Thorsten Gröger, a lead negotiator for IG Metall, told the crowd, which had gathered in the courtyard of the summer palace of the House of Hanover, a former royal dynasty. He called for the automaker to reduce bureaucracy and complexity and develop a strategy for the survival.
But company representatives point to the generous benefits enjoyed by Volkswagen's workers, including the possibility for up to 36 vacation days -- six more than the industry standard.
"We must reduce our labor costs in Germany," Arne Meiswinkel, the human resources chief at Volkswagen and lead negotiator for the company, said as talks started. "We can only maintain our top position and safeguard jobs in the long term if we work more economically."
Workers are pushing back, saying that while they are being asked to make concessions, Volkswagen in the past year has paid out €4.5 billion in dividends. The automaker also said this year that it would invest up to €5 billion in Rivian, a U.S. maker of electric trucks that has struggled to turn a profit.
"Try explaining that to the workers here," said Stefan Henze, a union representative from Volkswagen's software division, Cariad. "It doesn't add up."
The Volkswagen Group, which owns 10 brands, including Porsche and Audi, is in a stronger position than its flagship brand, which reported a 5 percent drop in its profit margin in the first six months of 2024.
German media have reported that as many as 30,000 jobs could be lost -- a number that the company has so far declined to confirm. Such a move would not be without precedent. The company let more than 37,000 employees go from 1971 and 1975, a move that it credits with turning around profitability at the time.
Workers have vowed to take their fight to the streets as soon as a mandatory peace period surrounding the start of talks expires, which could happen by the end of November at the latest.
"Talking has never saved any jobs," a programmer from a Volkswagen factory that produces electric motors, who gave her name only as Anne-Marie, said at the rally in Hanover.
German politicians have weighed whether they should intervene to help shore up Volkswagen, especially in the face of the economic slowdown the country is facing. The automobile industry provides work for 773,000 people, not including jobs at hundreds of smaller companies and suppliers.
One of the largest suppliers, ZF, announced this year that it would cut up to 14,000 jobs within four years, citing a drop in demand for electric vehicles among the reasons.
Last year, the German government abruptly stopped a subsidy to encourage the sale of electric cars, causing many customers to pull back. The move not only hurt demand, but it also caused customers to question Europe's overall ambition to ban the sale of new cars with combustion engines by 2035.
In recent weeks, some politicians in Germany have called for the ban to be lifted, or at least extended, a move that economists say creates further confusion for consumers.
At the same time, the European Union is readying to increase tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, with the aim of leveling the playing field for European automakers, which they argue have not benefited from the amount of state subsidies that their Chinese counterparts receive.
But Volkswagen, which is heavily invested in China, and the German government oppose the levies, which they fear could lead to retaliation from China.
Economists also warn that duties risk further harming growth when European companies like Volkswagen need to be able to be fast and flexible if they are to remain competitive.
"There should just be an eye toward less regulation and more allowing firms to be more nimble and encouraging further investment," said Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University who grew up in Hanover and studies the Germany economy.

E.V. Subsidies Are a Plus but Also Have Drawbacks, Researchers Say: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Inflation Reduction Act was a compromise between competing priorities. Evaluating the law on the effectiveness of the $ 7,500 tax credit for E.V.s is tricky.
A team of economists has taken on a central component of the Inflation Reduction Act: the $ 7,500 tax credit for U.S.-made electric vehicles.
The challenge in evaluating it is that the policy has sometimes conflicting goals. One is getting people to buy electric vehicles to lower carbon emissions and slow climate change. The other is strengthening U.S. auto manufacturing by denying subsidies to foreign companies, even for better or cheaper electric vehicles.
That's why totaling those pluses and minuses is complex, but overall the researchers found that Americans have seen a two-to-one return on their investment in the new electric vehicle subsidies. That includes environmental benefits, but mostly reflects a shift of profits to the United States. Before the climate law, tax credits were mainly used to buy foreign-made cars.
"What the I.R.A. did was swing the pendulum the other way, and heavily subsidized American carmakers," said Felix Tintelnot, an associate professor of economics at Duke University who was a co-author of the paper.
Those benefits were undermined, however, by a loophole allowing dealers to apply the subsidy to leases of foreign-made electric vehicles. The provision sends profits to non-American companies, and since those foreign-made vehicles are on average heavier and less efficient, they impose more environmental and road-safety costs.
Also, the researchers estimated that for every additional electric vehicle the new tax credits put on the road, about three other electric vehicle buyers would have made the purchases even without a $ 7,500 credit. That dilutes the effectiveness of the subsidies, which are forecast to cost as much as $ 390 billion through 2031. "The I.R.A. was worth the money invested," said Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist at Cox Automotive, which provided some of the data used in the analysis. "But in essence, my conclusion is that we could do better."
The paper, which has not been peer-reviewed, was published on Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Economists often circulate early-stage research that is relevant to policy debates for discussion and comment, and it is sometimes substantially revised.
Trade restrictions have been among the more debated parts of the Biden administration's climate-oriented industrial policy. Focusing subsidies on U.S. companies helped gain enough political support to pass the law. But some environmentalists say it slowed progress on carbon emissions, and it irked America's trading partners.
And there are more trade-offs: The leasing loophole, while a negative in the researchers' cost-benefit model, may have averted retaliatory measures from European countries.
"Frankly, I think it highlights all the difficulties associated with subsidy-based policies that aren't faced if you have something like a carbon price," said Catherine Wolfram, an economics professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management who reviewed the paper.
Dr. Wolfram was a climate and energy adviser at the Treasury Department while the climate law was under development. Her preferred approach -- and that of most economists -- has long been a tax on carbon, which she argues would reduce greenhouse gas emissions more efficiently.
But cars impose harms beyond carbon emissions, which the study's authors tried to compile for hundreds of vehicle models. As it turns out, size matters.
First, using the Environmental Protection Agency's "social cost of carbon" metric, they calculated the dollar cost of each model's lifetime carbon emissions from both manufacturing and driving. On average, emissions by gas-powered vehicles impose 57 percent greater costs than electric vehicles.
The study then calculated harms from air pollution other than greenhouse gases -- smog, for example. That's where electric vehicles start to perform relatively poorly, since generating the electricity for them still creates pollution. Those harms will probably fade as more wind and solar energy comes online, but they are significant.
Finally, the authors added the road deaths associated with heavier cars. Batteries are heavy, so electric vehicles -- especially the largest -- are likelier to kill people in crashes.
Totaling these costs and then subtracting fiscal benefits through gas taxes and electricity bills, electric vehicles impose $ 16,003 in net harms, the authors said, while gas vehicles impose $ 19,239. But the range is wide, with the largest electric vehicles far outpacing many internal combustion cars. Take a large electric pickup truck like the Rivian, and the compact hybrid Toyota Prius, which is excluded from the tax credits.
"The harms imposed by the Rivian are three times the harms imposed by the Prius, in terms of air pollution and death from accidents," said Hunt Allcott, a co-author and professor of global environmental policy at Stanford University. "But we are subsidizing the Rivian and not the Prius."
Of course, getting people to switch to a smaller car can be as hard as getting them to switch to an electric one.
Elaine Buckberg, a senior fellow at the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability at Harvard University and former chief economist at General Motors, said she learned that consumers are fixed in their preferences.
"You'd have to encourage bringing down the size of both the internal combustion engine and the E.V. to get people to buy smaller E.V.s," Dr. Buckberg said. "Otherwise, they're just going to stay with internal combustion engines for longer."

Full text: I'm an international correspondent based in Mexico City. I've spent most of my career in Latin America, so I'm always combining my fascination for the region with interests that run a bit more escapist.
Here are five things I've recently heard, seen or watched.
Six Is Not a Crowd
This romantic comedy series from Argentina (also called "Felices los 6") explores what happens when a man living a ho-hum existence falls for a free-spirited woman in a polycule. Passion, jealousy and community are all deftly handled with Argentine humor.
Museo Anahuacalli
A monolith forged from volcanic stone, this unusual museum in the Coyoacán area of Mexico City has the dystopian vibe of a cavernous crypt. The muralist Diego Rivera created it to house his vast pre-Hispanic art collection, and the architect Juan O'Gorman helped complete the project. Its gardens of towering cactuses are stunning.
In Our Time
I'm a die-hard fan of this weekly BBC series, in which Melvyn Bragg chews the fat with historians, philosophers and other scholars. So imagine my despair when they go on their summer break. Fortunately there are more than 1,000 episodes to choose from, like a recent gem about the Sack of Rome in 1527.
Blooming in the Ruins: How Mexican Philosophy Can Guide Us Toward the Good Life
Surprisingly breezy to read, this book revealed mind-blowing concepts from a field I didn't know existed. It subtly mixes practical advice on how to avoid becoming an online troll and why one should arrive late to parties with autobiographical insights from the author, Carlos Alberto Sánchez, the son of undocumented immigrant farmworkers.
@toyotafreaks
This account mixes off-road high jinks, glimpses of retro Toyota trucks and gossip about the company's new four-wheel-drive offerings. As the owner of a banged-up old (but still running!) Land Cruiser currently parked back in New Mexico, where I'm from, I love seeing all these Yotas in the wild. Keep on truckin'.

Toyota Adds $ 500 Million To Joby Air Taxi Project
Toyota is investing another $ 500 million in Joby Aviation as part of a partnership aimed at helping get the American air taxi company's commercial business off the ground.
Toyota's investment will be used to support certification and production of Joby's electric air taxi, the companies said Wednesday, and brings Toyota Motor's total investment in Joby to $ 894 million. After the investment, which will come in two equal tranches later this year and next, Toyota will own about 22 percent of Joby's outstanding shares.
"Today's investment builds on nearly seven years of collaboration between our companies," said JoeBen Bevirt, founder and CEO, Joby Aviation. "The knowledge and support shared by Toyota has been instrumental in Joby's success and we look forward to deepening our relationship as we deliver on our shared vision for the future of air travel."

PHARMACEUTICALS
Eli Lilly Plans to Build New $ 4.5 Billion Facility
Eli Lilly is pouring $ 4.5 billion into expanding manufacturing and development as the drugmaker rakes in billions from new product sales.
The diabetes treatment maker said on Wednesday that it will build a new center for advanced manufacturing and drug development a few miles from its Indianapolis headquarters.
The company said its Lilly Medicine Foundry will allow it to both research new ways of making drugs and build up manufacturing for clinical trials. Work on the site will start next year.
Lilly will add the center to a site in Lebanon, Indiana, where it is already spending about $ 9 billion to improve manufacturing of its popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs, Zepbound and Mounjaro.
Those drugs have brought fresh revenue and prompted Lilly in August to push its annual forecast beyond Wall Street expectations. Associated Press
HEALTH INSURANCE
Walmart Offers Workers Expanded Cancer Care
Walmart's employees and their dependents are being offered expanded cancer treatment with doctors at the Mayo Clinic through the retailer's insurance.
The nation's largest private employer said Wednesday that those covered by the insurance and diagnosed with most types of cancer will be able to get a second opinion from the Mayo Clinic and travel to the clinic for treatment if needed.
The retail giant's action comes as more employers seek better care options and are paying particular attention to cancer treatments, benefits experts say.
Walmart's cancer program had been offering employees help from the Mayo Clinic on breast, lung, colon, prostate, pancreatic and blood cancers. It is now expanding the coverage to include most other cancers.
The only exceptions are three skin cancers: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and localized melanoma, the company said. Associated Press

Stocks Tumble As Japan Gets A New Leader: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Stocks dropped after Japan's governing party chose Shigeru Ishiba, a critic of the country's longstanding ultralow interest rates, as its leader.
Stocks in Japan fell sharply on Monday after the country's governing party chose a leader some view as hawkish on interest rates, underlining how central bank decisions continue to set the course of the world's fourth-largest economy after decades of easy money policy.
On Friday, Japan's Liberal Democratic Party elected Shigeru Ishiba, a proponent of raising interest rates to help curb inflation, as Japan's next prime minister.
Mr. Ishiba narrowly defeated Sanae Takaichi, a disciple of Shinzo Abe who remains committed to the former prime minister's longstanding policies aimed at strengthening Japan's economy by maintaining ultralow interest rates.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell 4.8 percent on Monday.
Some economists said the decline, which they described as the "Ishiba Shock," was caused by the unwinding of stock trading that reflected expectations that Ms. Takaichi would be elected.
The market jitters show how the recent L.D.P. election came at a pivotal moment for the Japanese economy.
After a recent surge of inflation, the Bank of Japan has raised interest rates twice this year. The bank's governor, Kazuo Ueda, has indicated he plans to continue increasing rates, though it is unclear how quickly that might happen.
This month, the Bank of Japan held rates steady, with some suggesting it was waiting for political dynamics related to the L.D.P. election and other factors to stabilize.
In recent years, the significant gap between Japan's rock-bottom interest rates and higher rates in the United States has led investors to seek higher returns outside Japan.
This has weakened the yen, which in turn lifted the share prices of major Japanese companies that benefited from the bump up in their profits overseas.
Some economists and analysts have questioned whether the rise in Japanese stocks over the past two years was a bubble driven by the weak yen. Share price declines on Monday were led by Japan's big exporters, including Toyota Motor, which fell nearly 8 percent.
Given Ms. Takaichi's criticism of the Bank of Japan's rate increases, the stock market rally seemed poised to continue. On Friday, after Ms. Takaichi took the lead in the first round of voting, the yen quickly weakened and Japan's benchmark stock index rose.
The movements in the yen began to reverse when Mr. Ishiba was elected after Tokyo markets closed for the day. The yen was trading at around 142 to the dollar on Monday, compared with more than 146 on Friday.
In comments on Friday evening, Mr. Ishiba reiterated his belief that to bolster Japan's economy, interest rate increases, rather than cuts, would be necessary to help bring down inflation and stimulate sluggish consumer spending.
Mr. Ishiba, who is set to take office on Tuesday, also addressed other major focuses, including supporting Japan's regional economies and encouraging the relocation of production bases back to Japan. On Monday, he announced that a general election will be held on Oct. 27, allowing the public to vote on the members of the legislature's lower house.
Major banks believe that the market movements may represent the extent of big reactions to the L.D.P. election. Mr. Ishiba appeared to attempt to calm investors over the weekend by saying that borrowing in Japan should remain relatively low-cost.
Barclays researchers wrote in a note that Mr. Ishiba is likely to respect the independence of the Bank of Japan's interest rate decisions. They maintained their forecast for a bump up in interest rates in January.

For Car Insurance, Shopping Didn't Help: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: We were bound to fail. We just didn't know it when we started our quest.
When our latest car insurance premium notices landed, we were shocked: Tara's premiums had risen more than 62 percent to $ 2,315 since late 2020. Ron, with a car that is three years younger than Tara's and has a plug-in hybrid battery that would be expensive to replace, was experiencing sky-high costs of $ 3,396 per year.
If you own a car, it's no secret that auto insurance prices have soared. Motor-vehicle insurance premiums have increased 51 percent in just three years, according to the latest data from the Consumer Price Index. A confluence of factors is to blame. Cars are more expensive to repair and replace, accidents are on the rise (phone fiddling is an ever-present risk) and weather-related claims are also increasing.
Could we shop our way out of this mess? We were all for trying, but it wasn't going to be easy.
We would also have to contend with the fact that we both live in Brooklyn. It's densely populated, which insurance companies don't like. Theft rates are high, and catalytic converters are catnip for bad actors.
People in other states have to grapple with their own idiosyncrasies, like the golf-ball-size hail in Minnesota, where premiums are projected to rise 61 percent in 2024, according to Insurify, an insurance shopping and comparison website.
Still, we liked our odds. With no teenage drivers or scofflaw spouses -- plus spotless credit and solid records on the road -- we hunkered down on Tara's back porch this week, laptops and phones at the ready.
The Incumbent Carriers to Beat
We started with our current insurance companies and began by making sure we understood our existing coverage. This wasn't easy; Ron made a spreadsheet with 24 lines on it, representing all the features of the USAA policy for his 2021 Toyota RAV4 Prime.
We tried to map Tara's GEICO coverage for her 2018 Subaru Forester onto the spreadsheet, but in what became a continuing theme once we started shopping around, some of GEICO's terminology didn't match USAA's.
Nevertheless, we pressed on. The easiest way to save money on car insurance is to raise deductibles or lower the amount of coverage with your current carrier. We had both maxed out our deductibles and didn't want to risk lowering our coverage amounts.
The pleasant GEICO rep assured Tara that the crazy spike in her premiums wasn't personal and that she was receiving all the discounts she was eligible for as a longtime customer in good standing.
There was one thing she could wipe away: roughly $ 50 a year for mechanical breakdown coverage that would end in about a year anyway.
At USAA, the only way to achieve big savings was to let the company track Ron's driving habits using his cellphone. Many major insurance companies have similar initiatives, and USAA claimed Ron could save "up to" 30 percent.
Ron had questions. The back-and-forth with the phone rep led to a fair bit of confusion about what the company does and does not track, though it definitely tries to detect "harsh" braking and unsafe use of a phone while driving.
Comparison Sites
Several companies try to make money by bringing the old-fashioned insurance agency -- a storefront, say, where you can stop in and get quotes from many insurers -- online. We tried a bunch of them, including Insurify, Lemonade, Policygenius and the Zebra, and were profoundly underwhelmed (though sometimes amused).
None of these companies delivered price quotes that beat our current rates, and we often saw the same two insurance companies on different sites -- Progressive and GEICO.
In many instances, we couldn't input enough granular information to know whether the quote would match our current coverage. Other times, we couldn't ask for a high enough amount of coverage.
Over at Policygenius, Ron saw a company called GAINSCO bidding for his business, but it soon referred him to Progressive. A few minutes later, he got a call from a State Farm representative in Schenectady, N.Y.
Ron asked him how he had gotten his number, and he said it had just popped up on his computer as a live lead. State Farm's quote was way too high, but we admired the guy's pluck. A State Farm spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment, and it is not clear how Ron's phone number ended up on the screen.
Tara tried most of the same comparison sites, and it felt like all roads led back to Flo -- maybe Progressive was one of the few carriers still seeking new business? It came closest to her rate at GEICO but still cost more for less coverage.
Going Direct
Next we tried a few well-regarded insurers that didn't show up on the comparison sites. We found them through a recent study from J.D. Power, an analytics firm, which ranked carriers by region.
Tara received quotes from Amica and Erie Insurance, which practically screamed, "We don't want your business." Their rates were 89 and 44 percent more than her current premium. They came closer to matching Ron's rate, but not close enough.
The Brooklyn Storefront
After spending so much time online, we were ready for sustenance -- and assistance from a warmblooded human. After a pit stop at Lioni for excellent hero sandwiches, we visited one of those old-school storefronts, this one in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn. It had several desks filled with piles of paper, but humans were visible, burrowed in behind the stacks.
We introduced ourselves as reporters from The New York Times and met an insurance agent, with more than three decades of experience, who said she would try to assist us. Given the current rates in the market, she wasn't terribly optimistic. She told us that she had never seen anything like this before -- and found it depressing.
The good part about most humans is that they will level with you in a way that a robot won't. Right away, the agent raised her eyebrows and told Ron that USAA was going to be hard to beat. She didn't even think it was worthwhile to offer him a quote.
Not everyone can get USAA auto insurance in the first place, since only members of the military, most former members, eligible family and a few other limited groups of people can apply. (We thank Ron's late father, Fred, for his service.)
The agent did generate a solid rate for Tara from Travelers, but GEICO still had the edge.
So after all of that, we are back where we started. Ron is weighing his feelings about USAA's watching him. Tara is contemplating the wisdom of reducing her coverage.
Industry professionals were not that surprised that we couldn't save money, given what it costs insurers to buy car parts and pay for people to install them.
"Inflation impacted everyone, all at once," said Dale Porfilio, chief insurance officer at the Insurance Information Institute.
Or did we not push the right buttons? If you're an independent insurance agent and think we missed a step, we're easy to find via our individual pages on nytimes.com.

Markets Split Wildly in Asia, but Wall Street Hits Highs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street closed its latest winning month and quarter with more records on Monday. The drift higher for U.S. stocks followed a wild start to the week for financial markets in Asia, where Japanese stocks tumbled and Chinese indexes soared.
The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 percent to a high and clinched its fifth-straight winning month and fourth-straight winning quarter. The Dow Jones industrial average added 17 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to its record set on Friday. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.4 percent.
Wall Street has catapulted to records on hopes the slowing U.S. economy can keep growing while the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates to offer it more juice. A big test will arrive Friday, when the U.S. government offers its latest monthly update on the job market.
An overriding worry on Wall Street is whether the economy may already be heading for a recession. Even though the Fed cut rates this month and has indicated more relief is on the way, U.S. employers have already begun paring back on their hiring. Before this month, the Fed had kept interest rates at a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the economy enough to stamp out inflation.
"Payrolls remain the biggest catalyst" for the U.S. stock market until the election, strategists and economists at Bank of America wrote in a research report.
At Goldman Sachs, the economist David Mericle said he's expecting Friday's report to show hiring in September was stronger than the 146,000 growth in payrolls that economists across Wall Street were broadly forecasting.
In the past, a stronger-than-expected number could have hurt the stock market by fanning worries about upward pressure on inflation. Now, though, it would likely be welcomed as a signal that a recession shouldn't be a worry.
Interest rates and the strength of the economy are usually the two main levers that set prices for stocks. In Asia, the levers were pulling in opposite directions.
Japan's Nikkei 225 slumped 4.8 percent on worries that the country's incoming prime minister will support higher interest rates and other policies that investors see as less market-friendly.
Mr. Ishiba has expressed support for the Bank of Japan's move to pull interest rates away from their near-zero level, which puts upward pressure on the value of the Japanese yen. A stronger yen can hurt profits for Japanese exporters, which make sales in other currencies and then convert them back into yen.
Toyota Motor's stock fell 7.6 percent in Tokyo, while Honda Motor's dropped 7 percent. Monday.
Stellantis, the company that owns the Jeep brand and others, tumbled 14.7 percent in Milan after cutting its forecast for upcoming profit. It cited investments to turn around its U.S. operations and increased Chinese competition.
That in turn helped drag down Ford Motor and General Motors on Wall Street. Ford fell 2 percent, and G.M. dropped 3.5 percent.
A 2.3 percent rise for Apple helped offset such losses and was the strongest force lifting the S&P 500 to its latest record. After weakening in late July with other Big Tech stocks amid worries their prices had shot too high, Apple's stock has been climbing back toward its closing high of $ 234.82. It finished Monday at $ 233.00.
All told, the S&P 500 rose 24.31 points to 5,762.48. The Dow added 17.15 to 42,330.15, and the Nasdaq gained 69.58 to 18,189.17.
In China, meanwhile, indexes soared 8.1 percent in Shanghai and 2.4 percent in Hong Kong following the latest announcements of stimulus for the world's second-largest economy. It was the best day for Shanghai stocks in nearly 16 years.
China's central bank announced moves on Sunday to ease mortgage rates for existing home loans by Oct. 31. That followed announcements last week from China's central bank and government intended to prop up the Chinese economy, whose growth has flagged in part because of a struggling real-estate sector.

We Tried to Shop Our Way to Cheaper Car Insurance. It Didn’t Work.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — We were bound to fail. We just didn’t know it when we started our quest.
When our latest car insurance premium notices landed, we were shocked: Tara’s premiums had risen more than 62% to $2,315 since late 2020. Ron, with a car that is three years younger than Tara’s and has a plug-in hybrid battery that would be expensive to replace, was experiencing sky-high costs of $3,396 per year.
If you own a car, it’s no secret that auto insurance prices have soared. Motor-vehicle insurance premiums have increased 51% in just three years, according to the latest data from the consumer price index. A confluence of factors is to blame. Cars are more expensive to repair and replace, accidents are on the rise (phone fiddling is an ever-present risk) and weather-related claims are also increasing.
Could we shop our way out of this mess? We were all for trying, but it wasn’t going to be easy.
We would also have to contend with the fact that we both live in Brooklyn. It’s densely populated, which insurance companies don’t like. Theft rates are high, and catalytic converters are catnip for bad actors.
People in other states have to grapple with their own idiosyncrasies, like the golf-ball-size hail in Minnesota, where premiums are projected to rise 61% in 2024, according to Insurify, an insurance shopping and comparison website.
Still, we liked our odds. With no teenage drivers or scofflaw spouses — plus spotless credit and solid records on the road — we hunkered down on Tara’s back porch last week, laptops and phones at the ready.
The Incumbent Carriers to Beat
We started with our current insurance companies and began by making sure we understood our existing coverage. This wasn’t easy; Ron made a spreadsheet with 24 lines on it, representing all the features of the USAA policy for his 2021 Toyota RAV4 Prime.
We tried to map Tara’s GEICO coverage for her 2018 Subaru Forester onto the spreadsheet, but in what became a continuing theme once we started shopping around, some of GEICO’s terminology didn’t match USAA’s.
Nevertheless, we pressed on. The easiest way to save money on car insurance is to raise deductibles or lower the amount of coverage with your current carrier. We had both maxed out our deductibles and didn’t want to risk lowering our coverage amounts.
The pleasant GEICO rep assured Tara that the crazy spike in her premiums wasn’t personal and that she was receiving all the discounts she was eligible for as a longtime customer in good standing.
There was one thing she could wipe away: roughly $50 a year for mechanical breakdown coverage that would end in about a year anyway.
At USAA, the only way to achieve big savings was to let the company track Ron’s driving habits using his cellphone. Many major insurance companies have similar initiatives, and USAA claimed Ron could save “up to” 30%.
Ron had questions. The back-and-forth with the phone rep led to a fair bit of confusion about what the company does and does not track, though it definitely tries to detect “harsh” braking and unsafe use of a phone while driving.
Comparison Sites
Several companies try to make money by bringing the old-fashioned insurance agency — a storefront, say, where you can stop in and get quotes from many insurers — online. We tried a bunch of them, including Insurify, Lemonade, Policygenius and the Zebra, and were profoundly underwhelmed (though sometimes amused).
None of these companies delivered price quotes that beat our current rates, and we often saw the same two insurance companies on different sites — Progressive and GEICO.
In many instances, we couldn’t input enough granular information to know whether the quote would match our current coverage. Other times, we couldn’t ask for a high enough amount of coverage.
Over at Policygenius, Ron saw a company called GAINSCO bidding for his business, but it soon referred him to Progressive. A few minutes later, he got a call from a State Farm representative in Schenectady, New York.
Ron asked the rep how he had gotten his number, and the agent said it had just popped up on his computer as a live lead. State Farm’s quote was way too high, but we admired the guy’s pluck. A State Farm spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment, and it is not clear how Ron’s phone number ended up on the screen.
Tara tried most of the same comparison sites, and it felt like all roads led back to Flo — maybe Progressive was one of the few carriers still seeking new business? It came closest to her rate at GEICO but still cost more for less coverage.
Going Direct
Next we tried a few well-regarded insurers that didn’t show up on the comparison sites. We found them through a recent study from J.D. Power, an analytics firm, which ranked carriers by region.
Tara received quotes from Amica and Erie Insurance, which practically screamed, “We don’t want your business.” Their rates were 89% and 44% more than her current premium. They came closer to matching Ron’s rate, but not close enough.
The Brooklyn Storefront
After spending so much time online, we were ready for sustenance — and assistance from a warm-blooded human. After a pit stop at Lioni for excellent hero sandwiches, we visited one of those old-school storefronts, this one in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn. It had several desks filled with piles of paper, but humans were visible, burrowed in behind the stacks.
We introduced ourselves as reporters from The New York Times and met an insurance agent, with more than three decades of experience, who said she would try to assist us. Given the current rates in the market, she wasn’t terribly optimistic. She told us that she had never seen anything like this before — and found it depressing.
The good part about most humans is that they will level with you in a way that a robot won’t. Right away, the agent raised her eyebrows and told Ron that USAA was going to be hard to beat. She didn’t even think it was worthwhile to offer him a quote.
Not everyone can get USAA auto insurance in the first place, since only members of the military, most former members, eligible family and a few other limited groups of people can apply. (We thank Ron’s late father, Fred, for his service.)
The agent did generate a solid rate for Tara from Travelers, but GEICO still had the edge.
So after all of that, we are back where we started. Ron is weighing his feelings about USAA’s watching him. Tara is contemplating the wisdom of reducing her coverage.
Industry professionals were not that surprised that we couldn’t save money, given what it costs insurers to buy car parts and pay for people to install them.
“Inflation impacted everyone, all at once,” said Dale Porfilio, chief insurance officer at the Insurance Information Institute.

Outcry Over a City's Welcome Mat to Refugees: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Eau Claire had a plan. But opponents, mostly from rural areas, were convinced that the newcomers would destroy their Midwestern way of life.
The billboards featured a foreboding message. Taxpayer money, it said, was footing the bill for a nonprofit to traffic Somali refugees -- and officials in Eau Claire, Wis., had been hiding the facts for months.
When the City Council president, Emily Berge, saw the false accusations plastered last October above a thoroughfare in this river-crossed Midwestern city, her heart sank.
"I was shocked such claims would be made," Ms. Berge said. "It was so xenophobic, and not at all what we stand for as a community."
Xenophobic? "Hardly," said Matthew Bocklund, an avid supporter of former President Donald J. Trump and an activist who helped raise funds for the billboards.
The message, he said, "got people to wake up and realize what was really going on."
The billboards marked the beginning of a searing monthslong battle in central and western Wisconsin over 75 refugees, mostly from countries in central Africa. Each one had been vetted, often for years, and then invited by the federal government to come to the United States. An evangelical nonprofit would help them settle, at least initially, in Eau Claire, a predominantly white, liberal-leaning city of 70,000, surrounded by a conservative swath of rural Wisconsin.
Standing against the resettlement: a loud protest group, dozens strong, made up in part of evangelical Christians, who said cities and states should be able to say no to refugees coming to their communities.
Often deploying selective facts and misinformation, they insisted the resettlement was unlawful and founded with ill intent, and that the refugees would bring a rise in crime, disease and disorder -- along with Shariah law.
At the heart of their manifold arguments: a skepticism of all immigration that frequently bleeds into anger and abhorrence.
"I don't want to live in a third-world hellhole," one protester said at a public gathering.
Their feverish opposition reflects how much Mr. Trump has turbocharged the issue of immigration over the last eight years. Just this month, he repeated the false, outlandish claim that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, had eaten their neighbors' pets. At a recent campaign stop in Eau Claire, the Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance refused to back away from those assertions and doubled down on support for mass deportations.
No doubt, Mr. Vance's comments resonated with the anti-immigrant protesters in this swing state, where turnout and enthusiasm are crucial, and which could be decided by the thinnest of margins.
Refugee resettlement has never been easy. But last year in Eau Claire, officials at city hall and at World Relief, the Christian nonprofit working with the refugees, were stunned to find their efforts threatened not just by local residents worried about the effects on neighborhoods but by a faction of vocal opponents, many of whom lived in rural areas outside the city.
Nothing could ease their distrust. They were unmoved by supportive proclamations, reminders that the refugees had been vetted and were coming to Wisconsin legally, or studies on the economic or cultural benefits.
And nothing could shake their conviction that the resettlement of refugees was part of a conspiracy intended to destroy their Midwestern way of life.
"They are working America as a kind of jihad," one commenter claimed in a public meeting, adding that Muslim immigrants were "eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within."
Travis Albrecht, lead pastor at Valleybrook Church in Eau Claire, which supported the newcomers, described his city as a place where "a family has a tragedy and people show up with a meal."
He added: "A tree is blown down in your yard, people offer to help. A car breaks down, it's like, 'Hey, you can borrow mine."'
But the controversy laid bare another truth.
"Wisconsin is a complex place, and Eau Claire is complex," Mr. Albrecht said. "It has quite a mix between rural life and city life. It is changing, and I think a lot of people are afraid of change."
Rallying the Opposition
In October, a television station aired a news report highlighting the plan to resettle refugees in Eau Claire.
The segment was positive, but it ignited a firestorm.
Mr. Bocklund went into action. After a meeting at a V.F.W. hall packed with critics of the resettlement, he organized what he called the Refugee Summit. The billboards went up. And picketers demonstrated outside a library where World Relief representatives described their plan.
Public meetings in Eau Claire and nearby counties began drawing overflow crowds.
Protesters questioned whether refugees should receive government assistance.
Each refugee would receive federal support of about $ 1,325 for the first 90 days. Many were eligible for additional government money: about $ 600 a month for a year in most cases, and for some, up to five years.
Eau Claire, the opposition pointed out, had a growing homeless population. Housing costs have gone up. Two of the areas's hospitals were soon to close. What about all that?
Many were also clearly fearful.
In February, at a packed supervisors' board meeting in Chippewa County, which includes a small portion of Eau Claire, a swath of resettlement opponents conflated the legal refugees with undocumented immigrants arriving by foot over the Mexican or Canadian borders.
One speaker wondered if the federal government might soon bring thousands of other refugees. "You can see what's happening," he added -- just look at the southern border, where the federal government wants "as many people to come in as possible."
He urged his fellow citizens to stand up.
"Chippewa County," he vowed, "is not going to become an open border state."
Those who supported the new arrivals -- most likely the majority view in liberal Eau Claire -- rose to the dais to state their case, but on this night, they were outnumbered.
To their advocates and city officials, Eau Claire seems like an ideal destination for the refugees.
In a state plagued by population loss, the city is steadily growing and gaining a reputation for livability. Crime isn't much of a problem: In 2023, the Police Department reported eight robberies -- and no murders. Eau Claire has a campus of the University of Wisconsin system and a community college ready to train workers.
Municipal officials in the city, which is nearly 90 percent white, want to attract more diversity and build up the work force.
There are problems in Eau Claire, said Scott Rogers, vice president of government affairs at the local chamber of commerce.
But "work force is the No. 1 issue," he said. "We don't have enough people."
The Refugees Arrive
Immigrating under the Refugee Act of 1980 is no easy feat.
Roughly three million people have come to the United States under the law, which was passed with bipartisan support.
The State Department handpicks potential refugees, with preference given to these most in danger or need. Refugees go through screenings -- interviews, cross-checks, medical exams and background investigations -- that take, on average, 18 months to two years.
The government works with nonprofits such as World Relief, which assumes responsibility for helping the newcomers find education, housing and jobs.
Ms. Berge, a mental health counselor who doubles as the leading elected official in a city without a mayor, said the protests and fear had worn on her.
"There were people calling me from 90 miles away," she said, "because their grandson goes to the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, and they're scared. Or they don't have any connection to Eau Claire, but they don't want 'those people' here."
Ms. Berge said she told one protester that his opinion might change if he volunteered and met the newcomers. The man, she said, shot back, "I'll volunteer to help them pack up their bags and go home!"
Dozens of Eau Claire residents did volunteer, forming teams to welcome the refugees, who began to trickle in by February. The volunteers showed their new neighbors how the bus and school systems worked, where to find an apartment and shop for groceries, and how best to blend in.
"I don't think those who are so upset about this really understand that they are talking about people," said one of the volunteers, Dorie Fink. "If they understood the person, knew their story, I can't believe they would say those hurtful, fearful things."
Kesiya and her family had fled the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2008, eventually finding safety in a refugee camp in Zimbabwe. For 16 years, her family had lived in that camp, enough time for her to mature from a girl in grade school into a 26-year-old woman.
The seemingly endless wait included a final hard stretch of five years, during which Kesiya, her mother, her father and her three young sisters were repeatedly screened by the State Department.
In a recent interview, she spoke of how the future had darkened as time pushed forward in the camp.
Would a country take them in? If not, how would they survive such a forsaken place?
Finally in February, they flew from Zimbabwe to Chicago, and then to Minneapolis, before being driven to Eau Claire. Her family quickly rented a three-bedroom townhouse.
In America, Kesiya said, everything is so bright and unexpectedly beautiful.
The buildings.
The cars.
A bedroom room of her own, a stocked refrigerator -- and ice cream. "Oh my God, vanilla ice cream!" she said.
Kesiya said she knew little about the refugee controversy and believed that was for the best. But she knows to be careful. The Times agreed not to publish her last name to protect her in an environment that has put normally placid Eau Claire on edge.
'Get Them Out of the Country'
During the pandemic, Mr. Bocklund became a prime mover for a faction of hard-right conservatives and patriot groups that began making waves in western Wisconsin.
A 46-year-old financial planner who served two years, starting in 2021, as chair of the Republican Party in St. Croix County, Mr. Bocklund is hard to miss.
He drives down country roads in the "Freedom Tank," as he calls it: his dented 22-year-old Toyota Avalon -- festooned with bumper stickers hailing Mr. Trump, gun rights, the anti-abortion movement and Jesus Christ. He stops at roadsides to pound Trump 2024 signs into the ground or to wade through pastures to affix a Trump placard on a grain silo.
At other times, dressed in a business suit and a crisp, white dress shirt with a red tie, he argues for MAGA causes at city council and school board meetings, parades and county fairs.
The anti-refugee organizing campaign he helps lead has had an effect. Representative Tom Tiffany, a Republican who has been critical of President Biden's handling of the border, introduced a bill in Congress in February to give states and local governments power to reject future refugee placements.
In a series of conversations, including one over a meal at a Denny's diner near his small town church, Mr. Bocklund explained his opinions and how they had formed.
Married with four children, he grew up in St. Paul, Minn., in a home full of Democrats.
For decades, he had little interest in anything political.
Then in 2016, he watched Mr. Trump in a Republican primary debate.
"Incredible," Mr. Bocklund said. "He had the command of that stage. You knew that when he became president, he was willing to stand by himself against all enemies. He was going to be resolute."
Fired up by what he heard and saw, Mr. Bocklund went all in.
These days, he rarely gets his political information from news articles. "I don't like reading," he said. Instead, he devours conservative cable shows. "It's on all the time," he said, even on his phone while he drives. He said he takes in shows from Fox News and Newsmax, as well as "yes, believe it or not, CNN," though he said most of the network's anchors tend to turn his stomach.
The right-wing firebrand Tucker Carlson is a favorite, as is the podcaster Joe Rogan. One of the politicians he most admires is Byron Donalds, the Trump-supporting Black congressman from Florida.
Much of what he believes to be true, he noted, comes from his Facebook feed and YouTube videos. But mostly, he said, he does his own research and draws his own conclusions.
His sleuthing has led Mr. Bocklund to conclude the legal refugee system must be halted.
As for undocumented immigrants, "get them out of the country," he said, so we can "get our cities back in order."
Only then, he said, can a new immigration system be born.
A believer, "full stop," in Mr. Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, Mr. Bocklund also believes that the refugee program is part of a conspiracy to alter the politics of the country.
A Democratic operative, he said, is going to find the places to bring in refugees where the party wants the voting patterns to change -- "where there's too much conservative red-leaning MAGA."
He added: "What's the likelihood that they haven't figured out a way to tell these people how to vote? Or, furthermore, go get them fake credentials so they could be able to vote?"
(Newcomers arriving under the Refugee Act are initially classified as lawfully present and are required to apply for permanent resident status one year after arrival. They cannot cast ballots until becoming citizens, a process that takes years.)
Reminded of the billboard's claims, Mr. Bocklund did not back down. Yes, he insisted, refugees are being trafficked by the federal government and the nonprofits.
"What's the difference," he asked, between refugee relocation "and slavery?"
He answered his own question: They are actually quite similar, he claimed. "The people who brought back slaves to the ship, they got paid," he said. "The ship goes back, sails back to the Cape of Africa, and brings more people."
He distrusts most institutions. He claims that the federal government and nonprofits exploit refugees by pushing them to work low-wage jobs. He also claims refugees are somehow forced to send their earnings back home to fulfill the global sustainability goals of the United Nations.
Want additional proof to back up many of his theories? He carries a stack of documents. Need even more evidence? Easy, he said.
"You can watch it on YouTube."
The Next Round
By late August, all of the refugees had arrived in Eau Claire.
Most hailed from central Africa, others from Colombia, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Afghanistan. Five came from Somalia and relocated to Barron, a rural town about an hour's drive north of Eau Claire, where Somalis immigrants began settling in the 1990s.
Barron is a favorite target of the critics, who say it has collapsed under the weight of the refugees.
"I don't know why folks outside of here are pointing at Barron," said Dave Armstrong, a Republican member of the State Legislature who represents the city. The immigrants not only bolster the overall economy, he said, but are among Barron's most law-abiding citizens. "I don't see issues."
In Eau Claire, the roughly two dozen new children in town prepared for school.
The adults found apartments and jobs. They worked late-night shifts stocking shelves at grocery stores, and they assembled fasteners at a manufacturing plant. One with particularly good English skills was hired as an interpreter.
For her part, Kesiya recalled hearing the news that her family would move to the United States. It felt like a dream, she said, as if God had touched them.
"Suddenly, you're an American," she said, eyes widening. "People call you an American. Yes! Yes!"
World Relief says it plans to bring up to 125 more refugees next year to Eau Claire.
The opposition has plans, too. The supervisors' boards in the western Wisconsin counties of St. Croix and Chippewa have pushed forward resolutions asking for a pause on refugee immigration.
"The next step," Mr. Bocklund said, "is to pass resolutions in counties across the state."

At Stellantis, The Troubles Are Piling Up: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The automaker, created by a 2021 merger, is dealing with labor unrest, slumping sales and a revolt from its dealers.
Stellantis, an automotive colossus that owns more than a dozen brands including Chrysler, Fiat, Jeep, Peugeot and Ram, is facing challenges at seemingly every turn.
The company's sales and profit have been plummeting. Dealers stuck with parking lots filled with unsold cars are publicly criticizing Stellantis and its chief executive in unusually harsh terms. Stellantis's stock price has fallen almost 50 percent from its high point in March. And the union that represents its U.S. factory workers is threatening to go on strike at several plants.
United Automobile Workers locals are expected to vote in the coming days to authorize strikes against several Stellantis factories, protesting what they say are broken promises by the automaker.
The problems are raising questions about the future of Carlos Tavares, the Stellantis chief executive, who races cars in his spare time. After taking the reins at the French carmaker PSA in 2014, he acquired a series of rivals to build a company that last year sold more cars than General Motors did.
Last week, Stellantis said it was evaluating who should lead the company when Mr. Tavares's contract expires in early 2026. Mr. Tavares could remain chief executive, Stellantis said, but the statement was hardly a vote of confidence.
In 2021, PSA merged with Fiat Chrysler, and the combined company adopted the name Stellantis. While the company is based in Amsterdam, its U.S. operations accounted for more than half of Stellantis's profit in the first six months of 2024, meaning that problems here reverberate across the Atlantic. And the problems are deep, analyst say.
"I wouldn't want to be Carlos Tavares," said Erin Keating, the senior director of economic and industry insights at Cox Automotive, a market research firm.
Jeep and other Stellantis brands raised prices more than other automakers did in recent years, Ms. Keating said, and waited longer to offer discounts when demand slowed. High interest rates made those prices even more unpalatable to car buyers. As a result, many people who are ready to trade in Jeep Wagoneers or Dodge Chargers that they bought three or four years ago can't afford the latest models.
Dodge dealers have, on average, 149 days of supply on lots, including many 2023 models, according to Cox. That is almost twice the industry average. Market share of Stellantis brands in the United States had fallen to 8.6 percent as of the end of June from 10.4 percent a year earlier, Cox said.
Dealers are furious. Kevin Farrish, the chairman of the Stellantis National Dealer Council, which represents the company's independent car dealers, blamed decisions that favored short-term profits and helped Mr. Tavares qualify for a 50 percent pay raise last year, earning nearly $ 40 million.
"The reckless short-term decision-making to secure record profits in 2023 has had devastating, yet entirely predictable, consequences in the U.S. market," Mr. Farrish and other members of the council wrote in a letter to Mr. Tavares this month. "Those consequences include the rapid degradation of our iconic American brands."
"You created this problem," the dealers wrote in an unusually direct rebuke.
Stellantis declined to make Mr. Tavares available for an interview. In a statement, the company said his compensation was in line with other automotive chief executives', taking into account corporate profits.
The president of the U.A.W., Shawn Fain, has been just as strident in his criticism of Mr. Tavares, accusing him of backpedaling on promises to revive operations at a shuttered factory in Belvidere, Ill., and of planning to move production of the Dodge Durango, a large sport utility vehicle, from Detroit to Canada.
"Either we allow an out-of-control C.E.O. and his billionaire backers who have enjoyed years of record profits to close plant after plant and continue destroying our country," Mr. Fain told union members last week, "or we stand up."
The confrontation between Stellantis and the U.A.W. comes a year after strikes helped workers win record pay raises. As part of the contract that ended those strikes, workers won the right to walk out if the company didn't meet its commitments -- a right that the union is now threatening to invoke.
The company denied that it was violating any commitments to the U.A.W., and said it had not confirmed plans to move Durango production.
"Stellantis has abided, and will continue to abide, by the agreement the parties reached in 2023," Carlos Zarlenga, the chief operating officer of Stellantis North America, said in an email to Mr. Fain on Monday.
The problems at Stellantis raise doubts about the series of acquisitions during the last decade that made it the fourth-largest carmaker after Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai-Kia. (Stellantis is fifth if the alliance of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi is considered one company.)
The deal-making led by Mr. Tavares was supposed to allow the company's car brands to share the costs of developing new technology and save money by using common components. The rationale was that bigger carmakers had a better chance of surviving the upheaval caused by the industry's shift to electric vehicles and autonomous driving.
Those benefits have not materialized as much as the company hoped, analysts said. The company disagreed, saying in a statement that combining the automakers had saved $ 8 billion since 2019.
Stellantis offers a wide selection of midsize and small cars in Europe. In the United States, however, Jeep's model lineup is heavy on higher-priced, large sport utility vehicles after it discontinued the smaller Cherokee and Renegade models last year. That change came just as cost-conscious buyers began showing a preference for smaller S.U.V.s like the Toyota RAV4, Chevrolet Trax and Honda CR-V.
And Stellantis has been unable to arrest the decline of Chrysler, which began decades ago and was once a formidable rival to Chevrolet and Ford Motor. Chrysler's lineup has dwindled to one vehicle -- the Pacifica minivan, which is available as a plug-in hybrid or with a conventional gasoline engine. (Chrysler is still selling off remaining inventory of the 300 sedan, which it stopped producing last year.)
Stellantis said it was taking steps to regain market share, including cutting the starting price of its least expensive model, the Jeep Compass, to below $ 30,000. The company said this week that it would revive the Chrysler Voyager minivan with a starting price of $ 40,000, slightly less than the least expensive Pacifica. The new Voyager will go on sale at the end of this year.
Bigger discounts for models like the Ram 1500 Classic pickup helped Stellantis sales in the United States and Canada surge 20 percent in August, the company said.
Still, with so many unsold vehicles, Stellantis faces pressure to throttle production and cut jobs, "which is obviously upsetting to the U.A.W.," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry analytics and insights at CarGurus, a car shopping website.
Dealers complain that the company does not have a clear strategy.
"Our businesses are suffering. Our employees are suffering," said Sean Hogan, the vice president of Sierra Auto Group, which owns Stellantis dealerships in Los Angeles. "We're not seeing a plan to bring us back to a volume we once had."
Mr. Hogan, also the secretary of the company's dealer council, said he met with top Stellantis executives on Monday but was not satisfied by what he heard. The automaker is still not offering incentives that are generous enough to increase sales and allow dealers to make a decent profit, he said in an email.
Mr. Fain, the U.A.W. president, told members that at least one union local would hold a strike authorization vote soon. Under the terms of the contract with Stellantis, the union would be obligated to meet at least seven times with management to try to resolve its grievances. A strike would happen only if the talks were unsuccessful.
In the short term, factory shutdowns by striking workers may be a blessing in disguise for Stellantis, buying time to clear dealer lots of unsold vehicles. But the company would also risk damaging its brands by alienating car buyers who are sympathetic to union demands.
"Labor unrest is never good," Ms. Keating of Cox Automotive said.

A Wisconsin City Welcomed New Refugees. Then the Angry Billboards Went Up.

EAU CLAIRE, Wis. — The billboards featured a foreboding message. Taxpayer money, it said, was footing the bill for a nonprofit to traffic Somali refugees — and officials in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, had been hiding the facts for months.
When the City Council president, Emily Berge, saw the false accusations plastered in October above a thoroughfare in this river-crossed Midwestern city, her heart sank.
“I was shocked such claims would be made,” Berge said. “It was so xenophobic, and not at all what we stand for as a community.”
Xenophobic? “Hardly,” said Matthew Bocklund, an avid supporter of former President Donald Trump’s and an activist who helped raise funds for the billboards.
The message, he said, “got people to wake up and realize what was really going on.”
The billboards marked the beginning of a searing monthslong battle in central and western Wisconsin over 75 refugees, mostly from countries in central Africa. Each one had been vetted and then invited by the federal government to come to the United States. An evangelical nonprofit would help them settle, at least initially, in Eau Claire, a predominantly white, liberal-leaning city of 70,000, surrounded by a conservative swath of rural Wisconsin.
Standing against the resettlement: a loud protest group, dozens strong, made up in part of evangelical Christians, who said cities and states should be able to say no to refugees coming to their communities.
Often deploying selective facts and misinformation, they insisted the resettlement was unlawful and founded with ill intent, and that the refugees would bring a rise in crime, disease and disorder — along with Shariah law.
At the heart of their manifold arguments: a skepticism of all immigration that frequently bleeds into anger and abhorrence.
“I don’t want to live in a Third World hellhole,” one protester said at a public gathering.
Refugee resettlement has never been easy. But last year in Eau Claire, officials at city hall and at World Relief, a Christian nonprofit working with the refugees, were stunned to find their efforts threatened not just by local residents worried about the effects on neighborhoods but by a faction of vocal opponents, many of whom lived in rural areas outside the city.
Nothing could ease their distrust. They were unmoved by supportive proclamations, reminders that the refugees had been vetted and were coming to Wisconsin legally, or studies on the economic or cultural benefits.
Travis Albrecht, lead pastor at Valleybrook Church in Eau Claire, which supported the newcomers, described his city as a place where “a family has a tragedy and people show up with a meal.”
Rallying the Opposition
In October, a television station aired a news report highlighting the plan to resettle refugees in Eau Claire.
The segment was positive, but it ignited a firestorm.
Bocklund went into action. After a meeting at a VFW hall packed with critics of the resettlement, he organized what he called the Refugee Summit. The billboards went up. And picketers demonstrated outside a library where World Relief representatives described their plan.
Public meetings in Eau Claire and nearby counties began drawing overflow crowds.
Protesters questioned whether refugees should receive government assistance.
Each refugee would receive federal support of about $1,325 for the first 90 days. Many were eligible for additional government money.
Eau Claire, the opposition pointed out, had a growing homeless population. Housing costs have gone up. Two of the area’s hospitals were soon to close. What about all that?
Many were also clearly fearful.
In February, at a packed supervisors board meeting in Chippewa County, which includes a small portion of Eau Claire, a swath of resettlement opponents conflated the legal refugees with immigrants living in the country illegally who arrived by foot over the Mexican or Canadian borders.
The Refugees Arrive
Immigrating under the Refugee Act of 1980 is no easy feat.
Roughly 3 million people have come to the United States under the law.
The State Department handpicks potential refugees, with preference given to these most in danger or need. Refugees go through screenings that take, on average, 18 months to two years.
The government works with nonprofits such as World Relief, which assumes responsibility for helping the newcomers find education, housing and jobs.
Kesiya and her family, who live in Eau Claire, had fled the civil war in Congo in 2008, eventually finding safety in a refugee camp in Zimbabwe. For 16 years, her family had lived in that camp, enough time for her to mature from a girl in grade school into a 26-year-old woman.
The seemingly endless wait included a final hard stretch of five years, during which Kesiya, her mother, her father and her three young sisters were repeatedly screened by the State Department.
Kesiya said she knew little about the refugee controversy and believed that was for the best. But she knows to be careful.
‘Get Them Out of the Country’
During the pandemic, Bocklund became a prime mover for a faction of hard-right conservatives and patriot groups.
A 46-year-old financial planner who served two years as chair of the Republican Party in St. Croix County, Bocklund is hard to miss.
He drives down country roads in the “Freedom Tank,” as he calls it: his dented 22-year-old Toyota Avalon — festooned with bumper stickers hailing Trump, gun rights, the anti-abortion movement and Jesus Christ. He stops at roadsides to pound “Trump 2024” signs into the ground or to wade through pastures to affix a Trump placard on a grain silo.
At other times, dressed in a business suit and a crisp, white dress shirt with a red tie, he argues for MAGA causes at city council and school board meetings, parades and county fairs.
The anti-refugee organizing campaign he helps lead has had an effect. Rep. Tom Tiffany, R-Wis., who has been critical of President Joe Biden’s handling of the border, introduced a bill in Congress in February to give states and local governments power to reject future refugee placements.
Married with four children, Bocklund grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota, in a home full of Democrats.
For decades, he had little interest in anything political.
Then in 2016, he watched Trump in a Republican primary debate.
“Incredible,” Bocklund said. “He had the command of that stage. You knew that when he became president, he was willing to stand by himself against all enemies. He was going to be resolute.”
Fired up by what he heard and saw, Bocklund went all in.
As for immigrants living in the United States illegally, “get them out of the country,” he said, so we can “get our cities back in order.”
Only then, he said, can a new immigration system be born.
A believer, “full stop,” in Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, Bocklund also believes that the refugee program is part of a conspiracy to alter the politics of the country.
The Next Round
By late August, all of the refugees had arrived in Eau Claire.
Most hailed from central Africa, others from Colombia, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Afghanistan. Five came from Somalia and relocated to Barron, a rural town about an hour’s drive north of Eau Claire.
In Eau Claire, the roughly two dozen new children in town prepared for school.
The adults found apartments and jobs. They worked late-night shifts stocking shelves at grocery stores, and they assembled fasteners at a manufacturing plant.
World Relief says it plans to bring up to 125 more refugees next year to Eau Claire.
The opposition has plans, too. The supervisors boards in the western Wisconsin counties of St. Croix and Chippewa have pushed forward resolutions asking for a pause on refugee immigration.
“The next step,” Bocklund said, “is to pass resolutions in counties across the state.”

For European Clubs, Growing More English Has Its Advantages: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Such is the hold the Premier League has on the popular consciousness that enticing a player away from it is seen as a coup.
Atlético Madrid had pulled out all the stops to celebrate its new signing: strobing lasers and sparkling fireworks and, for reasons that were not entirely clear, a couple of thrumming motorcycles. Standing in the middle of it all, waving happily at the crowd, Conor Gallagher seemed just a little dazed.
He had, after all, spent most of the last two years being treated essentially as a balance-sheet asset by Chelsea, the club where he had spent most of his career. He had fought for, and won, a place on the team. He had, at times, served as its captain. He had played for England. And still, Chelsea just kept trying to sell him.
And now, before he had even kicked a ball for the team he had eventually joined, a thousand miles from home in Spain, he was being feted as a star. He wore a broad, faintly startled grin and an Atlético jersey with his name on the back. There was just one element he did not understand: Why did the club keep referring to him as El Pit Bull?
Several players have been granted that nickname by the club over the years. Gary Medel, the combative Chilean midfielder who once claimed that the police had used a Taser on him after a particularly fractious game, for example. Or Edgar Davids, the Dutchman given the moniker because of his tenacious man-marking: Once he had locked in, the logic went, he just would not let go.
Gallagher is, it is fair to say, cast in a very different mold. He is not -- as Medel and Davids were, in very different ways and, although you would not say it to Medel's face, at very different levels -- a player defined by his ferocity. The 24-year-old Gallagher's primary traits are his energy, his industry, his indefatigability. He is not a pit bull. He is a springer spaniel, or perhaps a Labrador.
Atlético, though, had its nickname, and it was not going to give it up easily. Gallagher's signing was trailed with a graphic of a pit bull, complete with leather jacket and spiked collar, in the style of a 4Chan meme. It was mentioned in the midst of his operatic unveiling. The fans have picked it up and run with it. "It has kind of stuck," Gallagher has said. "I don't mind. I see it as a compliment."
It is meant as one. From the perspective of the Premier League, the spectacle of his presentation to Atlético's fans last month seemed just a little overblown. By common consensus in England, Gallagher is a perfectly serviceable midfielder: hard-running and endlessly willing, but hardly a superstar.
He first came to prominence during a loan spell at Crystal Palace a couple of years ago; most observers would, at least tacitly, suggest that was a reasonably natural fit.
That he was deemed worthy of such pomp and ceremony in Spain, and that he has immediately become a central figure at one of the country's most celebrated teams -- two goals already, and most likely a pivotal role in this weekend's Madrid derby -- neatly encapsulates the current reality of European soccer's landscape.
Such is the hold the Premier League has on the popular consciousness that, even in one of Europe's other major leagues, enticing a player away from it is seen as a coup. Atlético's fans were not skeptical about signing a player who had been deemed surplus to requirements by Chelsea, a team not even in the Champions League. They were, instead, enthralled by the arrival of an emissary from what is perceived as the finest domestic tournament on the planet.
The choice of nickname, for all its dubious accuracy, was telling, too. There are many ways to understand the rise of the Premier League over the last 30 years. It is a story of finance, media, developing technology, the power of marketing, the importance of language and, to some extent, kind of about soccer, too.
As much as anything, though, it is a story of trade. In the 1990s, English soccer found that its great leap into the future, bankrolled by broadcast money, was being hamstrung by a problem of history: It could not conceivably live up to its claim of being the best league in the world if, technically, its players were so obviously inferior to their foreign counterparts.
And so, with the impatience that is typical of insurgent businesses, it set about rectifying that shortfall, partly by spending time and money on improving how it produced soccer players, but mainly by buying better ones from abroad.
The Premier League was flooded with imports. First came veteran players, a little past their sell-by dates. Then the hopefuls, and then genuine stars. After a while, coaches and scouts and development staff members all started to follow. Now, the technical level of a Premier League game is essentially indistinguishable from a game in La Liga or Serie A. Often, it is notably higher.
But while it is largely true that the Premier League is no longer an English competition in any tangible way -- it is a global contest that just so happens to be staged on a wet island not too far from the top left bit of Europe -- it retains distinctly English elements. The pace at which it is played, most obviously. A slightly higher bar for what might constitute a foul. And a particular appreciation for the benefits of the physical side of the sport.
Those attributes, of course, are precisely what drew Atlético to Gallagher. In the course of his early games for his new team, it is the intensity of his play, his dynamism, that his coach, Diego Simeone, has singled out for praise. Gallagher has been brought to Spain to add a dash not of Premier League artistry, but of industry.
He is not alone in that. That the clubs of Germany's Bundesliga have long seen England, in particular, as a source of undervalued young talent is well-known, and the most garlanded graduate of that particular pathway, Jude Bellingham, will face Gallagher while wearing the white of Real Madrid on Sunday.
But rather less publicized has been Italy's gradual drift toward Scotland. Bologna, Empoli and Torino all have Scottish players on their books. Napoli added two of its own this summer, in Billy Gilmour and Scott McTominay -- the latter just as much an embodiment of Premier League virtues as Gallagher.
Like Atlético, Napoli -- helped by its coach, Antonio Conte, a Premier League veteran himself -- has effectively recognized the modern reality of European soccer. England remains a net importer of talent. But there is no better gauge of its supremacy than the fact that it has started to export its products, too.
Those teams who wish to compete with its clubs have started to recognize that the world has turned almost full circle. The Premier League became the brand it is by becoming more international, by adding finesse and elegance to its blood and thunder. Those are the qualities that its rivals crave now. To be successful, now, is to be just a little more British.
Cassandra
As a piece of scripting, it was just a little on the nose. A few days after suggesting -- admirably -- that the world's elite players might have to go on strike to get the game's authorities to take seriously complaints about their ever-expanding workload, Rodri, the finest midfielder on the planet, sustained a serious injury to his right knee.
Pep Guardiola, his coach, said on Friday that Rodri would miss the rest of the season after surgery on the knee. That is a blow for City, of course.
It feels a bit melodramatic to suggest that Rodri might have had some sort of premonition about an imminent serious injury, but having spoken to plenty of players, male and female, who have endured long-term layoffs, they sincerely believe there is a link to fatigue. Being tired makes you more vulnerable. That is the point Rodri was making. It is one that will carry more weight with every game he misses.
Two Heads Are Not Better Than One
There is salvation on the horizon, at last, for Everton. After more than two years of genuine doubt about its viability as an ongoing concern, the club has a glimmer of hope.
Pending the approval of various regulatory bodies, Everton will soon be free from the inept ownership of Farhad Moshiri -- and lingering uncertainty about a mysterious American suitor -- and brought under the umbrella of the Friedkin Group, a name that will be familiar to a) fans of A.S. Roma and b) anyone who has bought a Toyota in Texas in the last few decades.
The Friedkins, Dan and Ryan, would not typically be the sort of owners who would bring fans onto the streets wearing Stetsons, pinning bluebonnets to their lapels and lobbing hunks of chicken-fried steak* into the air. They are not sugar daddies, not in the Newcastle or Manchester City sense. Their record at Roma is respectable, but not spectacular.
For Everton's fans, though, they are a blessed, welcome relief, a guarantee that their club will remain. The doubt, now, has transferred to Roma. The Friedkins were quick to release a statement insisting that the "potential acquisition of Everton in no way changes our commitment to Roma." The Italian club "remains at the heart of our football ambitions."
That may be true, but the perception will be quite different. Every dollar spent on Everton will be seen as a dollar not spent on Roma. Every success enjoyed by Everton will be a success denied to Roma. (And, of course, vice versa.) That may not be true, of course. But it will be what the fans feel to be true, and that is probably more important.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nadia Milleron, an independent candidate for Congress, slipped off her shoes and climbed onto the bench of a picnic table. It was a muggy August evening, and gnats and mosquitoes were swarming the 50 or so people who had gathered for a campaign event in the garden behind a pizzeria in western Massachusetts.
Ms. Milleron was nervous. A neophyte candidate, she was trying to unseat one of the most powerful Democrats in Congress. That afternoon, she had twice rehearsed her short stump speech. In the barn next to her farmhouse, she had spent 10 minutes paddling a Ping-Pong ball against a makeshift backboard, a routine she had developed to ease her jitters.
She knew she faced long odds. But she also knew she had a potent weapon: her story.
Ms. Milleron had spent the last five years on a grief-powered crusade against an iconic but troubled American company, against regulatory inertia, against a legal system that she felt was intent on thwarting her. She had been inspired and at times directed by her uncle, the consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
If there was one core belief that animated the extended Nader family, it was this: Never underestimate the ability of tireless citizen activists to change the world. Ms. Milleron's underdog journey seemed to validate that conviction. And her run for Congress was to her about more than politics. She was fulfilling a family obligation -- and channeling anger and sadness that might otherwise overwhelm her.
"We thought as a family that someone ought to challenge Richard Neal," her local congressman, Ms. Milleron told the small crowd outside Roberto's Pizza in Sheffield, Mass. "I'm a lawyer, I've passed legislation, I've been effective." She urged her supporters to donate to her campaign.
Ms. Milleron was wearing a short-sleeved shirt and an ankle-length blue skirt. The skirt had belonged to her daughter. For a long time, it had carried the telltale scent of jet fuel.
A Jolt of Panic
Late one night in March 2019, Ms. Milleron awoke to the sound of retching. Her youngest son, Tor Stumo, was visiting from college, and he was sick.
Ms. Milleron, 54 at the time, wrapped Tor in a blanket, cleaned up his mess and started a load of laundry. She flipped on the radio. There was breaking news: An airliner had crashed shortly after takeoff from Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
This was not the kind of news that normally would have elicited much interest from Ms. Milleron. But her 24-year-old daughter, Samya Stumo, was flying that day out of Addis Ababa. Samya was just starting a career in public health. A couple of hours earlier, she had texted her family to let them know that she would soon be boarding her flight for Nairobi.
Ms. Milleron felt a jolt of panic. The room seemed to spin.
"Samya, did you make it to Nairobi?" she texted. "There was a plane crash." No response.
She talked to Mike Snavely, Samya's boyfriend, who helped figure out what flight she'd been on. It was Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. The plane that had crashed.
Ms. Milleron woke her husband, Michael Stumo, who told her it couldn't be true. He tried to go back to sleep. She shook him. "We have to go to Ethiopia," she said. Samya might be injured and need help.
Ms. Milleron, Mr. Stumo and Tor flew 12 hours to Qatar. Before they boarded their connecting flight to Addis Ababa, they learned that there were no survivors. They had all suspected it, and now they knew. Samya was dead.
In Ethiopia, a van dispatched by the U.S. Embassy drove the family to a hotel. Ms. Milleron, an Orthodox Christian, chanted a prayer: "Give rest to the soul of thy servant Samya." She hoped to bring her daughter's body back to the United States to be buried. But the plane, a new Boeing 737 Max jet, had dived into the ground at more than 500 miles per hour. There were no bodies.
The family had to wait a few days before they were permitted to visit the crash site, in a remote farming region. The plane had plowed a deep crater into the earth. Around it was a plume of debris: mangled metal and clothes and passports and cigarettes and airline-branded napkins.
Samya's boyfriend had joined the family in Addis Ababa. He curled on the ground in the fetal position, hugging himself and crying. Tor knelt by his side. Photographers started shooting pictures. Tor screamed at them to get away. It occurred to him later that having someone to be angry with made things a little easier.
He and Ms. Milleron wanted to see the plane's crater, to do something to honor Samya's final resting place. Rifle-wielding security guards tried to intercept them as they crossed the cordoned-off perimeter, but the two brushed past. Ms. Milleron was holding a large bouquet of white and red roses, and she threw them into the pit, one by one.
Dragged Into Action
Back home in Sheffield, Ms. Milleron couldn't sleep. She couldn't think. She crashed her car so many times that she stopped driving.
Her one respite was swimming. A river cut through their land, and Ms. Milleron would submerge herself in the ice-crusted water. For a few hours afterward, she could feel again.
It was Uncle Ralph who dragged her into action.
For decades, Mr. Nader had been America's foremost consumer watchdog, cajoling Congress to pass safety laws and create new government agencies to police companies. His successes inspired generations of "Nader's Raiders," though his star faded after the 2000 election, when many Democrats blamed his Green Party candidacy for delivering the White House to George W. Bush.
To his family, Mr. Nader was a beloved but irascible workaholic. He often snapped at Ms. Milleron's children for offenses such as chewing noisily. "He doesn't really give hugs," Tor said.
Yet his anti-corporate politics and nothing-is-impossible creed had been imprinted on relatives. Trying to change the world wasn't a suggestion; it was a family duty. As a young adult, Samya developed an interest in public health and regularly solicited her granduncle's advice. He appreciated that she focused their conversations on weighty matters. "Maybe she did small talk with other people, but not with me," he said.
The night before she flew to Africa, the pair had dinner -- lentils, pita, olives and onions -- at Mr. Nader's home in Washington. "I talked to her about not getting diseases," he recalled. "Don't take any chances" were his final words to her.
Mr. Nader, now 90, had first gained fame by railing against dangerous cars -- a campaign that led to the demise of two of America's most popular vehicles, the Chevrolet Corvair and the Ford Pinto. He developed an expertise in aviation safety, too. In 1993, he coauthored the book "Collision Course," which warned that federal deregulation of the airline industry endangered passengers.
Now, a quarter-century later, a plane crash had killed Samya and 156 others. He regretted that his attention had wavered. "We all should have been on top of it earlier," he said.
Mr. Nader refocused.
The Ethiopian Airlines flight was not the first crash of a 737 Max aircraft, a new breed of jet that Boeing had developed amid intense competitive pressure from its rival Airbus. Five months earlier, a Lion Air plane of the same make had plunged into the Java Sea minutes after taking off from Jakarta, killing everyone onboard. News reports quickly focused on troublesome software and faulty sensors that may have forced both jets into steep, fatal descents.
Within days of the Ethiopian crash, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded 737 Max planes.
Mr. Nader told Ms. Milleron and Mr. Stumo that they should sue Boeing. He helped them find lawyers, and on April 4, 2019, their wrongful-death lawsuit was filed in federal court in Illinois, where Boeing had its headquarters at the time.
Boeing, meanwhile, was racing to get the 737 Max jets back in the air. The F.A.A. appeared poised to let them. This struck Mr. Nader as a classic example of a regulator caving to a greedy corporation.
In his experience, few advocates were more powerful than grieving parents. Mr. Nader called his niece. "You can't spend the entire time crying," he told Ms. Milleron. "If you don't get up, there's going to be a third crash." He urged her to go to Washington and push lawmakers and regulators to keep the planes on the ground.
Ms. Milleron felt in no shape to get up. But she also felt that her uncle was right: She didn't really have a choice.
Nor did she know where to start. She had practiced as a court-appointed lawyer, but that was a long time ago, before she devoted herself to home-schooling her children. She talked to Mr. Stumo. He, too, needed an outlet for his grief, and he knew what to do. He ran a group, the Coalition for a Prosperous America, that lobbied for U.S. manufacturers and farmers. He began reaching out to contacts to arrange meetings on Capitol Hill and at the F.A.A. and the Department of Transportation.
Mr. Nader introduced Ms. Milleron to Paul Hudson, a longtime activist in the Nader network. He instructed her to get photos of the passengers on the doomed Boeing flights. Display them outside the Transportation Department and at congressional hearings. "You can talk, you can write, but a photograph people can relate to," he explained to her. "Make it real for them. Never be without those photographs."
Ms. Milleron began organizing the grieving families in a WhatsApp group. They gathered photos and pieced together the flight's seating chart. Samya, she learned, had been in seat 16J.
Meeting with senior officials at the Transportation Department, Mr. Stumo and Ms. Milleron argued that it was irresponsible for the F.A.A. to let the Boeing jets return to service without more research into the causes of the back-to-back crashes.
In June, the Trump administration decided that the planes would remain grounded indefinitely. Nearly two years would pass before they would fly again. It was Ms. Milleron's first inkling that perhaps she could make a difference.
The Moth
A few months after Samya's death, Ms. Milleron and some relatives traveled to Wolf Trap, a performing arts center outside Washington, D.C., to attend a Lebanese dance company's rendition of "One Thousand and One Nights." What should have been Samya's 25th birthday was approaching, and Ms. Milleron, who is of Lebanese descent, thought the show was the kind of thing her daughter would have wanted to see.
One of Ms. Milleron's cousins flew in from upstate New York. Outside Ronald Reagan National Airport, an enormous orange-and-black-striped moth attached itself to his shirt. The moth stayed on him for the drive to Wolf Trap. It remained through dinner at a restaurant. At the venue, a procession of strangers admired the unusual insect.
The dance performance began at 8 p.m. Ms. Milleron concluded that Samya would have considered the show exploitative. The moth, too, seemed unimpressed, flying off into the gathering dusk.
It was then that another cousin, having done some internet sleuthing, identified the type of moth. It was a Samia.
Ms. Milleron began to cry. She texted Mr. Snavely, Samya's boyfriend, about what she had just witnessed. "We were all overcome," she wrote.
"I'm glad that she is finding ways to make her presence felt," Mr. Snavely replied.
"Samya communicated with us and let us know she was fine," Ms. Milleron said recently as she gave a tour of her daughter's bedroom. It had been left largely untouched in the five-plus years since Samya's death. A piece of lined notebook paper -- on which Samya had written "If you try to wake me up before 8:30 I m̶a̶y̶ will kill you." -- remained taped to the door.
In the closet, a small stack of thin white boxes contained the few items of Samya's that workers had recovered from the airplane's wreckage, including her fuel-soaked clothes and passport. Ms. Milleron had taken one of those salvaged possessions, Samya's blue skirt, and hung it in her own closet.
'This Is Completely Useless'
The more Ms. Milleron learned about the problems with Boeing's aircraft, the more upset she became. In its haste to fend off Airbus, Boeing had been churning out planes with flawed software and poorly designed equipment, with little supervision from regulators. A rushed manufacturing process had compounded the problems -- not just with the 737 Max line of jets but with the company's 787 Dreamliner as well. Boeing employees had repeatedly alerted their superiors, to no avail.
Nothing would bring Samya back, but Ms. Milleron yearned for accountability.
She invited the other victims' families to join her on trips to Washington. They pressed lawmakers to hold hearings, to subpoena Boeing and its executives, to require the F.A.A. to more closely scrutinize the aircraft-manufacturing process.
Over the next several months, Ms. Milleron estimated, she visited 100 congressional offices. She and the relatives of other victims attended hearings, toting poster-size photos of their loved ones.
"Turn and look at people when you say you're sorry," Ms. Milleron called out at a 2019 hearing after the Boeing chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, directed his apologies to the lawmakers on the dais but not to the families in the audience.
Some New England lawmakers offered Ms. Milleron assistance and condolences; Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts sent flowers for Samya's funeral. Mr. Neal, however, met with Mr. Stumo only after Mr. Nader prodded the lawmaker's office. "I will never forget that I did not hear from my congressman around Samya's death," Ms. Milleron said.
At times, Ms. Milleron bumped into Boeing lobbyists wearing expensive-looking suits and seeming to enjoy unfettered access throughout the Capitol. "What am I doing?" she asked herself. "This is completely useless."
But lawmakers and their aides said her presence mattered, keeping up the pressure to act. In 2020, Congress passed the Aircraft Certification Safety and Accountability Act, requiring the F.A.A. to better supervise plane manufacturing and onboard safety systems.
Douglas Pasternak, a congressional aide who led a House investigation into Boeing, said that as he grilled Boeing executives, he found himself thinking of Ms. Milleron. She "was definitely in the back of my head," he said. "This wasn't just an investigation about Boeing. It was also about a human tragedy."
One day, between meetings in the Hart Senate Office Building, Ms. Milleron got a phone call from an unknown number in Ethiopia. The person on the line informed her that the authorities had finished the process of identifying human remains from the crash. They had found 122 pieces of Samya's body and wanted to know what to do with them. Ms. Milleron's knees buckled.
The Priest's Warning
Ms. Milleron and Mr. Stumo had grieved before. Twenty years earlier, they had lost another child, their 2-year-old son, to cancer.
Ms. Milleron's priest warned her at the time that parents who suffer such a loss often end up getting divorced. She and Mr. Stumo struggled, but Ms. Milleron did not believe in divorce.
In some ways, they were better equipped to handle the second tragedy. "We're not blaming each other," she said. "I think we have more of an understanding for the way the other person" processes grief.
Mr. Stumo was sitting by a window overlooking a flower garden that Ms. Milleron had planted in Samya's honor. Did he agree with his wife? He hesitated and took a small bite of a Twix bar. "I don't know," he eventually said, and his eyes brimmed with tears. "All I know is we had four kids, and now we have two."
For a time, the lawsuit they filed against Boeing had put Ms. Milleron and Mr. Stumo at odds. The firm that was representing them, Clifford Law Offices in Chicago, had sued Boeing on behalf of other victims' families, too, and the cases were eventually consolidated under one federal judge, Jorge L. Alonso.
In early 2021, lawyers at the Clifford firm took the lead in negotiating a deal with Boeing. For the purposes of this specific litigation, the company would acknowledge that it was liable for the deaths of the Flight 302 passengers. Damages would be decided later, through mediators, judges or juries. The catch was that there would be no discovery process.
Ms. Milleron and her uncle thought this was outrageous. She wanted to depose Boeing's executives and have access to the company's internal documents about the Max jets. Under this deal, whatever secrets were lurking inside Boeing might remain hidden.
Mr. Stumo, however, had spent well over a year working with the Clifford lawyers, and he trusted them. He wanted to accept the deal.
The disagreement escalated into an intense, prolonged fight. "There were a lot of rocky times with Mom and Dad," said Adnaan Stumo, the couple's eldest child.
He and Tor tried to mediate between their warring parents; Mr. Nader pushed his niece to stand firm. Finally, Mr. Stumo relented. When the agreement between Boeing and the victims' kin was announced in November 2021, Samya's family was one of just a few holdouts.
The family soon hired a new law firm. The goal was to advance toward trial, collecting evidence and sworn testimony along the way.
But Judge Alonso granted Boeing's requests to put the family's lawsuit on ice so that the company could focus on resolving cases that fell under the agreement it had negotiated with the plaintiffs' lawyers. He hasn't allowed discovery or depositions in Ms. Milleron's suit to get underway.
'Grief Bends Your Body'
In early 2022, Ms. Milleron embarked on a new mission.
Boeing's home state of Illinois, where her lawsuit had been filed, was one of about a dozen with a bizarre wrinkle in its laws. If a company injured someone, the victim could seek both compensatory damages (to make up for things like lost income) and punitive damages (to punish the company and discourage future misconduct). But if the company was responsible for someone's death, only compensatory damages were permitted.
The laws reflected fears that juries would overreact in emotionally charged death cases, potentially bankrupting business. Ms. Milleron and Mr. Nader thought the laws invited corporate recklessness, because the absence of punitive damages removed a deterrent to bad behavior.
Now they hatched a plan: Ms. Milleron would try to change the Illinois law.
"You need to go do this," Mr. Nader told her, even as some family members rolled their eyes.
"I thought it was crazy but figured it would help her work through stuff," Tor said.
In February 2022, Ms. Milleron packed her Toyota Prius with photos of crash victims and drove more than 1,000 miles to Springfield, the state capital.
One of her first meetings was with La Shawn K. Ford, a progressive state representative. When she said that she planned to stay in Springfield for as long as it took, Mr. Ford agreed to help. "That was enough for me," he said, "the fact that she was willing to fight for it."
Mr. Ford asked the legislature's staff to draft a bill permitting punitive damages in wrongful-death suits. It was up to Ms. Milleron to drum up support.
She positioned herself just outside the House of Representatives' chamber, a gathering spot for lobbyists known as the Rail.
Every day that the legislature was in session, Ms. Milleron was at the Rail or wandering the corridors of the Capitol or schmoozing lawmakers' secretaries and trying to get an audience. She cut an unintimidating figure: dressed in black, her graying hair in a bun, her bad back causing her to hunch. "The grief bends your body," she said.
When Ms. Milleron wasn't at the Capitol, she was swimming at the Y.M.C.A. or holed up at a Motel 6. Some nights she called Tor. "She was really struggling and felt alone and isolated," he said. He came to Illinois and found that the Prius was filthy and smelled like something had died inside. He worried that his mother was unraveling.
There were two main obstacles to getting the law passed. One was the business lobby, which leaned on Republican lawmakers to block the bill. The other involved Democrats. Several told Ms. Milleron that they deferred to the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association on matters related to legal policy. And the group was not backing the bill; it was focused on other legislative priorities.
Ms. Milleron wrote to ITLA's president and staff. She got no response. Mr. Nader wrote, too. Nothing.
One day, Ms. Milleron was looking for a place to grab a bite near the Capitol. She came across a squat, Tudor-style building and realized with surprise that it was ITLA's office. She went inside. Nobody was at the reception. Eventually one of the people Ms. Milleron had been emailing emerged. When Ms. Milleron introduced herself, he insisted that he had no time to speak to her and hurried away.
Demoralized, she went into the stairwell and let herself cry. Soon, a different staff member walked in. "I know who you are," Ms. Milleron said the woman told her. "I know why you're here. Just keep going. Don't give up."
But after more than two months in Illinois, Ms. Milleron didn't see the point. The bill hadn't gained traction. There hadn't even been hearings. She drove back to Massachusetts, feeling discouraged.
That summer, though, the trial lawyers' association named a new president, Patrick A. Salvi II. When he heard from Ms. Milleron urging his group to support the bill, he said, "I told her I intend to aggressively pursue this as a top goal."
And he did. Mr. Salvi testified before the legislature. His group's support made the difference, lawmakers said. In the space of a single week in May 2023, the bill moved out of committee and onto the floor, where both chambers approved it.
Ms. Milleron was jubilant. "This is one of the biggest achievements of my life and reaffirms my faith that we can make a difference," she wrote in a WhatsApp message to the other crash families.
That August, Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the legislation.
'A Magic Button'
For years, Mr. Nader had been muttering to family members that "we've got to do something about Richie Neal."
He didn't like most politicians, especially those whose campaigns were bankrolled by big companies. And Mr. Neal, the 18-term Democratic congressman who represented Ms. Milleron's hometown, had received millions of dollars in such contributions over the years.
Plus, personal feelings were at play. Mr. Neal had repeatedly criticized Mr. Nader, saying he cost Al Gore the 2000 election. There had been the congressman's quietness after the crash. More recently, Tor had circulated a petition to get Mr. Neal -- the top Democrat on the House committee responsible for tax policy -- to hold a town-hall meeting in the district to discuss funding for the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Neal declined to come.
(In a statement Mr. Neal said, "I commend the family for their advocacy and share their goal of holding Boeing -- and all corporate negligence -- accountable at every turn," adding, "I've always stood up to the powerful on behalf of regular Americans.")
One day in early 2023, Mr. Nader called Adnaan, Ms. Milleron's 30-year-old son, with an idea. All over the country, charismatic young progressives seemed to be toppling members of the old guard. Adnaan should run against Mr. Neal as an independent, he said. Mr. Nader was taken by the idea of Adnaan, who is a violinist, wowing crowds with an anti-corporate stump speech and a musical performance.
"He thinks the music thing is like a magic button," Adnaan said. "He's also 90 and maybe a little out of touch with what's hip."
But Adnaan was intrigued, and he told his granduncle that he would consider it. First, though, he was going on a five-month Arctic expedition aboard a 72-foot schooner, the Marie Tharp.
Since Samya's death, her family had been trying to spend more time with one another, "to hold ourselves more closely," as Adnaan put it. That fall, Ms. Milleron flew to Greenland to meet up with the Marie Tharp.
The boat sailed toward Canada, and mother and son sat in the pilothouse doing night watches together. They discussed his potential candidacy, listened to political podcasts and debated.
As storms lashed the boat, a thought nagged at Ms. Milleron. Though the family had decided they were going to take on Mr. Neal, her son had "never had a household or a mortgage or a car payment or had a child in the hospital," she said. "I was thinking, 'I am so much more qualified to do this than you are."'
When he returned to the United States, Adnaan decided against running. "I'm far too radical," he said.
Ms. Milleron knew what to do. Early this year, Mr. Nader became one of the first to contribute to the Nadia for Congress campaign committee.
Doing Impossible Things
One morning this month, Ms. Milleron made a cup of tea, sat down at her kitchen table and logged into a Zoom meeting with the F.A.A.
For a while after the crash, the agency's representatives had held monthly calls for the families of the Boeing crash victims. The meetings eventually dwindled to once a quarter. Then they seemed to peter out altogether. This was the first one since January, when a fuselage panel blew off a Boeing 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight.
Katie Thomson, a deputy administrator of the F.A.A., provided updates on the agency's oversight of Boeing and began answering questions. Things immediately grew combative. Ms. Milleron and other family members took turns slamming the F.A.A. for a litany of perceived shortcomings, such as not having enough employees stationed at Boeing manufacturing facilities.
Toward the end, a woman who had lost her daughter on the Ethiopian Airlines flight asked Ms. Thomson whether she would be surprised if another Boeing plane were to crash. Yes, Ms. Thomson replied, because the F.A.A. was on the ball.
"This shows you're totally out to lunch," Ms. Milleron erupted. "It's really, really concerning. You have many warning bells that you're not attending to as an agency. You need to grasp reality."
"Nadia, you might not believe it, but we care very much about aviation safety," Ms. Thomson responded.
"I know you care," Ms. Milleron interjected. "But you are complicit in the deaths of our loved ones."
The meeting ended, and Ms. Milleron drove her Prius an hour or so east to Springfield, the largest city in Massachusetts's sprawling First Congressional District, to do some campaigning. She was not deluding herself about her chances. Mr. Neal's campaign had nearly 100 times the cash on hand that hers did, and the incumbent had barely acknowledged Ms. Milleron's existence.
Yet Ms. Milleron said that her fund-raising had recently picked up and noted that no Republican was in the race. "That means I have a chance," she said. She held out hope that her message -- including resuscitating local manufacturing and training more doctors -- would resonate.
Mr. Stumo, for one, had overcome his earlier doubts about the wisdom of his wife's campaign. "I didn't think the punitive damages thing in Illinois was a good idea, but she made it happen," he said. "She and we have done some impossible things throughout this process, and who am I to say otherwise?"
It was a sunny afternoon, and Ms. Milleron walked through a low-income neighborhood of semidetached homes, knocking on doors and handing out campaign fliers.
She approached a man on a stoop. He was wearing a pink shirt, smoking a cigarette and holding a bottle in a brown paper bag. When Ms. Milleron's campaign manager asked if he was a voter, he replied that politicians belonged in the trash. Then he looked at Ms. Milleron.
"I know who you are," he said, his eyes widening. He had seen her TV ads. "I've heard the story about your daughter. It's really bad." He said he would vote for her in November.
Ms. Milleron thanked him and moved on to the next house.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: BYD, which leads China's electric vehicle sector, is constructing a plant in Hungary while its Chinese rivals expand through joint ventures in Europe.
The leafy city of Szeged, Hungary, boasting wide avenues, a respected university and ornate, pale yellow villas near the country's border with Serbia, looks more like a relic of the Hapsburg empire than the location of Europe's automotive future.
But at a 740-acre construction site here, excavators have already begun preparing for what will be the first European assembly plant of China's leading automaker, BYD. Large concrete pipes and stacks of metal sheets stand ready, with the cornerstone to be set this fall.
Timing is crucial. The European Union is poised to decide by Oct. 30 whether to increase tariffs on electric vehicles entering the bloc from China. The duties, on top of an existing 10 percent tariff, would range from 9 to 35.3 percent and remain in effect for five years. They are significantly lower than the 100 percent tariffs imposed by the United States and Canada, but they come as Chinese automakers are eager to break into the European market.
BYD has already been seeking to raise its profile in Europe, working with distributors across 19 countries to offer electric and hybrid models and sponsoring the European Championship soccer tournament this summer.
"They have very ambitious plans," Sandor Nagy, a deputy mayor responsible for urban development in Szeged, said of BYD's plant, which the company plans to bring online next year. "And they obviously have a very strong incentive with the tariffs."
Other Chinese automakers, eager to convince Europeans that their cars are fun to drive and more affordable than models made by European companies, are also looking for ways to avoid the tariffs.
Chery, a Chinese car manufacturer, announced in April that it would begin producing electric vehicles in Barcelona, Spain, in partnership with Ebro EV Motors. Stellantis, whose European brands include Peugeot, Fiat and Opel, announced in May that it was entering into a partnership with Leapmotor of China, with production of electric vehicles in Europe to begin this fall.
Zhejiang Geely Holding, which acquired the Swedish automaker Volvo Cars in 2010, is also scouting for a possible production site in Europe. It owns Polestar, which is based in Sweden but produces its vehicles in China. This year, the company began making a sport utility vehicle at a plant in South Carolina, which will also be used to supply the European market.
The moves into Europe come as deliberations about the tariffs head into their final weeks. Wang Wentao, China's minister of commerce, is touring European capitals ahead of a meeting on Thursday in Brussels with Valdis Dombrovskis, the E.U. commissioner for trade.
E.U. officials worry that China poses a threat to Europe's auto industry, which accounts for nearly 7 percent of the region's economic output. They say Beijing has not offered a solution that sufficiently addresses their concerns that years of government support have granted Chinese automakers an unfair advantage over their European peers.
Analysts believe that shifting production closer to the market will benefit both sides: The European auto industry would gain jobs and access to cutting-edge technology, while Chinese producers would save on tariffs and shipping costs.
"I don't think it makes corporate sense from simply a profitability point of view to think you can supply the global car market from factories in China," said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
Chinese brands accounted for 3.7 percent of all electric vehicles sold in Europe in 2023, compared with 0.4 percent of market share four years earlier. That number is expected to climb in the next five years.
In July, Turkey announced that BYD would build an assembly plant there, with production of battery-powered and hybrid cars to begin in 2026. Turkey is not an E.U. member, but trade agreements mean that cars made there would not be subject to the tariffs.
In Szeged, BYD is aiming to ramp up production over the next few years, creating thousands of new jobs. The speed is part of a push to get its cars onto the European market, despite the recent slump in demand.
Already the company has been working to make itself known across Europe, setting up relationships with dealers. At the European soccer championship in Germany, BYD displayed its cars at fan fairs in 10 cities, and its logo flashed on the sideboards throughout the matches.
Germany is Europe's largest economy and its largest market for cars. But it also holds a special prestige for China. Germany's top automakers -- Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz -- helped to develop the auto industry there through joint ventures formed with Chinese companies in the early 1990s.
But German consumers are traditionally conservative and deeply loyal to their brands. Berlin's decision to abruptly cut subsidies toward the purchase of electric vehicles led to a nearly 37 percent drop in new registrations in the year through July, compared with the same time in the previous year.
That has not stopped Chinese automakers from trying to gain a toehold. Last week, several Chinese car manufacturers displayed their latest models at a trade fair in Frankfurt that is normally focused on automotive suppliers.
"Even if some in Europe turn against us, we will never turn against the European market," Victor Yang, senior vice president at Geely, told reporters at the fair.
The interest in Europe is not just from automakers. More Chinese suppliers have arrived over the past several years to be closer to the assembly plants that purchase their products, said Maarten Otte, the head of investor relations for Central and Eastern Europe at CTP, a logistics and industrial real estate firm.
Automakers such as BMW that rely on parts made by Chinese companies are concerned about the costs and the risks associated with shipping goods overseas and are looking to make their supply chains more affordable and secure, he said.
"So they say, 'If you want to produce for our European market, you need to be in Europe,"' Mr. Otte said. A combination of skilled workers available at lower wages and the availability of undeveloped land has made countries in Central and Eastern Europe especially interesting, he said.
The Hungarian government of Viktor Orban has pledged incentives to support the project but has not yet disclosed the amount. BYD did not respond to a request for comment.
Some analysts have drawn parallels between the situation playing out in Europe and Washington's approach to Toyota and Honda, Japanese brands that invested heavily in production in the United States in the 1980s.
But despite attempts to shift the relationship from cooperation to competition, China remains Europe's second-largest trading partner, after the United States, with bilateral trade worth 739 billion euros, or $ 814 billion, in 2023.
"All of these things combined produce an overall political situation where the national security-driven U.S. approach is certainly not desirable in Europe," said Mr. Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute.
This is especially true in Germany, where automakers are heavily invested in China and, fearful of endangering their interests there, oppose the tariffs.
And during a visit to China last week, Pedro Sánchez, the prime minister of Spain -- Europe's second-largest car manufacturer -- urged Brussels to reconsider its position, arguing that pursuing the tariffs would be harmful.
"We don't need another war, in this case a trade war," Mr. Sánchez said. "I think we need to build bridges between the European Union and China."

Should I Get a Hybrid or Go Full Electric?: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For many car buyers, hybrids seem like a great compromise between gasoline and electric vehicles. Hybrids, which combine internal combustion engines and electric motors, produce less pollution and use less fuel than conventional automobiles. And, owners never need to worry about running out of battery power on a lonely highway.
But while hybrids do save money for some people, that's not always the case. And many experts and environmental groups are critical of hybrids, saying that the fuel savings are exaggerated and that they don't cut greenhouse gas emissions as much as needed to slow global warming.
Still, many car shoppers are clearly convinced of the benefits. Sales of hybrid cars in the United States were up 33 percent from January through July compared to the previous year, accounting for 11 percent of new car sales, according to government data.
Here's what to know if you're in the market.
Not all hybrids are created equal
There are basically two kinds of hybrids: conventional and plug-in. Conventional hybrids, also known as mild hybrids, have equipment that recaptures some of the energy from braking and uses it to charge a battery. Then, the battery powers an electric motor that augments the gasoline engine.
This setup helps compensate for the inherent inefficiency of gasoline engines. A gasoline car typically converts less than a third of the energy in a gallon of fuel into forward motion. Some of the energy is wasted by the brakes, which convert motion to heat.
By recycling some of that lost energy to charge a battery, the $ 28,000 base model of the Toyota Prius, to cite one example, gets 57 miles to the gallon, according to Environmental Protection Agency estimates.
But conventional hybrids still burn gasoline. That means they contribute to climate change and generate harmful air pollution. They are, in effect, just more efficient gasoline vehicles.
'Go a month' without buying gas
Plug-in hybrids have larger batteries capable of powering cars solely with electricity for shorter distances. They can connect to the same chargers as electric vehicles as well as ordinary electrical outlets.
The plug-in version of the Toyota RAV4 sport utility vehicle can travel about 40 miles on battery power alone, more than most Americans typically drive in a day. A gasoline motor takes over when the battery runs out of juice. In theory, plug-in owners don't need to buy gas unless they're taking a longer road trip.
"You could go a month without putting any gas in your vehicle," said Jack Hollis, the chief operating officer of Toyota Motor North America. "On your weekends," he added, "when you're wanting to get away and you want to go two, three, four hundred miles, having that plug-in hybrid really is a solution."
And, Mr. Hollis also noted that hybrids tend to be more affordable than fully electric vehicles. They often cost only a few hundred dollars more than their gas-powered counterparts. Electric vehicles usually cost thousands of dollars more.
A few plug-in hybrids, including some versions of the Jeep Wrangler and Ford Escape, qualify for federal tax credits of up to $ 3,750, which adds to the potential savings on fuel costs. (No Toyotas qualify because they have too many imported components.)
Better than full electric?
While hybrids do less damage to the environment than gasoline cars, fully electric vehicles are a far more effective weapon against climate change, said Peter Slowik, who focuses on passenger cars at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit research and advocacy group.
"There is no realistic pathway to meet our climate goals with any vehicles that combust fossil fuels," Mr. Slowik said.
A plug-in hybrid produces twice the greenhouse gas emissions of a fully electric vehicle over its lifetime, according to research by the council that takes into account emissions from manufacturing and from recycling batteries when a car reaches the end of its life.
Another potential drawback of plug-in hybrids is their complexity, which can add to maintenance costs. Plug-in hybrids have more moving parts that can break. Unlike electric cars, both kinds of hybrids require oil changes. Generally speaking, both hybrids and electric cars cost more to insure than gasoline vehicles.
That said, hybrids are generally reliable because they tend to come from carmakers like Toyota or Honda with track records of making durable products, said Keith Barry, a senior writer at Consumer Reports who covers cars. "The manufacturers that make hybrids tend to be the most reliable overall," he said.
It's important to note that plug-in hybrids offer little benefit if owners don't keep them charged. And, according to a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation, many don't.
In fact, owners of plug-in hybrids with 40 miles of range typically drove only 45 percent of the time on battery power, much less than the Environmental Protection Agency assumes when calculating fuel economy. The study, which analyzed millions of miles of data collected from vehicles, found that actual fuel consumption was as much as two-thirds higher than E.P.A. estimates.
The bottom line
Mr. Barry argued that plug-in hybrids make environmental and financial sense for people who can charge at home or work. The choice comes down to how much you drive, how much you pay for electricity, and what price range you are considering.
If you're in the market for a smaller car, "a hybrid is going to be a better bet," he said. That's because there aren't yet that many inexpensive small electric cars to choose from. But, Mr. Barry said, "if you're looking at a luxury car or a sportier car, usually the electric will save you some money."
The argument for hybrids is likely to grow weaker in years to come. Prices of fully electric vehicles are falling fast, and there are more and more models to choose from. Public chargers are proliferating, new technology is reducing the time it takes to charge, and cars that can travel 300 miles or more between charges are becoming commonplace.
The fully electric version of General Motors' Chevrolet Equinox, which is just starting to appear at dealerships, starts at $ 27,500 after a federal tax credit. The Equinox, which can travel more than 300 miles on a charge, is the first of a wave of lower-priced electric vehicles that will appear in the next few years and may undercut hybrids and gasoline vehicles on price, even without taking into account savings on fuel. A Toyota RAV4 plug-in starts at $ 43,700.
"For some folks, plug-in hybrids are a good interim case particularly if they are traveling long distances and don't have access to charging," said Katherine Garcia, the director of the Clean Transportation for All Campaign at the Sierra Club. "But we really want to be educating folks that the reality is, because of the climate crisis, we need to be moving away from fossil fuels."

Weighing the Pros and Cons of Buying vs. Leasing a Car: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The lowest overall cost is to buy a car and keep it for a long time. But leasing usually has lower monthly costs. And leasing an E.V. may come with a tax break.
Most people have two options when they want a new car: buy it with a traditional loan or lease it.
Either can make sense, depending on your personal situation.
If you're looking for the lowest overall cost over the longer term, buying a car with a loan, and then driving it for a while debt free after you finish making payments, is usually the best option.
But if low monthly payments and a smaller down payment are a priority, a lease may be worth considering. And if you're willing to try an electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid, tax breaks available for leased models may make deals more affordable. Almost half of new E.V.s were acquired with leases in the second quarter of this year, up from around a fourth a year earlier, according to data from Experian.
The Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to cut its benchmark rate by half a point indirectly affects rates on car loans, which are also influenced by factors like the borrower's credit score and the level of loan delinquencies. The average interest rate for a new-car loan in August was 7.1 percent, and 11.3 percent for a used-car loan, according to the automotive site Edmunds. "It will take a number of additional rate cuts before the cumulative effect becomes material for car buyers," said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.
Paying cash for your car is, of course, interest free. But while car prices have eased somewhat, they remain high. The average transaction price in July was around $ 48,000 for a new car, and about $ 25,000 for a used car, according to Kelly Blue Book, part of Cox Automotive. Most people who buy a new automobile and many who buy one used get some kind of financing.
With a traditional loan, you make a down payment and then pay off the debt with fixed monthly payments over time. (The average new-car loan term is about six years.) When the loan is repaid, you can keep the car and drive it payment free or trade it in and get credit for its value toward your next car purchase.
With a lease, you're essentially paying for the car's depreciation -- the difference between the car's value at the beginning and end of the lease. Down payments and monthly payments on a lease are usually lower, but when the lease ends after two or three years, you haven't built up any equity to help you acquire your next car.
Ivan Drury, senior manager of insights at Edmunds.com, ran an analysis for the Times that illustrates the difference between traditional financing and leasing for a popular car model.
Consider a 2025 Toyota Camry SE sedan, purchased for about $ 40,910 (including taxes, fees and any add-ons, like extended warranties), with a down payment of $ 3,365 and a loan through the dealership of $ 37,545, paid over 72 months at 7.4 percent interest. The final cost to the buyer after paying off the loan, Mr. Drury's calculation shows, would be about $ 50,161. The car's estimated value after six years would be $ 14,623.
Lease terms are typically shorter than traditional loans. So to arrive at a rough comparison over six years, Mr. Drury ran the lease calculation as if the shopper had taken out two consecutive 36-month leases on the same terms, with a down payment of $ 1,729 and $ 33,390 (roughly the amount the car is expected to depreciate in value plus taxes, fees and any add-ons) financed at 7.4 percent. The final cost in this scenario, which leaves the driver with no equity in the car after six years, would be $ 5,908 higher than traditional loan financing when factoring in equity earned with the loan option.
But monthly payments for the lease would be $ 528, compared with $ 650 for the loan. Ben Preston, an automotive writer with Consumer Reports, said that can make a difference to shoppers on a strict budget -- say, a young couple needing a bigger car to accommodate a growing family. But if you're choosing a lease just to get a fancy car that you couldn't otherwise afford, he said, you may want to reconsider. "Think about what you need versus what you want," he said.
Buying a used Camry is the overall cheapest option, Mr. Drury's analysis shows. The interest rate on a loan for a 2021 Camry is higher but the amount financed is lower and you build equity in the car, so the total cost is under $ 32,000. The downside? You'll have potentially higher maintenance and repair costs as the car ages, and you won't have the most up-to-date safety features. And that's something to think about, particularly if a teenager new to driving will be behind the wheel.
Also, leases have requirements that can add to your costs if you're not careful, said Charlie Chesbrough, a senior economist at Cox Automotive. A lease may not be ideal if you drive long distances, for instance, because they have mileage caps -- say, 15,000 miles per year. If you exceed the limit, you may owe fees of 15 to 30 cents for each extra mile. You could also be charged fees for excess "wear and tear," he said, so you must be careful about how you use the vehicle, particularly if it's a pickup truck. A couple of minor dings probably won't cost you. "But if it looks like you've been throwing cinder blocks into the back, that's a different story," Mr. Chesbrough said.
If you're considering leasing an electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid, you could make lower payments because of a quirk in the "clean vehicle" tax breaks created by the Inflation Reduction Act. The law created a tax credit of up to $ 7,500 for the purchase of a new electric vehicle, but it can be hard to qualify because of income limits and other complex criteria, like where the car was manufactured and the source of components used in the car's battery. Leases, however, are considered "commercial" transactions, so most of those restrictions don't apply, Mr. Chesbrough said. Carmakers receive the $ 7,500 credit and can pass the savings along to buyers by lowering their monthly lease payments.
There were concerns about whether car dealers would share the full value of the credit with customers in their leases, Mr. Drury said. But with some consumers slow to warm to E.V.s because of the cost and the spotty availability of public charging options, dealers are eager to move electric cars off sales lots, he said. "It's almost guaranteed that you'll get the full $ 7,500."
Check manufacturer and dealer websites for lease offerings that include the credit. A Hyundai dealership in Massachusetts this month was offering a two-year lease deal of $ 413 a month for an electric Kona SE, a small S.U.V., including a $ 7,500 E.V. "lease bonus."
The offer ends on Sept. 30.
Here are some questions and answers about buying or leasing a car:
Can I lease a used car?
Leases are typically reserved for new cars, but some car makers with "certified" used car programs may offer leases.
Do states offer incentives for electric vehicles?
Many states have tax credits or other incentives, like rebates to help pay for installing home chargers, that can help with the cost of an E.V. You can search by state on the federal Energy Department's website.
What's the annual cost of owning a car?
You're not done spending after you drive your car home. The total cost to own and operate a new car is about $ 12,300 a year, or $ 1,025 a month, including finance costs, depreciation, fuel, maintenance and repair, insurance, tires and other costs, according to the latest analysis from AAA, the automobile owners group.
E.V.s can cost up to $ 44 more per month on average to insure than gas-powered cars because "their parts are scarcer and more expensive in general," the National Association of Insurance Commissioners said earlier this year. As E.V.s become more common and their parts more easily accessible, their insurance rates may drop, the association said.

G.M. and Hyundai Plan to Work Together on New Vehicles and Supply Chains: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: General Motors and the South Korean automaker say they will collaborate on new vehicles, buying parts and clean energy technologies.
General Motors and Hyundai said on Thursday that they would look for areas where they could collaborate on new vehicles, supply chains and technologies in a bid to cut costs and move faster.
The two automakers said they aimed to work together on internal combustion, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. But they did not provide details on where the joint work would be done, which executives would oversee the effort or how quickly they would come up with new models.
"G.M. and Hyundai have complementary strengths and talented teams," Mary T. Barra, G.M.'s chief executive, said in a statement. "Our goal is to unlock the scale and creativity of both companies to deliver even more competitive vehicles to customers faster and more efficiently."
The companies have signed a nonbinding agreement and said they would begin exploring possible areas of cooperation immediately.
Like other automakers, G.M. and Hyundai have invested tens of billions of dollars to develop electric vehicles that have so far fallen short of the lofty sales goals some executives had set. Consumer enthusiasm for battery-powered models has cooled in the past year, largely on concerns about the high prices of electric models and the challenges of charging them.
Sales of such cars and trucks are growing at a modest pace, though generally at a faster pace than for conventional gasoline vehicles. Many manufacturers, including Tesla, have cut prices to spur demand and are scrambling to reduce costs.
"This partnership will enable Hyundai Motor and G.M. to evaluate opportunities to enhance competitiveness in key markets and vehicle segments, as well as drive cost efficiencies and provide stronger customer value," Hyundai's group executive chair, Chung Eui-sun, said in a statement.
G.M. has been losing money on the electric models it makes but has said it expects those vehicles to become profitable by the end of the year. Ford Motor lost $ 2.5 billion on its electric vehicle business in the first half of this year, and has set up a development team in California to design models that are less costly to produce.
Automotive partnerships have had a mixed record of success, however. Several years ago, Ford invested in the electric vehicle start-up Rivian, but later decided to sell most of its shares. Ford also established a partnership with Volkswagen, but the companies have reduced their collaboration, and Volkswagen said this year that it would work with Rivian, mainly on software.
G.M. and Honda also formed a partnership to develop electric vehicles. Honda and its luxury brand, Acura, recently introduced two electric sport utility vehicles that are assembled at G.M. factories with G.M.'s battery technology. But the two companies have scrapped plans to work together on more models, and Honda has said it is solely developing its next slate of battery-powered models. Tesla has at different times worked with Toyota and Mercedes-Benz before shifting its strategy.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A new book explores the obsession and explains why it's not exactly like collecting dolls: "It puts people in touch with their own mortality."
As collectibles go, trees break the mold -- and not just because they don't fit on a shelf or require periodic dusting.
It didn't even compute, really, the first time Amy Stewart heard someone say they collected trees about a decade ago. But when she heard the same claim in subsequent years, from people who weren't affiliated with arboretums or nurseries, she knew she needed to investigate.
What resulted is her latest book, "The Tree Collectors: Tales of Arboreal Obsession," and a newfound understanding that trees are distinguished from other collectibles by their power to transform those who collect them.
When you collect trees -- rather than dolls or ceramics or some other form of memorabilia -- the element of time enters the equation.
"Everyone who puts a tree in the ground understands that that tree is probably going to outlive them," she said. "It puts people in touch with their own mortality, but also with this sense that life continues on, and that you can do something positive for the future. Trees come with hope preinstalled."
That hope manifested in diverse ways among the 50 collectors profiled in "The Tree Collectors," which is not Ms. Stewart's first alternative take on a botanical topic. "The Drunken Botanist: The Plants That Create the World's Great Drinks" became a New York Times best seller in 2013, as did "Wicked Plants: The Weed That Killed Lincoln's Mother and Other Botanical Atrocities" in 2009.
When Trees Become Family
Before she started on the new book, Ms. Stewart said, she recalls thinking, "'Oh, the trees, aren't they great?'-- the trees, plural."
She added: "But this made me start noticing individual trees. That's what collectors do, right? They're like, 'Which one do you really want?' One is not the same as another, and so that's a collector's mind-set."
And it takes only one: That's how any collection begins, with the first acquisition.
Marie Noelle Bouvet, a veterinarian in Ipswich, England, acquired her first tree quite by accident. A potted seedling Japanese maple (Acer palmatum), it was left behind by the previous tenant of an apartment she and her husband rented. The baby tree moved with them after that, until they finally landed at a place with a small piece of land where they could plant it. There, it gradually became part of a group of 50 maples she acquired, one by one. Today, they have a larger property, and her collection of trees numbers 4,000.
But for Ms. Bouvet, it's not about the tally, as if she who has the most maples wins. She has found that the real reward is in the privilege of nurturing the trees, starting with that first abandoned one, a process she credits with helping her work through the sense of loss she had because she and her husband were unable to have children.
"The trees have become kind of a family to me," she told Ms. Stewart, noting that they "filled a void."
She hopes to someday name an Acer palmatum variety from a seedling offspring from her collection, one that displays distinctive characteristics warranting it. "I keep sowing the seeds and looking for one that will be spectacular," she told Ms. Stewart. "I think about what I would name it. I've not been able to give a name to a baby. I would like to name a tree."
Connecting with Cultural Heritage
Other collectors have found that their trees take them on a journey through their lineage and cultural history.
In her quarter-acre yard in San Jose, Calif., Vivian Keh grows 50 fruit trees, but persimmons are the focus, "a sort of spiritual force in her home orchard," as Ms. Stewart put it.
When Ms. Keh was a drama student at Yale, she wrote "Persimmons in Winter," a play based on her Korean ancestors' experiences during and after the Korean War, and "the connection between persimmons and getting through hard times," Ms. Stewart said.
The fruits are a Buddhist symbol of transformation, used in ceremonies and to honor the dead. And the traditional Asian type (Diospyros kaki) that would have been familiar to Ms. Keh's ancestors ripened in winter, providing welcome off-season sweetness. She may not know every detail of those difficult war years, but she knows that persimmons were, and are, a bright spot. So each winter, she boxes up the fruit from her harvest to send to her mother and other relatives.
"Being a child of immigrants, relationships can get complicated," she told Ms. Stewart. "One way I can offer a gesture of love is by giving my elders these fruits that they adore. It keeps me connected to them."
In Search of Navajo Peaches
Reagan Wytsalucy, an extension assistant professor for Utah State University, is of Navajo descent, something she began to explore more deeply while working on her master's thesis.
Her father suggested the subject, she told Ms. Stewart: to look into the story of the Navajo peach trees, a form of Prunus persica that produces white-fleshed fruit that is smaller than today's commercial varieties. These peaches were a traditional crop of Indigenous people in the Southwest, including parts of what is now Arizona, as well as New Mexico, where she grew up.
In the 1860s, thousands of Navajo people were forced off their homelands by the U.S. Army, marched in the notorious Long Walk to internment camps hundreds of miles away, in eastern New Mexico. Villages were intentionally erased, along with the many peach orchards in the Canyon de Chelly region of eastern Arizona, "to destroy their way of life and to make sure they had nothing to come back to," Ms. Stewart said.
Ms. Wytsalucy continues to seek out the traditional peaches, and their stories. Along the way she has learned of an ancestor who stayed behind, hiding out to help maintain the few remaining peach trees and livestock, "so that people would have something to come back to -- and they did eventually come back," Ms. Stewart said.
This particular tree collection has taken the form of a test orchard in Utah, planted from seeds of the heirloom trees, allowing Ms. Wytsalucy to study their traits and performance while imagining a culturally appropriate way they might possibly be reintroduced one day.
A Tree Farm to Support His Heirs
In Green Pond, S.C., Joe Hamilton's tree collection stands on what was once heirs' property: family land that wasn't passed down with legally binding documentation, like a will.
In a case like this, the heirs may be living on the land and paying the taxes, but the title is not clearly any one person's, "so they're in this difficult position of not technically owning it," Ms. Stewart said. Heirs' property is familiar to many descendants of formerly enslaved people who came into some land at the end of the Civil War, including Mr. Hamilton's great-grandfather, she added.
Mr. Hamilton was determined to resolve the matter, and did after years of work. Today, on 44 secure acres, he grows loblolly pines (Pinus taeda), a Southeast native used for telephone poles and lumber. His trees are intended to be a more sustainable wood source than timber harvested from forested areas.
"He's the only 'tree collector' in the book who's cutting his trees down," Ms. Stewart said. "But it's a long-term timber-harvest plan taking place over generations. And he's thinking about it in terms of creating generational wealth" -- for his children and beyond.
Pocket Forests, and a Collection Grafted Onto a Single Tree
While many tree collectors have plenty of land, acreage is not necessarily a requirement.
Shubhendu Sharma's backyard in Uttarakhand, India, is a tiny forest that he planted from seedlings, after deeply cultivating the soil and inoculating it with microbes. Mr. Sharma, a former Toyota engineer, learned the technique from the Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki, who created a Miyawaki forest, as these pocket forests are known, at Toyota's campus in Bengaluru, or Bangalore. Mr. Sharma was inspired to make it his life's work, and he founded a company that plants native forests on various scales.
A tree collection could even emanate from a single trunk. Sam Van Aken, an artist in Syracuse, N.Y., creates living conceptual pieces like "The Tree of 40 Fruit," which has 40 stone fruit varieties grafted onto one plum, yielding a many-colored spectacle at bloom time.
As for Ms. Stewart, she does not collect trees. But if she did?
"Super-weird conifers" might be her focus, she imagines. She and her husband (a rare book dealer, which makes him a collector in his own right) live in an apartment in Portland, Ore., in "a neighborhood that has an incredible tree canopy," she said. She is a self-described "big walker," who is "in the forest pretty much every day," enjoying nearby Forest Park and Washington Park.
Besides trees' potential life span, what strikes her most is their scale, as the largest creatures we live alongside.
"You're lucky if you even get to see a whale, but I can walk up to a 200-year-old Douglas fir and hug it any day of the week," she said. "And I often do."

Immigration Debate Descends on an Ohio Town: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Jobs attracted thousands of Haitians to Springfield, and employers were ecstatic. But then an immigrant driver was involved in a fatal school bus crash. And JD Vance entered the fray.
It has been more than a year since the fateful morning last August when, outside Springfield in southwestern Ohio, a minivan veered into oncoming traffic and rammed into a school bus on the first day of class, killing an 11-year-old boy and injuring 23 other children.
Soon, it emerged that the driver of the minivan was not a longtime resident but one of the thousands of immigrants from Haiti who had recently settled in the area. He was driving with a foreign license not valid in Ohio.
The stage was set for another fraught chapter in the debate over immigration in America, this one magnified because JD Vance, the state's junior senator, would soon become the Republican vice-presidential nominee.
Haitians were new to the region. During the last census, in 2020, a little more than 58,000 people lived in Springfield, a town at the crossroads of America that had fallen on hard times and shed population as opportunity slipped away. But it has changed dramatically in recent years, as a boom in manufacturing and warehouse jobs attracted a swelling wave of immigrants, mainly from Haiti. City officials estimate that as many as 20,000 Haitians have arrived, most of them since the pandemic.
At the first City Commission meeting after the bus crash, angry residents packed the chambers and demanded answers.
"How do you know we aren't getting criminals, rapists?" a man in a blue Harley Davidson T-shirt asked. "Who can stop them from coming here?" someone else wanted to know. Had they been screened? Were they going to use their driver's licenses to vote?
The city manager, Bryan Heck, explained that the Haitians were lawfully in the country. The police chief, Allison Elliott, said that Haitians were not responsible for the city's yearslong struggle with crime such as retail theft. Commissioners said that they had come for job opportunities.
But nothing could quell the outrage.
The arrival of successive streams of immigrants has created friction throughout America's history. In recent years, especially, people from all over the world have settled in places, like Springfield, unaccustomed to high levels of immigration.
The issue has become even more politicized this year, as the presidential election campaign focuses on the record number of crossings on the southern border in 2023. So it came as no surprise that the influx of Haitians to Springfield would become a talking point for Mr. Vance.
In a speech at the National Conservatism Conference in July, he described Springfield as a town that was nearly a carbon copy of Middletown, where he grew up, except that it had now been "overwhelmed" by Haitians who were pushing up housing costs and collecting benefits.
"And you don't have to believe, of course, that the 20,000, at least most of the 20,000 newcomers, are bad people" to recognize it as a problem, he said.
By most accounts, the Haitians have helped revitalize Springfield.
They are assembling car engines at Honda, running vegetable-packing machines at Dole and loading boxes at distribution centers. They are paying taxes on their wages and spending money at Walmart. On Sundays they gather at churches for boisterous, joyful services in Haitian Creole.
But the speed and volume of arrivals have put pressure on housing, schools and hospitals. The community health clinic saw a 13-fold increase in Haitian patients between 2021 and 2023, from 115 to 1,500, overwhelming its staff and budget.
The bus crash, which killed Aiden Clark, the son of two teachers, touched off resentment that had been building for months or longer, many residents said.
"Aiden's death was the match on the tinder bundle," said Chris Cook, the Clark County health commissioner.
A City's Revitalization
For decades, Springfield had been another shrinking Midwestern town with an uncertain future.
Manufacturing plants had shuttered, fueling an exodus. Empty Victorian mansions on Fountain Avenue, erected for industrial barons, stood as relics of the town's heyday.
The population dwindled to less than 60,000 by 2014, from more than 80,000 in 1960.
Around that time, Springfield crafted a strategic plan to attract business. City leaders pitched the town's affordability, its work force development programs and its location, smack-dab between Columbus and Dayton and accessible to two interstates.
In 2017, Topre, a major Japanese auto parts manufacturer, picked Springfield for a new plant in a decaying part of town that had been the site of International Harvester, a farm equipment manufacturer that was once the biggest employer.
By 2020, Springfield had lured food-service firms, logistics companies and a microchip maker, among others, creating an estimated 8,000 new jobs and optimism for the future.
"It was incredible to witness the transformation of our community," said Horton Hobbs, vice president of economic development for the Greater Springfield Partnership, which executed the plan.
But soon there were not enough workers. Many young, working-age people had descended into addiction. Others shunned entry-level, rote work altogether, employers said.
Haitians who heard that the Springfield area boasted well-paying, blue-collar jobs and a low cost of living poured in, and employers were eager to hire and train the new work force.
The Haitians had Social Security numbers and work permits, thanks to a federal program that offered them temporary protection in the United States. Some had been living for years in places like Florida, where there is a thriving Haitian community.
McGregor Metal, a family-owned business in Springfield that makes parts for cars, trucks and tractors, was short of workers after investing millions to boost production.
The business needed machine operators, forklift drivers and quality inspectors, said Jamie McGregor, the chief executive.
"The Haitians were there to fill those positions," he said. The immigrants now comprise about 10 percent of his work force.
"They come to work every day. They don't cause drama. They're on time," he said.
Among the Haitians recently on the second shift, which stretched to 1 a.m., was Daniel Campere, operating a robotic welder that makes axle components for Toyota trucks.
Mr. Campere, who arrived in the United States in 2013, for years earned his keep shuttling workers between the tomato fields in Florida and Georgia. Then some friends who had moved to Springfield urged him to give it a try.
He started at McGregor in June 2021 and now makes $ 19 an hour, with a 401(k) and health insurance.
He has been able to buy a house in Miami, which he rents out. In Springfield, he shares a house with three other Haitian men, who together pay $ 2,400 in rent.
Mr. Campere said that he was aware of the criticism leveled at his community. "We can't say anything. The Americans are chez eux," he said, using the French words for "in their home."
After a pause, he added, "We pay bills and taxes like everybody else."
Vickie Stevens, an American worker, overheard the conversation in the break room, and shared her two cents.
"I can tell you, Daniel's a real good worker," she said. "He works as many hours as he can get." She added: "We, the Americans, are just a little jealous of them."
The Impact on Clinics and Schools
At the Rocking Horse Community Health Center, a federally subsidized clinic that does not turn away anyone, a surge in Haitians has caused a consultation that normally took 15 minutes to take as long as 45 minutes because of the language barrier.
"We lost productivity. We had a huge burnout of staff," said Yamini Teegala, the chief executive officer.
Six Haitian Creole speakers were hired and trained to assist newcomers. But expenditures on translation services jumped to an estimated $ 436,000 this year from $ 43,000 in 2020, she said.
"This is not sustainable," Dr. Teegala said, adding that her priority was not to save money but to ensure quality care.
On Aug. 14, the first day of school, the Springfield City School District's registration department was crammed with immigrant families waiting to enroll children, so many that some had to queue up in the hallway.
Nearly 350 new students registered for elementary and middle school the first week of classes, most of them children of immigrants.
The school district has hired about two dozen teachers who are certified to teach English as a second language and several Haitian-Creole interpreters, thanks to federal and state pandemic-related funds. The immigrant students have boosted enrollment after years of decline, and enriched the learning environment, said Pam Shay, director of federal programs.
But she expressed concern about the 2025-26 academic year. "It's going to get very tight," she said.
Springfield, like many towns, is also struggling with a dearth of affordable housing for low-income families, and the Haitian influx has not helped.
On July 8, Mr. Heck, the city manager, cited the arrivals in a letter to the leaders of the Senate Banking Committee requesting federal help. He copied Senator Vance.
The next day, at a committee meeting, Mr. Vance questioned Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chairman, about the relationship between "high illegal immigration levels under the Biden administration" and rising housing costs.
Mr. Vance referenced Springfield, saying it "highlights a very real example of this particular concern."
Michelle Lee-Hall, executive director of Springfield's housing authority, said that the affordability problem had been aggravated by landlords pivoting to Haitians who were willing to pay higher rent.
Landlords have withdrawn about 200 properties from a federal housing-voucher program for low-income families, she said.
"Here in Springfield, the new homeless are people who can't afford to pay $ 2,000 or $ 3,000 a month in rent," she said.
Gary Durst, who buys and refurbishes distressed homes, has 400 units in his portfolio, and about 80 percent of the tenants are Haitian.
He acknowledged that some Americans have been displaced. But on many streets, newly renovated homes are giving blighted neighborhoods a face lift, he said. No longer delinquent on property tax, they pump revenue into Springfield's coffers.
"I probably have $ 25 million invested in this town," Mr. Durst said. "I believe in this town."
A Fatal Crash
The accident that inflamed tensions happened last Aug. 22, when the school bus, carrying 52 students, lumbered down Route 41 outside of town. A 2010 Honda Odyssey moving in the opposite direction jumped across the center divider and into the bus's path.
The bus driver tried to maneuver away but could not avert a collision. The bus plunged off the side of the road, and Aiden was thrown out of an emergency hatch as the bus flipped over and then landed on him. The boy was pronounced dead at the scene. More than 20 other children were taken to the hospital.
A lawyer for the minivan driver, Hermanio Joseph, 36, said at his trial in April that the sun had blinded him. Mr. Joseph, who has a spouse and four children in Haiti, had been living in Springfield for more than a year, working at a warehouse.
Police officers found no evidence of drug or alcohol consumption. But Mr. Joseph was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and he could spend nine years behind bars.
The tragedy shook Springfield residents, and it emboldened many who crowded the first City Commission meeting after the accident to air long-held suspicions and grievances about the newcomers in their midst.
In the year since the crash, hostility toward the Haitians has only intensified, with speakers at more recent commission meetings talking about an "invasion," a description that has become a staple of right-wing immigration rhetoric.
At a meeting on July 30, residents stepped up to two podiums in a session that quickly devolved into chaos.
"Haitians are occupying our land," declared one middle-aged woman, Glenda Bailey, warning that the immigrants would soon become the majority and run everyone else out of town. She said they had low IQs.
Speakers claimed, without evidence, that Haitians were responsible for drug trafficking, retail theft and disease.
"Not one person asked anyone in this community how we felt about them coming in here and invading our city," said one resident, Mike Powell.
Korge Mori, the child of Japanese immigrants, was among a handful of residents who lauded the Haitians. He scolded the mayor and the city manager for "whipping up mass hysteria" during a recent appearance on "Fox & Friends" in which they had blamed President Biden's policies for the Haitians taxing their city.
"There was a time, not too long ago, when we were a dying city, hemorrhaging people and jobs to other places. And the good Lord heard our prayers, and brought us the gift of the Haitian immigrant community," he said.
The drama has not been confined to the City Commission chambers.
On a recent Saturday, about a dozen Nazi sympathizers -- masked men in matching red shirts, black pants and boots -- waved swastika flags as they marched in downtown Springfield near a jazz festival. At least two of the men, who authorities said were outsiders, carried rifles.
Mr. Hobbs, from the Chamber of Commerce, said he was already hearing from company executives who are uneasy about the town's prominence in the news, prompting him to worry that Springfield could lose some of its momentum.
"Change is tough," he said. "We are in that painful time of adjustment."

Former Chief Of VW Faces Fraud Trial Over Testing: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Nine years after the carmaker admitted to concealing emissions on a massive scale, Martin Winterkorn will be tried in a German court.
Almost nine years after Volkswagen admitted that it had rigged millions of cars to cheat on emissions tests, the company's former chief executive went on trial Tuesday on charges stemming from the fraud, a vast corporate conspiracy that changed the auto industry.
Martin Winterkorn, 77, who led Volkswagen from 2007 until he resigned under pressure in September 2015, appeared at a court in Braunschweig, Germany, after a judge rejected his pleas to postpone the trial because he said he was in poor health. The trial will be a test of whether German authorities can hold top executives accountable for wrongdoing that cost Volkswagen tens of billions of dollars and contributed to poor air quality in Europe and the United States.
Mr. Winterkorn, who was once Germany's highest-paid executive, faces criminal charges including fraud, market manipulation and making false statements. Prosecutors accused him of failing to notify authorities and owners of Volkswagen cars when, in 2014, he became aware of software designed to illegally cloak emissions that exceeded limits imposed by European and U.S. regulators.
With Mr. Winterkorn's knowledge, prosecutors said, Volkswagen continued to sell such vehicles until the cheating was exposed by California regulators and the Environmental Protection Agency in 2015. Over a decade, Volkswagen and its Audi, Skoda and Seat units sold nine million cars with the illicit software.
Prosecutors have also accused Mr. Winterkorn of authorizing a recall of the affected vehicles in 2014 with the purpose of preventing regulators from learning about the forbidden software. And he is accused of lying under oath to a German parliamentary committee investigating the cheating.
The market manipulation charge arises from allegations that Mr. Winterkorn failed to notify Volkswagen shareholders of the financial risk posed by the software as required by securities law.
The trial started on Tuesday, with prosecutors reading all three indictments against Mr. Winterkorn, who arrived early wearing a dark blue suit. He looked tired as the charges were read, but his lead attorney, Felix Dörr, said Mr. Winterkorn was in good health.
The case illustrates how difficult and time-consuming it can be for prosecutors to hold high-ranking corporate managers accountable for illegal activity that takes place on their watch. Mr. Winterkorn, who was known for his authoritarian management style and short fuse, has insisted that he had no knowledge of the cheating, blaming underlings for the wrongdoing.
The trial comes at an inopportune time for Volkswagen, which faces profitability problems amid increasing pressure from Asian competitors. On Monday, the carmaker warned that it would consider closing factories in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history, ending a decades-old guarantee of job security for workers.
The wheels of justice moved exceptionally slowly in Mr. Winterkorn's case. The trial was postponed repeatedly while he received treatment for knee and hip problems. But the court in Braunschweig, a city near Volkswagen's headquarters in Wolfsburg, rejected his most recent pleas to delay the proceedings.
The charges carry a maximum of 10 years in prison, although it is unusual for German judges to impose long prison sentences for white-collar crimes. Rupert Stadler, the former chief executive of Volkswagen's Audi unit, received a suspended sentence last year after he pleaded guilty to charges related to the scandal.
The illegal software that Volkswagen used recognized when a diesel vehicle's emissions system was being tested and dialed up pollution controls to comply with regulations.
At other times, the cars spewed excessive quantities of toxic nitrogen oxides, which cause asthma and other respiratory problems. The engines' emissions systems were not capable of consistently operating within legal limits.
The scandal has had long-lasting effects on the auto industry. Volkswagen and other carmakers had, for years, marketed cars that ran on diesel as cleaner alternatives to gasoline cars. They argued that diesel cars had better fuel economy, and therefore emitted less greenhouse gases.
Few people listened to environmental activists who pointed out that pollution levels in European cities were much higher than they should have been if the technology was as clean as advertised.
Volkswagen's wrongdoing, which was initially uncovered by graduate students at West Virginia University working with a $ 70,000 grant, exposed the degree to which the auto industry had obscured the hazards of diesel.
Other automakers including Fiat Chrysler, now part of Stellantis, and Mercedes-Benz paid fines to settle accusations they had also illegally concealed emissions, though none was accused of doing so on the same scale as Volkswagen, the second-largest carmaker in the world after Toyota.
The scandal prompted European authorities to tighten air quality standards and encourage sales of electric vehicles, which have surpassed diesels in popularity. Diesels once accounted for more than 50 percent of new cars in Europe, but recently accounted for 13 percent.
In the United States, Volkswagen agreed to pay $ 15 billion to settle civil and criminal claims stemming from the scandal. That included fines, compensation to owners of diesel vehicles and a fund that local governments could tap to buy electric school buses or pay for other projects to reduce air pollution. As part of the settlement, Volkswagen funded the creation of Electrify America, which operates one of the largest electric car charging networks in the country today.
Testimony in German criminal trials does not always take place on consecutive days, and the proceedings can last years. Four lower-ranking Volkswagen executives have been jointly on trial in Braunschweig since 2021. That trial is expected to last until January.
Outside the courthouse on Tuesday, Matti Holtz, a Volkswagen factory worker and a father of two, stood with others while carrying a protest poster. Mr. Holtz, who owns a Volkswagen, said he wished punishment for Mr. Winterkorn, not only for the "fraud of the customers," but also because of the "intentional poisoning of people and nature."
The court has scheduled about 90 days of testimony in Mr. Winterkorn's case, which is expected to last until September 2025.

SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — It has been more than a year since the fateful morning last August when, outside Springfield in southwestern Ohio, a minivan veered into oncoming traffic and rammed into a school bus on the first day of class, killing an 11-year-old boy and injuring 23 other children.
Soon, it emerged that the driver of the minivan was not a longtime resident but one of the thousands of immigrants from Haiti who had recently settled in the area. He was driving with a foreign license not valid in Ohio.
The stage was set for another fraught chapter in the debate over immigration in America, this one magnified because JD Vance, the state’s junior senator, would soon become the Republican vice presidential nominee.
Haitians were new to the region. During the last census, in 2020, a little more than 58,000 people lived in Springfield, a town at the crossroads of America that had fallen on hard times and shed population as opportunity slipped away. But it has changed dramatically in recent years, as a boom in manufacturing and warehouse jobs attracted a swelling wave of immigrants, mainly from Haiti. City officials estimate that as many as 20,000 Haitians have arrived, most of them since the pandemic.
At the first City Commission meeting after the bus crash, angry residents packed the chambers and demanded answers.
“How do you know we aren’t getting criminals, rapists?” a man in a blue Harley Davidson T-shirt asked. “Who can stop them from coming here?” someone else wanted to know. Had they been screened? Were they going to use their driver’s licenses to vote?
The city manager, Bryan Heck, explained that the Haitians were lawfully in the country. The police chief, Allison Elliott, said Haitians were not responsible for the city’s yearslong struggle with crime such as retail theft. Commissioners said they had come for job opportunities.
But nothing could quell the outrage.
The arrival of successive streams of immigrants has created friction throughout America’s history. In recent years, especially, people from all over the world have settled in places, like Springfield, unaccustomed to high levels of immigration.
The issue has become even more politicized this year, as the presidential election campaign focuses on the record number of crossings on the southern border in 2023. So it came as no surprise that the influx of Haitians to Springfield would become a talking point for Vance.
In a speech at the National Conservatism Conference in July, he described Springfield as a town that was nearly a carbon copy of Middletown, Ohio, where he grew up, except that it had now been “overwhelmed” by Haitians who were pushing up housing costs and collecting benefits.
“And you don’t have to believe, of course, that the 20,000, at least most of the 20,000 newcomers, are bad people” to recognize it as a problem, he said.
By most accounts, the Haitians have helped revitalize Springfield.
They are assembling car engines at Honda, running vegetable-packing machines at Dole and loading boxes at distribution centers. They are paying taxes on their wages and spending money at Walmart. On Sundays, they gather at churches for boisterous, joyful services in Haitian Creole.
But the speed and volume of arrivals have put pressure on housing, schools and hospitals. The community health clinic saw a 13-fold increase in Haitian patients between 2021 and 2023, from 115 to 1,500, overwhelming its staff and budget.
The bus crash, which killed Aiden Clark, the son of two teachers, touched off resentment that had been building for months or longer, many residents said.
“Aiden’s death was the match on the tinder bundle,” said Chris Cook, the Clark County health commissioner.
A City’s Revitalization
For decades, Springfield had been another shrinking Midwestern town with an uncertain future.
Manufacturing plants had shuttered, fueling an exodus. Empty Victorian mansions on Fountain Avenue, erected for industrial barons, stood as relics of the town’s heyday.
The population dwindled to less than 60,000 by 2014, from more than 80,000 in 1960.
Around that time, Springfield crafted a strategic plan to attract business. City leaders pitched the town’s affordability, its workforce development programs and its location, smack-dab between Columbus and Dayton and accessible to two interstates.
In 2017, Topre, a major Japanese auto parts manufacturer, picked Springfield for a new plant in a decaying part of town that had been the site of International Harvester, a farm equipment manufacturer that was once the biggest employer.
By 2020, Springfield had lured food-service firms, logistics companies and a microchip-maker, among others, creating an estimated 8,000 new jobs and optimism for the future.
“It was incredible to witness the transformation of our community,” said Horton Hobbs, vice president of economic development for the Greater Springfield Partnership, which executed the plan.
But soon there were not enough workers. Many young, working-age people had descended into addiction. Others shunned entry-level, rote work altogether, employers said.
Haitians who heard that the Springfield area boasted well-paying, blue-collar jobs and a low cost of living poured in, and employers were eager to hire and train the new workforce.
The Haitians had Social Security numbers and work permits, thanks to a federal program that offered them temporary protection in the United States. Some had been living for years in places like Florida, where there is a thriving Haitian community.
McGregor Metal, a family-owned business in Springfield that makes parts for cars, trucks and tractors, was short of workers after investing millions to boost production.
The business needed machine operators, forklift drivers and quality inspectors, said CEO Jamie McGregor.
“The Haitians were there to fill those positions,” he said. The immigrants now comprise about 10% of his workforce.
“They come to work every day. They don’t cause drama. They’re on time,” he said.
Among the Haitians recently on the second shift, which stretched to 1 a.m., was Daniel Campere, operating a robotic welder that makes axle components for Toyota trucks.
Campere, who arrived in the United States in 2013, for years earned his keep shuttling workers between the tomato fields in Florida and Georgia. Then some friends who had moved to Springfield urged him to give it a try.
He started at McGregor in June 2021 and now makes $19 an hour, with a 401(k) and health insurance.
He has been able to buy a house in Miami, which he rents out. In Springfield, he shares a house with three other Haitian men, who together pay $2,400 in rent.
Campere said he was aware of the criticism leveled at his community. “We can’t say anything. The Americans are chez eux,” he said, using the French words for “in their home.”
After a pause, he added, “We pay bills and taxes like everybody else.”
Vickie Stevens, an American worker, overheard the conversation in the break room, and shared her two cents.
“I can tell you, Daniel’s a real good worker,” she said. “He works as many hours as he can get.” She added: “We, the Americans, are just a little jealous of them.”
The Impact on Clinics and Schools
At the Rocking Horse Community Health Center, a federally subsidized clinic that does not turn away anyone, a surge in Haitians has caused a consultation that normally took 15 minutes to take as long as 45 minutes because of the language barrier.
“We lost productivity. We had a huge burnout of staff,” said Dr. Yamini Teegala, the CEO.
Six Haitian Creole speakers were hired and trained to assist newcomers. But expenditures on translation services jumped to an estimated $436,000 this year from $43,000 in 2020, she said.
“This is not sustainable,” Teegala said, adding that her priority was not to save money but to ensure quality care.
On Aug. 14, the first day of school, the Springfield City School District’s registration department was crammed with immigrant families waiting to enroll children, so many that some had to queue up in the hallway.
Nearly 350 new students registered for elementary and middle school the first week of classes, most of them children of immigrants.
The school district has hired about two dozen teachers who are certified to teach English as a second language and several Haitian-Creole interpreters, thanks to federal and state pandemic-related funds. The immigrant students have boosted enrollment after years of decline, and enriched the learning environment, said Pam Shay, director of federal programs.
But she expressed concern about the 2025-26 academic year. “It’s going to get very tight,” she said.
Springfield, like many towns, is also struggling with a dearth of affordable housing for low-income families, and the Haitian influx has not helped.
On July 8, Heck, the city manager, cited the arrivals in a letter to the leaders of the Senate Banking Committee requesting federal help. He copied Vance.
The next day, at a committee meeting, Vance questioned Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about the relationship between “high illegal immigration levels under the Biden administration” and rising housing costs.
Vance referenced Springfield, saying it “highlights a very real example of this particular concern.”
Michelle Lee-Hall, executive director of Springfield’s housing authority, said the affordability problem had been aggravated by landlords pivoting to Haitians who were willing to pay higher rent.
Landlords have withdrawn about 200 properties from a federal housing-voucher program for low-income families, she said.
“Here in Springfield, the new homeless are people who can’t afford to pay $2,000 or $3,000 a month in rent,” she said.
Gary Durst, who buys and refurbishes distressed homes, has 400 units in his portfolio, and about 80% of the tenants are Haitian.
He acknowledged that some Americans have been displaced. But on many streets, newly renovated homes are giving blighted neighborhoods a face-lift, he said. No longer delinquent on property tax, they pump revenue into Springfield’s coffers.
“I probably have $25 million invested in this town,” Durst said. “I believe in this town.”
A Fatal Crash
The accident that inflamed tensions happened last Aug. 22, when the school bus, carrying 52 students, lumbered down Route 41 outside of town. A 2010 Honda Odyssey moving in the opposite direction jumped across the center divider and into the bus’s path.
The bus driver tried to maneuver away but could not avert a collision. The bus plunged off the side of the road, and Aiden was thrown out of an emergency hatch as the bus flipped over and then landed on him. The boy was pronounced dead at the scene. More than 20 other children were taken to the hospital.
A lawyer for the minivan driver, Hermanio Joseph, 36, said at his trial in April that the sun had blinded him. Joseph, who has a spouse and four children in Haiti, had been living in Springfield for more than a year, working at a warehouse.
Police officers found no evidence of drug or alcohol consumption. But Joseph was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and he could spend nine years behind bars.
The tragedy shook Springfield residents, and it emboldened many who crowded the first City Commission meeting after the accident to air long-held suspicions and grievances about the newcomers in their midst.
In the year since the crash, hostility toward the Haitians has only intensified, with speakers at more recent commission meetings talking about an “invasion,” a description that has become a staple of right-wing immigration rhetoric.
At a meeting on July 30, residents stepped up to two podiums in a session that quickly devolved into chaos.
“Haitians are occupying our land,” declared one middle-aged woman, Glenda Bailey, warning that the immigrants would soon become the majority and run everyone else out of town. She said they had low IQs.
Speakers claimed, without evidence, that Haitians were responsible for drug trafficking, retail theft and disease.
“Not one person asked anyone in this community how we felt about them coming in here and invading our city,” said one resident, Mike Powell.
Korge Mori, the child of Japanese immigrants, was among a handful of residents who lauded the Haitians. He scolded the mayor and the city manager for “whipping up mass hysteria” during a recent appearance on “Fox & Friends” in which they had blamed President Joe Biden’s policies for the Haitians taxing their city.
“There was a time, not too long ago, when we were a dying city, hemorrhaging people and jobs to other places. And the good Lord heard our prayers, and brought us the gift of the Haitian immigrant community,” he said.
The drama has not been confined to the City Commission chambers.
On a recent Saturday, about a dozen Nazi sympathizers — masked men in matching red shirts, black pants and boots — waved swastika flags as they marched in downtown Springfield near a jazz festival. At least two of the men, who authorities said were outsiders, carried rifles.
Hobbs, from the Chamber of Commerce, said he was already hearing from company executives who are uneasy about the town’s prominence in the news, prompting him to worry that Springfield could lose some of its momentum.
“Change is tough,” he said. “We are in that painful time of adjustment.”

Full text: The authorities said the storm could produce a large-scale disaster as it approached the mainland. Nearly 1 million people were told to evacuate, and Toyota closed all its factories on Wednesday afternoon.
[Follow the latest coverage of Typhoon Shanshan .]
Typhoon Shanshan made landfall Thursday morning in southern Japan, bringing strong winds and high waves to the area, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.
According to the agency, the typhoon made landfall at around 8 a.m. local time near Satsumasendai City in Kagoshima prefecture.
Nearly a million people in Japan remained under evacuation orders Thursday morning as Typhoon Shanshan delivered hurricane-force winds, torrential rain and the threat of landslides, with the authorities warning that the storm could produce a large-scale disaster.
Meteorological officials issued rare emergency warnings for the powerful storm as it churned north along the shore of Kyushu, the southernmost main island of Japan, on Thursday. Waves towered nearly 30 feet high in southern Kyushu on Thursday, and wind speeds of up to 45 meters per second were predicted, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. Record-breaking rainfall in the Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures were expected over the next several days.
Emergency warnings were issued for storm surge and high waves in Kagoshima Prefecture, and are the highest category of warnings possible in Japan. Such advisories are usually only issued once every few decades in a given region, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. With a risk of tornadoes in the prefecture on Thursday morning, the agency cautioned people to pay attention to the sky and move inside to sturdy buildings.
97
Parts of the country far from the typhoon, mainly in western Japan and the Pacific Ocean side of eastern Japan, were experiencing heavy rain and thunder early on Thursday morning because of the storm, forecasters said. Emergency landslide warnings were issued in several prefectures.
In Aichi Prefecture, in central Japan, a family of five was buried on Wednesday after a landslide toppled their house. Three of them were confirmed dead, the public broadcaster NHK reported on Thursday. The authorities believe the victims were a couple in their 70s and their son in his 30s. Two daughters survived, but one sustained serious injuries, NHK reported.
Shanshan may make landfall in Kyushu by Friday, the agency said. The storm weakened as it skirted the coast Thursday morning, but its slow pace means it will lash some areas with relentless rain for hours, elevating threats of flooding.
In southern Kyushu, the authorities warned that winds could topple some homes, and that the rain could cause flash flooding and landslides. The authorities issued evacuation orders for about 990,000 people across southern, western and central Japan on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Eight cities and towns, mostly on the Amami Islands south of the mainland, had ordered residents to evacuate, NHK reported. More than 234,000 customers were without power in Kyushu on Thursday morning, the Kyushu Electric Power Transmission and Distribution company said. The utility said that it had set up a disaster team to respond to the outages.
Toyota announced that it would pause production at all 14 of its Japan factories starting Wednesday evening, to protect the safety of its workers. Shiro Tachimoto, a company representative, said the company would reassess on Thursday morning whether to keep the factories closed or reopen them.
Japan Airlines said that it had canceled some Wednesday flights that had been scheduled to arrive or depart from some airports in central Japan, including Osaka Kansai Airport, one of the country's largest. In a statement on its website early Thursday morning, the airline said its international flights were "expected to operate as usual," but were subject to change because of the typhoon. All Nippon Airlines, the country's largest airline, said it had canceled some Friday flights at Osaka airport.
Japan's high-speed rail network, the Shinkansen, suspended some trains on Wednesday, and its operators warned that services could be disrupted into the weekend. Toll and expressway operators lifted some earlier closures but warned residents to check traffic information this week before traveling. Postal services were also disrupted at some counters on Wednesday, according to Japan Post, and cellphone services were down in parts of the Kagoshima Prefecture, according to one provider.
The powerful storm had sustained winds of up to 97 miles per hour on Thursday, equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane, according to the U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center. In some cities in central and eastern Japan, up to 10 inches of rain fell in a 24-hour window from Tuesday into Wednesday. Some cities in Japan saw winds of up to 86 miles per hour, equivalent to those of a Category 1 hurricane.
At some point, after moving northwest along the coast during the day Thursday, the typhoon will likely turn back east. However, precisely when or where that will occur remains unclear.
Heavy rain is expected to continue after Friday, the Japan Meteorological Agency, said, when the region could see a record-breaking 39 inches of rain, mainly in southern Kyushu. Japan last issued emergency warnings for Typhoon Nanmadol, a 2022 storm that brought torrential rain and landslides to Kyushu. More than eight million people were ordered to evacuate.
The start of the Pacific typhoon season this year has seen a lower number of tropical storms than average, in part because of the La Niña weather pattern that is predicted to arrive later this summer, according to the U.S. National Weather Service.
La Niña, which is defined by cooler equatorial sea surface temperatures, typically increases wind shear -- changes in wind speed and direction -- in the central Pacific region, which makes it harder for storms to develop, the Weather Service said in May.

Man Is Charged With Arson In Fire That Burned 13 Homes: [National Desk]

Full text: The Thompson fire also burned over 3,700 acres and forced the evacuation of 26,000 residents.
A 26-year-old California man was arrested last week on arson charges in connection with the Thompson fire in July, which destroyed 13 homes, burned over 3,700 acres and forced the evacuation of 26,000 people, according to the law enforcement agencies.
The man, Spencer Grant Anderson, who was taken into custody on Aug. 22, was arraigned on Monday and is being held without bail in Butte County Jail.
The Thompson fire began on July 2 when Mr. Anderson threw a "flaming object" out the window of a car he was driving just north of Oroville, where he lives, according to a news release issued Monday by the Butte County District Attorney's Office.
On the day the fire began, investigators with Cal Fire, the state's firefighting agency, pinpointed where the fire had originated and learned from 911 callers and witnesses that a Toyota sedan had been spotted there at the time, the prosecutor's office said.
The next day, they found the Toyota and identified Mr. Anderson as the driver and potential arsonist, according to the release.
Investigators monitored and investigated Mr. Anderson for 50 days before arresting him, prosecutors said.
After his arrest, Mr. Anderson admitted that he had purchased fireworks from a stand in Oroville and tested one by throwing it out of his car window, according to the release.
District Attorney Mike Ramsey did not immediately return a phone message on Monday seeking comment.
Mr. Anderson is charged with arson of an inhabited structure, arson of forest land, and arson causing multiple structures to burn.
"It was a long investigation, there was a lot moving parts to it," Larry Pilgrim, Mr. Anderson's attorney, said to The New York Times on Monday. "He is just being accused at this point."
He added that "it's too early to pass judgment."
If convicted on all charges, Mr. Anderson could face more than 21 years in prison, prosecutors said. He has a previous felony conviction related to domestic violence, according to the news release from the Butte County District Attorney's Office, which it said could double the punishment of any possible arson conviction.

Full text: Winning at the Games sometimes brings unexpected rewards.
Everyone knows what you get when you are faster, higher or stronger than anyone else at the Olympics. A gold medal.
And if you are lucky, maybe also some money -- and in some places, a buffalo or a free colonoscopy.
Pakistan has been sending athletes to the Olympics since 1948 and, before this year, had won three gold medals, all in men's field hockey. But individual gold had been elusive. And the country had qualified only seven athletes for the 2024 Games.
One of them was the javelin thrower Arshad Nadeem, who had placed second a year ago in the World Athletics Championships and was a serious contender to win. Sure enough, he hurled the javelin 305 feet, longer than the distance between the goal lines of a football field, to set an Olympic record.
That earned him a gold medal and his moment with the Pakistani national anthem on the podium. But it also earned him a buffalo.
Nadeem's father-in-law, Muhammad Nawaz, offered him the animal. Nadeem is from a rural part of Punjab Province, where such a gift is considered an honor.
"He could have given me five acres of land. But then I said, 'OK, fine,' he gave me a buffalo, that is also nice," Nadeem said, according to The Hindustan Times.
And the gifts did not stop with the buffalo. A businessman gave Nadeem a Suzuki Alto, a small Japanese car, which prompted some commenters to say that he deserved a finer vehicle, the Indian news source The Print reported. He got 150 million Pakistani rupees (roughly $ 500,000) from local governments. There were also promises of naming a sports academy and a stadium for him.
For his part, Nadeem has leveraged his public prominence to advocate that a women's university be placed in his hometown, Mian Channu. Currently, women there must travel at least two hours to get to a higher education institution.
The Philippines is another country without an enormous amount of success at the Olympics: just one gold medal before this year.
So patriotic citizens lined up to promise gifts and prizes to Carlos Yulo, a gymnast who won both the floor exercise and the vault. Among them, the Philippine news site Rappler reported, were a three-bedroom apartment, a Toyota Land Cruiser, free food for life from several restaurants and free colonoscopies or other endoscopic procedures. (The doctor volunteering that prize offered to shift it to "indigent patients of your choosing.")
Yulo was also promised at least 50 million Philippine pesos (about $ 900,000) from various government agencies and well-heeled sport fans.
It is not uncommon for countries, especially ones without decades of Olympic success, to offer a range of incentives and rewards for gold. In 2021, the Indonesian badminton gold medalists Greysia Polii and Apriyani Rahayu were offered cash, a house and franchises in a chain of meatball restaurants.
There were no meatballs on offer at the ancient Olympic Games in Greece starting in 776 B.C. Winners were presented with a crown of olive leaves.
Not a free colonoscopy, but it's something.

Chain Loved Across Japan Faces Buyout: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Convenience stores are a part of the country's culture, meaning that the foreign buyout bid for 7-Eleven, the largest chain, could be a hard sell in Japan.
In Japan, convenience stores are celebrated. Clean and bright, they are stocked with fresh and affordable lunchboxes, steamed buns and stews in the winter. The celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain once called them "the one vice" he couldn't give up.
For many residents, the more than 55,000 cheerful, jingle-filled stores, known as konbini, are an indispensable part of daily life. Millions flock to the stores daily to pick up food, send packages and pay bills.
Japan's largest konbini chain, 7-Eleven, is also its most famous. It is understandable that a rival company wants in on the action.
This week, Seven & i Holdings, the Japanese company that operates 7-Eleven, said it had received an unsolicited takeover proposal from Alimentation Couche-Tard, a convenience store giant in Canada.
The status of 7-Eleven stores as a cornerstone of Japanese society also means Japan probably will not be willing to part with them, despite increasing pressure on the nation's corporations to demonstrate openness to foreign-led acquisitions.
7-Eleven is "one of the best brick-and-mortar retail businesses in the world," said Hiroaki Watanabe, an independent retail analyst. Selling 7-Eleven to Couche-Tard would be, for Japan, "equivalent to Toyota becoming a foreign company," he said.
In fact, 7-Eleven started out an American convenience store chain, operated by Southland Corporation, in Dallas in 1927. It opened its first store in Japan in 1974, featuring popular American items like hamburgers. It was an instant success in Japan and within two years had expanded to 100 stores.
In 1991, a Japanese supermarket operator, Ito-Yokado, and 7-Eleven Japan acquired 70 percent of Southland's shares. In 2005, 7-Eleven became wholly Japanese-owned through a holding company, Seven & i.
Today, Seven & i has more than 21,000 7-Eleven stores in Japan and operates in 20 countries and territories. In the United States, Seven & i has been exploring ways to replicate the much-coveted Japanese convenience store experience. One possibility: Introduce ramen noodles.
In contrast to Japanese konbini stores, North American convenience stores are often seen as places for packaged snacks, drinks and, in many cases, gasoline. Convenience-store hot foods typically evoke images of a solitary hot dog spinning for hours on end in an induction oven.
Couche-Tard, based in Quebec, operates many of these convenience stores in the United States under its Circle K brand.
The company runs more than 16,000 stores and gas stations in North America and Europe. Like Seven & i, the Canadian retailer has sought further growth abroad. In 2021, it tried to acquire the French grocery store operator Carrefour -- an effort that regulators eventually shot down.
Japan has long been a part of Couche-Tard's global ambitions. Should Couche-Tard's acquisition succeed, it would not only represent the largest foreign-led acquisition of a Japanese company but also create one of the world's largest retail groups.
After news of Couche-Tard's preliminary takeover bid, Seven & i announced that it had established an independent special committee to review the offer.
Analysts point to significant obstacles that would probably make the buyout of Seven & i a long shot.
For one, Seven & i is a conglomerate with businesses beyond convenience stores, including banking and carrier services. The holding company's reach opens the acquisition to more intense scrutiny from the Japanese government.
There are also big differences in the way Couche-Tard and Seven & i operate convenience stores.
Japanese konbini operators are known for their swift development of new products -- such as themed goods available only during the fleeting cherry-blossom season. A typical convenience store in Japan offers about 3,000 products, 70 percent of which are replaced annually, according to Mr. Watanabe, the analyst.
A large portion of Seven & i's operating profit comes from its Japanese convenience stores, and Couche-Tard would need to present a compelling proposal showing how it could improve that core business, he said.
Mr. Watanabe once made a two-week drive across the United States, studying convenience stores along the way -- and was unimpressed. Any takeover proposal for 7-Eleven would be challenging because Japanese convenience stores are "completely different and unique," he said.
The first 7-Eleven store in Japan opened in 1974 in a quiet bayside neighborhood in eastern Tokyo. On Friday morning, it was bustling with office workers, students and parents with young children in tow.
Sakura Kobayashi, 23, who works in the neighborhood, stopped in to buy a salad and an onigiri rice ball -- a specialty in Japanese convenience stores. The foods at 7-Eleven have a taste that feels "familiar" to her and her colleagues, she said.
Outside a 7-Eleven in central Tokyo, Yuta Matsumura, a 26-year-old office worker, ate a cream-filled pancake dessert he had just bought. He said he typically stopped in a 7-Eleven at least three times a week, sometimes to buy lunch items like beef rice bowls.
But it is really the sweets that lure Mr. Matsumura in. "They're not too sweet, like we Japanese like," he said. "7-Eleven desserts are the best."

Canada Calls Arbitration In Rail Strife: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The shutdown had threatened to disrupt trade with the United States and other countries, as well as cause serious economic consequences in Canada.
Less than 17 hours after almost all rail freight traffic in Canada came to a standstill Thursday following a lockout by the country's two main rail companies of 10,000 employees, the federal government told a labor board to end the shutdown and ordered arbitration.
The lockout had threatened to cause supply-chain disruptions in the United States and serious economic consequences within Canada. The moves followed months of contract talks that had failed to reach an agreement.
Steve MacKinnon, Canada's labor minister, said at a news conference in Ottawa on Thursday that he had told the Canada Industrial Relations Board to formally order the railways to restart service. He said that he expected trains would be rolling "within days."
He also told the labor board to extend the contracts between the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference -- the union that represents the workers locked out -- and the railway companies: Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Kansas City. The contracts expired at the end of the last year.
"The impacts of the current impasse are being borne by all Canadians," Mr. MacKinnon said at the news conference. "Millions of Canadians rely on our railways every day."
Last week, the two railway companies had asked Mr. MacKinnon to impose arbitration before a Thursday deadline for a strike or lockout. Mr. MacKinnon turned them down then, but he said on Thursday that the situation had changed.
"We gave negotiations every possible opportunity to succeed," Mr. MacKinnon said. "But we have an impasse here."
For Canada's export-dependent economy, a prolonged shutdown could have brought severe economic repercussions. The railway association estimates that half of all Canadian exports are moved on trains and that railroads carried 380 billion Canadian dollars, about $ 279 billion, worth of goods during 2022.
About 6,500 containers enter the United States by rail from Canada every day along with other cargo, according to the Railway Association of Canada, an industry lobbying group. Many of those containers have come from Asia and Europe and landed at Canadian ports.
The effects of a protracted strike would have been felt throughout the world. Canada is a major exporter of several globally important commodities. Canadian mines are the world's largest source of potash, an important fertilizer, and virtually all of their production moves by train at some point.
The temporary lockout did not, however, affect Canadian National's extensive operations in the United States or Canadian Pacific Kansas City's lines in the United States and Mexico.
The effect on intercity passenger trains, which mostly use Canadian National's tracks, and on commuter lines was less pronounced on Thursday. And while the railways move grains and other farm products for global export, they transport relatively few of the food products found in Canadian grocery stores.
In 2015, a two-day strike by 3,000 locomotive engineers at Canadian Pacific -- as the company was known before it acquired an American competitor, Kansas City Southern, last year -- ended with the two sides agreeing to arbitration hours before the then-Conservative government introduced back-to-work legislation. In 2019, workers at Canadian National struck for eight days before negotiating a deal.
In recent decades, the two companies' labor contracts had previously expired on alternating years, which avoided a near-total rail shutdown. But to accommodate changing federal regulations, Canadian National secured a one-year extension of its last agreement. The contracts with both companies expired at the end of last year. Negotiations began last September.
The main points of contention for the railway workers appear to be scheduling, work hours and fatigue management. Hunter Harrison, a longtime American railway executive who ran both railways at separate times, introduced a system known as precision-scheduled railroading. To boost efficiency, he put trains on rigid, consistent schedules and cut back on equipment and employees through steps like running extremely long trains.
His approach bolstered profits, and the legacy of Mr. Harrison, who died in 2017, remains significantly intact at both railways.
In June, the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference said the two railways were "trying to squeeze even more availability" out of workers. It said that would mean "train crews would be forced to stay awake even longer, increasing the risk of derailments and other accidents."
"The railroads don't care about farmers, small businesses, supply chains or their own employees," Paul Boucher, the rail conference's president, said in a statement on Thursday. "Their sole focus is boosting their bottom line, even if it means jeopardizing the entire economy."
Canadian National said in a recent statement that it had proposed "a modernized agreement that improved safety, wages and work/life balance." Canadian Pacific Kansas City said its offer "does not in any way compromise safety."
In a brief statement after the government's orders, Canadian National also said that while it was satisfied that the shutdown was ending, it was "disappointed that a negotiated deal could not be achieved at the bargaining table."
The Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau keeps its hold on power in the House of Commons with the voting support of the New Democratic Party, which was partly founded by organized labor. Meeting with rail workers in Montreal on Thursday, Jagmeet Singh, that party's leader, again warned Mr. Trudeau against passing legislation that would force rail employees to return to work or imposing arbitration.
Mr. Singh condemned the government's arbitration announcement in a social media post.
"Justin Trudeau's actions are cowardly, anti-worker, & proof that he will always cave to corporate greed," he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
The effects of a long shutdown would have most likely stretched across several sectors of Canada's economy, including agriculture, mining, forestry, oil and manufacturing.
Many shippers who use rail freight in Canada cannot simply move their cargo to trucks. Ships are not an alternative outside of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River system. And the overwhelming majority of cars and trucks made in Canada are sent to the United States largely by train.
"Parts and components come into the plants largely via trucks, and finished vehicles go out largely on rails," said David Adams, the president and chief executive of Global Automakers of Canada, a group that includes Honda and Toyota. Both companies have major operations in Canada. "There would be very limited, if any, capability to transfer finished vehicle shipments from rail to truck."
Wade Sobkowich, the executive director of the Western Grain Elevator Association, said before the government's action that the shutdown had come just as his members were starting to purchase this year's grain harvest from farmers. The job action, he said, meant farmers had to stockpile their grain and wait to be paid.
"We tend not to bring in grain unless we know we can load it onto a train and get it out," he said from Winnipeg. "It's terrible timing, right at the start of harvest. We'll be playing catch up for the rest of the year."
Via Rail Canada, the government-owned passenger system, said in an email that most of its trains, which run mainly on Canadian National's tracks, would be unaffected. Dispatchers at Canadian National remain on the job, unlike their counterparts at Canadian Pacific Kansas City.
Exo, a commuter rail service in the Montreal area, shut down service on three lines owned by Canadian Pacific Kansas City that carry about 24,000 passengers a day.
Metrolinx, which runs commuter services in the Toronto area, had said that most of its trains travel on Canadian National's lines and would not be affected by the lockout. It canceled service, however, on a single route that carries about 6,000 passengers a day.
In British Columbia, commuter rail service is suspended on a line that runs to and from the former Canadian Pacific station on Vancouver's waterfront. TransLink, its operator, estimates that the route carries 3,000 passengers on weekdays.

Full text: Sarah McCreanor, or Smac, has attracted millions of followers with her reproductions of the weird-yet-familiar images and memes that shape internet culture.
Like comedians, dancers tend to be good imitators. They're both masters of fine detail, able to pinpoint and replicate the minutiae that make a choreographic phrase, or a sketch character, click into focus.
As a dancer and a comedian, Sarah McCreanor, known as Smac, likes to up the ante. Why mimic a dance or a person when you can turn yourself into an emoji? A head-bobbing chicken? An object being crushed by a hydraulic press?
"I think one of the funniest things you can do is try to dance the undanceable," McCreanor said in a Zoom interview. "I look at, like, a video of a hydraulic press crushing something, and I see choreography."
You have to go back a generation or two to find a good analogue for the 32-year-old McCreanor. Her physical comedy evokes the vaudevillian slapstick of Donald O'Connor or Lucille Ball. But she's figured out how to translate that fundamentally retro style for a very online audience. On her TikTok and Instagram accounts, where she calls herself "a variety show," she's attracted millions of followers with her dancerly reproductions of the weird-yet-familiar images and memes that shape internet culture.
Recently, McCreanor even earned the endorsement of the venerable National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia. (She grew up in Brisbane, though she now lives in Los Angeles.) The museum featured a large assortment of McCreanor's social media videos in "Hydraulic Press Girl," part of its Triennial exhibition.
It might have been the funniest Smac moment yet: austere gallery walls filled with elegant screens, on which McCreanor was turning herself into the eggplant emoji or a smushed roll of Lifesavers. Christopher Guerrero, who teaches a course on viral comedy at the University of Southern California, said it felt akin to the Dada antics of the artist Marcel Duchamp.
"When you put this kind of content into a stringent museum space," Guerrero said, "that's so Dada."
McCreanor said that before the exhibition, she hadn't thought to take her videos seriously. (She still doesn't, really: the goal, she said, remains "to crack people up.") But they're underpinned by serious dance technique, as well as training in theater, visual art and comedy.
Dance came first. Her mother put her in classes when she was 5, hoping they would help her overcome her shyness. A few years later, McCreanor and a friend concocted a jokey routine for the dance studio's talent competition. "We were bonking heads and doing slapstick stuff, just playtime," McCreanor said. The number proved so popular the studio began bringing it to local dance competitions. "We won every single one," McCreanor said. "And I've basically been making things like that ever since."
McCreanor found that she most admired dance artists who used movement as a form of wit: O'Connor, Bob Fosse. ("Fosse is absolutely comedy to me," she said. "His timing!") She also identified a kindred spirit in Mr. Bean, a k a Rowan Atkinson, whose wordless buffoonery is deceptively well choreographed.
As she grew up, she started performing in musicals and watching live comedy shows. In high school and college, she studied visual art. "I chose it specifically because I knew they'd let me get away with everything I wanted to do," she said. "I could dance, write, direct, perform, and it could all be labeled 'visual art."'
At 18, McCreanor left college to join a touring stage version of the film "How to Train Your Dragon." The tour brought her to Los Angeles, where she decided to stay -- with no plans, but plenty of curiosity about the entertainment world. "I've never really had a dream job, except to be performing somehow," she said.
Though she got an array of dance and music video gigs, television commercials were her bread and butter. She estimates that she's acted and danced in nearly 70 ads, including spots for Google, Apple, Jockey, Kohl's, Toyota, Honda and KFC.
McCreanor found a kind of freedom in the overtly transactional nature of advertising. "The whole game of it fascinates me," she said. "When you're in a commercial, you're very important, and yet you're also not at all important. Talent is so little of it. Ninety percent is just, you had the right hair color." She learned how to figure out what producers were looking for, become that person if she could, and not let it upset her if she couldn't.
But eventually she tired of being a cog, even if a well-paid one. In 2019 McCreanor tried out for the television series "So You Think You Can Dance," excited as much by the chance to choreograph her own audition solo as by the thought of reality-TV fame. Her gonzo "Boogie Wonderland" number -- think Napoleon Dynamite's dance performance, if Napoleon could actually dance -- was completely unlike the other auditioners' glossy routines. Though she didn't make it to the show's top 20, her choreography knocked the judges' socks off. After it was posted online, it delighted a big chunk of the internet, too.
"That was my first experience going viral, which was thrilling because that solo was all me," McCreanor said. "It was a huge motivator for me to get back to sharing my own ideas instead of working other peoples' jobs."
Her epiphany was well-timed. A few months later, Covid's arrival wiped out conventional performance opportunities, and McCreanor suddenly had lots of time to play on social media. Though she wasn't interested in the dance challenges then sweeping TikTok -- "I knew early on that I didn't just want to do other peoples' trends," she said -- she was keen to figure out what else made the app tick.
She hadn't forgotten the lessons she'd learned from advertising. Malia Baker, a dancer and friend of McCreanor's, said McCreanor has a natural gift for targeting an audience. "She knows what ideas are going to hook people, but somehow it never feels calculated," Baker said.
Many of McCreanor's posts feature ingenious imitations of other, already-viral videos. The hydraulic press series, in which she mimics strangely mesmerizing clips of unlikely objects being squashed, has been a huge TikTok hit. Goofy animals, one of the internet's favorite subjects, are other frequent duet partners. Baker often pops up in McCreanor's "ChickTok" series, which copies the amusingly dance-like bobs and bounces of a very popular flock of Italian chickens.
The videos are fun partly because they're unpolished, with whatever is in the closet costumes and plenty of bloopers. "It's all very high school drama department D.I.Y.," McCreanor said. But her obvious skills as a performer bring a degree of integrity to the silliness, said Sophie Prince, a curator at the National Gallery of Victoria.
"It's held up by what you can just tell is 10,000 hours of experience," Prince said. When McCreanor makes her body into various logos for her blithely ridiculous "logo performance art" series, for example, the angle of her Nike check mark is precisely right. And her videos are in some ways museum friendly. Their clean aesthetic -- simple white backgrounds, straight-on camera angles -- lends them a pop-art gloss.
McCreanor said her "mind was blown" by the National Gallery of Victoria exhibition. As a visual arts student, she'd hoped for just that kind of recognition. It's both funny and slightly subversive that she got there by making internet memes. "She didn't realize that the tools that she was using might be perceivable and appreciated by the art world," Prince said.
On the other hand, given the scale of McCreanor's online popularity -- her videos have collectively earned more than a billion views -- the museum might have gotten the better end of the deal.
"She didn't need us," Prince said. "We're lucky to have shown her work."
Like the museum scene, the professional dance scene can get mired in its own earnestness. Baker thinks many dance artists would be happier if they followed McCreanor's example, using humor to pop the balloon of self-importance.
"Dancers tend to make themselves miserable because the stakes get so high, and they're so critical of themselves," she said. "Not taking herself seriously has really become Smac's superpower."
There's an innocence to that lack of self-seriousness, too. McCreanor's videos are aimed at a general audience, but her National Gallery of Victoria exhibit pulled in children like a magnet. "It's that Mr. Bean thing," McCreanor said. "There are no words, it's just a body, and so it's global -- everyone understands, everybody gets the joke." She envisions herself moving into children's entertainment.
Whatever the audience, McCreanor's work is going to be physical, and it's going to be funny.
"I'm clearly biased," she said, "but I just think dance is way better if it has humor in it."

Full text: Celebrations marking the third year since the U.S. withdrawal are amplifying a divide in Afghanistan over what principles it should be governed by.
The parade of cars rolled through Kabul from morning until night, clogging the streets in end-to-end traffic. Crowds of Taliban and their supporters lined the routes, chanting "God is great!" and "Long live the mujahedeen!" One truck dragged an American flag, a red X drawn across its stars and stripes.
Outside the old U.S. embassy, young children -- maybe 6 or 7 years old -- wearing military fatigues stood on the top of a gray Toyota pickup, clutching small white Taliban flags. A dozen others crammed into the back of the truck, white flags draped over their shoulders. Yet more flags were stapled onto wooden poles, waving in the air.
"Our way is jihad!" a man shouted through a loudspeaker from the passenger seat. The children responded: "Long live jihad!"
With August in Afghanistan come weeks of celebrations marking the anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal -- the last American planes peeled off the runway at Kabul's international airport on Aug. 30, 2021 -- and the Taliban's return to power.
The month has become a time of victors and vanquished, the swell of white flags marking conquered territory, just as past empires planted their own banners. It is also a time of heightened emotions, seeming to amplify the gulf between those who support the Taliban's conservative rule and those who embraced the liberal ideals of the U.S.-backed Afghan government.
The country remains deeply divided over fundamental questions of what principles it should be governed by, and what ideals it should hold. The only point of consensus seems to be that three years into Taliban rule -- with its extreme version of Shariah law -- it is here to stay.
As ordinary Afghans have adjusted to their new reality, so too have Taliban fighters. Once scrappy insurgents crafting homemade explosives and plotting ambushes from mountain hide-outs, they now serve as traffic cops, security guards and government bureaucrats. Many can count on one hand the number of times they have fired their weapons in the past three years, each one a celebration of sorts -- the Eid holiday or a winning match for Afghanistan's national cricket team.
Among the Talibs who have come out on the streets to celebrate, there has been a palpable itch for a return to jihad and martyrdom -- the only way to live an honorable life, many say, and a guiding belief instilled in them since they were children in Taliban-run madrassas.
"In these three years, we are fixing the roads, helping other people, but we want to continue the jihad," Panjshiri Shinwari, 27, said on Wednesday when the celebrations commenced. A Taliban fighter who joined the movement during the U.S.-led war, he now works for the government's intelligence agency, the General Directorate of Intelligence.
He and a group of friends had joined the celebrations at Mahmood Khan Bridge, which stretches over the Kabul River, now a dry channel of weeds and sewage.
"I want to go to Palestine," Mr. Shinwari continued. "We are all ready to continue our jihad in Palestine!"
"No, it's Pakistan's turn," another young Talib, Ashiqullah Naziri, 19, piped in.
"Our first enemy is Pakistan. They destroyed our country," he added, referring to the support that Pakistani authorities gave to American troops in Afghanistan. "We can't just leave them alone after that!"
As they spoke, a swell of young Talibs converged around them. Most wore cargo pants, American-made combat boots and black long-sleeve T-shirts with a faded logo of what looked like an American commando stamped on its shoulder. The Talibs' embrace of the style of American soldiers is just one of the many ways the country has been turned on its head since the takeover.
"For jihad!" one of them yelled. The crowd cheered.
The anniversary celebrations span the country. In Kandahar, the Taliban's southern heartland, a convoy of armored cars from the emir's special protection force paraded through the city on Wednesday. In Helmand Province, another stronghold, a procession of motorcycles carrying the Taliban's flag rode through the capital. And at Bagram Air Base, once America's largest military post in Afghanistan, a procession of repurposed American tanks, armored vehicles and helicopters took over the runway.
In Kabul, the celebratory convoy of cars -- a mix of government-owned and private vehicles -- crawled around the city's main squares. Many had large flags hanging out of all four windows, a version of the Shahadah, or the Muslim profession of faith, embossed on the white fabric. As the summer breeze picked up, the flags grew taut and the Arabic words decipherable.
At the Mahmood Khan roundabout, a Taliban policeman sat in the passenger seat of his forest green Ford Ranger, singing a tarana -- a religious chant with a melody but no musical accompaniment -- into a loudspeaker. A group had surrounded his vehicle, small flags tucked into the folds of their black turbans.
"The candle of success and freedom came back to our country! The sun of freedom came again to our sky!" the man sang. "Congratulations to all Afghans, independence has come again!" The Talibs in the crowd held their cellphones in the air, taking videos during the song.
But for other Afghans in the city, its lyrics rang hollow.
"It is a black day for Afghans," said Esmatullah, 25, a doctor who is among Afghanistan's Hazara ethnic minority, which was persecuted by the Pashtun-dominated Taliban during their first time running the country, in the 1990s. "I felt like a migrant today, like I was not in my country," he added.
Esmatullah, who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retribution for speaking against the government, is trying to avoid the celebrations. He said they served as a reminder not of Afghanistan earning its freedom, but of being conquered by Pashtuns.
Still, for many ordinary Afghans who suffered at the hands of foreign and Afghan republic soldiers, the anniversary is not so much a celebration of the current government as it is of the end of two decades of war.
"War is gone, death is gone," said Barakatullah Azizi, 23.
Mr. Azizi's three brothers all joined the Taliban during the war, he said, while he worked as a shopkeeper in Kabul to earn money for his family. One of his brothers, Mansour Azizi, was killed nine years ago in an ambush by Afghan republic soldiers.
His brother's death haunted him for months, he said. Every day, when he saw republic soldiers in the capital, he wondered which of them had killed his brother, and from whom he should seek revenge.
Now, he says, he walks through the city streets at ease.
"There is peace," he said. "That's what we are celebrating."

Buildup of Yen Exposed Japan Markets' Fragility: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The fragility of a more-than-yearlong stock rally in Japan, fueled in part by a weak yen, has been exposed by the sudden strengthening of the currency.
Over the past week, markets tumbled as fears ricocheted around the world about the health of the U.S. economy, tech sector and more. No market bore the brunt as much as Japan.
A key Japanese stock index, starting last Thursday, experienced its most severe two- and three-day trading drops since the 1950s -- declines that analysts said could not be fully explained by the same factors affecting other countries.
Japan had one unique element exacerbating its problems. Its weakened currency, which had been inflating corporate profits and valuations, was beginning to appreciate at an alarming rate.
The turmoil has threatened one of the most enduring stock rallies in Japan in decades. Many reasons have been given for the strong performance of Japanese stocks starting early last year. Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway expressed optimism about Japan as an alternative investment to China. The Tokyo Stock Exchange ramped up pressure on companies to enhance shareholder returns.
However, as the yen strengthened over the past week, it erased much of the gains Japanese stocks had accrued this year. Investors have been left reassessing whether the much-hailed renaissance in Japanese equities was a result more of a weakened yen than of underlying structural changes.
"Why was the rapid downturn so much worse in Japan than in other markets? The yen is top of hierarchy," said Stefan Angrick, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in Japan. "Japan's rally ultimately had a lot to do with the yen, and what happened over the past few days has been a good reminder of that."
The weak yen played a crucial role over the past few years in supporting the shares of major Japanese companies, especially exporters that saw the value of their earnings overseas boosted. Many of Japan's signature global brands, including Toyota Motor, reported record profits. That drew money from investors and drove Japanese indexes to record highs.
The yen's slide in value over the past few years was primarily caused by a large gap between interest rates in Japan and the United States. While U.S. rates surged, Japanese rates remained below or near zero, prompting investors to seek higher returns outside Japan.
That dynamic began to reverse last Wednesday, when the Bank of Japan unexpectedly raised its key interest rate for only the second time in nearly two decades. This move, coupled with indications from the U.S. Federal Reserve of imminent rate cuts, led to a swift appreciation of the yen.
As of Friday morning, the yen, which had been trading around 161 to the dollar just weeks earlier, had crossed below 150.
The breach of the 150-yen-to-dollar threshold, which traders viewed as a tipping point, exacerbated panic among investors who feared that companies would have to lower their profit forecasts.
The Topix index, which represents a broad spectrum of the Japanese economy, dropped 6.1 percent on Friday -- capping off its worst two-day performance since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
After the sell-off, the start of trading in Tokyo on Monday was seen as a test of whether confidence in Japanese companies would persist even without the yen's support. Historically, Japanese investors have seized opportunities during foreign-led market meltdowns, and prices were low.
The problem was that this time, the buyers hung back. Japan's trading day was marked by a frenzy of selling: The Nikkei 225 index, another benchmark index, posted its largest one-day point drop ever. Some called it "Black Monday," recalling the global stock market crash in October 1987.
"After all of these reforms and stability and the Tokyo Stock Exchange pushing for better capital returns, you still saw no bid from the Japanese investor," said Jesper Koll, a director at Monex Group, a financial services firm. "It got spooky," he said.
On Tuesday, Japanese shares began to recover. The Nikkei 225 index rebounded by 10.2 percent, and some traders speculated that the market might have reached a settling point after factoring in a stronger yen.
One 43-year-old Japanese investor who asked not to be named, a former operator of a cram school in the Tokyo area, said that despite feeling "scared and wanting to escape," he bought stocks on Monday. When prices rebounded he pocketed the equivalent of around $ 2,700 and went off to take his children to a play center.
The question -- which no one, of course, can answer -- is whether the weak-yen, high-stock-price bubble has fully deflated.
On Wednesday, Japanese indexes continued to recover, though movements were relatively small. The Nikkei 225 closed up 1.2 percent, while the Topix gained 2.3 percent. Japanese indexes had broadly returned to where they were at the start of the year.
Nomura Research Institute, in a note on Wednesday, suggested that the weaker yen started pushing stock prices higher at the start of 2023, when the Nikkei was hovering around 26,000. That could mean that stocks might fall by another third from where they are now if all of the yen-related rally reverses. For many companies and their investors, that would be a painful adjustment.
Joy Yang, who leads Asian economic research at Point72, a hedge fund, said she was waiting to make judgments on Japan's economy and stocks until markets had calmed and several key indicators were released. For example, economic output figures due next week will show whether newfound inflation in Japan is helping to stir growth, she said.
"For now," Ms. Yang said, "we are waiting for the markets to settle, and we'll see how to go forward from there."

After a Million Miles Combined, Two Taxis Finally Retire: [briefing]

Full text: The Ford Crown Victoria, once a ubiquitous sight on the streets of New York, is being pushed out for newer, wheelchair-accessible models.
Good morning. It's Thursday. Today we'll catch up with two drivers who had the oldest cabs on the streets of New York City. We'll also get details on why the man charged with stabbing the author Salman Rushdie in 2022 is now facing terrorism-related charges.
Ravinder Sharma is happy behind the wheel of his new cab. Haroon Abdullah is not.
Sharma and Abdullah were the taxi drivers with the oldest cabs on the streets of New York City at the end of 2023. Sharma had driven his 2011 Ford Crown Victoria more than 550,000 miles, enough for 94 round trips between Times Square and San Francisco. Abdullah had logged 491,000 miles on his cab, also a Crown Victoria.
The city agency that regulates taxis said that neither car should have still been carrying passengers. The two Crown Victorias were well past the agency's seven-year age limit.
Sharma and Abdullah are now driving Toyota RAV4s, compact crossover sport utility vehicles, not full-size sedans like the Crown Victoria -- which they miss. "The Crown Victoria was good for the customer. Big room in the back," Sharma said.
But he acknowledged that the RAV4 "handles better," given "the way the roads are in New York City. Very bad roads."
Sharma also said that the RAV4's financial performance was better than the Crown Victoria's. He said he was spending $ 18 to $ 20 a day on gasoline now, compared with about $ 60 a day when he was driving the older car.
Sharma's RAV4 was "nearly new" when he bought it in May, he said. But the vehicle was classified as a used car because another driver had driven it for a few months. He said he was looking forward to driving the RAV4 for seven years, until it ages out.
Abdullah, who said he was leasing his RAV4, keeps his Crown Victoria parked at home, that car's meter blocked electronically by the taxi agency. He has pleaded with the agency to unblock the meter, so that he could drive the Crown Victoria as a cab again -- at least "until next April," so that he could make enough money to afford a taxi that accommodates wheelchairs.
Accessibility is an issue for the RAV4, and for the taxi agency.
The city settled a class-action lawsuit about accessibility in 2013 by promising that 50 percent of the taxis in the city would be able to accommodate wheelchair users by 2020. But the deadline came and went, and a three-year extension ran out last fall with the city still short of the 50 percent threshold. In February, when advocates for people with disabilities filed a new lawsuit saying that the taxi commission had "no intention of even attempting" to meet the goal, 42 percent of the taxis on the streets could accept wheelchair users.
In May, a judge directed the agency to submit a plan to reach the 50 percent level. A spokesman for the agency said it had complied.
But until last week, a loophole in taxi regulations had allowed a driver who owned a medallion -- the permit required to drive a cab in New York -- to take possession of a car with a different medallion and install his or her medallion. The original owner would retain the medallion that was taken off. Drivers like Sharma, whose cabs had aged out, could find used cabs that were still new enough to be driven. In taxi parlance, this was known as "rehacking." Some drivers have used that provision to sidestep the agency's wheelchair-accessibility rules, because accessible taxis are more expensive.
With the two Crown Victorias off the streets, the taxi commission says that the oldest cab now in operation is a 2013 Toyota Prius. An administrative hearing about why that car is still carrying passengers is scheduled for Aug. 12. The owner of the medallion on the Prius, Khaled Elboghdedy, said he had been looking at new cars.
Unlike Sharma, Abdullah said he was "not financially OK" with the RAV4. He said that he was earning as much in fares as when he was driving the Crown Victoria, but that he was taking home $ 4,500 a month less because he also has to pay the lease on the Toyota.
"I can't buy a car on this," he said.
Prepare for a chance of showers and thunderstorms, with temperatures in the mid-80s. At night, the clouds will clear, with temperatures dropping to the high 60s.
In effect until Aug. 13 (Tisha B'Av).

Where 3 a.m. is prime time: The Fulton Fish Market, which supplies the city with nearly half its seafood, opens when most of New York is dark and quiet.
Rushdie stabbing suspect is accused of supporting terrorism
A new indictment accuses Hadi Matar, who was charged with stabbing the author Salman Rushdie in August 2022, of providing "material support and resources" to Hezbollah, the politically powerful Lebanese group that has backing from Iran.
The indictment charges Matar, 26, with offering "personnel, specifically himself, and services" to terrorists from September 2020 to the day of the stabbing at the Chautauqua Institution in western New York. Rushdie, who had spent years in hiding after the Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989, was scheduled to give a talk about how the United States was a safe place for exiled writers.
Matar ran onto the stage, prosecutors said, and stabbed Rushdie about 10 times before people from the audience pulled him away. Rushdie, who was blinded in one eye by the stabbing, wrote about the attack in a memoir, "Knife," which was published earlier this year.
Matar has been on trial in Chautauqua County Court on charges of attempted murder and assault. Last month he turned down a deal that called for him to plead guilty to the attempted murder charge. Doing so would have cut his time in state prison to 20 years. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years if he is found guilty at trial.
The plea deal also called for him to plead guilty to essentially the same charges that are in the new indictment, which was unsealed in Federal District Court in Buffalo. Those charges carry a separate maximum sentence of 20 years.
Matar's lawyer, Nathaniel Baron II, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Matar, who moved to the United States from Lebanon when he was a child, had become increasingly isolated and focused on Islam in the years before the attack.

The Corvette's Revival Doesn't Ensure Success For Electric Versions: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sales of sports cars have been steadily declining for about three decades, but there has been one exception to that trend. The Chevrolet Corvette has recently stormed back to near-record popularity.
Like the company that makes it, General Motors, the Corvette must now slalom around a trickier obstacle: transitioning to an electrified lineup, even as most sports-car buyers insist they have no interest in switching from gas pumps to plugs.
G.M. sold 53,785 of the eighth-generation Corvettes, or C8s, worldwide last year, just 22 shy of its top sales year in 1979. Americans bought about 34,000 of those, including Stingray coupes that start from $ 66,000, nearly twice as many Corvettes as they bought in 2019.
The car's revival has been driven by a change that may not seem a big deal to the average commuter. After seven decades as a classic front-engine two-seater, Chevrolet moved its V-8 behind the passengers, a midengine design typically associated with supercars from Ferrari or Lamborghini. Engineers at G.M. chose the $ 250,000 Ferrari 458 Italia as a target in performance and technology.
Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision, a marketing research company, said the Corvette's more exotic recent design, relatively affordable prices and unapologetic attitude had driven its success.
"They delivered an authentic sports car, and that authenticity is such an important part of the purchase decision," Mr. Edwards said.
The Corvette's recent sales gains have bucked a broad trend of American drivers moving away from cars, especially sports cars and coupes, and toward sport-utility vehicles. Two-door cars like the Audi TT and the Mercedes SLK have disappeared. Toyota's reborn Supra sold fewer than 2,700 cars last year, less than one-tenth of Corvette's sales. Sales of what the industry calls "enthusiast cars" have fallen by half since 2000, to 223,000 last year, according to Motor Intelligence.
Even relatively affordable sports cars have struggled. The Ford Mustang, which racked up sales of 120,000 in 2015, managed fewer than 59,000 last year. G.M. has retired the Chevrolet Camaro and Stellantis has done away with the Dodge Challenger. Daniel Pund, editor in chief of Road & Track magazine, said many consumers drawn to fast, fashionable cars had shifted to luxury sport-utility vehicles or electric vehicles. Some potential buyers "are scared to drive a small, low car when everything else is a tall S.U.V.," Mr. Pund said.
Corvette appears to have avoided that fate in large part because of its decision to move the engine.
Tadge Juechter, who is retiring as the fifth Corvette chief engineer since the car's 1953 unveiling, said the median age of its buyer had been rising by roughly one year each year, topping out around 64. He knew that was unsustainable.
"It was a comfortable car for our traditional customers, but you're not going to sell a significant number to 100-year-olds," Mr. Juechter said.
A midengine Corvette, which some G.M. engineers and executives had considered since the 1960s, was meant to shake things up, including a design that could support future hybrid and electric versions. But some people at G.M. got cold feet. Mr. Juechter recalled "a strong push" to offer both the existing C7 and redesigned Corvette C8s in showrooms to keep its Bowling Green, Ky., factory humming and avoid alienating loyalists.
Executives eventually realized that when G.M. offered the C8, "we won't sell any of those old ones," Mr. Juechter said. "The midengine car was highly controversial, but in hindsight it looks brilliant," he added.
Brad Franz, Chevrolet's director of car and crossover marketing, said the C8 continued to attract boomers, while pulling a demographic coup: Its median buyer age has fallen to 55 from 64 over the last six years.
Mr. Pund recently met fanatical 'Vette owners during a driving tour from Bowling Green, where a Corvette museum sits near the factory, to North Carolina. He said G.M. had underestimated its customers' willingness to evolve with the car.
"Those owners don't think of the C8 as something radical," Mr. Pund said. "They just think of it as a new Corvette."
G.M. hopes to build on that momentum with an expanded lineup that now includes the 2024 Corvette E-Ray, the first hybrid version of the model and one of the first among mass-produced sports cars; Porsche will follow by year's end with a hybrid version of its 911 model.
Mr. Franz said G.M.'s early sales data suggested that the hybrid Corvette was attracting more college-educated, higher-income buyers.
I recently test drove the E-Ray in the Berkshires. Moving the engine -- a 495-horsepower V-8 -- behind the seats improves acceleration and handling, by keeping more weight in the car's center. It also clears room below the hood for an electric motor that sends 160 horsepower to front wheels, for a total 655 horsepower and an unfair fight against strictly gasoline-powered cars.
The result is the fastest-accelerating Corvette yet with a zero to 60 miles-per-hour time of 2.5 seconds. Its electric helping hand allows the E-Ray to run its engine in four-cylinder mode more often, bringing highway fuel efficiency to a federally rated 24 miles per gallon, versus 25 for a standard Stingray with 160 fewer horsepower.
A tiny hybrid battery slots into the center tunnel between the driver and passenger. And while the E-Ray requires no plug, the car's battery never runs dry because the car can fully recharge it in two to three miles of normal driving simply by recapturing braking energy.
Mr. Edwards said luring buyers to electrified Corvettes, or any two-seater, is not about a green pitch. "You talk about added performance, innovation or value," he said. "You don't call it an environmentally friendly sports car."
A fully electric Corvette might be next. G.M.'s president, Mark Reuss, said on LinkedIn in 2022 that the company would offer an electric Corvette "in the future," but the company has declined to provide any details.
Sports cars appear to be the final frontier for electrification. Most car enthusiasts became wedded to the signature sounds and driving character of favorite brands or models of internal-combustion engine cars from an early age, Mr. Juechter said. Many are deeply skeptical that electric versions can reproduce or replace them, despite any advantage in straight-line acceleration. A key objection is batteries that add too much weight, dulling the handling of what are supposed to be featherweight and agile cars. Finding enough space in these compact cars for batteries large enough to deliver satisfactory range is another challenge.
No automaker is mass-producing an electric two-seat sports car for the United States or Europe, although Porsche intends to replace its slow-selling gasoline-powered Boxster and Cayman models with electric versions next year. Ferrari says it will come out with its first electric car in 2026.
A survey of American car owners by Strategic Vision this year found that 56 percent were "absolutely not interested" in an electric vehicle, up from 51 percent in 2023. That rises to 60 percent for Corvette owners. Mr. Edwards said Chevrolet appears wise to keep offering gas, hybrid and, eventually, electric Corvettes.
"If you say pure E.V., a lot of Corvette people are going to walk away," he said. G.M. will "have an easier road if they have a balanced portfolio."
Mr. Edwards added that while G.M.'s electric cars were often impressive, the company had often fumbled their introductions. And G.M. hasn't done enough to persuade many of its customers to consider the new technology.
"They need to create that bridge from where they are, to where customers are going to be," he said. "Historically, G.M. has not done a good job of understanding how to talk to future and current customers without ticking everyone off."
G.M. executives said the E-Ray was expressly designed to be the most customer-friendly Corvette. Electricity is the secret sauce that allows all-wheel-drive, track-level performance and efficiency.
"Long before we announced the E-Ray, we had customers hollering at us, 'You'd better not make an electric Corvette!"' Mr. Juechter said. "But the E-Ray is a perfect mechanism to not be afraid of electricity, to show it can do great stuff for you."
Mr. Juechter said the Corvette, with its cultural familiarity and all-American image, could be an ambassador for electrification. That may be especially helpful in the Midwest and South, where the Corvette has a devoted following and electric vehicles are not as popular as they are on the coasts.
"The E-Ray is a great look at what the Corvette could become," he said.

Japanese Stocks Tumble as Yen Strengthens, Ending Long Surge: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A rapidly strengthening yen and a sell-off in stocks in the United States pushed Japan's markets to a second consecutive day of big losses on Friday.
A more-than-yearlong rally in Japanese stocks, driven by the country's depreciated currency, hit a wall at the end of the week.
Japan's Topix index, which includes companies that represent a broad swath of the Japanese economy, fell 6.1 percent on Friday, extending losses from the previous day. It was the index's worst two-day performance since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The Nikkei 225 index fell 5.8 percent on Friday.
Analysts noted a "state of panic" in Japanese markets after the Bank of Japan's decision on Wednesday to raise interest rates for only the second time since 2007. Sentiment worsened on Friday over concerns about the health of the economy and the tech industry in the United States.
The central bank had raised its key rate to a quarter point, up from a range of zero to 0.1 percent. The move bolstered Japan's currency, the yen, which was trading at approximately 149 to the dollar on Friday, a significant recovery from 154 at the start of the week.
A weaker yen had been good for Japan's major exporters, inflating their earnings and making Japanese products more competitive globally. Policies including rock-bottom interest rates that kept the yen weak were long a cornerstone of Japanese economic policy.
This dynamic of a weaker yen and rising corporate profits reached a peak in recent years as the yen fell to near four-decade lows against the dollar. Companies like Toyota reported some of the largest profits in Japanese history, attracting investors and sending Japanese indexes to a series of record highs.
Now some economists suggest the trend is reversing.
"It can be understood that the bubble of a weak yen and high stock prices created by the Bank of Japan has entered the process of collapsing," Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, wrote in a note on Friday.
Japanese markets are also grappling with concerns over a potential slowdown in growth in the United States. The S&P 500 index fell 1.4 percent on Thursday. Tech shares also plunged after an announcement from Intel that it would cut 15 percent of its work force.
The U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates, which are at a more-than-two-decade high, unchanged at a meeting on Wednesday, but analysts expect it to begin lowering rates later this year.
The double punch of a more expensive yen and tech-sector concerns slammed Japanese exporters involved in the semiconductor supply chain. Shares of Tokyo Electron, Japan's biggest maker of semiconductor equipment, fell 12 percent on Friday.
For Japan, a long-term appreciation of the yen is expected to be largely positive, helping to cool the import-driven inflation squeezing consumers. But analysts view the sudden strengthening of the currency as a blow because of its potential effect on corporate profits.
Japan's finance ministry said it was closely monitoring the yen's developments.
"Sudden fluctuations could increase uncertainty in business activities and have a negative impact on people's lives," Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said in a news conference on Friday.

Toyota's Profit Increases By 1.7%, Aided by the Yen
Toyota reported Thursday that its April-June profit rose 1.7 percent, boosted by a favorable exchange rate, as vehicle sales grew around the world despite a certification scandal that halted production in Japan for several months.
Fiscal first quarter profit at Toyota rose to 1.33 trillion yen ( $ 8.9 billion), a record profit for that period, from 1.31 trillion yen the same period a year ago.
Quarterly sales edged up 12 percent to 11.8 trillion yen.
A weak yen, which boosts the value of overseas profits for Japanese exporters, also helped. The U.S. dollar has been trading at above 160 yen in recent weeks, although it slid below 150 yen after the Bank of Japan raised a key interest rate.
The currency fluctuations added 370 billion yen in operating profit for the period, according to Toyota Motor Corp.
Cost reduction efforts added 55 billion yen in operating profit. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Shares of Shake Shack Rise on Good Sales News
Shake Shack's shares jumped 16 percent in afternoon trading on Thursday after the chain topped market expectations for second-quarter same-store sales, as demand for its burgers and chicken sandwiches stayed robust even as competition intensifies for value meals in the United States.
The company also expects to achieve positive free cash flow for 2024, which would be a first since 2017.
Shake Shack, under its new chief, Rob Lynch, has invested in improving in-store experience for customers with efforts to reduce checkout time at its kiosks to help sales.
The company said it had reduced average wait times in the second quarter on a sequential basis, and improved order accuracy year over year.
Digital promotions and a special summer menu also helped as Shack went up against stiff competition from peers. REUTERS

Tesla Vision Of Robotaxis Raises Doubt: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Tesla says self-driving taxis will power its growth, but the company hasn't said when such a service would be ready or how much it would increase profits.
As sales of its electric cars have fallen, Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have sought to convince Wall Street that the company's future lies not in the grinding business of making and selling cars but in the far more exciting world of artificial intelligence.
In Mr. Musk's telling, one of Tesla's main A.I.-based businesses will be driverless taxis, or robotaxis, that can operate pretty much anywhere and in any condition. Tesla is very close to perfecting such vehicles and will easily secure regulatory approval to put them on roads, Mr. Musk said last week on a conference call to discuss the company's second-quarter results.
Mr. Musk's vision of autonomous vehicles, or A.V.s, is not limited to cars that drive themselves. He has also claimed that individuals who buy Teslas will be able to make money when they are asleep or at work by letting the company use their cars as robotaxis.
The robotaxi service will, Mr. Musk has said, catapult Tesla's stock market valuation, around $ 740 billion now, into the trillions of dollars.
But first, a lot will have to go right.
His idea would require major advances in technology and fundamental changes in the way people viewed cars. The experience of driverless taxi services like Waymo and Cruise in Phoenix, San Francisco and other cities raises questions about when such offerings will become profitable and how much money they will make.
Tesla's technology will face stiff competition from Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, the parent company of Google; ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft; and Amazon's self-driving business, Zoox. Carmakers including General Motors, which owns Cruise, are also pursuing autonomous driving, along with Chinese tech and auto companies like Baidu and BYD.
"It's a supercompetitive business that's barely profitable," said Ross Gerber, chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, which owns Tesla and Uber stock.
Tesla, which did not respond to a request for comment, became the world's most valuable car company because investors believed Mr. Musk could achieve his goal of selling 20 million cars a year, compared with around 1.8 million last year. Toyota, the world's largest automaker, sold more than 11 million cars in 2023. In the last six months, however, Tesla's car sales have fallen.
Mr. Musk has recently said that the focus on the company's sagging car business is misplaced and that investors should buy and hold Tesla stock because of its work on ambitious projects like the robotaxis and a humanoid robot called Optimus.
Some Wall Street analysts and many of Mr. Musk's ardent fans see the pivot as evidence of his genius. But skepticism of the company's plans has been growing, especially after the company last week reported a 45 percent drop in second-quarter profit and delayed the unveiling of its robotaxi design to October, from August.
Tesla's stock price is down about 6 percent since the earnings report.
Mr. Gerber suggested that Mr. Musk was trying to divert attention from the company's core business. "It's a convenient reorientation when you're having a hard time selling cars," Mr. Gerber said.
Still, some analysts believe that robotaxis and self-driving software could generate significant profits for Tesla.
The entire robotaxi market may someday be worth $ 5 trillion, Tom Narayan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said. And though he added that "regulators aren't going to allow one company to have a monopoly," RBC estimated that the economic potential of Tesla's robotaxis already accounted for over $ 400 billion of its stock value.
Tesla offers two types of driver-assistance software for the cars it sells now. One is called Autopilot, and the other, a more advanced option, is marketed as Full Self-Driving and costs $ 99 per month. Some analysts say those systems could also be a huge source of profits.
The company has been working on autonomous driving for years, and Mr. Musk has repeatedly said it was just months away from creating a system that can operate cars flawlessly without human assistance. But Tesla's two driver-assistance systems, which can accelerate, steer and brake on their own, require drivers to be prepared to retake control at any moment. Some users report that they have to intervene often.
Accidents attributed to the software have prompted numerous lawsuits and an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agency has said the technology does not adequately ensure that drivers remain attentive. In April, it issued a report linking hundreds of accidents and at least 29 fatal crashes to use of Tesla's driver-assistance systems.
Experts who have studied autonomous driving systems have said Mr. Musk has chosen a more difficult approach to self-driving cars than other companies. For instance, Tesla uses relatively affordable cameras to detect objects and people rather than investing in more costly ones or lidar sensors, which use laser pulses and which some experts say are more capable.
Tesla is also trying to build robotaxis that would operate in any environment, including places for which the company has not created detailed maps. By contrast, Waymo vehicles operate in places that the company has thoroughly mapped.
"You're trying to solve the hardest problems," said Philip Koopman, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, a leading center of autonomous vehicle research. "I'd be surprised if Tesla could pull off a 'no kidding' robotaxi in the next 10 years without sensors and maps."
Other robotaxi services offer a cautionary tale. Last year G.M. halted its Cruise driverless taxi service after one of its cars hit a pedestrian and dragged her for 20 feet in San Francisco. Cruise recently resumed road testing of its cars in three cities.
Waymo, which currently provides rides to paying customers in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix, has had many years to improve its technology, which uses lidar.
Other companies that are building self-driving vehicle businesses "lack Waymo's unique recipe, honed over 15 years and millions of engineering hours and billions of miles of on-road and simulation driving," said John Krafcik, a former chief executive of Waymo and a board member of the electric vehicle company Rivian.
Yet some analysts said they still did not know how Alphabet would make money from Waymo. Will it manage a large fleet of self-driving cars over the long term or try to sell or license Waymo's technology to ride-hailing companies like Uber?
"We don't know what the business model is," said Mark Mahaney, who heads Evercore ISI's internet research team.
And investors don't know when Waymo will generate profits for Alphabet. The company records Waymo's revenue and operating profits in a category it refers to as Other Bets, a collection of experimental businesses. Other Bets recorded an operating loss of about $ 2 billion in the first half of this year, but Alphabet did not disclose how much of that stemmed from Waymo. Mr. Mahaney said he assumed that Waymo had accounted for a significant chunk of that loss.
A representative for Waymo declined to answer questions about its plans, strategy and financial performance. Alphabet did not respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Krafcik, who left Waymo in 2022, said he expected the business to be profitable this year in markets like San Francisco, after accounting for the cost of vehicles, maintenance, energy, hardware, insurance and personnel. His definition of profits did not include research and development and some other overhead costs.
In a vote of confidence in Waymo, Alphabet said last week that it would invest another $ 5 billion in the business.
Another challenge for Tesla will be its plans for persuading car owners to put their vehicles in its robotaxi service -- an approach that Mr. Musk recently described as "Airbnb on wheels."
Services like Turo and Getaround allow people to rent out their personal vehicles. But it's unclear how many people would lend their cars to strangers. If the number is too large, the profits are likely to be small.
"Say everyone who owns a Tesla can rent it out," said Christopher Robinson, a senior director at Lux Research who has studied robotaxis. "You're going to flood the market, and prices are going to come down."
Mr. Robinson noted that robotaxis, while eliminating drivers, would require plenty of human labor. Cars will need to be cleaned, maintained and repaired. A driverless taxi service would have to employ customer service agents, engineers who remotely monitored cars and technicians who fixed and retrieved vehicles that had problems.
"It's a slightly better taxi," Mr. Robinson said. "I don't think it's as disruptive as people think it is."

Japan's Grip On Car Trade In Thailand Is Loosening: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After dominating sales in Thailand for decades, Mazda, Nissan and other Japanese companies are losing their grip on a market long viewed as a regional hub.
Japanese companies established Thailand's auto industry virtually from scratch, dating back to the years after World War II. By the late 1970s, Japanese brands commanded around 90 percent of car sales in Thailand. They invested in building Thai supply chains, and their cars were also widely perceived by customers as reliable.
In the 1990s, American and South Korean automakers targeted the Thai market but barely made a dent in Japan's share.
Now Japanese automakers' stronghold is finally being loosened by Chinese manufacturers that offer something they don't: electric vehicles at affordable prices. The influx of Chinese brands like BYD, Great Wall Motor and SAIC Motor in the past two years is ringing alarms in Japan.
In December, Srettha Thavisin, Thailand's prime minister, traveled to Japan with a message for Japanese companies: Move quickly, invest in electric vehicles or lose out to China.
"You are not alone in the world," Mr. Thavisin warned Japan's automakers in an interview with Japanese media.
Japanese companies' unwillingness to fully embrace electric vehicles, which are popular in Thailand, has held them back in the Thai market. Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Suzuki and Isuzu have taken the heaviest blows, in part because of their limited lineups of plug-in hybrid or fully electric models. Last year, new car sales in Thailand for those companies collectively dropped 25 percent while overall sales fell 9 percent, according to data compiled by MarkLines, an automotive information provider.
This month, Honda announced it would cease vehicle production at one of its two factories in Thailand next year. And Suzuki said in June that it would close its only vehicle-manufacturing plant in the country.
Japanese manufacturers, which account for about 75 percent of vehicle sales in Thailand, are taking steps to stem the erosion of their position. During Mr. Thavisin's trip to Japan, Toyota, Honda, Isuzu and Mitsubishi said they would invest $ 4.3 billion over five years to convert their Thai factories to make electric vehicles. Late last year, Honda began producing electric vehicles in Thailand.
Nissan established Thailand's first Japanese auto assembly plant in Bangkok in 1962, a time when Thais bought only a few thousand vehicles a year. Toyota followed shortly after, starting vehicle production in Thailand in 1964.
From early on, the Japanese companies viewed Thailand as a regional export hub for Southeast Asia. They spent decades investing to develop Thai supply chains and sales networks, predominantly for pickup trucks that are exported and sold domestically. Japan's strategy paid off in the 1980s and 1990s in particular, when Japanese automakers cashed in on booming demand in Southeast Asia while the United States and Germany were largely focused on Eastern Europe.
Southeast Asia, including Thailand, stands as the largest market for Mitsubishi and other smaller Japanese automakers. In the fiscal year that ended in March, Mitsubishi's sales in the region fell 9 percent from the previous year.
Mitsubishi and other Japanese automakers are pinning hopes on developing new hybrid and electric models to regain lost ground. In February, Mitsubishi introduced a hybrid version of its Xpander multipurpose vehicle in Thailand, and the company said orders had surpassed expectations.
But the Chinese electric vehicle companies are formidable competition.
GAC Aion, the E.V. arm of the state-owned Guangzhou Automobile Group, has quickly established a manufacturing and sales business in Thailand and is trying to break into another Japanese stronghold: taxis. Toyota accounts for a vast majority of taxis on the road in Thailand.
Through a Thai partner, Gold Integrate, Aion has released a fully electric sedan dedicated solely for the country's ride-hailing and taxi market.
Over the past year, the Aion-Gold Integrate partnership has sold several thousand of a taxi-only model to commercial customers in Thailand for about $ 25,000 with a nine-year warranty.
Huang Yongjie, chairman of Gold Integrate, which also invested in 15 showrooms for Aion, said Toyota had responded to Aion's entry into the Thai market by cutting the price of its main taxi model by nearly $ 3,000. It was notable, Mr. Huang said, because "Toyota never cuts prices."

Full text: Japan's economy is faltering after a rise in prices led consumers to cut back on spending.
As the rest of the world fought to keep inflation in check, one country welcomed it with open arms.
In the past few years, Japan saw a burst of inflation, spurred by pandemic supply chain snags and geopolitical shocks, as a way to shake the economy out of a decades-long cycle of weak growth and pressure from deflation. So while major central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates to rein in prices, the Bank of Japan kept rates low as inflation accelerated.
The theory was that by sticking with rock-bottom rates, the central bank could harness the temporary spike in prices to foster the kind of inflation it had long sought: moderate, steady and supporting economic growth.
Businesses could cite their rising costs to justify price increases, leading to higher revenues that went toward higher wages for workers. With more money in their pockets, consumers could spend more, creating a positive economic cycle.
There have been some promising signs: Big Japanese firms like Toyota have reported large profits and pledged the biggest wage increases for workers in decades. In March, the Bank of Japan raised its policy rate for the first time in 17 years, concluding that the economy had achieved the "virtuous cycle" between wages and prices it had envisioned.
Ahead of a Bank of Japan meeting this week, there are a growing number of signs that everything is not going to plan.
The central bank's commitment in recent years to keeping rates low has not only allowed inflation to run hotter. (It has been above policymakers' 2 percent target for more than two years.) It has also prompted the yen to plunge, making imported food, fuel and other staples suddenly more expensive. Consumers have responded by cutting back sharply on spending.
Smaller businesses facing sluggish demand have found it hard to raise prices and salaries as the country's policymakers had hoped. And it remains unclear whether the wage increases at big multinational companies are spilling over to Japan's more domestically focused firms.
Some economists suggest that the weak consumption dragging on Japan's economy is a response to the Bank of Japan's low-rate stance, which has raised fears in consumers that inflation will continue to surpass wage increases for years to come. Analysts are roughly evenly split on whether Bank of Japan officials will raise rates or keep them steady on Wednesday, when they are set to announce their decision.
"The B.O.J. hoped that temporary inflation could lead to long-lasting inflation by pushing up wages -- giving inflation second legs. But I don't see that's the case," said Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute and a former policy board member at Japan's central bank.
He said "surprisingly weak" consumer spending and the falling yen "all have one root: mistakes of monetary policy made in Japan over several years."
If the Bank of Japan had raised rates years earlier, Mr. Kiuchi said, "the yen would not have depreciated so much, consumer activity would have been more stable and the economy would likely be doing better."
Recently, on a sweltering afternoon in northwestern Tokyo, Yumiko Umemura, a 49-year-old mother of two, stopped by a meat shop to buy a mix of ground beef and pork. Ms. Umemura said her grocery bills had gone up in recent years while her salary at a data-processing firm had remained the same -- a squeeze on her family's budget she expects to last for some time.
That has left her looking for ways to save, like buying 250 grams of meat instead of 300. "Shopping without excess, that's how I've been cutting back," she said.
Yoshimasa Yamamoto, the owner of the shop, said he was grappling with the combination of slowing sales and rising costs. Even locally sourced meat costs more, he said, because the feed for livestock is mostly imported.
Mr. Yamamoto said he would like to raise prices but feels he can't because for decades his customers have known only stagnant prices.
"Customers are used to our prices, and if we raise them, they won't buy," he said. "People have already stopped buying as much anyway -- how could we raise prices?"
These dynamics are starting to appear in Japan's broader economy. Salaries, while ticking up, have failed to keep pace with prices, leading inflation-adjusted wages to fall for 26 consecutive months, through May. Consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, has fallen for four quarters in a row.
Japan's economy has shrunk in two of the past three quarters, losing its spot as the world's third largest to Germany's. This month, Japan's Cabinet Office cut its forecast for economic growth for the fiscal year through March 2025, to 0.9 percent from 1.3 percent, mostly because of a downgrade to consumer spending.
"Consumer demand is weak. The savings rate has fallen to zero. People are having to spend their income," said Richard Katz, an economist and author of a recent book, "The Contest for Japan's Economic Future." "To presume companies will be able to pass on wages -- the B.O.J. is seeing things through a prism that tells them what they want to see."
One reason Japan has struggled to manage the effects of rising prices, some economists say, is that officials have had a hard time moving on from longstanding policies intended to encourage inflation when there was none. A reluctance to raise rates because it could dampen demand, they say, has given way to an acknowledgment that consumer spending is perhaps even more sensitive to fears of persistently high inflation.
The yen has recovered some of its value in recent weeks -- partly because expectations for falling U.S. interest rates have made Japanese assets more attractive -- but it remains far weaker than it was before the pandemic.
Hopes that the virtuous cycle of steadily rising inflation, wages and spending could still be in the cards are tied to the pay increases agreed during the spring labor negotiations known as the "shunto."
The Bank of Japan's March rate increase came just days after Japan's largest federation of trade unions said negotiations between big Japanese companies and unionized employees had resulted in the biggest jump in pay in decades.
Shunto wage increases, which cover about 16 percent of the labor force, began in April and phased in through June, so economists are still monitoring their broader impact. The economic impact of last year's shunto increases, also sizable, ended up being "a big disappointment," Mr. Katz said.
"Signs point to this time being better," he added. "But by how much? We don't know yet."

Ex-Communist Leader In Vietnam Dies at 80: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Known for his "blazing furnace" anticorruption campaign, Mr. Trong consolidated power in one of the world's few remaining Communist dictatorships.
Nguyen Phu Trong, the hard-line general secretary of Vietnam's Communist Party, who presided over his country's economic and geopolitical transformation and reshaped its leadership with his "blazing furnace" anticorruption campaign, died on Friday in Hanoi. He was 80.
His death, in a hospital, was announced by the official Nhan Dan newspaper, which said that Mr. Trong had died of "old age" and an unspecified serious illness.
Speculation had swirled in January about Mr. Trong's health after he skipped meetings with several foreign leaders. The seriousness of his illness became clear on Thursday, when the party announced that he would step back from his duties to focus on his health, and that President To Lam, a former security minister, would take over his responsibilities.
For 12 years, Mr. Trong sat at the apex of power in Vietnam's Communist hierarchy. He served an unprecedented three terms as party chief and nearly three decades in the Politburo. He consolidated power in one of the world's few remaining Communist dictatorships, significantly weakening the collective form of leadership that had characterized the country's Communist Party.
His death leaves no obvious successor.
"He was the most powerful leader in Vietnam after the Vietnam War," said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS -- Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. "I think anyone who will be chosen as the next leader of Vietnam will face an uphill battle in having the same kind of authority that Nguyen Phu Trong had."
Mr. Trong represented a conservative Marxist-Leninist faction within the party, which includes another faction that is seen as more pragmatic and moderate. His death is likely to raise hopes in the West that a less doctrinaire leader could emerge. Mr. Trong, the only one in the 18-member Politburo who grew up during the Vietnam War, was a generation older than many of his peers.
A conservative ideologue who viewed corruption as a threat to the party's survival, he began a wide-reaching anticorruption campaign in 2011 that has accelerated in recent years, investigating thousands of people and prompting the dismissal of several top ministers. The results have been mixed: The campaign created a fairer business environment but has also instilled fear in many officials and paralyzed decision-making.
Mr. Trong led the harshest crackdown on dissent in decades. Under his rule, the space for civil society -- never abundant in a nation of roughly 100 million people -- shrunk further.
Vietnam has the second-highest number of political prisoners in Southeast Asia, with more than 160 people currently detained for exercising their basic rights, according to Human Rights Watch.
At home, Mr. Trong was viewed as a frugal leader who, unusual in Vietnam, did not abuse his power to enrich himself or his family. His official vehicle was a two-decade-old Toyota Crown, according to a 2022 article in Vietnamnet, an online newspaper in Vietnam affiliated with the Ministry of Information and Communications. He refused to have new suits made.
Mr. Trong oversaw one of Asia's fastest-growing economies and raised Vietnam's prestige on the international stage. Under his term, the world's major superpowers courted the country aggressively.
Mr. Trong was adept at balancing relations with the United States and China, a strategy he termed "bamboo diplomacy" ("Strong roots, stout trunk and flexible branches"). He cultivated close ties with Xi Jinping, China's top leader, who visited Vietnam in December for the third time. Three months before that, President Biden had been in Vietnam cementing a new strategic relationship with Mr. Trong.
"He was a master of hedging," said Alexander Vuving, a professor and Vietnam specialist at the Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu.
Mr. Trong was born in Hanoi into a farming family on April 4, 1944.
In 1981, after joining Vietnam's Communist Party, he traveled to the Soviet Union, where he earned a postgraduate history degree in 1983. From 1991 to 1996, he was editor in chief of the Communist Review, the mouthpiece of Vietnam's Communist Party.
Mr. Trong was never seen as a strong candidate for party chief because he lacked extensive experience in government and economics. From January 2000 to June 2006, he was secretary of the party's Executive Committee of Hanoi, the provincial capital. From 2006 to 2011, he was chairman of Vietnam's National Assembly.
Vietnam's principle of leadership is a collective one, and unlike China it has long resisted having a supreme figure at the top. Mr. Trong's low-key manner made him a suitable compromise candidate for differing factions in the country's Communist Party, and at 68 he was not expected to have a long term. He was elected general secretary in 2011.
Mr. Trong's first term was notable for a sharp rise in anti-China sentiment, after China moved an oil rig into contested waters near Vietnam's coast in 2014. That led to protests in Vietnam and sent relations between the two nations to their lowest level in three decades.
Mr. Vuving, of the Inouye center, said the oil rig incident had shifted Mr. Trong's view of the West. Few countries spoke up publicly for Vietnam at the time, except for Japan and the United States.
In 2015, Mr. Trong became the first Vietnamese Communist Party chief to travel to the United States. He met with President Barack Obama and invited him to come to Vietnam. During his visit, Mr. Trong was asked about Vietnam's human rights situation.
"Vietnamese people have never lived in a democratic atmosphere like today," he responded, but added that "it is also important to see that individual rights must be placed in the context of the common interests of the community."
"The two sides' understandings are still different," he said, "so the best way, in my opinion, is to increase dialogue. But we should not let human rights issues hinder our relations."
In 2016, Mr. Trong agreed that Vietnam would sign on to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Mr. Obama's trade initiative, which would entail Vietnam's changing its laws to legalize independent unions and allow workers to strike.
Mr. Trong was re-elected that year. In his second term, he stepped up his anticorruption campaign, punishing several senior Politburo members.
He had been in poor health for years. In 2019, absent for a long period, he skipped several state and party events. At the time, the government said only that "his health was affected by the weather and work intensity."
At the end of his term in 2021, Mr. Trong was expected to step down. But the Communist Party gave him a third term, violating its own Constitution, which limits party chiefs to two terms. He told reporters that he had not sought another term, preferring to retire because of his health, but that he had to "comply" because the Congress had elected him.
He is survived by his wife, Ngo Thi Man. The Vietnamese government does not disclose details about the children of party officials, but it is believed that he is also survived by a son and a daughter.
While Mr. Trong was happy to open up Vietnam to the West, he remained suspicious of Western democracy.
"Behind the multiparty system in reality is still the tyranny of capitalist corporations," he wrote in a 2022 book.
He added: "The reality is that the democratic institutions according to the 'liberal democracy' formula that the West tries to promote and impose on the world do not ensure that power truly belongs to the people, by the people and for the people."

'I'm Just Done': Some in Houston Weigh Leaving After Beryl: [National Desk]

Full text: Devastating, back-to-back power outages have led some in Houston to consider whether they want to stay in the city they love.
Houston is no stranger to natural disasters, but living through two crippling power outages in two months has driven some in the city to consider what may be the ultimate evacuation plan: moving out.
The more powerful of the storms, Hurricane Beryl, devastated the power infrastructure over nearly the entire city. When it hit, thousands of people were already living in shelters and hotels, according to state officials, because they had been displaced by an earlier weather event, the spring thunderstorms that caused wind damage and flooding.
Driving around Houston, it can be hard to tell which of the storms that crashed through the city had mangled the highway billboards, torn out the fences or knocked down the trees still strewn along roadsides.
Everyone knows how long it took to get their power back from the first big storm -- and when they lost it again. A second round of spoiled food. Of sweltering temperatures. Of emergency plans. In many cases, of repairs to homes that were damaged in the major May storm had yet to be finished when Beryl arrived as a Category 1 hurricane.
For some, it was too much.
"I'm just done, " said Stephanie Fuqua, 52, who moved to Houston in 2015 and plans to leave in the fall.
Ms. Fuqua's home had flooded during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. She shivered under blankets for three days when the state's electrical grid failed during the winter of 2021. Then came the most recent storms, which left her sweltering without power.
"I'm tired of the trauma," she said. When her lease is up in November, she said, she plans to move to a place where she has family, possibly Arkansas, Mississippi or South Carolina. "I love Houston. If it weren't for the hurricanes and CenterPoint, I would stay here," she said.
More than 2.2 million customers of the local utility, CenterPoint Energy, were without power at the peak of the outages last week. As of late Monday, around 135,000 were still in the dark.
Gov. Greg Abbott, who was on an economic development mission in Asia for most of last week, blamed the utility for the widespread power failures, saying on Monday that it had "dropped the ball." He threated to take action himself if the company did not provide clear plans for improvement.
The back-to-back blows left Houston, which prides itself on its resilience and optimism, unusually shaken and unsure of the future. Those who could afford them scrambled for generators, fearing what a storm even more powerful than Beryl, rated as a Category 1 when it made landfall, might do.
"Beryl was the weakest a hurricane could be. Why does it feel like Houston isn't the same?" The Houston Chronicle asked in a headline.
"I think this storm has broken people," said Lawrence Febo, 47, who works in the energy sector and was without power for six days in the hurricane after being in the dark for four days in the May storm. "It's the energy capital of the world and we cannot electrify a couple of million people?"
Then there was the matter of trees falling onto houses during the two storms.
"It came through my kitchen, took out half my house," said Michael McCormack, 32, describing the large pine tree that crashed down during the May thunderstorms.
Mr. McCormack, a remote worker in software sales, had moved to Houston a little more than a year earlier from Seattle, drawn by the "cost of living, friendly people and better weather." He was out of power for eight days -- one of around a million customers who lost power during that storm.
With his lights still out, he looked to move farther inland to Fort Worth, or even back to the Pacific Northwest. But the logistics were complicated, so he and his 3-year-old dog, Chevy, moved to another rental house in Houston, not far away.
Then Hurricane Beryl hit and he lost power again. For days.
"I had water streaming in through my attic. I'm like, not again," he said. "When my lease is up here, I have to make a judgment call."
Leslie Schover, 71, a psychologist, said she had been thinking about moving, but there was the matter of a destination. "I just think, 'Where would I go?"' she said. "There are climate-change weather dangers everywhere. And if I tried to live closer to my son in New York, it's very expensive."
Climate migration is a global phenomenon, but Houston may be particularly vulnerable. The city has long attracted transplants from other parts of the country seeking job opportunities and lower living costs.
Those who have recently arrived may have less of what is sometimes called "place attachment" -- essentially, the kind of connection people have to the area where they live -- making them perhaps more open to departing after a natural disaster, experts in disaster response said.
A 2020 study of disasters in the United States going back nearly 100 years found that "severe disasters increase out-migration rates" in the years after.
"Areas that fail to protect local quality of life in the face of extreme events will suffer a 'brain drain' as people and jobs will migrate to relatively safer areas," one of the authors of the study, Matthew Kahn, an economics professor at the University of Southern California, said in an email.
Even before the storms, Harris County, which includes Houston, had been experiencing net negative migration from other parts of the country: Since 2016, according to U.S. census data, more people have left Harris County for other counties than have moved in from elsewhere. That trend continued after 2017 when Hurricane Harvey flooded large areas of the city.
In 2023, for the first time, pollsters from the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs asked about whether city residents had considered leaving. More than half of those surveyed said yes, with about a quarter saying it was because of the weather.
"By far, Gen Z and millennials were the most concerned about weather," said Renée Cross, the researcher and senior executive director of the Hobby School. (Those who identified themselves as Republicans were more likely to say crime was their major issue, she said.)
At the same time, the population of the counties around Houston has been growing. The situation has been largely mirrored in other parts of Texas. In Dallas, for example, the county that includes the city has seen more people leaving for other states than coming in from them. But the surrounding, suburban counties are booming.
How much of that is a result of how cities manage weather emergencies is unknown. Certainly, not everyone is ready to throw in their towels.
Jim McIngvale, a furniture store owner known as Mattress Mack who is perhaps Houston's biggest and most ubiquitous booster, conceded that the image of the city had "taken a hit," but he said it could be turned around.
"You stay the course," Mr. McIngvale said, sitting in one of his furniture showrooms, an Astros hat on his head. A carved wood statue proclaiming "Houston Strong" stood nearby. "The people have a lot of fight in them," he said.
Katie Mears, who leads U.S. response work for Episcopal Relief and Development, a nonprofit, said one important aspect of climate migration was the disparity in who can afford to engage in it.
"The narrative of overcoming is appealing, but some people do leave," they said. "In these migration patterns, it's usually the rich people who go first," they said, as well as those who are younger and more highly educated.
At a cooling center and food distribution site in north Houston on Monday, no one talked about leaving town as they idled in a long line of cars waiting for water and some food to take home.
One woman, Nancy Evans, 96, said she could not imagine moving from her house in the Acres Homes neighborhood.
Perry Murry, 60, who grew up in Houston and has used a wheelchair since he was shot as a teenager, said he took refuge in his Toyota Camry during the recent outages, relying on its air-conditioning to stay cool. He did the same in the 2021 winter freeze, blasting the car's heat. He said he would never leave.
"I've got Texans on my hat, Texans on my shirt, Texans on my feet," he added, pointing to his apparel, emblazoned with the Houston Texans football logo. "This is my city."

HOUSTON — Houston is no stranger to natural disasters, but living through two crippling power outages in two months has driven some in the city to consider what may be the ultimate evacuation plan: moving out.
The more powerful of the storms, Hurricane Beryl, devastated the power infrastructure over nearly the entire city. When it hit, thousands of people were already living in shelters and hotels, according to state officials, because they had been displaced by an earlier weather event, the spring thunderstorms that caused wind damage and flooding.
Driving around Houston, it can be hard to tell which of the storms that crashed through the city had mangled the highway billboards, torn out the fences or knocked down the trees still strewn along roadsides.
Everyone knows how long it took to get their power back from the first big storm — and when they lost it again. A second round of spoiled food. Of sweltering temperatures. Of emergency plans. In many cases, of repairs to homes that were damaged in the major May storm had yet to be finished when Beryl arrived as a Category 1 hurricane.
For some, it was too much.
“I’m just done,” said Stephanie Fuqua, 52, who moved to Houston in 2015 and plans to leave in the fall.
Fuqua’s home had flooded during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. She shivered under blankets for three days when the state’s electrical grid failed during the winter of 2021. Then came the most recent storms, which left her sweltering without power.
“I’m tired of the trauma,” she said. When her lease is up in November, she said, she plans to move to a place where she has family, possibly Arkansas, Mississippi or South Carolina. “I love Houston. If it weren’t for the hurricanes and CenterPoint, I would stay here,” she said.
More than 2.2 million customers of the local utility, CenterPoint Energy, were without power at the peak of the outages last week. As of late Monday, around 135,000 were still in the dark.
Gov. Greg Abbott, who was on an economic development mission in Asia for most of last week, blamed the utility for the widespread power failures, saying on Monday that it had “dropped the ball.” He threatened to take action himself if the company did not provide clear plans for improvement.
The back-to-back blows left Houston, which prides itself on its resilience and optimism, unusually shaken and unsure of the future. Those who could afford them scrambled for generators, fearing what a storm even more powerful than Beryl, rated as a Category 1 when it made landfall, might do.
“Beryl was the weakest a hurricane could be. Why does it feel like Houston isn’t the same?” The Houston Chronicle asked in a headline.
“I think this storm has broken people,” said Lawrence Febo, 47, who works in the energy sector and was without power for six days in the hurricane after being in the dark for four days in the May storm. “It’s the energy capital of the world and we cannot electrify a couple of million people?”
Then there was the matter of trees falling onto houses during the two storms.
“It came through my kitchen, took out half my house,” said Michael McCormack, 32, describing the large pine tree that crashed down during the May thunderstorms.
McCormack, a remote worker in software sales, had moved to Houston a little more than a year earlier from Seattle, drawn by the “cost of living, friendly people and better weather.” He was out of power for eight days — one of around 1 million customers who lost power during that storm.
With his lights still out, he looked to move farther inland to Fort Worth, or even back to the Pacific Northwest. But the logistics were complicated, so he and his 3-year-old dog, Chevy, moved to another rental house in Houston, not far away.
Then Hurricane Beryl hit and he lost power again. For days.
“I had water streaming in through my attic. I’m like, not again,” he said. “When my lease is up here, I have to make a judgment call.”
Leslie Schover, 71, a psychologist, said she had been thinking about moving, but there was the matter of a destination. “I just think, ‘Where would I go?’” she said. “There are climate-change weather dangers everywhere. And if I tried to live closer to my son in New York, it’s very expensive.”
Climate migration is a global phenomenon, but Houston may be particularly vulnerable. The city has long attracted transplants from other parts of the country seeking job opportunities and lower living costs.

Strength Behind Screams: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Her performance was perhaps misunderstood at the time, just as the narrative surrounding her life would be later.
If Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" was a twist on the centuries-old Gothic horror genre, there was no one better suited to play a modern Gothic heroine than Shelley Duvall. Duvall, who died Thursday at 75, was in her late 20s when she shot the role of Wendy Torrance, put-upon wife of blocked writer Jack (Jack Nicholson). The pair have holed up with their young son in the Overlook Hotel, working as winter caretakers.
But something evil is afoot. The Overlook is less hotel than haunted house, saddled with the weight of inexplicable and violent history. Wendy is virtually trapped there, a small woman often alone in a rambling, dangerous building full of secrets. It might be more accurate to call the Overlook a monster, one that pushes its monstrousness onto its inhabitants. And it is Wendy, not Jack, who successfully resists in the end.
The Gothic heroine, the woman trapped in the menacing haunted home, must exhibit courage in the face of danger, remaining resolute while also being susceptible to the evil that lurks around every corner. Without that tension, we wouldn't be kept in suspense. In the film, Duvall is waifish, eyes wide, hair flat and scraggly, and it's hard not to believe she's going to die. Her only objective is to save her son, Danny, from his father, who -- we learn early on -- previously broke Danny's arm in an alcoholic rage. This evil she is fighting is malevolent and abusive and real, a threat she has seen in action before, only now it carries an ax.
The Wendy of Kubrick's 1980 movie is a different kind of woman than the Wendy of Stephen King's earlier novel -- she's more vulnerable, more frightened. King complained that the movie's version was "basically just there to scream and be stupid and that's not the woman that I wrote about." Duvall was cited as a weak point in many of the film's mixed reviews and nominated for a Razzie for worst actress.
Yet her work in "The Shining" has grown in critical esteem in recent years; today it can feel as if detractors simply weren't expecting how unsettling it would be to witness her performance of abject terror. There's a strangeness to it: Her eyes are both huge and heavy-lidded, her mouth equally able to draw into a rosebud or spread wide for a shriek. Throughout the film, her affect is almost that of a china doll, terrified of being shattered. She appears afraid to breathe, barely able to speak.
But plenty able to scream. Speaking with the critic Roger Ebert in 1980, Duvall revealed nuanced feelings about the shoot, likening the experience to primal scream therapy. "In my character I had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week," she explained. But "I went home very contented," she added. "It had a very calming effect. During the day I would have been absolutely miserable."
Even at her relatively young age, Duvall had made a name for herself in the movies of Robert Altman, like "McCabe and Mrs. Miller," "Nashville" and "3 Women," working in the director's loose, improv-heavy style. Kubrick, by contrast, was exacting and relentless, shooting many dozens of takes, stretching his actors to their breaking point. Duvall told David Hughes, the author of "The Complete Kubrick," that the stress of the lengthy production had pushed her into ill health. (Her boyfriend, Paul Simon, had also broken up with her just before production began.)
In 2002, Duvall retired from show business and seemed to drop out of the public eye entirely. She resurfaced in a rare 2016 television interview on an episode of "Dr. Phil" titled "A Hollywood Star's Descent Into Mental Illness: Saving The Shining's Shelley Duvall." In it, she seemed genuinely troubled, and the show generated copious backlash.
It also led to questions about the effects of lingering trauma from her experience on the set of "The Shining." (Her Razzie nomination was rescinded in 2022, with the organization noting in a statement that "we have since discovered that Duvall's performance was impacted by Stanley Kubrick's treatment of her throughout the production.") And thematically, that fit: Duvall was once again the vulnerable woman living in apparent isolation -- a small Texas hill country town that she moved to in the 1990s. Where had she gone? Why? Who knew what monsters were still stalking her?
In April 2024, however, less than two months before her death, Duvall granted an interview to The New York Times. Among the many topics of conversation was "The Shining," of which she still had fond if complicated memories. But for her, the real lurking evil wasn't Kubrick, but the broader Hollywood establishment, which she believed had dismissed and forgotten her.
"How would you feel if people were really nice, and then, suddenly, on a dime, they turn on you?" she asked. "You would never believe it unless it happens to you. That's why you get hurt, because you can't really believe it's true."
It's hardly a new tale for Hollywood heroines, who have a long history of being driven out of the industry by one monster or another. Yet though she missed her life in Hollywood, Duvall faced her future a lot like a Gothic heroine would. Interviewers in the post-"Dr. Phil" period noted that she could seem scattered but also resilient, surmounting mobility issues by driving around her small town in a white Toyota 4Runner. There was that tension between vulnerability and courage again -- the determination to keep going without forgetting the past. And if she didn't manage to fit neatly into the pre-existing narratives of others, that was just more evidence that Shelley Duvall was one strong heroine.

Plunging Yen Takes Toll On Military: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Japan is struggling to fund plans that would significantly bolster its military readiness amid rising regional threats.
The yen's collapse this year to a nearly four-decade low is undermining Japan's plans for its largest military buildup in postwar history.
The government has slashed orders for aircraft, and officials warn that further cuts may be imminent. Japan buys much of its military equipment from American companies, in transactions done in dollars. The government's purchasing power has been drastically eroded by the yen's diminishing value.
"What we are achieving in terms of actual defense capabilities and our original target -- the two are not lined up," Satoshi Morimoto, a former Japanese defense minister, said in an interview. The value of the defense budget over five years "has effectively been reduced by 30 percent," Mr. Morimoto said.
Japan's currency headache comes at a critical juncture. The country's large boost in military spending was intended to fortify defenses as Tokyo confronts mounting missile threats from North Korea and other challenges posed by China, including fears of a potential China-Taiwan conflict.
In 2022, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan announced a new national security strategy that would more than double the amount set aside for defense. The budget of 43 trillion yen over five years, equivalent to around $ 319 billion at the time, would help Japan deter attacks by giving it the ability to target bases in enemy territory.
The new budget broke with longstanding precedent on spending restraints and dependence on U.S. forces. Mr. Kishida hailed the surge in military spending as a "turning point" in Japan's history.
The problem: The budget was based on an exchange rate of 108 yen to the dollar, which even then was far from the actual rate of around 135 yen to the dollar. Now, with the yen weakening to 161 to the dollar, the cost of equipment including helicopters, submarines and tanks has skyrocketed.
Historically, a weak yen helped Japan's big exporters like Toyota Motor by making their products cheaper and more competitive overseas. But it makes imports more expensive. The government's struggle to afford military equipment is one example of how those higher costs are squeezing Japan's economy. The slide in the yen's value over the past three years has raised the price of staples like food and fuel and weighed on household spending.
Recently, the Bank of Japan, the central bank, has become more concerned about the yen's impact on import prices. Many market analysts and traders expect the bank to raise interest rates this year, possibly as soon as this month. Higher interest rates draw more investors to Japanese assets, increasing demand for the yen and propping up the currency's value.
"I am seriously concerned about this defense-budget issue, and especially the effect that the weak yen will have on dealing with North Korean and potential Chinese threats," said Maiko Takeuchi, a consulting fellow at Japan's Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry.
Several technologies central to Japan's ability to conduct counter strikes -- including U.S.-made Tomahawk missiles -- have surged in price because of the weakened yen, according to Ms. Takeuchi, who previously worked in a government agency that oversaw military purchases.
"At this point, even Japan-made military equipment is going up in price because many internal parts are sourced from overseas," Ms. Takeuchi said. "Japan is already cutting procurement of certain aircraft, and if you can't increase the budget, more cuts become inevitable," she added.
When it was first announced, Japan's five-year military budget was seen by security experts as a powerful statement: The officially pacifist country was demonstrating its resolve to the United States and other allies rattled by China's recent military buildup and other territorial threats.
As China builds closer economic and military ties with Russia, other Asia-Pacific nations have also been increasing their military budgets. For Japan, the budget drawn up two years ago would put defense spending at about 2 percent of the country's economic output in 2027, aligning with a target laid out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
"Japan's defense plan was a bold statement," said Jonathan Grady, founding principal of the advisory firm Canary Group, who has counseled the Japanese government on strategies related to funding defense spending. "The challenge now lies in honoring that commitment," he said. "Japan risks credibility right now if it can't do it."
Mr. Kishida faces limited options for funding a bigger defense budget. Japan's public debt is more than twice the size of its economic output, and tax increases have historically been both unpopular and damaging to its economy.
Funding for the defense budget was tied in 2022 to vague plans to raise taxes at "an appropriate time in or after 2024," according to cabinet office documents. That tax increase has already been punted beyond this year, and any further increases would probably be a hard sell for Mr. Kishida, who is already reckoning with record low approval ratings.
This week, Mr. Kishida is set to attend a NATO meeting in Washington marking 75 years since the alliance's founding. NATO officials have said the summit will focus on boosting allied defense and strengthening partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region.
"If you can't raise taxes and can't increase debt, you're stuck with very few options beyond pursuing deeper multilateral coordination," Mr. Grady said, referring to Japan's collaboration with the United States, Australia and other allies on initiatives like joint maritime exercises and trainings.
On Monday, Japan and the Philippines signed an agreement that would boost their ability to perform joint military exercises. That came after the United States, Japan and South Korea held three-day joint air and naval drills late last month in the East China Sea. The exercise, called "Freedom Edge," was intended to boost readiness against North Korea's missile and nuclear threats.
North Korea responded to the drills by launching two ballistic missiles last week. It vowed an "overwhelming" response to what state media described as a relationship among Japan, the United States and South Korea that was beginning to resemble "the Asia version of NATO."
Mr. Morimoto, the former defense minister, said he was considering how Japan could bear current financial constraints while keeping its military buildup intact.
Mr. Morimoto, 83, who served in Japan's self-defense force for 14 years, is a member of a panel of experts set up this year to advise on Japan's defense strategies. The group convened in February and will continue meeting through the end of the year, when it will need to decide what to recommend for next year's defense budget.
Mr. Morimoto said the lesson learned by Japan from recent currency fluctuations was that military spending could no longer be fixed to a precise number. Rather, he said, the focus needs to be on building military capabilities in terms of substance.
With regard to currency fluctuations, "no one expected such a big change in just three years, and I have no doubt there will be more unexpected things to come," Mr. Morimoto said. "But if this and that are postponed, this and that are delayed, our defense -- Japan's defense -- will not be complete."

Full text: In 2009, the botanist Naomi Fraga was hunting a flower without a name near Carson City, Nev. Ms. Fraga saw that the plant was going extinct in real time as its desert valley habitat was bulldozed to make way for Walmarts and housing developments. But in order to seek legal protections for it, she had to give it a name.
The diminutive yellow flower became the Carson Valley monkeyflower or, officially, Erythranthe carsonensis, allowing conservationists to petition the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to safeguard it under the Endangered Species Act. If their petition is approved, the flower will go from unknown to critically important in less than a generation, at least as far as Western science is concerned.
Taxonomy, the science of naming and classifying organisms, is the foundation for conserving disappearing plants and animals. Yet the field -- often viewed as an archaic, dusty tradition that harks back to intrepid 19th-century botanists describing the plants of newly colonized lands -- is dying. Several decades after the taxonomic frenzy of 1830 to 1920, when Western scientists went deep into far-flung regions of the world, molecular genetics revolutionized our ability to classify species, and began vacuuming up funding while the analog field of taxonomy was left to languish.
With genetic sequences, we can now identify the fundamental building blocks of life, but we need to be able to interpret genetic data in a way that humans can understand and use. That's taxonomy's job. And if we want to save what's left of the vast diversity of life on Earth, we'll have to reinvest in this science. How we delineate between species determines what we choose to save.
The dire state of taxonomy in the United States might be best illustrated by the Flora of North America, the definitive 30-volume attempt to name and describe every plant species here and in Canada. The project began in the 1980s, but it still hasn't been completed because its contributors have struggled to secure consistent funding. By the time the last volume is completed in 2026, it will have to be revised immediately. For instance, its first volume, on ferns, released in 1993, is utterly out of date as new species have been discovered and nonnative species have moved in. Imagine trying to understand a 2024 Camry with a manual from 1993. That's what botanists and conservationists trying to maintain biodiversity are working with.
The Flora of North America has been the victim of a broad shift in our scientific priorities as a nation. The National Science Foundation is the main funder of American botany. But since the 1980s and 1990s, its funding has increasingly gone to hypothesis-driven, laboratory-based research. When the Flora's contributors ask university botanists to work on the project, it often must be done pro bono.
Much of the work of taxonomy is done in herbariums, collections of dried plant specimens that serve as a library and are typically housed at universities and botanical gardens. In fact, many of the species left to discover are probably already hiding in herbariums as unnamed specimens. But even the herbariums are now losing funding; Duke University recently pulled support for its collection, one of the country's biggest, saying it was too costly to maintain.
I see this and other evidence of taxonomy's slow death as a tragedy. I'm in a graduate program for botany at the University of Vermont, and the act of naming a plant has always felt like a sort of interspecies intimacy. Though my university's herbarium is still well funded, it feels as if the basic work of plant identification is being left behind as grant money and students flow to flashier fields in biology. Fewer and fewer plant biology students know how to identify the plants in their own woods.
The consequences of allowing taxonomy to falter are significant. Every year, botanists around the world discover around 2,000 new plants, a number that has held fairly steady since 1995, suggesting that there are still tens of thousands of plants to introduce to science. Three-fourths of the new species are already threatened with extinction. If we don't have taxonomists to describe these species, we stand little chance of saving them -- or their habitat.
And governments and conservation groups are more likely to act when exciting species are discovered. In the mid-1990s, for example, after the botanist John Clark and colleagues discovered a number of rare species in western Ecuador, the government created an ecological reserve half the size of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. In 1992 botanists discovered and named eight plants just outside Birmingham, Ala. The area is now protected by the Nature Conservancy.
Taxonomy also could save lives and influence what we eat. There are an estimated 8.7 million species of plants and animals. We've described just 1.2 million of them. Which among those still to be named have undiscovered curative or other properties that might change the course of medicine or nutrition?
With the threats of climate change, nuclear war and artificial intelligence bearing down, the act of simply itemizing our plants can seem trivial. But when I asked Art Gilman, a botanist, a taxonomist and the author of "The New Flora of Vermont," why it matters, he paused in the careful way of a scientist. He gave no answer about curing cancer or revolutionizing food systems. "We lose the opportunity to know our world," he said, finally.

Who Is in Charge When 2 Young Drivers Hit the Road?: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Can my son learn from the example of the robot controlling the steering wheel? Or should it be the other way around?
At the corner of Iris Ave and Folsom in North Boulder, my Model 3 Tesla was self-driving when it showed up two human drivers in the lane just in front of us. All three of us were turning left -- two flesh-and-blood drivers and my robot -- when the two humans violated a basic traffic rule by swinging wide and turning into the right hand lane.
The Tesla hugged the inside lane, as the driver manual indicates is the proper rule of the road. I wished my teenage son had been watching.
Milo is 15, with a learner's permit. It is my fantasy that when he gets his license, he will develop the memory, rote behaviors and mundane habits that have shown themselves possible in the short life span of self-driving cars. On the other hand, my son is less likely than the Tesla's software to suddenly disengage and just stop steering altogether (requiring me to take over).
The machine and the adolescent each have brains still under development, a human mind governed by millions of years of evolutionary biology, and algorithms shaped by decades of engineers. Seen through the lens of cognition and neuroscience, the contrast says a lot about the next generation of drivers.
For now, only the Tesla (not my son) has been involved in wrecks. The federal government in April reported that Tesla's Autopilot technology was involved 956 crashes between January of 2018, and August of 2023, including 29 fatalities. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report found that, "Autopilot's system controls may be insufficient for a driver assistance system that requires constant supervision by a human driver."
Also recently, Elon Musk concluded talks in Beijing to clear the way with regulators to bring Autopilot to Chinese roads. Lots of other companies are developing their own versions -- General Motors, BMW, Mercedes, Lincoln, Kia, and others -- most that take some control in limited situations, like on the highway.
In short, don't doubt that these cars will be on the road soon enough, as surely as my son will have his license within a year. He inherits a daunting task; statistically speaking driving is the most dangerous regular activity most of us will do in our lives.
Roughly 43,000 people Americans died in crashes in 2021, according to the latest data, a 16-year high, to say nothing of hundreds of thousands of serious injuries. Teen drivers, their brains not fully developed and with less driving experience, have a four times greater risk of crashing than people over 20.
After years of reporting on driver safety, I can say assuredly why we face such risk: a mismatch between the capacity of the human brain and the complexity of the roadway. It presents an onslaught of fast-changing stimulation, inputs and risk. Cars, pedestrians and cyclists dive in and out of our frame, our brains fatigue, get distracted, miss an input; we are human, with biologically limited attention and cognition, piloting a car that is a missile at highway speeds.
From this perspective, I watch my son learn in our Toyota Highlander. To stay focused, he prefers the radio off, and low volume on parental commentary. His solemn task shows in his tight grip of the wheel, the forward lean of his body as if to get a little more connected to what's happening outside the windshield. When he gets in a groove, I ask him to identify the various inputs around him, the car in his blind spot, the cyclist turning right without signaling, the pedestrian looking down at a phone. He gets tired. Driving safely takes effort. For all the control and adolescent glory that comes with taking the wheel, sometimes, he'd just as soon not.
When it comes to supervising our leased Tesla, there is a single aspect of the technology that, to me, highlights the study in contrasts: On the screen, where the map is displayed, an animation shows the surrounding inputs the Tesla picks up with its multiple cameras and sensors. Cars materialize around us, intersections appear as we approach, dotted with the presence of cyclists or pedestrians. It seemingly sees everything, everywhere, all at once, processing multiple streams of information in parallel. For example, when the Tesla "sees" something on the right, it does not do so at the expense of seeing something to the left; my son can only look one way at a time.
The algorithm drives at night, and in the rain. It is exceedingly rule driven. In fact, its strict adherence has caused frustration to other drivers -- and my teen passengers -- by rigorously following the speed limit. One teen passenger said to me: "It's sus," meaning suspect, "because it only goes 20 miles an hour." We were in a school zone.
"Even though automated vehicles are not perfect, they work surprisingly well and are getting better all the time," I was told by David Strayer, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Utah and one of the world's foremost experts on driver distraction. "We really need to focus on relative risk," he added, meaning computers can save many more lives than they risk taking, largely because of their cognitive advantage.
"They don't get distracted. They don't get fatigued. They don't get drunk or high. They speed only if the driver tells them to."
They do glitch, though. On occasion over the last few months since I've been trying the technology, the Tesla's software has suddenly disengaged, requiring me to immediately seize control. I feel like an attendant at a high-speed Disney ride that inexplicably jumps the tracks and heads for the Burger Hut. It is jarring. Take Over! Save Us All!
To be fair, the system warns me constantly to keep my hands on the wheel and be prepared to take over. Sometimes, the auto-driving disengages because I tug too hard on the wheel, suggesting I'm inclined to take over. Other times when it bugs out, who knows what happened inside that mysterious algorithm? Did a one and zero get crossed?
In the federal government's latest report on Tesla's crashes activity, it said the car continues to rely too much of human supervision, and, also, humans aren't always on the job. Crash outcomes can be severe "when a driver is disengaged with the Tesla vehicle operating in Autopilot and the vehicle encounters a circumstance outside of Autopilot's object or event detection response capabilities"
What a potent statement: the car and the human must pay attention when neither of their brains is yet fully suited for the job.
Still, for the moment, I'd trust my son to drive me home before I'd trust the Tesla; I just don't know when the car will check out, or why, and what I could possibly do to discourage this glitch.
Soon enough, humans will relinquish the controls. When that happens, I'm not sure it will be because the robots have virtually limitless cognition and will keep us safer, true though that may be. The real reason that robots will take the wheel is because humans have better things to do than drive. Stream a show, stretch our legs, nap. At that point, when machines rule the road, I can tell my teen to go ahead and watch TikTok behind the wheel, although I guess at that point I wouldn't mind the development of self-watching social media.

E.U. Warns China: Brace For Tariffs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The European Union took the next step toward collecting heavy tariffs on electric vehicles, ahead of a final decision in October.
The European Union took the next step on Thursday toward collecting new tariffs on Chinese electric cars, telling automakers to obtain guarantees from banks that they would be able to pay the taxes set to be made final in October.
The move was expected. The bloc had said on June 12 that it would impose additional tariffs of 17 to 38 percent on electric vehicles imported from China. An investigation by the European Union had found what officials in Brussels describe as unfair subsidies by the Chinese government for electric car manufacturers.
The Chinese government has denied that it subsidizes the industry. Beijing contends that low prices for electric cars made in China reflect vigorous competition and innovation instead.
The two sides began talks on June 22 to try to resolve the dispute. "We are continuing to engage intensively with China on a mutually acceptable solution," said Valdis Dombrovskis, the E.U. trade commissioner.
The imposition of provisional tariffs requires automakers to provide European countries with financial guarantees of eventual payment, although they do not need to send money yet.
The provisional tariffs vary considerably by automaker based on the European Union's estimates of the scale of each Chinese manufacturer's government subsidies. The highest tariffs are being imposed on manufacturers that disclosed little about their subsidies, including a tariff of 37.6 percent on SAIC Motor. Lower tariffs apply to BYD, at 17.4 percent, and Geely, at 19.9 percent.
Tariffs for the American electric vehicle company Tesla, which makes cars in Shanghai for the European market but is ramping up production in Germany, will be calculated individually and might be imposed in the fall.
Automakers will need to guarantee that they will be able to make payment for vehicles that arrive in the European Union starting Friday, for a period that runs through October. However, the bloc must still determine in the coming months if the subsidies for Chinese cars have caused significant harm in Europe's car market.
Worries are spreading among governments around the world that China is seeking to export its way out of economic difficulty as a housing market crash has made Chinese households less willing to spend. In May, President Biden quadrupled U.S. additional tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, to 100 percent.
Turkey imposed 40 percent additional tariffs last month on gasoline-powered and hybrid gasoline-electric cars imported from China. Turkey had already put additional tariffs last year on China's electric cars. On Tuesday, Canada began a trade investigation that could also lead to tariffs on electric cars from China.
Brazil is gradually raising tariffs on electric cars imported from any country starting this month, after a surge in imports from China early this year.
China has threatened to retaliate against the European Union. Its Ministry of Commerce said on June 17 that it had opened an investigation into whether pork from the European Union was being dumped in China at unfairly low prices. The case could result in tariffs on dozens of products, from pork chops to pickled pig intestines.
In January, the commerce ministry began a trade case against imports of Cognac and other European wine-based spirits that come mainly from France. The French government has been an early supporter of tariffs on electric cars from China.
China's car industry has suggested that the ministry impose tariffs on large gasoline-powered cars imported from the European Union if the bloc puts tariffs on electric cars. China has a 40 percent sales tax on cars and sport utility vehicles with very large gasoline engines, almost all of which are imported from North America or Europe.
China also has a basic tariff of 15 percent on imported cars. Europe has a basic tariff for cars of 10 percent and the United States has a 2.5 percent tariff. The various tariffs now being drafted or imposed are in addition to these basic tariffs.
China is returning to the playbook that it followed during its last big trade dispute with the European Union, in 2013 over China's shipments of solar panels to Europe at low prices. Back then, Beijing persuaded Germany to lead a coalition of E.U. member countries that blocked solar panel tariffs.
But it might be harder for China to stop the electric vehicle tariffs. Europe's solar industry was decimated a decade ago after the union rescinded its tariffs. Few in Europe want electric car production to suffer a similar fate.
The European Union has also tightened its rules for countries to overturn tariffs. China would need to win over a majority of member countries in a final vote in October, and those countries would have to represent at least 65 percent of the bloc's population.
Member countries will also hold a preliminary vote in two weeks on whether they support the provisional tariffs. But the vote is not binding on the European Commission, the bloc's executive body.
Chinese automakers are starting to build factories in Europe to meet demand and avoid tariffs, following a strategy pioneered by Japanese automakers to bypass trade restrictions in the United States. "It's just like what Toyota did in the 1980s," said John Zeng, an analyst at GlobalData Automotive.
But China has a glut of car factories at home, with the capacity to build twice as many cars as are sold in China, which is the world's largest car market.
The trade case has produced a split in Europe's car industry. German carmakers have opposed the tariffs. They face steeply declining sales in China as Chinese automakers have gained market share at their expense. So German carmakers are increasingly exporting from their factories in China, including to Europe.
But auto parts manufacturers in Europe have tended to favor the imposition of tariffs, as big automakers like Volkswagen increasingly assemble cars from parts made by Chinese companies.

Auto Sales Grow Slightly Despite Rates and Uncertainty: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: High interest rates, economic uncertainty and a cyberattack appear to have dampened sales in the three months through June.
Much of the auto industry, with the notable exception of Tesla, reported modest sales growth in the three months through June as high interest rates, high vehicle prices and uncertainty about the economy weighed on consumers.
Sales in late June were also slowed by disruptions at car dealers stemming from a cyberattack on a company that supplies software and data services to dealerships.
Cox Automotive, a market research firm, estimated on Tuesday that 4.1 million new cars and trucks were sold in the second quarter in the United States, up a little from the period in 2023. That's a marked slowdown from the year's first three months, when sales grew 5 percent. In the first six months of 2024, 7.9 million new vehicles were sold, an increase of 3 percent from the first half of last year, Cox said.
Slow growth is likely to continue through the end of the year, said Jonathan Smoke, Cox's chief economist. "The market is roiled by uncertainty," he said. "We probably can't quite keep the pace of sales of the first half, but we aren't expecting a collapse in sales."
Cox has forecast that 15.9 million new cars and trucks will be sold in the United States this year. That would be an increase from the 15.5 million sold last year, but still well below the 17 million vehicles sold annually before the pandemic.
General Motors said on Tuesday that it sold nearly 700,000 cars and light trucks in the United States in the second quarter, an increase of less than 1 percent from the period last year. The company said it was its best performance since the fourth quarter of 2020.
The quarterly total included nearly 22,000 electric vehicles, up 40 percent from a year earlier. Almost all were models that use G.M.'s more advanced Ultium battery technology. Its top-selling electric models were the Cadillac Lyriq, a luxury sport utility vehicle, and the Chevrolet Blazer, also an S.U.V.
G.M. said sales in the first six months of 2024 totaled 1.3 million vehicles, down slightly from the same period in 2023.
Toyota sold more than 621,000 vehicles in the second quarter in the United States, an increase of 9 percent from the year-ago period. In the first three months of the year, Toyota's sales rose 20 percent.
The Japanese automaker, the world's largest, is still getting a boost from hybrid and plug-in hybrid models, whose sales have picked up significantly as consumer interest in electric vehicles has tailed off. Toyota sold nearly 250,000 hybrid and electric models in the second quarter, a rise of 63 percent from the period in 2023.
Reflecting the softening demand for E.V.s, Tesla said its global sales fell 4.8 percent, to around 444,000, in the second quarter from the period a year ago. The company's sales have fallen for two consecutive quarters; they declined 8.5 percent in the first three months of the year from a year earlier.
Tesla does not report sales for the U.S. market. Cox estimated that Tesla's U.S. sales fell 16 percent in the second quarter, to 175,000 cars.
The company's global second-quarter sales were higher than analysts had expected, supported by price cuts in some markets and the company's offer of loans carrying an interest rate as low as 1 percent on the Model Y sport utility vehicle.
Tesla once had the market for electric cars almost all to itself, but it has faced growing competition from Chinese carmakers like BYD, Nio and SAIC. The Chinese brands undercut Tesla on price in their home market while offering features like dashboard screens that can be rotated by voice command.
BYD said on Monday that its second-quarter electric vehicle sales jumped 21 percent from a year earlier, and 40 percent when including plug-in hybrid cars.
In Europe, Tesla was in fifth place in April in electric car sales, according to Schmidt Automotive Research, behind Volkswagen; Geely Auto, which owns Volvo and Polestar; Stellantis, which owns Peugeot and Fiat; and BMW.
Tesla's market share for electric vehicles in the United States is expected to fall below 50 percent this year as G.M., Honda and other established carmakers offer models with newer designs than the Model Y and Model 3, which account for 95 percent of Tesla sales.
Stellantis -- the maker of Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep vehicles -- suffered a sales decline of 21 percent in the second quarter, to about 345,000 cars and trucks.
As a result, Stellantis slipped behind Honda and Hyundai-Kia in sales. Honda said its U.S. sales rose 3 percent in the second quarter, to more than 356,000 vehicles. Hyundai and Kia together sold 421,558 cars and trucks.
Ford Motor is expected to report sales figures on Wednesday.
Cox said the average price of new vehicles sold domestically in May was $ 48,389, near the record of about $ 50,000 set at the end of 2022.
High interest rates have also dampened demand. The average interest rate paid on new-vehicle loans in June was 10 percent, the highest in 24 years, Cox said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: VW and Rivian, a maker of electric trucks that has struggled to increase sales and break even, will work together on software and other technologies.
Volkswagen, the German automaker, said on Tuesday that it would invest up to $ 5 billion in Rivian, a maker of electric trucks that has struggled to turn a profit, and that the companies would cooperate on software for electric vehicles.
The deal creates an unusual alliance between the world's second-largest carmaker and an electric vehicle start-up that has strained to live up to investors' expectations that it would achieve the kind of success that made Tesla the world's most valuable automaker.
If successful, the partnership would address weaknesses at both companies. It would provide Volkswagen with the software expertise that auto analysts say it sorely lacks. And Rivian, in addition to cash, would benefit from the manufacturing expertise of an automaker that produces nearly 10 million vehicles a year, putting it just behind Toyota Motor in the global auto industry.
Volkswagen said it would initially invest $ 1 billion in Rivian, and over time increase that to as much as $ 5 billion. If regulators approve the transaction, Volkswagen could become a significant shareholder. The infusion represents a big vote of confidence in Rivian, which loses tens of thousands of dollars on each vehicle it sells.
Rivian's pickups and sport utility vehicles have received glowing reviews in the automotive press, but the company has struggled to ramp up manufacturing at its factory in Normal, Ill. In recent months, many investors have grown worried that the company may not survive long enough to become profitable.
R.J. Scaringe, Rivian's founder and chief executive, said the cash from Volkswagen would help Rivian launch a midsize S.U.V. called the R2 that will sell for about $ 45,000, and to complete a factory in Georgia. Rivian halted construction of the Georgia plant in March in an effort to save more than $ 2 billion.
"This is important for us financially," Mr. Scaringe said of the Volkswagen partnership on a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.
The cheapest vehicle Rivian currently sells, the R1T pickup, starts around $ 70,000, a price that has limited its sales to affluent early adopters. Its R1S S.U.V. starts at $ 75,000. Even at those prices, Rivian lost $ 39,000 for every vehicle it sold in the first three months of the year.
Rivian's stock jumped more than 50 percent in extended trading on Tuesday after the deal was announced.
The electric vehicle market has been divided between relatively young companies like Tesla and Rivian, which make only battery-powered cars, and established carmakers like Volkswagen, General Motors and Toyota, which have often struggled to master the new technology.
Except for Tesla, none of newer U.S. carmakers specializing in electric vehicles have won significant market share. Some, like Fisker and Lordstown Motors, have ceased production and filed for bankruptcy protection.
Auto analysts have long considered Rivian among the electric vehicle start-ups most likely to survive, in part because it has raised billions of dollars in investment. Amazon is one of its largest shareholders and the main customer for the company's delivery vans.
But Volkswagen and Rivian operate very differently, and it could be a challenge for them to work together. Volkswagen, which is based in Wolfsburg, Germany, is known for rigid, top-down management and is owned in part by the state of Lower Saxony. Rivian, based in Irvine, Calif., has the more freewheeling culture of a technology start-up. Rivian said in April that it expected to sell 57,000 vehicles this year, far fewer than Volkswagen sells in a week.
Mr. Scaringe and Oliver Blume, the chief executive of Volkswagen, said the deal blossomed after the two met at a Porsche customer center and bonded over their love of cars.
"We have a very similar mind-set," Mr. Blume said during the conference call.
Ford Motor was for a time a big shareholder in Rivian, and the two companies once said they would build S.U.V.s together. But that plan never came to fruition, and Ford sold most of its Rivian shares. Ford and Volkswagen have a separate partnership that includes joint development and production of electric vehicles.
The Volkswagen-Rivian alliance could encourage other established carmakers to consider investments or partnerships connecting them with start-ups like Lucid Motors -- companies that have well-regarded technology but are unprofitable and struggling to establish themselves in a crowded market. Another large automaker, Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Fiat and Peugeot, has invested in a Chinese company, Leapmotor, for access to its electric car technology.
Vehicles using the software developed by the new joint venture will go on sale during the second half of the decade, Volkswagen said. Any of Volkswagen's brands, which include Audi and Porsche, could use the technology, Mr. Blume said. Scout, the American off-road brand that Volkswagen is reviving at a factory under construction in South Carolina, could also use the software.
But Volkswagen and Rivian will continue to market their vehicles separately.

With Lowered Re-election Vote, Toyota's Leader Gets a Rebuke: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A relatively low 71.9 percent of shareholders supported Akio Toyoda, who has faced scrutiny over governance issues, in his bid to remain chairman.
Investor support for Toyota Motor's longtime leader, Akio Toyoda, sank to its lowest level since he took the helm as shareholders challenged the extent of control he exerts over the company.
According to a filing released on Wednesday, 71.9 percent of shareholders supported renominating Mr. Toyoda as chairman of Toyota's board. That met the threshold required for re-election, but it was the lowest level of support for him since at least 2010, after Mr. Toyoda's first full year as chief executive.
"In the context of corporate Japan, it's a surprising figure," Hirotaka Uchida, partner at the consultancy Arthur D. Little, said of Mr. Toyoda's renomination vote result. Shareholders want to see changes made to Toyota's governance and the level of influence Mr. Toyoda holds within the company, he said: "That has been made quite obvious."
Traditionally in Japan, board members receive nearly unanimous support from shareholders, and Mr. Toyoda, whose grandfather founded the company, has gotten an average approval of more than 96 percent over the past decade. But that national trend has started to change in recent years, with more investors using their votes to pressure companies to enhance profitability and corporate governance.
Ahead of Toyota's shareholder meeting on Tuesday, The New York Times reported that several big investors planned to vote against Mr. Toyoda's reappointment. They questioned whether recent problems with mishandled vehicle tests might indicate broader governance issues within Toyota, including inadequate checks and balances on management.
"Toyota's shareholders have now sent a strong signal that better governance is needed at the very top of the company," said Anders Schelde, chief investment officer at AkademikerPension, a Danish fund. "We share the concerns expressed and expect the chairman to reflect on the best interest of the company when deciding his next move."
Mr. Uchida of Arthur D. Little said there is very little chance that this year's lower approval rating would lead to something as big as Mr. Toyoda stepping down. "But it may mean that he takes a step back, at least from public view," he said.
During Toyota's annual meeting at its headquarters in Toyota City, southwest of Tokyo, Mr. Toyoda defended his active role within the company. He said he would assume responsibility for addressing the problems within Toyota that led it to violate vehicle-certification tests.
Mr. Toyoda's comments reflected his enduring view of himself as a leader who, after guiding Toyota through numerous challenges during his nearly 14-year tenure at the top, continues to serve as a "rear guard," shielding the company from setbacks so that others can maintain forward momentum.
According to figures released on Wednesday, 95.4 percent of shareholders voted in favor of Koji Sato, who took over from Mr. Toyoda as chief executive last year. That was slightly below last year's figure, 96.8 percent.
Toyota said in a statement that it was strengthening its governance practices and had clarified the roles and expectations of its executives and redefined how it assesses the independence of directors.
"We perceive the approval rates at this year's shareholders' meeting as candid feedback from institutional investors," Toyota said. "Moving forward, we will continue to value dialogue with our shareholders, sincerely taking their feedback to heart and addressing it."

Chairman Defends Grip On the Reins At Toyota: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Akio Toyoda, who stepped down as chief executive last year, had been criticized by some shareholders for continuing to dominate decision making at the automaker.
Toyota Motor's longtime leader, Akio Toyoda, defended his continued deep involvement in the company's operations on Tuesday, responding to calls by some big investors that he step back after having resigned as chief executive more than a year ago.
"Some infer that what I do and how I act is akin to cloistered rule," Mr. Toyoda said, referring to an imperial form of government in Japan where an emperor could retain power and influence even after abdication.
"I consult with younger-generation executives and give them my advice, and if you call this cloistered rule, then I am happy to continue acting as a cloistered-government leader," Mr. Toyoda, 68, said at a shareholder meeting at Toyota's headquarters southwest of Tokyo.
Mr. Toyoda was responding to questions posed by several shareholders asking whether recent problems over mishandled safety tests may reflect broader governance problems within Toyota, including insufficient checks and balances on management.
Toyota's shareholder meeting, presided over by Koji Sato, the chief executive, was widely viewed as a referendum on what kind of role Mr. Toyoda should hold within Toyota, nearly 15 months after he stepped down as chief executive to become chairman. Some investors and Toyota insiders view the level of influence Mr. Toyoda maintains within the automaker as a governance problem, The New York Times reported on Monday.
At the end of the meeting, Toyota announced that all 10 of the directors it had nominated, including Mr. Toyoda, had received the majority votes needed for reappointment. Toyota said it would release vote figures on Wednesday.
In Japan's consensus-based corporate culture, board members are often re-elected with nearly unanimous support.
This year, Mr. Toyoda's approval rating is expected to have taken a hit, with a number of investor groups and proxy advisers -- firms that guide institutional investors on how to vote their shares -- having urged his ouster as chairman.
Earlier this month, Mr. Toyoda pledged to personally tackle the vehicle testing problems, which are being investigated by the Japanese government.
Those opposing Mr. Toyoda's role as chairman say that his insistence that he would clean up the testing mess underscored concerns about his reluctance to relinquish control of the company founded by his grandfather close to a century ago.
Mr. Toyoda, who was named chief executive in 2009, spent his first years in office navigating Toyota through the turmoil caused by reports that the company's vehicles were accelerating uncontrollably. He has described himself as Toyota's "rear guard," overseeing the company so that others could carry out its plans.
In a letter circulated around the time he handed over the chief executive role, Mr. Toyoda said he felt that by sorting out Toyota's problems over his nearly 14 years as chief executive, he had freed up Mr. Sato, 54, to pursue new opportunities.

"I will leave the job of creating the future in the capable hands of the next generation," Mr. Toyoda wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by The Times. "And for myself," he wrote, "I will probably continue to fight against the evils of the past."

Will Toyota's Ex-C.E.O. Ever Let Go of His Power?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Akio Toyoda ran Toyota for 14 years before handing the reins to a new C.E.O. last year, but some have grown concerned about the control he still wields.
During his long tenure as chief executive, Akio Toyoda led Toyota Motor to the top of the car industry.
Toyota today sells more cars than any other automaker in the world. It was Mr. Toyoda's bet on the enduring popularity of hybrid gas-electric vehicles that last year helped Toyota achieve the biggest annual profit in Japanese history.
Mr. Toyoda, whose grandfather founded Toyota in 1937, is the force that propels the company -- and that is a problem, according to multiple people inside and outside of Toyota.
In early 2023, Mr. Toyoda stepped down after nearly 14 years as chief executive to become chairman. But a little more than a year after the new chief executive took over, some Toyota board members have flagged concerns that Mr. Toyoda is continuing to drive major projects and may retain too much unchecked sway within the company.
Several big Toyota investors said they planned to vote against his re-election to the board of directors ahead of the company's annual shareholder meeting, which will be held on Tuesday.
"You have a case of a particularly empowered executive sitting in a chairman's role," said Michael Garland, the head of corporate governance at the New York City Comptroller's Office, which manages the city's more than $ 260 billion retirement fund system. "Toyota's need for more independent board oversight is significant."
Replacing successful chief executives, especially those with long tenures, is often tricky. Companies must make sure they clear a smooth path for successors to take over without undermining business practices that are working and, most important, producing profits.
"Not having ample checks and balances is just bad governance, but course correct too much and a company can just lose its momentum completely," said Howard Yu, director of IMD Business School's advanced management program. "Toyota is at this critical juncture."
Mr. Toyoda, 68, navigated Toyota through several bruising episodes as chief executive. In 2009, when he took over, the global financial meltdown put the company in the red, and Toyota was starting to contend with a series of quality problems that would balloon into the worst crisis in its history.
In 2009 and 2010, Toyota recalled millions of vehicles for repairs after reports emerged of its vehicles accelerating uncontrollably. Toyota would eventually face hundreds of wrongful-death and personal-injury lawsuits and be hit with a $ 1.2 billion fine by the United States Justice Department.
In 2010, Mr. Toyoda apologized to Congress and vowed to change what he said was a disconnect between Toyota's executives in Japan and the company's global operations. He slimmed down the executive ranks, transferred power to regional heads and cut costs. Toyota's sales climbed.
In recent years, Mr. Toyoda became known for his comments warning politicians and industry officials not to move too quickly toward electric vehicles, before consumers were ready to leave behind their gasoline-powered cars.
While other automakers in the United States, Europe and China started a sharp shift to electric vehicles, Toyota continued to invest in the hybrid cars it pioneered in the late 1990s. That frequently made Mr. Toyoda the target of criticism by environmental groups.
In January 2023, Toyota announced that a longtime Toyota engineer, Koji Sato, would take over as chief executive. Mr. Toyoda said Mr. Sato, 53 at the time, had the skills necessary to guide Toyota into a new age of electric and software-driven cars.
Shortly after Mr. Sato took over, global car market dynamics shifted. Electric vehicle sales cooled, and demand for hybrid cars skyrocketed, generating a windfall for Toyota. Toyota posted more than 5 trillion yen ( $ 32 billion) in operating profit for the fiscal year that ended in March, the largest ever recorded for a Japanese company.
Internally, people at Toyota said the recent earnings -- and the company's expected strong performance over the next three to four years -- should be credited to Mr. Toyoda for having mapped out the electric vehicle transition.
"Akio Toyoda has been proven right," said Jeffrey Liker, who heads the Ann Arbor, Mich., consulting firm Liker Lean Advisors and has written extensively about Toyota and its management.
Despite having stepped down as chief executive, Mr. Toyoda "may have more influence than he wants, even, by virtue of the fact that when he offers an opinion people now take it as the word of God," Mr. Liker said.
Still, while Toyota's profits are soaring, some board members have grown concerned that the success is further cementing what they see as a potentially problematic concentration of power by Mr. Toyoda, according to three people with knowledge of the situation who were not authorized to speak about internal matters.
Mr. Toyoda made big changes to Toyota management in recent years, and six new directors were appointed to the board in 2023. Earlier this year, Ikuro Sugawara, an outside director, told a Japanese magazine that the moves had left Mr. Toyoda surrounded by people who do not question him.
"Mr. Akio has changed," the magazine, Shukan Bunshun, quoted Mr. Sugawara saying in an interview that got little attention outside of Japan. "He used to have people around him who voiced their opinions." Toyota did not make Mr. Sugawara available for an interview.
Some members of Toyota management see Mr. Toyoda as playing the role of both chairman and chief executive, commanding the room in meetings and continuing to drive major company initiatives, such as plans for a new line of combustion engines for hybrid cars announced last month, according to the three people with knowledge of the situation. Some directors believe a slow handoff of authority is appropriate, as Mr. Sato learns from his longtime boss, one of the people said.
Toyota did not respond to requests for comment.
The internal commotion has attracted attention from investors. People at seven large investor groups, some of which were not authorized to speak publicly, told The New York Times that they planned to vote against re-electing Mr. Toyoda because of concerns about the board's independence.
Two prominent firms that advise investors on corporate matters, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, have urged shareholders to vote against Mr. Toyoda's re-election because of governance issues and what they see as his responsibility for testing problems in Japan disclosed recently by Toyota and some of its group companies.
In Japan, board members are often re-elected with near unanimous shareholder support, and investors voting against Mr. Toyoda's reappointment are likely to remain a small minority. Over the past decade, Mr. Toyoda's reappointment votes have received an average approval of more than 96 percent.
Last year was Mr. Toyoda's final year leading Toyota's annual shareholder meeting, which was held at its headquarters in Toyota City, southwest of Tokyo. Mr. Toyoda teared up and said he was looking forward to seeing the future Mr. Sato would create for Toyota.
This year will be the first time Mr. Sato will preside over the meeting.
According to Mr. Yu, of the IMD Business School, how Toyota navigates the succession could determine the company's future.
"A company would want to transition power to a new generation to take itself in a new direction," Mr. Yu said. "The key question to ask about Toyota is does it, right now, need to reinvent -- or not."

Full text: To witness the kingdom's profound transformation and assess its ambitious tourism projects, a Times journalist spent a month on the road there. Here's what he saw.
Wandering alone along the southern fringes of Saudi Arabia's mountainous Asir Province, some eight miles from the Yemeni border, in a nondescript town with a prominent sculpture of a rifle balanced on an ornately painted plinth, I met a man, Nawab Khan, who was building a palace out of mud.
Actually, he was rebuilding the structure, restoring it. And when I came across him, he hadn't yet begun his work for the day; he was seated on the side of the road beneath its red-and-white windows -- cross-legged, on a rug, leaning over a pot of tea and a bowl of dates.
Two weeks earlier, on the far side of the country, a fellow traveler had pointed at a map and described the crumbling buildings here, in Dhahran al-Janub, arranged in a colorful open-air museum. Finding myself nearby, I'd detoured to have a look -- and there was Mr. Khan, at first looking at me curiously and then waving me over to join him. Sensing my interest in the cluster of irregular towers, he stood up, produced a large key ring and began opening a series of padlocks. When he vanished through a doorway, I followed him into a shadowy stairwell.
This, of course, was my mother's worst nightmare: Traveling solo, I'd been coaxed by a stranger into an unlit building in a remote Saudi village, within a volatile border area that the U.S. Department of State advises Americans to stay away from.
By now, though, more than halfway through a 5,200-mile road trip, I trusted Mr. Khan's enthusiasm as a genuine expression of pride, not a ploy. All across Saudi Arabia, I'd seen countless projects being built, from simple museums to high-end resorts. These were the early fruits of an $ 800 billion investment in the travel sector, itself part of a much larger effort, Vision 2030, to remake the kingdom and reduce its economic dependence on oil.
But I'd begun to see the building projects as something else, too: the striving of a country -- long shrouded to most Westerners -- to be seen, reconsidered, accepted. And with its doors suddenly flung open and the pandemic behind us, visitors like me were finally beginning to witness this new Saudi Arabia, much to Mr. Khan's and all the other builders' delight.
Few countries present as complicated a prospect for travelers as Saudi Arabia.
Long associated with Islamic extremism, human rights abuses and the oppression of women, the kingdom has made strides in recent years to refashion its society and its reputation abroad.
The infamous religious police, which upheld codes of conduct based on an ultraconservative interpretation of Islam, were stripped of their power. Public concerts, once banned, are now ubiquitous. Women have been granted new rights -- including the freedom to drive and to travel without permission from a male guardian -- and are no longer required to wear floor-length robes in public or to cover their hair.
These changes are part of a broad set of strategies to diversify the kingdom's economy, elevate its status in the world and soften its image -- the last of which is a tall order for a government that has killed a newspaper columnist, kidnapped and tortured dissidents, precipitated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen and imprisoned people for supporting gay rights, among a number of other recent abuses.
Central to the transformations led by 38-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler, is a major push for international visitors. It represents a sea change in a country that, until 2019, issued no nonreligious tourist visas and instead catered almost exclusively to Muslim pilgrims visiting Mecca and Medina, Islam's two holiest cities. In February, by contrast, my tourist e-visa was approved online in minutes.
Saudi Arabia has already transformed one of its premier destinations -- Al-Ula, with its UNESCO-listed Nabatean tombs -- from a neglected collection of archaeological sites into a lavish retreat with a bevy of activities on offer, including guided tours, wellness festivals, design exhibitions and hot air balloon rides.
Another project will create a vast array of luxury resorts on or near the Red Sea.
Still more projects include the development of Diriyah, the birthplace of the first Saudi state; the preservation and development of the coastal city of Jeddah; an offshore theme park called the Rig; and Neom, the futuristic city that has garnered the lion's share of attention.
All told, the country is hoping to draw 70 million international tourists per year by 2030, with tourism contributing 10 percent of its gross domestic product. (In 2023, the country logged 27 million international tourists, according to government figures, with tourism contributing about 4 percent of G.D.P.)
To get a sense of these projects and the changes unfolding in Saudi society, I spent a month exploring the kingdom by car. I traveled alone, without a fixer, driver or translator. Per New York Times ethics guidelines, I declined the government's many offers of discounts and complimentary services.
Much of the time I felt I'd been tossed the keys to the kingdom. But there were moments, too, when I faced a more complicated reality, one epitomized by a road sign that forced me to abruptly exit the highway some 15 miles from the center of Mecca. "Obligatory for Non Muslims," it read, pointing to the offramp.
To me, the sign broadcast the lines being drawn to compartmentalize the country, which is now marketing itself to two sets of travelers with increasingly divergent -- and sometimes contradictory -- expectations: luxury tourists at ease with bikinis and cocktails, and pilgrims prepared for modesty and strict religious adherence. It's hard to know whether the kingdom can satisfy both without antagonizing either.
My trip began in Jeddah, where, after spending two days exploring its historic district, I rented a car and drove eight hours north to Al-Ula, a benchmark for the new Saudi tourism initiatives.
The name Al-Ula refers to both a small city and a broader region packed with attractions: Hegra, the kingdom's first UNESCO World Heritage site and its biggest archaeological draw, is a 30-minute drive north of Old Town, a maze of crumbling mud-brick buildings now partly restored. Between the two, and fanning out to the east and west, are several other archaeological sites, as well as a smattering of resorts, event spaces and adventure outfitters. Farther northeast, beyond Hegra, is the Sharaan Nature Reserve, a vast protected zone used for conservation efforts.
My first priority during my five-day stay in Al-Ula was a visit to Hegra.
Like Petra, its better-known counterpart in Jordan, Hegra was built by the Nabateans, an ancient people who flourished 2,000 years ago. The site contains more than 100 tombs that were carved from solid rock, their entrances adorned with embellishments. Most impressive among them, set apart and standing some 70 feet tall, is a tomb colloquially called the Lonely Castle.
Not long ago, visitors could hire private guides and wander the area on foot, climbing in and out of -- and no doubt damaging -- the many tombs. Not anymore: I boarded an air-conditioned tour bus and zipped past most of them, stopping at just four locations.
At the penultimate stop, we exited the bus and trudged several hundred feet along a sandy path to the front of the Lonely Castle. Even in the late afternoon, the heat was stifling. I craned my neck to take in the details of the sculpted facade, which emerged like a mirage from one side of a massive boulder: its four pilasters, the rough chisel marks near the bottom, its characteristic five-stepped crown. Ten minutes evaporated, and I turned to find my group being shepherded back onto the bus. I jogged through the sand to catch up.
A few miles north of Hegra, I hopped in the back of a Toyota Land Cruiser -- accompanied by an Italian graduate student and his mother -- for a drive through the sandy expanse of the Sharaan Nature Reserve.
The scenery was sublime: Slipping through a narrow slot canyon, we emerged into a vast, open desert plain, then settled into a wide valley enclosed by an amphitheater of cliffs. Occasionally our guide stopped and led us on short hikes to petroglyphs, some pockmarked by bullet holes, or to lush fields of wildflowers, where he plucked edible greens and invited us to sample their lemony tang.
Gabriele Morelli, the graduate student, had first come to Al-Ula a few years ago -- a different era, he said, given how quickly the place had transformed. He described a version that no longer exists, rife with cheap accommodation, lax rules and a free-for-all sensibility.
Some of the changes, of course, have been necessary to protect delicate ecosystems and archaeological sites from ever-growing crowds. But several people I met in Al-Ula -- Saudis and foreigners alike -- quietly lamented the extent of the high-end development and the steady erosion of affordability. Many of the new offerings, like the Banyan Tree resort, they pointed out, are luxury destinations that cater to wealthy travelers.
These hushed criticisms were among my early lessons on how difficult it can be to gauge the way Saudis feel about the pace and the pervasiveness of the transformations reshaping their society.
I got a taste of Al-Ula's exclusivity -- and of the uncanniness that occasionally surfaced throughout my trip -- at a Lauryn Hill concert in an event space called Maraya. To reach the hall, I passed through a security gate, where an attendant scanned my e-ticket and directed me two miles up a winding road into the heart of the Ashar Valley, home to several high-end restaurants and resorts.
Rounding the final bend, I felt as if I'd stumbled into a computer-generated image: Ant-size humans were dwarfed by a reflective structure that both asserted itself and blended into the landscape. Inside, waiters served hors d'oeuvres and brightly colored mocktails to a chic young crowd.
The surreality peaked when, midway through the show, I left my plush seat to join some concertgoers near the stage -- only to turn and see John Bolton, former President Donald J. Trump's national security adviser, seated in the front row.
Where else, I wondered, could I attend a rap concert in the middle of the desert with a longtime fixture of the Republican Party -- amid a crowd that cheered when Ms. Hill mentioned Palestine -- but this strange new corner of Saudi Arabia?
After Al-Ula, I drove to another of the kingdom's extravagant schemes: the Red Sea project, billed as the "world's most ambitious regenerative tourism destination." After weaving through a morass of construction-related traffic, I boarded a yacht -- alongside a merry band of Saudi influencers -- and was piloted some 15 miles to a remote island, where I disembarked in a world of unqualified opulence at the St. Regis Red Sea Resort.
I was chauffeured around in an electric golf cart -- past 43 beachside "dune" villas and onto two long boardwalks that connect the rest of the resort to 47 "coral" villas, built on stilts over shallow turquoise water. Along the way, I listened to Lucas Julien-Vauzelle, an executive assistant manager, wax poetic about sustainability. "We take it to the next level," he said, before rattling off a list of facts and figures: 100 percent renewable energy, a solar-powered 5G network, plans to enhance biologically diverse habitats.
By 2030, he said, the Red Sea project will offer 50 hotels across its island and inland sites. Citing the Maldives, he mentioned the kingdom's plans to claim a share of the same high-end market.
Another prediction came by way of Keith Thornton, the director of restaurants, who said he expects the resort to legally serve alcohol by the end of the year. (While a liquor store for non-Muslim diplomats recently opened in Riyadh, the Saudi government has made no indication that it plans to reconsider its broader prohibition of alcohol.)
The hotel was undeniably impressive. But there's an inescapable irony to a lavish resort built at unfathomable expense in the middle of the sea -- with guests ferried out by chartered boat and seaplane -- that flaunts its aspirations for sustainability.
Toward the end of my several-hour visit, I learned that every piece of vegetation, including 646 palm trees, had been transplanted from an off-site nursery. Later, reviewing historical satellite images, I found visual evidence that the island -- described to me as pristine -- had been dramatically fortified and, in the process, largely remade. Its footprint had also been significantly altered. It was, in a sense, an artificial island built where a smaller natural island once stood.
Something else struck me, too: The place was nearly empty, save for the staff and the Saudi influencers. Granted, the resort had just opened the month before -- but the same was true at the nearby Six Senses Southern Dunes, an inland Red Sea resort that opened in November. Fredrik Blomqvist, the general manager there, told me that its isolated location in a serene expanse of desert -- part of its appeal -- also presented a challenge in drawing customers. "The biggest thing," he said, "is to get the message out that the country is open."
Since the country began issuing tourist visas, influencers have been documenting their experiences in places like Jeddah and Al-Ula, their trips often paid for by the Saudi government. Their breezy content contributes to the impression that the kingdom is awaiting discovery by foreign visitors with out-of-date prejudices. To an extent, for a certain segment of tourists, that's true.
For many travelers, though, the depiction of the kingdom as an uncomplicated getaway could be dangerously misleading.
Speech in Saudi Arabia is strictly limited; dissent is not tolerated -- nor is the open practice of any religion other than the government's interpretation of Islam. In its travel advisory, the U.S. Department of State warns that "social media commentary -- including past comments -- which Saudi authorities may deem critical, offensive, or disruptive to public order, could lead to arrest." Punishment for Saudi nationals has been far worse: In 2023, a retired teacher was sentenced to death after he criticized the ruling family via anonymous accounts. As of late 2023, he remained in prison.
Other restrictions are harder to parse. L.G.B.T.Q. travelers are officially welcome in the kingdom but face a conundrum: They might face arrest or other criminal penalties for openly expressing their sexual orientation or gender identity. As recently as 2021, an independent U.S. federal agency included Saudi Arabia on a list of countries where same-sex relationships are punishable by death, noting that "the government has not sought this penalty in recent years."
When asked how he would convince a same-sex couple that it was safe to visit, Jerry Inzerillo, a native New Yorker and the group chief executive of Diriyah, said: "We don't ask you any questions when you come into the country or when you leave."
"Maybe that's not conclusive enough," he added, "but a lot of people have come."
Female travelers might also face difficulties, since advancements in women's rights are not equally distributed throughout the kingdom.
The changes were more visible in big cities and tourist centers. Ghydda Tariq, an assistant marketing manager in Al-Ula, described how new professional opportunities had emerged for her in recent years. Maysoon, a young woman I met in Jeddah, made extra money by occasionally driving for Uber. Haneen Alqadi, an employee at the St. Regis Red Sea, described how women there are free to wear bikinis without fear of repercussions.
Outside such places, though, I sometimes went for days without seeing more than a handful of women, invariably wearing niqabs, let alone seeing them engaged in public life or tourism. My photographs reflect that imbalance.
As an easily identifiable Western man, I moved through the country with an array of advantages: the kindness and cheery curiosity of strangers, the ease of passage at military checkpoints, and the freedom to interact with a male-dominated society at markets, museums, parks, restaurants, cafes. Not all travelers could expect the same treatment.
Roaming in the far north and south, I often found the earlier version of the kingdom -- with lax rules and less development -- that had been described to me in Al-Ula.
I trekked to the northern city of Sakaka to see an archaeological site promoted as the Stonehenge of Saudi Arabia: a set of monoliths called the Rajajil Columns thought to have been erected some 6,000 years ago but about which little is definitively known.
My heart sank when I pulled into the parking lot after a five-hour drive and found the columns blocked by a tall fence. Approaching on foot, though, I noticed that a section of the fence had been peeled back and that visitors were wandering freely among the stones, which protruded from the earth like isolated clusters of crooked teeth. I joined the small crowd, if hesitatingly, and was surprised to find no footpaths, nor anything to keep us a safe distance from the columns. In the end I wondered if our access had been officially approved or informally arranged.
My travel experiences were sometimes awkward in other ways, too.
Standing just outside the grounds of the central mosque in Medina, where the Prophet Muhammad is buried, I was detained by a stern member of the Special Forces. (Even after 2019, non-Muslim tourists remained barred from Mecca and Medina, Islam's two holiest cities. The ban was relaxed in parts of Medina in 2021.)
The guard interrogated me and, after calling a colleague to confer, demanded that I leave the area. "Go," he said threateningly. Another traveler who witnessed the encounter scurried away to avoid a similar fate.
The unsettling exchange cast a pall over my time in the city, which few non-Muslims have seen. As far as I knew, I'd abided by the rules by staying outside the grounds of the Prophet's Mosque -- a boundary line that I'd confirmed with tourism officials beforehand.
More than anything, family and friends wanted to know if I felt safe on my trip -- and I did, almost without exception. Petty crime in Saudi Arabia is exceedingly rare. And while parts of the country are under a Level 4 "Do Not Travel" advisory, even my rambling itinerary was approved by a security expert.
Instead of fearing for my safety, I was often preoccupied with how I'd fairly portray a place that elicited such a range of conflicting emotions: joy and distress, excitement and apprehension, sincerity and doubt. So much lay hidden from public view -- like the collective anguish over the war raging in Gaza. And so little was easy to categorize, in part because the warmth of everyday Saudis was strikingly at odds with the ruthlessness of their authoritarian government.
In Riyadh, a young man warned me not to speak openly with strangers. "People get arrested here for a tweet," he said. "Can you imagine?"
I could, actually. The Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi had chronicled his government's increasingly draconian responses to criticism. "Repression and intimidation are not -- and never should be -- the acceptable companions of reform," he wrote in The Washington Post in 2018, just months before he was killed and dismembered at his country's consulate in Istanbul.
Were we to travel only where we feel comfortable and unchallenged, we'd all be poorer for it. But the question of whether to travel to Saudi Arabia is thornier than that.
It's easy to see one response, "No," as yielding to closed-mindedness at the expense of ordinary people -- like the kindly vendor Abdullah, who served me local honey at his shop in the southern mountains.
But it's easy, too, to see "Yes" as an affirmation that might makes right, that amusement outweighs morality, that princely wealth can wipe a stained slate clean.
Ten days into my trip, I ventured to Wadi al-Disah, a steep-walled valley where I'd booked a tent at a campsite I found on Airbnb. For an additional 300 riyals ( $ 80), my host, Faisal, led me on a four-wheel-drive tour, departing the paved road and weaving through a path along the bed of an ephemeral river. Continually jolted by the uneven terrain, we eased past thick reeds, lofty palms and small bands of visitors who'd nestled into clearings.
As we left, I met a group of young men gathered for a picnic, their sandals scattered around a carpet on which they were preparing their dinner. Delighted to meet an American with a camera, they asked if I'd take a group portrait, then exchanged information with me so I could send them a copy -- a scenario by then so familiar that I hardly thought anything of it.
A full day later, some 200 miles away, I was cruising along a lonely highway near the Jordanian border when a Land Cruiser blew past me at an astonishing speed. I felt my compact car rock from its turbulence -- and then I watched with a twinge of dread as the car abruptly braked, slowing hard in the left lane until our front ends were aligned. It held steady there.
For a moment I stared straight ahead, hoping to avoid a confrontation. When I finally turned to look, I saw a group of boys grinning wildly and waving through an open window. Then I realized: Improbably, it was three of the young men I'd met the day before. Somehow we'd all followed the same route. And somehow, in the split second it took them to fly past, they'd recognized me. I lifted my camera from the passenger seat and snapped a photograph.
The picture shows three young Saudis on a precipice: endearing, erratic, captivating. I have a sense of where they came from but no certainty about where they're going. Two are flashing peace signs, and none appears to be wearing a seatbelt. No one is watching the road as their car drifts out of its lane, careening a little recklessly into a hopeful and uncertain future.

From a Formula One Exit To Le Mans in 11 Months: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He lost his job in Formula 1, but was grabbed by Toyota to drive in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
Last July, Nyck de Vries, a driver for the Formula 1 team AlphaTauri, was dismissed 10 Grands Prix into his rookie season.
Eleven months later, de Vries has the opportunity to win one of the most prestigious races in motorsport this weekend when he competes in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
"It is no secret that Le Mans is one of the most iconic races in the world as a single stand-alone event," de Vries said in an interview in May. "Everyone who competes in the F.I.A. World Endurance Championship is very motivated and determined to excel at that particular race.
"You could almost ask yourself the question whether Le Mans is bigger than the whole championship. I don't fully agree with that because I do really value a world championship, but Le Mans has all the history, and that makes it very special."
De Vries will drive the No. 7 Toyota GR010 Hybrid with Kamui Kobayashi and Mike Conway, W.E.C. champions in 2020 and 2021, and who won Le Mans in 2021 with Toyota. De Vries was the reserve driver, but never raced.
It was a role he relinquished last year when he joined AlphaTauri. De Vries replaced José María López, who had partnered with Kobayashi and Conway in their Le Mans victories. The opportunity has been a long time coming.
"As a driver, you want to be in the racing seat, but I think the relationship with Toyota has been great," de Vries said. "It was always the common target to prepare me to step up. I had full faith in the common intentions and also belief in my ability.
"Things still need to work out and the timing has to be right. I was fortunate after what happened with AlphaTauri. Toyota was very supportive, and they have helped me fulfill my dream. When I became available, it was very straightforward to rejoin forces again."
Kobayashi, Conway and López spent seven years together with Toyota. "In motorsport, things are constantly evolving, and it's the same with driver lineups," Kobayashi, who is also the team principal, told the team's website.
"Mike, José and I drove together since 2017, which is a long time in any category. We enjoyed some amazing moments together, but also some tough times, particularly at Le Mans."
Kobayashi said de Vries was "quick and consistent." The trio won their first race, the 6 Hours of Imola, in April. It was de Vries's first victory in any category since he won in Formula E with Mercedes in May 2022.
De Vries said he would have accepted third place that weekend, "but the execution from the whole team, including my teammates, was just flawless. Everyone delivered 100 percent. It shows you can outperform your competitors when they are quicker, but you're better in execution."
The season is unusual for de Vries. He is dovetailing his commitments in the W.E.C. with Toyota with driving in Formula E with Mahindra Racing.
De Vries, who was Formula E champion with Mercedes in 2021, was offered a multiyear contract by Mahindra after he left Formula 1.
In contrast to Toyota, Mahindra is uncompetitive. De Vries has scored only six points from 10 races, with his best finish seventh in Shanghai. He sat out the race in Berlin in May because it took place on the same weekend as the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps.
"They are two very different teams and championships," de Vries said. "Fortunately, with Toyota, which is a very successful team with a lot of success over the past decade in W.E.C., it's great to be fighting at the front and challenging for the top positions.
"With Mahindra, the project has a different approach. The team had a difficult year last year, and the hardware," referring to the powertrain, "hasn't changed from last year to this year, so we can't expect miracles. But with all the changes that are happening, the team is on the right trajectory."
De Vries is aware he is part of a long-term project as Mahindra "builds a foundation for the future," he said. With Toyota, "the expectations are much higher."
Toyota won the Le Mans from 2018 to 2022. Its run ended last year when Kobayashi, Conway and López failed to finish, and the Toyota sister car of Sébastien Buemi, Ryo Hirakawa and Brendon Hartley was second.
"Obviously, we experience more disappointment at Toyota when we're not competitive and fighting for victories," de Vries said. "But that balance across the two series is really cool and encouraging to experience."
De Vries is no stranger to Le Mans. He competed in the LMP2 category with Racing Team Nederland in 2019 and 2020, G-Drive Racing the following year and TDS Racing x Vaillante in 2022 when he was fourth in class and eighth over all.
Toyota is expected to challenge for victory in the top Hypercar class this year, but it faces strong opposition from Porsche, Alpine, BMW, Peugeot and Ferrari, last year's winner.
"It's hard to have clear expectations," de Vries said. "It depends on what I want to base my expectations on. If purely on the first couple of events [in the W.E.C.], I would say some of our competitors have the edge over us. If I base it on pure historical numbers, I have faith that we are competitive.
"I don't have a crystal ball, and I don't know what we can expect, but I would like to think and hope we are quick enough to fight for the main victory."
De Vries knows the Circuit de la Sarthe, where the race is held, can bite a driver at any time and quickly wreck ambitions. "Obviously, you have to be quick, and execution is key, making sure that individually and collectively we are on top of our game, not making any mistakes," he said.
"But Le Mans always has something unexpected for you. Hopefully, Le Mans chooses us to win."

To Understand Musk's Descent, Look at His $46 Billion Pay Package: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Elon Musk is not just another inconsequential Silicon Valley billionaire.
Most of his inconsequential peers have two primary accomplishments: showing up at the right place at the right time and being sufficiently arrogant to continue the course rather than diversify. Had their shoes been empty, someone else would have stepped into them, and things would have been much the same.
But Mr. Musk changed the world.
He wanted to jump-start the decarbonization of human civilization's energy. He succeeded. He drove Tesla to create the electric vehicle industry as we know it. Yes, he overpromised. But he often overdelivered and overdelivered spectacularly. Truly wonderful things happened with Tesla's performance as a technology inventor, deliverer and deployer.
But "happened" is in the past tense. Much has changed since 2018, the year Tesla dreamed up an unorthodox pay package that, in theory, tied Mr. Musk's pay to the company's performance. Problem is, the performance was not for making high-quality cars or making affordable cars or making cars at scale. The performance was for pushing Tesla's stock price up.
This pay package was, I think, bad for Mr. Musk. And it was, I am sure, bad for Tesla and, by extension, our nation's crucial fight against global warming, by far. Tesla is now asking its shareholders to reapprove this pay package, which would hand Mr. Musk an eye-popping roughly $ 46 billion. It would make him, the world's richest man, one of its highest-paid executives.
I have a recommendation for Tesla shareholders: Vote no.
The board promised Mr. Musk -- at his urging -- that if he made the board and the shareholders truly wealthy by boosting the stock price, by whatever means, he could have 12 percent of the company. Yet I believe this pay package helped drive his descent from visionary business leader to bizarre carnival barker. And that set of incentives and responses should not be validated.
Here I need to back up and tell you what meme stocks are. The standard example is GameStop, a company that runs about 4,000 video game and electronics stores. Trading at $ 5 a share at the start of December 2020, its price rose to a staggering roughly $ 150 a share at the end of January 2021. Mr. Musk joined the fun by tweeting one word -- "Gamestonk!!" -- and the shares soared to $ 483 two days later, before beginning a long, jagged decline. As of the start of 2024, it was almost $ 17 a share after a four-for-one stock split, far above the $ 5 of 2020, even though nothing much had changed about its (struggling) business. And a recent revival of GameStop mania has since pushed it up to $ 30 a share.
Who is behind all of this craziness? It is not people who want to invest in a slice of Gamestop's business over the long term. It is, rather, that people who are buying GameStop as a way of pledging allegiance to an idea, a meme, a cultural-technological movement of some kind -- and a few hoping to get rich by tagging along and selling at the top. Past stock manias and bubbles involved people who believed that the company involved would be profitable or at least that they would be able to make money selling their stock to a greater fool than them who had just arrived in the marketplace and still believed. But GameStop stock became all but disconnected from the profit-and-loss statements of the 4,000 GameStop stores.
And so it has become with Tesla. It was no longer about getting better at making high-quality electric vehicles for which there was strong demand. For Mr. Musk, incentivized by his pay package, it became about a stock price that must go up.
After 2018, Mr. Musk went all in. He made noise, particularly on Twitter. He still overpromised, but he no longer overdelivered; instead he jumped from moonshot theme to moonshot theme to boost the meme-stock association of Tesla. Humanoid robots! Cybertrucks! Fleets of Tesla robotaxis! An artificial intelligence supercomputer whose brain would be all the idle Teslas in the world, networked! And the share price did zoom, making him the richest man on earth, from about $ 20, give or take, around 2018 to over $ 400 in late 2021 before beginning a jagged and often interrupted decline to its still lofty $ 174.
Tesla had always had build-quality problems. But it used to have a road map for fixing them. And it used to have a road map for gaining manufacturing expertise, adding capacity, introducing models to crawl down from the rarefied technoexperiment and luxury car markets into the enormous market of providing what Americans see as their basic transportation. But those seem to have fallen away. The idea that there would soon be a truly affordable mass-market Tesla receded from "real soon" to "maybe someday." Instead we got the Cybertruck, for which demand is rather limited, as it is not set up to do the things that people who use pickup trucks need them for. And meanwhile, in China, BYD's blade-battery technologies and process-manufacturing expertise grew by leaps and bounds.
Unlike GameStop, Tesla sells products a bit more critical to our future than games like Call of Duty. For the world, Tesla has been nothing short of a beacon of hope, a carbon-transition technological spearhead to a more sustainable future with less damage from global warming, via a rapid build-out of electric vehicles and power. For our shared future, the world very badly needs to return to the Tesla before 2018, when it was showing how to design and efficiently build electric vehicles at a truly ferocious rate.
A management focused on the actual business Tesla is engaged in is far better for society than a management focused on what the pay package incentivizes Mr. Musk to focus on every hour he spends working on the company: continuing the run of Tesla as a meme stock.
John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1936, with characteristic British understatement, "When the capital development of a country becomes a byproduct of a casino, the job is likely to be ill done." Voting for the pay package would validate this focus, and that is a damned shame, for Elon Musk is truly consequential. And that is a big deal.
Or perhaps shareholders should vote for the pay package out of fear: If Mr. Musk regards himself as betrayed, he may no longer spend time talking up Tesla and its share price -- and without his meme stock mojo, the shares could falter. Toyota makes generally higher-quality cars and has revenue that in 2023 was more than four times Tesla's but commands only about three-fifths of its total market capitalization. That is how far down Tesla stock could go.
But I argue that we must accept the possibility of short-term pain for a forever payoff. Tesla almost certainly accounts for a plurality of Mr. Musk's fortune. SpaceX makes up the bulk of the remainder. And SpaceX appears to be in very good hands, as he trusts the awesomely competent Gwynne Shotwell, who, as chief operating officer of SpaceX, has managed the marriage of fire and ice, building an organizational culture that combines an astonishing attention to detail with a willingness to experiment beyond the limits of what had been thought possible. She proves that Mr. Musk is capable of far better business judgment. Business judgment that Tesla desperately needs. Right now.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The insurance industry, hungry for insights into how people drive, has turned to automakers and smartphone apps like Life360.
You know you have a credit score. Did you know that you might also have a driver score?
The score reflects the safety of your driving habits -- how often you slam on the brakes, speed, look at your phone or drive late at night.
While you can see your credit score, you will have a harder time finding out what your driving score is. But auto insurance companies can get it -- and that could affect the rate you pay.
For the last two decades, auto insurers have been trying to get people to enroll in programs, commonly called usage-based insurance plans, that monitor their day-to-day driving so rates better reflect the actual risk. But privacy-minded consumers have been reluctant to sign up.
So the industry has taken a different tack, getting data about how people drive from automakers or from apps that drivers already have on their phones. Experts say most people have no idea the insurance industry can track them this way.
After The New York Times revealed that General Motors was sharing driving behavior with LexisNexis, customers filed dozens of lawsuits and the carmaker ended its contract with the data broker. But data is still being collected from other automakers and it is still being collected from apps.
Driving behavior analysis, or telematics, as the insurance industry calls it, could be better for consumers, leading to personalized rates that are more fair. Plus, if people have to pay more for their risky driving, they may drive more cautiously, leading to safer roads. But this will happen only if drivers are aware that their behavior is being monitored.
According to the companies collecting and selling the data, consumers agree to share their information with the insurance industry. But the murky consent process means people may not realize what they are opting into.
"Most consumers are put off by the idea of an insurance company riding shotgun," said Michael DeLong of the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America.
Smartphone Apps
The smartphone apps collecting driver data may not be obvious at first glance. One, Life360, is used by parents to keep track of their children. MyRadar offers weather forecasts. GasBuddy helps people save on fuel costs.
All of these apps also have opt-in driving analysis features that rely on sensor and motion data from the phone. You can turn on these features to get notifications if a family member crashes or suggestions for a more fuel-efficient route to work. Those features, though, are provided by an analytics company, Arity, which was founded by Allstate in 2016 and pays for access to the data. What is not made clear when people sign up for the features is that Arity also analyzes how risky their driving is for insurance purposes.
On GasBuddy, for instance, users can turn on a feature that rates the fuel efficiency of their drives, a feature "powered by Arity." Brandon Logsdon, a spokesman for the company, said users "agree to Arity's privacy statement before they opt in to the Drives function."
But this agreement is in small gray font under a big red button labeled "Join Drives." The tiny disclosure says simply that by clicking "Join Drives" you will share "certain information" with Arity and agree to Arity's privacy statement, which is hyperlinked. The language does not explain what Arity is or does.
The company sells access to the driving scores of tens of millions of people. Auto insurance companies can "request a person's individual driving score, which is delivered instantly," according to Allstate's website.
The scores "look at drivers' performance behind the wheel, including how often they brake suddenly, speed or use their phones," according to an Arity blog post aimed at insurance marketers, and can be used to target potential customers based on "10 different risk categories."
Last month, Kathleen Lomax, a New Jersey mother who paid $ 100 annually for Life360 to track her husband and twin 18-year-old daughters, reached out to the company to ask if it was selling their driving data. An automated response, "crafted with the help of A.I.," told her that Life360 did share driving behavior data with Arity.
"No one who realizes what they're doing would consent," said Ms. Lomax, who canceled her subscription.
A spokeswoman for Life360 wrote in an email that "personally identifiable driving data," for Ms. Lomax and her family, were never shared with an insurance company, that a Life360 member must consent and that Arity was required to "take steps with its partners" to identify Life360 as data source when it was used to generate insurance quotes. In a statement, GasBuddy said Arity provides users "who choose to opt in with personalized offerings and enhanced services." MyRadar did not respond to requests for comment.
When a person shops around for auto insurance, the insurer needs to get consent to have access to the driving data collected by these apps, said Arity's spokeswoman, Stacy Silver. But how explicit is that request? A spokesman for CSAA, a regional insurer for AAA members that uses Arity's product in some states, said the consent to use smartphone data happened when it informed consumers that "we may collect third party data and reports." That is standard language that insurers use to view a credit report, for example, and many consumers may click past it without reading closely.
Companies that create consumer reports are required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act to provide them upon request. Not all of the millions of people in Arity's database can get their individual driving report, though; the company provides a report to a driver only if an insurance company has requested it as part of a quote.
Not all insurers are using Arity's driving data. Spokesmen for GEICO and USAA said they collected driving behavior only from people who downloaded a dedicated smartphone app to track how they drove.
Allstate said it planned to "soon offer consumers the choice to get a personalized rate based on their driving history," as collected by Arity.
A New Metric
Auto insurance pricing is complicated. A number of factors go into determining it, including credit history, gender, marital status, age, what car you drive and where you live, said Dale Porfilio of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group.
"We are trying to predict the future, which, of course, nobody can know with certainty," Mr. Porfilio said. "It's a core tenet of insurance that the price of the policy should reflect the risk of the policy."
He said the insurance industry had access to lots of data, and he described telematics, when drivers granted access to it, as "just one of the most recent variables that has come into play as a tool to align price to risk."
One reason it may be particularly appealing right now, Mr. Porfilio said, is that traffic citation data, which insurers have long relied on to predict risk, is not as reliable as it once was. Driving has gotten more dangerous, but the police are giving out fewer tickets, a decline that some attribute to a law enforcement pullback after the pandemic and widespread protests over George Floyd's death four years ago.
But the bigger appeal of telematics is that it could more accurately predict risk for individual drivers and be a fairer way to set rates. Most insurers will charge a 24-year-old man who lives in a busy city more than a 50-year-old woman who lives in the suburbs, an Arity promotional document states, but what if this particular man is a cautious driver who rarely uses his car while the woman is a road-rager who racks up the miles?
Alan Demers, founder of InsurTech Consulting, predicted that everyone would eventually have a driving score, and that good drivers -- which most people think they are -- might well prefer it.
"Don't judge me based on everyone else," Mr. Demers said. "Judge me based on me."
On this point, advocates for consumers agree with the industry.
"There's a lot of unfair discrimination in auto insurance," Mr. DeLong of the Consumer Federation of America said. "Auto insurance companies use a lot of socioeconomic factors, like your credit score or your job or your education level, like whether you went to high school or to college or whether you're married."
People with poor credit scores pay much more for auto insurance even if they have clean driving records, Mr. DeLong has found.
"Telematics has substantial promise for consumers, and it could be a way to better price auto insurance," he said. Still, he had concerns that insurance companies could become overly invasive or use data in ways that lead to new forms of discrimination.
What time of day someone drives, for example, can be tracked. Significant time spent driving at night hurts a person's score because of poorer visibility and drivers on the road who are more likely to be tired or inebriated. But that, Mr. DeLong pointed out, penalizes people who work the night shift and are more likely to be lower-income workers, such as janitors.
Mr. DeLong also objects to consumers' being "unknowingly or unwillingly enrolled in these programs."
Chi Chi Wu, a lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center, raised another concern: The law requires consumer reporting agencies such as Arity to make efforts to ensure that their data is accurate.
"They need to have procedures to figure out when the app is collecting data about you as the driver versus the passenger," she said.
Ms. Silver, Arity's spokeswoman, said Arity "uses advanced technology to determine if a person is driving or riding as a passenger."
Unexpected Monitoring
Last year, Rob Leathern, a tech executive in Texas, got a seemingly innocuous email from Toyota: "Good news, Robert! You've been identified by Toyota Insurance as a safe driver."
The email promised "big savings" from Progressive and invited him to get a quote for his 2023 Sequoia sport utility vehicle. When Mr. Leathern clicked the link in the email, it took him to a Toyota Insurance website that told him to enter his ZIP code and "get a quote." If he clicked the quote button, the website informed him, he would authorize a company called Connected Analytic Services to send his contact information, vehicle identification number and "certain vehicle driving data" to Progressive.
Mr. Leathern wanted to know what information was being collected about him. After a month of phone calls, emails and data privacy requests to Toyota and Connected Analytic Services -- which turned out to be an insurance data broker -- he got a report in January from Connected Analytic Services that detailed the previous six months of driving in his S.U.V. (Corey Proffitt, a Toyota spokesman, said that Connected Analytic Services is a Toyota affiliate that anonymously shares location and driving data with partner insurers, and that customers can manage what is shared about them in the data privacy portal of the Toyota/Lexus app.)
The report had two parts. A driving summary included Mr. Leathern's mileage, how many times his car's safety systems had been engaged and the number of times he had braked and accelerated at a rate "that insurers view as harder than necessary for defensive driving."
There was also a Microsoft Excel file with time-stamped lists of his every offending event and the latitude and longitude for where they occurred. In the speeding tab, for example, there were more than 200 second-by-second entries for the handful of drives during which Mr. Leathern had exceeded 85 miles per hour.
"I had no idea they'd be collecting this data, let alone using it this way," he said.
Ronald Davis, a spokesman for Progressive, said the insurer got identified driving data from a carmaker only when customers provided explicit consent to use that data to determine their rate.
In a presentation for investors in 2022, Progressive said data about how people drove was improving its pricing accuracy. It included a screen that a potential customer would see when seeking a quote. "Get a personalized rate based on your driving behavior," the screen read, with a yes-or-no option to "use my existing driving data."
"When quoting a new policy with Progressive, we specifically inform eligible customers that driving data is available from their vehicle manufacturer and ask them if they would like us to use that data in determining their rate," Mr. Davis said. He noted that 70 percent of people who had chosen to share their behavior had gotten a discount.
Driver, Beware
In April, Connecticut's insurance regulator issued a consumer alert warning that new cars may track people's driving and affect how much they pay for insurance.
George Bradner, an assistant deputy commissioner at the Connecticut Insurance Department, said his agency supported the use of telematics and the opportunity for people to be rated on how they drove.
But his agency issued the alert because many consumers aren't aware of the use of the data. He said insurance companies needed to be transparent and disclose the information they were using to rate people.
And consumers, he said, "need to be more vigilant about their protection of their privacy."
What You Can Do
Check the privacy settings on your car's dashboard system and in smartphone apps.
If an app connects to your car, or gives you feedback about your driving, that's a good place to start.
In some apps, such as Life360 and MyRadar, you can select this option: "Do not sell my personal information."
Two apps you don't have to worry about: Google Maps and Waze. Google, which owns both apps, said it doesn't provide driving data that's linked to individuals to third parties.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As an architect, Ivan Rupnik thinks the solution to America's affordable housing shortage is obvious: Build more houses. Start today. But the way homes are built in the United States makes speed impossible.
Years ago, Rupnik's Croatian grandmother, an architect herself, pointed him to an intriguing answer to this conundrum: modular housing projects built in Europe in the 1950s and '60s. Rupnik was awed. Sure, prefab complexes, and especially Soviet bloc housing, could be ugly and too homogenous, but the process created millions of housing units in a flash.
Hooked, Rupnik started researching modular housing for his doctoral dissertation. In the archives of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, he stumbled upon a reference in an old journal article that took him by surprise: an industrialized housing initiative called Operation Breakthrough that built nearly 3,000 units between 1971 and 1973 -- in the United States. How had he never heard about it?
It turned out few people had. Unable to find much more information, Rupnik turned to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which created the program. In 1969, when Operation Breakthrough was announced, HUD was less than four years old and affordable housing was still a bipartisan issue. The plan's visionary, HUD Secretary George Romney, a former Republican governor and Nixon appointee (and, yes, Mitt's father) pitched it as Economics 101: If you quickly increase the supply of housing, you drive down the price for all.
Romney said the country needed to build 26 million houses in 10 years, almost three times as many as had been built in the previous 10. Industrializing construction, he argued, was the only way to do it.
While nearly every other industry has become more productive since 1968, productivity in home-building -- the amount of work done by one worker in one hour, essentially -- has declined by half. The country is barely building enough to maintain the status quo, which is some four million units short of need, according to Freddie Mac. In the coming years, with population growth, climate change and the natural deterioration of housing stock, we'll only need more.
Housing shortages were already a problem in 1969. Romney understood that companies wouldn't invest in the machinery and overhead needed to industrialize because varied local building and zoning codes made it impossible to scale up. Operation Breakthrough proposed using the vast purchasing power of the federal government to guarantee a large market, and in the process, document and change the regulatory barriers to industrialization.
Operation Breakthrough selected nine sites around the country. Among its factory-built experiments was housing for the elderly in Kalamazoo, Mich., and owner-occupied co-ops on a lake in Macon, Ga. The program created public housing in Memphis and 58 townhouses in downtown Seattle for renters with housing vouchers. But in 1976, Congress decided that the program was too costly and that HUD shouldn't be doing demonstration projects. Less than a decade after it was announced, Operation Breakthrough was dead.
But as Rupnik pored over the record, he was struck by what the program had accomplished. It had led to a national code that regulated and greatly expanded the previously lawless trailer home sector, which now accounts for 10 percent of single-family homes. To Rupnik, the experiment demonstrated something powerful: When a uniform national building code was implemented, industry would respond. The barriers to building housing fast, in other words, weren't technological, but institutional.
While Operation Breakthrough made little impact in the United States, it radically influenced other countries. Japan sent a delegation to tour the Operation Breakthrough construction sites and to study its reports: Nearly all construction in Japan now is industrialized and 15 percent of homes are prefabricated in steel. In Sweden, 45 percent of construction is industrialized. Builders there also erect tall structures with wood, the preferred housing material in the United States, and the one that's most climate friendly.
After he got his doctorate, Rupnik co-founded a firm called MOD X that focuses on advancing industrialized construction. He couldn't shake the absurdity that in the United States, where Operation Breakthrough was tested, industrialized housing makes up just a 3 percent market share. So he and his MOD X co-directors got the Department of Housing and Urban Development to let them re-evaluate Operation Breakthrough with the goal of figuring out how to produce efficient industrialized housing in the United States.
In June 2023, I joined one of the firm's research trips. The team wanted to see what housing in the United States might be like if Congress hadn't canceled Operation Breakthrough. We flew to Sweden to find out.
How to Build a House Like a Volvo
The premise of Operation Breakthrough was essentially: What if we could build houses in the same way the automotive industry produces cars? Lindbäcks, a family-owned construction company in Sweden, just shy of the Arctic Circle, took that question literally. Before opening a housing factory in 2017, its management visited the factories of Toyota and Volvo as well as nearby pulp and paper plants, borrowing their best ideas.
The Lindbäcks factory now spans 10 acres, an aircraft hangar for the most earthbound of structures. On a foggy June day, Stefan Lindbäck, the fourth-generation chief executive of the company, gave a tour to our delegation. We put on safety boots before being led onto a metal walkway overlooking the vast factory floor. Humans moved around machines, like people on the track of a music box.
Everything in the factory was oriented around one main line -- a slow-moving conveyor belt on which finished components were assembled into fully formed modules. The main line was the spine. More time-consuming subassemblies -- shorter lines with machines building floors, walls, ceilings and so-called logistics, like countertops and cabinets -- fed into the spine like ribs. One boxy unit was completed every 30 minutes. The units could be connected to create apartments of different sizes and floor plans.
On one rib, an interior wall traveled onto a rack where it stood vertical for painting. This trick struck Mary Tingerthal, former commissioner of Minnesota Housing and now a special adviser to a modular company called RISE, as almost revolutionary. The little industrialized construction that happens in the United States tends to proceed down a single assembly line. Wet construction, like painting and staining, generally happens within a closed box and slows the progress. In this factory, she marveled, "It's constantly out in the air!"
But the most remarkable difference between the United States and Sweden is regulatory. Building codes in the U.S. try to make buildings safe by prescribing exactly what materials must be used and how (a prescriptive code). In Sweden, the government does this by setting goals and letting builders come up with a way to achieve them (a performance code).
So, for instance, U.S. building codes dictate the thickness of drywall that must be used for fire resistance, how many layers are needed and how many nails are required to attach it. In Sweden, the code requires that a wall must resist burning for two hours, say, and lets engineers and manufacturers figure out how to accomplish that. The regulator's job is to check the engineer's work.
The result of both is fire resistance and structural safety, but in the United States, each residential building needs to be granted a permit. During construction, work often halts for inspectors to make periodic visual inspections. That contributes to a stop-and-go pace that frustrates pretty much everybody except lenders, who get interest on financing. Sweden's codes require more work on the front end when builders have to demonstrate that their methods are up to snuff, but factory processes that comply with the performance code can be certified. This encourages innovative solutions and results in less waste.
Building quality homes, whether on-site or off-site, will never be cheap. You don't want to scrimp on materials or labor, and the savings of factory-built homes might not be obvious at the start, Lindbäck told our group. A conventional builder might bid lower than Lindbäcks, but then there are the costs of supervising the construction on-site and paying for delays in interest charges. And conventional builders profit from changes late in the process.
With factory-built houses, modifications are minimized because customers generally select from a standardized framework and changes are allowed only up to a certain point. The factory builder's advantage is quality control and speed. Real profit, long-term profit, comes from streamlining the building system for predictable outcomes and fast delivery.
"It's not about the cheapest product," Lindbäck said. "We want the cheapest solution."
An Alchemy of Design and Wood
As we rode on a bus about an hour and a half south of the Lindbäcks factory, sun flickered for miles through thin bars of pine and spruce outside the windows. Then the boreal forest parted onto a small city where one building towered above the rest: Sara Kulturhus, a cultural center topped by a hotel, a 20-story mass timber building, constructed with factory-made units. The hotel tower contains 205 identical rooms sheathed in double-pane windows, like cubbies sealed in glass.
Before Sweden adopted its performance-based code in 1995, wood buildings had been limited to two stories; almost overnight, wooden buildings could be as tall as engineers could prove safe.
Construction accounts for 40 percent of global carbon emissions, but in Sweden it's 20 percent because so much is built with the country's plentiful wood. Carbon is captured in the trees harvested and in the trees planted to replace them. While wood costs more than some other materials, building with it requires less energy and allows for faster construction. That means developers can both pay off construction loans and rent units sooner.
A wooden key card clicked me into a spruce hotel room with a floor-to-ceiling window. The boxiness felt more a function of minimalist Scandinavian design than volumetric modular construction. It was well past midnight, but at the end of June, the sun merely dipped below the horizon for a few hours, casting a dim glow, like a lamp from a room around the corner. More even than the light at this magical, crepuscular hour, the critical element of the room's alchemy of architecture and interior design was the soft, soothing wood.
Oskar Norelius, a partner at the firm White Arkitekter, which designed Sara Kulturhus and the hotel, told me that quality timber was expensive, so he economized by designing for industrial production. Hotels are perfect for this, as are dorms, offices and hospitals. "One module," he said, referring to the hotel room itself, "is large enough that you can fit everything into it: the bathroom, all the finishes, and it will still be quite easy to transport."
The volumetric modular units were assembled at Derome, a factory not dissimilar from Lindbäcks. They were then driven, 95 percent complete, to the site, where they were stacked by crane, as quickly as one 16-unit floor per week, depending on the wind. When units were bolted together, gaskets around their perimeters suctioned together, airtight. Hotel modules could be assembled off-site at the same time that the cultural center, the base of the hotel, was being built on-site. This parallel construction saved a year, according to the contractor.
Norelius walked us through the cultural center, which contains a public library, two art galleries and six theaters. As we passed through the monumental lobby into an open gallery space, Rupnik excitedly identified the standardized timber modules that had been designed for this project. The main entrance opened onto a staircase with seating for community readings and events. Above, a kinetic wooden chandelier opened and closed its wooden petals to reflect whether the building and its solar panels were adding or subtracting energy from the grid.
To Rupnik and others on the trip, the advantages of modular housing were obvious. But efforts to build this way in the U.S. have had difficulty flourishing.
The most famous U.S. off-site housing manufacturer is actually infamous: Katerra, founded in 2015, was the start-up that everyone believed would make the leap. It had oodles of money -- SoftBank invested $ 2.4 billion -- but it tried to do everything, everywhere, all at once. "They went on a very rapid growth acquisition," said Todd Beyreuther, the former senior director of advanced building materials at Katerra, who had come on the Sweden trip. A year into the pandemic, having splurged on state-of-the-art factories and acquisitions, the company imploded and filed for bankruptcy.
But Rupnik is excited about other initiatives across the country. A company in Philadelphia bought Katerra's factory in Tracy, Calif., and has completed more than 6,000 modules. In Vallejo, Calif., Factory OS has made housing for clients like Alphabet, Google's parent company, and Oakland developers. In Minneapolis, the Public Housing Authority commissioned RISE Modular to build 16 buildings around the city.
What may ultimately force the adoption of industrialized housing in the United States is a skilled labor shortage. This has already affected one area of home-building: roof trusses, the structural timber frameworks that support a roof. Trusses require precisely cutting angles, a skill few workers possess, and so the structures are now mostly made in factories.
Worker shortages are bound to get worse. The median age of a construction worker is 42,according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Traditional construction means working unpredictable hours in unpredictable elements and requires physical strength to climb and hoist materials on a job site. In a factory, those constraints don't necessarily apply. One data point: women make up less than 15 percent of U.S. construction workers; at Lindbäcks, more than 30 percent of the work force is female.
The controlled environment isn't just good for workers; it's also good for the product. Rupnik recalled watching a stack of timber sit on a job site in Boston all winter. It snowed, the snow melted into sooty slush, and the lumber soaked in a dirty puddle for weeks, compromising the construction quality.
The Need for Speed
No one seems to know exactly how many of the 3,000 units built by Operation Breakthrough still stand. Bryant Manor, the complex of 58 townhouses in downtown Seattle, is being torn down in stages without fanfare. In its place will be a building with 250 apartments, 58 of which will remain affordable.
On a recent Sunday, I dropped by. I approached one resident, Fatuma Hussein, as she was leaving the complex. Now a student at the University of Washington, she had grown up in Bryant Manor. "It's gated and the kids can play outdoors -- water balloon fights, soccer, everything you can think of," she said. "The elders walk the green space in the morning. I know every family."
She asked if I wanted a tour and led me inside. A toddler pressed her cheeks against a window with a doughy smile. As Hussein waved hello, two more smiling children appeared at the glass to greet us.
I followed Hussein into the townhouse where she lives with her mother and two sisters. We took off our shoes before entering. Hussein's corner unit was one of the smaller ones, and yet it was adequate for a family.
Hussein's mother, Asha Mohamed, a Somali refugee, stood in the galley kitchen, stirring a delicious Ethiopian lamb stew, a recipe she learned from neighbors at a community center event. She was cooking for a former neighbor who had lived in one of the units that had been razed. The former neighbor was lonely since relocating temporarily and her Bryant Manor friends were surprising her with a potluck.
The unit was old, and there was a water stain on the kitchen ceiling. The bedrooms were small. But there were two full bathrooms. I could not tell that the home was factory-built. What I could tell was that it was loved and well-cared-for by its occupants. And most important, Mohamed, who worked at a nearby day care, could afford the place on a housing voucher.
Whenever I talked to Rupnik, he was more interested in the productivity part of the industrialized housing equation than the affordability part. This had confused me. But after spending time in Sweden talking to modular manufacturers, architects, government officials and leaders in the timber industry, I started to see the connection. Productivity means more permanent homes for more people, faster. Speed secures perhaps the greatest long-term savings -- preventing the trauma of homelessness and offering security, community, continuous enrollment at the same school. It had been lulling to see the beautiful Swedish modular housing, but America is where I saw the real potential of even imperfectly designed modular housing.
Speed is how industrialization achieves affordability. Even when the labor and material cost savings are modest, the introduction of many more units in a relatively short period of time has the effect of lowering the market price of all units. That was Operation Breakthrough's objective and MOD X's main takeaway.
Rupnik is finishing his report for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and preparing for the next phase of MOD X's HUD research, which involves dissecting the regulatory barriers to off-site construction in six pilot regions. He has been struck by how well the theories underpinning Operation Breakthrough have held up. It also frustrates him. Had attention been paid 50 years ago, housing in the United States might look very different today. Maybe architects would be designing more beautiful factory-built housing. Maybe prescriptive codes that stifle innovation would have been ameliorated. Maybe, Rupnik says, affordable housing would not be so hard to come by. House-building as it's done now limits the range of what builders are willing to produce: Lower-priced housing isn't as profitable and so, lower-income people suffer.
The only way to move forward, Rupnik believes, is to return to the ambition of Operation Breakthrough and unleash the power of industrialization. As he told me: "We really have run out of alternatives."

Japan Carmakers Admit To Fumbling Safety Tests: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Japanese authorities had told the companies to conduct investigations into their compliance with national standards for safety and other issues.
Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and other top Japanese automakers said on Monday that internal investigations found they had mishandled vehicle testing on dozens of models over the past decade.
Toyota said it had failed to gather proper data when doing pedestrian and occupant safety tests for three models, including its popular Yaris Cross sport utility vehicle. Honda and Mazda Motor said they, too, had identified problems related to the testing of several models.
The automakers, which the Japanese government had told to open the investigations, said the testing failures would not affect the performance or safety of their vehicles and that customers could continue to use them normally. Still, Toyota said it would temporarily halt shipments of three of the affected models it produces in Japan. Mazda said it would suspend sales of two Japan models.
The testing problems revealed Monday by Toyota, Honda and Mazda were conducted in Japan to meet the Japanese government's certification standards. The vehicles at issue were sold in Japan.
Suzuki Motor and Yamaha Motor also said on Monday that they had found inadequate testing in the past.
The disclosures from Toyota and others add to a lengthening tally of testing and certification problems that Japanese automakers have faced in recent months -- issues that people in the industry worry could affect consumer perceptions of the quality of Japanese cars.
In December, an internal investigation at a Toyota subsidiary, Daihatsu Motor, revealed that most of its vehicles had not undergone proper collision-safety testing. The next month, another Toyota unit suspended all of its engine shipments after an investigation revealed that it had falsified figures concerning engine power.
Japan's transport ministry responded in January by instructing 85 companies, including car and component makers, to look into any problems that could have occurred during their testing processes.
"Given that vehicle safety and performance isn't impacted, this latest revelation isn't hugely critical for the companies involved," said Satoru Aoyama, a senior director at Fitch Ratings.
But, Mr. Aoyama said, "there has long been a perception of the superior manufacturing and quality of Japanese products and with these instances of fraud appearing again and again, perceptions may be beginning to change."
In addition to the problems Toyota found involving three current models, it discovered errors in crash tests and other tests for four models it had discontinued.
In response to the earlier revelations of data falsification and testing problems at Toyota and affiliated companies, Toyota's chairman, Akio Toyoda, had said he would take responsibility for turning the group around.
In a briefing on Monday, Mr. Toyoda bowed and apologized to customers.
"These acts shake the very foundation of the verification system," he said. "They should have never been committed."
Mr. Toyoda said he was working with Toyota group companies to identify problems with internal certification processes and work structures, and had made several trips to visit their work sites himself. "We will carry out concrete improvements," he said.
Japan's transport ministry said it would conduct an inspection at Toyota headquarters on Tuesday to follow up on the latest disclosures.

As Electric Vehicles Get Cheaper, Buyers Are No Longer Just Elites: [National Desk]

Full text: More efficient manufacturing, falling battery costs and intense competition are lowering sticker prices for battery-powered models to within striking distance of gasoline cars.
Alex Lawrence, a dealer in Salt Lake City who specializes in used electric cars, has seen a change over the last year in the kinds of customers who are coming into his showroom. They used to be well-heeled professionals who could drop $ 70,000 on a Rivian luxury pickup truck.
Recently, Mr. Lawrence said, customers have been snapping up used Teslas for a little over $ 20,000, after applying a $ 4,000 federal tax credit.
"We're seeing younger people," Mr. Lawrence said. "We are seeing more blue-collar and entry-level white-collar people. The purchase price of the car has suddenly become in reach."
Regarded by conservative politicians and other critics as playthings of the liberal elite, electric vehicles are fast becoming more accessible. Prices are falling because of increased competition, lower raw-material costs and more efficient manufacturing. Federal tax credits of up to $ 7,500 for new electric cars, often augmented by thousands of dollars in state incentives, push prices even lower.
At the same time, technology is improving quickly and making electric vehicles more practical. Cars that can travel more than 300 miles on a fully charged battery are becoming common, and charging times are dropping below 30 minutes. The number of fast chargers, which can top up a battery in less than half an hour, grew 36 percent from April 2023 to April 2024.
Carmakers including Tesla, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the owner of Jeep, have announced plans for electric vehicles that would sell new for as little as $ 25,000.
"The E.V. market has hit an inflection point," said Randy Parker, chief executive of Hyundai Motor America, which will begin producing electric vehicles at a factory in Georgia by the end of the year. "The early adopters have come. They've got their cars. Now you're starting to see us transition to a mass market."
All this is good news for proponents of electric vehicles and the Biden administration, which is aiming for half of new cars sold to be electric by 2030 as part of the president's plan to combat climate change. Even if Republicans gain control of the White House and Congress and follow through on promises to dismantle electric vehicle subsidies, they may not be able to undo the market forces pushing down prices.
"There may be some hiccups in the exact pace and scale of E.V. sales if there are major policy changes, but I wouldn't expect the E.V. market to flatline," said Peter Slowik, who leads research on passenger cars at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization. "Most automakers are committed to an all-electric future, and many are planning on a timeline that goes far beyond the next administration."
Electric cars, sales of which have slowed in recent months, are still more expensive than gasoline models, costing an average of $ 55,252 in the United States in April, according to estimates by Kelley Blue Book. That is a decline of 9 percent from April 2023, but still about $ 6,700 more than the average for all vehicles.
But Mr. Slowik's group estimates that cars and sport-utility vehicles capable of traveling 400 miles on a full battery will cost less than cars with internal combustion engines in 2030, even before taking into account government subsidies. (Pickup trucks, which require bigger batteries, will take a little longer, not reaching parity for 400-mile models until 2033.)
Those calculations do not take into account lower fuel and maintenance costs that strengthen the financial argument for electric vehicles. Electricity is almost always cheaper per mile than gasoline, and battery-powered vehicles don't need oil changes, engine air filters or spark plugs. For people who drive a lot, electric cars may already be a better deal. At the same time, some automakers are offering strong discounts on E.V. models as an enticement for buyers.
While prices are clearly trending downward, there are risks. China supplies more than half of the lithium-ion batteries used in cars sold in the United States, according to Interact Analysis, a research firm. Those batteries will become more expensive because the Biden administration announced in May that it would raise tariffs on them to 25 percent from 7.5 percent.
Many companies are building battery factories in the United States and Canada, but most of these won't produce enough batteries to replace China for several years.
Raw materials are another risk. The price of lithium and other materials required for batteries has plunged in the last 12 months, making electric cars cheaper. But commodity prices could soar again.
The recent slowdown in the growth of electric car sales has prompted Tesla, Ford and others to delay plans to expand manufacturing. But many analysts expect sales to pick up as a glut of models pushes down prices, and as the charging network grows. High prices and the fear of not being able to find a place to recharge are the two biggest reasons people hesitate to buy an electric vehicle, surveys show.
For many people, the car's price is not the only expense to consider. People who live in apartments often depend on public charging plugs. Public charging, besides being less convenient, tends to be more costly than charging at home.
Still, the forces pushing prices down are powerful. Manufacturing costs are dropping as traditional carmakers, who were slow to sell electric vehicles, start to apply their decades of experience with mass production to the new technology.
Later this year, for example, General Motors will begin selling an electric version of its Chevrolet Equinox sport-utility vehicle that will have a range of more than 300 miles and sell for less than $ 30,000 after the $ 7,500 federal tax credit. And the company plans to sell an even cheaper car, a new Chevrolet Bolt, next year.
The Equinox and Bolt will be built on G.M.'s Ultium platform, a collection of components that can be used for a variety of vehicles including pickups and luxury Cadillacs. G.M., which has cut costs by using the same batteries and parts for different models, has said its electric vehicles will become profitable in the second half of this year.
Electric cars still cost more to manufacture than cars with internal combustion engines, said Prateek Biswas, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a research firm. But costs will come down as companies learn how to produce the cars more efficiently, Mr. Biswas said -- for example, by eliminating rare minerals from electric motors or replacing copper wiring with aluminum.
At the same time, the cost to make a gasoline car is rising because of stricter emissions regulations. "At some point it will be easier to just move toward E.V.s," Mr. Biswas said.
Competition is also intensifying. Toyota and other Japanese carmakers with a reputation for delivering reliable and affordable vehicles are belatedly offering electric vehicles. Honda plans to begin producing them at an Ohio factory next year.
There will be more than 100 fully electric models for sale in the United States by next year, according to Cars.com, an online sales platform, double the number available last year. "We're at the point now where anybody that wants an E.V. for a price point can actually get an E.V.," said Rebecca Lindland, senior director of industry data at Cars Commerce, which operates Cars.com.
Used car prices are arguably more important than prices of new cars. Most people buy used cars. A vibrant used market vastly increases the number of people who can consider an electric vehicle.
Models from Tesla, Nissan or G.M. have been on the road for three years or more, generating inventory for dealers as the original owners buy new ones. More than half of the used electric vehicles on the market sell for less than $ 30,000, according to Recurrent, a research firm that focuses on the used E.V. market.
Jesse Lore, owner of Green Wave Electric Vehicles in North Hampton, N.H., recently sold a used Chevy Bolt for $ 15,000. After applying a federal tax credit for used electric vehicles, the price was $ 11,000. Besides the lure of affordable prices, he noted, his customers like that electric vehicles are quieter than gasoline models, better for the environment, and faster because an electric motor generates instant torque.
"The car is more fun than whatever they're driving now," Mr. Lore said.

Auto Deals Are Making A Comeback: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Automakers and dealers are starting to offer discounts, low-interest loans and other incentives to lure buyers as the supply of cars grows.
For much of the last four years, automakers and their dealers had so few cars to sell -- and demand was so strong -- that they could command high prices. Those days are over, and hefty discounts are starting a comeback.
During the coronavirus pandemic, auto production was slowed first by factory closings and then by a global shortage of computer chips and other parts that lasted for years.
With few vehicles in showrooms, automakers and dealers were able to scrap most sales incentives, leaving consumers to pay full price. Some dealers added thousands of dollars to the manufacturer's suggested retail price, and people started buying and flipping in-demand cars for a profit.
But with chip supplies back to healthy levels, auto production has rebounded and dealer inventories are growing. At the same time, higher interest rates have dampened demand for vehicles. As a result, many automakers are scrambling to keep sales rolling.
Wes Lutz, owner of Extreme Dodge in Jackson, Mich., said he had several Dodge Challengers and Chargers that were eligible for $ 11,000 discounts from Stellantis, the manufacturer of Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep and Ram models. The automaker is also offering discounts of up to $ 3,600 on certain versions of the Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle.
"It seems like we may be headed back toward incentives and overproduction," Mr. Lutz said. "It's not there yet, but it's getting close."
With a shrug, he added, "It may not be good for me or for the manufacturer, but it's sure good for the consumer."
Cash-back offers, subsidized loans and other incentives are important tools for selling cars. They allow automakers and dealers to offer monthly payments that are more affordable for consumers and ease the impact of high interest rates.
In the last few years, shortages and consumers' preferences for large vehicle have pushed the average purchase price of new vehicles to just under $ 47,000, and the average monthly payment to $ 735, according to Edmunds, a market researcher. The average interest rate on used car loans was 11.6 percent in April, according to Edmunds.
At those levels, many consumers can no longer afford cars without substantial incentives.
But when taken to extremes, incentives can erode automakers' profits and create a surge of sales that inevitably gives way to a painful drop. Repeated waves of discounting also condition consumers to purchase cars only when offered a deal.
Two decades ago, the industry went on an incentive binge. General Motors for a time sold cars at the heavily discounted prices it previously offered only to its employees. Extreme discounting helped weaken G.M. and Chrysler before they filed for bankruptcy in 2009 during the financial crisis.
For now, the industry has avoided that trap. At the end of May, automakers had almost 2.9 million cars and light trucks in stock, about one million more than at the same time last year, according to Cox Automotive, a market researcher. Nearly 7 percent of those vehicles were 2023 models. By comparison, there were 4.1 million vehicles in stock in 2019, according to Automotive News.
Toyota, Honda, Subaru, and G.M.'s Chevrolet and Cadillac brands have kept tight reins on their inventories and in general have not yet elevated incentives significantly.
But Ford, Lincoln, Dodge, Chrysler, Nissan, Volvo and several other brands have higher stocks -- enough to last more than 100 days at the current rate of sales. They're offering some big incentives, but mostly targeted at specific models, and sometimes specific versions of certain models.
Ford, for example, is offering $ 5,500 off its Escape S.U.V., but only on the 2023 models that remain in dealer stock. Stellantis is offering $ 4,000 cash back on the Ram pickup, but it is limited to the 1500 Classic version. Volkswagen is offering interest-free financing on the 2024 Taos small S.U.V., but not on its other models.
"So far we're not seeing the across-the-board incentives that we had in the past," said Charles Chesbrough, a senior economist at Cox Automotive.
The growing number of incentives on new vehicles has helped pull down prices of used cars and trucks. In April, used car prices declined nearly 7 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Among the most heavily discounted models at the moment are electric vehicles, sales of which have slowed in recent months. Consumers' enthusiasm for those models has ebbed, mainly over concerns about the higher prices of electric vehicles and the challenges of keeping them charged, especially on road trips.
Now automakers are offering generous incentives to entice consumers. Volkswagen is offering discounts of up to $ 18,750 on leases on the 2023 ID.4, which is still readily available in some places. That includes the $ 7,500 federal tax credit, which can be rolled into leasing deals under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Other considerable deals are available on the Chevrolet Blazer electric vehicle, the Cadillac Lyriq, the Kia EV6, the Volvo XC40 Recharge hybrid and the Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup. Tesla, which regularly raised prices during the pandemic, has spent the last year and a half slashing them. Recently the company has been offering 0.99 percent loans on its Model Y S.U.V.
The incentives come on top of other trends that are helping reduce the price of electric vehicles, including falling manufacturing costs and rising competition.
Increased discounting is helping tempt what are known in the industry as "want buyers" -- consumers who don't need a new car but are drawn by new technologies, design or features.
"You have your 'need buyer,' whose car had died or needs a lot of expensive repairs, and they have to get a new vehicle," said Adam Silverleib, owner of a Honda and a Volkswagen dealerships outside Boston. "But a lot of those 'want buyers' went away when interest rates went up, and now incentives are bringing some of them back."
Among them is Brian Pawlowski, a digital marketing executive in Chelsea, Mich. He had been driving a 2017 Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid that had only 55,000 miles on the odometer. But he was itching to get a fully electric model.
"I'm a person who likes the environment," he said. "I could have kept the Volt, but I wanted to upgrade to newer technology."
He began looking for deals on electric cars and found a two-year lease on a Hyundai Ioniq 5 S.U.V. The deal came with a $ 13,000 discount and other terms that left him with a monthly payment of $ 369 for a vehicle with a sticker price of $ 52,000.
"When the sales guy laid it all out," Mr. Pawlowski said, "it was pretty hard to pass up."

Electric Cars Are Suddenly Becoming Affordable

Alex Lawrence, a dealer in Salt Lake City who specializes in used electric vehicles, has seen a change over the past year in the kinds of customers who are coming into his showroom. They used to be well-heeled professionals who could drop $70,000 on a Rivian luxury pickup truck.
Recently, Lawrence said, customers have been snapping up used Teslas for a little more than $20,000, after applying a $4,000 federal tax credit.
“We’re seeing younger people,” Lawrence said. “We are seeing more blue-collar and entry-level white-collar people. The purchase price of the car has suddenly become in reach.”
Regarded by conservative politicians and other critics as playthings of the liberal elite, EVs are fast becoming more accessible. Prices are falling because of increased competition, lower raw-material costs and more efficient manufacturing. Federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs, often augmented by thousands of dollars in state incentives, push prices even lower.
At the same time, technology is improving quickly and making EVs more practical. Cars that can travel more than 300 miles on a fully charged battery are becoming common, and charging times are dropping below 30 minutes. The number of fast chargers, which can top up a battery in less than half an hour, grew 36% from April 2023 to this past April.
Carmakers including Tesla, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, owner of Jeep, have announced plans for EVs that would sell new for as little as $25,000.
“The EV market has hit an inflection point,” said Randy Parker, CEO of Hyundai Motor America, which will begin producing EVs at a factory in Georgia by the end of the year. “The early adopters have come. They’ve got their cars. Now you’re starting to see us transition to a mass market.”
All of this is good news for proponents of EVs and the Biden administration, which is aiming for half of new cars sold to be electric by 2030 as part of the president’s plan to combat climate change. Even if Republicans gain control of the White House and Congress and follow through on promises to dismantle EV subsidies, they may not be able to undo the market forces pushing down prices.
“There may be some hiccups in the exact pace and scale of EV sales if there are major policy changes, but I wouldn’t expect the EV market to flatline,” said Peter Slowik, who leads research on passenger cars at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization. “Most automakers are committed to an all-electric future, and many are planning on a timeline that goes far beyond the next administration.”
EVs, sales of which have slowed in recent months, are still more expensive than gasoline models, costing an average of $55,252 in the United States in April, according to estimates by Kelley Blue Book. That is a decline of 9% from April 2023 but still about $6,700 more than the average for all vehicles.
But Slowik’s group estimates that cars and SUVs capable of traveling 400 miles on a full battery will cost less than cars with internal combustion engines in 2030, even before taking into account government subsidies. (Pickup trucks, which require bigger batteries, will take a little longer, not reaching parity for 400-mile models until 2033.)
Those calculations do not take into account lower fuel and maintenance costs that strengthen the financial argument for EVs. Electricity is almost always cheaper per mile than gasoline, and battery-powered vehicles don’t need oil changes, engine air filters or spark plugs. For people who drive a lot, EVs may already be a better deal. At the same time, some automakers are offering strong discounts on EV models as an enticement for buyers.
Although prices are clearly trending downward, there are risks. China supplies more than half of the lithium-ion batteries used in cars sold in the United States, according to Interact Analysis, a research firm. Those batteries will become more expensive because the Biden administration announced in May that it would raise tariffs on them to 25% from 7.5%.
Many companies are building battery factories in the United States and Canada, but most of these won’t produce enough batteries to replace China for several years.
Raw materials are another risk. The price of lithium and other materials required for batteries has plunged in the past 12 months, making EVs cheaper. But commodity prices could soar again.

New Home Sales Fall, Indicating Cooling Market
Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell more than expected in April amid a resurgence in mortgage rates and higher prices, further evidence that the housing market was losing momentum in the second quarter.
New home sales dropped 4.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 634,000 units last month, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said on Thursday. The sales pace for March was revised lower to 665,000 units from the previously reported 693,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for more than 10 percent of U.S. home sales, would fall to a rate of 679,000 units. Sales plunged 20.9 percent in the Northeast and 7.3 percent in the West. They fell 4.8 percent in the densely populated South but increased 10.0 percent in the Midwest.
New home sales are a leading indicator of the housing market.

Ralph Lauren Revenues Come in Below Estimates
Ralph Lauren on Thursday forecast annual revenue growth below market expectations despite beating quarterly results, as it grapples with subdued U.S. demand.
The company also named insider Justin Picicci as its new chief financial officer, replacing Jane Nielsen, who will continue as Ralph's operations head.
The apparel maker's shares reversed course to rise 2 percent in morning trade as the company forecast strong margins for the year. The stock fell as much as 3 percent before the bell.
Ralph Lauren expects annual gross margin to rise up to 100 basis points, as lower cotton costs and full price sales offset pressures from labor and freight costs related to Red Sea disruptions.
"Ralph Lauren has a history of issuing conservative guidance. The margin improvement is more important than the sales growth," said David Swartz, analyst at Morningstar Research. REUTERS

20 Million Goal Omitted In Lastest Tesla Report
Tesla has left out its goal of delivering 20 million vehicles a year by 2030 in its latest impact report published on Thursday, another sign the company was moving away from electric cars as it shifts focus to robotaxis.
Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, had said in 2020 that the company aspired to sell 20 million vehicles by the end of the current decade -- twice as many as those sold by Toyota, the world's largest automaker. It had reiterated the goal in its 2021 and 2022 impact reports.
But the company has changed tack recently, dropping plans to produce an all-new model that was expected to cost $ 25,000, while touting autonomous driving technology as its main growth driver. It plans to host a launch event for its robotaxi on Aug. 8.
Robotaxis and the humanoid robot Optimus will be "incredibly profound" for Tesla, Musk said on Thursday at the "Viva Technology" conference in Paris. REUTERS

Full text: How the United States backed kidnapping, torture and murder in Afghanistan.
The convoy rumbled into the Taliban heartland, a white desert littered with stones. Over the loudspeakers at the local mosque, the Afghan police officers ordered everyone to gather: The commander was here.
Dozens assembled in the mud square to listen as Abdul Raziq, one of America's most important partners in the war against the Taliban, stood before the crowd, gesturing at two prisoners he had brought along to make his point.
The prisoners knelt with their hands bound as Raziq spoke to his men. A pair of his officers raised their rifles and opened fire, sending the prisoners into spasms on the reddening earth. In the silence that followed, Raziq addressed the crowd, three witnesses said.
"You will learn to respect me and reject the Taliban," Raziq said after the killings, which took place in the winter of 2010, according to the witnesses and relatives of both men. "Because I will come back and do this again and again, and no one is going to stop me."
For years, American military leaders lionized Raziq as a model partner in Afghanistan, their "if only" ally in the battle against the Taliban: If only everyone fought like Raziq, we might actually win this war, American commanders often said.
He ruled over the crucial battleground of Kandahar during a period when the United States had more troops on the ground than in any other chapter of the war, ultimately rising to lieutenant general thanks to the backing of the United States. American generals cycling through Afghanistan made regular pilgrimages to visit him, praising his courage, his ferocious war fighting and the loyalty he commanded from his men, who were trained, armed and paid by the United States and its allies.
The Americans were by his side until the very end. When he was gunned down by an undercover Taliban assassin in 2018, he was walking next to the top American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin S. Miller, who celebrated him as a "great friend" and "patriot."
But to countless Afghan civilians under his reign, Raziq was something else entirely: America's monster.
His battlefield prowess was built on years of torture, extrajudicial killings and the largest-known campaign of forced disappearances during America's 20-year war in Afghanistan, a New York Times investigation into thousands of cases during his rule found.
The Times obtained hundreds of pages of documents written by the former American-backed government, more than a decade's worth of hidden ledgers bearing clues to his campaign of abuse. He transformed the police into a fearsome combat force without constraints, and his officers abducted hundreds, if not thousands, of people to be killed or tortured in secret jails, The Times found. Most were never seen again.
The culture of lawlessness and impunity he created flew in the face of endless promises by American presidents, generals and ambassadors to uphold human rights and build a better Afghanistan.
And it helps explain why the United States lost the war.
For nearly two decades, the American public saw only part of the war in Afghanistan. Large parts of the country and its people were off limits to outsiders, impossible to chronicle fully during the fighting. Now that it's over, the Taliban are no longer planting roadside bombs, and many have swapped their AK-47s for three-ring binders and a stifling bureaucracy.
The Times spent more than a year visiting parts of Afghanistan that were once active battlefields, trying to figure out what really happened during America's longest war.
We interviewed many hundreds of people who said their fathers, husbands, sons and brothers had disappeared under Raziq, the police chief responsible for security across Kandahar Province, the birthplace of the Taliban. They saw his rule as little more than a brutal campaign against civilians, underwritten by the United States.
His acts not only discredited the American war effort -- breeding profound resentment that pushed people to support the Taliban -- but embodied it in many ways as well. Across Afghanistan, the United States elevated and empowered warlords, corrupt politicians and outright criminals to prosecute a war of military expediency in which the ends often justified the means.
The Taliban committed countless atrocities of their own against civilians, including suicide attacks, assassinations and kidnappings for ransom.
But it was a mistake to "keep a really bad criminal because he was helpful in fighting worse criminals," said Gen. John R. Allen, who said he tried to limit cooperation with Raziq when he was overseeing coalition forces in the Afghan war from 2011 to 2013.
While Raziq's tactics worked in some respects, beating back the Taliban in Kandahar and earning him the admiration of many who opposed them, the strategy came at a clear cost. It stirred such enmity in parts of the population that the Taliban turned his cruelty into a recruiting tool, broadcasting it to attract new fighters. Many Afghans came to revile the American-backed government and everything it represented.
"None of us supported the Taliban, at least not at first," said Fazul Rahman, whose brother was abducted in front of witnesses during Raziq's reign. "But when the government collapsed, I ran through the streets, rejoicing."
Even some who cheered the ruthlessness Raziq wielded against his enemies lamented the broader corruption and criminality he helped enshrine, a key part of why the Afghan government collapsed in 2021. After his death, his commanders expanded their predation further, extorting ordinary people and stealing from their own men's wages and supplies.
"What they brought under the name of democracy was a system in the hands of a few mafia groups," said Qari Mohammad Mubarak, who ran a girls' school in Kandahar and initially supported the government. "The people came to hate democracy."
Many American commanders, diplomats and their allies in Afghanistan knew at the time they were bankrolling a war that strayed far outside international law.
"Sometimes we asked Raziq about incidents of alleged human rights abuses, and when we got answers we would be like, 'Whoa, I hope we didn't implicate ourselves in a war crime just by hearing about it,"' said Henry Ensher, a State Department official who held multiple posts on Afghanistan, including as the top civilian representative in Kandahar in 2010 and 2011, when he worked with Raziq.
"We knew what we were doing, but we didn't think we had a choice," Ensher said.
Most American leaders -- including more than a dozen interviewed by The Times -- said that Raziq had been seen as the only partner capable of beating back the Taliban in the heartland of the insurgency, where a pitched battle for dominance was underway.
"In the moment, we might have succeeded, but so what?" Ensher said. "The entire enterprise was flawed."
Many Afghans say Raziq used the Americans and their military might to pursue a personal vendetta, taking vengeance against the rivals his tribe had been fighting for decades.
In interviews, many former senior American officials acknowledged that they never grasped that dynamic. It was a defining characteristic over a generation of combat -- how little the United States understood about the war it was waging.
The United Nations, human rights groups and news outlets raised serious concerns about Raziq and his forces, but independent investigations were limited, especially with the region so impenetrable during the war.
To determine the extent of the abuses, The Times combed through more than 50,000 handwritten complaints that had been scrawled into the Kandahar governor's ledgers from 2011 through the end of the war in 2021. In them, we found the rudimentary details of almost 2,200 cases of suspected disappearances.
From there, we went to hundreds of homes across Kandahar and tracked down nearly 1,000 people who said their loved ones had disappeared, been killed or been taken by government security forces.
All together, The Times collected detailed evidence of 368 cases of forced disappearances and dozens of extrajudicial killings attributed to American-backed forces in Kandahar. We counted only cases that were corroborated by at least two people, many of them eyewitnesses to the abductions, and they were often documented with police reports, affidavits and other government records as well.
In all of the cases of forced disappearances, the person is still missing.
These figures are almost certainly a gross undercount of the atrocities during Raziq's reign. We could not canvas all of Kandahar, home to more than a million people. And the more than 2,000 suspected cases we found in the government's ledgers were most likely just an inkling of what really happened. Most of the families we interviewed had never formally reported their loved ones missing, out of fear of retribution or the danger of traveling during the war.
Beyond that, the police destroyed many of their records as the Taliban reached the outskirts of Kandahar City in 2021, former senior officials said. The exact number who were abducted and never seen again may be impossible to know.
What is clear, however, is who was responsible: Only the American-backed government consistently engaged in forced disappearances in Kandahar, former officials, combatants and families of the victims said.
"The Taliban didn't need to disappear people -- they just killed them where they found them," said Hasti Mohammad, a former government official in charge of the Panjwai district in Kandahar. "The government disappeared people because what they were doing was illegal. They were hiding from the law."
The cases confirmed by The Times amount to the largest campaign of forced disappearances in Afghanistan since tens of thousands went missing after the Soviet-backed communist coup in 1978, an assessment of previous atrocities shows.
As the victims mourned their loved ones, they confronted their own powerlessness. Raziq was untouchable, thanks to the ironclad support of the United States and its NATO allies.
"We would ask ourselves: 'Are we creating something here that we may regret later?"' said Col. Robert Waltemeyer, a former Special Forces officer who worked with Raziq.
But there was no one better at fighting the Taliban, he said, adding that he never witnessed Raziq do anything illegal. When the United States sent tens of thousands of American soldiers to Afghanistan during the so-called surge announced in 2009, hoping to wrest control of the south, Raziq was central to the effort.
"He was probably the most important person in the entire surge," Waltemeyer said.
The United States pushed for Raziq to lead the police forces who fought alongside American troops, he said, because "he showed up, and his troops showed up, to fight, not just to watch the Americans fight."
In effect, Waltemeyer said, "We created Raziq."
"You look at every U.S. war and it's the same," he said. "We create regrets."
'Abdul Raziq's work'
Fazul Rahman raced to the grease-stained motorcycle shop the moment he got the call: His brother, a mechanic, had just been kidnapped.
In a panic, the shop workers told him that three men in civilian clothes had pulled up in an unmarked Toyota Corolla on the morning of Sept. 3, 2016, asking his brother to take a look at a generator in the trunk.
Then, in full view of a crowd of onlookers, they said, the men wrestled Fazul's brother, Ahmad, 28, into the car and sped away.
To Fazul and everyone else present, the culprits were obvious: the police. Under Raziq, Kandahar's security forces had become notorious for snatching anyone they suspected of working with Taliban insurgents. Many simply disappeared. Others turned up as mutilated corpses, discarded in the streets. A lucky few were released alive, bearing wounds and accounts of torture.
Some of the missing were, in fact, Taliban, their families said. Others, their relatives insisted, were not. Many were simply part of the working class: mechanics, tailors and taxi drivers who had nothing to do with the war, their families said.
Desperate to find his brother, Fazul gathered elders and hurried to the local police station. The officers denied arresting his brother, so he headed to the palace of the American-backed governor, joining the line to submit complaints.
The handwritten government ledgers reviewed by The Times show his plea: Volume 4 from 2016, Entry No. 591 -- Ahmad, son of Abdur Rahman.
There were thousands of families just like his, all with the same burning question. What had the government done with their loved ones?
After filing his complaint, Fazul worried. What would happen if he pushed too hard? The police were abducting and disappearing people on mere suspicions, never mind someone openly accusing them of kidnapping.
"The police were getting angry," he said. "They'd beat us and say, 'Why do you keep coming?"'
Still, another force, more potent than fear, was driving him: his mother, Malika.
Women were rarely seen or heard making public demands in conservative Afghanistan, especially in the south. But Fazul and Ahmad were all their mother had; their father had died of cancer more than 20 years earlier, leaving her to raise them on her own.
"For months, from morning to night, I went from the police to the governor's offices and waited for someone to see me," she said.
Outside the offices, scribes charged a small fee to write out complaints for people who, like Fazul and his mother, were illiterate. Many of the petitions were in Malika's name, and the family provided copies of them to The Times.
"Please help find and release my innocent son," one said. It carried the signatures of 11 local elders, all attesting that her son was not in the Taliban.
Soon, Fazul and his mother got to know other families searching for missing people. Having a relative arrested on suspicion of being an insurgent tarred them with the same brush. But the presence of women gave them some license to make demands.
Aliyah's son, Salahuddin, a rickshaw driver, had been snatched from outside his home as he walked to the mosque.
"There was nowhere that I wouldn't go to find my son," Aliyah said. "But we had no idea whether he was dead or alive."
A third man, Daud, had been taken in 2015. With no immediate family to look for him, a neighbor, Seema, became his advocate.
Frustrated by how often the families returned, an employee at the governor's palace told Fazul to put together a list of the missing. A scribe helped Fazul take down the names in his impromptu group: 17 families, at first.
The list, scribbled on a sheet of plain white paper, was soon expanded, passed around, photocopied and texted.
Like Ahmad, many of the victims had been grabbed off the streets or from workplaces by armed men in plainclothes in front of witnesses. Some had simply vanished, like Abdul Wahid, whose brother, a butcher, last saw him when he sent him home with some meat for dinner. Others, like Habib Rahman, had been arrested by uniformed officers while out with friends.
Their relatives clung to the hope that they might still be alive in one of the many unofficial detention sites, often called "private prisons," maintained by Raziq's forces.
The families went to the Red Cross to study photos of unidentified bodies that had been collected and buried, and then to the morgue to see the newly discovered corpses. Some had been suffocated, shot in the head or dumped with their hands still tied.
The group paid bribes to find answers. Most had already shelled out money to unscrupulous police officers, to no avail. Then, in late 2016, a break: One of their missing was returned, finally offering a clear account of what was happening to their loved ones.
Nisar Ahmad, 23, had been abducted a month earlier, not long after a bomb attack targeting one of Raziq's commanders left the area on edge. Two men in plainclothes took him at gunpoint.
Inside a shipping container, a group of men, some in police uniform, took turns beating him, he said. They stuffed a plastic bag into his mouth and poured water over his face, nearly suffocating him. Most shamefully, he said, they twisted his genitals, permanently damaging them.
The police told him to make a confession, and recorded it, he said: "After I confessed, they didn't torture me anymore."
That night, he was blindfolded and driven to another location. Through a barred window, he saw a spindly mountaintop and the green, red and black flag of Afghanistan, he said. (A former police detective said the site appeared to be the District 9 station in Kandahar City.)
Eventually, Nisar's father, Mohammad Fazluddin, received a phone call from a police officer, he said, demanding the equivalent of $ 900 -- a staggering amount -- to release his son. Mohammad agreed, dropping off the money at an auto repair shop as instructed, and his son was let go, he said.
"It's a miracle," he said, taking the release as a sign that the police knew his son was innocent.
In private, the families said, some of the police acknowledged they had taken their loved ones. So, Fazul and the others buttonholed every official possible.
They insisted there was nothing they could do, he said.
"They all knew exactly what was happening," Fazul said. "They said: 'We have nothing to do with this. This is Abdul Raziq's work."'
Finally, Fazul got a meeting with the governor of Kandahar. The mothers joined more than a dozen men to plead and scold for the missing on their list.
Malika, Fazul's mother, was furious, accusing the officials of corruption and cowardice, of robbing her of the most precious thing in life. At one point, they recalled, the governor's guards warned her not to speak so bluntly.
"You people have taken my son," she responded, looking at the governor, people in the room recalled. "If you want to kill me, then kill me, but I won't hold my tongue."
The hectoring paid off. Their list landed on the desk of Raziq himself.
He summoned them for a meeting.
The other war
Disappearances were hardly new in Kandahar, a place ravaged by more than four decades of war. Even Raziq had lost someone.
His father had been a driver, often going to the border with Pakistan. One day, while Raziq was still a boy, his father disappeared on a routine trip, vanishing in the vast desert.
His family, members of the Achakzai tribe, blamed their longtime rivals: the Noorzai. The two tribes had been locked in a deadly feud that stretched back decades, long before the Taliban came to power.
"He was killed because he was Achakzai," Tadin Khan, Raziq's younger brother, told The Times. "His body disappeared."
Raziq went on to author the most brutal campaign of enforced disappearances in his country in decades. And it often targeted this rival tribe, the Noorzai, many of whom supported the Taliban.
That is something the Americans generally failed to understand: A tribal and family dynamic, not just a hatred of the Taliban, animated Raziq's war. In fact, the cluster of villages where Raziq summoned the crowd, killed the two prisoners and then threatened the onlookers was mostly made up of Noorzai.
"He killed them like dogs," said Haji Dilbar, a villager who described being in the crowd that Raziq had assembled to witness the killings.
As his friends tell it, Raziq first picked up a gun as a teenager, fighting under his uncle during the civil war that came after the collapse of the Soviet-backed government. In 1994, his uncle was killed by the Taliban, who hanged his body from the barrel of a tank.
When the U.S. invasion began in 2001, Raziq started fighting on the American side, joining a militia to clear the Taliban out of Kandahar. Later, those same forces became the border police and served under Raziq, still in his 20s at the time.
Largely illiterate, he compensated with his intelligence and charisma, distinguishing himself as a fearless fighter who knew the deserts straddling the border, as his father did.
By 2010, as the Taliban gained ground across the south, Raziq had held back the insurgents in the areas around his home district, called Spin Boldak. American commanders knew he was corrupt, running a mafia-style racket on trade across the border. He was suspected of being involved in the poppy trade.
Allegations of extrajudicial killings also dogged Raziq for years, dating back to the early days of the American-backed government. Noorzai elders said they had complained of murders to American military officials, but were ignored.
Lt. Col. Andrew Green, who worked closely with Raziq in 2010 and 2011, said that confirming the allegations had been impossible because the events happened deep in Taliban territory.
Moreover, he said, law enforcement in Afghanistan was barely functional. The courts were corrupt, and most people could pay their way out of jail, leaving the police with few options.
"In Afghanistan, the police shoot people," he said. "While you can't say it's a good thing, it's sort of what is done."
The worries about Raziq spread. A State Department report documented a 2006 episode in which he executed 16 men he accused of being Taliban. In 2009, he was accused of torture and keeping private prisons by the Afghan human rights commission.
The so-called surge became a major turning point for him. In 2009, hoping to beat back a resurgent Taliban, President Barack Obama announced that he would send thousands of additional troops to Afghanistan, focusing on Kandahar and Helmand Provinces, two Taliban strongholds.
The Americans wanted a partner who was unafraid to confront the Taliban head-on, like Raziq. Yet they were also debating what to do about "bad actors" who undermined the legitimacy of the Afghan government, also like Raziq.
"There were lots of conversations about whether we should mentor Raziq or imprison him," recalled Green, the American officer, who had investigated him for other issues, including graft.
The Americans chose the former. They needed him.
After the police chief of Kandahar was assassinated in 2011, Raziq was given the job. He became a general and appointed commanders from his Achakzai tribe to key positions in Kandahar.
United Nations investigators called four of them -- three of whom were his relatives -- the "four horsemen" for the many allegations of torture and extrajudicial killings against them. One of them, a Raziq family member, was responsible for organizing death squads, according to police officers who worked with him. His men roved the city in unmarked cars, wearing plainclothes.
Deeming the court system corrupt, Raziq ordered his commanders to kill suspected Taliban, former officers and officials said. Those who refused to kill captives were dismissed.
"He told me: 'Why are you bringing these Taliban to the station? Why aren't you killing them? What are you afraid of?"' said one former city district chief who, like some others, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.
The victims were taken for a "sand picnic" and dumped in remote areas, down wells or where the shifting desert sands would cover them, according to former police officers and internal United Nations reports.
One senior police officer said he had complained to Raziq about finding bodies dumped in his district.
"I told him, 'They're in my area; it's going to be blamed on me,"' the officer said. He recalled Raziq laughing before agreeing to tell his men to be more careful.
A 2013 United Nations report noted a surge in unidentified bodies, some still handcuffed, dumped in Kandahar City and dozens of reported disappearances, citing the "increased level of brutality" and torture under Raziq.
Within two months of his appointment as police chief, the Americans stopped transferring detainees to Afghan security forces in Kandahar because of reports of abuses and executions.
"I pulled the intel on the guy and it was pretty horrific," Allen, the American general, said.
Still, American support continued to flow to Raziq, who was popular with U.S. officers and considered vital to winning the war.
While Col. Bill Carty, the head of U.S. Special Forces in Kandahar, was visiting Raziq in 2012, a suicide bomber struck. Carty threw himself on top of Raziq to shield him, and then gave the general his own body armor to wear, according to an account Carty gave in the book, "One Hundred Victories," and confirmed to The Times.
"Why did you give me your vest?" Raziq asked.
"There are thousands of me," Carty recalled replying, emphasizing the importance of Raziq's role as police chief. "But there is only one of you."
Guests of the general
At his headquarters, Raziq greeted Fazul and the other family members in his white civilian robes. Because he couldn't read, his secretary said aloud the names on the list Fazul had provided for him.
Getting the meeting was no easy feat. By then, the Taliban had made so many attempts on the general's life that he joked to friends that he had lost count.
But in person, Raziq was polite, several of the attendees recalled, and allowed each of them to speak their minds. When everyone finished, the general spoke.
He did not trust the courts, the families recounted him saying. The judges let criminals go free, the prosecutors were ineffective, and justice could always be bought for a price. He preferred to administer his own justice.
He spoke to a few family members directly, including Shah Mohammad, whose brother, Neda, was on Fazul's list. The general told him that Neda had been involved in the murder of police officers, an accusation he struggled to believe; Neda sold vegetables from a pushcart in the market.
Before the meeting ended, the general turned to Seema, whose adoptive son Daud had disappeared months earlier. He would be returned, the general said without explanation.
Not long after, Daud was set free.
After getting out, Daud told the families how he had been kept in a dark cell for months at an unofficial detention site. He was beaten and abused regularly, until, after the general's intervention, he was transferred to a formal prison before being let go. He told the others that he had not seen any of their loved ones.
Still, a painful wave of hope washed over the families. They began to dream that, perhaps, their children might still be alive. But that is the problem with hope, and not knowing: Without the closure of death, they could never properly grieve.
For the perpetrators, disappearances carry a cruel logic. Though they can be crimes against humanity, there is little evidence without a body, especially when someone is snatched without witnesses or by officers in civilian clothes and cars.
Yet the disappearances inflicted unique wounds for many Afghans. Often, wives were told they could not remarry until their husbands were proved dead. Some with young children were left unable to support themselves.
"What General Raziq did in terms of killing and disappearing was worse than everything else that happened in the rest of Afghanistan," said Sayed Abdul Karim, the father of one of the young men on Fazul's list. "I wish that we could bury his bones somewhere. If we had a grave, we could go there and pray."
The cruelty bred other cruelties, like the cottage industry of hustlers that emerged to take advantage of parents' desperation. Fazul and his mother fell victim to a scam, traveling to Kabul to pay an intelligence official several thousand dollars for Ahmad's return, a trip that nearly ended with Fazul himself getting kidnapped. Others paid more.
Some decided their families should be joined by more than tragedy alone. Fazul's cousin married the son of the missing rickshaw driver, Salahuddin.
He had been gone so long that, by then, his son was of marrying age.
The insurgents rise
The shock came on Oct. 18, 2018: Raziq was gunned down by a Taliban assassin who had infiltrated the governor's guards.
The Taliban crowed.
They had long used Raziq's brutality to recruit fighters and whip up anger in videos and pamphlets that showcased his abuses.
But his death allowed the insurgents to broadcast their ability to kill even the most protected commanders -- one who was walking just paces away from Miller, the top American commander in Afghanistan, at the time of his death.
The Taliban said they had chosen to target Raziq over anyone else at the meeting, including the American four-star general, who escaped injury.
"He was more important to us than Scott Miller," said Maulavi Ebrar Ahmad Habib, a Taliban commander who oversaw assassinations in Kandahar during those years.
Fazul and the others hoped things would change with Raziq's death. For the most part, nothing did.
Raziq's brother, Tadin, took over as police chief of Kandahar. He told The Times that neither he nor his brother had waged campaigns of forced disappearances. Officials said he simply continued the system his brother had built.
When the war began, Fazul and the others imagined the Americans would bring investment and opportunity. They envisioned good jobs, better homes, prosperity. But their good will evaporated quickly as their loved ones disappeared.
It was not that everyone embraced the Taliban, residents said; they just came to detest the Afghan government and the Americans who propped it up.
That erosion of support -- not just among the families of the missing, but also among many Afghans disenchanted by the broader corruption and unchecked abuses of the Americans and their Afghan partners -- was part of the collapse of Kandahar, as it was elsewhere in the country.
The impunity and criminality that Raziq fostered metastasized after his death, eating away at Kandahar from within. As the Taliban grew stronger, wage and supply theft within government forces devastated morale, as did infighting among his commanders, paralyzing their ability to fight.
Fazul's group prayed for an insurgent victory, clinging to the hope that once the government was toppled, they might discover what had become of their relatives.
And once the United States withdrew from Afghanistan, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government in 2021, the Taliban went from prison to prison, emptying cells.
Thousands of people from across the province flooded into Kandahar City. Fazul heard that hundreds of prisoners had been extracted from the basement of the police headquarters. Huge crowds gathered outside of the governor's compound, jostling for a look at those who exited.
Fazul joined them, racing downtown to scour public facilities. Having no luck in Kandahar City, he and others descended on Spin Boldak, where Raziq got his start. Hundreds waited there, too, scanning the crowds for their missing loved ones. Fazul counted the people freed from unofficial detention sites. His brother wasn't one of them.
Rohullah Akhunzada, who was part of Fazul's group, looked for his own brother in a basement prison, its dank, low ceilings a harrowing indication of what so many Afghans had been forced to endure. He found no sign of him.
"We still don't know," he said.
Having looked everywhere, another of Fazul's compatriots, Fazl Raheem, approached the Taliban to ask for news of his brother.
The Taliban told him that all of the prisons had been emptied. Everyone still alive is already with their families, he recalled them saying.
The crowds drifted, hoping for one more place their loved ones could materialize. Many went to the crowded bus station in Kandahar City to scan the prisoners returning from Bagram Air Base, where the Americans, and later the Afghans, had kept thousands of detainees.
The urgency and desperation rose like a fever. So, too, did the familiar despondence when Fazul's brother was nowhere to be found.
A legacy ignored
Since the collapse, mass graves have turned up in Kandahar, prompting renewed searches from relatives who show up at desert sites and hospital morgues, or share photographs of skeletal remains. But there is no organized search for the missing in Kandahar.
After years of pressure from the United States, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court have said they are de-prioritizing investigations into abuses committed by American-backed forces. The United Nations has focused on abuses carried out by the new Taliban government, accusing it of its own campaign of extrajudicial killings and torture.
The Times sued the American government for its files on Raziq. Nearly a year later, the military and the State Department have turned over only a handful of documents. Few military leaders from that era had any interest in revisiting his legacy, and what it reveals about the American war effort.
"The reason you have insurgencies is because of injustice, and Raziq represented the very worst," said Allen, the American general. He added: "Raziq created the very injustice that gave the Taliban its edge on us."
To commemorate Raziq, the former Afghan government had begun erecting a mausoleum for him, a giant, mosque-like structure beside the governor's palace, a memorial fit for a national hero. Many see him that way, as a champion of those who oppose the Taliban.
Rather than destroy it, the Taliban have surrounded the edifice with concrete blast walls, careful not to antagonize the large swathe of the population that still reveres the general. It is blocked but visible, its dome and minarets peeking over the barrier.
There are no monuments to the missing. Of the 17 people on his original list, Fazul knows of only three who came home alive.
"I still have hope that he will return, even though I know he is probably dead," said Malika, Fazul and Ahmad's mother. "My tears have not dried since he disappeared."

KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — The convoy rumbled into the Taliban heartland, a white desert littered with stones. Over the loudspeakers at the local mosque, the Afghan police officers ordered everyone to gather: The commander was here.
Dozens assembled in the mud square to listen as Abdul Raziq, one of America’s most important partners in the war against the Taliban, stood before the crowd, gesturing at two prisoners he had brought along to make his point.
The prisoners knelt with their hands bound as Raziq spoke to his men. A pair of his officers raised their rifles and opened fire, sending the prisoners into spasms on the reddening earth. In the silence that followed, Raziq addressed the crowd, three witnesses said.
“You will learn to respect me and reject the Taliban,” Raziq said after the killings, which took place in the winter of 2010, according to the witnesses and relatives of both men. “Because I will come back and do this again and again, and no one is going to stop me.”
For years, American military leaders lionized Raziq as a model partner in Afghanistan, their “if only” ally in the battle against the Taliban: If only everyone fought like Raziq, we might actually win this war, American commanders often said.
He ruled over the crucial battleground of Kandahar during a period when the United States had more troops on the ground than in any other chapter of the war, ultimately rising to lieutenant general thanks to the backing of the United States. American generals cycling through Afghanistan made regular pilgrimages to visit him, praising his courage, his ferocious war fighting and the loyalty he commanded from his men, who were trained, armed and paid by the United States and its allies.
The Americans were by his side until the very end. When he was gunned down by an undercover Taliban assassin in 2018, he was walking next to the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin S. Miller, who celebrated him as a “great friend” and “patriot.”
But to countless Afghan civilians under his reign, Raziq was something else entirely: America’s monster.
His battlefield prowess was built on years of torture, extrajudicial killings and the largest-known campaign of forced disappearances during America’s 20-year war in Afghanistan, a New York Times investigation into thousands of cases during his rule found.
The Times obtained hundreds of pages of documents written by the former U.S.-backed government, more than a decade’s worth of hidden ledgers bearing clues to his campaign of abuse. He transformed the police into a fearsome combat force without constraints, and his officers abducted hundreds, if not thousands, of people to be killed or tortured in secret jails, the Times found. Most were never seen again.
The culture of lawlessness and impunity he created flew in the face of endless promises by American presidents, generals and ambassadors to uphold human rights and build a better Afghanistan.
And it helps explain why the United States lost the war.
For nearly two decades, the American public saw only part of the war in Afghanistan. Large parts of the country and its people were off-limits to outsiders, impossible to chronicle fully during the fighting. Now that it’s over, the Taliban are no longer planting roadside bombs, and many have swapped their AK-47s for three-ring binders and a stifling bureaucracy.
The Times spent more than a year visiting parts of Afghanistan that were once active battlefields, trying to figure out what really happened during America’s longest war.
We interviewed many hundreds of people who said their fathers, husbands, sons and brothers had disappeared under Raziq, the police chief responsible for security across Kandahar province, the birthplace of the Taliban. They saw his rule as little more than a brutal campaign against civilians, underwritten by the United States.
His acts not only discredited the American war effort — breeding profound resentment that pushed people to support the Taliban — but embodied it in many ways as well. Across Afghanistan, the United States elevated and empowered warlords, corrupt politicians and outright criminals to prosecute a war of military expediency in which the ends often justified the means.
The Taliban committed countless atrocities of their own against civilians, including suicide attacks, assassinations and kidnappings for ransom.
But it was a mistake to “keep a really bad criminal because he was helpful in fighting worse criminals,” said Gen. John R. Allen, who said he tried to limit cooperation with Raziq when he was overseeing coalition forces in the Afghan war from 2011 to 2013.
While Raziq’s tactics worked in some respects, beating back the Taliban in Kandahar and earning him the admiration of many who opposed them, the strategy came at a clear cost. It stirred such enmity in parts of the population that the Taliban turned his cruelty into a recruiting tool, broadcasting it to attract new fighters. Many Afghans came to revile the U.S.-backed government and everything it represented.
“None of us supported the Taliban, at least not at first,” said Fazul Rahman, whose brother was abducted in front of witnesses during Raziq’s reign. “But when the government collapsed, I ran through the streets, rejoicing.”
Even some who cheered the ruthlessness Raziq wielded against his enemies lamented the broader corruption and criminality he helped enshrine, a key part of why the Afghan government collapsed in 2021. After his death, his commanders expanded their predation further, extorting ordinary people and stealing from their own men’s wages and supplies.
“What they brought under the name of democracy was a system in the hands of a few mafia groups,” said Qari Mohammad Mubarak, who ran a girls’ school in Kandahar and initially supported the government. “The people came to hate democracy.”
Many American commanders, diplomats and their allies in Afghanistan knew at the time they were bankrolling a war that strayed far outside international law.
“Sometimes we asked Raziq about incidents of alleged human rights abuses, and when we got answers we would be like, ‘Whoa, I hope we didn’t implicate ourselves in a war crime just by hearing about it,’” said Henry Ensher, a State Department official who held multiple posts on Afghanistan, including as the top civilian representative in Kandahar in 2010 and 2011, when he worked with Raziq.
“We knew what we were doing, but we didn’t think we had a choice,” Ensher said.
Most American leaders — including more than a dozen interviewed by the Times — said that Raziq had been seen as the only partner capable of beating back the Taliban in the heartland of the insurgency, where a pitched battle for dominance was underway.
“In the moment, we might have succeeded, but so what?” Ensher said. “The entire enterprise was flawed.”
Many Afghans say Raziq used the Americans and their military might to pursue a personal vendetta, taking vengeance against the rivals his tribe had been fighting for decades.
In interviews, many former senior American officials acknowledged that they never grasped that dynamic. It was a defining characteristic over a generation of combat — how little the United States understood about the war it was waging.
The United Nations, human rights groups and news outlets raised serious concerns about Raziq and his forces, but independent investigations were limited, especially with the region so impenetrable during the war.
To determine the extent of the abuses, the Times combed through more than 50,000 handwritten complaints that had been scrawled into the Kandahar governor’s ledgers from 2011 through the end of the war in 2021. In them, we found the rudimentary details of almost 2,200 cases of suspected disappearances.
From there, we went to hundreds of homes across Kandahar and tracked down nearly 1,000 people who said their loved ones had disappeared, been killed or been taken by government security forces.
All together, the Times collected detailed evidence of 368 cases of forced disappearances and dozens of extrajudicial killings attributed to U.S.-backed forces in Kandahar. We counted only cases that were corroborated by at least two people, many of them eyewitnesses to the abductions, and they were often documented with police reports, affidavits and other government records as well.
In all the cases of forced disappearances, the person is still missing.
These figures are almost certainly a gross undercount of the atrocities during Raziq’s reign. We could not canvas all of Kandahar, home to more than 1 million people. And the more than 2,000 suspected cases we found in the government’s ledgers were most likely just an inkling of what really happened. Most of the families we interviewed had never formally reported their loved ones missing, out of fear of retribution or the danger of traveling during the war.
Beyond that, the police destroyed many of their records as the Taliban reached the outskirts of Kandahar City in 2021, former senior officials said. The exact number who were abducted and never seen again may be impossible to know.
What is clear, however, is who was responsible: Only the U.S.-backed government consistently engaged in forced disappearances in Kandahar, former officials, combatants and families of the victims said.
“The Taliban didn’t need to disappear people — they just killed them where they found them,” said Hasti Mohammad, a former government official in charge of the Panjwai district in Kandahar. “The government disappeared people because what they were doing was illegal. They were hiding from the law.”
The cases confirmed by the Times amount to the largest campaign of forced disappearances in Afghanistan since tens of thousands went missing after the Soviet-backed communist coup in 1978, an assessment of previous atrocities shows.
As the victims mourned their loved ones, they confronted their own powerlessness. Raziq was untouchable, thanks to the ironclad support of the United States and its NATO allies.
“We would ask ourselves: ‘Are we creating something here that we may regret later?’” said Col. Robert Waltemeyer, a former Special Forces officer who worked with Raziq.
But there was no one better at fighting the Taliban, he said, adding that he never witnessed Raziq do anything illegal. When the United States sent tens of thousands of American soldiers to Afghanistan during the so-called surge announced in 2009, hoping to wrest control of the south, Raziq was central to the effort.
“He was probably the most important person in the entire surge,” Waltemeyer said.
The United States pushed for Raziq to lead the police forces who fought alongside American troops, he said, because “he showed up, and his troops showed up, to fight, not just to watch the Americans fight.”
In effect, Waltemeyer said, “We created Raziq.”
“You look at every U.S. war and it’s the same,” he said. “We create regrets.”
‘Abdul Raziq’s work’
Fazul Rahman raced to the grease-stained motorcycle shop the moment he got the call: His brother, a mechanic, had just been kidnapped.
In a panic, the shop workers told him that three men in civilian clothes had pulled up in an unmarked Toyota Corolla on the morning of Sept. 3, 2016, asking his brother to take a look at a generator in the trunk.
Then, in full view of a crowd of onlookers, they said, the men wrestled Fazul’s brother, Ahmad, 28, into the car and sped away.
To Fazul and everyone else present, the culprits were obvious: the police. Under Raziq, Kandahar’s security forces had become notorious for snatching anyone they suspected of working with Taliban insurgents. Many simply disappeared. Others turned up as mutilated corpses, discarded in the streets. A lucky few were released alive, bearing wounds and accounts of torture.
Some of the missing were, in fact, Taliban, their families said. Others, their relatives insisted, were not. Many were simply part of the working class: mechanics, tailors and taxi drivers who had nothing to do with the war, their families said.
Desperate to find his brother, Fazul gathered elders and hurried to the local police station. The officers denied arresting his brother, so he headed to the palace of the U.S.-backed governor, joining the line to submit complaints.
The handwritten government ledgers reviewed by the Times show his plea: Volume 4 from 2016, Entry No. 591 — Ahmad, son of Abdur Rahman.
There were thousands of families just like his, all with the same burning question. What had the government done with their loved ones?
After filing his complaint, Fazul worried. What would happen if he pushed too hard? The police were abducting and disappearing people on mere suspicions, never mind someone openly accusing them of kidnapping.
“The police were getting angry,” he said. “They’d beat us and say, ‘Why do you keep coming?’”
Still, another force, more potent than fear, was driving him: his mother, Malika.
Women were rarely seen or heard making public demands in conservative Afghanistan, especially in the south. But Fazul and Ahmad were all their mother had; their father had died of cancer more than 20 years earlier, leaving her to raise them on her own.
“For months, from morning to night, I went from the police to the governor’s offices and waited for someone to see me,” she said.
Outside the offices, scribes charged a small fee to write out complaints for people who, like Fazul and his mother, were illiterate. Many of the petitions were in Malika’s name, and the family provided copies of them to the Times.
“Please help find and release my innocent son,” one said. It carried the signatures of 11 local elders, all attesting that her son was not in the Taliban.
Soon, Fazul and his mother got to know other families searching for missing people. Having a relative arrested on suspicion of being an insurgent tarred them with the same brush. But the presence of women gave them some license to make demands.
Aliyah’s son, Salahuddin, a rickshaw driver, had been snatched from outside his home as he walked to the mosque.
“There was nowhere that I wouldn’t go to find my son,” Aliyah said. “But we had no idea whether he was dead or alive.”
A third man, Daud, had been taken in 2015. With no immediate family to look for him, a neighbor, Seema, became his advocate.
Frustrated by how often the families returned, an employee at the governor’s palace told Fazul to put together a list of the missing. A scribe helped Fazul take down the names in his impromptu group: 17 families, at first.
The list, scribbled on a sheet of plain white paper, was soon expanded, passed around, photocopied and texted.
Like Ahmad, many of the victims had been grabbed off the streets or from workplaces by armed men in plainclothes in front of witnesses. Some had simply vanished, like Abdul Wahid, whose brother, a butcher, last saw him when he sent him home with some meat for dinner. Others, like Habib Rahman, had been arrested by uniformed officers while out with friends.
Their relatives clung to the hope that they might still be alive in one of the many unofficial detention sites, often called “private prisons,” maintained by Raziq’s forces.
The families went to the Red Cross to study photos of unidentified bodies that had been collected and buried, and then to the morgue to see the newly discovered corpses. Some had been suffocated, shot in the head or dumped with their hands still tied.
The group paid bribes to find answers. Most had already shelled out money to unscrupulous police officers, to no avail. Then, in late 2016, a break: One of their missing was returned, finally offering a clear account of what was happening to their loved ones.
Nisar Ahmad, 23, had been abducted a month earlier, not long after a bomb attack targeting one of Raziq’s commanders left the area on edge. Two men in plainclothes took him at gunpoint.
Inside a shipping container, a group of men, some in police uniform, took turns beating him, he said. They stuffed a plastic bag into his mouth and poured water over his face, nearly suffocating him. Most shamefully, he said, they twisted his genitals, permanently damaging them.
The police told him to make a confession, and recorded it, he said: “After I confessed, they didn’t torture me anymore.”
That night, he was blindfolded and driven to another location. Through a barred window, he saw a spindly mountaintop and the green, red and black flag of Afghanistan, he said. (A former police detective said the site appeared to be the District 9 station in Kandahar City.)
Eventually, Nisar’s father, Mohammad Fazluddin, received a phone call from a police officer, he said, demanding the equivalent of $900 — a staggering amount — to release his son. Mohammad agreed, dropping off the money at an auto repair shop as instructed, and his son was let go, he said.
“It’s a miracle,” he said, taking the release as a sign that the police knew his son was innocent.
In private, the families said, some of the police acknowledged they had taken their loved ones. So, Fazul and the others buttonholed every official possible.
They insisted there was nothing they could do, he said.
“They all knew exactly what was happening,” Fazul said. “They said: ‘We have nothing to do with this. This is Abdul Raziq’s work.’”
Finally, Fazul got a meeting with the governor of Kandahar. The mothers joined more than a dozen men to plead and scold for the missing on their list.
Malika, Fazul’s mother, was furious, accusing the officials of corruption and cowardice, of robbing her of the most precious thing in life. At one point, they recalled, the governor’s guards warned her not to speak so bluntly.
“You people have taken my son,” she responded, looking at the governor, people in the room recalled. “If you want to kill me, then kill me, but I won’t hold my tongue.”
The hectoring paid off. Their list landed on the desk of Raziq himself.
He summoned them for a meeting.
The other war
Disappearances were hardly new in Kandahar, a place ravaged by more than four decades of war. Even Raziq had lost someone.
His father had been a driver, often going to the border with Pakistan. One day, while Raziq was still a boy, his father disappeared on a routine trip, vanishing in the vast desert.
His family, members of the Achakzai tribe, blamed their longtime rivals: the Noorzai. The two tribes had been locked in a deadly feud that stretched back decades, long before the Taliban came to power.
“He was killed because he was Achakzai,” Tadin Khan, Raziq’s younger brother, told the Times. “His body disappeared.”
Raziq went on to author the most brutal campaign of enforced disappearances in his country in decades. And it often targeted this rival tribe, the Noorzai, many of whom supported the Taliban.
That is something the Americans generally failed to understand: A tribal and family dynamic, not just a hatred of the Taliban, animated Raziq’s war. In fact, the cluster of villages where Raziq summoned the crowd, killed the two prisoners and then threatened the onlookers was mostly made up of Noorzai.
“He killed them like dogs,” said Haji Dilbar, a villager who described being in the crowd that Raziq had assembled to witness the killings.
As his friends tell it, Raziq first picked up a gun as a teenager, fighting under his uncle during the civil war that came after the collapse of the Soviet-backed government. In 1994, his uncle was killed by the Taliban, who hanged his body from the barrel of a tank.
When the U.S. invasion began in 2001, Raziq started fighting on the American side, joining a militia to clear the Taliban out of Kandahar. Later, those same forces became the border police and served under Raziq, still in his 20s at the time.
Largely illiterate, he compensated with his intelligence and charisma, distinguishing himself as a fearless fighter who knew the deserts straddling the border, as his father did.
By 2010, as the Taliban gained ground across the south, Raziq had held back the insurgents in the areas around his home district, called Spin Boldak. American commanders knew he was corrupt, running a mafia-style racket on trade across the border. He was suspected of being involved in the poppy trade.
Allegations of extrajudicial killings also dogged Raziq for years, dating back to the early days of the U.S.-backed government. Noorzai elders said they had complained of murders to American military officials, but were ignored.
Lt. Col. Andrew Green, who worked closely with Raziq in 2010 and 2011, said that confirming the allegations had been impossible because the events happened deep in Taliban territory.
Moreover, he said, law enforcement in Afghanistan was barely functional. The courts were corrupt, and most people could pay their way out of jail, leaving the police with few options.
“In Afghanistan, the police shoot people,” he said. “While you can’t say it’s a good thing, it’s sort of what is done.”
The worries about Raziq spread. A State Department report documented a 2006 episode in which he executed 16 men he accused of being Taliban. In 2009, he was accused of torture and keeping private prisons by the Afghan human rights commission.
The so-called surge became a major turning point for him. In 2009, hoping to beat back a resurgent Taliban, President Barack Obama announced that he would send thousands of additional troops to Afghanistan, focusing on Kandahar and Helmand provinces, two Taliban strongholds.
The Americans wanted a partner who was unafraid to confront the Taliban head-on, like Raziq. Yet they were also debating what to do about “bad actors” who undermined the legitimacy of the Afghan government, also like Raziq.
“There were lots of conversations about whether we should mentor Raziq or imprison him,” recalled Green, who had investigated him for other issues, including graft.
The Americans chose the former. They needed him.
After the police chief of Kandahar was assassinated in 2011, Raziq was given the job. He became a general and appointed commanders from his Achakzai tribe to key positions in Kandahar.
United Nations investigators called four of them — three of whom were his relatives — the “four horsemen” for the many allegations of torture and extrajudicial killings against them. One of them, a Raziq family member, was responsible for organizing death squads, according to police officers who worked with him. His men roved the city in unmarked cars, wearing plainclothes.
Deeming the court system corrupt, Raziq ordered his commanders to kill suspected Taliban, former officers and officials said. Those who refused to kill captives were dismissed.
“He told me: ‘Why are you bringing these Taliban to the station? Why aren’t you killing them? What are you afraid of?’” said one former city district chief who, like some others, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.
The victims were taken for a “sand picnic” and dumped in remote areas, down wells or where the shifting desert sands would cover them, according to former police officers and internal United Nations reports.
One senior police officer said he had complained to Raziq about finding bodies dumped in his district.
“I told him, ‘They’re in my area; it’s going to be blamed on me,’” the officer said. He recalled Raziq laughing before agreeing to tell his men to be more careful.
A 2013 United Nations report noted a surge in unidentified bodies, some still handcuffed, dumped in Kandahar City and dozens of reported disappearances, citing the “increased the level of brutality” and torture under Raziq.
Within two months of his appointment as police chief, the Americans stopped transferring detainees to Afghan security forces in Kandahar because of reports of abuses and executions.
“I pulled the intel on the guy, and it was pretty horrific,” Allen said.
Still, American support continued to flow to Raziq, who was popular with U.S. officers and considered vital to winning the war.
While Col. Bill Carty, the head of U.S. Special Forces in Kandahar, was visiting Raziq in 2012, a suicide bomber struck. Carty threw himself on top of Raziq to shield him, and then gave the general his own body armor to wear, according to an account Carty gave in the book, “One Hundred Victories,” and confirmed to the Times.
“Why did you give me your vest?” Raziq asked.
“There are thousands of me,” Carty recalled replying, emphasizing the importance of Raziq’s role as police chief. “But there is only one of you.”
Guests of the general
At his headquarters, Raziq greeted Fazul and the other family members in his white civilian robes. Because he couldn’t read, his secretary said aloud the names on the list Fazul had provided for him.
Getting the meeting was no easy feat. By then, the Taliban had made so many attempts on the general’s life that he joked to friends that he had lost count.
But in person, Raziq was polite, several of the attendees recalled, and allowed each of them to speak their minds. When everyone finished, the general spoke.
He did not trust the courts, the families recounted him saying. The judges let criminals go free, the prosecutors were ineffective, and justice could always be bought for a price. He preferred to administer his own justice.
He spoke to a few family members directly, including Shah Mohammad, whose brother, Neda, was on Fazul’s list. The general told him that Neda had been involved in the murder of police officers, an accusation he struggled to believe; Neda sold vegetables from a pushcart in the market.
Before the meeting ended, the general turned to Seema, whose adoptive son Daud had disappeared months earlier. He would be returned, the general said without explanation.
Not long after, Daud was set free.
After getting out, Daud told the families how he had been kept in a dark cell for months at an unofficial detention site. He was beaten and abused regularly, until, after the general’s intervention, he was transferred to a formal prison before being let go. He told the others that he had not seen any of their loved ones.
Still, a painful wave of hope washed over the families. They began to dream that, perhaps, their children might still be alive. But that is the problem with hope, and not knowing: Without the closure of death, they could never properly grieve.
For the perpetrators, disappearances carry a cruel logic. Though they can be crimes against humanity, there is little evidence without a body, especially when someone is snatched without witnesses or by officers in civilian clothes and cars.
Yet the disappearances inflicted unique wounds for many Afghans. Often, wives were told they could not remarry until their husbands were proved dead. Some with young children were left unable to support themselves.
“What General Raziq did in terms of killing and disappearing was worse than everything else that happened in the rest of Afghanistan,” said Sayed Abdul Karim, the father of one of the young men on Fazul’s list. “I wish that we could bury his bones somewhere. If we had a grave, we could go there and pray.”
The cruelty bred other cruelties, like the cottage industry of hustlers that emerged to take advantage of parents’ desperation. Fazul and his mother fell victim to a scam, traveling to Kabul to pay an intelligence official several thousand dollars for Ahmad’s return, a trip that nearly ended with Fazul himself getting kidnapped. Others paid more.
Some decided their families should be joined by more than tragedy alone. Fazul’s cousin married the son of the missing rickshaw driver, Saluhuddin.
He had been gone so long that, by then, his son was of marrying age.
The insurgents rise
The shock came on Oct. 18, 2018: Raziq was gunned down by a Taliban assassin who had infiltrated the governor’s guards.
The Taliban crowed.
They had long used Raziq’s brutality to recruit fighters and whip up anger in videos and pamphlets that showcased his abuses.
But his death allowed the insurgents to broadcast their ability to kill even the most protected commanders — one who was walking just paces away from Miller, the top American commander in Afghanistan, at the time of his death.
The Taliban said they had chosen to target Raziq over anyone else at the meeting, including the American four-star general, who escaped injury.
“He was more important to us than Scott Miller,” said Maulavi Ebrar Ahmad Habib, a Taliban commander who oversaw assassinations in Kandahar during those years.
Fazul and the others hoped things would change with Raziq’s death. For the most part, nothing did.
Raziq’s brother, Tadin, took over as police chief of Kandahar. He told the Times that neither he nor his brother had waged campaigns of forced disappearances. Officials said he simply continued the system his brother had built.
When the war began, Fazul and the others imagined the Americans would bring investment and opportunity. They envisioned good jobs, better homes, prosperity. But their good will evaporated quickly as their loved ones disappeared.
It was not that everyone embraced the Taliban, residents said; they just came to detest the Afghan government and the Americans who propped it up.
That erosion of support — not just among the families of the missing, but also among many Afghans disenchanted by the broader corruption and unchecked abuses of the Americans and their Afghan partners — was part of the collapse of Kandahar, as it was elsewhere in the country.
The impunity and criminality that Raziq fostered metastasized after his death, eating away at Kandahar from within. As the Taliban grew stronger, wage and supply theft within government forces devastated morale, as did infighting among his commanders, paralyzing their ability to fight.
Fazul’s group prayed for an insurgent victory, clinging to the hope that once the government was toppled, they might discover what had become of their relatives.
And once the United States withdrew from Afghanistan, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government in 2021, the Taliban went from prison to prison, emptying cells.
Thousands of people from across the province flooded into Kandahar City. Fazul heard that hundreds of prisoners had been extracted from the basement of the police headquarters. Huge crowds gathered outside of the governor’s compound, jostling for a look at those who exited.
Fazul joined them, racing downtown to scour public facilities. Having no luck in Kandahar City, he and others descended on Spin Boldak, where Raziq got his start. Hundreds waited there, too, scanning the crowds for their missing loved ones. Fazul counted the people freed from unofficial detention sites. His brother wasn’t one of them.
Rohullah Akhunzada, who was part of Fazul’s group, looked for his own brother in a basement prison, its dank, low ceilings a harrowing indication of what so many Afghans had been forced to endure. He found no sign of him.
“We still don’t know,” he said.
Having looked everywhere, another of Fazul’s compatriots, Fazl Raheem, approached the Taliban to ask for news of his brother.
The Taliban told him that all of the prisons had been emptied. Everyone still alive is already with their families, he recalled them saying.
The crowds drifted, hoping for one more place their loved ones could materialize. Many went to the crowded bus station in Kandahar City to scan the prisoners returning from Bagram Air Base, where the Americans, and later the Afghans, had kept thousands of detainees.
The urgency and desperation rose like a fever. So, too, did the familiar despondence when Fazul’s brother was nowhere to be found.
A legacy ignored
Since the collapse, mass graves have turned up in Kandahar, prompting renewed searches from relatives who show up at desert sites and hospital morgues, or share photographs of skeletal remains. But there is no organized search for the missing in Kandahar.
After years of pressure from the United States, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court have said they are de-prioritizing investigations into abuses committed by U.S.-backed forces. The United Nations has focused on abuses carried out by the new Taliban government, accusing it of its own campaign of extrajudicial killings and torture.
The Times sued the U.S. government for its files on Raziq. Nearly a year later, the military and the State Department have turned over only a handful of documents. Few military leaders from that era had any interest in revisiting his legacy, and what it reveals about the American war effort.
“The reason you have insurgencies is because of injustice, and Raziq represented the very worst,” Allen said. He added: “Raziq created the very injustice that gave the Taliban its edge on us.”
To commemorate Raziq, the former Afghan government had begun erecting a mausoleum for him, a giant, mosque-like structure beside the governor’s palace, a memorial fit for a national hero. Many see him that way, as a champion of those who oppose the Taliban.
Rather than destroy it, the Taliban have surrounded the edifice with concrete blast walls, careful not to antagonize the large swath of the population that still reveres the general. It is blocked but visible, its dome and minarets peeking over the barrier.
There are no monuments to the missing. Of the 17 people on his original list, Fazul knows of only three who came home alive.
“I still have hope that he will return, even though I know he is probably dead,” said Malika, Fazul and Ahmad’s mother. “My tears have not dried since he disappeared.”

Full text: After Mercedes workers voted against joining the United Automobile Workers, the union will have less momentum as it campaigns to organize Southern factories.
After suffering a setback at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama on Friday, the United Automobile Workers union's efforts to organize other auto factories in the South are likely to slow and could struggle to make headway.
About 56 percent of the Mercedes workers who voted rejected the U.A.W. in an election after the union chalked up two major wins this year. In April, workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee voted to join the union, the first large nonunion auto plant in the South to do so. Weeks later, the union negotiated a new contract bringing significant pay and benefit improvements for its members at several North Carolina factories owned by Daimler Truck.
"Losing at Mercedes is not death for the union," said Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. "It just means they'll have less confidence going to the next plant. The U.A.W. is in it for the long run. I don't think they're going to stop just because they lost here."
Since its founding in 1935, the U.A.W. has almost exclusively represented workers employed by the three Michigan-based automakers: General Motors, Ford Motor, and Chrysler, now part of Stellantis. And it has long struggled to make headway at plants owned by foreign manufacturers, especially in Southern states where anti-union sentiment runs deep.
Workers at the Volkswagen plant had voted against being represented by the U.A.W. twice by narrow margins before the recent union win there. An effort a decade ago to organize one of the Mercedes plants failed to build enough support for an election.
Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, noted that broad union organizing efforts seldom proceeded smoothly. In the 1930s, the U.A.W. won recognition at G.M. and Chrysler but struggled at Ford, which continued employing nonunion workers for a few years.
"I have no doubt they will continue organizing and eventually try for another vote," he said.
In its past efforts in the South, the union was hampered by a negative image, which may have also played a part in the U.A.W.'s loss at Mercedes. For years, the three Michigan automakers were cutting jobs and closing plants, in part because of rigid and costly labor contracts. The union was also hurt by corruption cases that put several former senior officials, including two former U.A.W. presidents, behind bars.
Business leaders in Alabama ran a campaign against the U.A.W. that was based in part on the contention that the union was responsible for the decline of Detroit. In a January opinion essay published in The Alabama Daily News, the chief executive of the Business Council of Alabama, Helena Duncan, said the state would suffer the same fate if workers voted for the union.
"Much of the decay that exists in the 'Motor City' today results from untenable demands that the U.A.W. placed on its automobile manufacturers, an unwise move that sent untold numbers of jobs to right-to-work states like ours and crippled a once great metropolis," Ms. Duncan wrote.
A year ago, the union elected a new president, Shawn Fain, who was untouched by the corruption scandals and vowed to take a more aggressive approach in contract talks. Then last fall, the union came away with substantial pay and benefit gains in negotiations with the Detroit automakers, after targeted strikes over some 40 days. Hundreds of Southern autoworkers began reaching out, asking for help organizing their nonunion plants. The U.A.W. responded by announcing that it would spend $ 40 million on organizing drives over the next two years.
"I'm not scared at all," Mr. Fain said Friday in Alabama after the union lost the Mercedes vote. "I believe workers want unions, I believe they want justice, and we're going to continue doing what we can do."
Mercedes in a statement emphasized its direct relationship with workers and said it looked forward to making sure the company was "not only their employer of choice, but a place they would recommend to friends and family."
The union has signaled that it expects to focus its organizing efforts on another Alabama plant -- a Hyundai factory in Montgomery. But organizing that plant will probably be even harder than the campaign at the Mercedes factories, said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor who follows the auto industry.
The U.A.W. had allies at Volkswagen and Mercedes. Unions are powerful players in Germany, where those two companies are based. Under German law, worker representatives must occupy half the seats on a company's supervisory board, the equivalent of an American board of directors.
Volkswagen and Mercedes both have groups called works councils through which managers and employees discuss and negotiate workplace issues and production plans. In its drive at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, the U.A.W. had the support of the company's works council and IG Metall, the powerful union that represents all German automotive workers.
The U.A.W. won't have that kind of support at Hyundai's Montgomery plant, Mr. Gordon said. "In general, Korean car companies have more adversarial relationships with unions than do the German manufacturers," he said. "Korean companies are less used to sitting together in a conference room with unions."
Last year, weeks after the U.A.W. won pay and benefit increases from the three Michigan-based automakers, Hyundai announced that it would increase its workers' pay sharply over the next four years -- a move widely seen as an attempt to dampen workers' interest in joining the U.A.W.
"The decision to be represented by a union is up to our team members," Hyundai said in a statement.
The Montgomery plant makes two popular sport utility vehicles -- the Tucson and Santa Fe -- and employs about 4,000 workers. An earlier U.A.W. drive to organize the plant in 2016 petered out without coming to a vote.
Last fall, the union said it planned to target plants owned by 10 foreign-owned automakers -- Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo -- and others owned by Tesla, which is based in Texas, and two smaller electric vehicle start-ups, Lucid and Rivian, both based in California.
The U.S. plants owned by those foreign and U.S. companies employ nearly 150,000 workers in 13 states, the union said.
In Alabama, however, the U.A.W. faced perhaps a more hostile environment than anywhere else. While it was campaigning at Mercedes, Gov. Kay Ivey spoke out against the union and headed a group of six Southern governors, all Republicans, who issued a letter suggesting unionizing could cause automakers to move jobs out of their states. One senior Alabama politician described the U.A.W. as "leeches."
Mercedes brought in Nick Saban, the hugely popular former football coach at the University of Alabama, to talk to workers in an effort to persuade them to vote against the U.A.W.
Unions are traditionally seen as a Northern institution and are often linked with the civil rights movement, which alienates many people in Alabama, Mr. Gordon said. "It's a very tough place for the U.A.W.," he said.
That antipathy could also make it hard for the U.A.W. to negotiate contracts guaranteeing its members raises and other gains even if it wins unionizing votes. Lawmakers who oppose unions may put pressure on employers not to make big concessions in negotiations.
Mr. Fain and the U.A.W. have argued that unions are the best way for workers to demand higher wages when automakers are enjoying strong sales and profits in North America.
Public support of unions is stronger than it has been in years, including in the South. This year, 600 workers at an electric bus factory in Alabama voted to join the Communications Workers of America union. A week ago, they negotiated a new contract delivering pay raises and enhanced benefits.
The U.A.W. and other unions also have enjoyed the support of President Biden, who last fall joined striking autoworkers on a picket line in Michigan. The union endorsed Mr. Biden in this year's election.
But that close association with the president may also hurt the U.A.W. with conservative workers in a Southern state who prefer Mr. Biden's opponent -- former President Donald J. Trump. Mr. Fain and Mr. Trump have often criticized each other, but polls have shown that a sizable minority of union households support the former president.

Workers Reject Bid in Alabama For Auto Union: [National Desk]

Full text: The election, fiercely opposed by the state's political leaders, was seen as a test of the United Automobile Workers' ability to unionize factories in the South.
Workers at two Mercedes-Benz factories near Tuscaloosa, Ala., voted on Friday against allowing the United Automobile Workers to represent them, a stunning blow to the union's campaign to gain ground in the South, where it has traditionally been weak.
The defeat came after Kay Ivey, Alabama's governor, and other Republican leaders argued that a pro-union vote would choke off the investment that has transformed the state into a major auto producer. The union's setback dims the chances that it will be able to quickly organize workers at Hyundai and Honda, which also have large factories in Alabama.
The vote had national significance as a test of whether the U.A.W. could build on a string of recent victories and make strides in a state whose elected officials have been hostile to organized labor. The union has said it wants to organize every automobile factory in the United States, expanding its membership to include the employees of companies like Toyota and Tesla.
But the loss at the Mercedes plants will almost surely slow down the union's campaign and probably force it to do more spadework to secure the support of workers before seeking to hold elections at other auto plants. Union leaders will want to spend time figuring out how best to counter the messages and tactics of local lawmakers and company executives.
"This loss stings," Shawn Fain, the president of the U.A.W., said at the storefront headquarters of the union's local branch down the road from the Mercedes factories in Vance and Woodstock, Ala.
But "most of us lost elections in our lives," he added. "We learn from it. We move forward, and that's what we intend to do."
Mercedes workers voted 56 percent to 44 percent against joining the union, according to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election. Close to 4,700 ballots were cast, representing a large majority of the 5,075 employees who were eligible to vote.
Auto executives and conservative lawmakers are likely to closely study the vote at Mercedes to figure out the best approaches to fend off the U.A.W. and other unions in future contests and to deter union campaigns from the get-go.
"The workers in Vance have spoken, and they have spoken clearly!" Ms. Ivey said in a statement. "Alabama is not Michigan, and we are not the sweet home to the U.A.W."
The South has become an important battleground. States like Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee are attracting much of the billions of dollars that automakers and suppliers are investing in electric vehicle and battery factories. The U.A.W. wants to represent workers at those factories.
Mercedes produces sport utility vehicles in Vance and battery packs for electric vehicles in Woodstock. Polling had been underway all week at the two factories.
"We thank all team members who asked questions, engaged in discussions and, ultimately, made their voices heard on this important issue," the company said in a statement on Friday.
In a campaign conducted largely by word of mouth, union activists argued that in addition to better pay and benefits, the U.A.W. would protect Mercedes workers from abrupt changes in their schedules and long shifts, including on weekends.
"If it wasn't for us building those cars, you wouldn't be putting the money that you're putting in your pockets," said Kay Finklea, who works in quality control at Mercedes and campaigned for the union. "So treat us with dignity, treat us with respect and pay us."
But activists acknowledged that many workers who were unhappy with working conditions at Mercedes were also reluctant to join the union, swayed by warnings from company executives and politicians that membership would lead to onerous dues and loss of control over their jobs.
Mercedes tried hard to block the union. Last month, in an apparent attempt to address employee complaints, the company shook up local management, appointing Federico Kochlowski as chief executive of the German company's U.S. unit.
Mr. Kochlowski, who has worked at Mercedes for about 20 years in various manufacturing positions in China, Mexico and the United States, acknowledged that there were problems at the Alabama plants and promised to make improvements.
"I understand that many things are not OK," he said in a video posted by Mercedes online. "Give me a shot."
Bart Moore, who works in material handling at Mercedes delivering parts to the assembly line, said he was hopeful that Mr. Kochlowski would follow through on his promises. "We'll see what he comes through with," Mr. Moore said. "You never know."
The U.A.W. has filed six charges of unfair labor practices against Mercedes with the labor relations board, saying the company disciplined employees for discussing unionization at work, prevented organizers from distributing union materials, conducted surveillance of workers and fired workers who supported the union.
"This company, like most others, operated off the same playbook of fear, threats, intimidation," Mr. Fain said Friday.
Mercedes denies the claims.
Past attempts by the U.A.W. to represent workers at Mercedes and other automakers in the South had failed. But the U.A.W. is stronger than it has been in years after winning a unionization vote last month at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee where it previously lost two elections. The union also won hefty pay raises last year for workers at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram.
Mercedes's campaign against the union "had way more effect than we anticipated," said Robert Lett, who works in the Woodstock battery factory and campaigned for the union. But he said the union would try again.
"It doesn't change our resolve," Mr. Lett said of the loss. "The fire is there for a change."

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — Workers at two Mercedes-Benz factories near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, voted Friday against allowing the United Auto Workers to represent them, a stunning blow to the union’s campaign to gain ground in the South, where it has traditionally been weak.
The defeat came after Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey and other Republican leaders argued that a pro-union vote would choke off the investment that has transformed the state into a major auto producer. The union’s setback dims the chances that it will be able to quickly organize workers at Hyundai and Honda, which also have large factories in Alabama.

Mercedes workers voted 56% to 44% against joining the union, according to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election. Close to 4,700 ballots were cast, representing a large majority of the 5,075 employees who were eligible to vote.
Auto executives and conservative lawmakers are likely to closely study the vote at Mercedes to figure out the best approaches to fend off the UAW and other unions in future contests and to deter union campaigns from the get-go.
“The workers in Vance have spoken, and they have spoken clearly!” Ivey said in a statement. “Alabama is not Michigan, and we are not the sweet home to the UAW.”
The South has become an important battleground. States including Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee are attracting much of the billions of dollars that automakers and suppliers are investing in electric vehicle and battery factories. The UAW wants to represent workers at those factories.
Mercedes produces SUVs at a factory in Vance and battery packs for electric vehicles in Woodstock. Polling had been underway all week at the two factories.
“We thank all team members who asked questions, engaged in discussions and, ultimately, made their voices heard on this important issue,” the company said in a statement Friday.
In a campaign conducted largely by word-of-mouth, union activists argued that in addition to better pay and benefits, the UAW would protect Mercedes workers from abrupt changes in their schedules and long shifts, including on weekends.
“ If it wasn’t for us building those cars, you wouldn’t be putting the money that you’re putting in your pockets,” said Kay Finklea, who works in quality control at Mercedes and campaigned for the union. “So treat us with dignity, treat us with respect and pay us.”
But activists acknowledged that many workers who were unhappy with working conditions at Mercedes were also reluctant to join the union, swayed by warnings from company executives and politicians that membership would lead to onerous dues and loss of control over their jobs.
Mercedes tried hard to block the union. Last month, in an apparent attempt to address employee complaints, the company shook up local management, appointing Federico Kochlowski as CEO of the German company’s U.S. unit.
Kochlowski, who has worked at Mercedes for about 20 years in various manufacturing positions in China, Mexico and the United States, acknowledged that there were problems at the Alabama plants and promised to make improvements. “I understand that many things are not OK,” he said in a video posted by Mercedes online. “Give me a shot.”
Bart Moore, who works in material handling at Mercedes delivering parts to the assembly line, said he was hopeful that Kochlowski would follow through on his promises. “We’ll see what he comes through with,” Moore said. “You never know.”
The UAW has filed six charges of unfair labor practices against Mercedes with the NLRB, saying the company disciplined employees for discussing unionization at work, prevented organizers from distributing union materials, conducted surveillance of workers and fired workers who supported the union.
“This company, like most others, operated off the same playbook of fear, threats, intimidation,” Fain said Friday.
Mercedes denies the claims.
Past attempts by the UAW to represent workers at Mercedes and other automakers in the South had failed. But the UAW is stronger than it has been in years after winning a unionization vote last month at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee where it previously lost two elections. The union also won hefty pay raises last year for workers at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram.
Mercedes’ campaign against the union “had way more effect than we anticipated,” said Robert Lett, who works in the Woodstock battery factory and campaigned for the union. But he said the union would try again.
“It doesn’t change our resolve,” Lett said of the loss. “The fire is there for a change.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Southern political leaders say a win for the United Automobile Workers would threaten their economies. Activists want to strike a blow against a system they say exploits the poor.
More than 5,000 Mercedes-Benz workers in Alabama are voting this week on whether to join the United Automobile Workers union, a decision both supporters and opponents say will have consequences far beyond two factories near Tuscaloosa where the German carmaker churns out luxury sport utility vehicles and batteries for electric cars.
Conservative political leaders have portrayed the union campaign to organize Mercedes workers as an assault by outsiders on the region's economy and way of life. The vote tally is expected to be released by federal officials on Friday.
Six Southern governors, including Kay Ivey, an Alabama Republican, issued a statement last month criticizing unions as "special interests looking to come into our state and threaten our jobs and the values we live by." Alabama recently passed a law intended to discourage union organizing.
For the union, a win would add to a string of victories in the South, where organized labor has traditionally been weak, and provide momentum to the U.A.W.'s efforts to win over workers at other nonunion automakers like Hyundai, Toyota, Honda and Tesla.
If the U.A.W. loses, it could sharply slow down a campaign by the union's president, Shawn Fain, to organize auto and battery plants across the country. That effort began after the union last fall reached new contracts with hefty pay raises and other benefits for workers at General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram.
In Alabama, which was a crucible of the civil rights movement, union organizers and supporters cast the Mercedes campaign as part of a decades-long struggle to dismantle an economic system based on exploitation of poor people.
"You are not just fighting for a union," Bishop William Barber II, an activist and professor at the Yale Divinity School, told a group of organizers, workers and supporters at a Montgomery church on Monday. "You are fighting for justice."
U.A.W. supporters were optimistic as workers cast their ballots at a Mercedes car factory in Vance, Ala., and at a company-owned factory in nearby Woodstock that assembles battery packs for electric vehicles. The National Labor Relations Board is overseeing the weeklong polling.
"I feel like we have the upper hand right now," said Sammie Ellis, a union organizer who installs wiring in Mercedes vehicles. He spoke outside a cluttered storefront office down the road from the factory in Vance where activists seated on folding chairs plotted strategy amid piles of placards with slogans like "Mercedes Workers United" and "End the Alabama Discount."
The Alabama discount is a reference to what union activists say is the state's main attraction to investors: low wages and compliant workers. "They come to take advantage of how Alabama workers are living in poorer conditions than workers in other parts of the country," said Joe Cleveland, an official with an International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers local in Anniston, Ala.
Mercedes said in a statement that the company "has a proven record of competitively compensating team members and providing many additional benefits."
Workers who have been at Mercedes for four years can earn $ 34 an hour, and some employees say they are grateful for the way the company has treated them.
"Mercedes has done a lot for me," Yolanda Berry, a team leader at the carmaker, said in a video posted on X by Autos Drive America, an industry association that represents Mercedes and other foreign automakers with plants in the United States. Ms. Berry said she had earned less than $ 14 an hour at a previous job.
The U.A.W. is on a roll in the South after workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., voted in April to be represented by the union. Also that month, the union won significant pay raises for Daimler Truck workers in North Carolina. A victory at Mercedes, which became a separate company from Daimler Truck in 2021, would bolster the union in its next campaign, organizing workers at a Hyundai factory in Montgomery, about 100 miles south of Tuscaloosa.
The South Korean company produces S.U.V.s at the Montgomery plant, including the Tucson and Santa Fe models. Union organizers are also targeting a Honda factory in Lincoln, Ala., where the Japanese company makes S.U.V.s and pickups. But that effort is in its early stages.
On Monday, about 50 activists and Hyundai workers gathered at Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Montgomery to sing union fight songs and hear from Bishop Barber.
Paraphrasing the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Bishop Barber accused Southern political leaders of pitting races against each other. They fear Blacks "and poor whites uniting together and forming a voting bloc that does fundamentally reshape the economic architecture of the country and of the state," he said.
Opposition to the union from Alabama's Republican political leadership has been intense. After likening the U.A.W. to "leeches," Nathaniel Ledbetter, the Republican speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives, helped push through a law that denies state funding to companies that voluntarily recognize unions.
The law will not directly affect the Mercedes vote, but it reflected the state of alarm among Republicans with close ties to business interests and their determination to stop union advances. Ms. Ivey signed the bill into law on Monday.
A spokeswoman for Ms. Ivey declined a request for an interview, referring to public statements she has made on the issue.
"Unionization would certainly put our states' jobs in jeopardy," Ms. Ivey said in a statement she issued with the governors of Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, all Republicans.
Mr. Ledbetter's office did not respond to requests for comment.
A union drive at the Hyundai factory in Alabama in 2016 failed, but activists say things have changed. "The first time around, people were easily intimidated and scared by anti-union tactics," said Quichelle Liggins, who has worked at the Hyundai factory for 12 years. "This time, we're ready."
In an apparent effort to blunt the appeal of a union, Hyundai was one of several automakers that raised worker pay after the U.A.W. won gains for members at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis. The raises at Hyundai, announced in November, amounted to 14 percent over the previous year, according to the company.
But pay is not the only issue for many autoworkers in Alabama. Ms. Liggins, a single mother of two, said she hoped a union would protect people like her from long hours and unpredictable work schedules. "I had a manager tell me my job was more important than my family," she said.
In a statement, Hyundai said, "We are deeply committed to supporting quality jobs that pay competitive salaries and offer industry-leading benefits."
The company said that, with rare exceptions, it gave employees 30 days of notice about changes to their schedules. Employees are not required to work more than 10 hours a day, Hyundai said in a statement, and overtime is voluntary except during the introduction of a new model when repair and quality control teams may be required to work longer.
Mercedes, based in Stuttgart, Germany, is used to dealing with unions in its home country, where by law half the members of the company's supervisory board represent employees. But in Alabama the company has opposed the union campaign. The U.A.W. has even accused the company of using illegal tactics.
The U.A.W. has filed six charges of unfair labor practices against Mercedes with the labor relations board, saying the company disciplined employees for discussing unionization at work, prevented organizers from distributing union materials, conducted surveillance of workers and fired workers who supported the union.
Mercedes denies the claims. The company "has not interfered with or retaliated against any team member in their right to pursue union representation," it said in a statement, adding that it "firmly denies it has made any adverse employment decision based on union affiliation."
Mercedes has also raised pay in recent months and made an effort to give workers more notice about changes in their schedules, workers said. But Mr. Ellis, the activist, said the improvements had come only "because of the union knocking at the door."

G.M. to Retire Chevrolet Malibu to Make More Electric Cars: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The gasoline-powered Malibu was the last sedan sold by Chevrolet, the General Motors brand, in the United States.
General Motors said on Wednesday that it would stop making the Chevrolet Malibu, the last affordable sedan in its U.S. model lineup and a venerable nameplate that was introduced in the 1960s when the company was a dominant force in the U.S. economy.
For years, American drivers have been gravitating toward sport utility vehicles and away from sedans, compacts and hatchbacks. G.M.'s two Detroit rivals, Stellantis and Ford Motor, have also largely wiped their slates clean of cars in the United States.
Foreign automakers such as Toyota, Honda and Hyundai still sell hundreds of thousands of sedans and compacts each year, but far fewer than in previous decades when the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord ranked among the most popular vehicles on American roads. Last month, Subaru, a Japanese automaker, said it would stop making its Legacy sedan next year.
G.M. produces the Malibu at a plant in Kansas City, Kan., and will continue to manufacture the car until later this year, when it plans to retool the factory to make a new version of the Chevrolet Bolt, an electric car, and the Cadillac XT4, a luxury S.U.V.
Consumers have moved away from cars to roomier S.U.V.s and pickup trucks to haul children and recreational gear like bikes and kayaks. Automakers have helped that trend by offering more of those larger vehicles, which yield bigger profits than sedans and compacts.
The Malibu and a sporty, muscle-car version -- the Malibu SS -- were introduced in 1964. G.M. stopped making the Malibu in 1983 as the company was forced to downsize by growing foreign competition. It reintroduced the Malibu in 1997, but the model has almost always trailed the Camry and Accord in sales.
Since its introduction, G.M. has sold more than 10 million Malibus. But sales have slumped in recent years. In 2023, G.M. sold 130,000 Malibus, and deliveries fell 47 percent in the final three months of the year. A decade earlier, G.M. typically sold about 200,000 Malibus a year.
In 2023, G.M. announced that it would stop production of the Chevrolet Camaro, a sports car. It continues to make the Chevrolet Corvette. Its Cadillac brand makes two gasoline-powered sedans and has plans to start selling a high-end electric car this year. All other models that G.M. makes for the U.S. market are now trucks or S.U.V.s.
Several years ago, Ford eliminated sedans from its lineup. The Mustang is the only car that Ford makes for the U.S. market. Stellantis, the owner of Chrysler, now focuses mainly on trucks, S.U.V.s and minivans, though the company has said it will start making an electric version of its Dodge Challenger muscle car in 2025.
The Malibu could, of course, return someday, perhaps as an electric vehicle. Automakers have often resurrected and repurposed old model names, especially those that buyers remember fondly.

Full text: Scott Kidd didn't expect a terribly busy job when he became the town manager of Liberty, N.C., a onetime furniture and textile hub whose rhythms more recently centered on a yearly antiques festival.
Those quiet times, less than three years ago, soon became a whirlwind. Toyota announced it was building a battery factory on the town's rural outskirts for electric and hybrid vehicles, and since then Mr. Kidd has reviewed ordinances, met with housing developers and otherwise sought to meet the needs of a seven-million-square-foot facility.
The flurry of activity reflects new investments in a region of North Carolina that has lagged behind: the Triad. The average income in Randolph County, which includes Liberty, is $ 47,000, and some jobs at Toyota will offer an hourly wage comfortably above that. More people moving into the area could breathe life into Liberty's downtown.
But the potential dividends for the area -- which includes Greensboro, Winston-Salem and High Point, in the center of the state -- depend on equipping its workers with the skills needed for those new jobs. Mr. Kidd worried that many local workers lacked the education and skills to work at the plant.
For those jobs, "they don't write anything down -- they put it in a computer," Mr. Kidd said. "And if you don't know how to do that, you kind of get x-ed out."
At the same time, some residents and local leaders who welcome the new industries worry about maintaining the area's character, lest it become like the rapidly growing -- and expensive -- sprawls elsewhere in the South.
"We don't want to be Charlotte," said Marvin Price, executive vice president of economic development at the Greensboro Chamber of Commerce, referring to the banking center 100 miles down Interstate 85. "We want to be the best version of Greensboro."
Like many states, North Carolina has drawn on new federal and state incentives to attract more advanced manufacturing and clean technology businesses. And the Triad, built on the tobacco, textile and furniture industries, is trying to pivot toward advanced manufacturing, offering a potential blueprint to other regions whose economic engines sputtered with globalization and the rise of automation.
When it opens next year, Toyota's Liberty factory will make batteries for vehicles built in Kentucky. Ten minutes away in Siler City, Wolfspeed, a semiconductor manufacturer, is building a factory with a $ 5 billion investment. Toyota has been awarded almost $ 500 million in incentives and tax breaks from the State of North Carolina, while federal legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the CHIPS Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act have enticed investment.
"The Biden administration policies have helped North Carolina and especially the Triad become a clean energy epicenter in this country," Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, said at a recent event in Greensboro.
For decades, the Triad has been the state's manufacturing base. High Point became known as the home furnishings capital of the world, with the city and surrounding areas accounting for 60 percent of the country's furniture production at their peak. Along with furniture, Greensboro and Winston-Salem specialized in textiles and tobacco. And while the Research Triangle of Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill had renowned universities in the University of North Carolina, Duke and North Carolina State, the Triad had Wake Forest University.
But like many manufacturing regions, its fortunes started to decline in the 1970s. Jobs in textiles started being moved overseas or automated, furniture contracted with the arrival of cheaper Chinese imports, and tobacco contracted because of a decline in smoking. Mills shut down, sitting vacant for decades, and downtowns languished.
At the same time, the economy of the Triangle, which had the country's largest corporate research park, took off as research and tech companies grew. In 2001, the Research Triangle and the Triad had roughly the same economic output; by 2021, the two had diverged. Both regions gained population, but the Triangle grew faster, buoyed by growing numbers of college-educated workers.
Some industries have received a lifeline in recent years: Furniture boomed during the height of the pandemic from increased demand for home furnishings, and manufacturing has been resurging across the country. But hundreds of workers lost their jobs last year with the shuttering of several factories.
"This area of the state has found itself in a situation where it has to diversify," said Jerry Fox, an economics professor at High Point University. "This is an opportunity for people in our area to have better-paying jobs."
Signs of change are evident in downtowns. In High Point, a hosiery mill sat vacant for decades, opening only for biannual furniture showrooms. But in 2021, a group of local investors joined with the city's Chamber of Commerce and a local foundation that donated more than $ 40 million to convert the site to a co-working space, Congdon Yards. Today, it houses around 50 employers and 360 employees.
Similar projects have been undertaken in Winston-Salem and Greensboro. In downtown Winston-Salem, old cigarette factories have become the Wake Forest Innovation Quarter, a research-focused district that cost more than $ 500 million. In Greensboro, one of the city's oldest textile mills has been converted into a mixed-use complex, with amenities like a pizzeria to go along with office space.
Still, challenges remain.
One is preparing the region's workers for jobs that require different skills. Thomas Built, a bus manufacturer based in High Point since 1916, has been making electric buses over the past decade. It has nearly 2,000 employees in High Point, making it one of the city's top employers.
Kevin Bangston, the chief executive of Thomas Built, said the company had hired more than 300 workers over the past 15 months. But he has found it difficult to hire for more skilled jobs that handle automated processes in the factory.
"Demand is very high for those positions, and supply is very low," Mr. Bangston said.
Key to that transition is the role of work force development programs, which involve partnerships between businesses and community colleges to provide the skills to work in advanced manufacturing.
One school offering such training is Guilford Technical Community College, the site of Mr. Cooper's Greensboro appearance. At the same event, Jill Biden, the first lady, highlighted what she saw as the importance of such programs to enacting President Biden's economic agenda.
The school offers apprenticeships, enabling students to work while earning an associate degree. One program, designed by Toyota, aims to qualify workers for jobs at the company.
Devante Cuthbertson, 28, grew up in Greensboro and was working for a flooring company around 30 minutes away as a machine operator, but he left that job in 2023 to join the apprenticeship program at Guilford Tech. There, he takes classes twice a week and goes to the Toyota battery plant site three times a week for an apprenticeship program, applying classroom learning about electricity, motor controls and the components of car batteries.
"I wanted to ensure I had an education," said Mr. Cuthbertson, who said he intended to apply for a job at Toyota as a maintenance technician when he graduates in 2025.
Anthony Clarke, the president of Guilford Tech, said the arrival of Toyota -- with the promise of high-paying jobs -- had boosted interest in the school's programs.
"Any time employers stand up and say, 'Hey, we've got really good-paying jobs,' students pay attention to that, and they flock to that," Dr. Clarke said.
Economic development leaders and elected officials have cited the area's affordability as a draw for companies and workers alike, particularly as housing costs have skyrocketed nationally. According to Zillow, the average home valuation in the Triad's three main cities is around $ 250,000, compared with more than $ 300,000 for the state as a whole and more than $ 400,000 in the Triangle.
The Triad has become a destination for some college-educated workers leaving coastal cities. Along with her husband, who worked for Nike, Melissa Binder left Portland, Ore., in 2019 for Winston-Salem to raise their child. They bought their house for $ 315,000 in 2019, and Ms. Binder said it offered more space than the house they owned in Portland.
After renting in New York's West Village for several years, Julia and Ryan Hennessee knew they wanted a home to raise a family. In 2018, they chose Winston-Salem to be close to Mr. Hennessee's family and bought a single-family home for $ 445,000.
The Hennessees said they welcomed the growth offered by the arrival of companies like Toyota. At the same time, they want Winston-Salem to retain the smaller-town charm that drew them to the region -- as well as the cost of living -- and not become like other Southern cities.
"Winston knows how it's different from a place like Atlanta, and doesn't have aspirations of becoming that," Ms. Hennessee said.
But for others in the Triad, particularly in more rural parts like Liberty, the transition could prove more challenging.
Brenda Hornsby Heindl, a librarian in Liberty, said the Toyota plant could improve the town's fortunes. But primary education in the county remains underfunded, she said, and literacy levels are lower than the state average.
"While my goal for the future of our community is that anyone could apply as an engineer at Toyota, right now we've got adults and kids that couldn't read an application," Ms. Hornsby Heindl said. "It's going to take more than Toyota to have that happen."

Shelley Duvall Vanished From Hollywood. She’s Been Here the Whole Time.

AUSTIN, Texas — On a winding back road of Texas Hill Country, Shelley Duvall pulled over and lit another cigarette.
“How did you like Egypt?” she called out from the white Toyota 4Runner she spends most of her days in, and some nights, much to the chagrin of her partner, Dan Gilroy. The “Egypt” she referred to is an industrial site one passes on the way into the small town that Duvall has called home for more than a decade, its piles of sand and gravel, glimpsed at speed, resembling the ancient pyramids.
She cracked a grin, revving the engine. “Next stop: Santa Fe!” she announced before vanishing down the road in a cloud of dust.
To follow Duvall, 74, on the road and in conversation, is to enter into powerfully imaginative realms. Stories that begin in a certain direction have a habit of taking the scenic route, and, occasionally, swerving excitingly off-piste. One minute she might be talking in depth about shooting the horror film “The Shining” or the high jinks from the cast on the “Popeye” set, and the next she’s recalling lyrics from songs — all while retrieving crumpled headshots and cast photographs from a Ziploc bag she keeps in the SUV’s glove compartment.
Because of health issues, including diabetes and an injured foot that has greatly impacted her mobility, Duvall often stays in her 4Runner, some days driving to local nature spots, catching up with people in town and visiting drive-thrus.
For more than two decades, Duvall’s career was at a standstill. Her last film role had come in 2002’s “Manna From Heaven,” after which she retired for reasons that have remained a mystery from a varied and, by most counts, successful career as both an actor and producer. Among the most common questions that show up when you search her name these days: What happened to Shelley Duvall? Why did Shelley Duvall disappear?
This enduring curiosity is unsurprising: The very act of fading into obscurity, be it voluntary or forced, is at the heart of the “Hollywood recluse” trope, which never ceases to intrigue.
It intrigues Shelley Duvall as well.
“I was a star; I had leading roles,” she said, solemnly shaking her head. She had parked in the town square for a takeout lunch — chicken salad, quiche and sweetened iced coffee, finished off with a drag of a Parliament. She lowered her voice. “People think it’s just aging, but it’s not. It’s violence.”
Prompted to explain “violence,” Duvall responded with a question:
“How would you feel if people were really nice, and then, suddenly, on a dime” — she snapped her fingers — “they turn on you? You would never believe it unless it happens to you. That’s why you get hurt, because you can’t really believe it’s true.”
“Everyone’s always interested in downfall stories,” said Gilroy, 76, her partner of more than 30 years, who helps her get in and out of her car and sometimes has to plead with her to come back into the house. His voice bore a tone of weariness in discussing the speculation and gossip that still surrounds Duvall.
“It’s all over the internet: ‘Look at her now’ and ‘You won’t believe what she looks like now.’ Every celebrity gets that treatment,” Gilroy said.
He has reason to feel weary, of course: In 2016, Duvall was a guest on the daytime talk show “Dr. Phil,” with the rare television appearance proving to be personally disastrous. Still controversial, the episode showed Duvall in a state of distress.
“I’m very sick. I need help,” Duvall told Dr. Phil in one clip. He responded: “Well, that’s why I’m here.”
The episode was titled “A Hollywood Star’s Descent Into Mental Illness: Saving ‘The Shining’’s Shelley Duvall.” Wide-eyed, Duvall went on to utter a slew of bizarre statements, such as claiming to be receiving messages from Robin Williams, who had died two years before, and talking about malevolent forces who were out to do her harm. Although the show’s stated aim was one of empowerment and destigmatizing mental illness, many, including Stanley Kubrick’s daughter Vivian, publicly criticized the show for being exploitative and sensationalist.
Although the episode never aired in full, the damage was done . It led to questions regarding her mental state, and she withdrew further into herself.
“It did nothing for her,” Gilroy said of the show. “It just put her on the map as an oddity.”
Duvall, born in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1949 to Robert and Bobbie Duvall, who worked in law and real estate, had a performative streak. Growing up the oldest and only daughter of four children, Duvall had always been headstrong.
Although Duvall lacked formal training, or certain qualities you might expect of a traditional leading lady, her rawness worked to her advantage. For one thing, she didn’t look or carry herself like a classic Hollywood starlet. She brought an energy to her roles that jarred with the studied naturalism that was the acting style at the time, her voice had a beguiling singsong quality to it, and she had a talent for improvisation.
Although these days it is rare for actresses to show their age on or off screen, Duvall has aged naturally. With her fine gray hair, the Duvall of today cuts a strikingly different figure to the waif who bewitched filmgoers throughout the ’70s and ’80s.
But her smile is still expressive and kind, her wispy eyebrows often arching to emphasize certain points, to make the listener laugh and win them over. She has an almost cartoonish physicality, with doleful eyes and a goofy humor. This was the woman who once dated Paul Simon and Ringo Starr and worked with some of the era’s most famous directors: Robert Altman, Terry Gilliam and Kubrick among them.
Her disappearance wasn’t, as it had been rumored , born of a protracted breakdown caused years before by her treatment on the set of “The Shining.” In fact, she continues to have only good things to say about that intense yearlong shoot in London and her admiration for Kubrick . Instead, the pause may be more accurately, though not definitively, attributed to the emotional impact of two events: the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which damaged her Los Angeles home, and the stressful toll of one of her brothers falling ill, which prompted her return to her native Texas three decades ago.
It could also equally be attributed to the curse of fame: It isn’t enough to be famous; one must continuously stoke the fire. Leave it for too long, especially if you begin to “age out” as a woman in the industry, and a career will wane.
In 1982, two years after “The Shining” made her a household name, Duvall started her own production company, Platypus, creating television shows for children, most notably “Faerie Tale Theatre.”
Never intending to become an actor, Duvall said she owed her career to Altman, an acclaimed director who cast her in her first role in his 1970 dark comedy, “Brewster McCloud,” after she met two of his producers at a party when she was 20.
“He was real fatherly,” she said of Altman. “Sometimes too much so. He was like the old lady who lived in the shoe, who had too many children she didn’t know what to do, you know?”
The pair became close friends and would go on to collaborate on seven movies, including “Nashville,” “Thieves Like Us,” “McCabe & Mrs. Miller,” “Popeye” and “3 Women,” for which Duvall won the 1977 best actress award at Cannes.
“I thought: Boy , if it’s this easy, why doesn’t everybody act?” she said.
After more than two decades, Duvall is set to make a return to movies this spring in “The Forest Hills.”
Duvall plays Mama, the mother of Rico (Chiko Mendez), a man who, according to the film’s logline, is “tormented by nightmarish visions after enduring head trauma.” The film also features Edward Furlong (“Terminator 2”), another actor who has spent a long time away from the spotlight.
Asked how she came to be involved in the project, Duvall shrugged: “I wanted to act again. And then this guy kept calling, and so I wound up doing it.”
Despite her decadeslong disappearance, Duvall’s filmography has thrived. Instagram users regularly source new Shelley material from an apparently bottomless archival trove.
“Hello, I’m Shelley Duvall,” a line Duvall would utter as she presented each episode of “Faerie Tale Theatre,” is sampled ad nauseam in posts. Yet there are no books, no documentaries, no star on the Walk of Fame. Seemingly dismissed and forgotten by the filmmaking establishment, she has become a cult figure for the quirky, the alternative and the misunderstood — and they seem to want to protect her, and her legacy, making their own podcasts and films.
“I think she’s pretty relatable, like, she kind of came from nothing,” said Sarah Lukowski, 23, an Austin-based copywriter who runs a popular Instagram account devoted to all things Shelley Duvall. “She was such an enigmatic force.”

Are E.V.s Too Quiet and 'Boring'?: [Letter]

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "Electric Cars Are Boring," by Ezra Dyer (Opinion guest essay, April 13):
If E.V.s are boring, I guess I am OK with being bored. As an E.V. owner, I no longer have to stop at the gas station to fill up in all kinds of (Chicago) weather. No more oil changes, no more antifreeze concerns, no muffler or fuel pump problems. Boring is good.
No key or fob to carry, and I can preheat or precool my E.V. in various types of inclement weather.
Now for full disclosure. I bought my first E.V. 10 years ago when I was 73. I am now at the age where simpler (boring) is better. I still drive my grandson's stick shift from time to time, but find it requires too much effort.
I was wondering if Mr. Dyer would like to go back to the horse and buggy. Just think of the road noise and the sound of real horses.
Ron Thomas
Glencoe, Ill.
To the Editor:
The slowdown in E.V. sales is not because they are boring. It's because they are 1) too expensive; 2) take too long to charge; 3) don't go far enough on a single charge.
I will happily buy a medium-size S.U.V. E.V. when it goes 500 miles on a five-minute charge and costs about the same as the hybrid version. Until then I will settle for the Toyota RAV4 hybrid.
John Aitken
Salt Lake City
To the Editor:
Sitting on the back deck of my house, I can hear the faint roar of traffic from the town center, about a mile away. I console myself that when more people are driving E.V.s, quiet and the sweet cacophony of bird song will prevail.
Now, Ezra Dyer tells us that E.V. manufacturers are designing speaker systems that will mimic the sound of "loud exhaust" because E.V.s are too boring.
What's next, E.V.s equipped to spew the nostalgia-inducing "not entirely unpleasant" smell of gas, oil and diesel?
The genius of human invention never fails to amaze and horrify.
Janet Buchwald
Sudbury, Mass.
To the Editor:
What an unexpected and incredibly refreshing surprise to see the essay on electric cars by Ezra Dyer, a Car and Driver columnist. As a longtime Car and Driver subscriber and past and present owner of three Alfa Romeos, I agree wholeheartedly with his observations.
And given the fact that the Porsche 911 GT3 is one of the most coveted cars by my 25-year-old son, there is hope for the next generation. We just need the car manufacturers to listen to the roar.

Living With Roommates in College
To the Editor:
Re "Living With a Stranger Is Hard. College Students Should Try It," by Pamela Paul (column, April 23):
I had the unique privilege of having roommates for my first two years of college who were radically different from me. I learned an awful lot because of the experience. But there was plenty I wish I hadn't too.
The move to college is hard enough -- academically, socially, mentally -- that sharing that with another person places a needless burden on new students.
Ms. Paul is quite right that students benefit from learning from those around them, and schools should emphasize this in the classroom. But if there's one place that ought to be sacred and free from the trials of starting college, it should be one's room.
James J. Bernstein
New York
To the Editor:
When I arrived at the University of Alaska Fairbanks as a freshman in 1972 as a Jewish New Yorker in a distant land, I met my new roommate, a Muslim from the Philippines. Two people could not have been more different. And it worked out magically.
While we have lost touch over the years, I still remember his glowing smile and warmth and am glad we were selected as roommates. It helped me to grow and appreciate people from vastly different backgrounds.
Randomness in roommate selection can generate growth and learning, which is what I always thought college is supposed to do.

Tech in the Classroom
To the Editor:
Re "Tech in Schools Needs 'a Hard Reset,"' by Jessica Grose (Opinion, April 28):
Over the past 15 years of having school-age kids, I have been deeply frustrated by how our schools have adopted technology without enough scrutiny. It is depressing to realize how many hours my kids are required to spend in front of the computer screen daily -- and all without any body of evidence pointing to its positive effect on learning.
How I dreamed about running the iPad over with my van after four years of my high schooler reading everything -- even novels! -- on his device.
Though I've heard noble rationales for tech in the classrooms -- "It will save the trees!" -- I agree with Ms. Grose that schools need to re-evaluate what tech companies decide the schools need.
Not only are standardized tests at every level revealing faltering learning outcomes, but the human-to-human interaction is also clearly suffering the most. Out with Google Slides; in with teaching!

'Unpleasant Truths' About Russia
To the Editor:
Re "How Do I Talk to My Son About a War I Don't Understand?," by Sasha Vasilyuk (Opinion guest essay, April 28):
The war in Ukraine is not "Russia's betrayal," as Ms. Vasilyuk writes, but Russia's business as usual. For generations, Moscow has violently suppressed the freedoms of surrounding nations.
Rather than withhold unpleasant truths, Russian parents must teach their children what Ukrainian, Polish or Latvian children learn from theirs: Historically Russia is an aggressor.
Russia's imperialism relies on the unquestioned belief among countless ordinary Russians that their state has a virtuous right to dominate its neighbors. Without much hard work by parents and teachers, Russia's noxious record will continue unchallenged.
John Connelly
Kensington, Calif.
The writer is a professor of history at the University of California, Berkeley.
Water and Politics
To the Editor:
Re "Democrats See Water as Issue to Win Over Rural Arizona Voters" (news article, April 24):
This article points out the difficulty that Democrats face in winning over conservative voters. For these desert communities, water is a life and death issue. But even though they admit that Republican policies hurt them and Democratic policies help them, these people will vote for Donald Trump.
And it's not as if they don't realize which side is which. They may agree that on this crucial issue the Democrats are right and are helping them, and the Republicans are wrong and are hurting them, but it doesn't matter. They will still vote for Mr. Trump. There could be no clearer example of people voting directly against their own interests.
If nothing else, this discouraging story shows how much stronger is the fear of migrants, of change, of big government -- all abstract fears really -- than the drastic reality staring these people in the face.

At the Crossroads of Domesticity and Desire: [Style Desk]

Full text: It was not exactly urgent to get the rug, but the larger question the rug had to answer was urgent enough. That's why, on a bright afternoon at the end of March, Miranda July and I were driving toward Irvine, Calif., where she planned to meet a man about a listing on Facebook Marketplace.
She had recently moved out of the large home she shared with her husband and child in Silver Lake and into a small two-bedroom house behind her writing studio in Echo Park. It meant she needed new things for a new place. A toilet, for example. A coral one, ideally, to match the tub and sink. Flooring for the kitchen. A refrigerator. And an antique carpet for the walk-in closet she was fixing up in her studio space. In this new life, would it all fit together?
Ms. July, a writer, filmmaker and artist whose work plays with the boundaries of intimacy, was wearing round tortoiseshell sunglasses, and her hair was pulled back in a velvet bow. We were just getting acquainted as she carefully merged on and off a series of highways in her blue Toyota Prius. Irvine was more than an hour away. There was going to be traffic -- of course there would be traffic -- and it began to dawn on us that this was going to be a long drive.
In such close quarters, Ms. July suggested we might define the terms of our relationship more clearly.
"What if you just said what the premise was of each thing you were entering into, and both people said their take on it?" she said. "Like even today, in the car. It could be like: 'What's your sense of this? Do you think we're going to get hungry? What are our bodily concerns? Is there something you need to get back to?'
"There are a lot of basic things we could've discussed that actually may have made everything easier and clearer, you know?" she added, laughing. "We have yet to see what anxieties are to come!"
I felt my stomach flip, but she had a point. I was unbearably thirsty, for one. Suddenly, it seemed absurd we had left these things unsaid, and a relief someone had brought them up. Now we could really talk.
The characters in Ms. July's films and books are often hoping for some kind of breakthrough. They go about their daily routines, longing for someone to say that unspoken thing. Maybe they're on the brink of being truly understood.
In her new novel, "All Fours," the unnamed female narrator -- a 45-year-old "semifamous" artist who shares some biographical details with Ms. July -- considers that a cross-country road trip from Los Angeles to New York could be a turning point in her life.
She doesn't get very far. About 30 minutes in, she checks into a motel and spends the next two and a half weeks redecorating her room, taking up with a younger, married man and contemplating a totally different way of living. When she returns home to her family, she realizes she can't quite reacclimate to the old domestic rhythms.
As she confronts what seems like the imminent death of pleasure, foretold by a graph about hormonal changes she finds online, she sees no choice but to strike out into new territory. Masturbation, fantasies of sex and plenty of actual sex help propel her onward.
The heroine of "All Fours" is not a woman in a midlife crisis, but -- in the epic, Dante-esque sense -- a woman in the "middle of her life," Ms. July said. She found that little else had been written about this phase, particularly about perimenopause, the transitional time before full-fledged menopause.
The existential quandaries raised in the book -- Can the world accommodate the idea of an ever-changing self? How do you reconcile your desires (sexual, creative and otherwise) with your circumstances? -- are ones the author has been tangling with in her own life.
In an Instagram post a few summers ago, Ms. July announced that she and her husband, the filmmaker Mike Mills, were no longer in a romantic relationship, although they were still living together most of the time to parent their child, Hopper, who was 10 at the time.
"We feel good about this twisteroo in our long story and await further twists and turns over the course of our lives," she wrote beneath a photo of her standing barefoot in front of three pairs of shoes. The next slide is a video of her dancing in her underwear to Ol' Dirty Bastard's "Got Your Money."
The post, Ms. July said, had been "carefully worded."
"Mike and I are public enough -- just barely recognizable enough, to some very small sliver of the population -- that one of us out with our girlfriends in New York could, to some people's eyes, look like we're cheating or something," she said in the car.
Ms. July, who recently turned 50, is aware that readers may conflate the protagonist in "All Fours" with herself. The notion that her work is autobiographical has followed her since she wrote, directed and starred in "Me and You and Everyone We Know," which won the Caméra d'Or at Cannes in 2005, when she was 31. And she sometimes inflects her characters with her own habits or ailments -- like the passing throat condition she embellished and gave to the protagonist of her last novel, "The First Bad Man." But she says she never intended them to be her avatars.
In the new book, she has borrowed a bit more from life. "The only way I can put it really is 'closer to the bone,"' she said. "But it is still fiction."
"All Fours" grew out of a story Ms. July published in The New Yorker in 2017, "The Metal Bowl." It continued to take shape when she spoke to other women about how they were dealing with this stage in their lives.
"I remember driving and talking to Miranda about marriage, talking to her about sex," said the writer Sheila Heti, a close friend of Ms. July's who read an early draft of "All Fours." "I remember feeling that she was trying to map the world through her conversations with people; she was interested in hidden desires, in the desires we can't quite articulate to ourselves or are afraid to."
Ms. July had similar conversations early in the pandemic with the sculptor Isabelle Albuquerque -- to whom the novel is dedicated -- sometimes on long walks, sometimes while they sat 10 feet apart in Ms. July's backyard, "yelling across the void," as Ms. Albuquerque put it.
"Sometimes it felt like we were trying to create a new society," she said. "We were talking about the ideas but also trying to live them. Trying to make adjustments to our lives that would allow us to have a kind of freedom we both really crave."
They conducted various experiments together. Living by their infradian rhythms, including their menstrual cycles. Spending one night a week at their studios, away from their partners. Ms. July kept that up for years. She had Wednesdays.
The challenge wasn't to blow up your life. It was to set off tiny bombs all the time. Maybe no one even noticed but you. It could be as small as clenching your fist.
The entire world should probably be reorganized in a more feminist way, Ms. July said, but "the micro, everyday version is like, What can we do right now?"
The Rug
Ms. July pulled into a parking lot of an affluent residential complex. In search of the rug merchant, we wandered past tennis courts and a pool.
Just as she called him on her phone, the man appeared. He introduced himself as Gino Gucciano and pointed down the street, toward a house around the corner.
He strode off, and we went back to the Prius.
"Are you ready for things to be maximum weird?" Ms. July said.
After the short drive from the parking lot to Mr. Gucciano's house, we found that the garage door was open, revealing a vast collection of carpets. Standing beside a stack, Ms. July vetoed the one she had come to see, which was listed for $ 600. "Too brown."
"If there are ones that had pinks. ..." Ms. July said, taking a closer look.
Mr. Gucciano and a business partner, Sam Hossaini, unfurled several more on the floor of the garage. Some were too big, though Ms. July discovered she had not written down the measurements for the room in her studio where the rug would end up.
At last, they rolled out a deep rose Persian rug, laying it across the lawn in the sun. It was 150 years old, they said. The price was $ 2,600.
"So if I just Venmoed you $ 1,000 right now, that's not going to cut it?" Ms. July asked.
"Unfortunately, no," Mr. Gucciano said. "We paid more for it than that. It's hard to get them that old."
"At the thousand level for me, that's -- I have a whole home to figure out," Ms. July said. "You know, I just got divorced. I have to quickly make a home."
"Yeah, I went through that five years ago," Mr. Gucciano said. "I lost a lot, and my home. But I have my kids, so I'm happy."
"Oh, OK, yeah."
"I want to make you happy, Miranda," Mr. Gucciano said. "But we paid a little more than a thousand for it."
Ms. July offered to tag them on Instagram, where she has been sporadically chronicling her sometimes comical efforts at home improvement in a highlight reel she calls "MJHGTV."
Mr. Gucciano and Mr. Hossaini deliberated. They had just started an Instagram page for their business that very day. They knocked down the price to $ 1,300.
Ms. July began recording on her phone. She reviewed the pros and cons of the different rugs, until she turned to the pink one, the winner. The two men hauled it into the trunk of Prius.
"We have a lot to debrief," Ms. July said, once she was behind the wheel again.
On the ride back to Echo Park, she admitted that she hadn't meant to blurt out that she was divorced. It wasn't quite true -- she was in the middle of mediation.
"It's a big piece of information, given how little information I'm giving about us," she said. "And I actually think every divorce is different, and the reasons for doing it are very specific."
In "All Fours," the protagonist and her husband try out a new arrangement, which evolves throughout the novel. He is only one of the people she has sex with; and she never does consummate her emotional fling with the young man who sets off her quest.
Whether the marriage survives these evolutions is ambiguous. At the end of the book, the narrator is walking by herself, now awed rather than panicked by life's curveballs.
"I really love where the book ends, because it's fairly open-ended, and I actually still have that open-ended feeling," Ms. July said. "And so I guess I hate to sort of take away from it."
A Studio of Her Own
The next day, I visited Ms. July at her studio, which, together with her new home directly behind it, forms a sort of "compound," she likes to say.
Her artist friend Nico B. Young was working in the garage, sawing a countertop and some shelving for Ms. July's kitchen that he had designed himself. Almost every surface had been covered in a light yellow mixture of epoxy resin and pigment, making each cabinet resemble a perfect stick of butter.
A pair of 20-pound dumbbells lay just outside on the concrete, where Ms. July exercises with a trainer twice a week, beneath an orange tree in blossom.
She nimbly lifted the rug out of the car and into her studio, which is cluttered with hundreds of books, along with ephemera from her movies and other projects. In the main room is the long table where she writes, sitting on a hard wooden chair. Often when she works, she locks her phone in a box and unplugs the Wi-Fi. During breaks, she sometimes dances.
Down a hall is a bedroom where she now keeps much of her wardrobe of mainly vintage and thrifted clothes. She thought this might be the right place for the rug, giving the space a Parisian feel, maybe. But it was too big. It curled up against the wall, ever so slightly.
We tried sliding it around.
"Maybe if I got a rug pad, it would sort of rest on the edge," Ms. July said.
We left the rug to settle and sat across from each other at her writing table.
Throughout "All Fours," the protagonist is often grounded by her best friend, a sculptor named Jordi who, toward the end of the book, unveils a sculpture of a headless woman on her hands and knees. "Everyone thinks doggy style is so vulnerable," Jordi says. But, she explains, the position is actually quite stable: "It's hard to be knocked down when you're on all fours."
Ms. July told me she was excited to have women over to her new place for a party after her book tour, when things calm down. She wanted to spool a string of lights connecting the home she shares with Hopper and her work studio. The guests would float between the two.
"I'm kind of just looking forward to having time to just enjoy the world that I've made for myself," she said. "A lot of steps along the way were hard and scary, and so it's not that everything to come is going to be easy."
"But now I'm not the person who has to write that book," she said. "I'm the person who wrote it."

LOS ANGELES — It was not exactly urgent to get the rug, but the larger question the rug had to answer was urgent enough. That’s why, on a bright afternoon at the end of March, Miranda July and I were driving toward Irvine, California, where she planned to meet a man about a listing on Facebook Marketplace.
She had recently moved out of the large home she shared with her husband and child in Silver Lake and into a small two-bedroom house behind her writing studio in Echo Park.

“I remember driving and talking to Miranda about marriage, talking to her about sex,” said writer Sheila Heti, a close friend who read an early draft of “All Fours.” “I remember feeling that she was trying to map the world through her conversations with people; she was interested in hidden desires, in the desires we can’t quite articulate to ourselves or are afraid to.”
July had similar conversations early in the pandemic with sculptor Isabelle Albuquerque — to whom the novel is dedicated — sometimes on long walks, sometimes while they sat 10 feet apart in July’s backyard, “yelling across the void,” as Albuquerque put it.
“Sometimes it felt like we were trying to create a new society,” she said. “We were talking about the ideas but also trying to live them. Trying to make adjustments to our lives that would allow us to have a kind of freedom we both really crave.”
They conducted various experiments together. Living by their infradian rhythms, including their menstrual cycles. Spending one night a week at their studios, away from their partners. July kept that up for years. She had Wednesdays.
The challenge wasn’t to blow up your life. It was to set off tiny bombs all the time. Maybe no one even noticed but you. It could be as small as clenching your fist.
The entire world should probably be reorganized in a more feminist way, July said, but “the micro, everyday version is like, What can we do right now?”
The Rug
July pulled into a parking lot of an affluent residential complex. In search of the rug merchant, we wandered past tennis courts and a pool.
Just as she called him on her phone, the man appeared. He introduced himself as Gino Gucciano and pointed down the street, toward a house around the corner. Then he strode off, and we went back to the Prius.
“Are you ready for things to be maximum weird?” July said.
At Gucciano’s house, we found the garage door open, revealing a vast collection of carpets. Standing beside a stack, July vetoed the one she had come to see, which was listed for $600. “Too brown.”
“If there are ones that had pinks ...” July said, taking a closer look.
Gucciano and a business partner, Sam Hossaini, unfurled several more on the floor of the garage. Some were too big, though July realized she had not written down the measurements for the room in her studio where the rug would end up.
At last, they rolled out a deep rose Persian rug, laying it across the lawn in the sun. It was 150 years old, they said. The price was $2,600.
“So if I just Venmoed you $1,000 right now, that’s not going to cut it?” July asked.
“Unfortunately, no,” Gucciano said. “We paid more for it than that. It’s hard to get them that old.”
“At the thousand level for me, that’s — I have a whole home to figure out,” July said. “You know, I just got divorced. I have to quickly make a home.”
“Yeah, I went through that five years ago,” Gucciano said. “I lost a lot, and my home. But I have my kids, so I’m happy.”
“Oh, OK, yeah.”
“I want to make you happy, Miranda,” Gucciano said. “But we paid a little more than a thousand for it.”
July offered to tag them on Instagram, where she has been sporadically chronicling her sometimes comical efforts at home improvement in a highlight reel she calls “MJHGTV.”
Gucciano and Hossaini deliberated. They had just started an Instagram page for their business that very day. They knocked down the price to $1,300.
July began recording on her phone. She reviewed the pros and cons of the different rugs, until she turned to the pink one, the winner. The two men hauled it into the Prius’ trunk.
“We have a lot to debrief,” July said, once she was behind the wheel again.
On the ride back to Echo Park, she admitted that she hadn’t meant to blurt out that she was divorced. It wasn’t quite true — she was in the middle of mediation.
“It’s a big piece of information, given how little information I’m giving about us,” she said. “And I actually think every divorce is different, and the reasons for doing it are very specific.”
In “All Fours,” the protagonist and her husband try out a new arrangement, which evolves throughout the novel. He is only one of the people she has sex with; and she never does consummate her emotional fling with the young man who sets off her quest.
Whether the marriage survives these evolutions is ambiguous. At the end of the book, the narrator is walking by herself, now awed rather than panicked by life’s curveballs.
“I really love where the book ends, because it’s fairly open-ended, and I actually still have that open-ended feeling,” July said. “And so I guess I hate to sort of take away from it.”
A Studio of Her Own
The next day, I visited July at her studio, which, together with her new home directly behind it, forms a sort of “compound,” she likes to say.
Her artist friend Nico B. Young was working in the garage, sawing a countertop and some shelving for July’s kitchen that he had designed himself. Almost every surface had been covered in a light yellow mixture of epoxy resin and pigment, making each cabinet resemble a perfect stick of butter.
July nimbly lifted the rug out of the car and into her studio, which is cluttered with hundreds of books, along with ephemera from her movies and other projects. In the main room is the long table where she writes, sitting on a hard wooden chair. Often when she works, she locks her phone in a box and unplugs the Wi-Fi. During breaks, she sometimes dances.
Down a hall is a bedroom where she now keeps much of her wardrobe of mainly vintage clothes. She thought this might be the right place for the rug, giving the space a Parisian feel, maybe. But it was too big. It curled up against the wall, ever so slightly.
We tried sliding it around.
“Maybe if I got a rug pad, it would sort of rest on the edge,” July said.
We left the rug to settle and sat across from each other at her writing table.
Throughout “All Fours,” the protagonist is often grounded by her best friend, a sculptor named Jordi who, toward the end of the book, unveils a sculpture of a headless woman on her hands and knees. “Everyone thinks doggy style is so vulnerable,” Jordi says. But, she explains, the position is actually quite stable: “It’s hard to be knocked down when you’re on all fours.”
July told me she was excited to have women over to her new place for a party after her book tour, when things calm down. She wanted to spool a string of lights connecting the home she shares with Hopper and her work studio. The guests would float between the two.
“I’m kind of just looking forward to having time to just enjoy the world that I’ve made for myself,” she said. “A lot of steps along the way were hard and scary, and so it’s not that everything to come is going to be easy.”
“But now I’m not the person who has to write that book,” she said. “I’m the person who wrote it.”

Full text: The killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh nationalist who had sought a separate state in India and was viewed as a terrorist by New Delhi, set off diplomatic tensions between Canada and India.
Three Indian men were charged in the brazen slaying of a Sikh separatist on Canadian soil, the police said on Friday, a killing that set off a diplomatic clash with New Delhi after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau blamed "agents of the government of India" for orchestrating the shooting.
India's government called the claim "absurd" and took steps that led Canada to withdraw more than 40 of its diplomats from the country. But amid the denials, Canada said it had a "smoking gun," supported by information from the United States. And a federal indictment in New York linked the Indian government to another murder-for-hire-plot against another Sikh separatist.
The three men were arrested in Edmonton, Alberta, and charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the killing of the Sikh nationalist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in June, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. The suspects -- Karan Brar, 22; Kamalpreet Singh, 22; and Karanpreet Singh, 28 -- had been living in Canada for three to five years but were not permanent residents of Canada, the police said.
"This investigation does not end here," Superintendent Mandeep Mooker, head of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team for the Mounties, said at a news conference on Friday. "We are aware that others may have played a role in this homicide, and we remain dedicated to finding and arresting each one of these individuals."
Several other investigations are ongoing, including into any possible involvement by the Indian government in Mr. Nijjar's killing, Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said at the news conference. He also said, without providing further details, that the relationship with India in investigating the killing had been challenging.
The Indian government did not immediately comment on the arrests.
The arrests were the culmination of an investigation into a shooting that shocked Canada and put Sikhs in the country on edge. Over the past year, the Canadian police investigating Mr. Nijjar's death had released little information on their progress, other than a map outlining the getaway vehicle's route and some grainy images of the assailants' silver Toyota Camry.
Mr. Nijjar, 45, was in the parking lot of the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, where he had been president, when three masked men ambushed and shot him dead on June 18.
A Canadian citizen, he was born in Punjab and moved to Canada in the heat of India's crackdown on Sikh leaders in the 1990s, according to Indian news reports. He had been a leader in the local Khalistan movement, which has long sought a separate Sikh nation that includes the northern Indian state of Punjab. Surrey, a city outside Vancouver, is home to one of the largest Sikh populations in Canada.
The Indian government has labeled Mr. Nijjar as a terrorist and had called for his arrest. And the Mounties had warned Mr. Nijjar and several other Sikhs about threats to their lives.
During a foreign-interference inquiry last month established to investigate allegations that India and China had interfered in Canadian elections, Jagmeet Singh, leader of the federal New Democratic Party who represents a British Columbia district, testified that he, too had been warned by the police of potential threats against his life.
The public killing of Mr. Nijjar heightened diplomatic tensions between Canada and India after Mr. Trudeau bluntly accused India of being behind the killing. He said he had based his accusation on intelligence gathered by the Canadian government.
Though the United States was wary of undermining its relations with India, which it sees as an important global partner, U.S. intelligence agencies had offered their Canadian counterparts information that helped Canada reach that conclusion. But allied officials said that Canada itself had hit upon the intercepted communications of Indian diplomats in Canada indicating involvement in the plot.
Mr. Trudeau told the House of Commons in September that he had "in no uncertain terms" raised India's suspected involvement in the shooting directly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India at the Group of 20 summit that month.
The Indian government strongly denied the accusation, and threatened to revoke the immunity of 41 Canadian diplomats in India, forcing Canada to withdraw two-thirds of its diplomats based in that country. Mélanie Joly, the Canadian foreign minister, said that India's move violated international law, and that Canada would temporarily close three consulates there.
In November, federal prosecutors in Manhattan revealed what they said was a separate murder-for-hire plot in the United States against another Sikh activist. A federal indictment filed in Manhattan accused an Indian national in a scheme targeting Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a dual American and Canadian citizen living in New York who has been outspoken in calling for a Sikh-majority homeland.
The plot had been organized by an Indian government official who was also involved in the killing of Mr. Nijjar, according to the unsealed indictment. Nikhil Gupta, an Indian national, was later arrested in the Czech Republic in connection with the U.S. scheme. Mr. Gupta had boasted of his criminal links to an undercover agent who he thought was an assassin and offered him $ 100,000, officials said.
In December, sources told The Globe and Mail, a Canadian newspaper, that arrests were imminent. But the passing months had left some concerned that the anniversary of Mr. Nijjar's death would go by without a resolution.
"We would not be at this point without the bravery and the courage of the Sikh community coming forward," Superintendent Mooker said at the news conference. He also said that the police would release photos of the three suspects to gather more information about their presence in Surrey at the time of the shooting.
Posters celebrating Mr. Nijjar, who members of the temple view as a martyr for the Khalistani cause, are still displayed throughout and around the building. Dozens of people gathered for a community lunch on Friday afternoon, and to hear an update from the temple's leaders, who said in an official statement that they were committed to furthering the causes that Mr. Nijjar "laid his life for."
But Balpreet Singh Boparai, a Toronto-based lawyer at the World Sikh Organization of Canada, said the arrests announced on Friday would most likely provide little comfort to Sikhs there if those implicated in the killing and other interference activities were not also held accountable.
"We just hope that Canada has the guts to be transparent and identify those individuals who are behind this plot," he said.

Long Out of Sight, Ever on Fans' Minds: [Style Desk]

Full text: On a winding back road of Texas Hill Country, Shelley Duvall pulled over and lit another cigarette.
"How did you like Egypt?" she called out from the white Toyota 4Runner she spends most of her days in, and some nights, much to the chagrin of her partner, Dan Gilroy. The "Egypt" she referred to is an industrial site one passes on the way into the small town Ms. Duvall has called home for more than a decade, its piles of sand and gravel, glimpsed at speed, resembling the ancient pyramids.
She cracked a grin, revving the engine. "Next stop: Santa Fe!" she announced before vanishing down the road in a cloud of dust.
To follow Ms. Duvall, 74, on the road and in conversation, is to enter into powerfully imaginative realms. Stories that begin in a certain direction have a habit of taking the scenic route, and, occasionally, swerving excitingly off-piste. One minute she might be talking in depth about shooting the horror film "The Shining" or the high jinks from the cast on the "Popeye" set, and the next she's recalling lyrics from songs -- all while retrieving crumpled headshots and cast photographs from a Ziploc bag she keeps in the SUV's glove compartment.
Because of health issues, including diabetes and an injured foot that has greatly impacted her mobility ("My left one, like that Daniel Day-Lewis movie," she joked), Ms. Duvall often stays in her 4Runner, some days driving to local nature spots, catching up with people in town and visiting drive-throughs. The driver's seat is the only open space, as the interior is cluttered with takeout cartons and empty coffee cups.
For more than two decades, Ms. Duvall's career was at a standstill. Her last film role had come in 2002's "Manna From Heaven," after which she retired for reasons that have remained a mystery from a varied and, by most counts, successful career as both an actor and producer. Among the most common questions that show up when you search her name these days: What happened to Shelley Duvall? and Why did Shelley Duvall disappear?
This enduring curiosity is unsurprising: The very act of fading into obscurity, be it voluntary or forced, is at the heart of the "Hollywood recluse" trope, which is used to tragic effect in classic movies such as "Sunset Boulevard" and "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" and never ceases to intrigue.
It intrigues Shelley Duvall as well.
"I was a star; I had leading roles," she said, solemnly shaking her head. She had parked in the town square for a takeout lunch -- chicken salad, quiche and sweetened iced coffee, finished off with a drag of a Parliament. She lowered her voice. "People think it's just aging, but it's not. It's violence."
Prompted to explain "violence," Ms. Duvall responded with a question:
"How would you feel if people were really nice, and then, suddenly, on a dime" -- she snapped her fingers -- "they turn on you? You would never believe it unless it happens to you. That's why you get hurt, because you can't really believe it's true."
"Everyone's always interested in downfall stories," said Mr. Gilroy, 76, her partner of more than 30 years, who helps her get in and out of her car and sometimes has to plead with her to come back into the house. His voice bore a tone of weariness in discussing the speculation and gossip that still surrounds Ms. Duvall, focusing not only on her mental health, but also her body.
"It's all over the internet: 'Look at her now' and 'You won't believe what she looks like now.' Every celebrity gets that treatment."
He has reason to feel weary, of course: In 2016, Ms. Duvall was a guest on the daytime talk show "Dr. Phil," with the rare television appearance proving to be personally disastrous. Still controversial eight years later, the episode, filmed at the local Best Western without Mr. Gilroy's knowledge -- "I found out days later from people in town that it had happened," Mr. Gilroy said -- showed Ms. Duvall in a state of distress.
"I'm very sick. I need help," Ms. Duvall told Dr. Phil in one clip. He responded: "Well, that's why I'm here."
The episode was titled "A Hollywood Star's Descent Into Mental Illness: Saving The Shining's Shelley Duvall." Wide-eyed, Ms. Duvall went on to utter a slew of bizarre statements, such as claiming to be receiving messages from a "shapeshifting" Robin Williams, who had died two years before, and talking about malevolent forces who were out to do her harm. While the show's stated aim was one of empowerment and destigmatizing mental illness, many, including Stanley Kubrick's daughter Vivian, publicly criticized the show for being exploitative and sensationalist.
Although the episode never aired in full, the damage was done. It led to questions regarding her mental state, and she withdrew further into herself.
"It did nothing for her," said Mr. Gilroy, of the show. "It just put her on the map as an oddity."
'The Female Buster Keaton'
Ms. Duvall, born in Fort Worth in 1949 to Robert and Bobbie Duvall, who worked in law and real estate, had a performative streak. Growing up the oldest and only daughter of four children, Ms. Duvall had always been headstrong.
"I was in a choir once and the person next to me was singing really off key and I couldn't stand it. I had to ask to stand near someone else," she said with a smile.
While Ms. Duvall lacked formal training, or certain qualities you might expect of a traditional leading lady, her rawness worked to her advantage. For one thing, she didn't look or carry herself like a classic Hollywood starlet. She brought an energy to her roles that jarred with the studied naturalism that was the acting style at the time, her voice had a beguiling singsong quality to it, and she had a talent for improvisation.
While these days it is rare for actresses to show their age on or off screen, Ms. Duvall has aged naturally. With her fine gray hair coaxed into three bright scrunchies on top of her head, and, in a faded pink tracksuit, the Ms. Duvall of today cuts a strikingly different figure to the waif who bewitched filmgoers throughout the '70s and '80s.
But her smile is still expressive and kind, her wispy eyebrows often arching to emphasize certain points, to make the listener laugh and win them over. She has an almost cartoonish physicality, with doleful eyes and a goofy humor. This was the woman who once dated Paul Simon and Ringo Starr and worked with some of the era's most famous directors: Robert Altman, Terry Gilliam and Mr. Kubrick, among them. Her sharp fashion sense -- miniskirts, winklepickers, spidery eyelashes -- earned her the nickname "Texas Twiggy."
What made her so captivating then (the film critic Pauline Kael called her the "female Buster Keaton") still exists: a raw honesty, an intuitive quality and a winsome Texas drawl.
"I remember, on 'Saturday Night Live,"' Mr. Gilroy said, "they did a joke in which they were in some kind of room and you could hear the neighbors right through the wall, and one of the lines was, "These walls are thinner than Shelley Duvall!"
Her disappearance wasn't, as it had been rumored, born of a protracted breakdown caused years before by her treatment on the set of "The Shining." In fact, she continues to have only good things to say about that intense yearlong shoot in London and her admiration for Mr. Kubrick. Instead, the pause may be more accurately, though not definitively, attributed to the emotional impact of two events: the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which damaged her Los Angeles home, and the stressful toll of one of her brothers falling ill, which prompted her return to her native Texas three decades ago.
It could also equally be attributed to the curse of fame: It isn't enough to be famous; one must continuously stoke the fire. Leave it for too long, especially if you begin to "age out" as a woman in the industry, and a career will wane.
In 1982, two years after "The Shining" made her a household name, Ms. Duvall started her own production company, Platypus (and, later, another called Think Entertainment), creating television shows for children, most notably "Faerie Tale Theatre." Each episode boasted an all-star cast: Robin Williams, Christopher Reeve, Carol Kane, Bud Cort, Bernadette Peters, and Mick Jagger among them. The overall effect was one of baroque fun, or as Time magazine proclaimed, it offered "a hip, witty twist to storybook classics."
"It's like being a captain of a ship -- you have to steer it in the right direction," she said of producing. Her eyes lit up as she spoke about that fertile creative time, and the painstaking levels of research she undertook for each project.
"I had great people to work with, and of course I got Robert Altman to direct an episode," she said. "He was always there for me."
Never intending to become an actor, Ms. Duvall said she owed her career to Mr. Altman, the acclaimed director who cast her in her first role in his 1970 dark comedy "Brewster McCloud," after she met two of his producers at a party when she was 20.
"He was real fatherly," she said of Mr. Altman. "Sometimes too much so. He was like the old lady who lived in the shoe, who had too many children she didn't know what to do, you know?"
The pair became close friends and would go on to collaborate on seven movies including "Nashville," "Thieves Like Us" (where, incidentally, Ms. Duvall picked up her smoking habit), "McCabe & Mrs. Miller," "Popeye" and "3 Women," for which Ms. Duvall won the 1977 Best Actress Award at Cannes.
"I thought: boy, if it's this easy, why doesn't everybody act?" she said.
'I like the way you cry'
After more than two decades, Ms. Duvall is set to make a return to movies this spring in "The Forest Hills."
Ms. Duvall plays Mama, the mother of Rico (Chiko Mendez), a man who, according to the film's logline, is "tormented by nightmarish visions after enduring head trauma." The film also features Edward Furlong ("Terminator 2"), another actor who has spent a long time away from the spotlight.
Taking her restricted mobility into consideration, the crew traveled to Texas from their main location in upstate New York on three occasions, so that Ms. Duvall could perform her scenes from home. There was a lot of technical problem-solving. For instance, her wheelchair, which Ms. Duvall uses when she isn't in the car, became part of the story. When asked how she came to be involved in the project, Ms. Duvall shrugged: "I wanted to act again. And then this guy kept calling, and so I wound up doing it."
If the crew had any qualms working with Ms. Duvall, they were immediately soothed. "She was able to bring her acting abilities to the table and deliver her lines and bring the character of Mama to life," the director Scott Goldberg, for whom this will be his third feature, said on a recent phone call. "She was one hundred percent a natural. It was as if time never passed."
Ms. Duvall mused: "If you ever do a horror film, other horror films are going to come to you, no matter what you do."
"The Shining," though, would become one of the most iconic in the genre. Mr. Kubrick was inspired to cast her in his film after seeing her in Mr. Altman's "3 Women."
"He said: 'I like the way you cry."'
Though the shoot was grueling -- Mr. Kubrick is known for demanding his actors do hundreds of takes for each scene -- she has fond memories of the experience. Mr. Kubrick and Ms. Duvall would play chess during breaks, and the crew would sit around smoking cigarettes and eating Big Macs.
She recalled how shocked she was when she saw the final cut. "There were scenes I didn't watch being filmed. You know that scene with the two little girls at the end of the hallway, and then they step apart? And you see what's behind them? That was scary, very scary."
Critics at the time picked her performance apart, and she was nominated for a Razzie award for worst actress. But something in the authenticity of her reactions, her otherworldliness, resonated with audiences.
"You forget that she's acting," said Nathan Abrams, a professor of film studies at Bangor University and the co-author of a new biography on Mr. Kubrick. "It's a fantastic performance. Shelley goes through a range of emotions: loving mother, doting wife, and then that scared partner. I think Kubrick clearly saw that ability in that range, and then coached that performance out of her."
"When it comes to horror you really have to strip away everything, and give your soul and really be present," said the actress Felissa Rose, Ms. Duvall's co-star in "The Forest Hills," who is best known for starring in the 1983 cult slasher classic "Sleepaway Camp."
Ms. Rose added: "We're talking about people who are truly ready to unleash their truth, and those people are fun to watch -- and that's exactly what she gave in 'The Shining."'
When asked for her thoughts about Ms. Duvall's disappearance, Ms. Rose said, "A lot of people in this industry put up walls, or say, 'You're Teflon!' or 'You have a thick skin!' you know, have a facade. And she walked in with authenticity and truth, and that's hard."
This vulnerability and openness, perhaps even naiveté, made her particularly susceptible to mistreatment. Into the '80s, the types of roles Ms. Duvall was getting shifted. No longer the young, willowy ingénue, she was cast in more mature roles. In a sense she had moved on, by producing television shows, with built-in acting opportunities within those.
Following the success of her shows "Faerie Tale Theatre" and "Bedtime Stories," she produced the 1990 Disney television musical "Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme," where she met and fell in love with Mr. Gilroy, a musician and member of the group Breakfast Club, who composed and performed some of the soundtrack.
The couple has lived in a rustic one-story house surrounded by fields for over a decade. "It's a little oasis for us," Mr. Gilroy said.
Indeed, it's an isolated but serene setup: Mr. Gilroy's paintings-in-progress stand on easels in the living room, while old framed photographs of Mr. Gilroy and Ms. Duvall smiling affectionately at each other glint on the mantle above the stone fireplace. Scattered around are piles of fan mail.
"It was great, all those years in L.A., really terrific," said Mr. Gilroy. "And when we moved, after the earthquake, it was terrific in Texas. Things went downhill when she started becoming afraid of things, maybe didn't want to work. It's really hard to pin it on any one thing."
Ms. Duvall, once praised for her great imagination, was now being haunted by it. "She became paranoid and just kind of delusional, thinking she was being attacked," said Mr. Gilroy. "She tried to make calls to the F.B.I., and asked our neighbor to protect us."
"It was just shocking that, suddenly, from normal, it went south like that," he added.
'Hello, I'm Shelley Duvall'
Despite her decades' long disappearance, Ms. Duvall's filmography has thrived. Instagram users regularly source new Shelley material from an apparently bottomless archival trove.
"Hello, I'm Shelley Duvall," a line Ms. Duvall would utter as she presented each episode of "Faerie Tale Theatre," is sampled ad nauseam in posts. Yet there are no books, no documentaries, no star on the Walk of Fame. Seemingly dismissed and forgotten by the filmmaking establishment, she has become a cult figure for the quirky, the alternative and the misunderstood -- and they seem to want to protect her, and her legacy, making their own podcasts and films.
"I think she's pretty relatable, like, she kind of came from nothing," said Sarah Lukowski, 23, an Austin-based copywriter who runs a popular Instagram account devoted to all things Shelley Duvall.
Ms. Lukowski became enthralled with Ms. Duvall after watching "The Shining" for the first time in 2016. "It's her unique look: the big eyes and oversized teeth and her offbeat personality -- she reminded me a lot of myself."
The pair now meet up every few months and Ms. Lukowski has become friends with fellow Shelley fans too.
"She was such an enigmatic force," Ms. Lukowski continued. "I mean there are actors today like Anya Taylor-Joy and Mia Goth who have similar features and acting styles, but there'll never be another Shelley, you know?"
This wave of new fans is something Ms. Duvall finds hard to fathom. She seems to straddle between disappointment and a sense of betrayal toward an industry to which she gave so much of herself and yet still misses her old life in Hollywood, when she and Mr. Gilroy hobnobbed with famous friends.
She relishes discussing her career highs, but does not elaborate when prompted to talk about the more troubled aspects of her past.
"That's so great, look at that," she said, pointing to a small dog being carted along the sidewalk in a baby stroller. "Thank goodness for comic relief, right? Do you know that all nine dogs I brought down from L.A. died on that street over there?"
Pets have always been a big part of Ms. Duvall's life and she currently has three parrots, a few cats and a geriatric mutt called Puppy. Passing by a field of thin-looking donkeys on the way home, Ms. Duvall often stops to feed them a couple of slices of sandwich bread through the wire fence. Her innate connection to the natural world lends to a sense of wonderment.
As she drove home, Ms. Duvall's hand would occasionally trail out of the window, holding a smoldering cigarette, motioning over to roadkill or comically snapping like a beak.
Sometimes she disappeared from view entirely.

Data Collection by Cars Is Drawing Scrutiny From U.S. Regulators: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Modern cars are internet-connected and have hundreds of sensors. Lawmakers and regulators have concerns about what's happening with all that data.
In the American imagination, car keys and a driver's license have long represented freedom, autonomy and privacy. But modern cars, which have hundreds of sensors, cameras and internet connectivity, are now potential spying machines acting in ways drivers do not completely understand.
That has lawmakers and regulators concerned.
On Tuesday, Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts sent a letter to Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, urging the agency to investigate automakers for sharing drivers' location information with the police. The senators, both Democrats, say this sharing can "seriously threaten Americans' privacy" by revealing their visits to protests, health clinics, places of worship, support groups or other sensitive places.
"As far-right politicians escalate their war on women, I'm especially concerned about cars revealing people who cross state lines to obtain an abortion," Senator Wyden said in a statement.
Government attention to the car industry is intensifying, experts say, because of the increased technological sophistication of modern cars.
Investigators for the Government Accountability Office recently went car shopping, undercover, to see whether salespeople were overselling autonomous driving abilities. In a March report, the agency concluded that consumers don't fully understand crash avoidance technologies and driver support systems, the improper use of which "can compromise their safety benefits and even pose a risk on the road."
The Federal Communications Commission and California lawmakers want to prevent mobile car apps from being used for stalking and harassment. The F.C.C. has proposed regulating automakers under the Safe Connections Act -- aimed, originally, at phone carriers -- while California is likely to pass a law that would accomplish the same thing, requiring car companies to cut off abusers' remote access to victims' cars.
"No survivor of domestic violence and abuse should have to choose between giving up their car and allowing themselves to be stalked and harmed by those who can access its connectivity and data," Jessica Rosenworcel, who leads the F.C.C., said in a statement.
Privacy regulators have opened investigations. California's privacy regulator has been looking into data use from connected cars for nearly a year, while the F.T.C. already appears to be acting on a letter Senator Markey sent in February, urging the agency to investigate automakers' privacy practices.
Last month, the F.T.C. solicited reports from drivers who objected to how data from their cars had been used. An investigator from the agency reached out to a man named in a New York Times article whose insurance premium increased after General Motors provided data about his driving behavior to the insurance industry. ("Since FTC investigations are nonpublic, we generally don't comment on whether we are investigating a particular matter," said a spokesperson for the agency.)
"To my mind, there has been far too little oversight into automakers' privacy policies, so the more watchdogs, the better," Senator Wyden said.
The most recent letter to the F.T.C. reveals the findings of a yearlong query of 14 automakers that Senator Wyden's office said had jointly received more than 1,400 police requests for location information over the past two years.
Only five of the automakers -- G.M., Honda, Ford, Tesla and Stellantis -- required the police to get a warrant before turning over a car's current or historical whereabouts, with Ford recently enacting that requirement. Tesla is the only automaker that tells customers about such requests, according to the letter.
"In contrast, Toyota, Nissan, Subaru, Volkswagen, BMW, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz and Kia all confirmed that they will disclose location data to U.S. government agencies in response to subpoenas, which do not require a judge's approval," the senators wrote to Ms. Khan. They said this violated a commitment the automakers made in a set of privacy principles they submitted to the F.T.C. a decade ago about how they would protect drivers' sensitive data.
"This is a complex issue; automakers are committed to protecting sensitive vehicle location information," said Brian Weiss, a spokesman for the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association. "Vehicle location information is only provided to law enforcement under specific and limited circumstances, such as when the automaker is provided a warrant or court order or in situations where there is an imminent threat of serious bodily harm or death to an individual."
Automakers generally retain a car's location information for years -- as long as 15 years in the case of Hyundai. Of the 45 location data requests that Hyundai received in the past two years from the police, slightly more than half involved stolen vehicles, the company's spokesman, Ira Gabriel, said.
"There's a renewed focus on cars, and the data practices associated with them," said Andrew Crawford, policy counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology. He attributed this to increased consumer awareness about the components in modern cars and the fact that car data "may be going to folks that they did not contemplate, did not know about and did not want."
At the same time, however, some regulators are pushing automakers to put more technology into cars to improve safety on the roads, which may require even more data collection.
The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended in-car systems in all new vehicles that would tell drivers to slow down when they exceed the speed limit. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has taken steps to require impairment-detection systems in all new vehicles that would prevent a car from operating when the driver had been drinking or using drugs.
When it comes to car safety, the conversation has changed from improving seatbelts to installing more cameras and sensors, said Adonne Washington, a lawyer at the Future of Privacy Forum who wrote a recent report on the privacy implications of proposed safety systems.
For instance, "a mandate for alcohol detection technology in vehicles creates a whole different category of information," she said.
W. James Denvil, a partner at Hogan Lovells who has represented automakers, said the increased scrutiny from regulators was expected.
Vehicles offer "extraordinary benefits," he said. New technologies can enhance safety and the driving experience, while data from cars can be used to improve transportation infrastructure.
"We've got innovative technologies and old regulations," Mr. Denvil said. "There's going to be some surprises and some bumps in the road."

Daimler Truck Deal Averts Strike in North Carolina: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United Automobile Workers reached an agreement involving workers who make Freightliner trucks and Thomas Built buses. The deal comes as the union seeks to expand in Southern states.
The United Automobile Workers reached an 11th-hour deal on Friday with Daimler Truck in North Carolina that gave workers 25 percent raises over the next four years and averted a strike that would have begun Saturday.
The union had said it was ready to walk out if it could not agree on a new contract covering 7,300 Daimler employees. The previous contract expired on Friday. The German company has four factories in North Carolina, where it builds Freightliner and Western Star trucks, and Thomas Built buses. The union also represents workers at parts distribution centers in Atlanta and Memphis.
The deal, which includes profit sharing, automatic cost-of-living increases and equalizes pay among workers at the North Carolina factories, marks a victory for the U.A.W. as it tries to expand its power in Southern states where unions have long been weak.
"When that deadline came closer, the company suddenly became ready to talk," Shawn Fain, the U.A.W.'s leader, said late Friday as he announced the agreement, which will give workers raises of at least 16 percent the first year after they ratify the contract.
Daimler Trucks said in a statement that it hoped U.A.W. members would approve the tentative contracts, "for the mutual benefit of all parties."
A walkout would have had national political repercussions. North Carolina is a political battleground state that has a Democratic governor, but President Biden narrowly lost the state in 2020. Mr. Biden had indicated that he could step in aggressively to support the Daimler workers, possibly putting him at odds with the state's more pro-business Democrats just months before Election Day.
The U.A.W. has been making inroads in the South. It scored a significant victory this month when workers at Volkswagen's factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., voted to be represented by the union. Workers at a Mercedes-Benz factory in Alabama will vote on whether to unionize in mid-May.
Workers at Daimler Truck, which split from Mercedes-Benz in 2021, have been represented by the U.A.W. for several decades. The union has adopted a more assertive stance after winning the biggest pay increases in decades for workers at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the owner of Jeep, Chrysler and Ram after strikes at the three companies last year.
The gains for workers at Daimler could add momentum to the U.A.W.'s drive to organize U.S. auto factories, including at companies like Toyota and Tesla.
Workers in North Carolina said they have been struggling to make ends meet while Daimler racked up big profits. The company, based in Stuttgart, reported net profit last year of 4 billion euros, or $ 4.25 billion, a 44 percent increase from a year earlier. Sales in the United States, Canada and Mexico generated more than half the profit.
The union points out that Thomas Built, whose yellow school buses are a common sight, has benefited from millions of dollars in federal subsidies for electric buses. Thomas Built workers have earned less than counterparts at other factories, but the deal will give them pay increases to make up the deficit.
"Workers who make trucks and workers who make buses will get equal pay for equal work," Mr. Fain said.
The agreement also includes provisions aimed at preserving jobs in North Carolina. Workers had sought more job security after the company moved some production to Mexico.

A Big Bet From Honda On E.V.s In Canada: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Japanese automaker, which has been slow to sell electric vehicles, said it would invest $ 11 billion to make batteries and cars in Ontario.
Honda Motor on Thursday said it and several suppliers would invest $ 11 billion to build batteries and electric cars in Ontario, a significant commitment from a company that has been slow to embrace the technology.
Like Toyota and other Japanese carmakers, Honda has emphasized hybrid vehicles, in which gasoline engines are augmented by electric motors, rather than cars powered solely by batteries. The Honda Prologue, a sport-utility vehicle made in Mexico, is the company's only fully electric vehicle on sale in the United States.
But the investment adjacent to the company's factory in Alliston, Ontario, near Toronto, is a shift in direction, raising the possibility that Honda and other Japanese carmakers could use their manufacturing expertise to push down the cost of electric vehicles and make them affordable to more people.
"This is a very big day for the region, for the province and for the country," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at an announcement event in Alliston, where Honda manufactures the Civic sedan and CR-V S.U.V. The investment, which will create 1,000 new jobs, is the largest by an automaker in Canadian history, he said.
The company is also retooling its flagship factory in Marysville, Ohio, near Columbus, to produce electric vehicles in 2025. Along with LG Energy Solution, a Korean company, Honda is investing $ 4.4 billion in a new battery factory in Jeffersonville, Ohio.
The additional investment in Canada is a sign that Honda expects the technology to become more popular, despite a recent slowdown in sales. The factory in Ontario will be able to produce as many as 240,000 electric vehicles a year when it begins operations in 2028, Honda said. By 2040, Honda plans for all its vehicles to be electric, a firmer commitment than other Japanese carmakers have made.
Toyota, which has faced criticism from environmental groups for its focus on hybrids rather than fully electric vehicles, said Thursday it would expand a factory in Princeton, Ind., to produce a large electric S.U.V.
The company, the world's largest automaker, will spend $ 1.4 billion on the Indiana project and create as many as 340 new jobs, the company said. Toyota has previously announced that it will begin producing batteries next year at a $ 13.9 billion plant in North Carolina.
Canadian leaders have been wooing carmakers with financial incentives that roughly match the tax breaks the United States offers to auto and battery companies under the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden's signature climate law. Canada's federal and provincial governments want the country to become a major player in the electric vehicle supply chain. Vehicles made in Canada can qualify for $ 7,500 U.S. federal tax credits, which are available only to cars made in North America.
Volkswagen said last year it would invest up to $ 5 billion to construct a battery factory in Thomas, Ontario. Northvolt, a Swedish battery company, announced plans last year for a $ 5 billion battery factory near Montreal.
Honda will benefit from up to $ 1.8 billion in tax credits available to companies that invest in electric vehicle projects, Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian finance minister, said Thursday at the event. Ontario is expected to provide additional financial support.
Canada also has reserves of lithium and other materials needed to make batteries, and generates a lot of its electricity from nuclear and hydroelectric plants, which allows carmakers to advertise that their vehicles are made with energy that releases no greenhouse gas emissions.
"As we aim to conduct our business with zero environmental impact, Canada is very attractive," Toshihiro Mibe, the chief executive of Honda, said Thursday in Alliston.
Honda will also work with partners to convert raw materials into battery components, he said. By retaining control over the supply chain, a strategy known as vertical integration, companies like Honda hope to cut costs and make electric vehicles more affordable. BYD, a Chinese automaker, has undercut Tesla and other rivals on price by controlling mines, raw material processing and battery manufacturing.
However, recent declines in the price of lithium have raised questions about whether mining the metal in Canada will be competitive with lower-cost operations in Latin America or Australia.
Political leaders justify spending taxpayer money to attract companies like Honda because car factories also generate thousands of jobs at suppliers. One example is Asahi Kasei, a Japanese company that said on Wednesday that it would spend $ 1.3 billion on a factory to produce components for batteries in Ontario.
Honda will be the plant's main customer, Asahi Kasei said, but it will also sell to others. The supplier said it expected to also receive financial support from Canada and Ontario.

U.A.W. Gets New Toehold In the South: [News Analysis]

Full text: Some experts say the outcome at a plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., may be organized labor's most significant advance in decades. But the road could get rockier.
By voting to join the United Automobile Workers, Volkswagen workers in Tennessee have given the union something it has never had: a factory-wide foothold at a major foreign automaker in the South.
The result, in an election that ended on Friday, will enable the union to bargain for better wages and benefits. Now the question is what difference it will make beyond the Volkswagen plant.
Labor experts said success at VW might position the union to replicate its showing at other auto manufacturers throughout the South, the least unionized region of the country. Some argued that the win could help set off a rise in union membership at other companies that exceeds the uptick of the past few years, when unions won elections at Starbucks and Amazon locations.
"It's a big vote, symbolically and substantively," said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist who studies labor at Washington University in St. Louis.
The next test for the U.A.W. will come in a vote in mid-May at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama.
In addition, at least 30 percent of workers have signed cards authorizing the U.A.W. to represent them at a Hyundai plant in Alabama and a Toyota plant in Missouri, according to the union. That is the minimum needed to force an election, though the union has yet to petition for one in either location.
"People only take action when they believe there is an alternative to the status quo that has a plausible chance of winning," said Barry Eidlin, a sociologist at McGill University in Montreal.
Still, it's unclear how far the campaign may spread beyond German manufacturers. Volkswagen and Mercedes have been relatively friendly to unions outside the United States, and a recent German law could prompt financial penalties against companies that crack down on union organizing.
Compared with previous elections in Chattanooga, Volkswagen's pushback against the union was mild this time, according to workers. The company presented reasons it believed a union was unnecessary, including pay that is above average for the Chattanooga area, but said it left the decision to the workers.
Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at the research firm AutoForecast Solutions, predicted that most Japanese and South Korean manufacturers with plants in the South would be more difficult targets for the U.A.W. because they have worked hard to develop a close relationship with workers or have butted heads with unions in their home country, or both.
The Chattanooga vote could also lead to a broader political battle over unionization within the region. Business and political leaders in the South say a greater union presence could threaten their states' economic advantages and slow down job creation.
"If we become less competitive, why not do it in Detroit?" said Gerald McCormick, a Republican who was the Tennessee House majority leader when the U.A.W. first prompted a union vote at the Volkswagen plant in 2014.
Six Republican governors highlighted those concerns in a statement on Tuesday, which said that the union campaign was "driven by misinformation and scare tactics." Opposition from state and local politicians helped defeat the union in a vote at a Nissan plant in Mississippi in 2017 and in elections at VW in Chattanooga in 2014 and 2019.
The U.A.W.'s political support for Democrats -- the union endorsed President Biden's re-election in January -- could also be a vulnerability in such a fight. Isaac Meadows, a worker at the Volkswagen plant, said in an interview in February that the endorsement had led some co-workers to have second thoughts about the union, but that he had advised them that "the political landscape changes every four to eight years and doesn't directly affect us."
Even so, a change in presidential administrations could bring a more skeptical National Labor Relations Board, which presides over union elections and enforces labor law and could make it more difficult for the union to win at other plants.
Worker advocates and union organizers acknowledged that the win in Chattanooga could trigger a strong response. "You have to imagine the backlash," said Erica Smiley, executive director of Jobs With Justice, which helps workers seeking to unionize and bargain collectively. "My hope is that enough people understand both within the U.A.W. and within the union world writ large that you have to defend the union election."
Organizers also conceded that any momentum generated by the union victory in Chattanooga could be muted until workers there win a contract that brings concrete gains, a process that can take years.
It has been two years since Amazon workers at a Staten Island warehouse became the first to win a union election at the company in the United States, and they have yet to begin bargaining as the company challenges the victory. The lack of progress toward a contract appears to have complicated organizing efforts at other Amazon sites.
But the Volkswagen employees in Chattanooga have advantages that the Amazon workers lack. Unlike the Amazon Labor Union, their union is well established and can invest millions of dollars in staff and legal work to help bargain a contract. And Volkswagen appears more willing than Amazon to bargain, partly because of its labor ties in Germany.
"If workers in Chattanooga get a great contract, a big raise, better health benefits, and then the same thing at Mercedes, there will be a lot more good opportunities to win good contracts in short order," said Madeline Janis, co-executive director of Jobs to Move America, a group that seeks to create good jobs in clean technology industries.
Ms. Janis, whose group is involved in unionizing factory workers in the South, said the momentum could travel beyond the auto industry to other manufacturers because employees at different companies in the region often know one another and discuss these issues. "Their brothers and sisters and spouses are working at other plants," she said. "It will be all over social media."
And some experts said that a rise in unionization at factories could spread to other types of jobs. "The enthusiasm is contagious across sectors," said David Pryzbylski, a lawyer at Barnes & Thornburg who represents employers. "People look at it and say, 'Hey, I think there's something here. Maybe I should be interested in it, too."'
Several workers echoed the point, saying they had drawn encouragement from labor actions in other industries over the past few years. Successful campaigns in Hollywood and at companies like Starbucks and Apple "have been a major boon for us," said Emma Geiger, a worker at Sega of America who helped unionize the video game maker last year. "Especially in the perception of unions on the whole as not something to be feared, but to be embraced."
Overall, nearly 70 percent of Americans say they support unions, according to Gallup, up from about 50 percent a decade and a half ago. After dropping for several years, the number of union members increased by nearly 280,000 in 2022 and by about half that amount last year, though the percentage of workers in unions dropped slightly because even more people entered the work force. Filings for union elections were up 35 percent in the six months ending in March compared with the same period one year earlier, according to the National Labor Relations Board.
During the mid-1930s, union membership grew by several hundred thousand for three straight years, then jumped by roughly three million in 1937, most of it after the U.A.W. organized General Motors.
Another expansion on this scale is unlikely given changes in the economy, including the shift away from manufacturing as a source of jobs. But Michael Lotito, a lawyer at Littler Mendelson, which represents employers, said the past few years had produced "a lot of kindling" that could make it easier for a fire of sorts to spread.
Citing workers' frustrations over the pandemic and return-to-office policies, which they have amplified on social media, he said that "from a management perspective, it's of concern."

Full text: The Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga is set to become the first unionized auto factory in the South not owned by one of Detroit's Big Three.
In a landmark victory for organized labor, workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee have voted overwhelmingly to join the United Automobile Workers union, becoming the first nonunion auto plant in a Southern state to do so.
The company said in a statement late Friday that the union had won 2,628 votes, with 985 opposed, in a three-day election. Two earlier bids by the U.A.W. to organize the Chattanooga factory over the last 10 years were narrowly defeated.
The outcome is a breakthrough for the labor movement in a region where anti-union sentiment has been strong for decades. And it comes six months after the U.A.W. won record wage gains and improved benefits in negotiations with the Detroit automakers.
The U.A.W. has for more than 80 years represented workers employed by General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the producer of Chrysler, Jeep, Ram and Dodge vehicles, and has organized some heavy-truck and bus factories in the South.
But the union had failed in previous attempts to organize any of the two dozen automobile factories owned by other companies across an area stretching from South Carolina to Texas and as far north as Ohio and Indiana.
With the victory in Chattanooga, the U.A.W. will turn its focus to other Southern plants. A vote will take place in mid-May at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Ala., near Tuscaloosa. The U.A.W. is hoping to organize a half-dozen or more plants over the next two years.
"Tonight you all together have taken a giant, historic step," Shawn Fain, the president of the U.A.W., said at a celebratory gathering in Chattanooga. "Tonight we celebrate this historic moment in our nation's and our union's history. Let's get to it and go to work and win more for the working class of this nation."
A string of victories for the U.A.W. could have profound effects for Southern auto workers and the broader auto industry. Nonunion auto workers typically earn significantly lower wages than those in U.A.W.-represented plants, and collective bargaining could bring them substantial increases in pay, benefits and job security.
"Volkswagen workers will have a chance for better pay and working conditions under a collective bargaining agreement," said Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. "They'll have a lot of job protections under a union contract that they don't have now."
At G.M., Ford and Stellantis, any layoffs have to be planned with advance notice to the union, and workers get supplemented unemployment benefits. Nonunion plants don't have to take such measures.
A large U.A.W. presence in the South would also upset an automotive landscape in which U.A.W. contracts have left G.M., Ford and Stellantis with higher labor costs than nonunion rivals like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Tesla and Hyundai.
"This is a watershed moment for the industry," said Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, who has followed the U.A.W. for more than three decades. "It sets an example that would resonate across the industry, and across other industries where there's a large presence of nonunion workers."
The U.A.W.'s success in the negotiations with the Big Three in the fall set off a surge in interest among Southern autoworkers in organizing their own plants, the union said, and prompted the U.A.W. to kick off a $ 40 million effort to support them.
Volkswagen workers who voted in favor of U.A.W. representation said they hoped the union would help them win higher wages and more paid time off. The Chattanooga factory currently pays a top wage of about $ 35 an hour, compared with the top wage of more than $ 40 an hour that G.M., Ford and Stellantis now pay U.A.W. workers.
The U.A.W. contracts also provide health care coverage that is almost entirely paid by the companies, substantial profit-sharing bonuses, cost-of-living adjustments to insulate workers from inflation and generous retirement programs.
Among those voting for the U.A.W. in Chattanooga was Tony Akridge, 48, who is in his second year at the VW plant, working on motors and transmissions on the night shift. His $ 23 hourly wage exceeded what he earned in previous jobs, he said, but he voted for the U.A.W. in hopes that the union could help improve workers' living standards.
"It gives us a better opportunity," Mr. Akridge said. "They pay us OK, but it's not good enough for the things they need done. Noting the rising cost of living, he added that the union "will get better benefits toward that, making life just a little bit more easy."
Others are counting on U.A.W. representation to bring more paid time off. Most VW workers must either take unpaid time off when the plant shuts down in the summer and around the holidays, or use paid time off to cover those periods. If they do, many are left with only a few days to cover any sick days or family leave the rest of the year, workers said.
"We're forced to use our P.T.O. a lot instead of using it on our own terms sometimes," said Craig Jackson, 56, who voted for the union.
At the Detroit automakers, U.A.W. workers get up to five weeks of vacation and 19 paid holidays, and are allowed two weeks for parental leave.
Workers who opposed the union at VW said they were unsure what gains the U.A.W. could bring them.
"You really don't have any kind of guarantee with them," said Darrell Belcher, 54, who has worked on the assembly floor for 13 years and voted against the U.A.W. in the two previous elections at the plant. "I'm not saying we won't gain anything, but we are probably going to lose something just to gain it."
As the voting was about to start, the governors of Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas -- all Republicans -- issued a statement on Tuesday saying unionizing would jeopardize auto jobs in their states.
"We want to keep good-paying jobs and continue to grow the American auto manufacturing sector here," the governors said. "A successful unionization drive will stop this growth in its tracks, to the detriment of American workers."
But even some VW workers who opposed the U.A.W. said they did not think union representation would endanger the Chattanooga plant. "I do not feel that the plant will leave Chattanooga or the South," said Cody Rose, 34, a 13-year veteran of the plant who works in body shop production. "Volkswagen has too much invested in this area."
The Chattanooga plant opened in 2011, and employs 5,500 people, of whom about 4,300 were eligible to vote in the union election. The plant produces the VW Atlas, a large sport utility vehicle, and an electric vehicle, the ID.4. It is Volkswagen's only plant in the United States, and was the only VW plant in the world that was not unionized.
The U.A.W. had some advantages in winning support at Volkswagen. Its effort had the support of IG Metall, the powerful union that represents autoworkers in Germany. German companies also have a strong tradition of giving workers a voice. Under German law, worker representatives must hold half the seats on a company's supervisory board, the equivalent of a board of directors.
The U.A.W. can now turn its attention to the Mercedes plant in Alabama, which employs about 6,100 people. The union tried to organize that plant once before, but the effort died out before coming to a vote.

Voting Tests Union's Push At VW Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The United Automobile Workers hopes contract gains at the Big Three carmakers will provide momentum in a broad effort to organize nonunion plants.
Last fall the United Automobile Workers union won big pay increases from the Detroit automakers, and the impact rippled quickly through the nonunion auto plants scattered across the South.
Afterward, Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen, Nissan, Hyundai and Tesla raised wages for their own hourly workers in the United States, none of whom are unionized. On production lines in Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and elsewhere, those pay increases have been referred to as the "U.A.W. bump."
Now 4,300 workers at Volkswagen's plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., will test whether the union can achieve an even greater bump. On Wednesday, they began voting on whether to join the U.A.W., and the prospects of a union victory appear high. About 70 percent of the workers pledged to vote yes before the union asked for a vote, according to the U.A.W.
"I think our chances are excellent," said Kelcey Smith, 48, who has worked in the VW plant's paint department for a year and is a member of a committee working to build support for the U.A.W. "The energy is high. I think we are going to nail it."
Volkswagen has presented reasons it believes a union is not needed at the plant, including pay that is above average for the Chattanooga region. But it has also said it encourages all workers to vote in the election, which is to conclude on Friday, and decide for themselves. "No one will lose their job for voting for or against the union," a company spokesman said.
The stakes go beyond the Tennessee plant, Volkswagen's only U.S. factory. A victory there would add fuel to the U.A.W.'s push to extend its presence to the more than two dozen nonunion auto plants in the United States, mostly clustered in Southern states where union resistance has been strong historically, and where right-to-work laws make it hard for unions to organize workers.
The U.A.W.'s chances beyond the Volkswagen factory are unclear. Japanese and South Korean automakers have demonstrated more forceful opposition to the U.A.W. than the German companies. Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has spoken out against the U.A.W. on several occasions over the last few years.
And on Tuesday, the Republican governors of six states -- Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas -- denounced the U.A.W. drive, saying in a statement that they were "highly concerned about the unionization campaign driven by misinformation and scare tactics that the U.A.W. has brought into our states."
"We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states," the governors declared. "These jobs have become part of the fabric of the automotive manufacturing industry. Unionization would certainly put our states' jobs in jeopardy."
The vote at VW will be followed by another election -- as yet unscheduled -- at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Ala., where the U.A.W. says a majority of workers have signed up to back the union.
The U.A.W. says victories at VW, Mercedes and other plants would bring increased wages, richer benefits and higher living standards for tens of thousands of workers, many of them in the nation's poorer counties.
Widespread unionizing in the Southern plants would also help level a playing field that for nearly half a century has been tilted against the three unionized Detroit manufacturers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler. In operating nonunion factories, foreign-owned companies have a significant labor-cost advantage over their U.S.-based rivals.
"It would be a revolution for the U.A.W. and for the auto industry," said Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, who has followed the U.A.W. for more than three decades. "It would break the glass ceiling for unions in the South, and would mean more purchasing power for working-class people in that region."
The U.A.W. has organized several heavy-truck and bus plants in the South, but for decades has tried and failed to do the same at automobile factories, which are typically larger.
The VW election is the union's third try at the plant. Workers rejected U.A.W. representation by a vote of 712 to 626 in 2014, and by an even narrower margin, 833 to 776, in 2019. Opposition from Republican elected officials in Tennessee was vociferous in those campaigns.
In the last 10 years, the U.A.W. also lost in a 2017 vote at a Nissan plant in Canton, Miss., and an organizing drive at the Mercedes plant fizzled without an election.
In those efforts, the U.A.W. was hampered by a dubious track record and a questionable reputation. Over nearly 30 years, the Detroit automakers closed dozens of plants, eliminating tens of thousands of hourly jobs, despite the U.A.W.'s objections. Some industry executives have blamed high union wages, in part, for pushing G.M. and Chrysler into bankruptcy in 2009. In addition, the union was racked by corruption scandals that resulted in prison sentences for two former presidents and about a dozen other senior U.A.W. officials.
In the past two years, however, the U.A.W. has undergone a transformation. Financial reforms and transparency measures overseen by a federal monitor have helped root out corruption. A feisty president, Shawn Fain, was chosen in the union's first direct election by the membership. In the contract negotiations last year with G.M., Ford and Stellantis, Mr. Fain used a new approach, choosing all three companies as strike targets but shutting down only selected plants, which put pressure on the companies without crippling them or damaging the broader U.S. economy.
After six weeks, the union had contracts raising the top wage 25 percent, to more than $ 40 an hour. Pay for workers lower on the wage scale will rise to the top wage over three years instead of eight. Some will see their pay double. A worker putting in 40 hours a week at the top wage will earn about $ 83,000 a year. In recent years, profit-sharing bonuses have added about $ 9,000 to $ 14,000.
On top of that, the new contracts provide wage adjustments if inflation pushes the cost of living higher, improved pensions and retirement benefits, and increased paid time off. U.A.W. workers have also long had company-paid health care with no deductibles or co-payments.
Hourly wages at the nonunion auto plants used to start under $ 20 and top out around $ 32. The "U.A.W. bump" lifted the range to roughly $ 22 to $ 35. Volkswagen said its workers typically earned about $ 60,000 a year. (The annual mean wage for all occupations in the Chattanooga area was $ 54,480 in May, according to the U.S. Labor Department.)
Seizing on momentum from the Big Three negotiations, Mr. Fain said, the union will spend $ 40 million through 2026 to support organizing at plants owned by Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda, Volvo and Tesla, as well as others owned by the electric vehicle start-ups Rivian and Lucid Motors.
VW workers who support the U.A.W. say their wages are pretty good for Tennessee but point 300 miles north to Louisville, Ky., where Ford pays many workers more than $ 40 an hour to make the Expedition sport utility vehicle, which competes with the VW Atlas made in Chattanooga.
"If Ford can pay that much, why can't Volkswagen pay us the same?" said Isaac Meadows, 40, a father of six who has worked at the VW plant for 14 months. "We have more worth than they're paying us."
There are concerns beyond the hourly wage. Workers must use paid time off if they want to be paid during two periods when the plant shuts down around the year-end holidays and in summer.
Once he covers the shutdowns with vacation days, Mr. Meadows said, he is left with about 16 hours of paid time off to cover any family events or sick days for the rest of the year. "I miss my kids' dances, sporting events, family gatherings," he said. "I miss a lot because I've got to work."

Electric Cars Are Boring: [Op-Ed]

Full text: We're at an inflection point in electric-car optimism. Over the past few years, as electric vehicle sales increased substantially and car companies announced an onslaught of new battery-powered models, it seemed that electric cars were a near-term inevitability. But for all the heady promise, E.V. enthusiasm seems to be cooling.
Ford recently announced that it's cutting production targets for the Lightning, its electric truck. Brag-and-bluster Tesla projected that sales growth in 2024 would be "notably lower" than in recent years. Hertz is selling off about a third of its electric cars and Audi is slowing its transition to E.V.s. There are plenty of obvious headwinds for E.V.s -- cost, range, and charging infrastructure (or lack thereof). But there's also a more subtle issue at play, one that won't be easily resolved: Electric cars are too boring.
I know this seems like a preposterous complaint, and I agree. On the list of things wrong with the world, "electric cars are dull" isn't in the Top 5. I revel in being able to charge my plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica with my solar panels, and believe that E.V.s are the answer to humanity's long-term transportation needs. However, I also believe that the anesthetic experience of driving an electric car is a real hurdle to the technology's widespread adoption, given that nearly every potential E.V. buyer grew up with the rich sensory experience of internal combustion.
Driving, as we all knew it before the arrival of mass-market electric cars a little more than a decade ago, involved familiar rituals that carved out a place in our collective psyche. You'd turn a key or push a button, feel a rumble of vibration through the seat and steering wheel, put a transmission in gear and listen to the revs rise and fall with upshifts and downshifts. Maybe you learned to drive with a manual transmission, with your feet dancing between clutch and accelerator as you chose your gears, herky-jerky at first but eventually tilling a furrow into muscle memory. There might be smells, oil and gas or diesel, not pleasant but not entirely unpleasant, either.
For people who love cars, and even those who don't, this flood of visceral sensory feedback becomes associated with freedom and road trips, first dates and dashes to the grocery store.
Electric cars make a clean break from all of that. Climb into an electric car, and there's often no key to turn or start button to push -- it's just on. There's little noise except for the legally required pedestrian warning tone, which often sounds like Trent Reznor composing a creepy-synth Nine Inch Nails tune somewhere behind the front bumper. Some of them have a "one pedal" mode that doesn't even require touching the brake pedal most of the time. It's like driving a sensory deprivation chamber. For passengers, it's luxurious. For drivers, it's dull.
Sure, some versions of the Lucid Air and Tesla Model S can hit 150 m.p.h. in less than 10 seconds, but that's important the same way it's important for watches to be waterproof to a depth of 1,000 feet -- as a brag for tedious rich people. The Tesla Cybertruck, with its polygon-meme shape and stainless-steel skin, is essentially the world's most visible riposte to the boring-E.V. problem. Squeeze the accelerator, though, and it behaves like every other electric car, which is to say quick and coldhearted.
Powerful acceleration used to be a thrill in its own right, but E.V.s commodified and muffled that aspect of performance. A quick electric car is as common as a sunny day in Los Angeles, a pleasant base-line normal that's mostly taken for granted.
Perhaps it's true that many cars are generally boring regardless of how they're powered, deliberately inoffensive in the name of mass appeal. And griping about sound and character might sound like the futile whining of a demographic raised on muscle cars and four-speed manuals -- "OK Boomer" on wheels. But I've got some bad news for car companies hoping that the next generation will become E.V.-native.
My kids are 11 and 13 years old and they are manifestly unexcited about electric cars. When they play Forza on Xbox, I hear the shrieks of Lamborghinis and the roar of Ford Raptors emanating from the room. I test cars for a living, and the kids' favorite car from the past few years was the Dodge Challenger Black Ghost, an 807-horsepower resource-pillager that represents the last gasp of supercharged V-8 thunder for Dodge. It's a stupid car, really, peak mouth-breather, screaming of wretched excess. But its analog mechanical brutality activates some primal lobe deep in our brains, the one that catalyzes noise into adrenaline. The final V-8 Challenger rolled off the line on Dec. 22 last year, another dinosaur obliterated by the E.V. asteroid.
Car companies are trying to figure out how to recapture the distinctive personalities of cars like the Black Ghost in the E.V. era. Dodge envisions a booming speaker system for its future electric muscle cars, mimicking loud exhaust. BMW is going futuristic, with a soundtrack developed by Hans Zimmer -- floor the accelerator, and the iX model fills with the noise of a synth-spaceship warp. Toyota is developing a manual transmission emulator for electric cars, to return some of the driving engagement. Or so we can hope.
Building a simulated manual transmission that's not really connected to anything might sound a little bit pathetic, but I have reason to be optimistic, because I've seen how quickly technology can change. Twenty years ago, I went to Michelin's alternative-fuel vehicle conference in Shanghai, and at that point nobody saw lithium batteries and electric cars on the horizon. Now we have electric pickup trucks that are as quick as a Corvette, and wind and solar power are the fastest growing and cheapest new means of producing electricity. The Biden administration aims to hasten E.V. adoption with new rules and tax incentives. And it seems logical that, after conquering their objective goals, car companies will turn to the subjective ones, the noises and nuances that make driving fun.
Look, all I want is an E.V. that sounds like a mountain lion keening at your bedroom window, the way a Porsche 911 GT3 does at full throttle. The GT3 -- and many of our favorite cars -- could easily be made much quieter. But Porsche understands that sometimes, to make a car better, you've got to make it a little worse.
The electric future is clean, smooth and refined. But we might get there sooner if we can figure out how to rough it up a little bit.

Full text: Zwickau, a city in Germany's east, may not be as famous as Detroit, but its economy has revolved around internal combustion engines since August Horch established Audi here at the beginning of the 20th century.
So when Volkswagen announced in 2018 that it would convert its Zwickau factory, the largest private employer in the area, to manufacture nothing but electric vehicles, it was a big deal.
"A lot of people were skeptical," said Michael Fuchs, who has worked at the factory for more than a quarter century. They wondered, "What's going to happen?" he said.
Volkswagen shut down assembly lines churning out its popular Golf hatchbacks and converted the factory, which has its own exit on the autobahn, to make six electric models. The remodeled plant can produce a car a minute, shipping them out by train.
It was a rare case of a major car plant's switching completely from internal combustion to battery power, making Zwickau a case study for a big question confronting the auto industry.
Electric vehicles have far fewer parts than gasoline cars -- no radiators, exhaust pipes, fuel tanks, fan belts or complicated gearboxes. As a result, many autoworkers, executives and politicians have hypothesized that such cars would require fewer workers, leading to mass unemployment in factory towns and cities worldwide.
Zwickau, where more than 10,000 people work for Volkswagen and tens of thousands more for suppliers, appears to have avoided those dire consequences. Employment hasn't fallen off a cliff, and suppliers of combustion vehicle parts haven't been forced into bankruptcy en masse. Its experience offers some hopeful lessons for other places that depend on the auto industry.
Yet people in Zwickau, with its immaculate but sleepy downtown, are still uneasy.
While Zwickau's experience suggests that conversion to electric vehicles will not itself lead to economic misery, this and other new technologies are shaking up the industry in ways that could still be very painful for established companies and their workers.
One big change already visible in Germany and the rest of Europe is the fast growth of young Chinese electric carmakers like BYD and SAIC, which are increasingly luring customers away from established rivals like Volkswagen, the world's second-largest automaker after Toyota.
"The question is: How much will mobility change overall?" said Thomas Knabel, who leads the Zwickau local of IG Metall, the union that represents Volkswagen workers. "In the future, will Volkswagen still be present?"
The best-selling electric car in Europe is Tesla's Model Y sport utility vehicle, built at a factory around 145 miles north of Zwickau near Berlin. Last year, Volkswagen sold fewer than half as many of its equivalent S.U.V., the ID.4, according to Schmidt Automotive Research.
Disappointing sales have prompted Volkswagen to cut a shift on one of its two assembly lines in Zwickau, where the company makes the ID.4, the ID.5, two Audi models and two small electric cars. The decision illustrated the downside of going all-in on electric vehicles. Other established carmakers have hedged their bets, producing electric vehicles and fuel-burning cars in the same factories, allowing them to adjust to fluctuating sales.
"It's a much more ambitious project than anything I know about in North America," said Ian Greer, a research professor at Cornell University who has studied the region around Zwickau. "VW has taken a much bigger risk."
With the factory operating below capacity, some people in Zwickau wonder whether Volkswagen's electric vehicles are appealing enough.
Max Jankowsky, president of the regional Chamber of Commerce, said he was disappointed that he hadn't seen any Volkswagens during a recent trip to Dubai. "It was just Teslas, Teslas, Teslas," said Mr. Jankowsky, who is also the president of a company that makes cast iron parts for Volkswagen suppliers and other manufacturers.
Volkswagen's executives say they expect sales to pick up this year as it begins selling new models, including a station wagon and a van, targeting market segments that Tesla does not play in.
"We are aware of our current challenges and are tackling them rigorously," Oliver Blume, the Volkswagen chief executive, said last month in a statement.
In the short term, at least, the pain to the local economy caused by the Zwickau factory's conversion was surprisingly mild, local officials, business leaders and worker representatives say.
Increased demand for workers to manufacture electronic components largely compensated for job losses from production lines that made parts for combustion cars, according to a study by AMZ Saxony, a suppliers' group.
"All in all," said Dirk Vogel, chief executive of AMZ, "not that much happened."
Volkswagen, local businesses and officials coordinated an effort to prepare workers and businesses, blunting the impact.
The carmaker expanded its training institute in Zwickau to teach employees about electric vehicle technology. To generate enthusiasm, Volkswagen allowed workers to borrow battery-powered cars for a few days. The West Saxon University of Applied Sciences in Zwickau, a state college that already had a strong focus on the auto industry, expanded courses related to electric vehicle technology.
Suppliers developed new components for electric vehicles to replace products in danger of becoming obsolete. Eberspächer, a German supplier that has a factory 60 miles east of Zwickau, near Dresden, began offering temperature-control systems for electric vehicles in addition to emission systems for conventional cars.
A few suppliers have suffered. GKN Driveline, which makes drive shafts not needed in most electric cars, is closing a factory in Zwickau and shifting production to Hungary. But GKN did not supply Volkswagen, and the closure appears to be a reaction to broader trends in the industry and German labor costs. GKN did not reply to requests for comment.
New technology has also created jobs, including 175 at FDTech, based in the nearby city, Chemnitz. The firm, partly owned by Volkswagen, is one of five companies in the area developing autonomous driving technology.
Zwickau benefits from some unique good fortune. Many local suppliers make seats, dashboards, painting equipment or other products that electric vehicles need just as much as gasoline cars.
Because of a shortage of electricians, engineers and other skilled workers, the unemployment rate in the state of Saxony, which includes Zwickau, has increased only modestly. It was 6.6 percent in March amid an overall economic slowdown, up from 6.3 percent a year earlier.
"There will be suppliers that disappear," said Karsten Schulze, the managing director of FDTech. "But the skilled workers will be immediately sought after elsewhere."
Volkswagen workers had some control because German law requires them to be consulted on changes that affect working conditions. The IG Metall union extracted a promise from the company not to lay off any full-time employees in Zwickau until 2030 at the earliest. The guarantee does not apply to temporary workers, however, and the company let 270 of them go after their contracts expired.
In the United States, unions are relatively strong in the Midwest and East, but most automobile factories in the South are not unionized. The United Automobile Workers is trying to change that. But even if the union is successful, U.S. companies will have no obligation to consult workers about changes that will affect their jobs, or to retrain them for new jobs. And there is no guarantee that new jobs making batteries, for example, will pay as well as jobs in factories where cars are assembled.
Residents note with pride that Zwickau has survived many upheavals. After Germany's defeat in World War II, Soviet occupiers confiscated Audi's manufacturing equipment. The carmaker moved to Bavaria and was later acquired by Volkswagen.
The Communist government that ruled East Germany converted the Zwickau factory to produce no-frills Trabant vehicles. The cars spewed blue exhaust and had a body made of plastic because of steel shortages. They could not compete with Western cars after the reunification of Germany in 1991. Thousands of Trabant workers lost their jobs. By the end of the 1990s, unemployment in the region exceeded 20 percent.
Volkswagen acquired the Zwickau factory after reunification and gradually expanded it into one of the company's biggest production sites. The conversion to electric cars was momentous enough that Angela Merkel, the German chancellor at the time, attended a dedication ceremony in 2019, when the first battery-powered model rolled off the assembly line.
Not everyone in Zwickau is a fan of electric cars. The far-right Alternative for Deutschland party, which has 11 of 48 seats in the Zwickau City Council, has complained that Germans are being forced to buy electric vehicles, echoing comments from former President Donald J. Trump and other Republicans.
The national government, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, angered many in Zwickau when it abruptly slashed subsidies for electric vehicles last year to deal with a budget crisis. Sales of electric vehicles in Germany slumped 14 percent during the first three months of the year, though they still accounted for 12 percent of new cars.
Still, few people in Zwickau are pushing for Volkswagen to go back to building gasoline cars.
"With a transition to a new technology, the question is always: Are you the first or the last?" said Constance Arndt, the lord mayor of Zwickau. "I think it's always better to be first."

Full text: As they look to contain an increasingly aggressive China, the United States and Japan announced dozens of new agreements, including on military, economic, climate and space matters.
President Biden and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan reaffirmed on Wednesday the decades-old bond between their two countries, declaring a unity of military and economic purpose as they struggle to confront the actions of an increasingly hostile Chinese government.
Mr. Kishida's daylong visit at the White House culminated with a lengthy joint statement from the two leaders listing dozens of new agreements. Here is a partial list of some of the major announcements.
Military cooperation
The United States and Japan announced a plan to upgrade their military command and control functions to better coordinate and work together. "More effective U.S.-Japan Alliance command and control provides strengthened deterrence and promotes a free and open Indo-Pacific," the two leaders announced in a statement released hours after their meeting.
The two countries said they would increasingly partner to produce military equipment. "We announce our intention to explore co-production of advanced and interoperable missiles for air defense and other purposes to further bolster the Alliance deterrence posture," the statement said.
The Biden administration said it would ask Congress for authorization to use private companies in Japan to do some repairs on U.S. naval ships. The two countries also announced that they would "explore the possibility of conducting maintenance and repair on engines of Japan-based U.S. Air Force aircrafts, including fourth-generation fighters."
The two countries revealed that the United States, Britain and Australia, which agreed to join forces last year to construct and deploy advanced nuclear submarines, are "considering cooperation with Japan" in the partnership, known as Aukus.
Space exploration
The two countries agreed that two Japanese astronauts would be among those to travel to the moon on future American Artemis missions. "Japan will provide and maintain a pressurized rover to support astronauts living and working on the moon, while the United States will allocate two astronaut flight opportunities to the lunar surface for Japan on future Artemis missions," the statement said.
Japan will participate in a NASA mission known as Dragonfly, bound for the Saturn moon Titan, and collaborate on the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, a next-generation observatory.
Economic cooperation
The two countries announced several major economic deals involving private company investments, including a plan by Microsoft to invest $ 2.9 billion over the next two years in Japan in artificial intelligence; a $ 1 billion Google investment to improve digital communications infrastructure; and an investment by Toyota of nearly $ 8 billion for electric car battery production in Greensboro, N.C., which is expected to create 3,000 jobs.
They announced a $ 110 million artificial intelligence joint venture by the University of Washington, University of Tsukuba, Carnegie Mellon University and Keio University. It will be funded by Nvidia, Arm, Amazon, Microsoft and several Japanese companies.
The leaders announced the creation of the Japan Innovation Campus, which will aim to help Japanese startups in Silicon Valley, and the Global Startup Campus in Tokyo. Both projects have a goal of accelerating innovation.
Climate cooperation
The two countries pledged to work more closely to reduce the effects of climate change and to accelerate the transition to clean energy. They announced the creation of a "new high-level dialogue" on the implementation of their own domestic measures to maximize the effectiveness of their policies.
The two countries pledged to work toward modernization of power grids and to share best practices in that area.
The United States praised Japan's move to resume nuclear power generation. "In pursuit of this vision, the United States applauds the prime minister's plan to restart nuclear reactors to meet its 2030 decarbonization goals," the statement said.
People-to-people ties
The two countries announced the creation of a Mineta Ambassadors Program named after Norman Y. Mineta, a former member of Congress and transportation secretary who was the first Japanese American cabinet member. The $ 12 million program will involve U.S. and Japanese high school and university students.
Japan will become a full member of the U.S. Global Entry program, which allows faster clearance for people who are preapproved to travel from foreign airports into the United States with less hassle.

From Japanese Farm to Chip 'Fab': [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Taiwan's semiconductor giant, TSMC, is quickly remaking a farm town in Japan into Asia's next hub of chip manufacturing with enormous government support.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is transforming the small Japanese farm town of Kikuyo into a key node in Asia's chip supply chain.
TSMC, as the company is known, dominates the global semiconductor business. At its home base in Taiwan, TSMC sits at the center of a web of factories, suppliers and engineering firms. Now that same infrastructure, backed by billions of dollars from the Japanese government, is being built about 750 miles away in the cow pastures and cabbage fields of Kikuyo in southwestern Japan.
In February, TSMC opened a factory, known as a chip "fab," for fabricator, on a ridge overlooking Kikuyo. It was its first outside Taiwan since 2018.
The area around the fab is already busy with TSMC employees and suppliers. Chemical companies and equipment makers are vying for a piece of the semiconductor economy. The Japanese electronics giants Sony, Denso and Toyota, major buyers of TSMC semiconductors, are investing huge sums in TSMC's Japan subsidiary.
On roadsides and in shopping malls and hotels, signs in traditional Chinese characters offer services for recent arrivals: real estate agents, lawyers and restaurants. The town's foreign population has doubled in the last year.
The high-tech factory town in the making in Kikuyo is evidence of the upheaval in the semiconductor business. For years, the supply chain for the tiny chips inside smartphones, cars and fighter jets depended largely on just a few factories in Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory. Then, the Covid-19 pandemic, Beijing's increasingly hostile posture toward Taiwan and a global chip shortage exposed the risks of such concentrated production.
In response, governments have pledged to spend billions to bring chip making to their shores. TSMC over the past four years has committed to build new fabs in the United States, Japan and Germany.
On Monday, the U.S. Commerce Department announced up to $ 6.6 billion in grants to TSMC that the company will use to build a third factory in Phoenix, in addition to the two facilities it has already committed to build there, federal officials said.
TSMC's American factories have been repeatedly delayed. And even though construction on the first factory began a full year later, the fab in Japan is already up and running and will be fully operational by the end of the year.
Japan, once a chip-making powerhouse, has committed $ 26 billion to revive the industry, with an emphasis on the chips used in cars. About a third of that money has gone to TSMC's operations. Japan's plans to build up the chip industry and supply chain will require tens of billions of dollars in additional public and private investment. Companies will need a surge of workers with the right skills, and they will need housing.
"Everyone could see the government's support for the entire ecosystem, especially the supply chain, including factories, construction, transportation and airports," said Ray Yang, a director at the Industrial Technology Research Institute, a Taiwan government-sponsored group that supports tech companies. including TSMC, in their early stages. This top-down push to efficiently set up the entire supply chain was indispensable, Mr. Yang said.
At rush hour in Kikuyo one day last month, the train platform at once-sleepy Haramizu station was crowded with workers from TSMC suppliers like Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron. Some carried hard hats in clear plastic backpacks while they waited for the train into Kumamoto, the nearest big city.
Ryuji Yamamoto was sent to Taiwan for six months of training last year and now works 12-hour shifts at the TSMC fab in Kikuyo. "I found it tough to get used to the long hours at first," he said. "But speed is the key in the semiconductor industry."
In recent months, thousands of workers labored around the clock in Kikuyo to build the TSMC fab and prepare the machines and materials for making chips.
On the February day when the fab opened its doors, ahead of schedule, the government said it would invest another $ 4.85 billion in a second factory.
Sony, which has been manufacturing in Kikuyo for more than 20 years, helped local officials draw TSMC there, according to Takatoshi Yoshimoto, the town's mayor.
TSMC brought over as many as 400 workers from Taiwan and is paying salaries that are roughly 30 percent higher than those at other manufacturing jobs in the area, prompting other businesses to raise wages. At the Kikuyo town office, fliers with dozens of classified ads call out for people to work in semiconductor factories or with their suppliers.
In Taiwan, where TSMC has built 15 fabs over 37 years, the company relies on an established network of suppliers, construction companies and skilled workers. It builds a new fab every few years to churn out ever smaller and faster chips.
Analysts said TSMC's experience in Japan showed that the company could recreate that pace outside Taiwan, even though it has struggled to do so in Arizona.
TSMC's factory in Phoenix has been under construction since April 2021. The next year, the company said it would also build another, bringing its commitment there to $ 40 billion. The first is slated to begin mass production next year and the second in 2027 or 2028.
"Even though we encountered some challenges in Arizona for our first fab construction, we are still the fastest player, from groundbreaking to equipment move-in," Mark Liu, TSMC's chairman, said in a statement. "We believe the construction of our second fab will be much smoother."
The company has said one challenge has been a shortage of skilled workers. Labor unions objected to TSMC's bringing in foreign workers for jobs that they said locals could do, setting off months of negotiations.
Many of the companies that have supplied chemicals and materials to TSMC for years are in Taiwan. For several, plans to set up shop in Arizona were on hold.
"Because it has announced delays, the suppliers are not sure how long TSMC will take to come up to speed," said Lita Shon-Roy, chief executive at Techcet, a chip material consultant.
No matter the outcome of TSMC's foreign ventures, the company will keep its most advanced output at home, Mr. Liu said in an interview last year.
Ensuring a pipeline of skilled workers is also a concern for TSMC in Japan. To get the factory up and running, some Japanese engineers from Sony were temporarily transferred to TSMC and sent to Taiwan for training. The local technical college in Kumamoto has ramped up electrical engineering courses, and TSMC has hired 17 of its graduates.
On a recent night in a tatami-paneled banquet hall in Kumamoto, the city 10 miles from the new TSMC factory, visiting investors from Taiwan exchanged gifts with their hosts, a local chamber of commerce. Bottles of Kirin beer, tiny glasses of sake, T-shirts and key chains were passed around and plates of sushi placed in front of each person. "To all the money we're going to make," went the final toast.
All the spending has set off a real estate boom. Prices are already going up, causing anxiety among some local residents. Investors have agreed to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on plots of farmland via video calls.
"There aren't any other places in Japan growing like this," said Shogo Okuda, an agent at housing developer Shichiro Kensetsu, who grew up in the area.
The TSMC workers come to Kikuyo from cities near the company's core production centers in Taiwan like Hsinchu and Tainan, which have some of the highest property values in Taiwan.
Many new arrivals have called Cake Liao, a Taiwanese property agent, looking for a home that is move-in ready and furnished, which is typical in urban Taiwan but not in rural Japan.
"They say, 'Just go to the Kumamoto area and find me something,"' Ms. Liao said at the dining room table in a model home. "This is the new Hsinchu."

Los Angeles Times Names First Woman as Top Editor
The Los Angeles Times on Monday named Terry Tang as its permanent executive editor, making her the first woman to lead the paper's newsroom.
Ms. Tang had been the interim executive editor since January, when Kevin Merida abruptly announced that he was leaving the organization after nearly three years as its executive editor.
In a statement, Patrick and Michele Soon-Shiong, who own The Los Angeles Times, said that they had made a decision in December to "make changes in leadership to revitalize The L.A. Times."
"Terry in short order has demonstrated the capability of building on our legacy of excellence in journalism with stories that matter," the Soon-Shiongs said.
Ms. Tang's appointment comes after a rocky time for the publication. Mr. Soon-Shiong said in January that the paper was losing up to $ 40 million a year and must cut its newsroom by over 20 percent. KATIE ROBERTSON

Toyota Moves to Regain Trust After Testing Scandal
Toyota will oversee model certification at its subsidiary Daihatsu to regain trust among dealers, customers and workers after a safety testing scandal, Daihatsu's new president said Monday.
Toyota will take a leadership role in various areas, including product development and procurement, said Masahiro Inoue, who took the helm of Daihatsu in March.
"I have been spending each and every day, vowing to revive Daihatsu," said Mr. Inoue, who previously oversaw Toyota's business in South America.
His predecessor at Daihatsu resigned after allegations of cheating on safety testing surfaced last year. A review found violations, such as testing just one side of a car instead of both, had persisted for decades.
Production at Daihatsu was halted by a government order until proper tests can be done.

REAL ESTATE
Blackstone to Purchase
Rental Firm for $ 10 Billion
Asset manager Blackstone said on Monday it would take private rental housing firm Apartment Income REIT, known as AIR Communities, for $ 10 billion in cash, including debt.
Under the deal, Blackstone will pay $ 39.12 for each share of the real estate investment trust, representing a premium of about 25 percent to its closing price on Friday. Shares of the REIT jumped about 23 percent.
Blackstone has been sharpening its focus on rental housing, betting on its revival as the supply of apartments in the U.S. is expected to decline because of a slowdown in construction.
This was likely to lift rental growth, which has over the past few months remained flat or declined modestly due to fresh supply in many U.S. markets.
AIR Communities, which has a diversified portfolio with apartments in markets on both coasts, has been largely insulated from such pressures. REUTERS

U.S. and Japan Aim to Strengthen Alliance: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Hovering over a state visit to Washington is the possibility of a swing in American foreign policy if Donald Trump returns to the White House.
When President Biden welcomes Japan's prime minister, Fumio Kishida, to Washington this week for a visit highlighted by the pomp of a state dinner, there will be an inescapable subtext to all the ceremony: Both leaders are in a fight to keep their jobs.
With Mr. Biden facing a tight re-election contest with his predecessor and Mr. Kishida's approval ratings falling to record lows amid a political scandal, the leaders are expected to discuss ways to entrench their countries' alliance so it remains strong even if they are no longer around to nurture it.
The goal is to "create a situation where no one can unbind their ties," said Narushige Michishita, a professor of international relations at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.
The risk of drastic change appears to be much higher on the American side. Japanese officials, lawmakers and media outlets have taken to referring to "moshi Tora" -- "if Trump" -- or even "hobo Tora," which roughly translates to "probably Trump," using an abbreviation of the name of the former president and current Republican candidate.
Given Donald J. Trump's unpredictable behavior and his transactional view of international alliances, Japanese officials are bracing for possible swings in American foreign policy.
On the Japanese side, even if Mr. Kishida does not survive a leadership election this fall in his own party, it will still control the government at least until the next general election and probably beyond that -- meaning any big changes in Tokyo's policy commitments are unlikely.
At the summit this week, during which Mr. Kishida will also address a joint session of Congress, the leaders are expected to talk about closer military cooperation between U.S. forces based in Japan and their Japanese counterparts; collaborations on artificial intelligence, space technology and semiconductors; and the potential for Japan to make and export more weapons to the United States.
The military cooperation in particular "smells of future proofing," said Tobias Harris, founder and principal of Japan Foresight, a political risk advisory firm in Washington.
During the Trump presidency, the relationship between the two countries withstood some turbulence as Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister at the time, went to great lengths to court Mr. Trump's favor.
Mr. Biden has worked with two Japanese leaders -- Yoshihide Suga, the successor to Mr. Abe, who was assassinated in 2022, and Mr. Kishida -- to restore and expand the alliance while also developing stronger bonds with other partners in Asia to counter China's rising power.
Last summer, Mr. Biden hosted Mr. Kishida and his South Korean counterpart, Yoon Suk Yeol, at the president's first meeting with foreign leaders at Camp David. This week, Mr. Biden and Mr. Kishida will meet with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Philippines in the first trilateral session among leaders of those three countries.
In an interview with foreign media outlets on Friday, Mr. Kishida said high-level talks between multiple partners were crucial given the "very complex and challenging security environment."
"Japan believes that it is important for peace and stability in the region to cooperate with the Philippines and other like-minded countries while maintaining the Japan-U.S. alliance as a cornerstone," Mr. Kishida said.
China, which has militarized islands in the South China Sea, clashed repeatedly with Philippine boats and pursued a strategy of squeezing Taiwan, has stopped short of a major confrontation that could draw in the United States and, by extension, Japan.
Mr. Biden hopes to consolidate a binding network of Pacific countries to deter Chinese aggression at a time when the United States is already entangled with wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
"The U.S. is obviously running thin in resources and diplomatic capital," said Mireya Solís, author of "Japan's Quiet Leadership: Reshaping the Indo-Pacific." "There is a desire to make sure that the alliance is fit for purpose" if there is a conflict in Asia.
For its part, Japan has made bold changes in defense policy after years of nominal pacifism, doubling the amount earmarked for military spending and acquiring Tomahawk missiles from the United States.
Late last year, Japan shifted postwar policies that restricted the export of weapons and agreed to sell American-designed Patriot missiles made in Japan to the U.S. government.
This week in Washington, Mr. Biden and Mr. Kishida are expected to discuss the formation of a joint defense council that would explore further exports, including additional Japanese-produced Patriots, cruise missiles and trainer jets used by fighter pilots, according to a senior American government official who requested anonymity to speak about details of the meeting. Japan could also cooperate with the United States to help repair American Navy ships so they do not have to leave the region for maintenance.
Beyond defense, an economic component to Mr. Kishida's visit -- an expected trip to a Toyota battery plant for electric vehicles in North Carolina -- may also be intended to offer a public reminder of Japan's investments in the United States.
Such reminders may be aimed particularly at Mr. Trump: In 2019, during a Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, Mr. Abe gave the president a one-page, colorful map that showed American investments by companies based in Japan, the largest foreign direct investor in the United States.
Without explicitly mentioning it, Japan may also be trying to exert pressure on the Biden administration to allow Nippon Steel, a Japanese corporation, to acquire U.S. Steel, the struggling manufacturer based in Pittsburgh.
Last month, Mr. Biden said in a statement that it was "vital" for U.S. Steel "to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated." White House officials have indicated that the administration will review the proposed deal for national security implications.
"The contrast between an administration raising national security concerns about a Japanese steel company buying an American steel company at the same time you're trying to raise military industrial cooperation -- the messaging is a little messy," said Mr. Harris, the Japan analyst.
If the deal does not go through, it could complicate business ties between the two countries, said Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former U.S. trade representative in Asia.
"The question is whether going forward this leaves a chilling effect in the eyes of other Japanese investors or, frankly, investors from other allies and partners," Ms. Cutler said.
Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, said the alliance between the two countries "runs a lot deeper and is a lot stronger and has a lot more strategic alignment than a single commercial deal."
With Congress stalled over extending American military assistance to Ukraine, Mr. Kishida's aides declined to say whether the prime minister would invoke Japan's support for Ukraine during his speech to American lawmakers this week.
But in the interview on Friday, Mr. Kishida said he would like to "express and acknowledge with President Biden the importance of continued efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine through unity among the G7 and other like-minded countries."
As for the ceremonial parts of the visit, no word yet on whether the prime minister will follow his South Korean counterpart by crooning an iconic American song at the state dinner on Wednesday.

Backer of $175 Million Bond Earned His Billions From Subprime Car Loans: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Don Hankey said his decision to help Mr. Trump post a $ 175 million bond was a business decision, though he voted for him in 2016.
The California billionaire Don Hankey made his fortune by offering high-interest auto loans to buyers with bad credit. This week, he signed up a new client in need of urgent help: Donald J. Trump.
A company operated by Mr. Hankey came to the former president's aid on Monday and provided a $ 175 million bond in Mr. Trump's New York civil fraud case, helping him avoid financial disaster. It was the first time one of Mr. Hankey's companies had done such a deal, and the State of New York has demanded the firm show its ability to provide the guarantee.
Mr. Hankey earned a reputation as a provider of risky and lucrative loans, specifically collateral-based debt that can be arranged more quickly than conventional loans and requires borrowers to pledge valuable assets. His companies are known for relentlessly calling people who miss payments by a day, and repossessing vehicles from delinquent borrowers, according to news accounts and regulators.
Now, Mr. Hankey's highest-profile client is running again for the White House and, if elected, could exert influence over federal regulation of his high-interest loan industry.
Mr. Hankey, 80, is in the public eye thanks to a New York judge's decision in February that Mr. Trump was liable for conspiring to manipulate his net worth. The judge imposed a $ 454 million judgment, a monumental penalty that jeopardized his business empire and raised the possibility that the state could seize some of Mr. Trump's buildings.
The former president appealed the judgment, and in the meantime a panel of five appellate court judges decided last week that Mr. Trump could post a far lower bond, $ 175 million.
Mr. Hankey said it had been an easy decision to provide the bond, a legal promise to cover a portion of the penalty if Mr. Trump loses his appeal and fails to pay. People seeking such bonds generally pay a fee to a bonding company and pledge collateral including as much cash as possible for the full amount of the judgment. Mr. Trump's $ 175 million in cash collateral is being handled on his behalf by a brokerage firm, which could invest it and gain interest for him, Mr. Hankey said.
Mr. Hankey said he did not mind how it was invested as long as it could be liquidated into cash on short notice.
"I looked at it as business, No. 1," Mr. Hankey said in an interview on Wednesday, "and No. 2, I was happy to help someone."
On Thursday, the New York attorney general's office questioned the qualifications of the company that provided the bond, Knight Specialty Insurance Company. The attorney general demanded that the firm or Mr. Trump's lawyers show within 10 days that the company is capable of fulfilling its obligation to pay the $ 175 million if Mr. Trump defaults.
While Mr. Hankey's companies had not previously provided an appellate bond, Mr. Hankey said the deal was not dissimilar from others underwritten by Knight. Mr. Hankey said he did not know the origins of Mr. Trump's cash but believed it was all his money.
He insisted that the arrangement was not motivated by politics, but that he had supported Mr. Trump before and would do so again in November. Mr. Hankey said he believed the judgment in the civil fraud case was "a bit unfair."
"We could care less if someone is a Republican or a Democrat," he said.
Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Hankey owns companies that have run afoul of regulators and have been accused of deceptive business practices.
In 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered two of his companies, Westlake Services L.L.C. and Wilshire Consumer Credit, to refund customers $ 44 million and pay a $ 4.2 million fine for deceiving customers. In 2022, another firm, Westlake Financial, agreed to pay $ 225,000 to settle allegations that it had, in violation of federal law, repossessed at least 70 vehicles from members of the United States military who had been called up for active duty.
Mr. Hankey said his companies had corrected past practices. "We have 1.5 million customers, so it's hard not to make mistakes, but obviously we try to minimize the mistakes we make," he said.
Richard Painter, who served as the chief ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush and ran as a Democrat for Congress, said he was "very, very concerned" about a major player in the loan industry helping Mr. Trump and the lack of details about the bond, including whether other people were involved in providing the cash collateral.
Mr. Painter said he was worried that Mr. Hankey could ask for favors from Mr. Trump if he were re-elected. "He has got a lot of leverage," Mr. Painter said, "and if Donald Trump is back in the White House, we know exactly what he wants, and that is for Trump to just shut down C.F.P.B."
Mr. Hankey said that he would not lobby Mr. Trump if he were president. "Regulation is fine if it's not overdone," he said.
Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Hankey is a billionaire, according to Forbes, with wealth estimated at $ 7.4 billion. His companies are based in Southern California and include Westlake Financial, one of the country's largest providers of subprime and near-subprime loans; North Hollywood Toyota, a dealership in Los Angeles County; and Hankey Investment Company, a real estate firm.
Forbes has called Mr. Hankey the "little-known king of subprime car loans."
His offer to help Mr. Trump came together over several weeks after the New York judge issued his final ruling in February ordering the former president to pay the $ 454 million judgment. Mr. Hankey said he had been talking to his wife, Debbi, about the ruling when the conversation shifted to how one of his companies could help.
Ms. Hankey knew someone close to Mr. Trump and made contact with that person, whom Mr. Hankey declined to identify. That led to negotiations between executives at Knight and representatives for Mr. Trump, including Alan Garten, executive vice president and general counsel for the Trump Organization.
While Mr. Trump's lawyers said in a court filing last month that he faced "insurmountable difficulties" in raising a bond for the full penalty, Mr. Hankey said on Wednesday that his company had been discussing possible terms to secure the full $ 454 million.
He said that would have carried far more risk, requiring Mr. Trump to provide not only cash as collateral but also some of his real estate.

Ford Throttles Back on Electric Vehicles: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The automaker said it would delay new battery-powered models and shift its focus to hybrid cars, sales of which are rising fast.
Ford Motor on Thursday delayed the production of at least two new electric cars and said it would pivot to making more hybrids. Its decision was the latest sign that large automakers have been forced to rethink their strategy for electric vehicles because sales for those models are slowing.
The shift by Ford and automakers like General Motors and Mercedes-Benz, which have also pushed back their electric car plans, has been prompted largely by the companies' difficulties in making and selling enough electric cars and doing so profitably.
Sales of such vehicles are still growing, but the pace has slowed sharply in recent months as automakers have tapped out many of the early adopters who were willing to spend more than $ 50,000 on a new battery-powered car. Because they are still learning how to make the cars and their batteries at lower cost, the companies have not been able to bring out more affordable models.
"Many companies rushed in too fast with E.V.s that were too expensive and there was not as much of a market for them as they thought," Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for transportation and mobility at the research firm Guidehouse Insights, said. "That's made it a lot tougher to sell those vehicles."
Some consumers are also reluctant to buy electric models because they can't charge the vehicles at home or are worried that there won't be enough public chargers available when they want to travel more than a couple of hundred miles.
Many car buyers interested in electric vehicles appear to be choosing hybrid cars, which can cost just a few hundred dollars more than comparable gasoline-only models and in some cases offer much better fuel economy. Those cars are also easier for consumers to get used to because they don't have to be plugged in and are fueled like conventional models.
Andy Goodrich, a retired software engineer in Ann Arbor, Mich., was considering buying a Tesla Model 3 or a Rivian sport-utility vehicle, but had concerns about finding charging stations. Ultimately, he chose a Toyota RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid, which can go about 40 miles on electric power alone before switching to a gasoline engine.
"I do most of my driving locally, so I can go a week or more without using any gas," Mr. Goodrich, 72, said. "I charge in my garage overnight and I'm all set for the day. If I have to go to Grand Rapids or something, then the gas engine gets me there."
Ford said on Thursday that it hoped to offer a hybrid version of every model it sold by the end of the decade. It already makes hybrid versions of two pickups -- the Maverick and the F-150 -- and its Escape crossover.
The company said it was now planning to start making a large electric S.U.V. at its plant in Oakville, Ontario, in 2027, two years later than it had planned. A plant that Ford is building in Tennessee will start making an electric pickup truck in 2026, a year later than originally scheduled.
"We are committed to scaling a profitable E.V. business, using capital wisely and bringing to market the right gas, hybrid and fully electric vehicles at the right time," Ford's chief executive, Jim Farley, said in a statement.
Ford has set up a small team in Irvine, Calif. -- far from the company's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich. -- to develop components that can be used to produce lower-cost electric vehicles. That group is led by a former Tesla executive, Alan Clarke.
"We're also adjusting our capital, switching more focus onto smaller E.V. products," Mr. Farley said in a conference call in February. Ford's electric vehicle business lost $ 4.7 billion before interest and taxes in 2023. By contrast, the division that makes gasoline and hybrid vehicles for consumers made a $ 7.5 billion profit.
The slowdown in sales is also hurting the leading maker of electric models in the United States, Tesla. This week it reported an unexpected 8.5 percent decrease in sales of its electric cars in the first three months of the year.
On Wednesday, Ford said its sales of electric vehicles had grown 86 percent in the quarter, to 20,223 vehicles, but the total was well below the level the company once hoped to reach and came after it cut some prices.
The company sold more than 7,700 F-150 Lightning pickups, its flagship electric model, in the three months. As recently as last summer, Ford hoped to be able to produce some 150,000 Lightnings trucks a year. The company recently reduced Lightning production to one shift per day from two.
Two years ago, Ford, G.M., Volkswagen and other automakers were planning to introduce dozens of new electric cars and trucks, expecting consumers to make a rapid transition to electric vehicles from gasoline-powered vehicles.
But starting in the second half of 2023, the growth in electric sales decreased significantly, forcing manufacturers to scale back their ambitions. Ford and G.M. have also slowed work on factories that are supposed to supply battery packs for their new electric models.

Ford Motor Co. on Thursday delayed the production of at least two new electric cars and said it would pivot to making more hybrids. Its decision was the latest sign that large automakers have been forced to rethink their strategy for electric vehicles because sales for those models are slowing.
The shift by Ford and automakers such as General Motors and Mercedes-Benz, which have also pushed back their electric car plans, has been prompted largely by the companies’ difficulties in making and selling enough electric cars and doing so profitably.
Sales of such vehicles are still growing but the pace has slowed sharply in recent months as automakers have tapped out many of the early adopters who were willing to spend more than $50,000 on a new battery-powered car. Because they are still learning how to make the cars and their batteries at lower cost, the companies have not been able to bring out more affordable models.
“Many companies rushed in too fast with EVs that were too expensive and there was not as much of a market for them as they thought,” said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for transportation and mobility at the research firm Guidehouse Insights. “That’s made it a lot tougher to sell those vehicles.”
Some consumers are also reluctant to buy electric models because they can’t charge the vehicles at home or are worried that there won’t be enough public chargers available when they want to travel more than a couple hundred miles.
Many car buyers interested in electric vehicles appear to be choosing hybrid cars, which can cost just a few hundred dollars more than comparable gasoline-only models and in some cases offer much better fuel economy. Those cars are also easier for consumers to get used to because they don’t have to be plugged in and are fueled like conventional models.
Andy Goodrich, a retired software engineer in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was considering buying a Tesla Model 3 or a Rivian sport utility vehicle, but he had concerns about finding charging stations. Ultimately, he chose a Toyota RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid, which can go about 40 miles on electric power alone before switching to a gasoline engine.

Tesla's Grip On Market Is in Doubt As Sales Slip: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sales of the company's electric cars dropped in the first three months of the year, even as other automakers sold more battery-powered vehicles.
Tesla appeared to be losing command of the market it effectively created after it reported a stunning drop in quarterly sales on Tuesday, raising fresh questions about Elon Musk's leadership of the company.
The sales decline caught investors off guard as rivals like BYD of China and Kia and Hyundai of South Korea reported increases in electric vehicle sales, suggesting that slower overall demand for battery-powered models was not the only explanation for Tesla's problems.
Tesla pioneered the market for electric vehicles with its Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle, which proved that battery-powered cars could be appealing, practical and profitable. The cars revolutionized the auto industry and forced established carmakers to develop their own electric models.
But the market is evolving in ways that may not favor Tesla. In contrast to the early adopters who fueled Tesla's rise, mainstream buyers may be put off by the vehicles' unconventional design, including minimalist interiors and lack of buttons and switches. Almost all functions in Tesla vehicles are controlled from a large screen on the dashboard.
The system "makes it thoroughly distracting to adjust almost anything within the vehicle while motoring down the road," Consumer Reports wrote in a review on Tuesday of a new version of the Model 3.
Tesla, which sells cars online and does not have many showrooms, is often the target of complaints about poor service. That may provide an advantage to established carmakers, like Ford Motor and General Motors, that have extensive dealer networks and are ramping up production of electric vehicles.
Tesla seems at a loss to respond to those challenges. It has been slow to follow up its initial success with new models, and Mr. Musk appears disengaged. He did not react Tuesday to the sales figures on X, the social media platform that he owns and posts on prolifically. Instead, he threw barbs at Walt Disney Company executives whom he accuses of being "woke." Such remarks have made him a hero to conservatives but may be pushing liberals, who are more likely to buy electric cars, away from Tesla.
Tesla said it delivered 387,000 cars worldwide in the first quarter, down 8.5 percent from 423,000 in the same period last year. This was the first time Tesla's quarterly sales have fallen on a year over year basis since a modest drop at the start of the pandemic in 2020. The sales figures were also significantly lower than the estimates of Wall Street analysts who had expected a modest increase.
"Tesla can't stand still," Ben Rose, president of Battle Road Research, said in an email. "Chinese E.V.s are already gaining a foothold in Europe, and it is unclear how long they will be forbidden from entering the U.S."
More affordable cars would help Tesla appeal to a broader spectrum of buyers, Mr. Rose said.
To be sure, some of the sales decline may have reflected production problems beyond the company's control, including a fire at a Tesla factory near Berlin that was the result of an arson attack.
And the company's cars still have many fans. While panning the Model 3's controls, Consumer Reports said the latest version provided a better ride than its predecessor and had improved handling.
But investors are clearly alarmed. Tesla's shares have fallen more than 30 percent this year -- including a 5 percent drop on Tuesday -- because of concern that the company has lost momentum.
In China, Tesla faces BYD and dozens of other rivals with ambitions to expand worldwide. In Europe, established carmakers like Volkswagen and BMW have introduced more compelling battery-powered models. And in the United States, sales of electric cars are not growing as fast as they were a year ago, and many buyers are opting instead for hybrid models that pair a gasoline engine with batteries and electric motors.
Tesla rivals have continued to report sales increases. BYD said on Tuesday that it sold about 300,000 electric vehicles, up 13 percent from a year earlier. The company also sold 324,000 plug-in hybrid vehicles in the first quarter, up 15 percent.
BYD and other Chinese automakers have introduced new models rapidly, often undercutting Tesla on price. Those companies are also increasingly exporting cars to Europe, Southeast Asia and Latin America.
Kia, based in South Korea, said Tuesday that its sales of electric vehicles in the United States more than doubled in the first three months of the year compared with a year earlier after it introduced a new large sport utility vehicle, the EV9. Kia's sister company, Hyundai, said it sold more than 10,000 electric vehicles in the first quarter in the United States, up 75 percent.
Toyota, the world's largest automaker, doesn't sell many fully electric vehicles. But the company said U.S. sales of electrified vehicles, a category largely made up of hybrids, under the Toyota and Lexus brands was up 74 percent in the first quarter.
Tesla pioneered mass-market electric cars, but its lineup is aging. The company's only new model since 2020 is the Cybertruck, a futuristic pickup that went on sale in limited numbers last year. The least expensive version that Tesla says it can deliver this year starts at around $ 80,000, which makes it unaffordable to most car buyers.
Rivian, whose R1 pickup competes with the Cybertruck, said its sales, including of the truck and its two other models, rose 70 percent in the quarter, to 13,600 vehicles.
Tesla is working on an electric car that would cost around $ 25,000, but the model is not expected to go on sale in large numbers until 2026. In the meantime, Tesla remains dependent on the Model Y and the Model 3 for most of its sales.
The company has repeatedly cut prices, but analysts say the strategy has lowered its profits without doing enough to stimulate sales. The company has recently modestly raised the prices of some cars in the United States and China. The Model Y starts at nearly $ 45,000 before federal and state tax breaks, after an increase of $ 1,000 announced this week.
The quarterly sales figure shows Tesla managers "they need a real sales strategy and can't rely on cutting price alone," Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, an investment firm, posted on X.
Mr. Musk, Tesla's chief executive, has not given a clear indication of how the company plans to regain momentum. At the same time, his polarizing statements and endorsement of right-wing conspiracy theories have alienated many of the left-leaning customers who are most likely to buy electric cars.
Raphaelle Cassens, a Los Angeles resident, gave up her leased Tesla Model Y last year and replaced it with a leased electric BMW i4. Mr. Musk was one reason she switched, she said.
"Honestly, I don't like him as an individual at all," said Ms. Cassens, who is a registered Democrat but described herself as nonpartisan. She also said she received poor service from the company. "The attitude from the company definitely reflects the owner," Ms. Cassens added.
At least one other large automaker is also struggling with electric vehicle sales. G.M. reported on Tuesday that its U.S. sales for the first quarter fell 1.5 percent, in large part because deliveries of battery-powered cars were down by about a fifth to around 16,000 vehicles.
The drop in battery-powered vehicle sales was the result of a sharp decline in sales of the Chevrolet Bolt, which G.M. stopped making at the end of 2023. Sales of other electric models that use G.M.'s newest battery technology rose but not enough to make up for the loss of the Bolt, which was one of the most affordable electric cars in the United States.

Africa's Youngest President Takes Office, Pledging 'Systemic Change': [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Senegal's new president, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, took the oath of office in Tuesday's ceremony. Close behind him sat the popular opposition leader who had clinched the win.
Still reeling from a whirlwind campaign, young people in Senegal threw jackets over their worn election T-shirts on Tuesday to attend the inauguration of an opposition politician who went from political prisoner to president in less than three weeks.
Their new leader, Bassirou Diomaye Faye -- at 44, Africa's youngest elected president -- took the oath of office promising "systemic change," and paying homage to the many people killed, injured, and imprisoned in the yearslong lead-up to the West African country's election.
"I will always keep in mind the heavy sacrifices made so as to never disappoint you," Mr. Faye said, addressing a vast auditorium in which African heads of state and dignitaries sat at the front. From the back, hundreds of supporters of Mr. Faye and his powerful backer, the opposition leader Ousmane Sonko, shouted for joy.
Hours later, Mr. Faye appointed Mr. Sonko prime minister in the new government, according to a post on the president's official account on X.
It was the culmination of months of drama, after the former president, Macky Sall, canceled the election with just weeks to go, citing irregularities at the constitutional council -- and then, under intense domestic and international pressure, agreed to hold it after all.
Mr. Sall's handpicked candidate was resoundingly beaten by Mr. Faye, a tax inspector and political rookie who got more than 54 percent of the vote, despite having only 10 days of freedom in which to campaign. He had been jailed on charges of defamation and contempt of court, and was awaiting trial when Mr. Sall announced the adoption of an amnesty law and was released.
"You're Senegal's uncontested and dazzling choice," said the president of the constitutional council, Mamadou Badio Camara, presiding over the inauguration.
But Mr. Faye was not the only politician that Senegal had effectively endorsed. Mr. Sonko, the man whose support helped get Mr. Faye elected, was sitting in the second row.
"Thank you, Sonko, thank you," yelled his supporters at key moments in Tuesday's ceremony.
Mr. Sonko, until now Senegal's foremost opposition leader, was also in jail until three weeks ago, barred from running for president himself after convictions on charges of defamation and "corruption of youth" in relation to accusations brought by a young massage parlor employee.
When he was released, he immediately went on the campaign trail with Mr. Faye, telling his supporters that a vote for Mr. Faye was a vote for him.
Mr. Faye made no mention in his speech of Mr. Sonko, who cut a low profile in a black hat and tunic. But Mr. Sonko was a constant presence. He hobnobbed with the African presidents who waited for the ceremony to begin in an antechamber of a conference center in Diamniadio, a new city still under construction and a pet project of Mr. Sall.
Then, in the hangar-like room where Mr. Faye would take his oath, Mr. Sonko took his place in the second row, just behind the two first ladies -- wives of the polygamous new president. And Mr. Sonko got the biggest cheers of the day, every time his face appeared on the large screens at the front of the auditorium.
Much cheering also rang out for the military president of Guinea, and the representatives of Mali and Burkina Faso, three West African countries whose governments were overthrown in coups in recent years and are now ruled by juntas. The rhetoric of those juntas -- focused on sovereignty from France, the former colonial power perceived by many West Africans as continuing to meddle in their affairs -- mirrors that of Mr. Sonko and Mr. Faye.
"The youth of Senegal is connecting with the youth of those countries, over these issues of sovereignty," the president's uncle, also named Diomaye Faye, said in an interview on Tuesday.
Mr. Faye and Mr. Sonko have pledged to drop or change the terms of the CFA, the regional currency backed by France, and renegotiate Senegal's contracts with foreign-owned companies to extract newly-discovered oil and gas.
In his speech, Mr. Faye stressed that Senegal would remain open to relations with other countries that are "respectful of our sovereignty, consistent with our people's aspirations, and in a mutually winning partnership."
After the swearing-in, a motorcade carried him to the presidential palace. Last week, Mr. Sall had welcomed him and Mr. Sonko, his former archrivals, in a stiff but determinedly friendly meeting -- official photographs of which were later given to the media.
On Tuesday, Mr. Sall, a two-term president who had served for 12 years, welcomed Mr. Faye once more, who arrived this time with a presidential guard.
After sitting chatting for a while and handing over the important documents, Mr. Sall climbed into a Toyota, pulling out of the palace gates and leaving for good.

And in the United States, sales of electric cars are not growing as fast as they were a year ago, and many buyers are opting instead for hybrid models that pair a gasoline engine with batteries and electric motors.
Tesla rivals have continued to report sales increases. BYD said Tuesday that it sold about 300,000 electric vehicles, up 13% from a year earlier. The company also sold 324,000 plug-in hybrid vehicles in the first quarter, up 15%.
BYD and other Chinese automakers have introduced new models rapidly, often undercutting Tesla on price. Those companies are also increasingly exporting cars to Europe, Southeast Asia and Latin America.
Kia, based in South Korea, said Tuesday that its sales of electric vehicles in the United States more than doubled in the first three months of the year compared with a year earlier after it introduced a new large SUV, the EV9. Kia’s sister company, Hyundai, said it sold more than 10,000 electric vehicles in the first quarter in the United States, up 75%.
Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, doesn’t sell many fully electric vehicles. But the company said U.S. sales of electrified vehicles, a category largely made up of hybrids, under the Toyota and Lexus brands was up 74% in the first quarter.
Tesla pioneered mass-market electric cars, but its lineup is aging. The company’s only new model since 2020 is the Cybertruck, a futuristic pickup that went on sale in limited numbers last year. The least expensive version Tesla says it can deliver this year starts at around $80,000, which makes it unaffordable to most car buyers.
Rivian, whose R1 pickup competes with the Cybertruck, said its sales, including of the truck and its two other models, rose 70% in the quarter, to 13,600 vehicles.
Tesla is working on an electric car that would cost around $25,000, but the model is not expected to go on sale in large numbers until 2026. In the meantime, Tesla remains dependent on the Model Y and the Model 3 for most of its sales.
The company has repeatedly cut prices, but analysts say the strategy has lowered its profits without doing enough to stimulate sales. The company has recently modestly raised the prices of some cars in the United States and China. The Model Y starts at nearly $45,000 before federal and state tax breaks, after an increase of $1,000 announced this week.
The quarterly sales figure shows Tesla managers “they need a real sales strategy and can’t rely on cutting price alone,” Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, an investment firm, posted on X.
Musk has not given a clear indication of how Tesla plans to regain momentum. At the same time, his polarizing statements and endorsement of right-wing conspiracy theories have alienated many of the left-leaning customers who are most likely to buy electric cars.
Raphaelle Cassens, a Los Angeles resident, gave up her leased Tesla Model Y last year and replaced it with a leased electric BMW i4. Musk was one reason she switched, she said.
“Honestly, I don’t like him as an individual at all,” said Cassens, who is a registered Democrat but described herself as nonpartisan. She also said she received poor service from the company. “The attitude from the company definitely reflects the owner,” Cassens added.
At least one other large automaker is also struggling with electric vehicle sales. GM reported Tuesday that its U.S. sales for the first quarter fell 1.5%, in large part because deliveries of battery-powered cars were down by about one-fifth to around 16,000 vehicles.
The drop in battery-powered vehicle sales was the result of a sharp decline in sales of the Chevrolet Bolt, which GM stopped making at the end of 2023. Sales of other electric models that use GM’s newest battery technology rose but not enough to make up for the loss of the Bolt, which was one of the most affordable electric cars in the United States.

Taking the SAT Changed My Life: [Op-Ed]

Full text: This month, the University of Texas, Austin, joined the wave of selective schools reversing Covid-era test-optional admissions policies, once again requiring applicants to submit ACT or SAT scores.
Many colleges have embraced the test-optional rule under the assumption that it bolsters equity and diversity, since higher scores are correlated with privilege. But it turns out that these policies harmed the teenagers they were supposed to help. Many low-income and minority applicants withheld scores that could have gotten them in, wrongly assuming that their scores were too low, according to an analysis by Dartmouth. More top universities are sure to join the reversal. This is a good thing.
I was one of the disadvantaged youths who are often failed by test-optional policies, striving to get into college while in foster care and homeless. We hear a lot about the efforts of these elite schools to attract diverse student bodies and about debates around the best way to assemble a class. What these conversations overlook is the hope these tests offer students who are in difficult situations.
For many of us, standardized tests provided our one shot to prove our potential, despite the obstacles in our lives or the untidy pasts we had. We found solace in the objectivity of a hard number and a process that -- unlike many things in our lives -- we could control. I will always feel tenderness toward the Scantron sheets that unlocked higher education and a better life.
Growing up, I fantasized about escaping the chaos of my family for the peace of a grassy quad. Both my parents had mental health issues. My adolescence was its own mess. Over two years I took a dozen psychiatric drugs while attending four different high school programs. At 14, I was sent to a locked facility where my education consisted of work sheets and reading aloud in an on-site classroom. In a life skills class, we learned how to get our G.E.D.s. My college dreams began to seem like delusions.
Then one afternoon a staff member handed me a library copy of "Barron's Guide to the ACT." I leafed through the onionskin pages and felt a thunderclap of possibility. I couldn't go to the bathroom without permission, let alone take Advanced Placement Latin or play water polo or do something else that would impress elite colleges. But I could teach myself the years of math I'd missed while switching schools and improve my life in this one specific way.
After nine months in the institution, I entered foster care. I started my sophomore year at yet another high school, only to have my foster parents shuffle my course load at midyear, when they decided Advanced Placement classes were bad for me. In part because of academic instability like this, only 3 percent to 4 percent of former foster youth get a four-year college degree.
Later I bounced between friends' sofas and the back seat of my rusty Corolla, using my new-to-me SAT prep book as a pillow. I had no idea when I'd next shower, but I could crack open practice problems and dip into a meditative trance. For those moments, everything was still, the terror of my daily life softened by the fantasy that my efforts might land me in a dorm room of my own, with endless hot water and an extra-long twin bed.
Standardized tests allowed me to look forward, even as every other part of college applications focused on the past. The song and dance of personal statements required me to demonstrate all the obstacles I'd overcome while I was still in the middle of them. When shilling my trauma left me gutted and raw, researching answer elimination strategies was a balm. I could focus on equations and readings, like the scholar I wanted to be, rather than the desperate teenager that I was.
Test-optional policies would have confounded me, but in the 2009-10 admissions cycle, I had to submit my scores; my fellow hopefuls and I were all in this together, slogging through multiple-choice questions until our backs ached and our eyes crossed.
The hope these exams instilled in me wasn't abstract: It manifested in hundreds of glossy brochures. After I took the PSAT in my junior year, universities that had received my score flooded me with letters urging me to apply. For once, I felt wanted. These marketing materials informed me that the top universities offered generous financial aid that would allow me to attend free. I set my sights higher, despite my guidance counselor's lack of faith.
When I took the actual SAT, I was ashamed of my score. Had submitting it been optional, I most likely wouldn't have done it, because I suspected my score was lower than the prep-school applicants I was up against (exactly what Dartmouth found in the analysis that led it to reinstate testing requirements). When you grow up the way I did, it's difficult to believe that you are ever good enough.
When I got into Harvard, it felt like a miracle splitting my life into a before and after. My exam preparation paid off on campus -- it was the only reason I knew geometry or grammar -- and it motivated me to tackle new, difficult topics. I majored in computer science, having never written a line of code. Though a career as a software engineer seemed far-fetched, I used my SAT study strategies to prepare for technical interviews (in which you're given one or more problems to solve) that landed me the stable, lucrative Google job that catapulted me out of financial insecurity.
I'm not the only one who feels affection for these tests. At Harvard, I met other students who saw these exams as the one door they could unlock that opened into a new future. I was lucky that the tests offered me hope all along, that I could cling to the promise that one day I could bubble in a test form and find myself transported into a better life -- the one I lead today.

How Toyota Landed on Top With Its Hybrid Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The auto giant lobbied hard against tougher pollution rules. This week, the E.P.A.'s new rules proved favorable to hybrid technology, an area that Toyota dominates.
The breakfast at Toyota's annual dealership gathering in Las Vegas last fall was an exclusive, invite-only affair, where attendees were told to cover their cellphone cameras with red stickers.
Speaking was Stephen Ciccone, Toyota's top lobbyist. He said the industry was facing an existential crisis -- not because of the economy or fuel prices, but because of stronger tailpipe pollution limits being proposed in the United States. The rules were "bad for the country, bad for the consumer, and bad for the auto industry," he said, according to a memo he later circulated among Toyota dealerships that was reviewed by The New York Times.
"For more than two years, Toyota and our dealer partners have stood alone in the fight against unrealistic BEV mandates," he wrote, using the acronym for battery-electric vehicles. "We have taken a lot of hits from environmental activists, the media, and some politicians. But we have not -- and we will not -- back down."
On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized tailpipe emissions rules that require car makers to meet tough new average emissions limits. The rules are some of the most significant aimed at fighting climate change in United States history.
But the rules relaxed major elements of an earlier, more stringent proposal. In particular, the final regulations were favorable to hybrid cars, those that run both on gasoline and electricity -- giving a bigger role to a market that Toyota dominates.
Toyota, it appeared, had come out on top.
Once a leader in clean cars, Toyota has cemented its role as the voice of caution against electrifying the auto industry too quickly, using its lobbying and public relations muscle to oppose a rapid shift that experts say is critical to fighting climate change.
That's a significant change for an auto maker that pioneered hybrid technology in the late 1990s, giving the world the Prius, a high-mileage vehicle embraced by early adopters of cleaner cars.
But in more recent years, Toyota has bet on a continued role for hybrids and gasoline cars, as well as vehicles powered by hydrogen, not batteries, seemingly leaving Toyota in a bind as sales of electric cars began rising quickly.
In a statement on Friday, Toyota said it has long maintained that "the best way to reduce carbon emissions as much as possible, as soon as possible, is to give consumers a variety of choices to meet their needs."
Toyota sided with President Donald J. Trump in 2019 against an effort by California to impose stricter car emissions rules. And it has opposed policies around the world to compel automakers to switch to selling electric vehicles.
Toyota also stood out among its automaker peers in strongly opposing tailpipe rules proposed by the Biden administration last year, which require carmakers to meet tough new average emissions limits across their product lines. Ford, for example, sought to push back some of the compliance dates, even as it largely agreed to the overall numbers.
Toyota objected altogether. The rules were "arbitrary and capricious," based on "error-filled data sets," and would impose "significant costs" on gasoline vehicles, the automaker said in comments on the proposed rules. Battery supply chains, vehicle charging infrastructure, and car buyers weren't ready for electric vehicles, the company said.
In January, Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda said he believed electric vehicles would reach a 30 percent market share at best, with the rest of the market taken up by hybrids, hydrogen fuel-cell cars and gasoline-burning vehicles.
"When we think about Toyota, people think it's technologically great, and green -- and they deserved that," said Margo T. Oge, former director of the E.P.A.'s Office of Transportation Air Quality who has advised both automakers and environmental groups on clean-car policy. But more recently, she said, Toyota "has been using all kinds of strategies to delay."
Toyota said that it had steadily called on the E.P.A. to provide greater flexibility to meet the regulations. And it said its argument had prevailed, noting that several companies have recently announced plans to offer more hybrids rather than electric cars. "It appears that the industry has moved toward the position Toyota has consistently held," it said.
It also called the E.P.A.'s final rules "aggressive" and said big challenges remain in meeting them.
In spreading its message, Toyota harnessed the power of dealerships both through Mr. Ciccone's outreach to Toyota dealers, and by other means. The company's dealerships played a role, for example, in garnering support for a separate letter-writing campaign aimed at urging the Biden administration to exercise caution on electric vehicles, according to two people with knowledge of that effort. Toyota dealers in at least two states circulated the letter at dealership meetings, they said.
That effort culminated in a letter to President Biden, in January, from nearly 4,000 car dealerships in 50 states, complaining of poor sales of electric cars and urging the administration to "tap the brakes" on its push for more battery-powered vehicles.
The letter came in for scrutiny, however, after some dealers who appeared in it claimed that they never signed on. Among them was Duncan Roberts, majority owner of Swedish automaker Polestar's Portland dealership "It's embarrassing. I didn't approve it," he said in an interview.
Toyota said the list had been "generated by dealer-to-dealer contact," and that it didn't believe Toyota dealerships played any outsized role.
Electric-vehicle sales have slowed in recent months, but are still growing much faster than sales of vehicles that burn fossil fuels. Nonetheless, the dealers' letter provided ammunition to other foes of stricter pollution standards.
The American Fuel Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents the nation's biggest gasoline producers, has urged congress to support a Republican-sponsored bill that would restrict the E.P.A.'s ability to regulate car emissions, citing the letter. During the Trump administration, the group also ran a covert campaign to rewrite clean-car rules.
Toyota has said it is investing more than $ 17 billion in electrifying its fleet, a figure that includes investments in both hybrids and electric vehicles, and has released one electric car model in the United States. But Toyota dominates in hybrids, with a roughly 40 percent share of the market in the United States, giving it an incentive to keep hybrids mainstream, analysts say. It invested heavily in the technology; early on Toyota lost money on its Priuses for a decade, before starting to turn a profit on hybrids in 2001.
And hybrids are now selling well, as some buyers shy away from buying fully battery-powered cars out of concerns about "range anxiety" -- that they'll run out of power or not be able to find convenient places to charge up.
The revised E.P.A. rules announced earlier this week "work for automakers who invest heavily in hybrids," said Mark Schirmer, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, a research firm. "And certainly Toyota is leading the way there."
Toyota has also sought to make a business of supplying other automakers with its hybrid technology, offering some of its patents at no charge, with the hope that rivals turn to Toyota for its expertise and to source parts.
Toyota's focus on producing hybrids, rather than fully battery-powered cars, is also better for the environment, the company has argued.
Mr. Ciccone, the Toyota lobbyist, laid out that reasoning in his memo to dealers: The amount of rare minerals needed to make one electric vehicle takes only one gasoline vehicle off the road. But that same amount could supply six plug-in hybrids that require an outlet, or 90 hybrid cars that don't need to be plugged in, he said. And, he said, China's dominance of the battery supply chain was a major concern.
"It's a no brainer" to prioritize hybrids over electric vehicles, Mr. Ciccone said in the letter.
Some experts dispute the numbers. Rachel Muncrief, acting executive director of the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization, said Toyota assumed a mineral-supply crunch that hasn't materialized because of improved battery technology and other changes.
Electric vehicles emit far fewer greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants, studies have shown, when taking into account manufacturing and their lifetime use. "There's no competition," she said.
Gil Tal, director of the Electric Vehicle Research Center at the University of California, Davis's Institute of Transportation Studies, said that while hybrids were "very efficient on lowering emissions a little bit, they're not very effective in bringing us to zero emissions in the long run."
Toyota's math has won supporters. GreenerCars, which recently assessed the emissions from 1,200 cars available for purchase this year, gave its highest rating to Toyota's Prius "plug-in" hybrid, which means it can be charged up from a power outlet but can also run on its gasoline engine. Experts point out, however, that how clean a plug-in hybrid is can vary widely depending on how often it's driven as a gasoline car, versus powered by electricity.
Some of the changes to the E.P.A.'s car-pollution rule appeared to be based on new data suggesting that plug-in hybrids are driven more on battery power today than in the past, which would make them cleaner. Toyota had said it would share such data with the administration, and the E.P.A. on Friday said Toyota's submissions had been reviewed and considered in making its rules.
Dr. Tal of U.C. Davis said it was clear the car companies were in a tough place. "They're taking on the highest risk with this transition to electric vehicles," he said. "So I understand their pushback, I understand why they're nervous about it."

Volkswagen Workers Plan Vote on Joining U.A.W.
Workers at Volkswagen's factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., will vote next month on whether they want to be represented by the United Auto Workers union.
The National Labor Relations Board said Monday that the election will take place from April 17 to 19 at the plant, in the first test of the union's effort to organize nonunion automobile factories across the nation.
Workers at the 3.8 million square foot factory with more than 4,000 production workers filed paperwork March 18 seeking the election.
The U.A.W. announced its organizing campaign last fall after it won strong contracts with Detroit automakers. The U.A.W. said it would simultaneously target more than a dozen nonunion auto plants including those run by Tesla, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, Honda, and others. Associated Press

Nissan Aims to Expand Stable of Electric Vehicles
Nissan will expand its electric vehicle lineup, develop more powerful batteries and cut production costs, while speeding up the process, in what the Japanese auto maker's chief called "The Arc" pathway to higher sales by 2030.
"The auto industry is now being forced to reshape its values so we can say continuous change is the new normal," Makoto Uchida, Nissan's chief executive said on Monday in outlining an ambitious business plan. "Nissan must change. We cannot succeed if we continue along the same path."
Costs will come down for electric models so they'll be about the same as gasoline models by fiscal 2030, while global sales will grow by a million vehicles during that period, he added.
Last year, Nissan Motor Co. sold nearly 3.4 million vehicles around the world, up about 5 percent from the previous year.
The company is planning 30 new models over the next three years, 16 of them E.V.s. Nissan plans to launch 34 E.V. models from fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2030. Associated Press
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Ericsson to Lay Off 1,200 Over Lagging 5G Sales
Ericsson said on Monday that it would lay off about 1,200 employees in Sweden as part of cost-cutting measures announced this year as customers reduce their spending on 5G gear.
After cutting thousands of staff last year, telecoms equipment suppliers like Ericsson and Finland's Nokia are expecting 2024 to remain challenging as 5G equipment sales slow in North America and are also expected to ease from record levels in India.
Ericsson told Reuters in January it could look at further cost cuts this year including layoffs.
Citing ongoing negotiations with unions, the company declined to give a figure for how much it could save by cutting staff.
The company said it would continue with initiatives to increase operational efficiency during 2024. Reuters

Range of Issues On E.V.s Stokes Partisan Battle: [National Desk]

Full text: The electric vehicle, a breakthrough achievement in automotive technology, has driven into this year's presidential election, inflaming partisan fights that have come to define much of American culture.
One reason is that President Biden has made electric vehicles central to his strategy to combat climate change. This week, his administration announced the most ambitious climate regulation in the nation's history: a measure designed to accelerate a transition toward electric vehicles and away from the gasoline-powered cars that are a major cause of global warming.
The political war over electric vehicles has been fueled by an incendiary mix of issues: technological change, the future of the oil and gas industry, concerns about competition from China and the American love of motorized muscle. And in the rural reaches of America, where few public charging stations exist, the notion of an all-electric future feels fanciful -- another element to the urban-rural divide that underlies the nation's polarization.
Mr. Biden's opponent, former President Donald J. Trump, has for months escalated attacks on electric vehicles broadly and the new regulation in particular, falsely calling the rule a ban on gasoline-powered cars and claiming electric cars will "kill" America's auto industry. He has called them an "assassination" of jobs. He has declared that the Biden administration "ordered a hit job on Michigan manufacturing" by encouraging the sales of electric cars.
Within minutes of this week's announcement of the new rule, similar talking points -- albeit not as violent -- flooded the Republican ecosystem.
"The Biden administration is deciding for Americans which kind of cars they are allowed to buy, rent and drive," said Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, the ranking Republican on the Senate Environment Committee, in remarks that were echoed across the Capitol and on Fox News. A Fox News headline falsely claimed "Biden mandates production of electric vehicles."
In many ways, Mr. Biden's new rules on auto pollution combine elements that conservatives love to hate: government regulations and the notion that Democrats want to force Americans to give up comforts in the name of the environment.
Over the years, Mr. Trump has sharpened Republican opposition to environmental rules by attacking everything from non-aerosol hair spray to low-flow toilets. He has bashed energy-efficient dishwashers, LED lightbulbs and falsely claimed that wind turbines cause cancer.
In pitching his E.V. policies to Americans, Mr. Biden has sought to present himself as a "car guy," talking about his upbringing as the son of a car dealer and test driving a Ford-150 electric pickup truck to pronounce "This sucker's quick!" He was the first president to join auto workers on the picket line.
Still, policy analysts say that Mr. Trump's attacks on the government's efforts to clean up cars are likely to resonate with voters.
"When you get into personal vehicles, you're touching a huge portion of the United States," said Barry Rabe, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. "The majority of Americans have little or no familiarity with E.V.s. When you get into the question of what you drive, how you drive, how reliable it is and what it signifies about your identity -- that's where the culture wars come in."
Especially potent is the false claim that the new rule is a "ban" on conventional cars, analysts said.
The E.P.A. regulation is not a ban. Rather, it requires carmakers to meet tough new average emissions limits across their entire product line, starting in model year 2027 and ramping up through 2032. Automakers could comply with the emissions caps by selling a mix of gasoline-burning cars, hybrids, E.V.s or other types of vehicles, such as cars powered by hydrogen.
The E.P.A. estimates that compliance with the rule would mean that by 2032, about 56 percent of new passenger vehicles sold would be electric and another 16 percent would be hybrids. Car companies that exceed the new restrictions could face substantial penalties. The new standards would not apply to the used car market.
Cars and other forms of transportation are, together, the largest single source of carbon emissions generated by the United States, pollution that is driving climate change and that helped to make 2023 the hottest year in recorded history.
The new limits on tailpipe emissions would avoid more than seven billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions over the next 30 years, according to the E.P.A. That's the equivalent of removing a year's worth of all the greenhouse gases generated by the United States, the country that has historically pumped the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
It would also provide nearly $ 100 billion in annual net benefits to society, according to the agency, including $ 13 billion annually in public health benefits like avoided hospitalizations and fewer premature deaths thanks to improved air quality.
And it would save the average American driver about $ 6,000 in reduced fuel and maintenance over the life of a vehicle, the E.P.A. estimated.
The country's major car companies have grudgingly accepted the new regulations, after winning some concessions from the administration, in the form of a more gradual compliance schedule that pushes back the most stringent requirements until after 2030.
"The future is electric," said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents 42 car companies that produce nearly all the new vehicles sold in the United States, in a statement this week. He said the rules "are mindful of the importance of choice to drivers and preserve their ability to choose the vehicle that's right for them."
But other industries that will be affected by the rule have launched attacks -- particularly oil and gas companies that see the rise of electric vehicles as an existential threat.
The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, a lobbying organization, has begun what it says is a "seven figure" campaign of advertising, phone calls and text messages against what it calls "Biden's E.P.A. car ban" in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona, as well as in Ohio, Montana and the Washington, D.C., market.
Also fighting the rule are more than 4,000 of the country's 18,000 car dealerships, which wrote to Mr. Biden urging him to "tap the brakes" on the rule. Auto dealers -- business owners rooted in communities who directly interact with motorists as they choose what to drive -- could be particularly persuasive to voters, analysts said.
"It's really surprising that it just got rammed down our throats," said Duane Wilkes, chief financial officer of the Berge Auto Group in Arizona, which owns six dealerships in Phoenix and Tucson that sell vehicles made by Toyota, Lexus, Ford, Volkswagen and Mazda.
"What we sell isn't determined by us, it's determined by the customer, what they really want to buy," Mr. Wilkes said. "And the E.V.s are just sitting on the lots."
In the Phoenix metro area, electric vehicles represented 11.6 percent of new car registrations last year. "It's trying to get votes," said Mr. Wilkes, who described himself as an independent voter. "It won't get mine. They want to enforce a change I don't think a typical American is ready for."
He added, "We have skin in the game and this is a direct shot to our profitability and maybe even our existence in some cases."
And yet, electric vehicles are the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry. Sales of electric vehicles, trucks and S.U.V.s hit a record last year, reaching 1.2 million for the first time, bringing the share of electric vehicles in the United States vehicle market to 8.5 percent of new auto registrations. While growth is slowing, this year is expected to set another record, analysts have said.
But the boom is not happening everywhere. In California, which leads the nation in terms of the number of charging stations, 40 percent of new cars registered in San Jose last year were electric. But in Detroit, the country's automobile capital, they accounted for only 3 percent and even less in Buffalo and Bismark, N.D.
Michael McKenna, a Republican strategist and energy lobbyist who worked in the Trump White House, said Republican polling has found attacking electric vehicle mandates to be an "amazing" issue for the party. He called Mr. Biden's regulation a "shadow ban" on gas-powered vehicles. "If you make something unavailable it's the same as banning it," he said.
"It's a solid second tier issue, with a special salience in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio for obvious reasons," Mr. McKenna said, referring to swing states that Mr. Biden is hoping to win. "Are people going to vote on it? Probably it's not going to be their main driver. But is it going to be a secondary confirmation thing? Yes."
Stefan Hankin, a Democratic strategist and founder of Lincoln Park Strategies, who has warned the party about "pushing voters too hard" on electric vehicles, said he believes the car rule will help Mr. Biden.
"It's not a ban, and that's encouraging," Mr. Hankin said, adding that the rule "sends a signal to environmentally-minded voters and younger voters, which the Biden campaign is definitely interested in."
A 2023 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found half of American adults, and 70 percent of Republicans and those who lean Republican, said they were not likely to consider purchasing an electric vehicle as their next car. In the same poll, 56 percent of Democrats and those who lean Democratic said they would consider buying an E.V.
Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican operative, saw the same partisan split in a November poll conducted by the EV Politics Project, an advocacy group he founded.
"It's a tribal issue," said Mr. Murphy, who has worked for Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and other moderate Republicans. Mr. Murphy, a fan of electric vehicles, founded the EV Politics Project to try to get Republicans to stop bashing them -- a lonely struggle.
"If you can't crack the Republican problem there is no way you can get to these targets," Mr. Murphy said, referring to the E.P.A.'s emission goals. "They are going to run out of Democrats."
Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, which accounts for half of electric vehicle sales in the United States, has aligned himself with many hard-right views, leading analysts to wonder whether he could change conservative attitudes about the cars. "He could soften up the Republican opposition if he chose to," Mr. Murphy said. But there is little evidence that is happening.
Republicans and Mr. Trump have argued electric vehicles help China, America's economic rival, because minerals critical to battery manufacturing like graphite and manganese often originate in China.
Mr. Trump's opposition to electric vehicles has created a dilemma for political leaders in several Republican-led states where new electric vehicle and battery plants are being built, thanks to federal incentives overseen by the Biden administration.
Henry McMaster, the Republican governor of South Carolina, was asked about that quandary during a ceremony in February to mark the construction of a $ 2 billion plant to manufacture electric pickups and off-road vehicles under the Scout brand. The factory is expected to create as many as 4,000 jobs.
Gov. McMaster insisted that Mr. Trump is not against electric vehicles.
"What President Trump is opposed to, as most people are, are mandates -- federal mandates," Gov. McMaster told reporters. "We do understand electric vehicles are a part of the future of South Carolina. We're following the market."
The political and social messages that consumers absorb about E.V.s could significantly shape the success of the new regulation, said Stephanie Brinley, an analyst for the Auto Intelligence service at S & P Global Mobility. That's because the rule depends so heavily on whether motorists buy the cleaner cars.
"That is part of the wild card about consumers," said Ms. Brinley. "It's an emotional thing. It's reflective of the either/or mentality that dominates social media. It could have an impact on how fast or how slow this transition goes."

The electric vehicle, a breakthrough achievement in automotive technology, has driven into this year’s presidential election, inflaming partisan fights that have come to define much of American culture.
One reason is that President Joe Biden has made electric vehicles central to his strategy to combat climate change. This week, his administration announced the most ambitious climate regulation in the nation’s history: a measure designed to accelerate a transition toward electric vehicles and away from the gasoline-powered cars that are a major cause of global warming.
The political war over electric vehicles has been fueled by an incendiary mix of issues: technological change, the future of the oil and gas industry, concerns about competition from China and the American love of motorized muscle. And in the rural reaches of America, where few public charging stations exist, the notion of an all-electric future feels fanciful — another element to the urban-rural divide that underlies the nation’s polarization.
Biden’s opponent, former President Donald Trump, has for months escalated attacks on electric vehicles broadly and the new regulation in particular, falsely calling the rule a ban on gasoline-powered cars and claiming electric cars will “kill” America’s auto industry. He has called them an “assassination” of jobs. He has declared that the Biden administration “ordered a hit job on Michigan manufacturing” by encouraging the sales of electric cars.
Within minutes of this week’s announcement of the new rule, similar talking points — albeit not as violent — flooded the Republican ecosystem.
“The Biden administration is deciding for Americans which kind of cars they are allowed to buy, rent and drive,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, the ranking Republican on the Senate Environment Committee, in remarks that were echoed across the Capitol and on Fox News. A Fox News headline falsely claimed “Biden mandates production of electric vehicles.”
In many ways, Biden’s new rules on auto pollution combine elements that conservatives love to hate: government regulations and the notion that Democrats want to force Americans to give up comforts in the name of the environment.
Over the years, Trump has sharpened Republican opposition to environmental rules by attacking everything from non-aerosol hair spray to low-flow toilets. He has bashed energy-efficient dishwashers and LED light bulbs, and falsely claimed that wind turbines cause cancer.

Re "New Rule Aims to Push E.V.s to Fore" (Business, March 21):
I am 100 percent for electric vehicles. I commend President Biden for making such a bold and forward-thinking proposal. But the reality is that this may never happen in today's America. As your story notes, fossil fuel companies and Republican attorneys general are likely to file legal challenges.
One thing that also needs to be addressed is the availability of the materials needed to make the batteries. We must realize how much damage is done to the environment in order to access these materials.
E.V.s will never become mainstream until some major infrastructure changes take place. These include the need for hundreds of thousands of charging stations across America, including fast-charging stations. Luckily, Mr. Biden's green initiatives and infrastructure plans are already in place so these are beginning to take shape.
E.V.s must also see a huge increase in battery capacity, thus allowing users to drive longer distances on a single charge.
And finally, the cost of these vehicles must become affordable for those who have been unable to buy them in the past.
On the upside, like all technology, this will happen organically. As time goes on, E.V.s will become more affordable.
Prediction: It will take another seven to 10 years before E.V.s become mainstream.

Re "A Hybrid-First Strategy Is Paying Off for Toyota" (Business, March 13):
Toyota's hybrid-first strategy may be delivering big profits right now, but Toyota stands to lose out to its competitors if the company refuses to make a significant transition to electric vehicles.
Where Toyota is getting it wrong is that the transition to electric vehicles is unavoidable. The transportation industry is the single largest U.S. source of greenhouse gas emissions, and hybrid vehicles still run on gas. E.V.s do not produce tailpipe emissions and are the best choice to eliminate carbon pollution.
Tracking short-term financial benefits -- stock prices, earnings and sales -- misses the point. While The Times notes that Toyota sold 15,000 E.V.s in the U.S. in 2023, I'm not impressed. Toyota is woefully behind the sales targets of competitor brands.
Toyota is at a precipice: The company can either continue to double down on gas-powered hybrids and risk becoming obsolete -- or it can meaningfully start producing all-electric vehicles. Should Toyota continue to refuse an E.V. transition, its focus on hybrids will prove to be shortsighted, coming at the expense of worsening the climate crisis and devaluing the brand.

Putin's Anti-Gay Persecution
To the Editor:
Re "Putin's War Against Queer Ukrainians," by J. Lester Feder (Opinion guest essay, March 17):
I am a gay man of a certain age. My heart ached and my gut wrenched when I read Mr. Feder's reports of Russian atrocities targeting L.G.B.T.Q. Ukrainians. As if Vladimir Putin's politicized use of homophobia weren't bad enough, wielding such hate as a weapon of war takes his depravity to whole new levels.
While I never experienced the targeted torture and persecution Ukrainian gays now experience, Mr. Feder's piece reminded me that there were times and places here in the U.S. that absolutely made being gay unsafe. Given the recent rise in hate crimes of various sorts, including increased violence against gay people -- not to mention potential rollbacks of gay rights by the radical right -- we are moving back to those unsafe times.
It is imperative that the international community thoroughly investigate and prosecute all Russian war crimes, including crimes against L.G.B.T.Q. Ukrainians. That will be the first positive step toward eradicating violent anti-gay ideology in Ukraine and here at home.

Church and State
To the Editor:
Re "G.O.P. Official in N. Carolina Sows Gospel of Far Right" (news article, March 19):
Mark Robinson, the Republican nominee for governor in North Carolina, claims he can't find the phrase "separation of church and state" in the "writings of any patriot, anywhere."
He apparently didn't look very far, because Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter to the Danbury Baptists in 1802 that the First Amendment's establishment clause created "a wall of separation between Church & State" designed to keep the government from influencing religions.

Death Preparations
To the Editor:
Re "I Asked My Mom if She Was Prepared to Die," by Shaina Feinberg and Julia Rothman (Sunday Business, March 17):
In addition to the excellent advice in this article, I suggest writing your own obituary. Not all of us are lucky enough to have one written by reporters for The New York Times, but we can follow their model of having the basics prepared.
It's shocking how many people don't know all of their husband/wife/significant other's relatives and friends; educational, professional or civic achievements; or even where they might want charitable donations sent.
Keep it with your other documents pertaining to your death -- including the photo you want to accompany it -- and you will relieve your loved ones of one more sad task as they mourn your passing.

To the Editor:
The article about end-of-life planning offered many helpful ideas but it did not mention one that has put me more at ease: donating my body to science.
I reached out to a local medical school (in this case, the University of California San Francisco) and signed up for its Willed Body Program.
Not only will I rest knowing that my body is helping to educate the next generation of physicians, but the program also pays for everything, including pickup and cremation, so I can be assured that my family won't spend our hard-earned money on inflated funeral expenses instead of on things that make them happy.

Falling Birthrates
To the Editor:
Re "Birthrates Are Plummeting Worldwide. Why?" ("The Ezra Klein Show," Opinion, nytimes.com, March 19):
That birthrates are plummeting around the world is testament to the fact that life is generally getting better. With rising incomes, there are more income-earning opportunities, particularly for women. In many countries the amount of education needed for a given job has increased. People are studying longer and working harder.
The cost of having a baby needs to be considered against the loss of income from a woman's wages, a trade-off that was not required when jobs for women were relatively few and far between. As a consequence women are often choosing not to have babies.
Further, women are getting married later and having babies later in life, so they will end up having fewer children compared with women who start having children much earlier in life.

In New York, Migrants Face Shorter Shelter Stays: [briefing]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The city has negotiated a deal that will limit single migrants to 30-day shelter stays. Officials hope it will ease the crunch without increasing street homelessness.
Good morning. It's Monday. Today we'll get details on how the city's so-called right-to-shelter requirement is being scaled back amid the continuing struggle to house thousands of migrants.
Most adult migrants without children will now have to leave shelters in New York City after 30 days unless they meet certain criteria to extend their stay.
That was the most significant change in a legal agreement modifying a longstanding requirement that the city provide shelter to anyone who asks for it. Migrant families with children will not be affected.
The settlement ended months of legal wrangling that began in May, when Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, sought permission to change the 42-year-old consent decree that established New York's right-to-shelter requirement, which is unique among cities in the U.S.
I asked Luis Ferré-Sadurní, who reports on immigration and the migrant crisis in New York, to explain the changes.
The shelters are overloaded. How will this settlement make a difference?
Officials say this settlement will give the city more flexibility to get migrant adults out of the shelter system. Right now, migrant adults without children make up about 22 percent of the 65,000 migrants in shelters.
It's important to note that the underlying right-to-shelter requirement that was established more than 40 years ago is still intact. This settlement does not change the fact that New York is the only city in the U.S. with a requirement to provide a bed to anyone who needs it.
The new rules in the settlement are meant to apply very narrowly to the migrant crisis. These rules don't apply to homeless people who are not recent migrants. The new rules are important to city officials who do not want the migrants in their care staying in the shelter system indefinitely.
So the changes in the settlement are mainly aimed at that 22 percent -- roughly 14,000 adult migrants. Will there be a rise in homeless people on the streets?
Not necessarily. For one thing, the settlement allows adult migrants to reapply for a bed in the system if they meet certain requirements. If they can show they are making significant efforts to get out of the system, but still haven't found a home, the city is required to give them a bed again.
That said, it remains to be seen how the city is going to accomplish this and meet its legal requirements. The city is required to consider extensions on a case-by-case basis. City officials have not said how they're going to handle all the requests they're bound to get from migrants who say they need to stay longer than 30 days.
What the city does will be watched closely. The city will put together weekly reports showing how many extensions have been granted and how many have been denied. The lawyers from the Legal Aid Society, who represent the plaintiffs in the case, have said very clearly that they'll be monitoring the city's actions and that they are ready to go back to court if they think the city is, for example, denying shelter to people who are actually eligible under the settlement.
What will happen to migrants who reach the 30-day limit and don't have an exception?
It remains to be seen.
If the city denies their request to stay longer than 30 days, they might not have access to a bed in the shelter system and might have to figure out some other living arrangements. That could mean that some are effectively left homeless. But Legal Aid lawyers note there's nothing in the agreement preventing a migrant from trying to apply for a bed again, even after his or her extension request has been turned down.
The 30-day rule is not new. Isn't the difference that the city can now say no to migrants who want to stay longer than that?
Right. Under the previous rules, adult migrants without children could stay in city shelters for 30 days and could then reapply for another bed, no questions asked.
There have been backlogs. Over the past few months, we've seen that adult migrants who reapplied for beds after 30 days have had to wait, sometimes more than a week, for the city to get them another bed. Many of them were effectively homeless while they were waiting. Some had to wait in the cold outside the processing center in the East Village where they go to reapply. Often they were made to sleep on the floor of what the city calls "waiting rooms," which are basically the lobbies of shelter buildings where they're trying to be assigned another bed.
The agreement says exceptions will be made only under "extenuating circumstances." What are they?
Adult migrants would be able to stay longer than 30 days if they can prove to the city that they're making "significant efforts" to get out of the shelter system and find housing but haven't yet. They could show that they've applied for a job or a job-training program or that they've been searching for an apartment.
They could also stay longer than 30 days if they show that they have plans to leave New York City soon but need a few more days in the shelter. Similarly, if they have an immigration hearing in the next 30 days or a lease for an apartment that starts in the next few weeks but need a place to stay in between, they could stay longer.
All of this is at the discretion of the city.
Does the city have the personnel to process requests for exceptions?
The city already has a heavily staffed infrastructure in place to handle the migrant shelter system across shelters, hotels and dormitories. It remains to be seen if officials will have to redirect some of those resources or hire more people to make sure they can process all this in a timely manner.
There are a lot of open questions here. The next few weeks will be very important to see how this plays out, to see how many people are being denied shelter and what happens to adult migrants who are unable to gain access to the shelter system anymore. Do they end up on the streets? Do they leave New York City? Those are things that advocates for immigrants and for the homeless will be watching for.
Expect a mostly sunny day in the low 50s. The evening will be mostly cloudy, with temperatures dropping to the mid-30s.
In effect until Sunday (Purim).

Gun Hill Road
Dear Diary:
My flight from Milan arrived at Kennedy Airport amid torrential downpours. I struggled into the mass of dripping humanity outside the arrivals area.
"I'm here," said the text from my daughter Karin. "You'll find me."
I saw her ancient Toyota at the curb, near a service truck whose driver was struggling to remove a flat tire from her car. The rusted bolts finally gave way with the help of a couple of cabbies and a sledgehammer.
Unfortunately, we soon found that the temporary spare was no good.
"Where do you have to go?" someone asked.
"New London," I said.
It was 10 o'clock on a Sunday night, and the consensus was that we were doomed.
"Think you can make it to the Bronx?" someone asked. "There's an all-night tire repair on Gun Hill Road."
"Yeah," a cabby said, "I know that place."
A quick search online turned up the number, and a sleepy voice answered: "Get here before I take my break at midnight."
Off we went to the Gun Hill Road exit off Route I-95, and then west to a dimly lit storefront with a jack on the sidewalk out front. A soul food restaurant was open next door.
"I'm starving," Karin said, making a beeline for the restaurant. I dashed after her and soon found her, with her purple hair, chatting with the cashier, a young woman with bright blue hair.
The food was great and the new tire was reasonably priced. Having once lived nearby on Decatur Avenue, I felt as if I had come home again.

New Clean Air Rules Will Still Propel Manufacturers to Sell More Electric Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: New Biden administration auto rules are less forceful than an earlier proposal but will still add to market pressure for cheaper electric vehicles.
Even if clean air rules announced on Wednesday in Washington are less forceful than some environmentalists would have liked, they should still have a powerful effect on the kinds of cars appearing in showrooms over the next several years, experts said.
The rules will amplify market forces pushing the industry toward battery power, giving automakers a strong incentive to sell a broader, more affordable variety of electric cars -- not just the expensive sport utility vehicles that have dominated sales so far.
"It probably means more models and lower prices," said Craig Segall, former deputy executive officer of the California Air Resources Board, an agency that played a key role in promoting electric vehicles in that state. "The way you win," he said, referring to carmakers, "is making sure you have an E.V. in each segment."
Despite talk of a slowdown, sales of electric vehicles are growing much faster than sales of vehicles that run on fossil fuels. Prices of electric vehicles have dropped significantly and are likely to fall further as carmakers get better at making them and the cost of batteries and raw materials plummets.
The Environmental Protection Agency rules announced Wednesday "certainly don't slow down the pace at which our members are scaling up production," said Albert Gore III, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association. The association's members include Tesla and other electric carmakers, as well as battery manufacturers, charging companies and suppliers.
The Inflation Reduction Act, passed by Democrats in 2022, led to a boom in investment in battery factories and electric vehicle plants. Since then, companies have announced investments of more than $ 110 billion in battery factories and electric vehicle assembly plants, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. These are long-term financial commitments that companies are likely to stick to regardless of what the federal government does.
Within a few years, electric cars that can drive more than 300 miles on a charge are likely to cost less than gasoline vehicles even before accounting for fuel savings. Electricity is usually much cheaper than gasoline. That will give more car buyers strong economic reasons to go electric.
The average price of a new electric vehicle has fallen substantially. It was $ 52,314 in February, according to Kelley Blue Book, still about $ 5,000 more than the average for all vehicles. But electric vehicle prices plummeted 13 percent in February from a year earlier, and more than $ 2,500 just from January. The cost of used battery-powered vehicles has dropped much more than that.
Prices will to continue to fall steeply because batteries, the most important and expensive component, are becoming much cheaper, analysts say. The average cost of a battery pack is on track to plunge more than 40 percent by 2030 compared with 2022, according to estimates by the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization.
Electric vehicles "are getting closer to parity with gas cars," said Katherine García, a transportation expert at the Sierra Club. "We are going to see that sooner than originally forecast."
During the early years of the E.P.A. rules announced on Wednesday, automakers will face somewhat less pressure to cut emissions than under an earlier agency proposal. The E.P.A. doesn't dictate to automakers how they meet the standards. They can also reduce emissions by improving the efficiency of gasoline engines or by selling more hybrid cars that augment gasoline engines with batteries and electric motors.
Plug-in hybrids, which can travel short distances on battery power alone and are growing in popularity, could proliferate during the next few years. They will account for as much as 9 percent of new car sales by 2030, according to E.P.A. estimates, compared with about 2 percent last year.
But automakers will get the most credit for all-electric cars that have no tailpipe emissions. They will account for 44 percent of new cars by 2030, according to the E.P.A.
Longer term, most automakers acknowledge that they need to sell appealing electric vehicles to survive.
"E.V.s are clearly the future and what consumers are going to be wanting and what's going to be cheapest to produce," said Stephanie Searle, chief program officer at the International Council on Clean Transportation. "Automakers need to be investing in that to keep up."
Tesla has already shaken the car market and has become the world's most valuable automaker. New competitors from China are looming, as Beijing tries to take advantage of the technological shift to become a major auto exporter.
Tariffs and other restrictions have limited Chinese exports to the United States so far. But automakers like BYD, which sells an electric car in China for less than $ 12,000, could find a way in by producing in Mexico or even building factories in the United States.
For automakers, the emergence of Chinese rivals is a powerful motivator. It evokes unpleasant memories of the way Toyota, Honda and other Japanese automakers broke the dominance of Ford Motor, General Motors and Chrysler in the 1970s with inexpensive, fuel-efficient cars. Tesla, Ford and Volkswagen are among the major automakers working on low-cost electric vehicles that are clearly inspired by the threat from China.
Experience has shown that technology often moves faster than regulations require. Under E.P.A. rules that took effect in 2017, electric vehicles were expected to account for 3 percent of new car sales by 2025. But battery-powered cars are already at about 8 percent of the U.S. new car market.
In California, which has long had the strictest pollution limits, electric cars made up 25 percent of new cars sold last year. And under rules passed in 2022, the state will phase out cars that burn fossil fuels by 2035.
"California has more than its share of E.V.s because we asked for it," said Mr. Segall, the former state official, who is now vice president of Evergreen, an activist group.
Another 12 states, including New York and New Jersey, model their rules on California's and won't be affected much by E.P.A. regulations because their rules are already stricter. The federal rules will have the most impact on states like Texas, Florida and Connecticut that don't follow California.
The rules will also put pressure on carmakers like Toyota and Stellantis, the owner of Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep, which have been slow to sell fully electric vehicles.
The E.P.A. rules are among numerous Biden administration policies intended to promote electric vehicles. Tax credits of up to $ 7,500 are available for vehicles that are manufactured in the United States, Canada or Mexico and meet other requirements designed to promote a domestic supply chain. The number of vehicles that qualify is small, but is expected to grow as carmakers like Hyundai make more vehicles in the United States.
The government is also subsidizing construction of fast-charging stations, which along with investments by carmakers like Mercedes-Benz and charging companies like Electrify America will soon remove a major sticking point for many car buyers.
Surveys show that many people are interested in electric cars but are worried about finding a place to charge on road trips. If governments and companies follow through on all the plans they have announced, according to a study published this month by the International Council on Clean Transportation, by 2030 there will be more than enough fast chargers.

Conquering a Whole Mountain of Views: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A professor's 30-year dream of assembling a complete set of "Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji," the pinnacle of the artist's career, leads to an auction.
Jitendra V. Singh was nearly 60, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, when he finally bought his first woodblock print by the revered Japanese printmaker Katsushika Hokusai, whose work from the Edo 19th century includes a masterly series, "Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji."
It was 2013, and Dr. Singh was enchanted by Hokusai's view of the sacred mountain in Japan, central to each image in the artist's series: sometimes dominant, sometimes in the background, but always present.
By then Dr. Singh had made three long trips into the Himalayas, gone high-altitude trekking on Mt. Everest, and journeyed to Mount Kailash in Tibet, which is sacred to Hindus.
"I have a thing about mountains," Dr. Singh, now 70 and retired, said during an interview in his apartment in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "To me Hokusai captured the essence of the mountain."
Fascination with Hokusai and his images has led Dr. Singh on a singular quest to assemble the entire "Thirty-Six Views" series (actually there are 46 images.) He completed that challenge in January 2023, and this week, he is selling the entire set at Christies. The estimate is $ 3 million to $ 5 million.
There are likely fewer than 10 complete collections that exist in the world. The series includes "Under the Well of the Great Wave Off Kanagawa," from 1831, with Mount Fuji rising behind soaring claw-like blue waves enveloping the boats thrusting through them. It has become an iconic image, reproduced on coffee cups, sneakers and even curtains around the world. But treasured sets are mostly held by prominent museums including the Metropolitan Museum, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the British Museum and the Bibliothèque Nationale of France. A complete set sold at Sotheby's for $ 1.47 million in 2002, though the buyer remains anonymous.
The series is considered the greatest work by the artist, who was born in 1760 and began working in woodblocks at a young age. He was an Ukiyo-e artist -- famous for prints that celebrated the daily lives of people in the countryside and cities, their travels and the country's serene landscapes in sumptuous colors and exquisite detail. (Ukiyo-e means "pictures of the floating world.") When his work, along with that of other Ukiyo-e artists of that period, was discovered by French artists, they were infatuated. The Japanese artists and Hokusai in particular had an extraordinary influence on the Impressionists because, as one admirer wrote at the time, the work revealed "an unsuspected page in the great book of world art." That influence became known as Japonisme.
Certainly Dr. Singh has been uncommonly focused on one aspect of one artist's work. Still, he never put "Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji" on display at his former home near San Francisco.
"I have no desire to show them in my home and gloat over them," he said. Instead he kept them hermetically sealed inside Japanese boxes. "They are far too delicate," he said.
It was not simply the beauty of the prints that appealed to Dr. Singh, but the subject matter. As a religious Hindu, his mountain trips were emotionally powerful "because climbing the mountains is a metaphor for our lives," he said. "We are all alone. If you strip away everything, life is a journey."
His high mountain road to the Hokusai prints included his first, sacred pilgrimage to Tibet during the summer of 2006, a seven-day overland journey in Toyota Land Cruisers from Lhasa to Mount Kailash, "mostly on dirt roads, all at altitudes above 15,000 feet," he said in an email, sending snapshots showing weeks of beard growth.
His circumambulation of Mount Kailash followed a ritual bath in melted glacier waters of Lake Manasarovar, a sacred lake in Hindu mythology, believed to be formed by Lord Brahma."Bathing in the lake is said to liberate the worshiper from all the sins of all lifetimes," he explained. "I thought I needed that bit of divine help."
DR. SINGH DID NOT SEE his first Hokusai until he was in his 40s and traveling the world. He had grown up in Lucknow, a large city in northern India, one of 11 children from three marriages. "My father was a high-level civil servant," he said. "Art was considered a frivolity in our house."
Dr. Singh recalled that his town "had a fine high school quality library and I read lots of literature," and he went on to get a full scholarship to Stanford Business School and a Ph.D. in his mid 20s. Flying home from Stanford via Tokyo to Delhi, he caught his first glimpse of Mount Fuji in the sunlight, he remembered. "It was the symbol of beauty and purity in its purest form."
In 1990, he visited Japan, where the mother of a student from back in the United States gave him a high-quality print by Kawase Hasui, one of 20th-century Japan's most celebrated printmakers, which included an image of a mountain. On his own, Dr. Singh settled for cheap reproductions of Hokusai's "Great Wave Off Kanagawa" and the image known as "Red Fuji," admiring the mountain's red tint. "The Hokusais were stunning," he remembered.
He hung the reproductions at his home in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Over the following years, Hokusai's work grew on him. "I found them very stylized and beautiful in detail and composition," he recalled, "whether it is the people, landscapes or the sea." But he could never imagine buying one until 2011, when he had made some money in investments and was again visiting Tokyo. He asked a friend where he might buy more Hokusai prints and was sent to the Jimbocho neighborhood, where art galleries sell fine prints from the Ukiyo-e period.
At Mita Arts Gallery, he met Ken Caplan, its owner and confided that if he could afford it, "I would possibly like to buy the whole set."
Thus began the final stage of his odyssey, which lasted more than 10 years. Caplan would send images of the prints as they became available. "It was very important to keep it secret," Dr. Singh recalled. Otherwise sellers, sniffing an eager buyer, would raise prices.
His first purchase, in 2013, was "Fuji Seen From Kanaya on the Tokaido." In 2014, 2015 and 2016, he bought three of the best known images in the series. All things being equal, he was told, the early impressions of any print are likely to be of better quality, although it is also the case that they may be damaged or faded. In all, he said, he spent about $ 3 million putting together the set.
As Dr. Singh came to know more about the artist, Hokusai's long career and commitment to his art also impressed the collector, especially his self-reflections. Hokusai once said that though he had been sketching from the age of 6, "nothing I did before the age of 70 was worthy of attention." If the statement was exaggerated, it was also prescient. The artist embarked on "Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji," considered the summit of his own creativity, in 1830, when he was 70.
That also resonated with Dr. Singh. "He dedicated his life to art," the collector mused. "It is a notion that we are born to perfect ourselves. That is a very Hindu notion."
By 2018, Dr. Singh had collected 41 prints. "The last five were the hardest to find," he remembered. " I got the last one in January of 2023." It was "Sazai Hall at the Temple of the Five Hundred Arhats" -- a reference to the legendary disciples of Buddha -- in which men and women in flowing robes stand on a temple balcony admiring Mount Fuji.
"I had reached my goal."
As moved as he was by the art, he believed the investment in Hokusai would be a good "financial diversifier," the professor said. Last year, after Christie's sold a print of "Great Wave Off Kanagawa" for $ 2.8 million, a record for the artist, Dr. Singh chose to put his set up for auction. (Christie's is not charging him a typical seller's commission.)
He has put his prints into a trust. When they are sold, the money will go into the trust. Dr. Singh can withdraw 6 percent of the value of the trust every year. The balance grows tax-free and will go to charity.
But whatever the outcome of the sale Tuesday, in the view of Andreas Marks, author of "Hokusai: Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji," and the curator for Japanese and Korean Art at the Minneapolis Institute of Art: "The achievement of putting it all together is extraordinary."

Full text: The United Automobile Workers said a "supermajority" of the 4,000 eligible workers at a Volkswagen factory had signed cards backing the union.
Volkswagen employees in Tennessee who are hoping to join the United Automobile Workers asked a federal agency on Monday to hold an election, a key step toward the union's longtime goal of organizing nonunion factories across the South.
The union said Volkswagen workers had filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board asking for a unionization vote after a "supermajority" of the 4,000 eligible workers at the plant had signed cards supporting the U.A.W.
It did not specify how many workers had signed cards, but it previously advised workers to get the support of more than 70 percent of hourly workers and establish a robust organizing committee before seeking an election. A simple majority vote is needed to win representation.
"Today, we are one step closer to making a good job at Volkswagen into a great career," Isaac Meadows, an assembly worker at the plant, said in a statement issued by the union.
An election at the factory would be the first test of the U.A.W.'s strength after the union staged a wave of strikes in the fall against the three Detroit automakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis -- and winning record wage increases -- with encouragement from the Biden administration.
In a statement on Monday, Volkswagen said it would "fully support" an election giving every employee a chance to vote on union representation. "We respect our workers' right to a democratic process and to determine who should represent their interests," the company said.
Later Monday, President Biden issued a statement congratulating the Volkswagen workers for filing for the union election.
The U.A.W. has been hoping to use momentum from its bargaining with the Detroit-based manufacturers to organize nonunion plants in Southern states that pay significantly lower wages than union factories. The U.A.W. says it plans to spend $ 40 million over the next three years on its campaign.
Chattanooga workers have voted on U.A.W. representation twice before, and slim majorities rejected unionization each time. In a 2014 vote, the union had no opposition from Volkswagen management, but there was vocal resistance from state Republican leaders, who suggested that unionizing would jeopardize expansion and job growth at the plant. A second narrow loss came in 2019.
Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the U.A.W. was in a strong position to gain a majority this time.
"Now they have a lot more support from legislators, the public and the president," he said. "They can say, 'We can help you get better wages and benefits, and we proved we could do that with the Big Three."'
Over the last 40 years, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai and other foreign-owned automakers have built more than two dozen auto plants across the South and the lower Midwest, drawn by right-to-work laws that make it harder for unions to organize workers.
They also often chose to build factories in rural areas where prevailing wages are significantly lower than in Michigan and other Northern states.
In addition to the Volkswagen effort, union campaigns are underway at a Mercedes-Benz plant and a Hyundai factory, both in Alabama. The union says more than half of the Mercedes workers and more than 30 percent of the Hyundai workers have signed cards supporting U.A.W. membership.
Volkswagen workers said they wanted to join the U.A.W. to push for higher wages, more time off and improved safety measures. The Chattanooga factory opened in 2011 and makes the Atlas full-size sport utility vehicle and the ID.4 electric vehicle. It is the world's only Volkswagen plant without union representation.
"VW has partnered with unionized work forces around the world to make their plants safe and successful," Victor Vaughn, a logistics worker, said in the union statement. "That's why we're voting for a voice at Volkswagen here in Chattanooga."
The U.A.W. is likely to have support in the election from the powerful German labor union, IG Metall. Under German law, worker representatives occupy half of the seats on Volkswagen's supervisory board, the equivalent of an American board of directors.
The U.A.W. has sought for years to organize these nonunion auto plants without success, but unions have had a resurgence in recent years in organizing efforts and contract showdowns.
G.M., Ford and Stellantis agreed in the fall to roughly 25 percent wage increases for workers making the top U.A.W. wage, and even larger raises for workers farther down on the pay scale.
Within a few years, almost all of the 146,000 U.A.W. workers at the Detroit companies will earn more than $ 40 an hour -- the equivalent of about $ 83,000 a year for those working 40 hours a week.
The Volkswagen plant announced an 11 percent pay increase shortly after the strikes at the Big Three, bringing the top hourly wage for production workers to $ 32.40.
Nonunion auto plants generally start new workers at less than $ 20 an hour and pay a top wage under $ 30 an hour.

One Collector’s High Mountain Road to Hokusai

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Jitendra V. Singh was nearly 60, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, when he finally bought his first woodblock print by revered Japanese printmaker Katsushika Hokusai, whose work from the Edo 19th century includes a masterly series, “Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji.”
It was 2013, and Singh was enchanted by Hokusai’s view of the sacred mountain in Japan, central to each image in the artist’s series: sometimes dominant, sometimes in the background, but always present.
By then Singh had made three long trips into the Himalayas, gone high-altitude trekking on Mount Everest, and journeyed to Mount Kailash in Tibet, which is sacred to Hindus.
“I have a thing about mountains,” Singh, now 70 and retired, said during an interview in his apartment in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. “To me Hokusai captured the essence of the mountain.”
Fascination with Hokusai and his images has led Singh on a singular quest to assemble the entire “Thirty-Six Views” series (actually there are 46 images.) He completed that challenge in January 2023, and this week, he is selling the entire set at Christie’s. The estimate is $3 million to $5 million.
There are likely fewer than 10 complete collections that exist in the world. The series includes “Under the Well of the Great Wave Off Kanagawa,” from 1831, with Mount Fuji rising behind soaring claw-like blue waves enveloping the boats thrusting through them. It has become an iconic image, reproduced on coffee cups, sneakers and even curtains around the world. But treasured sets are mostly held by prominent museums including the Metropolitan Museum, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the British Museum and the Bibliothèque Nationale of France. A complete set sold at Sotheby’s for $1.47 million in 2002, though the buyer remains anonymous.
The series is considered the greatest work by the artist, who was born in 1760 and began working in woodblocks at a young age. He was an Ukiyo-e artist — famous for prints that celebrated the daily lives of people in the countryside and cities, their travels and the country’s serene landscapes in sumptuous colors and exquisite detail. (Ukiyo-e means “pictures of the floating world.”) When his work, along with that of other Ukiyo-e artists of that period, was discovered by French artists, they were infatuated. The Japanese artists and Hokusai in particular had an extraordinary influence on the impressionists because, as one admirer wrote at the time, the work revealed “an unsuspected page in the great book of world art.” That influence became known as Japonisme.
Certainly Singh has been uncommonly focused on one aspect of one artist’s work. Still, he never put “Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji” on display at his former home near San Francisco.
“I have no desire to show them in my home and gloat over them,” he said. Instead he kept them hermetically sealed inside Japanese boxes. “They are far too delicate,” he said.
It was not simply the beauty of the prints that appealed to Singh, but the subject matter. As a religious Hindu, his mountain trips were emotionally powerful “because climbing the mountains is a metaphor for our lives,” he said. “We are all alone. If you strip away everything, life is a journey.”
His high mountain road to the Hokusai prints included his first, sacred pilgrimage to Tibet during the summer of 2006, a seven-day overland journey in Toyota Land Cruisers from Lhasa to Mount Kailash, “mostly on dirt roads, all at altitudes above 15,000 feet,” he said in an email, sending snapshots showing weeks of beard growth.
His circumambulation of Mount Kailash followed a ritual bath in melted glacier waters of Lake Manasarovar, a sacred lake in Hindu mythology, believed to be formed by Lord Brahma. “Bathing in the lake is said to liberate the worshipper from all the sins of all lifetimes,” he explained. “I thought I needed that bit of divine help.”
Singh did not see his first Hokusai until he was in his 40s and traveling the world. He had grown up in Lucknow, a large city in northern India, one of 11 children from three marriages. “My father was a high-level civil servant,” he said. “Art was considered a frivolity in our house.”
Singh recalled that his town “had a fine high school quality library and I read lots of literature,” and he went on to get a full scholarship to Stanford Business School and a doctorate in his mid 20s. Flying home from Stanford via Tokyo to Delhi, he caught his first glimpse of Mount Fuji in the sunlight, he remembered. “It was the symbol of beauty and purity in its purest form.”
In 1990, he visited Japan, where the mother of a student from back in the United States gave him a high-quality print by Kawase Hasui, one of 20th-century Japan’s most celebrated printmakers, which included an image of a mountain. On his own, Singh settled for cheap reproductions of Hokusai’s “Great Wave Off Kanagawa” and the image known as “Red Fuji,” admiring the mountain’s red tint. “The Hokusais were stunning,” he remembered.
He hung the reproductions at his home in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Over the following years, Hokusai’s work grew on him. “I found them very stylized and beautiful in detail and composition,’’ he recalled, “whether it is the people, landscapes or the sea.” But he could never imagine buying one until 2011, when he had made some money in investments and was again visiting Tokyo. He asked a friend where he might buy more Hokusai prints and was sent to the Jimbocho neighborhood, where art galleries sell fine prints from the Ukiyo-e period.
At Mita Arts Gallery, he met Ken Caplan, its owner and confided that if he could afford it, “I would possibly like to buy the whole set.”
Thus began the final stage of his odyssey, which lasted more than 10 years. Caplan would send images of the prints as they became available. “It was very important to keep it secret,’’ Singh recalled. Otherwise sellers, sniffing an eager buyer, would raise prices.
His first purchase, in 2013, was “Fuji Seen From Kanaya on the Tokaido.” In 2014, 2015 and 2016, he bought three of the best known images in the series. All things being equal, he was told, the early impressions of any print are likely to be of better quality, although it is also the case that they may be damaged or faded. In all, he said, he spent about $3 million putting together the set.
As Singh came to know more about the artist, Hokusai’s long career and commitment to his art also impressed the collector, especially his self-reflections. Hokusai once said that though he had been sketching from the age of 6, “nothing I did before the age of 70 was worthy of attention.’’ If the statement was exaggerated, it was also prescient. The artist embarked on “Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji,” considered the summit of his own creativity, in 1830, when he was 70.
That also resonated with Singh. “He dedicated his life to art,” the collector said. “It is a notion that we are born to perfect ourselves. That is a very Hindu notion.”
By 2018, Singh had collected 41 prints. “The last five were the hardest to find,’’ he remembered. “I got the last one in January of 2023.” It was “Sazai Hall at the Temple of the Five Hundred Arhats” — a reference to the legendary disciples of Buddha — in which men and women in flowing robes stand on a temple balcony admiring Mount Fuji.
“I had reached my goal.”
As moved as he was by the art, he believed the investment in Hokusai would be a good ‘‘financial diversifier,’’ the professor said. Last year, after Christie’s sold a print of “Great Wave Off Kanagawa” for $2.8 million, a record for the artist, Singh chose to put his set up for auction. (Christie’s is not charging him a typical seller’s commission.)
He has put his prints into a trust. When they are sold, the money will go into the trust. Singh can withdraw 6% of the value of the trust every year. The balance grows tax-free and will go to charity.
But whatever the outcome of the sale Tuesday, in the view of Andreas Marks, author of “Hokusai: Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji,” and the curator for Japanese and Korean Art at the Minneapolis Institute of Art: “The achievement of putting it all together is extraordinary.”

Full text: A Fire Island tradition, a late-night flat-tire fix in the Bronx and more reader tales of New York City in this week's Metropolitan Diary.
Sand Sculptures
Dear Diary:
I used to see an older man and his wife every summer by the lighthouse on Fire Island: him, shirtless and wearing Bermuda shorts, her in a floppy pink straw hat.
The man would create two or three sand sculptures of classically styled, voluptuous women, with seaweed for hair and seashells for fingernails. Hundreds of people a day would walk by and admire his work.
The couple had been coming to the beach since the 1960s. We would say a few words, talking more and more as the years went on.
They were both around 80. They would arrive in the morning and leave by 2 p.m. The late afternoon waves would erase the man's creations, and he would be back the next week with new ones.
Summer would fade, and it would be eight or nine months before we returned. When we did, there he would be, creating his art.
We had grown up in Brooklyn, decades apart. We talked of our lives, our health, the pain and regret of advancing age. I told them of our son, who had died in a car accident. They were silent and crestfallen.
On my last day there one summer, they collected their belongings, the man's wife gave a little wave and he shrugged. They walked away, hand in hand.
The next summer, there was no sign of them. What had become of them was a mystery. People passed back and forth where he used to sit, as the ocean washed in and out.
-- Joseph P. Griffith
Gun Hill Road
Dear Diary:
My flight from Milan arrived at Kennedy Airport amid torrential downpours. I struggled into the mass of dripping humanity outside the arrivals area.
"I'm here," said the text from my daughter Karin. "You'll find me."
I saw her ancient Toyota at the curb, near a service truck whose driver was struggling to remove a flat tire from her car. The rusted bolts finally gave way with the help of a couple of cabbies and a sledgehammer.
Unfortunately, we soon found that the temporary spare was no good.
"Where do you have to go?" someone asked.
"New London," I said.
It was 10 o'clock on a Sunday night, and the consensus was that we were doomed.
"Think you can make it to the Bronx?" someone asked. "There's an all-night tire repair on Gun Hill Road."
"Yeah," a cabby said, "I know that place."
A quick search online turned up the number, and a sleepy voice answered: "Get here before I take my break at midnight."
Off we went to the Gun Hill Road exit off Route I-95, and then west to a dimly lit storefront with a jack on the sidewalk out front. A soul food restaurant was open next door.
"I'm starving," Karin said, making a beeline for the restaurant. I dashed after her and soon found her, with her purple hair, chatting with the cashier, a young woman with bright blue hair.
The food was great and the new tire was reasonably priced. Having once lived nearby on Decatur Avenue, I felt as if I had come home again.

Lorimer Street
Dear Diary:
I was living in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn in the early 2000s and had never ridden the L train past my stop, Lorimer Street.
One night, though, I was out late with co-workers in Manhattan and had a bit too much to drink. To get home, I got the L at Eighth Avenue, sitting down as the train idled awaiting its departure.
About an hour later I was awakened by the train conductor at the last stop, Canarsie-Rockaway Parkway. He asked what my intended stop was. When I said Lorimer, he asked me to get up and follow him.
I walked with him to the front of the train, where he told me to take a seat across from his booth. He left the door open and for the next hour we talked about life, work and sports while the train made its way back toward Manhattan.
When we got to Lorimer, I got off, fumbled my way home and into my apartment and went straight to sleep.
It was only the next morning that I realized that the conductor's conversation with me was intended to keep me awake so I wouldn't miss my stop a second time.
Thank you, Mr. M.T.A. conductor.
-- Artur Spiguel
Fruit Stand
Dear Diary:
I was walking toward Grand Central on a hot August day when I passed a fruit stand.
A harried-looking man in a suit was trying to buy a single apple from the vendor who, in turn, was trying to persuade the man to buy more.
"How about this beautiful ripe banana too?"
The man in the suit declined.
The vendor was emphatic.
"But sir," he said, "you need your potassium!"

Full text: Toyota, the world's largest automaker, has been criticized for selling few electric vehicles, but its decision to focus on hybrids is paying off financially.
In today's high-tech, high-stakes auto industry, fortunes can change quickly, and there's no better example of that right now than Toyota Motor.
Not long ago, it looked as if Toyota had fallen dangerously behind in electric vehicles. Tesla, the electric car pioneer, has grown rapidly and become the world's most valuable automaker. Seeing Tesla's success, other companies, such as General Motors and Ford Motor, concluded that large numbers of consumers were poised to switch to battery-powered cars and trucks and began investing tens of billions of dollars to catch up.
Toyota, however, was more deliberate -- or lethargic, its critics would say. It has introduced just two fully electric models in the United States so far, betting that its gas-electric hybrids and plug-in hybrid vehicles, which it has become known for, would remain popular and were sufficient to address climate change for now.
Amid all the enthusiasm for electric vehicles in the last few years, it seemed Toyota just didn't get it.
"I was shocked when I first heard about Toyota's strategy because I could see what Tesla was doing," said Earl Stewart, a Toyota dealer in Lake Park, Fla., who also enjoys driving his Tesla Model S.
But in the last six months, sales of electric vehicles have slowed, and American car buyers looking to cut their fuel bill and tailpipe emissions have been flocking to hybrids. Now Toyota's sales are booming, and the company is reporting huge profits.
"It's not the first time Toyota has proved me wrong, and it won't be the last, either," Mr. Stewart said.
Toyota's sudden strength is a reminder of how profoundly the auto industry is changing. Developing technologies like electric vehicles, advanced microchips and software are turning what was once a steady, slow-moving sector into a dynamic industry in which even fast-moving and well-run manufacturers can be knocked off course.
Toyota, a Japanese company, is the world's largest automaker; it sold more than 11 million vehicles in 2023, more than six times as many as Tesla. The company climbed the ranks of the industry slowly over a half century, first exporting small cars to the United States, then building factories across the South and Midwest, adding a luxury brand and expanding into the segments dominated by its Michigan-based rivals, like full-size pickup trucks.
A few times along the way, Toyota has bucked the industry's conventional wisdom. The introduction of its upscale Lexus brand, in 1989, seemed like a risky bet until it zoomed ahead of BMW and Mercedes-Benz in sales. Twenty-one years ago, Toyota introduced the Prius, a small car with a compact gasoline engine and an electric motor powered by a battery.
The combination allows the Prius to go 50 or more miles on a gallon of gas, and a plug-in hybrid model can make short trips without using any gasoline. Other automakers dismissed the car as a curiosity, but the Prius was a hit, and before long G.M., Ford and others developed their own hybrids.
Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, scorns hybrids, saying it makes no sense to have two propulsion systems under the hood. Consumers don't seem to care. Toyota offers more than two dozen hybrid or plug-in hybrid models, and they make up almost 30 percent of its sales, much higher than at most other automakers. Last year in the U.S. market, Toyota sold 2.2 million vehicles -- more than every automaker except G.M.
In January and February, Toyota's U.S. sales rose 20 percent, powered by an 83 percent rise in sales of its hybrids and plug-in models.
"We're not saying E.V.s are not a good solution to carbon emissions," said Jack Hollis, executive vice president of Toyota's North American arm. "They are. They're just not the only solution, and a lot of our customers have been telling us they want choice -- hybrids, plug-ins, and E.V.s."
The strategy is paying off. In the nine-month period starting last April, Toyota made $ 27 billion in profit, roughly double its earnings from the same period a year earlier. By comparison, Tesla's $ 15 billion profit in 2023 was about 19 percent higher than its 2022 figure.
Investors have taken notice. The stock market now values Tesla at less than half its peak market capitalization of $ 1.2 trillion in November 2021 in large part because its sales are growing more slowly and the profit it makes on each car has been falling. Over the same period, Toyota's valuation has risen by roughly a third, to about $ 400 billion.
Mike Ramsey, an analyst at the research firm Gartner, said Toyota's hybrid strategy is strong and based on long-term logic, but shifts in technology or the market could undermine the company's future performance and standing.
"Toyota seems to swing between dullard and genius, depending on the current state of thinking about technology," he said. "But no matter what, they still seem to sell more cars and trucks than anyone else."
One big market where Toyota is struggling is China, the world's largest car market. A lot of Chinese car buyers are opting for electric vehicles, helping domestic automakers like BYD gain market share from Toyota, Volkswagen and other foreign manufacturers.
Toyota has other problems, too. The company's Daihatsu subsidiary, which makes small cars, temporarily stopped all production in Japan in December after revealing that it had cheated on safety tests.
For now, however, Toyota's deliberate pace seems to be working overall and several other large automakers have moved closer to the company's path.
Mercedes-Benz, which had been hoping to phase out internal combustion models by 2030, said last month that it had pushed that goal back by at least five years. Ford has lowered production targets for electric vehicles and is slowing construction on plants that are supposed to produce batteries for electric vehicles.
G.M., which had stopped selling hybrids in the United States to focus on electric vehicles, has delayed the introduction of a few battery-powered models. It is also now planning to reintroduce hybrid and plug-in hybrid models, which dealers had pushed for.
"Deploying plug-in technology in strategic segments will deliver some of the environmental benefits of E.V.s as the nation continues to build its charging infrastructure," G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in February.
Electric vehicles have so far failed to win over many car buyers because they are generally more expensive than combustion or hybrid models even after taking into account government incentives. The challenges of charging electric vehicles, worries about range and their performance in cold weather have also caused some people to hesitate.
Hybrids don't face many of those issues. Some hybrids cost only a few hundred dollars more than similar gasoline cars -- a premium that owners can quickly recoup in fuel savings. In addition, regular hybrids never have to be plugged in.
Plug-in hybrid models, some of which can travel on just electricity for more than 40 miles and have a gasoline engine for longer trips, have much smaller batteries than electric vehicles and can be recharged relatively quickly. But these vehicles, which make up a small part of the market, may not be as beneficial financially or environmentally when driven long distances on just gasoline.
Toyota has plans to significantly increase hybrid production and sales. A hybrid version of its Tacoma pickup is rolling out. A redesigned Camry sedan, due this spring, will be available only as a hybrid.
The company will offer a range of electric vehicles, too, said Mr. Hollis, the Toyota executive. About 30 models will arrive by 2026, when Toyota hopes its U.S. electric vehicle sales will have risen to about 1.5 million vehicles a year. Last year it sold about 15,000.
In Florida, new Toyotas that arrive at Mr. Stewart's dealership in South Florida barely hit the lot before they are sold. At the beginning of March, he had only about 150 vehicles in inventory, down from the 500 he used to carry before the pandemic.
That hasn't deterred customers who have become accustomed to waiting months after ordering vehicles. At one point last year, he had 1,300 vehicles on order, and customers for all of them.
"I've been selling Toyotas since 1975, and business is better than ever," he said. "People are lining up to buy from me."

These Rodents Sure Are Rowdy: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The makers of "Hundreds of Beavers," a mostly wordless indie comedy, have been touring the country and holding energetic screenings, complete with appearances by the star species.
Last week, a bonkers low-budget movie that was shot in black and white and has no Hollywood stars, packed a 200-seat theater on a one-night engagement at the IFC Center in Manhattan. Additional screenings were added.
Mike Cheslik, the film's director, and Ryland Brickson Cole Tews, its leading man, don't have Hollywood connections or sacks of cash. What the two 33-year-old friends do have that helped their film make a splash with its New York debut is a secret weapon that would make a shrewd old-school movie pitchman like William Castle tingle with envy.
We're talking beavers. Big ones.
Two life-size beavers, actually -- plus a horse, all played by humans -- who took selfies with passers-by on the sidewalk and high-fived audience members in their seats before a screening of Cheslik's frolicsome farce "Hundreds of Beavers."
At a time when Hollywood and scrappy filmmakers alike are stressing over how to get butts into seats, Cheslik and Tews are counting on a live make-believe beaver fight -- a marketing gimmick dressed like a vaudeville act -- to sell their movie.
Their gamble is paying off. A recent multicity tour of 14 theaters in Great Lakes states was almost entirely sold out, thanks in part to the movie's robust, beaver-heavy social media presence.
"The thing about the Midwest is that these are people that like to go out in droves when they hear that the circus is in town, and that's what we brought to them," Tews said in a recent video interview where he was joined by Cheslik.
The film's other special something is Tews, who stars as a hunky fur trapper named Jean Kayak who wins over a woman by selling beaver pelts to her overprotective father. Local beavers -- and there are indeed hundreds of them -- put up a fight.
After the film ended at the IFC Center, Tews -- in a cute yellow crop top and oversized raccoon hat -- hopped onto a platform in front of the screen, slung one of the costumed beavers over his shoulders and spun around like a W.W.E. superstar as the Gen Z-leaning crowd cheered.
Nearly dialogue-free, "Hundreds of Beavers" is a madcap genre-hopper, mixing silent film performance styles with hand-drawn animation, slapstick comedy, Looney Tunes-like sound effects and stop-motion graphics. Like a Super Mario Brothers video game, its action unfolds in vignettes, with Jean outwitting whimsically disproportionate beavers and responding to fatal interactions with unlimited resurrections.
"Hundreds of Beavers" might sound like what two Wisconsin 13-year-olds would make if they raided grandpa's closet and mom's crafting basket. But behind the phantasmagorical comedy lies a cineaste's discernment.
Adam D. Jameson, who teaches writing at the University of Illinois at Chicago, was one of the more than 600 people who saw the film at Chicago's Music Box Theater. He called it "one of the most raucous screenings" he's ever attended.
"They're selling it with this rowdy Midwestern ironic element," he said, but it's "actually a very sophisticated film."
Cheslik, who studied filmmaking and television production at N.Y.U., said that as a kid he fell in love with silent-era comedy masters like Buster Keaton, and with Abbott and Costello comedies that he watched with his Minnesotan grandfather. Cheslik said the look of "Hundreds of Beavers" was inspired partly by Ernst Lubitsch's 1921 silent comedy "The Wildcat," with Pola Negri.
Tews said he looked to Jackie Chan as inspiration for his almost nonstop onscreen assortment of tumbles, leaps and somersaults. The 1925 silent film "Seven Chances," in which Keaton is pursued by hordes of angry women, gets a nod in "Hundreds of Beavers" when Jean is chased by, well, you guessed it.
Tews also called on his athletic prowess, honed from playing football from a young age.
"You get that physicality and you learn how to fall and take a hit and tackle and get up," he said.
Cheslik and Tews met at Whitefish Bay High School in Wisconsin, and since then have collaborated on several projects, including the 2018 horror-comedy "Lake Michigan Monster," which was directed by Tews. Both men said Midwestern comedy sensibilities course through "Hundreds of Beavers."
"It's a very blue-collar kind of humor," said Tews. "Everyone can relate to people falling down and getting hurt. Everyone thinks that's funny. Everyone thinks mascots are funny. It's not low brow humor. It's more simple."
Most of "Hundreds of Beavers" was filmed outdoors during the winter in ice-cold Wisconsin, in rural towns like Pembine and Superior. Even green screen content was shot outside, on a green tarp "against someone's minivan," said Cheslik.
The film may be Wisconsin in its sensibilities, but Cheslik said its themes were much broader.
"We tried to pick something that's universal -- man versus cold, man wants food, man wants love -- that will function no matter where you are," he said.
Kurt Ravenwood, one of the film's producers, said he had a tough time persuading a distributor to give the movie a theatrical run, but independent theaters were quick to agree to show it. It's one reason producers decided to spend money -- he wouldn't say how much -- to tour the film, driving a 1988 Toyota LiteAce van.
Ravenwood said that it cost about $ 150,000 to make the film, and to date it has netted about $ 60,000: enough to hire a press person and a theater booker, and to buy social media ads.
"Hundreds of Beavers" will be back at the IFC Center for a one-week run, beginning March 8; will roll out in additional markets in the coming weeks; and is set to be released on demand in early April. Matt DeTurck, the artistic director of the Little Theater in Rochester, N.Y., where the film sold out all 278 seats last month, said he would program it again since it's best seen big.
"I can't think of another film that's had this exact energy and chaos," he said.
Daniel Marra, 29, an audience member at the IFC Center, thought so too. Standing in the lobby after the film ended, Marra said watching "Hundreds of Beavers" felt like an antidote to "bloated, huge-budget movies."
"It shows you don't need all that money to make something great," he said. "It felt like a movie where there's a lot of love."

At a time when Hollywood and scrappy filmmakers alike are stressing over how to get butts into seats, Cheslik and Tews are counting on a live make-believe beaver fight — a marketing gimmick dressed like a vaudeville act — to sell their movie.
Their gamble is paying off. A recent multicity tour of 14 theaters in Great Lakes states was almost entirely sold out, thanks in part to the movie’s robust, beaver-heavy social media presence.
“The thing about the Midwest is that these are people that like to go out in droves when they hear that the circus is in town, and that’s what we brought to them,” Tews said in a recent video interview where he was joined by Cheslik.
The film’s other special something is Tews, who stars as a hunky fur trapper named Jean Kayak who wins over a woman by selling beaver pelts to her overprotective father. Local beavers — and there are indeed hundreds of them — put up a fight.
After the film ended at the IFC Center, Tews — in a cute yellow crop top and oversized raccoon hat — hopped onto a platform in front of the screen, slung one of the costumed beavers over his shoulders and spun around like a WWE superstar as the Gen Z-leaning crowd cheered.
Nearly dialogue-free, “Hundreds of Beavers” is a madcap genre-hopper, mixing silent film performance styles with hand-drawn animation, slapstick comedy, Looney Tunes-like sound effects and stop-motion graphics. Like a Super Mario Brothers video game, its action unfolds in vignettes, with Jean outwitting whimsically disproportionate beavers and responding to fatal interactions with unlimited resurrections.
“Hundreds of Beavers” might sound like what two Wisconsin 13-year-olds would make if they raided grandpa’s closet and mom’s crafting basket. But behind the phantasmagorical comedy lies a cineaste’s discernment.
Adam D. Jameson, who teaches writing at the University of Illinois at Chicago, was one of the more than 600 people who saw the film at Chicago’s Music Box Theater. He called it “one of the most raucous screenings” he’s ever attended.
“They’re selling it with this rowdy Midwestern ironic element,” he said, but it’s “actually a very sophisticated film.”
Cheslik, who studied filmmaking and television production at NYU, said that as a kid he fell in love with silent-era comedy masters like Buster Keaton, and with Abbott and Costello comedies that he watched with his Minnesotan grandfather. Cheslik said the look of “Hundreds of Beavers” was inspired partly by Ernst Lubitsch’s 1921 silent comedy “The Wildcat,” with Pola Negri.
Tews said he looked to Jackie Chan as inspiration for his almost nonstop on-screen assortment of tumbles, leaps and somersaults. The 1925 silent film “Seven Chances,” in which Keaton is pursued by hordes of angry women, gets a nod in “Hundreds of Beavers” when Jean is chased by, well, you guessed it.
Tews also called on his athletic prowess, honed from playing football from a young age.
“You get that physicality and you learn how to fall and take a hit and tackle and get up,” he said.
Cheslik and Tews met at Whitefish Bay High School in Wisconsin, and since then have collaborated on several projects, including the 2018 horror-comedy “Lake Michigan Monster,” which was directed by Tews. Both men said Midwestern comedy sensibilities course through “Hundreds of Beavers.”
“It’s a very blue-collar kind of humor,” said Tews. “Everyone can relate to people falling down and getting hurt. Everyone thinks that’s funny. Everyone thinks mascots are funny. It’s not lowbrow humor. It’s more simple.”
Most of “Hundreds of Beavers” was filmed outdoors during the winter in ice-cold Wisconsin, in rural towns such as Pembine and Superior. Even green screen content was shot outside, on a green tarp “against someone’s minivan,” Cheslik said.
The film may be Wisconsin in its sensibilities, but Cheslik said its themes were much broader.
“We tried to pick something that’s universal — man versus cold, man wants food, man wants love — that will function no matter where you are,” he said.
Kurt Ravenwood, one of the film’s producers, said he had a tough time persuading a distributor to give the movie a theatrical run, but independent theaters were quick to agree to show it. It’s one reason producers decided to spend money — he wouldn’t say how much — to tour the film, driving a 1988 Toyota LiteAce van.
Ravenwood said that it cost about $150,000 to make the film, and to date it has netted about $60,000: enough to hire a press person and a theater booker, and to buy social media ads.
“Hundreds of Beavers” will be back at the IFC Center for a one-week run, beginning Friday; will roll out in additional markets in the coming weeks; and is set to be released on demand in early April. Matt DeTurck, the artistic director of the Little Theater in Rochester, New York, where the film sold out all 278 seats last month, said he would program it again since it’s best seen big.
“I can’t think of another film that’s had this exact energy and chaos,” he said.
Daniel Marra, 29, an audience member at the IFC Center, thought so, too. Standing in the lobby after the film ended, Marra said watching “Hundreds of Beavers” felt like an antidote to “bloated, huge-budget movies.”
“It shows you don’t need all that money to make something great,” he said. “It felt like a movie where there’s a lot of love.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is running on fixing one of the busiest bridges in the region. Her far-right opponent calls it an "Antifa superhighway."
The first thing Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez told donors gathered at a recent wine-and-cheese campaign fund-raiser was of the role she played in securing $ 600 million in federal funding to rebuild one of the region's main arteries, the aging Route I-5 bridge.
"Bringing that grant home was a dogfight," said Ms. Perez, 35, a first-term Democrat from a rural, working-class district in Washington State that twice voted for former President Donald J. Trump, and who is facing one of the toughest re-election races in the country this year.
"My community is going to build that bridge," she told the roomful of gray-haired donors gathered in a packed living room in Washougal, Wash., with giant windows overlooking the Columbia River. "This is our work."
Ms. Perez considers this funding to be a major coup for her district and her re-election campaign. But the bridge in one of the country's most competitive districts has become a political piñata in the race, which is all but certain to pit Ms. Perez against the far-right Republican Joe Kent, whom she beat in 2022 by less than 1 percentage point.
Mr. Kent, who denies the legitimacy of the 2020 election and has referred to those jailed for taking part in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol as "political prisoners," has branded the reconstruction plan an "Antifa superhighway." He has claimed that the proposed project, which includes a light rail and tolls, will bring unwanted urban elements from Portland into the car-centric, predominantly white community of Clark County, Washington, effectively serving as "an expressway for Portland's crime & homeless into Vancouver," as he wrote on social media.
It is an example of how Republicans, many of whom opposed President Biden's sweeping $ 1 trillion infrastructure law, are seeking to transform even the most basic of local issues into battlegrounds in the nation's culture wars in elections this year in which control of Congress is at stake. Mr. Kent's attacks, which rely on buzzwords of the hard right, place the bridge at the center of a national political discussion that vilifies the left and plays on fears of demographic change.
"We don't want the problems of downtown Portland dumped right into our district in Vancouver," Mr. Kent said recently in a Facebook Live chat. "If you look at the murder rate, the crime rate, that's the last thing we want in Vancouver."
Republicans have long opposed making investments in mass transit, favoring spending on highways instead. Mr. Kent says he wants the historic bridge to be preserved, with more highway lanes built elsewhere to alleviate congestion.
Mr. Kent declined to be interviewed, agreeing to provide comment for this story only in writing. After The New York Times sent his campaign a list of questions, his aides blasted it out in a news release along with responses.
In the release, Mr. Kent denied that he was playing on racist fears in opposing the bridge project and accused Ms. Perez of lying about her role in funding it, even as he blamed her for mishandling it.
"The drug addicts and criminals in their tent colonies that are spreading their crime from Portland into Vancouver are almost entirely white, and Antifa is overwhelmingly white," Mr. Kent wrote.
While Portland is predominantly white, it has the largest immigrant population in Oregon, and has seen more than 1,400 refugees arriving from Afghanistan since August 2021. As the city has struggled to provide temporary shelter to migrants arriving from the southern border, Mr. Kent has claimed that Democrats are allowing "illegal invaders" to flood into American communities.
Mr. Kent said Ms. Perez's true priorities were "protecting biological men's rights to invade women's sports, spaces and bathrooms" and said her entire involvement in funding the new bridge consisted of "writing a letter to Pete Buttigieg," the transportation secretary.
In an interview, Mr. Buttigieg said Ms. Perez "absolutely had a role" in the project being chosen to receive the largest grant of its kind.
"We choose projects based on their merits," Mr. Buttigieg said. "Effective advocates help to illustrate those merits."
Built in 1917, the Interstate 5 bridge is one of two major crossings between Washington State and Oregon, with about $ 132 million worth of freight crossing the bridge every day, as well as about 69,000 commuters from Ms. Perez's district. It is the main connector for an entire region of the Pacific Northwest, but it is widely believed to be at the end of its life.
The span has become so congested that for many hours a day, vehicles crawl across at 35 miles per hour. The entire structure is supported by pilings of Douglas fir sunk in mud -- "pretzel sticks in chocolate pudding," as the mayor of Vancouver, Anne McEnerny-Ogle, likes to describe it -- that puts it at high risk of total collapse in the event of a major earthquake.
"There are projects that are just too large and too complex to be done through existing funding mechanisms," Mr. Buttigieg said, explaining why the project had received such a large grant. "There needs to be extra support."
He described the Interstate 5 bridge as the "worst trucking bottleneck in the region" and said it was an example of "a bridge designed to the state of the art 100 years ago that can and must be replaced."
In 2022, Ms. Perez, who ran an auto repair shop, beat Mr. Kent, a Trump-endorsed retired Green Beret whose wife had been killed fighting ISIS, by just two votes in each precinct in the district. Now Mr. Kent is back, hoping to be swept to victory with Mr. Trump at the top of the ticket.
There are other Republicans running in the primary, but Mr. Kent's emergence from that small field is already considered a fait accompli; the state Republican Party suspended its bylaws so it could endorse him in the primary and outside groups working to keep Republican control of the House are planning to back him.
And Mr. Kent has already turned the Interstate 5 bridge into a flashpoint of his campaign.
"Voters all across the district are rallying behind my message of common sense conservatism: Build a bridge with no tolls and no light rail, get spending and inflation under control," he said.
As she crisscrossed her district in the rain and snow in her Toyota Tundra last week with her dog Uma Furman in tow, Ms. Perez said she tries not to think too much about Mr. Kent. "I really try not to get in his head that much. I have to not get in D.C.'s head and not get in Joe's head."
Ms. Perez tries to stay in the mind-set of her constituents. On Capitol Hill, Ms. Perez is the rare Democrat who often breaks with her party on major votes, often drawing the ire of progressives who she says do not value the priorities of the working class.
"On the floor, I really have to pay attention to my votes," she said. "It's this constant analysis of, 'How much can I afford to piss off people to do what I think is right?"'
Ms. Perez was one of four Democrats who voted for an annual defense policy bill that Republicans loaded full of conservative social policy mandates that would limit abortion access, transgender care and diversity training for military personnel. She defended the vote, saying it was important to support the military and that the Senate was always going to "clean up" the bill by stripping out the partisan amendments she didn't agree with.
She also sided with Republicans on a bill to repeal Mr. Biden's student loan relief initiative. And Ms. Perez has supported the censures of two Democrats, Representatives Jamaal Bowman of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Still, Mr. Kent has portrayed her as in lock-step with Democrats and Mr. Biden, attacking her for opposing a hard-line immigration bill, among others.
It has left Ms. Perez in a bit of a political no-man's land. In the capital, her social circle consists mostly of two Republican Bible study groups, one of which includes Representative Richard Hudson of North Carolina, the current chairman of the Republican House campaign arm that is actively targeting her for defeat.
Ms. Perez, along with other Democrats representing districts that Mr. Trump won, "got a pass last cycle; no one laid a glove on them," Mr. Hudson said at a recent briefing with reporters. He said his job was "educating voters about their records."
Despite that, Ms. Perez, whose father was an Evangelical pastor, says she often feels more at home among religious Republicans.
"I feel like my party is embarrassed I'm a Christian," she said. She is broadly dismissive of some of the values of her own colleagues, whom she views as out of touch.
"I hear my colleagues complain about not making enough money," she said of her fellow lawmakers, who earn $ 174,000 a year. "You know what the average income in my community is? You should be ashamed of yourselves." (The average income in her district is $ 43,266.)
When Ms. Perez was elected, her Republican opponents tried to tag her as someone who would operate as an undercover, West Coast version of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another young, working-class woman whose election to Congress no one had seen coming. But Ms. Perez said she has little in common with the progressive star from New York, nor has she had much to do with any of the other young women in Congress, even socially.
"Our districts are really, really different," she said of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. "It is very lonely, working all the time. You go back to your apartment and eat some frozen peas and go to bed."
At the evening fund-raiser last week, Ms. Perez focused mostly on her work on local issues, but pressed by donors eager to vent their concerns about Mr. Biden and his re-election campaign, she had little praise to offer.
"I'm not here to apologize for his performance or his messaging," Ms. Perez said. "I have a lot of dissatisfaction with how Biden's using his power, but when it becomes a choice between that and Trump?"
Later, sitting in her old office in her auto shop before catching a flight back to Washington, Ms. Perez tried not to get too worked up about what would happen if she lost her re-election race. She would return to this more simple life, she said, and be happy not to miss so many bedtimes with her toddler. But the idea of losing to Mr. Kent was hard to swallow.
"It's just really obnoxious and patronizing when he's assuming the mantle of fighting for the little guy," she said. "It might work for one election cycle, but people are going to need jobs. It works until the bridge collapses -- and then what?"

Russia's Balance Sheet After Two Years of War: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two years of war have remade Russia.
Isolated from the West, it is now more dependent on China. Political repression is reminiscent of the grim days of the Soviet Union.
But Russia is not the economic shambles many in the West predicted when they imposed punishing sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. Many Russians are pulling down their highest incomes in years.
Russian society has been refashioned in ways that have devastated some and lifted others. While government critics languish in jail and young men die in trenches at the front, other Russians -- especially those willing to spout the official line -- are feeling more optimistic than ever.
Here is a look at how Russia at war has changed -- suffering enormous costs by some metrics but faring better than expected by others.
Daily Life
People fled Russia in droves after the invasion and draft, more than 820,000, although some returned.
Alcoholics were diagnosed in higher numbers after more than a decade of steady declines.
Demand for psychologists increased by more than 60% in the first year of the war.
Traffic to Facebook and Instagram dropped after Russia blocked them, and use of Telegram and secure platforms like VPNs surged.
Travel abroad plummeted from pre-pandemic days.
But people are making higher wages as men deployed to the front reduce the ranks of workers back home.
And Russians are shelling out on new homes, helped by generous government subsidies.
Despite the ways that life has changed, many people say they feel positive about how President Vladimir Putin is doing. His popularity surged as the war began and is now at its highest level in seven years.
Questions remain about how honest people feel they can be in polls, given the risks. And polls have signaled, too, that a substantial number would like the war to end. But Mr. Putin has convinced many that in invading Ukraine, Russia is defending itself against an existential threat from the West.
The Economy
Mr. Putin went into the war with his financial house in order.
Government debt was low. Funds were stashed away. And a team of agile technocrats were on hand to fend off a crisis.
After an initial shock, the Russian system recovered, thanks in part to emergency financial measures, high oil prices and trade with China and India. Moscow also greatly increased state spending.
Collectively, Russia has created its own wartime economy.
Trade with Europe dropped by about 65% after Western sanctions.
Toyotas and VWs, once popular, disappeared from car assembly lines.
But trade with China, India and Turkey boomed.
By last year, Chinese cars made up six of the top 10 car brands in Russia.
The G.D.P. overall was driven up last year by an enormous war-related government stimulus.
Unemployment dropped.
And more than two-thirds of Russians say their economic well-being is the same or better.
But inflation shot up too.
The economy is now in danger of overheating. The mortgage subsidies could be fueling a housing bubble. And the market is still off-kilter in some sectors, with shortages of certain medicines, for example, and dramatic reductions in car production.
If oil prices plunge, Russia will struggle. If the military spending spree ends, all bets are off. Russia can sustain warfare in Ukraine for the foreseeable future, but its long-term economic future is in doubt.
Support for the War
For the moment, at least, the resilient economy has boosted Mr. Putin. And a campaign of propaganda and repression have allowed him to reign virtually unchallenged.
As nationalist songs top the charts -- "I am Russian, out of spite to the whole world," goes one -- less attention is being paid to the news. And the government plans to spend $ 500 million on "patriotic education" this year, including for a goose-stepping "youth army."
The percentage of people saying the country is moving in the right direction is the highest in decades, 71% last month.
Support for Russian military actions in Ukraine is even higher, though many Russians have indicated that they aren't comfortable sharing their opinion about the war.
Repression of those opposing the war is widespread.
Treason convictions nearly tripled.
The war has accelerated a crackdown on the L.G.B.T.Q. community.
Soviet-style denunciations are back, as Russians report "unpatriotic" behavior by fellow citizens to the authorities.
Freedom of assembly has been obliterated, with nearly 20,000 Russians detained for their antiwar stance.
Independent journalists have been forced to flee, and many have been declared foreign agents.
Mr. Putin's best-known critic, Aleksei A. Navalny, died after years of inhumane treatment in prison.
The number of prisoners in Russia has actually decreased dramatically.
But that's primarily because many were recruited to fight, and often die, in Ukraine.
Blood and Treasure
In the early months of the war, Mr. Putin's military made grave mistakes, but it has regrouped. Russia fended off a Western-backed Ukrainian counteroffensive and has taken the initiative on the front, buoyed by frozen American aid for Ukraine.
Still, Russia has sustained huge costs to get this far. It is far from controlling the four regions it claims to have annexed, let alone the rest of Ukraine, and Mr. Putin may need to carry out another draft.
He claims he would like to negotiate an end to the war, but skeptics see that as a ploy to undercut Western aid to Ukraine.
Moscow has made increasing gains in recent weeks. It now controls about 18 percent of Ukraine, up from 7 percent before the full-scale invasion.
But its control of Ukraine is down from the 27 percent Russian forces once occupied at their height.
The progress is coming at a higher cost. Military spending has eclipsed social spending at the federal level for the first time in Russia's 32-year post-Soviet history. It makes up about a third of the national budget.
Some 60,000 Russians have been killed in the fighting, according to U.S. officials.
That's two Russian soldiers for every square mile taken from Ukraine since the invasion.
The popularity of the war appears to ebb when it comes to support for the draft. Only 36% of Russians support another mobilization to replenish forces.
To replenish its ranks, Russia has been targeting prisons and poorer regions for recruits.
Soldiers in Ukraine are earning roughly three times the average Russian salary -- and in many cases more. Compensation to families of soldiers who die in Ukraine can be more than $ 84,000, more than nine times the average annual Russian salary.
But despite their stated support for the war, many Russians would be happy for it to end. Half of Russians say they want to start peace talks.

VW Pushing E.V.s to Lift Sales in U.S.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: It and other foreign automakers are trying to exploit upheaval caused by new technology to gain market share from their dominant rivals.
Probably only Americans of a certain age remember when the Volkswagen Beetle was the best-selling imported car in the United States and the hippest ride to a Grateful Dead concert was a Volkswagen Microbus.
Volkswagen is trying to tap some of that nostalgia in its latest push to regain the status and sales it enjoyed in the United States during the Beetle's and Microbus's heydays in the 1960s. But this time it hopes its top models will be electric.
The German carmaker is second only to Toyota globally but is a niche player in the United States. Part of its plan to revive its fortunes here is to lean on a new electric model that resembles the Microbus, the ID.Buzz, and to revive the Scout brand with a line of electric pickups and sport utility vehicles.
Last week, as giant earth movers kicked up clouds of dust, Volkswagen executives and local officials gathered near Columbia, S.C., to inaugurate the site of a factory that will build vehicles bearing the Scout badge for the first time since 1980.
Volkswagen is one of several foreign automakers that see electric cars and the upheaval they are causing as a way to challenge the dominant players in the United States. Volkswagen, which also owns Audi, Porsche, Bentley and Lamborghini, is aiming to at least double its market share in the United States by the end of the decade from a meager 4 percent now.
"This market is turning electric, and everybody's starting from scratch," Arno Antlitz, the chief financial officer of Volkswagen, said in an interview. "This is our unique opportunity to grow."
Electric vehicles have already shaken the industry rankings, emboldening Volkswagen and other foreign automakers. Battery-powered S.U.V.s and sedans helped Hyundai Motor and its sister brand Kia overtake Stellantis, the maker of Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and Ram, as the fourth-largest carmaker by sales in the United States last year.
"Electric vehicles are helping our brand to be seen as a technology leader," said José Muñoz, chief operating officer of Hyundai. They also attract a better-educated, more affluent customer than has been the case for the South Korean company's gasoline vehicles, he said in an interview.
The list of companies that dominate electric car sales looks a lot different from the top rankings for overall U.S. sales, hinting at a future when a different group of companies rule.
The top five companies in the United States for all engine types are General Motors, Toyota, Ford Motor, Hyundai and Stellantis. In electric cars, Tesla is No. 1 by a wide margin, followed by Hyundai, G.M., Ford and Volkswagen. Toyota is a minor player in electric cars.
"Just because you've been around for 120 years doesn't mean you're going to have anything in this new market," said Steven Center, the chief operating officer of Kia America.
Volvo Cars is another company hoping to take advantage of the changes wrought by electric vehicles. The Swedish carmaker, which is majority owned by Geely Holding Group of China, reported a 26 percent increase in U.S. sales last year.
Much of that growth came from hybrids that have a gasoline engine and can travel shorter distances on batteries. But Mike Cottone, president of Volvo Car for the United States and Canada, said he saw hybrids as a pathway to fully electric vehicles.
Later this year, Volvo will begin selling a Chinese-made, all-electric compact S.U.V., the EX30, which will start at $ 35,000. The company will also begin delivering the EX90, a seven-seat S.U.V. that is made in South Carolina and will start around $ 80,000.
Especially for luxury car buyers, Mr. Cottone said, "there's a lot of room for growth in the E.V. segment over the next few years."
Volkswagen has tried and failed since the 1970s to become a bigger presence in the United States, and analysts are skeptical that this time will be different. "I've seen Volkswagen set these goals before," said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Cox Automotive.
The established carmakers will not be pushovers. G.M. and Ford are also investing heavily in electric vehicles, while Toyota has said it will start producing a large electric S.U.V. in Kentucky next year.
Ms. Krebs pointed out that auto sales in the U.S. were growing slowly, making the fight for market share largely a zero-sum game. "There's this little bit of growth that everybody is going after," she said.
Volkswagen's last big push in the United States ended in scandal. In the early 2000s, the company tried to sell Americans on cars with "clean diesel" engines. It advertised the fuel, which was used in European passenger cars much more than in American cars, as more environmentally friendly than gasoline.
But the campaign collapsed in 2015 when U.S. regulators discovered that Volkswagen had used software in the vehicles to cheat on emissions tests. In reality, the cars polluted as much as long-haul trucks.
The scandal had one benefit for Volkswagen. It prompted the company to invest early in electric vehicle technology and build cars that were designed from the ground up to run on batteries, rather than make awkward modifications to gasoline models. In Europe, Volkswagen's various electric brands together outsell Tesla, according to Schmidt Automotive Research.
The person responsible for doubling Volkswagen sales in the United States is Pablo Di Si, president of Volkswagen Group of America. Mr. Di Si, originally from Argentina, said he planned to use the same strategy he deployed while overseeing the company's operations in Brazil, where Volkswagen's market share rose to more than 16 percent from 9 percent.
"You look at the segments that you think are going to be successful 10 years from now," Mr. Di Si said in an interview. "What are your gaps in the product portfolio? And then you start adding products for those particular markets."
In the United States, he said, that is likely to include gasoline cars and hybrids as well as all-electric vehicles. Volkswagen plans to import the ID.7, an electric sedan, and the ID.Buzz. Mr. Di Si hinted that there might also be a new electric vehicle that references the design of the Beetle. The last version of that car sold in the United States was the 2019 Beetle.
Volkswagen is building a $ 5 billion factory in Ontario to supply batteries to its factories in Chattanooga, Tenn., and Puebla, Mexico, which together will produce at least 80 percent of the company's cars sold in North America. That will help buyers of cars from its Volkswagen, Audi and other brands qualify for federal tax credits of up to $ 7,500 per car.
Scout will fill a major gap in Volkswagen's portfolio: pickups, among the most popular vehicles in the United States. By reviving Scout, which was one of the first passenger vehicles that could navigate rough dirt tracks as well as city streets, Volkswagen hopes to attract buyers who typically buy off-road-capable vehicles from U.S. brands like Chevrolet, Ford and Jeep.
The South Carolina factory will underscore the made-in-America vibe when the first Scouts go on sale in late 2026. Volkswagen inherited the Scout brand when the company's truck subsidiary, Traton, acquired Navistar, a U.S. company previously known as International Harvester, in 2021.
The new Scouts may borrow some parts used in other Volkswagen vehicles, company executives said, but the design will be distinct from existing vehicles like the electric ID.4 S.U.V. made in Chattanooga. Scout plans to reveal prototypes this year.
A stronger presence in the United States is "a strategic necessity," Scott Keogh, the chief executive of Volkswagen's Scout Motors division, said in South Carolina last week.
Outside the United States, Volkswagen is a behemoth, with a 26 percent share of the European market and 15 percent in China. But the company is under severe pressure in China, where sales of electric vehicles have been growing fast, allowing BYD and other Chinese carmakers to gain market share from foreign automakers. Volkswagen needs growth in the United States to compensate.
Volkswagen "wants to have a strong global footprint," Mr. Keogh said, "not have an isolated footprint, where it's only sitting strong in one region."

COLUMBIA, S.C. — Probably only Americans of a certain age remember when the Volkswagen Beetle was the bestselling imported car in the United States and the hippest ride to a Grateful Dead concert was a Volkswagen Microbus.
Volkswagen is trying to tap some of that nostalgia in its latest push to regain the status and sales it enjoyed in the United States during the Beetle’s and Microbus’ heydays in the 1960s. But this time it hopes its top models will be electric.
The German carmaker is second only to Toyota globally but is a niche player in the U.S. Part of its plan to revive its fortunes here is to lean on a new electric model that resembles the Microbus, the ID.Buzz, and to revive the Scout brand with a line of electric pickups and sport utility vehicles.
This month, as giant earth movers kicked up clouds of dust, Volkswagen executives and local officials gathered near Columbia, South Carolina, to inaugurate the site of a factory that will build vehicles bearing the Scout badge for the first time since 1980.
Volkswagen is one of several foreign automakers that see electric cars and the upheaval they are causing as a way to challenge the dominant players in the U.S. Volkswagen, which also owns Audi, Porsche, Bentley and Lamborghini, is aiming to at least double its market share in the U.S. by the end of the decade from a meager 4% now.
“This market is turning electric, and everybody’s starting from scratch,” Arno Antlitz, chief financial officer of Volkswagen, said in an interview. “This is our unique opportunity to grow.”
Electric vehicles have already shaken the industry rankings, emboldening Volkswagen and other foreign automakers. Battery-powered SUVs and sedans helped Hyundai Motor Co. and its sister brand Kia overtake Stellantis, the maker of Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and Ram, as the fourth-largest carmaker by sales in the U.S. last year.
“Electric vehicles are helping our brand to be seen as a technology leader,” said José Muñoz, chief operating officer of Hyundai. They also attract a better-educated, more affluent customer than has been the case for the South Korean company’s gasoline vehicles, he said in an interview.
The list of companies that dominate electric car sales looks a lot different from the top rankings for overall U.S. sales, hinting at a future when a different group of companies rule.
The top five companies in the U.S. for all engine types are General Motors, Toyota, Ford Motor Co., Hyundai and Stellantis. In electric cars, Tesla is No. 1 by a wide margin, followed by Hyundai, GM, Ford and Volkswagen. Toyota is a minor player in electric cars.
“Just because you’ve been around for 120 years doesn’t mean you’re going to have anything in this new market,” said Steven Center, chief operating officer of Kia America.
Volvo Cars is another company hoping to take advantage of the changes wrought by electric vehicles. The Swedish carmaker, which is majority owned by Geely Holding Group of China, reported a 26% increase in U.S. sales last year.
Much of that growth came from hybrids that have a gasoline engine and can travel shorter distances on batteries. But Mike Cottone, president of Volvo Cars for the U.S. and Canada, said he saw hybrids as a pathway to fully electric vehicles.

Drivers Are Fed Up With 'Candy Store' for Car Thieves: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Whenever Dennis Wilson wants to take a drive in his new SUV, he has to set aside an extra 15 minutes. That's about how long it takes to remove the car's steering wheel club, undo four tire locks and lower a yellow bollard before backing out of his driveway.
His Honda CR-V is also fitted with two alarm systems, a vehicle tracking device and, for good measure, four Apple AirTags. Its remote-access key fob rests in a Faraday bag, to jam illicit unlocking signals.
As a final touch, he mounted two motion-sensitive floodlights on his house and aimed them at the driveway in his modest neighborhood in Toronto.
But all of these security gadgets, Mr. Wilson is convinced, will do no more than delay what seems inevitable: Toronto's seasoned auto thieves won't be deterred by the defensive gear, and they'll make off with this Honda SUV just as they did with its predecessor -- and its insurance replacement, which they returned to steal.
"By no means do I think that I've stopped them," Mr. Wilson said. "All I've done is made it take an extra 10 minutes to steal my car."
While there has been a surge in car thefts across Canada -- up 24 percent in 2022, the most recent year nationwide statistics were available -- the scourge has hit the Toronto area particularly hard, creating a mix of paranoia, vigilance and resentment.
So pervasive are car thefts in Canada's largest city, up 150 percent in the past six years, that the issue has become something of a common bond among vehicle owners. If not a victim themselves of a theft, or thefts, many people seem to know someone whose car was swiped, and just about everyone can instantly recall one of the car theft headlines that news outlets have had plenty of opportunity to publish.
Social media groups have formed to crowdsource help for car sightings. But the comments are filled with people telling owners to resign themselves to the fact that their car is probably already in a shipping container headed overseas.
"Organized crime is becoming more brazen, and the international black market for the stolen cars is expanding," said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, speaking this month in Ottawa at a hastily convened auto theft summit.
The meeting was intended to reassure Canadians that the government was aware of the issue and that it was considering a number of responses, including increasing penalties for auto thieves, investing in the border agency and banning imports of key fob hacking devices.
The government is not only aware of the problem, it also hasn't been spared: Two government-issued Toyota Highlanders were stolen three times in Ottawa from the current and previous justice ministers.
Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party, has repeatedly criticized Mr. Trudeau on the issue, blaming the government for being excessively lenient in bail and sentencing for offenders.
The police have received new funding, including for better surveillance equipment, but the profit motive for thieves -- as much as 20,000 Canadian dollars, or $ 14,800 per car -- has, so far, made the problem intractable.
Car thefts have escalated to "national crisis" levels, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, an industry group, which said insurers paid out a record 1.2 billion Canadian dollars, or about $ 890 million, in theft claims in 2022.
For victims, it's a dizzying, and sometimes traumatizing, experience.
"I was not able to digest the truth that the car had been stolen," said Kamran Hussain, whose leased 2022 Toyota Highlander was stolen in January. Mr. Hussain's work as a telecom field sales representative requires him to have access to a car. He's borrowing one from a friend while he weighs what to do next.
"Either I have to buy a new car or I have to switch jobs," he said. "I have no other choice."
Demand for vehicle tracking from insurers in Ontario has about doubled business at Tag Tracking, a Montreal-based company, in the past two years, said Freddy Marcantonio, its vice president. Quebec insurers often require the Tag system for high-risk cars in the province, which for decades has grappled with auto thefts largely because many thieves favor Montreal's port for getting their hot wheels quickly out of the country.
Thanks in part to the well-known prevalence of tracking systems in Quebec, thieves have turned to Toronto for easier pickings.
"It's like getting a credit card and telling a kid to go in a candy store and buy whatever you want, and that's why they moved to Ontario," Mr. Marcantonio said. "It's a free market for them there."
But as criminals have adapted their behavior -- "I like to say they have Ph.D.s in cars theft," Mr. Marcantonio said -- so have Toronto's car owners, with many motivated to take a step as simple as clearing the junk out of their garages so they can stow their cars at night.
Homeowners are increasingly looking for solutions to protect their driveways, too, with some winning the praise of the police for installing bollards, like Mr. Wilson has done.
Last year, Achoy Ladrick founded Bollard Boys GTA -- for Greater Toronto Area, an acronym unfortunately shared with the popular video game Grand Theft Auto.
"With this company, I've been able to bring that confidence back, bring that peace of mind back to people," said Mr. Ladrick, 23, adding that one client installed four bollards after three Range Rover thefts.
The bread and butter of thieves are the most prosaic cars, like Mr. Wilson's Honda CR-V, or Ford F-150 trucks. Luxury cars are trophies.
Some wealthy collectors store their cars in secret locations with round-the-clock security and dogs at night, but thieves can still win out.
Nick Elworthy wanted to get every last detail exactly right on his Ferrari, from the stitching down to the unique color, a candy-apple red slightly deeper than the sports car's signature shade. He got to drive it only a few times before it was stolen last summer.
But the police in Ottawa stumbled on it when an officer noticed a Range Rover being backed into a shipping container on a rural property. A second car in the container was Mr. Elworthy's Ferrari.
"I was absolutely ecstatic when I got the call from that officer," he said. "I was literally jumping up and down."
Most drivers discover they've become a victim when confronted with the initially baffling site of an empty parking space.
When Myra White couldn't find a 2021 Jeep Wrangler that she was sure she had parked at a residential corner in downtown Toronto, she first doubted her memory before she realized it had been stolen. To her surprise, the police found it in a rail yard, with a smashed rear passenger window.
"I'm trying to think of what we're going to do with the car when we get it back because I don't want, of course, for it to happen again," said Ms. White, an executive at a Toronto logistics company. "It's something endemic in the city."
For the exasperated Mr. Wilson, there has been one recent consolation to being a Toronto car owner: This year's mild winter means he hasn't often had to pull out his heat gun or de-icer spray to unfreeze his multiple locks.
Given that he bikes to work -- and given all that is required for him to try to fend off the thieves who hanker for his Honda -- he said his mind is made up on what his next move will be if he is victimized again.
"If they steal this car, I think I'm done," he said, adding, "When they come with their antenna and they put it by the window, the only two fobs they're going to pick up are the two cars that they've already stolen. I left those for them."

TORONTO — Whenever Dennis Wilson wants to take a drive in his new SUV, he has to set aside an extra 15 minutes. That’s about how long it takes to remove the car’s steering wheel club, undo four tire locks and lower a yellow bollard before backing out of his driveway.

Last year, Achoy Ladrick founded Bollard Boys GTA — for Greater Toronto Area, and an initialism unfortunately shared with the popular video game Grand Theft Auto.
“With this company, I’ve been able to bring that confidence back, bring that peace of mind back to people,” said Ladrick, 23, adding that one client installed four bollards after three Range Rover thefts.
The bread and butter of thieves are the most prosaic cars, like Wilson’s Honda CR-V or Ford F-150 trucks. Luxury cars are trophies.
Some wealthy collectors store their cars in secret locations with round-the-clock security and dogs at night, but thieves can still win out.
Nick Elworthy wanted to get every last detail exactly right on his Ferrari, from the stitching down to the unique color, a candy-apple red slightly deeper than the sports car’s signature shade. He got to drive it only a few times before it was stolen last summer.
But police in Ottawa stumbled on it when an officer noticed a Range Rover being backed into a shipping container on a rural property. A second car in the container was Elworthy’s Ferrari.
“I was absolutely ecstatic when I got the call from that officer,” he said. “I was literally jumping up and down.”
Most drivers discover they have become a victim when confronted with the initially baffling site of an empty parking space.
When Myra White couldn’t find a 2021 Jeep Wrangler that she was sure she had parked at a residential corner in downtown Toronto, she first doubted her memory before she realized it had been stolen. To her surprise, police found it in a rail yard, with a smashed rear passenger window.
“I’m trying to think of what we’re going to do with the car when we get it back because I don’t want, of course, for it to happen again,” said White, an executive at a Toronto logistics company. “It’s something endemic in the city.”
For the exasperated Wilson, there has been one recent consolation to being a Toronto car owner: This year’s mild winter means he hasn’t often had to pull out his heat gun or de-icer spray to unfreeze his multiple locks.
Given that he bikes to work — and given all that is required for him to try to fend off the thieves who hanker for his Honda — he said his mind is made up on what his next move will be if he is victimized again.
“If they steal this car, I think I’m done,” he said, adding, “When they come with their antenna and they put it by the window, the only two fobs they’re going to pick up are the two cars that they’ve already stolen. I left those for them.”

Arizona Braces for the Impact of a University's Budget Crisis: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The public university, the largest employer in the Tucson area, says it's facing a $ 177 million shortfall. Critics worry that lower-tier workers and Arizona students will be hit hardest by efforts to cut back.
Like thousands of people in southern Arizona, Josh Ramos's fate is intertwined with the University of Arizona. His mother's job as a university accountant supports the family, and Mr. Ramos's education, by qualifying him for a discount that cuts his tuition by 75 percent.
"This job has brought us a lot of stability," said Mr. Ramos, 18, a college freshman.
But the University of Arizona stunned the state late last year by revealing a $ 177 million shortfall in its more than $ 2 billion annual budget. Now, as the 40,000-student campus braces for layoffs, Mr. Ramos is worried. About his mother's job. About having to drop out. About his family's future.
And the whole state is worried that southern Arizona will suffer if the region's largest, most dependable employer loses credibility and trust.
The turmoil has shaken the heavily Democratic city of Tucson, where many residents and university employees blame mismanagement at the top.
They say university leaders bumbled into catastrophe by spending millions of dollars on top-end salaries, athletics, risky expansion efforts and tuition subsidies for out-of-state students. Now they worry that middle-class workers and Arizona students will be hit hardest by efforts to cut budgets.
"It's going to strike at the heart of Tucson," said Leila Hudson, an associate professor and chair of the faculty.
Other flagship public schools including Penn State and West Virginia University have grappled with budget cuts recently because of inflation and sagging enrollment. But the problems at Arizona galled many people there because the school appeared to be booming. Student numbers and revenues are rising, and the university is earning more money from research grants and state funding.
The university's administrators say that inflation, the pandemic and widespread overspending have contributed to its financial problems, and that they are trying to fix the budget without hurting the university's academics or research. They say that despite the deficit, the university is not in danger of running out of cash.
"The university has lost some credibility in the community, and a little trust we need to regain," John Arnold, the interim chief financial officer, said in an interview. Mr. Arnold is also the executive director of the Arizona Board of Regents, which oversees Arizona's public universities.
The university's response has failed to satisfy its critics, or Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat. In a letter to university leaders last month, she said there was "no coherent vision" for a way forward, and criticized the school for a lack of accountability and transparency and threatened to change its leadership.
To some, the financial mess highlights a widening class divide in higher education, where top administrators and coaches can make $ 1 million a year while lower-tier instructors and part-time faculty say they scrape by on less than $ 50,000.
Faculty members say they already endured furloughs during the pandemic, and that teaching slots and staff jobs have sat empty in recent years. While they struggled to keep up, they said, the university acquired a troubled for-profit online college and spent more than $ 60 million to prop up the athletic department.
The university's president, Robert C. Robbins, struck an optimistic tone in a Feb. 9 update that described the school's financial plans, saying, "I am confident that, together, we will emerge from this challenge stronger."
But that has not assuaged the anxiety and anger on campus, which grew after The Arizona Daily Star reported that Lisa Rulney, the university's chief financial officer who resigned amid the mess, had stayed on as an adviser and was still being paid a $ 500,000 salary. Ms. Rulney did not respond to requests for comment.
"We're all on the same stormy seas, but they're in yachts, and we're in rafts," said Gary Rhoades, an education professor who has spent months delving into the university's spending to understand the roots of the problems.
The university has now frozen hiring and pay raises, and faculty members who have been tracking the budget discussions said they were bracing for as many as 1,000 job cuts. Earlier this month, the administration asked individual schools and departments to sketch out budget cuts from 5 to 15 percent.
A union representing campus workers says about a handful of people on year-to-year contracts have already been laid off.
Students and campus workers have responded by holding protests outside the administration building, urging leaders to "chop from the top."
They urged the university to start with its dozens of vice presidents instead of targeting rank-and-file workers. Mr. Arnold, the interim head of finance, said the university would be scrutinizing "every one" of its vice presidents. Expanding bureaucracies have also plagued other universities and colleges, and led to higher administrative costs and tuition.
The chasm between the university's five- and six-figure workers is particularly acute in a city like Tucson, population 540,000, where an influx of buyers during the pandemic helped push median house prices to $ 385,000 from about $ 250,000.
Even the university's food pantry is straining: It announced this winter that rising prices and more users had forced it to stop offering hygiene products and cut back on some of its food options.
"I'm so excited to work here, and I feel like the school is not excited to have me," said Spencer Gantt, who works in information technology and is a member of United Campus Workers Arizona, the local union that has organized most of the demonstrations against layoffs.
Jobs like Mr. Gantt's may be some of the most vulnerable. A financial plan released this month showed that the university would start cutting costs in administrative areas such as human resources, marketing, communications and, to Mr. Gantt's dismay, information technology.
"I'm very scared," he said. He worried about not having a job a month from now, and said he didn't even know whether he was at risk of being laid off. He is putting off getting an oil change on his Toyota Corolla until he has some certainty.
Some students and staff members say they have started to notice the effects of the money problems. Samantha Gonsalves Wetherell, 21, said she was saddened that the university delayed releasing a climate-action plan that she had spent much of her undergraduate years helping to create.
"We're all looking for answers, but nobody knows," said Maria Sohn Hasman, a program coordinator working at the university. "I wake up every single day wondering if today's the day I'm going to be laid off."
The university has yet to detail all of the cuts, but says it plans to save $ 27 million by permanently eliminating vacant jobs. It also said it would hire outside consultants to scrutinize the finances of the athletic department and a polarizing new online venture, the University of Arizona Global Campus.
The university started the program by paying $ 1 to acquire a for-profit, online-only school called Ashford University in 2020. The deal added tens of thousands of new online students to the university's rolls.
But critics say it also saddles the university with more than $ 200 million in new costs, and yokes the university to a school that state and federal officials say cheated students by misleading them about costs and the value of their degrees, leaving them with little to show but debt.
On Tuesday the Arizona Board of Regents released a report detailing how and why it had acquired Ashford, in response to Arizona's governor demanding more information about the deal. The board said it had not "brushed aside" concerns about Ashford's business practices, and said Ashford had assured the university that those "practices had been corrected."
Lawyers who have represented Ashford's parent company did not respond to requests for comment.
The university said its global campus had been "cash positive" for the university so far, largely because the university received an infusion of money with the acquisition. The global campus is expected to run a $ 2.5 million deficit in the current fiscal year but make money next year, according to the university's budget projections.
Pam Scott, a university spokeswoman, said the new campus lets the university "provide thousands of more students access to a high quality, world-class education -- students who otherwise might not have the opportunity." Since taking over, the university says it has shifted focus away from recruiting students and toward keeping them in school and on a path to success.
With nearly 17,000 workers, the university is the largest employer in the Tucson area, and it says it pumps about $ 4 billion into the economy each year.
Even amid the turmoil, the sunny red brick campus pulses with energy and academic feats.
Enormous mirrors built in a university lab beneath the football bleachers are used to peer into the deepest corners of space. Students inside a campus building made to resemble a desert canyon are busy learning about sustainable desert agriculture. Scientists who have pioneered the science of studying tree rings are using them to decipher climate change and ancient disasters.
One afternoon last week, Hadi Alim, 22, breezed past all of it as he contemplated whether his family would have a future on campus. His father, who works maintaining the university's computer networks, has started driving for Uber in case he loses his job.
Mr. Alim, a college junior studying sustainably built environments, pays his own tuition, which he said he could afford only because of the discount he gets as the son of an employee. He said he had started looking at finishing college abroad, somewhere cheaper, as a fallback.
"I just try and take it one day at a time," he said, "and graduate as soon as possible."

In Japan, Stocks Surpass Peak Set in 1989: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The News
Stocks in Japan rose to a record high on Thursday, surpassing a level last seen 34 years ago when the country was at the peak of its economic ascendancy, before it sank into decades of low growth.
The Nikkei 225, a benchmark stock index in Japan, moved 2.1 percent higher to 39,098, breaking through its previous high of 38,915.87 reached on Dec. 29, 1989. Stocks in Japan have been on a broadly steady rebound for over a decade, but they have moved sharply higher in the past year. The Nikkei is up 17 percent since the start of 2024.
The rally on Thursday came after bumper earnings from Nvidia, the maker of chips used in artificial intelligence, started a global wave of rising stock prices, pushing up major benchmarks in Europe and the United States.
What has changed in Japan's economy to spark the stock surge?
Stocks in Japan have looked cheap because of a weak yen, which has been a boon to exporters that make their profits overseas. Important changes to the corporate sector have also given shareholders more rights, allowing them to push for changes that favor their stock holdings.
And in a contrast with other parts of the world, rising inflation in Japan recently has been seen as a sign that things are headed in the right direction, after decades of falling prices and sluggish economic growth discouraged people and companies from spending.
Japan's stocks have also benefited from a downturn in China, where economic growth has slowed under the weight of a plunge in real estate and a host of systemic and political challenges. Chinese markets have recently traded at low points that hadn't been reached since a rout in 2015.
Foreign investors are playing an important role in the market's rise.
Investors from abroad have been enthusiastic buyers of Japanese stocks, pumping a net $ 14 billion into the market in January, according to data from Japan Exchange Group, a stark shift from the roughly $ 3 billion that they pulled out in December.
Corporate profits are strong, another reason investors are pouring money into Japan. Earnings at large Japanese companies are set to rise by more than 40 percent in their latest quarterly results, according to Goldman Sachs. The biggest companies, like Toyota and SoftBank, have also reported some of the biggest earnings surprises, the bank's analysts noted. Toyota recently rose to a record market value for a Japanese company, about $ 330 billion, surpassing the mark set in 1987 by the telecom conglomerate NTT.
"The skeptics continue to argue that Japan never changes, and foreigners always get disappointed, so get out now," the Goldman analysts wrote. But they said the recent run-up in stocks looked less overblown than during past rallies that fizzled out.
According to a survey of fund managers conducted by Bank of America, buying Japanese stocks is the third most popular trade this year, but it remains far short of the first two: betting against China's stock market and buying up the group of behemoth tech stocks, like Apple and Microsoft, known as the "Magnificent Seven."
What will the Bank of Japan do next?
Economic growth in Japan remains on shaky ground. Numbers released last week showed that the nation's economy unexpectedly shrank in the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 3.1 percent for the United States.
Much of the world has raised interest rates to combat inflation, but Japan has kept them low in an attempt to stoke it, preferring to intervene in markets to prevent its currency from weakening too quickly, or government bond yields rising too sharply.
With growth just starting to recover, the central bank is trying to gauge when it would be appropriate to start raising interest rates -- supporting its currency -- without stamping out inflation altogether.
Complicating matters is the economic impact of the earthquake that hit the Noto Peninsula, on the western shoreline of the country, in January. Japan's economy is also vulnerable should much of the rest of the world start to slow down.
For the time being, economists forecast that the central bank will raise interest rates out of negative territory, but hold them at zero for the rest of the year.

Oversight Of Musk Has Tesla's Chair In Hot Seat: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Robyn Denholm, who has led the electric car company's board for more than five years, has been criticized for not serving as a check on Mr. Musk.
Elon Musk, the chief executive and public face of Tesla, is constantly making news and broadcasting his opinions on his social media site, X. But the electric car company has another leader -- one who maintains a much lower profile.
For more than five years, Tesla's board has been led by Robyn M. Denholm, a technology executive who rarely speaks in public outside her native Australia and posts barely anything on X.
To some analysts and investors, Ms. Denholm is the "adult in the room" who has helped Mr. Musk turn Tesla into the world's most valuable automaker. But to her critics, she has failed at her most important job: serving as a check on Mr. Musk.
Late last month, a Delaware judge sharply criticized Ms. Denholm's leadership while striking down Mr. Musk's 2018 compensation package, which is worth more than $ 50 billion. Ms. Denholm took a "lackadaisical approach to her oversight obligations" at Tesla, said Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery.
The judge also questioned whether Ms. Denholm could be independent from Mr. Musk, because her job on Tesla's board had earned her more than $ 280 million. In court last year, Ms. Denholm described that pay as "life changing." Her compensation greatly exceeds what other large U.S. companies like Apple and Alphabet, Google's parent, pay the independent chairs on their boards.
"Musk operates as if free of board oversight," the judge said in her ruling.
Mr. Musk has railed against the ruling, and he said he planned to ask shareholders to authorize Tesla to move its incorporation to Texas, where the company has its headquarters. The court ruling also means the board must fashion a new pay package for him.
Separately, Mr. Musk demanded last month, two weeks before the Delaware ruling, that Tesla's board significantly increase his control over the company if it wanted him to continue developing products based on artificial intelligence at Tesla. Mr. Musk, who owns about 13 percent of the company's stock, wants voting rights equivalent to at least 25 percent of Tesla's shares.
Ms. Denholm will be closely involved in any decision to change where the company is incorporated and in negotiations with Mr. Musk over his pay and desire for more control. She has said nothing publicly about these matters and did not respond to a request for an interview.
Ms. Denholm has spent over 40 years in operational and financial jobs at big companies in Australia and the United States. She is widely considered a calm, understated presence with an appetite for occasional calculated risks. As chief financial officer at Juniper Networks, for example, she resisted pressure from Wall Street to cut costs and lay off employees, defending the company's decision to invest in research and development. The strategy paid off, some analysts said.
"She's very down-to-earth, very straight, very independent-minded, a very relaxed character," said Pierre Ferragu, a managing partner at New Street Research who covered Ms. Denholm at Juniper. "I don't think you could have found a better chairman for this very unique job" at Tesla.
Perhaps the biggest risk she has taken is agreeing to lead Tesla's board.
Addressing an audience at an event in 2022 in Sydney, Australia, Ms. Denholm said she had friends who advised her not to accept Mr. Musk's offer after he agreed to step down as chairman in 2018 as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The settlement stemmed from Mr. Musk's claim, on Twitter, that he had secured the funding to take Tesla private even though his plan to do so was in an embryonic state.
Her friends had warned her that she would be leading the board of a company "with a contrarian founder, and that at the time was not profitable," Ms. Denholm said, according to reports of the speech. She initially turned Mr. Musk down, according to legal filings, but he asked her again, and she agreed and resigned from her job as chief financial officer at Telstra, an Australian telecommunications company.
One of three children of European immigrants to Australia, Ms. Denholm, 60, grew up in the suburbs of Sydney, where she attended what she has described as a "garden-variety public school." On weekends and during school vacations, she helped her parents balance the books and service cars at their gas station.
Ms. Denholm studied economics at the University of Sydney and started her career at Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm. She had a series of jobs at large companies like Toyota in Australia, where she was among a few female executives, and Sun Microsystems and Juniper in Silicon Valley.
Besides her position on Tesla's board, Ms. Denholm serves as chair for the Tech Council of Australia, the country's highest-profile technology industry association. She has owned at least three red Teslas and, in a Sky News interview in 2014, described herself as "genuinely curious." Her family investment office, started in 2021, has a focus on women-led tech start-ups and owns a 30 percent stake in her hometown's two basketball teams -- the Sydney Kings and Sydney Flames.
Ms. Denholm was not acquainted with Mr. Musk before 2014, when a member of the company's board recruited her, according to legal filings. While she has praised Mr. Musk's vision, discipline and resilience in interviews, she has mostly avoided discussing him or his erratic comments on X.
Conor Wynn, an expert in corporate decision-making at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, said Mr. Musk might have chosen Ms. Denholm because she was so different from him and had skills he might not have.
"You don't want just the mad genius at the top creating stuff," Mr. Wynn said. "You need somebody who can translate it into action, and be people-focused and keep the operations moving."
But other experts said Ms. Denholm's job was not just to complement Mr. Musk. As the leader of Tesla's board, she has a duty to oversee the chief executive and do what is best for all of the company's shareholders.
"When Denholm took over in 2018, it was hoped she would be the adult in the room, possibly even a mother figure who could tame this wild child," said Jo-Ellen Pozner, associate professor of management at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University. "That has clearly not happened."
But, Ms. Pozner said, Ms. Denholm may not have been able to manage Mr. Musk because almost all of the other Tesla directors have personal or financial ties to him. One board member is Mr. Musk's brother, Kimbal. Several others have been close to Mr. Musk personally, professionally or both for many years.
"It doesn't seem like she was set up for success in reining in Elon Musk," Ms. Pozner said.
Ms. Denholm's job is likely to get tougher this year than it has been. In addition to looming decisions about the company's incorporation and Mr. Musk's demand for greater control, Tesla's stock is down about 24 percent this year because investors are worried about slowing sales and slumping profits.
At a conference last year, Ms. Denholm described how she dealt with uncertainty and doubt. Early in her career, confronted with jitters about a looming international move, Ms. Denholm said, she called her father for advice.
"He said: 'Robyn, what's the worst thing that can happen? You screw up and you have to come home?"' she told an audience in Sydney in May. "I've sort of taken that approach."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gaza's hospitals have emerged as a focal point in Israel's war with Hamas, with each side citing how the other has pulled the centers into the conflict as proof of the enemy's disregard for the safety of civilians.
In four months of war, Israeli troops have entered several hospitals, including the Qatari Hospital, Kamal Adwan Hospital and Al-Rantisi Specialized Hospital for Children, to search for weapons and fighters. But Al-Shifa Hospital has taken on particular significance because it is Gaza's largest medical facility, and because of Israel's claims that Hamas leaders operated a command-and-control center beneath it. Hamas and the hospital's staff insisted it was only a medical center.
Al-Shifa's value as a military target was not immediately clear in the days after the Nov. 15 raid, even after the Israeli military released the tunnel video that The Times used to create a 3-D model.
But evidence examined by The New York Times suggests Hamas used the hospital for cover, stored weapons inside it and maintained a hardened tunnel beneath the complex that was supplied with water, power and air-conditioning.
Classified Israeli intelligence documents, obtained and reviewed by The Times, indicate that the tunnel is at least 700 feet long, twice as long as the military revealed publicly, and that it extends beyond the hospital and likely connects to Hamas's larger underground network.
According to classified images reviewed by The Times, Israeli soldiers found underground bunkers, living quarters and a room that appeared to be wired for computers and communications equipment along a part of the tunnel beyond the hospital -- chambers that were not visible in the video released by the Israeli military.
The Israeli military, however, has struggled to prove that Hamas maintained a command-and-control center under the hospital. Critics of the Israeli military say the evidence does not support its early claims, noting that it had distributed material before the raid showing five underground complexes and also had said the tunnel network could be reached from wards inside a hospital building. Israel has publicly revealed the existence of only one tunnel entrance on the grounds of the hospital, at the shack outside its main buildings.
The Israeli military says that it moved carefully because the tunnel was booby-trapped and ran out of time to investigate before it destroyed the tunnel and withdrew from the hospital. Israeli and Qatari officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Israel had to leave the hospital to comply with the terms of a temporary cease-fire in late November.
American officials have said their own intelligence backs up the Israeli case, including evidence that Hamas used Al-Shifa to hold at least a few hostages. American intelligence also indicates that Hamas fighters evacuated the complex days before Israeli forces moved into Al-Shifa, destroying documents and electronics as they left.
Hospitals are protected under international law, even if they provide medical care for combatants, but their use for other acts that are "harmful to the enemy" can make them legitimate targets for military action. But any action must weigh the expected military advantage against the expected harm to civilians.
Al-Shifa, Israeli officials have argued, is an example of Hamas's willingness to use hospitals as cover and turn civilians into human shields. But critics say it is also an example of the toll on civilians when Israeli forces surround and raid hospitals to pursue Hamas fighters or rescue hostages, operations that can cut off doctors from fuel and supplies and residents from urgently needed medical care.
Five premature babies died at Al-Shifa before the raid "due to lack of electricity and fuel," according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which helped organize the evacuation of 31 other infants.
"We all know that the health care system is or has collapsed," Lynn Hastings, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, has told reporters.
Israel launched its war in Gaza after the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, in which around 1,200 people were killed and over 200 were taken hostage. Since the start of the war, more than 28,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to health officials there.
In the face of international opprobrium over its raids on hospitals, Israel has publicized evidence that it says shows that Hamas hid fighters among the ill and injured, and held hostages in the facilities. The Israeli military said that before entering Al-Shifa, it warned the buildings' occupants, opened evacuation routes and sent Arabic-speaking medical teams along with the soldiers.
Hamas and Gazan health officials say the hospitals have served only as medical centers. But beyond accusing the Israeli military of planting evidence at hospitals, Hamas and Gazan officials have not directly refuted the evidence presented by Israel.
The Israeli military said it apprehended dozens of "terror operatives" at Kamal Adwan Hospital in December, and released videos, at the time, of men carrying weapons. A spokesman for the health ministry in Gaza said that Israeli forces had asked the hospital's administrators to hand over the weapons of its security guards.
After the raid on the Qatari Hospital, the commonly used name for the Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani Hospital for Rehabilitation and Prosthetics, the Israeli military showed a video on Nov. 5 of what it said was the entrance to "a tunnel that was being used for terror infrastructures" on the hospital's grounds.
But the video appears to show something else: a water storage area built in 2016, when the hospital was constructed, according to engineering plans and images from the hospital's construction reviewed by The Times.
The Israeli military declined to provide additional imagery to support its assertion that this was a tunnel entryway or part of a tunnel complex.
Just before the Al-Shifa raid, Israeli forces entered Al-Rantisi hospital, on Nov. 13, soon after its remaining patients and staff had left. Within days, the military released two videos that showed weapons and explosives it said it found there, and a room where it said hostages had been kept. The health ministry in Gaza disputed the assertions made in the videos and said the weapons were planted.
One of the videos released by Israel showed troops rushing into the hospital and appearing to find explosives, weapons and the hostage room. In the other, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, chief spokesman for the Israeli military, showed off guns, explosives and other weapons that he said were found in the basement of the hospital.
The video included footage of a piece of paper taped to a wall in the hospital's basement. Admiral Hagari said the paper -- a grid with Arabic words and numbers within each square -- could be a schedule for guarding hostages "where every terrorist writes his name."
The Gazan health ministry said it was nothing more than a work schedule. But the calendar begins on Oct. 7, the day of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, and an Arabic title written at the top uses the militants' name for the assault: "Al Aqsa Flood Battle, 7/10/2023."
Given its size and history, taking control of Al-Shifa was always a more important goal for the Israeli military than the other smaller facilities.
There is substantial independent evidence that Hamas constructed a vast tunnel network across Gaza. Senior Israeli defense officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, estimate the network is between 350 and 450 miles -- extraordinary figures for a territory that at its longest point is only 25 miles. The officials estimate there are thousands of entrances to the network.
There is also established documentation that Hamas used Al-Shifa before the war to mask some of its activities. During Israel's three-week war with Hamas in 2008, armed Hamas fighters in civilian clothing were seen roaming Al-Shifa's corridors and killing an Israeli collaborator, according to a Times correspondent reporting in Gaza at the time. Six years later, during the next round of fighting, the militants routinely held news conferences at the hospital and used it as a safe meeting place for Hamas officials to speak with journalists.
After that war, Amnesty International reported that Hamas had used abandoned areas of Al-Shifa, "including the outpatients' clinic area, to detain, interrogate, torture and otherwise mistreat suspects, even as other parts of the hospital continued to function as a medical center."
Israel's critics, though, countered with statements made at the time by two Norwegian doctors, who described themselves as pro-Palestinian activists and had worked in Gaza during the 2014 war. They insisted that they saw no Hamas presence at Al-Shifa.
Israel has also released video footage, taken by the hospital's own security cameras, which it says shows two hostages being brought to Al-Shifa shortly after being abducted in the Oct. 7 attack.
The Al-Shifa tunnel was discovered by following ducts that ran underground from air-conditioning units that were powered by the hospital's electricity supply and mounted on one of its buildings, officials said. Israeli soldiers also found evidence that the hospital's water supply was being fed to the tunnel.
The Israeli military has also displayed weapons and other equipment it said were found inside Al-Shifa, including grenades placed near an MRI machine. Among the cache presented to journalists were belongings that Israeli officials said had been taken from hostages, including a bag emblazoned with the name Be'eri, a kibbutz attacked by Hamas.
The military also said it found weapons in Al-Shifa's parking lot, and a Toyota vehicle identical to those used in the Oct. 7 attack and loaded with the same equipment that militants carried during the raid, including guns and rocket-propelled grenades. Israeli officials speculated that it was a spare vehicle not used in the attack.
Some of what the Israeli military has shown so far does not wholly match the description of a terrorist headquarters that it offered ahead of its ground invasion of Gaza on Oct. 27.
Underneath Al-Shifa, the Israeli military wrote in a lengthy post on its website, "lies a labyrinth of tunnels and underground compounds used by Hamas's leaders to direct terrorist activities and rocket fire and to manufacture and store a variety of weapons and ammunition."
There may no longer be a way to directly assess that claim. Israeli forces remained at Al-Shifa for a little more than a week.
Hours before Israeli forces left the hospital on Nov. 24, soldiers lined the tunnel with explosives and destroyed it in a blast that sent plumes of smoke high into the air and rocked buildings on the ground above.

Full text: Here is how our critic saw the Super Bowl commercials from best to worst.
In the spirit of "Who actually watches the game?," here is our ranking of Sunday night's Super Bowl commercials, from best to worst.
Ground rules: Only ads shown on the national CBS broadcast during the game were eligible. Not included are some non-commercial (religious, political, social advocacy) spots and most movie trailers and promos for television and streaming broadcasts.
The Best of the Bunch

Squarespace
Aliens (a theme in this year's ads) come to earth and can't get our attention until they figure out how to get on the internet. It is handsomely directed by Martin Scorsese (working with the "Barbie" cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto), though it's not at all clear what's being advertised.

Microsoft

STōK Cold Brew
Anthony Hopkins lampoons his own gravitas to sell cold brew coffee as well as promote the Wrexham soccer club. Sir Anthony is in good form but his 2016 spot for TurboTax was funnier.

Inoffensive but Forgettable
They tried. Nobody got hurt.
T-Mobile
Zach Braff and Donald Faison of "Scrubs" join Jason Momoa for a "Flashdance"-inspired musical ode to cutting the cord. Lively, though is this something anyone still needs to be told? (The first T-Mobile spot, with celebrities doing goofy auditions, was more pedestrian.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Pluto TV
A farm grows human couch potatoes who are irrigated with constant streams of their favorite programming. This elaborately staged comic-dystopian scenario is awfully close for comfort.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
'IF'
Randall Park pretends to be John Krasinski in a promo, inspired by a similar gag in "The Office," for Krasinski's imaginary-friend film "IF." Park spars amusingly with Ryan Reynolds but yes, every movie trailer really is too long.

Hot Takes and Walking Ads Fuel Super Bowl's Radio Row: [Sports Desk]

Full text: During Super Bowl week, current and former athletes help companies hawk their wares on radio stations and podcasts. "It is a phenomenal quid pro quo," one host said.
Chad Johnson said that the winning coach in the Super Bowl would be showered with red Gatorade. He predicted that wide receiver Kadarius Toney, who has not played in the Kansas City Chiefs' three playoff games, would score the first touchdown.
And midway through his segment of a digital show inside a Las Vegas hotel convention center, Johnson, who is known by many as Ochocinco, proclaimed that if the Chiefs lost to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, he would divorce his wife and forgo sex for the rest of the year.
"That's a lot you're putting on this," said Michael Bolling, a host for the sports website Bleacher Report.
"That's how confident I am," replied Johnson, who was appearing as a guest.
During his 11 N.F.L. seasons, primarily with the Cincinnati Bengals, Johnson was one of the league's most boisterous personalities, remembered for his creative touchdown celebrations and adopting the name Ochocinco, after his No. 85 jersey. That is a particularly valuable commodity on Radio Row, the primary vessel for companies to hawk their wares at one of the largest entertainment events of the year.
More than 100 radio personalities, broadcast companies and other outlets host segments, mostly with current or retired N.F.L. players who are paid by brands to promote products in the week leading up to the game.
"You have everyone here -- it's one center location," said Doug Sanders, Johnson's marketing agent for the past seven years. "Everyone's here around this game and excited for it, but also excited for the players, and you're able to capitalize and gain visibility for whatever they're trying to promote."
Radio Row started in earnest in 1993, when about 10 radio stations descended on a Los Angeles-area hotel to broadcast shows ahead of Super Bowl XXVII. The ragtag setup consisted of eight-foot-long tables, arranged side-by-side, with folding chairs. This year, at the bustling Mandalay Bay Convention Center, companies like Toyota and Bounty constructed extravagant sets with fluorescent lights and scrolling banners.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield wore a black Advance Auto Parts zip-up sweater and promoted the company on the airwaves. Michael Penix Jr., who led the University of Washington to last month's college football national championship game, marketed the pen company Sharpie.
As technology has changed, so has Radio Row, which the N.F.L. now also calls Media Row because it welcomes podcasters, television outlets and streaming platforms. The ESPN personality Pat McAfee hosted his daily show there this week. And the former Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton interviewed Shannon Sharpe, the ESPN sportscaster and Pro Football Hall of Fame tight end, on his podcast.
International participation has also increased. Shawne Merriman, a former linebacker, completed a spot with a media outlet from Ireland, which he said would not have happened when he played in the league more than a decade ago.
"When I see media, I just see opportunity, and this is the place to do it," Merriman said.
Sanders said he normally begins scouting for potential spots for Johnson midway through the N.F.L. season. They agreed to an hourlong segment with Bleacher Report, which does branded content with the online betting company DraftKings, because Johnson has worked with it before and enjoyed the relationship.
When Johnson entered the convention center, he hugged about 10 people before sitting on a couch, setting down his small coffee and fastening a headset and microphone.
As the conversation about Super Bowl prop bets devolved into banter, a producer argued that he could beat Johnson in a football video game. "We need to get him checked out," Johnson said.
Earlier in the week, Johnson had posted on the X platform that he was joining the Las Vegas Raiders as a coach. When Johnson ended his segment, he was greeted by an ESPN reporter who peppered him with questions as he walked to the bathroom. Johnson clarified that the claim was a joke.
As Johnson exited the building, he hugged Troy Vincent, a high-ranking N.F.L. executive, before entering a black S.U.V.
Companies began to enlist high-profile athletes to endorse their products as Radio Row expanded. It was a welcome change for the broadcasters, who previously had to scour lobbies and hallways in search of guests and then escort them to their tables. Now, the stars come to them.
A company with a prominent athlete as its spokesman will get attention on Radio Row, said Chris Russo, known as Mad Dog, a former WFAN host who now works for SiriusXM.
"He's going to be on a million stations," Russo said. "They're not sending the vice president -- we'd never put him on -- so having so many players available makes it valuable to be there."
In recent years, FanDuel, another online sports betting company, has used current and former athletes, including Rob Gronkowski, to highlight the expansion of its broadcast programming. On Thursday morning, the host Kay Adams completed a segment with not-so-subtly-placed Smirnoff vodka products in the shot.
But the advertising also goes beyond sports.
Solomon Wilcots, a former N.F.L. player who is now a SiriusXM host, recalls conducting a segment in 2010 with the comedians Chris Rock, Kevin James and Adam Sandler, who were promoting their upcoming movie "Grown Ups" ahead of Super Bowl XLIV in Miami.
The boxer Floyd Mayweather, whom Wilcots was scheduled to interview next separately, joined the three actors and it evolved into a lively conversation. The comedians teased Mayweather because he had not yet agreed to a highly anticipated fight against Manny Pacquiao.
"The N.F.L. is a business, and they help other companies with their business by sharing these platforms," Wilcots said. "I think it is a phenomenal quid pro quo."
Johnson is capitalizing on the business of the Super Bowl beyond Radio Row as well.
He has filmed a commercial with the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority and will do a marketing appearance for Electronic Arts, the company that makes the Madden video games.
His week's schedule also includes appearing on the ESPN morning debate show "First Take" and filming an episode of "Nightcap," his popular podcast with Sharpe.
"It's fun, and with all the opportunities bestowed upon me, I really wanted to be here and show face," Johnson said.

Full text: On-field success and a certain off-field relationship helped make Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and Andy Reid ubiquitous on TV commercials during the N.F.L. season.
The Kansas City Chiefs enter Sunday's Super Bowl having already won -- when it comes to commercials.
Over the past year, the star players Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, along with Coach Andy Reid, have been inescapable to TV viewers. Flipping channels, you might find Mr. Kelce baring his arm for a Pfizer Covid-19 shot, Mr. Mahomes hollering in support of a State Farm promotion or Mr. Reid coveting some chicken "nuggies."
During this National Football League season, companies featured Mr. Mahomes in 19 ad spots, Mr. Kelce in 10 and Mr. Reid in four. The estimated amount spent to air the ads on television was $ 178 million for Mr. Mahomes, $ 120 million for Mr. Kelce and $ 69 million for Mr. Reid, according to iSpot.tv, an ad measurement company. Those are the highest numbers for any sports figures. Because there were several commercials in which at least two of the three appeared, the dollar totals have some overlap.
"Brands invested to make the Chiefs-themed ads hard to miss," said Cassandra Arora, the chief marketing officer of iSpot, which estimates the spend of an ad based on the market rate for how much companies have to pay to air commercials on TV. Basically, the more spend an ad has, the more viewers are seeing it.
By comparison, Deion Sanders, the former N.F.L. star who coaches the University of Colorado's football team, and Nick Saban, the recently retired University of Alabama football coach, each appeared in ads worth around $ 20 million during the same period. Christian McCaffrey, the San Francisco running back, appeared in ads with a spend of $ 46 million, while the 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy appeared in one ad -- for Toyota -- worth just $ 67,000.
A few factors explain the marketing blitz for the three Chiefs: consistent success, the marketing budgets of insurance companies and, of course, Taylor Swift.
Companies capitalized on Mr. Mahomes's prodigious talent starting after his second season in 2018, in which he threw for 50 touchdowns. He flaunted his hair in an ad for Head and Shoulders; stood alongside Aaron Rodgers, then a quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, in a State Farm commercial; and promoted Amazon Web Services' sleek football analytics. In 2022, after he had won a Super Bowl and a Most Valuable Player Award, the ad spend on the 21 commercials featuring Mr. Mahomes was $ 164 million, more than those featuring the basketball stars LeBron James and Stephen Curry combined.
Mr. Kelce appeared in a few lower-profile commercials, and Mr. Reid occasionally joined Mr. Mahomes in ad spots. But a second Super Bowl victory last year and a celebrity relationship changed things immensely, particularly for Mr. Kelce.
Since the start of the 2023 N.F.L. season, around when Mr. Kelce started his high-profile relationship with Ms. Swift, the global music superstar, the Chiefs have reached a new level of ubiquity. Thanks in large part to Ms. Swift's appearances at Kansas City games, more women are watching the N.F.L. -- and specifically the Chiefs, said Kim Whitler, a professor of business administration at the University of Virginia's business school.
"There's incredible new interest in these players, and part of this is they're bringing in this new group of people who were never interested in the N.F.L.," Ms. Whitler said.
Their commercial appearances jumped accordingly. Mr. Reid appeared in four commercials in the 2023 season, up from just one the season before. Mr. Kelce made the same number of ads that he did in 2022 -- six -- but his spending jump, to $ 120 million from $ 895,000, was the biggest. (It is unclear whether any of the three will be featured in a Super Bowl ad this year.)
They were compensated handsomely. Mr. Mahomes makes roughly $ 20 million from his endorsement deals, according to Forbes, on top of the more than $ 50 million paid to him annually by the Chiefs. Mr. Kelce takes in a reported $ 5 million from his deals, in addition to the roughly $ 14 million per year he is paid to play football. It is not known how much Mr. Reid makes from his commercial appearances, though his annual coaching salary is estimated to be at least $ 10 million.
The spots were diverse. In addition to his Pfizer spot, Mr. Kelce appeared in ads for Campbell's Soup, Subway, State Farm, Lowe's and the credit reporting company Experian.
Mr. Kelce's star was well established in football and growing outside it, spurred on by that second Super Bowl victory last February and his hosting of "Saturday Night Live" the next month. Companies already had Mr. Kelce on their shortlist of celebrities who could drive engagement for their brands, said Jason Damata, a media consultant. But after he started dating Ms. Swift, Mr. Kelce jumped the line.
"When he hit the zeitgeist, they were poised to focus their investment and reap the cultural and business rewards," Mr. Damata said of companies teaming up with Mr. Kelce.
The investment in the Chiefs started in 2019 with Mr. Mahomes joining Mr. Rodgers, a longtime State Farm pitchman. Large insurance companies like State Farm, GEICO and Progressive collectively spend billions of dollars annually on advertising. In 2022, State Farm spent $ 125 million, or more than two-thirds of its estimated ad spend during the N.F.L. season, on commercials featuring Kansas City players; this season, State Farm has poured in $ 130 million, or slightly more than 70 percent of its spend during the season.
Linda Lee, the chief marketing officer of the meals and beverages division at Campbell's, said her company had begun to think about working with Mr. Kelce after last year's Super Bowl, in which he faced off against his brother Jason and the Philadelphia Eagles.
But she couldn't have predicted that making an ad featuring the Kelce brothers, along with their mother, before the 2023 season would be followed by such a meteoric rise in fame for Travis. Since releasing the ad, Ms. Lee said, the company has garnered four times the ordinary engagement on TikTok with its Chunky products.
"There was a little good fortune in the selection of this family," Ms. Lee said.

Toyota Delays 10 Models After Flawed Engine Tests
Toyota Motor said it had halted the global shipments of 10 vehicles after it discovered that an affiliate had mishandled the testing of diesel engines used in the automobiles, the latest embarrassing problem to hit the world's biggest automaker in recent months.
The Toyota affiliate used software to measure horsepower output that made "values appear smoother with less variation," Toyota, the parent company, said in a statement on Monday. The vehicles "meet engine output standards," and there is no need to stop using the engines or vehicles, the company said.
Still, Toyota decided to stop shipping the 10 models that use three diesel engines at issue. Among the models that will temporarily be shut down are the Hilux pickup and the Land Cruiser 300 sport utility. Toyota did not say how many vehicles were affected.
Japan's transportation ministry said in a statement that it had ordered Toyota Industries to address its mismanagement of the engine testing, adding that it would conduct inspections and issue penalties.
"Fraud is an act that undermines user confidence and shakes the very foundation of the automobile certification system," the ministry said.
Koichi Ito, the chief executive of Toyota Industries, apologized for the mishaps. "We are extremely sorry that this was caused by Toyota Industries Corporation," he said. Hisako Ueno and Andrés R. Martínez

No Recalls After Inquiry Into Dodge and Ram
U.S. auto safety regulators will not seek a recall after a seven-year investigation into complaints alleging that Dodge and Ram vehicles can roll away after being shifted into park.
The problem was similar to one blamed in the death of Star Trek actor Anton Yelchin, although the company was in the process of recalling his 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee to address the issue.
The investigation, opened in December of 2016, covered almost 1.3 million Ram 1500 pickup trucks from the 2013 to 2017 model years, as well as Dodge Durango SUVs from 2014 through 2017.
At issue were electronic dial-like rotary gear selector knobs that were new at the time and different from previous mechanical shifters that used a lever to select gears. The knobs are turned to the left or right and have detents that click into gear.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says in documents posted on its website Monday that it and Stellantis, formerly Fiat Chrysler, had received nearly 1,500 complaints that the vehicles would roll after drivers put them in park.
But the agency said it did not find evidence that a design or manufacturing defect caused the rollaway incidents. Plus, Fiat Chrysler did a "customer satisfaction campaign" to update software so the vehicles automatically shift into park if the driver's door is opened.
The agency said it monitored vehicles that got the update and found that the campaign was "effective in reducing the frequency of vehicle rollaway incidents in the subject vehicles."
In a statement, Stellantis said it was "pleased that our update appears to have resonated with customers." ASSOCIATED PRESS

Japan Sees Market Rise, But China's Is Stumbling: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A change in perception among investors about China and Japan is one of the biggest themes in the markets right now.
There's a shift underway in Asia that's reverberating through global financial markets.
Japan's stock market, overlooked by investors for decades, is making a furious comeback. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index is edging closer to the record it set on Dec. 29, 1989, which effectively marked the peak of Japan's economic ascendancy before a collapse that led to decades of low growth.
China, long an impossible-to-ignore market, has been spiraling downward. Stocks in China recently touched lows not seen since a rout in 2015, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was the worst-performing major market in the world last year. Stocks stemmed their slide only when Beijing recently signaled its intention to intervene but remain far below previous highs.
This year was set to be a tumultuous one for global markets, with unpredictable swings as economic fortunes diverge and voters in more than 50 countries go to the polls. But there's one unforeseen reversal already underway: a change in perception among investors about China and Japan.
Seizing on this shift, Japan's prime minister, Fumio Kishida, addressed more than 3,000 global financiers gathered in Hong Kong this week for a conference sponsored by Goldman Sachs. It was the first time a Japanese prime minister had given a keynote address at the event.
"Now Japan has a golden opportunity to completely overcome low economic growth and a deflationary environment that have persisted for a quarter of a century," Mr. Kishida said in a video recording. His government, he said, would "demonstrate to all of you Japan's transition to a new economic stage by mobilizing all the policy tools."
It's the kind of message that Japan has been honing for a decade, and now investors want to hear more of it. Foreign investors pumped $ 2.6 billion into the Japanese stock market last week, adding to $ 6.5 billion the week before, according to data from Japan Exchange Group. That is a stark shift from the roughly $ 3.6 billion that was yanked out in December.
All that money has sent Tokyo's Nikkei 225 surging about 8 percent this month. The market is up over 30 percent over the past 12 months. This week, Toyota rose to a record market value for a Japanese company, about $ 330 billion, surpassing the mark set in 1987 by the telecom conglomerate NTT.
A combination of factors has contributed to Japan's recent success. A weak yen has made stocks look cheap to foreign investors, and it has been a boon to exporters and multinationals based in Japan that make their profits overseas. Important reforms to the corporate sector have given shareholders more rights, enabling them to call for changes in strategy and management. Unlike inflation in other parts of the world, rising inflation in Japan has been a sign that things are headed in the right direction, after decades of falling prices and sluggish economic growth dampened appetite among consumers and companies to spend.
And there is one additional factor: geopolitics. The longer-term prospects for Japan, the third-largest economy, are looking good when parts of the world are souring on the second-largest economy, China.
"One of the best things to happen to Japan is China," said Seth Fischer, the founder and chief investment officer at Oasis Management, a hedge fund based in Hong Kong.
"Japan has for 10 years been working on creating a more productive corporate environment and a better place to be an equity investor through consistently trying to improve value," Mr. Fischer said. "People don't believe the same about China."
In a recent survey of global fund managers by Bank of America, selling Chinese stocks and buying Japanese stocks were two of the three most popular trade ideas. (The other was to load up on high-flying U.S. tech stocks.)
China's ruling Communist Party has sought to insert itself into the business sector in recent years, leaving investors worried that politics often trumps the bottom line for many of China's corporate titans. The blurring of politics and business has also raised concerns in Washington and in European capitals, leading to regulations that have prevented foreign investments into certain sectors and companies.
China has not struggled for economic growth like Japan, but a protracted property market collapse has shredded consumer and investor confidence. Lingering issues with China's economy have exacerbated weakness in the country's currency, the yuan.
Much of the negative sentiment has played out in Hong Kong, an open market where global investors traditionally place their bets on China and its companies. The market was pummeled last year, and it slipped further over the first three weeks of this year.
Beijing intervened this week to try to reverse the sell-off. On Monday, the country's No. 2 official, Premier Li Qiang, called on the authorities to be more "forceful" and take more measures to "improve market confidence." His speech lifted stocks, as did a report from Bloomberg, citing unnamed officials, that the authorities were contemplating a $ 278 billion market rescue.
Then on Wednesday, the central bank, the People's Bank of China, freed commercial banks to do more lending, essentially pumping $ 139 billion into the market by lowering the amount of money banks are required to keep in reserve. Regulators also loosened rules for how indebted property developers could pay back loans.
The words and actions propelled the market higher this week, with the Hang Seng Index posting three of its best days this year. China's Shanghai and Shenzhen markets also bounced, though not by as much.
But many investors say the measures have failed to address a much bigger problem: China's economic trajectory. They remain disappointed with China's response to its broader economic slump and its perceived reluctance to pull off a showstopping stimulus, as it did in previous periods of economic stress.
The Hang Seng Index fell 1.6 percent on Friday, reversing some of the week's gain.
"We hope it will still happen," said Daniel Morris, an analyst at BNP Paribas, referring to a more substantial effort to prop up markets. "But we don't have confidence that it will. I honestly would have thought that at the end of last year all the bad news had to be priced in, and yet we have fallen further again this year."
Economists, financiers and corporate executives around the world looked to China last year for an economic rebound after its government scrapped its "zero Covid" policy, punishing lockdowns that at times put the country into an economic freeze. But Chinese consumers didn't participate in the kind of "revenge spending" seen elsewhere after reopenings, and a property crisis has weighed on families, many of whom have nearly three-quarters of their savings tied up in real estate.
"There is not much confidence domestically, and then you have a government that isn't very interested in supporting the economy," said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at S&P Global Ratings. "Markets somehow had expected much more and are becoming increasingly disappointed and disillusioned."
And the ranks of the disillusioned include some Chinese investors, who have been moving money into exchange-traded funds that track Japanese stocks. At times these funds' prices have traded far above the value of their underlying assets, a sign of investors' enthusiasm.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Automakers like Ford, Kia and Toyota are offering more hybrid options to appeal to buyers who aren't ready for fully electric vehicles.
As Teslas and other electric vehicles dazzled car buyers with futuristic technology and dreams of a gasoline-free future, hybrid cars began to seem like yesterday's news. Sales of the Toyota Prius, the standard-bearer for hybrids, fell 85 percent over a decade.
Now, a slowdown in the growth of electric car sales has led General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen to walk back ambitious targets for those vehicles. And sales of hybrids are robust, underscoring what may be the enduring reality check of 2023: Many Americans are hugely receptive to electrification, but they're not ready for a fully electric car.
"Consumers want the same experience they've had" with a combustion engine car, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive. "And we are not there yet. Price is still the top barrier for most consumers."
Americans bought a record 1.2 million electric vehicles last year, a gain of about 46 percent and a 7.6 percent share of all new car sales, according to Cox. But hybrid sales rose even faster, up 65 percent to more than 1.2 million, lifting their market share to 8 percent from 5.5 percent, according to Edmunds. Throw in plug-in hybrids, and nearly one in 10 new cars pairs a gasoline engine with electric motors to save fuel and boost performance.
Analysts say stubbornly high electric car prices and worries about public charging are pushing some car shoppers to hybrids, including renters or urbanites who can't charge a battery-powered car at home. Hybrids deliver savings at the pump with no need to plug in for hours or plan trips around charging stops. Their batteries are much smaller and cost a lot less than the batteries in fully electric vehicles.
Buyers paid about $ 42,500 on average for hybrids in November, according to Edmunds, compared with $ 60,500 for electric vehicles and $ 47,500 for a conventional models. There is a smorgasbord of affordable hybrid models, many starting around $ 30,000 -- including a stylishly redesigned Prius that returns a model-record 57 miles per gallon. The electric vehicle market, by contrast, remains top-heavy with luxury offerings.
Jim Farley, Ford's chief executive, said mainstream consumers were fundamentally different from early adopters who flocked to electric vehicles with little encouragement or education from automakers.
"E.V.s continue to grow with spectacular numbers, but what's changing is that people buying them are not willing to pay a premium," Mr. Farley said in an interview. "Now we have to get costs under control and even -- surprise, surprise -- advertise."
Ford is trimming its planned production of the F-150 Lightning pickup truck and increasing output of the more-affordable F-150 Hybrid by 20 percent. The automaker plans to quadruple overall hybrid production in hopes of selling 100,000 this year. They include the red-hot Maverick compact pickup, whose 37-m.p.g. hybrid version has exceeded Ford's most optimistic sales forecasts.
So why doesn't Ford make all Mavericks hybrids? Mr. Farley said the company remained committed to offering a full range of powertrains, including electrified trucks that can double as mobile generators to power equipment, homes or even the electrical grid. Securing battery supplies also takes a long time, Mr. Farley said, sometimes longer than building a new assembly line.
"We didn't know a $ 30,000 truck would be this popular," he said of the Maverick. "Ford has struggled to make money on small cars since the beginning of time."
The hybrid resurgence is mainly benefiting Toyota, Honda and Hyundai Motor, including its Kia sister brand.
Those automakers account for roughly 90 percent of U.S. hybrid sales, followed by Ford. All continue to invest in the technology even as G.M., Volkswagen and other automakers vow to pivot entirely to electric vehicles.
Honda outdid itself in 2023, nearly tripling hybrid sales to 294,000 units. Hybrid versions of the Honda Accord sedan and the CR-V sport utility vehicle now account for more than half those models' sales. That Accord combines luxury-level comfort, quality and amenities with up to 44 m.p.g. in overall driving, for $ 33,290 to start.
En route to record U.S. sales in 2023, Hyundai, Kia and their Genesis luxury brand together sold more electric vehicles in the United States than any automaker save Tesla. Yet Hyundai Motor remains bullish on hybrids, even after the Biden administration proposed regulations that would require two-thirds of new cars to be fully electric by 2032.
"Anyone who wants to survive in this business is making these electric investments," said Steve Center, chief operating officer at Kia America. That includes Hyundai, which has committed to investing $ 12 billion in factories in Alabama and Georgia.
But Mr. Center added that an electric vehicle might not serve the needs of a "cowboy in Montana with a pickup truck." Hybrids can help reduce emissions from those kinds of vehicles faster, he said.
Mr. Center offered a bold prediction: As combustion engine cars fade into obsolescence, all remaining gasoline models will adopt electrification in hybrid form. Gasoline cars won't be able to compete without it, as consumers and regulators alike demand better fuel economy and reduced emissions.
"Everything should be hybrid to start with, because everyone can drive a hybrid, everywhere," he said.
Toyota, the world's largest automaker, seems to be treading that path. Within a few months, Toyota will offer nine hybrid-only models, including one from its Lexus luxury brand. The company sold more than 640,000 hybrids in America last year, 29 percent of its total U.S. sales; it sold about 15,000 fully electric vehicles.
David Christ, general manager of Toyota's North American division, said the automaker expects to crack 40 percent electrified sales in 2024. He echoed Mr. Center's view on the prospects for combustion engine cars.
"Over time, we're not opposed to going all-hybrid to make a faster step to a greener future," Mr. Christ said.
Toyota's faith in democratizing hybrid technology turned the company, once an environmental darling, into a whipping boy as it was widely accused of foot-dragging over electric vehicles. If Toyota is feeling vindicated, Mr. Christ won't admit it.
"A year ago, we were getting roasted in the media for not being an E.V. believer," he said. "We thought that was unfair, that we weren't in on electrification. We started it. We have eight million hybrids on the road today, and every one reduces greenhouse gas emissions."
But Mr. Christ added that the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles was not yet ready for many millions of battery-powered cars, which is why sales of such vehicles have slowed.
"At the end of the day, the consumer drives this industry, not the manufacturer," he said.
Toyota will plant its biggest flag yet in June. The redesigned 2025 Camry will be offered only as a hybrid. That may seem to be a major gamble for the nation's perennially best-selling sedan. Toyota sold about 290,000 Camrys last year, and just 35,000 were hybrids. If the new Camry can maintain its sales, Toyota will convert a few hundred thousand buyers to a roughly 50-m.p.g. hybrid in one swoop. If not, the Camry franchise will take a huge hit.
Yet Toyota isn't taking a shot in the dark. When Toyota switched the Sienna to an all-hybrid lineup for the 2021 model year, it immediately became America's best-selling minivan, up from fourth place.
But some auto experts said hybrids could do only so much.
Dave Cooke, senior vehicles analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said hybrids were a critical, affordable tool that allowed millions of drivers to use less gasoline but remained a transition technology. Long-term climate change goals still demand a shift to electric vehicles powered by a renewable energy grid, he said.
"In our comments to the E.P.A. and industry, it's 'Hey, put a hybrid on everything,"' Mr. Cooke said, referring to the Environmental Protection Agency. "But we still need stricter standards to ensure automakers face rules on what's technologically achievable."
Mr. Cooke noted that the fuel economy of the nation's fleet had held flat for years, in part because of the shift to pickups and S.U.V.s. Recent gains are entirely attributable to the rise of electric vehicles, with hybrids playing a negligible role.
Chris Harto, transportation and energy policy analyst for Consumer Reports, agreed with that assessment. "Hybrids buy some time, but E.V.s are where we need to go" to achieve climate goals, he said.
Yet Mr. Harto bemoans the popular narrative that pits hybrids and electric vehicles against each other.
"They're both taking market share from less efficient I.C.E. vehicles," Mr. Harto said, referring to internal combustion engines. "And there's a lot of market share to take."

Musk Says No to A.I. Work Without Bigger Tesla Stake: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Elon Musk, the electric car company's chief executive, said he would "build products outside of Tesla" unless the board raises his stake to 25 percent.
Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, stunned investors by demanding that the company's board give him shares worth more than $ 80 billion if it wants him to continue developing products based on artificial intelligence.
In the latest demonstration of his disregard for conventional ways of communicating with investors, Mr. Musk said late Monday on X, the social media site he owns, that he needed to own 25 percent of Tesla to avoid takeovers and have enough control of the company as it develops robots and other artificial intelligence technology.
If his demands are not met, Mr. Musk said, he would pursue unspecified ventures outside of Tesla. In addition to electric cars, Tesla has been developing a humanoid robot called Optimus, and uses artificial intelligence to develop self-driving technology, a cornerstone of the company's strategy. Those businesses belong to Tesla, and Mr. Musk could not simply walk away with them.
The company's stock market valuation of almost $ 700 billion -- more than twice as much as Toyota Motor, the world's largest automaker by annual car sales -- is predicated in part on investors' belief that the company will lead the rest of the industry in developing cars that can drive from place to place without human intervention. Investors are also betting that advanced automation will allow Tesla to manufacture cars much more efficiently and profitably than rivals.
Mr. Musk owns 13 percent of Tesla after selling a substantial portion of his stake to finance his $ 44 billion acquisition of Twitter, which he renamed X. The social media site has struggled under his leadership and has plunged in value. An additional 12 percent of Tesla would be worth $ 83 billion at the current share price, effectively recouping Mr. Musk's investment in Twitter -- which he has said he regrets -- and then some.
"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in A.I. & robotics without having ~25% voting control," Mr. Musk wrote on X. "Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can't be overturned."
He went on: "Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla." But he also said the board would take no action until a Delaware judge ruled in a lawsuit brought by a Tesla shareholder challenging an earlier compensation plan that was instrumental in making Mr. Musk the richest person in the world.
Mr. Musk testified in the Delaware case in late 2022. Gregory Varallo, who represents shareholders in the lawsuit, said he did not know when there would be a ruling. No documents have been filed in the case since July.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
The demand by Mr. Musk underlined the extent to which Tesla, which sold 1.8 million vehicles last year, is subject to his impulses.
"You're never really sure what you're going to read from Elon Musk when you get back to the office after a three-day weekend," said Ben Rose, president of Battle Road Research, which advises institutional investors. Mr. Rose called Mr. Musk's demand "curious and ill-timed," considering that Tesla faces increasing competition and difficult economic conditions.
Tesla's success under Mr. Musk forced traditional carmakers to begin offering electric vehicles, which are essential in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. But Mr. Musk's behavior and statements have weighed on the share price and gotten him into trouble with regulators.
Tesla shares fell when Mr. Musk sold some of his stake to buy Twitter. The shares also suffered after Mr. Musk said in 2018 that he had the money to take Tesla private and delist it from the stock exchange. Mr. Musk was unable to execute the plan. The going-private statement led to a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which Tesla settled for $ 40 million while agreeing that lawyers would screen what Mr. Musk's says on Twitter. It was not clear whether Mr. Musk's statement on X late Monday had been approved by lawyers.
It would be difficult for Tesla's board, which has been criticized for not doing enough to control Mr. Musk, to grant his wish immediately or unconditionally. The company would have to issue new shares, Mr. Rose of Battle Research said. That would dilute the value of existing shares without raising additional capital for Tesla, and might spawn shareholder lawsuits.
But Mr. Rose added that the board could assign Mr. Musk stock options that he would receive only if he achieves certain milestones over five years or more. That would be similar to a compensation package Mr. Musk received in 2018 that depended on Tesla reaching stock market valuations seen at the time as unrealistically ambitious. Mr. Musk became the world's richest man by defying expectations and hitting the targets.
The company's stock has fallen about 11 percent so far this year but is up about 70 percent over the last 12 months.
Mr. Musk did not specify which products he might develop outside the company. He has already started a separate artificial intelligence business called X.AI, which last year released the Grok chatbot to selected users even though he has also highlighted the hazards of the technology in public comments.
Tesla's main use of artificial intelligence has come in its Autopilot and Full Self Driving systems, which assist drivers by taking over certain tasks in certain driving situations. Mr. Musk has said several times over the years that the company was close to perfecting the technology that would allow a car to drive itself completely. But self-driving technology has taken longer to perfect than Mr. Musk's predictions, and many experts believe it is still years away.
The carmaker has also been working on a robot it calls Optimus. The device can fold a shirt, according to a video posted on X by Tesla on Monday, but has not become a significant source of revenue.
On X, some of Mr. Musk's fans applauded his demand for a 25 percent stake, saying he earned the money. But others said it was his own fault his stake in the company has fallen. "They didn't make you sell your shares," one user wrote, adding, "why should the board do anything to rectify this for you?"
A stake of less than 15 percent of the company, Mr. Musk said, "makes a takeover by dubious interests too easy."

Guatemala’s New President Is Sworn In, Despite Efforts to Stop Him

GUATEMALA CITY — Despite staunch resistance from his opponents in the government, anti-corruption crusader Bernardo Arévalo was inaugurated early Monday morning as Guatemala’s president, a turning point in a country where tensions have been simmering over widespread graft and impunity.
His inauguration had been scheduled for Sunday, but members of Congress delayed it, and concerns persisted about whether it would happen at all. But after an international outcry and pressure from protesters, Arévalo was sworn in shortly after midnight, becoming Guatemala’s most progressive head of state since democracy was reestablished in the 1980s.
His rise to power — six months after his victory at the polls delivered a stunning rebuke to Guatemala’s conservative political establishment — amounts to a sea change in Central America’s most populous country. His landslide election reflected broad support for his proposals to curb graft and revive a teetering democracy.
But as Arévalo prepares to govern, he must assert control while facing off against an alliance of conservative prosecutors, members of Congress and other political figures who have gutted Guatemala’s governing institutions in recent years.
“Arévalo has the most thankless job in Guatemala today because he arrives with exceptionally high expectations,” said Edgar Ortíz Romero, an expert on Guatemalan constitutional law. “He’s been given a budget for a Toyota when people want a Ferrari.”
Arévalo’s opponents in Congress moved to rein him in late last year, approving a budget that would severely limit his ability to spend on health care and education, two of his top priorities.
But finding resources to spend is just one of the difficulties confronting Arévalo. More urgently, as his opponents in Congress showed again Sunday, he faces multiple challenges from Guatemala’s entrenched establishment, aimed at quickly crippling his ability to govern.
The power struggle playing out in Guatemala, a nation of 18 million, is being closely followed throughout Central America, a region on edge over the expanding sway of drug cartels, the exodus of migrants and the use of authoritarian tactics in neighboring countries like El Salvador and Nicaragua.
“This is a unique event in the country’s history,” said Javier García, a 31-year-old engineer, who was among the thousands who turned out to celebrate the inauguration in the capital, Guatemala City. “Now I hope those who lost the election understand this once and for all.”
The transition of power was anything but orderly. After he burst onto Guatemala’s political scene last year, Arévalo faced an assassination plot, his party’s suspension and a barrage of legal attacks aimed at preventing him from taking office. His opponent in the presidential race, a former first lady, refused to recognize his victory.
In the capital, speculation swirled in recent days that prosecutors would seek the arrest of Arévalo’s running mate, Karin Herrera, potentially derailing the inauguration because both the president-elect and vice president-elect need to be present for the transfer of power to be legitimate.
Guatemala’s highest court issued an order last week shielding Herrera from arrest, giving her and Arévalo a reprieve. But the same court sowed confusion Sunday when it allowed his conservative opponents to remain in the running to retain control of Congress.
Members of Congress opposed to Arévalo then spent hours trying to consolidate their hold on the chamber, effectively delaying the transfer of power as much of the country remained on tenterhooks. But in a twist Sunday night, Arévalo’s party managed to win leadership of Congress, clearing the way for the swearing-in.
Prosecutors and judges opposed to Arévalo had already gone on a judicial onslaught soon after the national election. Seeking to cast doubt on Arévalo’s victory at the polls, where he won by more than 20 percentage points, prosecutors obtained arrest warrants for four magistrates who served on Guatemala’s top electoral authority, alleging corruption in the acquisition of election software. The four magistrates were all outside the country when the warrants were issued.
On Thursday, the attorney general’s office arrested Napoleón Barrientos, a former interior minister, on the grounds that he had refused to use force to maintain order in October against protesters demanding the attorney general’s resignation.
Such moves have grown common in Guatemala since 2019, when conservative political figures shut down a pioneering United Nations-backed anti-corruption mission. Dozens of prosecutors and judges who had been trying to take on graft fled into exile.
Pushing back, the United States, the European Union and multiple leaders in Latin America threw their support behind Arévalo, a sociologist and former diplomat. That support was visible Sunday as the delays seemed to put the transfer of power in doubt.
“There is no question that Bernardo Arévalo is the president of Guatemala,” said Samantha Power, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, who led a U.S. delegation to the inauguration. She added, “The world is watching.”
The Biden administration maneuvered for months in support of Arévalo after he shocked many in Guatemala, including members of his party, by squeaking into a runoff election that he went on to resoundingly win.
Washington’s support for reform stands in contrast to the role it played in Guatemala decades ago. The United States backed the Guatemalan military during a long, brutal civil war; one military dictator during the 1980s was later convicted of genocide for trying to exterminate the Ixil, a Mayan Indian people. In 1954, the CIA engineered a coup that toppled a popular, democratically elected president, Jacobo Arbenz.
After that coup, Arévalo’s father, Juan José Arévalo, a former president who is still admired in Guatemala for allowing freedom of speech and creating the social security system, spent years in exile around Latin America.
The younger Arévalo, a soft-spoken sociologist and diplomat, was born in Uruguay during that time and was raised in Venezuela, Mexico and Chile before the family could return to Guatemala.
As efforts intensified last month to prevent Arévalo from taking office, the United States imposed sanctions on Miguel Martínez, one of the closest allies of the departing president, Alejandro Giammattei, over widespread bribery schemes.
And in a pivotal move, the U.S. authorities in December imposed visa restrictions on nearly 300 Guatemalans, including more than 100 members of Congress, accusing them of undermining democracy and the rule of law as they tried to weaken Arévalo and keep him from being inaugurated.
“The pressure from the United States has prevented a coup d’état; without that, we wouldn’t be here,” said Manfredo Marroquín, the head of Citizen Action, an anti-corruption policy group. “The Americans are like insurance: there in times of crisis.”
Still, the U.S. support of Arévalo has revealed fissures in Guatemala. In his last weeks in office, Giammattei, who was barred by law from seeking reelection, grew increasingly vocal in his criticism of the American sanctions and the international support for Arévalo.
Dealing another blow to Arévalo, Giammattei withdrew Guatemala from an anti-drug task force created in 2020 with the United States. That move could weaken Guatemala’s ability to combat drug trafficking groups, which have been expanding their sway around the country.
At the same time, Arévalo’s efforts to forge alliances have revealed how challenging it will be for him to govern. This month, he announced the first Guatemalan Cabinet in which women would account for half of all ministerial posts, but the celebration of that milestone was short-lived.
A member of a major business association was named to the new Cabinet, prompting calls that Arévalo, who has hewed to centrist policies, was drifting to the right. Another Cabinet nominee withdrew after old comments surfaced in which she criticized a prominent Indigenous activist.
Indignation also arose because only one minister in his Cabinet was Indigenous, despite the crucial role that Indigenous groups played in protesting against the efforts to keep Arévalo from taking office. Nearly half of Guatemala’s population is Indigenous.
“There is an expectation that this new government will be different,” said Sandra Xinico, an anthropologist and Indigenous activist. “But we’ve seen once again how Indigenous peoples are excluded from the political process.”

Full text: For hours, it was unclear whether Bernardo Arévalo, an anticorruption crusader, would take office at all, as lawmakers delayed the transfer of power.
Despite staunch resistance from his opponents in the government, the anticorruption crusader Bernardo Arévalo was inaugurated early Monday morning as Guatemala's president, a turning point in a country where tensions have been simmering over widespread graft and impunity.
His inauguration had been scheduled for Sunday, but members of Congress delayed it, and concerns persisted about whether it would happen at all. But after an international outcry and pressure from protesters, Mr. Arévalo was sworn in shortly after midnight, becoming Guatemala's most progressive head of state since democracy was re-established in the 1980s.
His rise to power -- six months after his victory at the polls delivered a stunning rebuke to Guatemala's conservative political establishment -- amounts to a sea change in Central America's most populous country. His landslide election reflected broad support for his proposals to curb graft and revive a teetering democracy.
But as Mr. Arévalo prepares to govern, he must assert control while facing off against an alliance of conservative prosecutors, members of Congress and other political figures who have gutted Guatemala's governing institutions in recent years.
"Arévalo has the most thankless job in Guatemala today because he arrives with exceptionally high expectations," said Edgar Ortíz Romero, an expert on Guatemalan constitutional law. "He's been given a budget for a Toyota when people want a Ferrari."
Mr. Arévalo's opponents in Congress moved to rein him in late last year, approving a budget that would severely limit his ability to spend on health care and education, two of his top priorities.
But finding resources to spend is just one of the difficulties confronting Mr. Arévalo. More urgently, as his opponents in Congress showed again on Sunday, he faces multiple challenges from Guatemala's entrenched establishment, aimed at quickly crippling his ability to govern.
The power struggle playing out in Guatemala, a nation of 18 million, is being closely followed throughout Central America, a region on edge over the expanding sway of drug cartels, the exodus of migrants and the use of authoritarian tactics in neighboring countries like El Salvador and Nicaragua.
"This is a unique event in the country's history," said Javier García, a 31-year-old engineer, who was among the thousands who turned out to celebrate the inauguration in the capital, Guatemala City. "Now I hope those who lost the election understand this once and for all."
The transition of power was anything but orderly. After he burst onto Guatemala's political scene last year, Mr. Arévalo faced an assassination plot, his party's suspension and a barrage of legal attacks aimed at preventing him from taking office. His opponent in the presidential race, a former first lady, refused to recognize his victory.
In the capital, speculation swirled in recent days that prosecutors would seek the arrest of Mr. Arévalo's running mate, Karin Herrera, potentially derailing the inauguration because both the president-elect and vice president-elect need to be present for the transfer of power to be legitimate.
Guatemala's highest court issued an order last week shielding Ms. Herrera from arrest, giving her and Mr. Arévalo a reprieve. But the same court sowed confusion on Sunday when it allowed his conservative opponents to remain in the running to retain control of Congress.
Members of Congress opposed to Mr. Arévalo then spent hours trying to consolidate their hold on the chamber, effectively delaying the transfer of power as much of the country remained on tenterhooks. But in a twist on Sunday night, Mr. Arévalo's party managed to win leadership of Congress, clearing the way for the swearing-in.
Prosecutors and judges opposed to Mr. Arévalo had already gone on a judicial onslaught soon after the national election. Seeking to cast doubt on Mr. Arévalo's victory at the polls, where he won by more than 20 percentage points, prosecutors obtained arrest warrants for four magistrates who served on Guatemala's top electoral authority, alleging corruption in the acquisition of election software. The four magistrates were all outside the country when the warrants were issued.
On Thursday, the attorney general's office arrested Napoleón Barrientos, a former interior minister, on the grounds that he had refused to use force to maintain order in October against protesters demanding the attorney general's resignation.
Such moves have grown common in Guatemala since 2019, when conservative political figures shut down a pioneering United Nations-backed anticorruption mission. Dozens of prosecutors and judges who had been trying to take on graft fled into exile.
Pushing back, the United States, the European Union and multiple leaders in Latin America threw their support behind Mr. Arévalo, a sociologist and former diplomat. That support was visible on Sunday as the delays seemed to put the transfer of power in doubt.
"There is no question that Bernardo Arévalo is the president of Guatemala," said Samantha Power, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, who led a U.S. delegation to the inauguration. She added, "The world is watching."
The Biden administration maneuvered for months in support of Mr. Arévalo after he shocked many in Guatemala, including members of his party, by squeaking into a runoff election that he went on to resoundingly win.
Washington's support for reform stands in contrast to the role it played in Guatemala decades ago. The United States backed the Guatemalan military during a long, brutal civil war; one military dictator during the 1980s was later convicted of genocide for trying to exterminate the Ixil, a Mayan Indian people. In 1954, the C.I.A. engineered a coup that toppled a popular, democratically elected president, Jacobo Arbenz.
After that coup, Mr. Arévalo's father, Juan José Arévalo, a former president who is still admired in Guatemala for allowing freedom of speech and creating the social security system, spent years in exile around Latin America.
The younger Mr. Arévalo, a soft-spoken sociologist and diplomat, was born in Uruguay during that time and was raised in Venezuela, Mexico and Chile before the family could return to Guatemala.
As efforts intensified last month to prevent Mr. Arévalo from taking office, the United States imposed sanctions on Miguel Martínez, one of the closest allies of the departing president, Alejandro Giammattei, over widespread bribery schemes.
And in a pivotal move, the American authorities in December imposed visa restrictions on nearly 300 Guatemalans, including more than 100 members of Congress, accusing them of undermining democracy and the rule of law as they tried to weaken Mr. Arévalo and keep him from being inaugurated.
"The pressure from the United States has prevented a coup d'état; without that, we wouldn't be here," said Manfredo Marroquín, the head of Citizen Action, an anticorruption policy group. "The Americans are like insurance: there in times of crisis."
Still, the U.S. support of Mr. Arévalo has revealed fissures in Guatemala. In his last weeks in office, Mr. Giammattei, who was barred by law from seeking re-election, grew increasingly vocal in his criticism of the American sanctions and the international support for Mr. Arévalo.
Dealing another blow to Mr. Arévalo, Mr. Giammattei withdrew Guatemala from an antidrug task force created in 2020 with the United States. That move could weaken Guatemala's ability to combat drug trafficking groups, which have been expanding their sway around the country.
At the same time, Mr. Arévalo's efforts to forge alliances have revealed how challenging it will be for him to govern. This month, he announced the first Guatemalan cabinet in which women would account for half of all ministerial posts, but the celebration of that milestone was short-lived.
A member of a major business association was named to the new cabinet, prompting calls that Mr. Arévalo, who has hewed to centrist policies, was drifting to the right. Another cabinet nominee withdrew after old comments surfaced in which she criticized a prominent Indigenous activist.
Indignation also arose because only one minister in his cabinet was Indigenous, despite the crucial role that Indigenous groups played in protesting against the efforts to keep Mr. Arévalo from taking office. Nearly half of Guatemala's population is Indigenous.
"There is an expectation that this new government will be different," said Sandra Xinico, an anthropologist and Indigenous activist. "But we've seen once again how Indigenous peoples are excluded from the political process."

Full text: And she's not exactly following the rules.
It was January 2015, and all anyone could talk about was Ebola, Boko Haram, and Charlie Hebdo. I was 23, and I didn't care about any of it. The world was ending? Of course the world was ending. My mom was gone. I was the one who sent her away.
For months, I had plotted against her -- with her siblings and friends, with professional interventionists -- until, while she sobbed and sobbed, I packed her suitcase. All I can say is: I was desperate. The woman I loved, in the doe-eyed way you can only ever love the one you imprint on, had been consumed by the parasitic brain worms of alcoholism. I was out of options.
Weeks passed. Her 30-day stay at the rehab facility in Minnesota turned into 60. Like a usurper, I left my small apartment in Manhattan and moved into her house -- my childhood home in suburban New Jersey, unrecognizable with disrepair.
I brought my boyfriend, my dog and my M.F.A. homework. I commuted to my secretarial job in Midtown on New Jersey Transit and drove my youngest sister to her extracurriculars. I acted like everything was normal, all the while wondering what I had done.
Around Christmas, my mother stopped responding to my emails. If I wanted to talk to her, to convince her and myself that I had done the right thing, I would have to track her down in person. So I boarded a plane to Minnesota for "the Family Program."
I met my middle sister, Emma, at the Hertz counter in the Minneapolis airport, where the clerk tacked on an underage fee for our Toyota Camry. At the Holiday Inn Express, we drank red wine out of paper cups on a queen bed. We didn't talk about Mom or how things would go in the morning. We wanted her to be healed; we worried she wouldn't be.
For weeks, we had been getting reports: She thinks she is special, different from the other patients. She thinks she doesn't need to be here.
The thing I knew was: She was special. Always had been. Gorgeous and generous and warm. Bawdy and mischievous and charismatic. She made friends wherever she went and believed -- against all evidence -- that I could do the same.
Her nurses and counselors were less than charmed. In their notes, they implied that she was manipulative, hostile, uncooperative.
I knew that side, too. But I had blown up our lives on the promise that we could get her back -- the real version -- and I wasn't willing to concede defeat until I saw her for myself.
The first day of the program, Emma and I left the hotel at 6 a.m. For four days, we wouldn't see the sun. It was dark as I scraped ice from the windshield each morning and dark as the steering wheel slipped through my gloved grip on our drives back.
The facility itself was a hospital-bright contrast to the northern darkness. On the first day, Emma and I wore name tags as we listened to testimony and watched videos about addiction. We waited to see our mom, but the patients never came.
When I asked after her on the second day, a counselor reminded me to "focus on myself." On the third day, I wanted to leave. I felt tricked by their brochures, so I turned myself into a platitude machine. When asked to name a higher power, I said something embarrassing about writing. A lie, dripping with treacle, that made everyone clap.
Toward the end of the last session, the patients appeared. Like reluctant guests on some disreputable talk show, they filed in behind a therapist, heads hanging. My mom wore pastel sweats and a full face of makeup. I hugged her thin frame. When she cried, her eyeliner ran.
"I lost 30 pounds," she said. She didn't think the loss was related to her enforced sobriety. "All discipline."
She got permission to take us on a tour. We started in the gift shop, where she tried to buy sweatshirts and tchotchkes, but I demurred, seeing only more dollar signs. From there, we walked to the cafeteria. I poured myself a bowl of cereal. My mom sprinkled undressed lettuce across her plate.
There was only one occupied table. Patients sat together, laughing and eating. I had met some of their family members, and I tried to match faces to stories: the professional swimmer, the prodigal son, the thieving aunt. The program seemed to be working for them.
We passed them without a word. One man -- tall, gray-haired -- offered my mom a pity nod before looking down at his plate. The rest carried on as if they couldn't see her. I felt the familiar sting of shame. I had been here before -- in seventh grade, at the far end of a lunch table -- but it was new for her.
I wanted to cheer her on, like she did for me when she seemed delusionally convinced I should run for student body president, because, well, who wouldn't vote for you? Instead, I kept my head down and followed her to the loser table.
It was too big for the three of us. My mom moved the lettuce around her plate, continuing her hunger strike. She talked about a sailing trip she was planning for the spring, as soon as she was reunited with her enabling boyfriend. In a low whisper she gossiped about the "druggies" and complained about her counselors. She lied about her benzo usage, broke patient confidentiality, lobbed passive-aggressive barbs. The weight of our failure was crushing.
She led us through a labyrinth of pink-carpeted hallways and underground tunnels, until we arrived at a single that looked like a cross between a dorm room and a hospital room.
"I got these for you," my mom said. She chucked a bag of Laffy Taffy at my sister.
I looked through the sliding glass door, but it was dark again. All I could see was my own stupid face. All I could see was the money and time we had spent, the things we had said that we could never unsay. All I could see was the ways I was like her.
Mom opened a bedside drawer. She retrieved a bag of carrots stored next to a Bible.
"I want to show you something."
She pulled the sliding glass door open. I followed her onto a balcony into the punishing cold. We were a few feet off the ground, overlooking a meadow. Packed snow covered the ground, pocked with hoof prints.
"Look," she said, pointing.
Standing at the forest line, like a mirage, were two fawns.
Deer were not exotic. There were so many in New Jersey that they had become a public nuisance. Still, I was mesmerized by the way they approached us -- slowly, deliberately.
Emma joined us on the balcony.
Where is their mother? I wondered. The fawns drew close enough that I could see their spots.
"You can feed them by hand," my mom said. "They're very trusting."
She tossed a handful of carrots, and her gentleness bent time, dilated it just wide enough that I could peer into the future. There, she stood beside me under the California sun, cradling one of my babies. Humbled, but upright. Taken apart and rebuilt, plank by plank.
Palm outstretched, she said: "If anything beautiful can come of this, write about it."

Carmakers Are Questioned About Tracking via Apps: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Federal Communications Commission is concerned about abusive partners using connected car apps to harass and track their victims.
Many modern cars are internet-connected and have apps that allow an owner to see a car's location, turn it on remotely, honk its horn and even adjust the temperature. These apps for car control and tracking are designed for convenience, but a New York Times article last month detailed how they have been weaponized in abusive relationships, allowing for unwanted stalking and harassment.
Domestic violence survivors and experts said car companies had not been responsive when asked to cut off abusers' digital access to cars. Customer service agents at the car companies were unable to help when the abuser was the owner or co-owner of the vehicle, even when the victim had a restraining order or a legal judgment awarding her sole use of the car during divorce proceedings.
On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission sent letters to nine of the largest automakers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford Motor and Tesla, asking for more information about their connected car apps and whether the companies had processes in place to assist abuse victims.
"No survivor of domestic violence and abuse should have to choose between giving up their car and allowing themselves to be stalked and harmed by those who can access its data and connectivity," Jessica Rosenworcel, the F.C.C. chairwoman, said in a statement. "We must do everything we can to help survivors stay safe. We need to work with auto and wireless industry leaders to find solutions."
Chairwoman Rosenworcel wrote in the letters that the F.C.C. was responsible for enforcing the Safe Connections Act, a relatively new law that requires phone companies to separate a victim's phone from a family plan shared with an abuser. To the extent that cars have become "smartphones on wheels," automakers "may be 'covered providers"' under the act, she wrote.
The agency also sent letters to the three largest wireless communications providers -- Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile -- about the role they play in providing connectivity to cars and whether they are complying with the law.
Thomas Kadri, a law professor at the University of Georgia who was an adviser on the Safe Connections Act, found it surprising that the law might apply to car manufacturers. But he said he hoped the letters would cause automakers to consider how connected car apps might be used for stalking and harassment.
"It's not a niche or rare issue at the scale they are operating at," he said.
The F.C.C. asked for responses to the letters by the end of the month.

U.S. Auto Sales Expected To Slow After Strong 2023: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Automakers sold more cars in 2023 than a year ago as supply chain chaos ended, but sales are now under pressure from higher interest rates.
After enjoying a strong rebound in sales in 2023, the auto industry appears headed for slower growth this year as consumers struggle with elevated interest rates and high prices for new cars and light trucks.
Edmunds, a market researcher, expects the industry to sell 15.7 million vehicles this year. That would amount to a modest increase from the 15.5 million sold last year, when sales jumped 12 percent.
"There's definitely pent-up demand out there, because people have been holding off purchases for a while," said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds. "But given the credit situation, we don't think the industry will see a ton of growth this year."
Since the coronavirus pandemic, automakers have struggled with shortages of critical parts that have prevented them from producing as many vehicles as consumers wanted to buy. In 2023, the shortages, especially for computer chips, finally eased, allowing production to return to more normal levels.
But over the past year, the Federal Reserve has significantly raised interest rates, which has pushed up costs considerably for car buyers.
For years, many people took advantage of zero-percent loans to buy vehicles, even as prices climbed. But such deals, offered by automakers to move inventory, have nearly disappeared in the wake of the Fed's rate hikes. In the fourth quarter of 2023, new-vehicle sales with zero-percent financing accounted for just 2.3 percent of all sales, according to Edmunds.
Monthly payments are at near-record highs. In the fourth quarter, the average monthly payment on new cars was $ 739, up from $ 717 in the same period a year ago.
Several automakers were hoping that a rapid rise in sales of new electric vehicles would drive the industry to gains into 2024 and 2025, but those cars and trucks haven't taken off quite as quickly as many analysts and executives had hoped.
In 2023, sales of battery-powered models in the United States topped one million vehicles for the first time, and Cox Automotive, another research firm, expects sales to reach 1.5 million this year. But General Motors, Ford Motor, Volkswagen and other manufacturers had been expecting an even faster ramp-up.
But consumers have balked at the high prices of many of the newest electric models. Many drivers are also reluctant to make the switch to battery power, because they are not sure they will be able to find enough places to quickly refuel. That has forced automakers to reset their plans.
G.M. had once forecast it would produce 400,000 electric vehicles by the middle of 2024 but now has given up that target, and it has delayed the production of some electric models.
Ford had been aiming to have enough factory capacity by the end of 2024 to make 600,000 battery-powered vehicles a year, but it recently lowered production plans for its electric F-150 Lightning and its electric sport-utility vehicle, the Mustang Mach-E.
On Wednesday, G.M. said that its sales of new vehicles in the United States jumped 14 percent last year. The company sold 2.6 million cars and light trucks in 2023, up from 2.3 million in 2022, when the chip shortage limited production.
G.M. sold about 76,000 electric vehicles, up from 39,000 in 2022. But most were Chevrolet Bolts, a model that the company recently stopped making. Only about 13,000 were vehicle based on newer battery technology that G.M. had been hoping would make its electric vehicles affordable to many more car buyers.
Sales for G.M. in the fourth quarter were relatively weak. They climbed just 0.3 percent from the same period a year earlier and were down 7 percent compared with the third quarter of 2023. The company said the sales of several important models were limited by a strike at some of its plants by the United Automobile Workers union.
Separately, Toyota Motor, the second largest seller of cars in the United States after G.M., said its 2023 sales rose 7 percent, to 2.2 million vehicles. The company's sales in the fourth quarter were 15.4 percent higher than in the same quarter a year ago and about 5 percent higher than in the third quarter.
Stellantis, the maker of Chrysler, Ram and Jeep vehicles, said that it sold 1.5 million cars and trucks in 2023, about 1 percent less than the year before. The company plans to introduce eight new electric vehicles this year, and it aims to have battery-powered models account for half of its North American sales by the end of the decade.
Honda, Hyundai and Kia also on Wednesday reported strong U.S. sales for 2023 And on Tuesday, Tesla, which dominates the electric car business in the United States, said it sold 1.8 million cars worldwide last year, up 38 percent from 2022.
Ford is expected to report its sales total on Thursday.

Full text: Lawmakers approved $ 5 billion for states to build a network of fast chargers two years ago. Although some states have made progress in recent weeks, most have not yet awarded contracts or started construction.
More than two years ago, lawmakers approved billions of dollars to build out a national electric vehicle charging network in the hopes of encouraging more drivers to switch to cleaner cars. The money, included in the bipartisan infrastructure law, was intended to help assure drivers they could reliably travel longer distances without running out of power.
But a robust federal charging network is still years away. Only two states -- Ohio and New York -- have opened any charging stations so far. A handful of others have broken ground on projects in recent weeks, with the aim of completing them in early 2024. In total, 28 states, plus Puerto Rico, have either awarded contracts to build chargers or started accepting bids for projects as of Dec. 15. The rest are much further behind on starting construction.
Broad availability of chargers is critical for the Biden administration's goal of getting electric vehicles to make up half of new car sales by 2030. Americans routinely cite "range anxiety" as one of the biggest impediments to buying an E.V. About 80 percent of respondents cited concerns about a lack of charging stations as a reason not to purchase an electric vehicle, according to an April survey from the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
The Biden administration is trying to entice consumers to buy electric vehicles both by offering tax credits of up to $ 7,500 and promising to build out a national backbone of high-speed chargers. That network is meant to give drivers the assurance that they could reach a reliable charger every 50 miles along major roads and highways.
The White House has set a goal of building a national network of at least 500,000 public chargers by 2030, but researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have projected that the country will need more than one million public charging ports by the end of the decade.
Ben Shapiro, a researcher at RMI, a nonprofit that promotes the energy transition, said the country needed to accelerate the pace of new charging infrastructure considerably.
"People certainly have this perspective that there isn't enough charging," Mr. Shapiro said. "And that I think does hamper people's interest in E.V.s."
Electric vehicle sales have been climbing faster than any other major category of automobile, with the nation on track to hit more than one million sales for the first time this year. President Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, has also spurred a surge of investment in electric vehicle production across the country. But demand has not grown as much as expected.
Some state transportation officials said the rollout has taken more than two years because they had little experience building chargers and it has been challenging to navigate new federal requirements.
In Tennessee, officials started reviewing bids for contracts after closing applications last month. Preston Elliott, a deputy commissioner of the state's transportation department, said he thought Tennessee was moving quickly, but it still took officials about two years to get to that stage, in part because they had to submit two plans to the federal government and wanted to have conversations with stakeholders before opening bids.
"Federal funds come with lots of requirements and lots of strings," Mr. Elliott said. "I've been doing this for about 30 years, and this is the first time I've ever encountered a program where you've had to do so much planning before you spend a penny."
The U.S. Transportation Department issued final rules for the program early this year, outlining technological requirements and standards that have to be met. Chargers must be within a mile of an interstate exit or highway and have four ports that are all operational and meet minimum power levels 97 percent of the time.
But the law gave states flexibility to determine how to award contracts and dole out funds, resulting in varying degrees of progress.
Ohio became the first state to open a charger funded by the new program earlier this month. Mike DeWine, the state's Republican governor, cited charging concerns as a primary reason for getting the system up and running. There are about 43,200 electric vehicles registered in Ohio.
"This industry is not going to develop unless people think they have places where they can charge their car," Mr. DeWine said. "We want to send the signal that not only are we getting companies in here that are building things for the future, but we want our consumers in Ohio to have the ability to benefit from that."
Six more charging stations are being designed and expected to begin construction in the next month or two, state officials said. Officials expect to build about 50 charging stations by the end of 2026 to meet the program's requirement.
Most states are well behind Ohio and New York. While some are bidding out contracts to build the network, the actual installation of all of the chargers can take years to finish because projects have to clear environmental reviews and other bureaucratic hurdles in addition to the construction, state officials said. Some states are also building chargers in several phases.
"If you were talking about building a sidewalk, we build sidewalks all day long," said Mr. Elliott of Tennessee. "When you start talking about a charging system, being open 24/7 and meeting certain power thresholds, I mean, think about the complexities of that."
Mr. Elliott said state officials were planning to fund 32 charging stations to meet the program's requirement and aimed to complete those projects in two years once contracts were awarded.
Some states with sparse populations and little charging infrastructure have also taken longer to roll out their programs. In Wyoming, the state's transportation department began accepting responses this month from potential station owners to better gauge interest in using the federal funds, which can cover up to 80 percent of the project's cost, plus operating expenses.
State officials said they did not know when or if they would award contracts because that would depend on the level of interest. Keith Fulton, an assistant chief engineer at Wyoming's Transportation Department, said the process was taking more than two years partly because the department has never installed an electric vehicle charger before.
States are also considering the types of connectors they will need. Although they only have to provide ports with Combined Charging System connectors, some states, such as Texas, will also require the plugs that Tesla cars use, known as the North American Charging Standard. Ford and General Motors have also announced that they would equip future vehicles with Tesla's ports.
Loren McDonald, the chief executive of EVAdoption, a data and analysis firm that has been tracking each state's progress, said it was concerning that some automakers have not been clear about whether they will provide adapters with the purchase of vehicles. That is in part because it could complicate the ability of some drivers to use the new chargers. But he noted that Tesla has won many of the bids so far, and other station owners will probably make upgrades to adapt to the market.
Senior Biden administration officials said they expected to see a wave of new chargers becoming available in the coming months, and the federal government had taken steps to help states move more quickly, including streamlining environmental permitting processes. Once states completed the planning and design work, they would be in a position to move much faster, they said.
Gabe Klein, the executive director of the federal Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, pointed to new private investments in charging infrastructure and said he expected the country to reach the administration's goal before 2030.
"The private sector investment is staggering," Mr. Klein said.
Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, a policy and data research firm, said states have made substantial progress, but much of the work has not been visible to the public.
"I can imagine from the outside that it might look like this is taking a while," Mr. Nigro said. "But that is the process we've set up in this country for how we spend money. There are a lot of checks and balances."
Although some drivers said they wanted to see state officials use federal funds to build more chargers, they were still hesitant to make the switch to electric vehicles.
Barbara Ziegler, 66, a psychologist in Sheridan, Wyo., said she welcomed more chargers, but she did not feel comfortable yet buying an electric car. She said she often drives more than a hundred miles to see a diabetes specialist, attend conferences and go shopping in larger cities, and she was concerned about being stranded on the road because of the lack of chargers.
Ms. Ziegler said she would consider buying a hybrid car, but for now, she planned to stick with her 2012 Toyota RAV4 until it needed to be replaced.
"Here we have long, long highways without towns in between," Ms. Ziegler said. "I would be too worried to try and do the drive just on electric."

American Consumers Feeling More Confident
American consumers are feeling more confident than they have since summer, good news for businesses with the all-important holiday shopping season peaking.
The Conference Board, a business research group, said Wednesday that its consumer confidence index rose for the second straight month, to 110.7 in December from 101 in November.
That's much better than analysts' forecasts of 104.5 and the highest reading since July.
Americans' expectations of a recession in the next 12 months declined to the lowest level so far this year.
The index measures both Americans' assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months.
Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, so economists pay close attention to consumer behavior as they take measure of the broader overall economy. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Rite Aid Can No Longer Use Facial Recognition
Rite Aid has been banned from using facial recognition technology for five years over allegations that its surveillance system was used incorrectly to identify potential shoplifters, especially Black, Latino, Asian or female shoppers.
The settlement with the Federal Trade Commission addresses charges that the struggling drugstore chain didn't do enough to prevent harm to its customers and implement "reasonable procedures," the government agency said.
Rite Aid said late Tuesday that it disagrees with the allegations, but that it's glad it reached an agreement to resolve the issue.
The FTC said in a federal court complaint that technology used by Rite Aid for several years led to thousands of incorrect matches, including an incident where Rite Aid store employees stopped and searched an 11-year-old girl. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Toyota's Small Car Unit Will Suspend Shipments
Toyota Motor Corp. said Wednesday its subsidiary Daihatsu will suspend shipments of all its vehicles in and outside Japan in a damaging safety scandal after an investigation found improper testing involving 64 models.
The safety test irregularities earlier this year prompted an independent panel investigation, which found widespread and systematic problems.
Toyota, citing results of the panel, said its probe found 174 new cases of irregularities in safety test and other procedures in 25 test categories, in addition to the problems reported earlier.
"We are sorry to have betrayed the trust of our customers," Daihatsu President Soichiro Okudaira told a news conference Wednesday. He acknowledged the cheating on safety testing and procedures is tantamount to neglect of safety certificates.
"We take it very seriously as the problem that has shaken the foundation of an automaker," he said. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Founder of E.V. Start-Up Is Sentenced for Fraud: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Trevor Milton, who founded the truck company Nikola, was sentenced on Monday in a fraud case that exposed the excesses in the electric vehicle business.
The founder of the electric truck company Nikola was sentenced to four years in prison on Monday in a fraud case that highlights the financial carnage left behind by a crop of electric vehicle start-ups and their promoters.
A federal judge in Manhattan, Edgardo Ramos, sentenced Trevor Milton, Nikola's founder and former chief executive, after a jury found him guilty last year of one count of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud. Mr. Milton was accused of pumping up the value of Nikola stock by making extravagant claims about the company.
Mr. Milton told investors that Nikola had working prototypes of emission-free long-haul trucks, had billions of dollars' worth of binding orders and was producing low-cost hydrogen fuel. All those statements were false, said prosecutors, who had asked Judge Ramos to hand down an 11-year prison term and a $ 5 million fine. Lawyers for Mr. Milton, who denied the charges, had sought probation.
Judge Ramos also fined Mr. Milton $ 1 million and said he would be required to pay restitution, which will be determined later. Mr. Milton will remain free on bail while he pursues an appeal.
Choking back tears and quoting scripture during a lengthy plea for mercy, Mr. Milton told the judge that he felt "terrible for everyone involved." But, he insisted, "I did not commit these crimes."
Judge Ramos said Mr. Milton was not as bad as some people convicted of fraud whom he had sentenced, but told him that "there were still real people hurt by your actions." He added, "The loss amount was immense."
Few electric vehicle executives have been convicted of crimes, but Nikola was hardly the only new auto company to attract billions of dollars of investment without generating profits or producing many cars or trucks, leaving shareholders with huge losses.
Inspired by the success of Tesla, investors poured money into start-ups like Canoo, Lordstown Motors and Lucid Motors in recent years. Their backers and executives viewed electric vehicles as a chance to challenge established automakers like Ford Motor and General Motors -- and become rich in the process.
With far fewer parts than gasoline cars, electric vehicles should have theoretically been easier to manufacture. But building thousands of cars, establishing brands and meeting safety standards turned out to be much more difficult and costly than many start-up executives and their backers expected. Some businesses proved more adept at generating lawsuits than cars.
Many of the electric vehicle start-ups listed themselves on the stock exchange by merging with special purpose acquisition companies, which allowed businesses to avoid much of the disclosure and regulatory scrutiny that accompany conventional initial public offerings of stock.
Investors who bought these stocks have suffered enormous losses. Shares in Nikola, which is still in business but warned investors in November that it could run out of money in the next 12 months, have lost 99 percent of their value since 2020.
Nikola's stock was trading at about 90 cents a share on Monday afternoon; it traded for more than $ 65 in June 2020.
One group of investors profited -- short sellers, who make money by betting that a stock price will decline. Firms that specialize in exposing overvalued stocks feasted on Nikola and other electric vehicle start-ups.
Mr. Milton's false claims about Nikola were first reported by Hindenburg Research, an investment firm that specializes in uncovering corporate malfeasance.
Hindenburg also published a report on Mullen Automotive last year that accused the company of marketing electric vehicles imported from China as its own and claiming it was close to offering advanced solid state batteries, a technology that much larger companies like Toyota are still years away from perfecting. Mullen shares, which peaked at more than $ 3,600 in 2020, traded recently for 13 cents.
A Mullen spokesman said that "many of the points in Hindenburg were inaccurate at the time, and now dated, which renders all completely inaccurate now." In recent news releases, Mullen has said it has begun manufacturing electric trucks at a factory in Mississippi.
Another Hindenburg target was Lordstown, a would-be electric truck maker that took over a former G.M. plant in Ohio with help from the Trump administration. President Donald J. Trump hosted Lordstown's chief executive, Steve Burns, at the White House in 2020, calling the company's vehicle "an incredible concept."
Mr. Burns resigned after Hindenburg accused him of exaggerating the number of orders for Lordstown's pickup truck. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in June. (In October, an investment vehicle that Mr. Burns controls bought machinery and other Lordstown assets.) Lordstown declined to comment.
Mr. Burns said in an email that he never inflated orders, and noted that a study by an outside law firm had found inaccuracies in the Hindenburg report. He bought Lordstown's assets and hired some of the company's engineers, Mr. Burns said, because he believes that the business has unique technology.
"Under the LandX brand, we intend to build several exciting vehicles and look forward to announcing our full lineup soon," Mr. Burns said.
Short sellers have also targeted Faraday Future, a company based in Los Angeles that has so far delivered nine of its "ultra luxury" electric vehicles after a decade in business.
After J Capital Research, another short seller, published a report on Faraday in 2021, the company admitted that it had misled investors when it claimed to have 14,000 reservations which, in fact, were unpaid expressions of interest.
In September, Faraday said in a regulatory filing that its "corporate culture failed to sufficiently prioritize compliance." The company has also disclosed that it is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice.
Faraday is cooperating with authorities, a spokesman said in an email, adding that the company has "made substantial changes and enhancements to process and procedures to strengthen our governance and internal controls."
Even for companies that short sellers have not publicly accused of exaggerating their achievements and prospects, producing vehicles has proved incredibly challenging.
Canoo has announced orders worth $ 750 million from Walmart and other customers for its electric vans. The company is increasing production at a factory in Oklahoma, a spokesman said, but he declined to say when it would begin delivering vehicles in large numbers.
Canoo told investors in November that there was "substantial doubt" that it would survive. Although accounting rules required the warning, Canoo has raised $ 380 million to fund its expansion, Chris Nguyen, the spokesman, said.
Investors have grown skeptical even of companies that have managed to produce thousands of cars. Shares of Fisker, which delivered about 3,000 vehicles through the beginning of November, have fallen 95 percent from a high set in 2021. Shares of Lucid, which has said it will produce at least 8,000 luxury electric sedans this year, are down 93 percent. Shares of Rivian, a maker of electric pickups and sport utility vehicles that many analysts consider the start-up most likely to survive, are down 80 percent.
Less sophisticated investors often bore the brunt of the losses. Mr. Milton, prosecutors said in a sentencing memo, "engaged in a sustained scheme to take advantage of individual, nonprofessional investors." That included posting a video on YouTube of a prototype rolling down a hill, creating a false impression that the company had a working vehicle.
Mr. Milton also lied about his personal history, prosecutors said. He had said he dropped out of college to pursue his entrepreneurial dreams even though he was expelled for paying someone to do his academic work.
After selling some of his Nikola shares for $ 100 million in mid-2020, Mr. Milton spent $ 83.5 million on luxuries like an airplane and estate in the Turks and Caicos Islands.
Nikola investors lost more than $ 660 million, prosecutors said in the memo, rejecting claims by an expert hired by the defense who said the losses that could be blamed on Mr. Milton were far less and possibly zero.

How Putin Turned a Western Boycott Into a War Chest Bonanza: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: If companies want to leave Russia, the president is setting the terms -- in ways that benefit his government, his elites and his war.
Soon after Russian troops invaded his country, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, made a plea to Western companies: "Leave Russia," he said. "Make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny."
Hundreds of companies answered the call. Politicians and activists predicted that it would help strangle the Russian economy and undermine the Kremlin's war effort.
President Vladimir V. Putin had other plans.
Mr. Putin has turned the exits of major Western companies into a windfall for Russia's loyal elite and the state itself. He has forced companies wishing to sell to do so at fire-sale prices. He has limited sales to buyers anointed by Moscow. Sometimes he has seized firms outright.
A New York Times investigation traced how Mr. Putin has turned an expected misfortune into an enrichment scheme. Western companies that have announced departures have declared more than $ 103 billion in losses since the start of the war, according to a Times analysis of financial reports. Mr. Putin has squeezed companies for as much of that wealth as possible by dictating the terms of their departure.
He has also subjected those exits to ever-increasing taxes, generating at least $ 1.25 billion in the past year for Russia's war chest.
No private deal is safe. The Dutch beer company Heineken, for example, found a buyer this spring and set a price. But the Russian government unilaterally rejected the deal, people close to the negotiations said, and put the company's Russian holdings in the hands of an aerosol-packaging titan married to a former Russian senator.
In all, Mr. Putin has overseen one of the biggest transfers of wealth within Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Huge swaths of industries -- elevators, tires, industrial coatings and more -- are now in the hands of increasingly dominant Russian players.
In some cases, that player is the state. Government-owned enterprises have acquired the assets of corporate giants like Ikea and Toyota. In many cases, Mr. Putin personally signs off on sales.
"These are good deals for us, for sure," said Anton Pinsky, a prominent restaurateur who joined with a pro-Putin rapper and associates of a powerful senator to take over Starbucks. In an interview in Moscow, he downplayed the significance of his own deal but was clear about the effect of the Western departures.
"You screwed up, left it," he said. "We picked it up inexpensively. Thank you."
Today in Russia, a robust consumer world carries on, helping Mr. Putin maintain a sense of normalcy despite a war that has proved longer, deadlier and costlier than he predicted.
Most foreign companies remain in Russia, unwilling to lose the billions they've invested there over decades. Other businesses have been sold and now have a through-the-looking-glass feel. Krispy Kreme is now Krunchy Dream; its doughnuts come in a similar flat box with familiar flavors. Starbucks has been reborn as Stars Coffee. Its mermaid is now a Russian swan princess.
These companies can buy raw materials domestically or import them from friendly countries. And customers can still easily buy products that have supposedly been pulled from shelves. On a recent day, a Moscow supermarket offered Pepsi from Uzbekistan and Coca-Cola from Poland.
Mr. Putin's economic counterstrikes have helped to fortify support among the elites profiting from the war and to blunt the effects of Western isolation. While Ukraine is preoccupied with short-term imperatives like shoring up international support, the relative resilience of the Russian economy has enabled Mr. Putin to play a long game.
Previously undisclosed documents, financial statements and interviews with dozens of deal makers in Russia and across Europe -- many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution -- show that Moscow now micromanages practically every exit. Companies must navigate an opaque system to win approval to sell. In some cases, Mr. Putin's friends have appealed directly to him to intervene.
"Those who are leaving are losing their position," Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told The Times. "And of course, their property is being bought at a serious discount and taken over by our companies, which are doing it with pleasure."
Still, the wave of departing companies has stung. It has sent a global signal that Russia is a business pariah. The economy is strained and at risk of overheating. Mr. Putin's handling of Western departures has only reinforced Russia's image as a dangerous place to do business. Even some top Russian officials admit that decreased competition and foreign investment will hurt everyday Russians and the economy in the long term.
The Kremlin says it prefers that companies remain in Russia. But Mr. Putin scoffs at the notion that leaving will hurt. "Did they think everything would collapse here? Well, nothing of the kind happened," he said this month. "Russian companies took over and moved on."
Not every deal is a windfall. Some buyers will face steep obstacles to make their new businesses profitable.
Hanging over the exit process for Western firms is the threat of intimidation and force. The Russian authorities have investigated departing companies, interrogated workers and arrested local executives.
Last summer, Mr. Putin seized the Russian arm of the Danish brewer Carlsberg, along with roughly half a billion dollars in cash, and put them under the temporary control of one of his friends.
At least four other companies have similarly lost control of their operations this year to effective state seizures.
Today, Mr. Putin is at the helm of a fraught exit process that works to Russia's advantage. But it began in the early days of the war with the urgent goal of simply keeping the Russian economy alive.
Blocking the Exits
Speaking from the White House two weeks after the invasion, President Biden boasted that the West was crushing the Russian economy. "The list of businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing by the day," he said.
Things looked bleak for Mr. Putin. The stock exchange in Moscow was closed and the ruble had crashed. If Russia lost all the jobs, production and cash of Western companies, the effects would be devastating.
But Mr. Putin was preparing his financial rejoinder. He restricted the movement of money abroad and required that companies from "unfriendly nations" win approval before selling their businesses.
Mr. Putin was putting the brakes on just as Western executives faced pressure to accelerate. In the United States, there was perhaps no more vocal figure than the Yale University management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. He appeared on cable news programs, criticizing companies that remained in Russia.
Professor Sonnenfeld recalled that it was corporate boycotts -- more than sanctions -- that helped abolish apartheid in South Africa. He transformed his office into a sort of war room, with a Yale team grading companies on their efforts to sever Russian ties.
The question of who would end up with those companies was of little concern.
"If Putin thinks he can do better at the deep fryer, let him have at it," he said in an interview. "We really don't care. The important thing is to not have the endorsement of a renowned global brand."
Professor Sonnenfeld's list and others like it added to pressure from shareholders, Ukrainian activists and everyday consumers.
Some executives worried what would happen to their Russian employees, factories and technology if they walked away. Others were reluctant to abandon their investments over a war that might prove short-lived.
But some quickly announced intentions to go. Heineken and Carlsberg said that they would leave once they found buyers. The Canadian gold mining company Kinross did the same, and within days announced a deal for $ 680 million to sell its Russian operation to a local buyer.
OBI, a German hardware store chain, went a step further, saying that it would close all 27 stores in Russia until it found a buyer.
Mr. Putin's government, though, was already erecting hurdles.
On March 17, 2022, the Russian Trade Ministry sent a letter to local OBI managers. The letter, reviewed by The Times, urged managers to defy the company and keep the stores open, citing consumer-protection laws. There was no "economic reason" for closing, the ministry wrote.
OBI, the ministry warned, needed to fulfill "obligations to its consumers, workers and counterparties, including suppliers." That prompted a days-long cat-and-mouse game as local employees tried to reopen stores and executives in Germany tried to stop them.
The Russian authorities also demanded that OBI officials testify about their plans. Prosecutors visited a store and inspected its computer system, the company told The Times.
OBI struck a deal that spring, ultimately selling for the symbolic price of a few dollars.
The buyer, a businessman named Josef Liokumovich, passed the company's background checks and was not on any financial blacklists. But as OBI soon learned, Western companies have no control over who ultimately takes over their operations.
In less than a year, OBI's Russia operation changed owners four times, ultimately landing with associates of the Russian senator Arsen B. Kanokov, who is under U.S. Treasury sanctions. At one point, an ally of the Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov appeared in the ownership register.
Such redirection is why diplomats and experts say it is too early to understand the changing landscape. The true new owners of some businesses might not be known for years, if ever.
"These guys," Urszula Nartowska, OBI's top lawyer, said, "they have the power of what they want to take. And you have to accept that."
In June, the Kremlin demonstrated what companies could expect: Moscow approved the Kinross gold mine sale, but with a stunning alteration. The sale price had been cut in half, to $ 340 million.
The buyer, Highland Gold, would later be blacklisted by British officials who said that gold provided a "significant income stream for Russia's war effort."
"The government realized they could dictate who buys, and maybe use that power to reward connected buyers," said Alan Kartashkin, a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton who spent decades in Moscow and has negotiated the exits of Western companies.
"I remember thinking," Mr. Kartashkin added, "once they feel they have the power to control entirely private transactions, where the government has no equity interest, they're not going to stop."
'This Business Is Already Russian'
The mood was celebratory in July when the Russian minister of industry and trade, Denis V. Manturov, appeared at a St. Petersburg elevator factory.
The plant had recently belonged to the world's largest elevator company, the Connecticut-based Otis Worldwide. Now it belonged to a firm controlled by Armen M. Sarkisyan, who had made a fortune running the Russian lottery in part thanks to government connections.
Mr. Manturov bragged that Moscow had brokered special arrangements for the sale. He gushed about a new production line and robust demand for elevators in Russian high-rises. "This business is already Russian," he said. It was now known as Meteor.
Mr. Sarkisyan is an example of a unique creation of the war: a businessman who was politically connected enough to win such a prize and rich enough to close the deal -- but not so closely linked to the Kremlin that he was subject to international sanctions.
Mr. Sarkisyan and others, almost overnight, absorbed huge corners of their markets.
When the Finnish elevator giant Kone tried to sell to its employees, the authorities rejected the deal. Once again, Mr. Sarkisyan's holding company, S8 Capital, became the buyer.
S8 Capital also moved into the tire business, snapping up the Russian operation of the German company Continental, before buying the top Russian tire maker, Cordiant, and entering talks to purchase the Russian factory of the Japanese tire maker Bridgestone.
S8 Capital did not respond to requests for comment.
By the summer of 2022, Russia's economy had stabilized, the ruble had rebounded and Mr. Putin's strategy shifted.
While early in the war, companies like McDonald's had sold to local managers or local business associates, with an option to return to Russia later, such deals soon became more difficult.
Having climbed out of crisis, the government wanted to do more than just keep the doors open. It increasingly wanted to dictate the terms of every deal.
In August of that year, Mr. Putin issued a decree requiring that companies in key industries obtain his signature before selling their Russian assets. Scores of businesses, including divisions of Siemens and Caterpillar, were suddenly subject to the whims of Mr. Putin himself.
"The government was beginning to tighten up the process, and it was becoming a lot more challenging," said Laura Brank, a lawyer at Dechert helping Western companies to exit. "I was telling clients we'd better get moving quickly."
The Subcommission
For most companies trying to leave Russia, the gatekeepers operate out of a gray government building near Red Square. Eleven days after the war began, Mr. Putin empaneled a special "subcommission" there to review requests to sell.
Mr. Putin's longtime finance minister, Anton G. Siluanov, leads the subcommission, which includes officials from the Kremlin, the central bank and key ministries.
They decide whether companies can leave and under what terms.
Once a company has struck a deal with a buyer, the negotiations often begin again -- this time in secret, between the buyer and one of the Russian government ministries. The seller is largely excluded. That process, lawyers say, often ends with a lower sale price and at times a new buyer. The deal then goes to the subcommission. Sometimes, deals fall through after months of silence.
Internal minutes, reviewed by The Times, show that the subcommission scrutinizes even the smallest details. In one meeting last year, the panel approved the $ 59,000 sale of a tiny apartment owned by the Finnish tire company Nokian.
The subcommission wields enormous power. Minutes show that it rejected a proposal by the American electronics company Honeywell to sell its factories until an assessment proved that the Russian buyer was getting a 50 percent discount.
Despite the bureaucracy, businesspeople have jockeyed behind the scenes for the most lucrative assets, often appealing directly to Mr. Putin.
Such was the case in the summer of 2022, when Mondi, a British-Austrian paper company, found a buyer for one of Russia's largest mills and sought government approval to sell.
As the deal came together, one of Mr. Putin's old K.G.B. buddies, Sergei V. Chemezov, appeared. He wrote a letter asking that the president steer the mill toward a group of investors, including the state-owned firm he runs. He even suggested a way to structure the deal to get around Western sanctions. The Times reviewed a copy of the letter.
Neither Mr. Chemezov nor the state-owned company responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Chemezov's deal never happened, but neither did Mondi's original agreement. The subcommission put the mill in the hands of a Moscow property developer for significantly less than the original price.
Abroad, Professor Sonnenfeld and others kept up the pressure. More than 200 companies had earned "F" grades on his list. Professor Sonnenfeld testified before Congress in November 2022. Remaining in Russia, he said, was tantamount to supporting the government.
But under Mr. Putin's rules, leaving also directly benefited the government and, in turn, the war.
This year, the parent company of Ikea sold its Russian malls to a state-controlled bank. Nokian sold its operation to an oil company owned by a Russian regional government. The Russian operations of Nissan, Renault and Toyota were taken over by a state company.
The Russian government has looked to use former Western auto factories to produce vehicles, yachts and private jets for the state-owned luxury brand Aurus, according to an internal Trade Ministry document obtained by The Times.
Neither the Trade nor Finance Ministries responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Putin also found a way to bring money straight into state coffers.
Early on, foreign deals were subjected to what the government called a "voluntary tax" -- required for the privilege of taking money out of Russia in a lump sum. Companies that opted not to pay the tax would receive their payouts in installments.
But by early this year, Mr. Putin had stopped giving them the choice. Companies had to pay the tax, and they still might get their money in installments.
The Kremlin also made explicit what had been implied since the Kinross deal: Companies were required to sell for at least a 50 percent markdown.
Heineken, for About a Dollar
By 2023, the landscape had become unknowable. The Kremlin constantly changed the rules and seemed to be always demanding more. Companies including Unilever announced that they would rather remain in Russia than have their assets end up in the government's hands.
Against that backdrop, executives at Heineken and Carlsberg were still negotiating with prospective buyers this year when Mr. Putin awarded himself even greater powers.
The Russian government, he decreed in April, could seize foreign assets and put them under the temporary oversight of whomever it liked. Companies now risked being seized outright.
Heineken reached a deal that month and the buyer, a Kazakh businessman, requested government approval. Carlsberg executives followed suit, planning to sell to Arnest, the Russian aerosol maker that had recently snapped up the highly profitable drinks-packaging business of the U.S.-based Ball Corporation.
Both brewers felt confident that, more than a year after announcing plans to leave Russia, they would finally do so.
In July, Mr. Putin blindsided Carlsberg executives by seizing the company and placing it in the hands of his longtime associate and judo friend, Taimuraz Bolloev.
Carlsberg was an attractive target. The company controlled the iconic Russian beer brand Baltika and had recently valued its Russian operation at about $ 3 billion. Its sales application had revealed that it was sitting on a half-billion dollars in cash.
In another twist, Russian officials also rejected Heineken's deal. According to the people close to the negotiations, the authorities steered the business toward Arnest -- a consolation, perhaps, for having lost the far more lucrative Carlsberg.
The deal went through for a single euro and the promise to repay $ 100 million in debt.
For Carlsberg executives, the saga was far from over. Mr. Bolloev, they said, has pressured them to sign over the company permanently.
"It would require that we literally did a deal with Putin and his administration, creating a legitimate transaction where they could take over our business for basically close to nothing," Jacob Aarup-Andersen, the Carlsberg chief executive, said in an interview last month. "We just couldn't do that."
Within weeks, the Russian authorities had arrested two company employees and raided their homes. This month, Russian news outlets reported, Mr. Bolloev asked the authorities to nationalize the company.
Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president who is the deputy chairman of Russia's security council, expressed no sympathy for companies trying to move money out of the country and take it back to the very countries arming Ukraine.
He taunted Carlsberg, thanking them for padding the Russian budget.
"A strong budget means help for the front," he wrote last month. "In this regard, the senseless Danes also contribute to modern Russian weapons."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Soon after Russian troops invaded his country, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, made a plea to Western companies: "Leave Russia," he said. "Make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny."
Hundreds of companies answered the call. Politicians and activists predicted that it would help strangle the Russian economy and undermine the Kremlin's war effort.
President Vladimir V. Putin had other plans.
Mr. Putin has turned the exits of major Western companies into a windfall for Russia's loyal elite and the state itself. He has forced companies wishing to sell to do so at fire-sale prices. He has limited sales to buyers anointed by Moscow. Sometimes he has seized firms outright.
A New York Times investigation traced how Mr. Putin has turned an expected misfortune into an enrichment scheme. Western companies that have announced departures have declared more than $ 103 billion in losses since the start of the war, according to a Times analysis of financial reports. Mr. Putin has squeezed companies for as much of that wealth as possible by dictating the terms of their departure.
He has also subjected those exits to ever-increasing taxes, generating at least $ 1.25 billion in the past year for Russia's war chest.
No private deal is safe. The Dutch beer company Heineken, for example, found a buyer this spring and set a price. But the Russian government unilaterally rejected the deal, people close to the negotiations said, and put the company's Russian holdings in the hands of an aerosol-packaging titan married to a former Russian senator.
In all, Mr. Putin has overseen one of the biggest transfers of wealth within Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Huge swaths of industries -- elevators, tires, industrial coatings and more -- are now in the hands of increasingly dominant Russian players.
In some cases, that player is the state. Government-owned enterprises have acquired the assets of corporate giants like Ikea and Toyota. In many cases, Mr. Putin personally signs off on sales.
"These are good deals for us, for sure," said Anton Pinsky, a prominent restaurateur who joined with a pro-Putin rapper and associates of a powerful senator to take over Starbucks. In an interview in Moscow, he downplayed the significance of his own deal but was clear about the effect of the Western departures.
"You screwed up, left it," he said. "We picked it up inexpensively. Thank you."
Today in Russia, a robust consumer world carries on, helping Mr. Putin maintain a sense of normalcy despite a war that has proved longer, deadlier and costlier than he predicted.
Most foreign companies remain in Russia, unwilling to lose the billions they've invested there over decades. Other businesses have been sold and now have a through-the-looking-glass feel. Krispy Kreme is now Krunchy Dream; its doughnuts come in a similar flat box with familiar flavors. Starbucks has been reborn as Stars Coffee. Its mermaid is now a Russian swan princess.
These companies can buy raw materials domestically or import them from friendly countries. And customers can still easily buy products that have supposedly been pulled from shelves. On a recent day, a Moscow supermarket offered Pepsi from Uzbekistan and Coca-Cola from Poland.
Mr. Putin's economic counterstrikes have helped to fortify support among the elites profiting from the war and to blunt the effects of Western isolation. While Ukraine is preoccupied with short-term imperatives like shoring up international support, the relative resilience of the Russian economy has enabled Mr. Putin to play a long game.
Previously undisclosed documents, financial statements and interviews with dozens of deal makers in Russia and across Europe -- many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution -- show that Moscow now micromanages practically every exit. Companies must navigate an opaque system to win approval to sell. In some cases, Mr. Putin's friends have appealed directly to him to intervene.
"Those who are leaving are losing their position," Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told The Times. "And of course, their property is being bought at a serious discount and taken over by our companies, which are doing it with pleasure."
Still, the wave of departing companies has stung. It has sent a global signal that Russia is a business pariah. The economy is strained and at risk of overheating. Mr. Putin's handling of Western departures has only reinforced Russia's image as a dangerous place to do business. Even some top Russian officials admit that decreased competition and foreign investment will hurt everyday Russians and the economy in the long term.
The Kremlin says it prefers that companies remain in Russia. But Mr. Putin scoffs at the notion that leaving will hurt. "Did they think everything would collapse here? Well, nothing of the kind happened," he said this month. "Russian companies took over and moved on."
Not every deal is a windfall. Some buyers will face steep obstacles to make their new businesses profitable.
Hanging over the exit process for Western firms is the threat of intimidation and force. The Russian authorities have investigated departing companies, interrogated workers and arrested local executives.
Last summer, Mr. Putin seized the Russian arm of the Danish brewer Carlsberg, along with roughly half a billion dollars in cash, and put them under the temporary control of one of his friends.
At least four other companies have similarly lost control of their operations this year to effective state seizures.
Today, Mr. Putin is at the helm of a fraught exit process that works to Russia's advantage. But it began in the early days of the war with the urgent goal of simply keeping the Russian economy alive.
Speaking from the White House two weeks after the invasion, President Biden boasted that the West was crushing the Russian economy. "The list of businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing by the day," he said.
Things looked bleak for Mr. Putin. The stock exchange in Moscow was closed and the ruble had crashed. If Russia lost all the jobs, production and cash of Western companies, the effects would be devastating.
But Mr. Putin was preparing his financial rejoinder. He restricted the movement of money abroad and required that companies from "unfriendly nations" win approval before selling their businesses.
Mr. Putin was putting the brakes on just as Western executives faced pressure to accelerate. In the United States, there was perhaps no more vocal figure than the Yale University management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. He appeared on cable news programs, criticizing companies that remained in Russia.
Professor Sonnenfeld recalled that it was corporate boycotts -- more than sanctions -- that helped abolish apartheid in South Africa. He transformed his office into a sort of war room, with a Yale team grading companies on their efforts to sever Russian ties.
The question of who would end up with those companies was of little concern.
"If Putin thinks he can do better at the deep fryer, let him have at it," he said in an interview. "We really don't care. The important thing is to not have the endorsement of a renowned global brand."
Professor Sonnenfeld's list and others like it added to pressure from shareholders, Ukrainian activists and everyday consumers.
Some executives worried what would happen to their Russian employees, factories and technology if they walked away. Others were reluctant to abandon their investments over a war that might prove short-lived.
But some quickly announced intentions to go. Heineken and Carlsberg said that they would leave once they found buyers. The Canadian gold mining company Kinross did the same, and within days announced a deal for $ 680 million to sell its Russian operation to a local buyer.
OBI, a German hardware store chain, went a step further, saying that it would close all 27 stores in Russia until it found a buyer.
Mr. Putin's government, though, was already erecting hurdles.
On March 17, 2022, the Russian Trade Ministry sent a letter to local OBI managers. The letter, reviewed by The Times, urged managers to defy the company and keep the stores open, citing consumer-protection laws. There was no "economic reason" for closing, the ministry wrote.
OBI, the ministry warned, needed to fulfill "obligations to its consumers, workers and counterparties, including suppliers." That prompted a days-long cat-and-mouse game as local employees tried to reopen stores and executives in Germany tried to stop them.
The Russian authorities also demanded that OBI officials testify about their plans. Prosecutors visited a store and inspected its computer system, the company told The Times.
OBI struck a deal that spring, ultimately selling for the symbolic price of a few dollars.
The buyer, a businessman named Josef Liokumovich, passed the company's background checks and was not on any financial blacklists. But as OBI soon learned, Western companies have no control over who ultimately takes over their operations.
In less than a year, OBI's Russia operation changed owners four times, ultimately landing with associates of the Russian senator Arsen B. Kanokov, who is under U.S. Treasury sanctions. At one point, an ally of the Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov appeared in the ownership register.

"These guys," Urszula Nartowska, OBI's top lawyer, said, "they have the power of what they want to take. And you have to accept that."
In June, the Kremlin demonstrated what companies could expect: Moscow approved the Kinross gold mine sale, but with a stunning alteration. The sale price had been cut in half, to $ 340 million.
The buyer, Highland Gold, would later be blacklisted by British officials who said that gold provided a "significant income stream for Russia's war effort."
"The government realized they could dictate who buys, and maybe use that power to reward connected buyers," said Alan Kartashkin, a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton who spent decades in Moscow and has negotiated the exits of Western companies.

Tighter Tax Credits May Hurt Electric Vehicle Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Purchases of popular models like the Tesla Model 3 and the Ford Mustang Mach-E may no longer entitle buyers to tax savings because the cars do not meet tougher sourcing requirements.
Efforts to fight global warming could suffer a setback next year when new rules reduce the number of electric cars that qualify for a federal tax credit.
The credits, up to $ 7,500 a vehicle, have helped make electric cars more affordable, bringing the cost of some models below $ 30,000. Next year, for the first time, dealers will be able to give buyers the credit when they purchase a car, rather than telling them to claim it on their tax returns.
But qualifying for the subsidy will become more difficult on Jan. 1 because of Biden administration rules intended to encourage automakers to manufacture vehicles and parts in North America, while bypassing China. Most automakers are still years away from breaking their dependence on China for batteries and essential materials like refined lithium.
The stricter rules, which stem from the Inflation Reduction Act, throw up another impediment to electric vehicles. Sales of such cars and trucks are already growing less briskly than a year ago because of high interest rates and drivers' anxiety about finding charging stations.
Electric vehicles are still the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, and Americans have already bought more than one million this year. Sales will rise another 32 percent in 2024, according to BloombergNEF, compared to 47 percent in 2023. But Ford Motor, General Motors and Tesla have slowed investment as the pace of growth has cooled.
The list of fully electric vehicles that qualify for tax credits was already limited. Under rules that took effect this year, the credit was available only to cars manufactured in North America.
To collect the full credit, carmakers also must meet quotas on how much of their battery components and certain raw materials come from the United States or trade allies. Tesla, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Rivian and Nissan are the only companies offering electric cars that qualify for the at least a partial credit. Some plug-in hybrid cars from Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Jeep and Lincoln also qualify for tax breaks.
New rules kicking in on Jan. 1 add another set of restrictions, disqualifying vehicles containing components made in China or made elsewhere by a firm under the control of the Chinese government.
"If it was already confusing for consumers, it gets even more confusing," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online marketplace.
Tesla, which accounts for half of all the electric vehicles sold in the United States, has warned on its website that the least expensive Model 3 sedan and a long-range version will no longer qualify after Dec. 31. The cars have a battery made in China. The existing credits lowered the price of the base Model 3 to around $ 30,000, on a par with similarly equipped gasoline cars like the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord.
The stricter rules will also disqualify Ford's Mustang Mach-E, which has been eligible for half the credit and was the fourth-most-popular U.S. electric vehicle this year. Ford is still figuring out whether the F-150 Lighting, an electric pickup, will be eligible, a spokesman said.
The rules are complex and could still be modified by administration officials, leading to confusion among industry executives. In the worst case, only a handful of vehicles will qualify.
Volkswagen said it is "cautiously optimistic" that its ID.4 electric sport utility vehicle, made in Chattanooga, Tenn., will continue to get the credit.
General Motors said it is assessing whether its electric lineup, which includes the Chevrolet Bolt and an electric version of the Silverado pickup, will qualify. Nissan, whose electric Leaf is eligible for half of the $ 7,500 credit, did not respond to a request for comment. Rivian, whose electric pickups and S.U.V.s have qualified, also did not respond.
There is another way drivers can benefit from the credit. Under an exception intended for businesses with vehicle fleets, the Inflation Reduction Act allows dealers to apply the subsidy to leased vehicles and pass it on to customers. That wrinkle has helped Hyundai and other foreign automakers remain competitive even though they do not produce electric vehicles and batteries in the United States.
More than 40 percent of Hyundai's electric vehicle sales are leases, a spokesman said, up from just 5 percent before new restrictions took effect this year. The same provision in the law has allowed people who lease cars made abroad by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volvo and Polestar to receive the credit indirectly.
But leasing is not a panacea. Many people prefer to own their cars, and foreign automakers are sore that they have been excluded from the subsidy available to buyers. The electric vehicle credit "is overly complex and unfortunately creating customer and dealer confusion," Volvo Cars said in a statement.
But the lawmakers who drafted and passed the Inflation Reduction Act have said they wrote it to force carmakers to realign their supply chains. That is happening, but the changes will take some time to bear fruit.
The list of eligible vehicles could grow over the course of 2024 as carmakers ramp up U.S. production to qualify for the credits and other subsidies.
The Korean automaker Kia expects to begin producing the EV9, a seven-passenger electric sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Georgia next year. Those domestically assembled vehicles should be eligible for half the credit, or $ 3,750, a Kia spokesman said.
Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep, plans to introduce six mass-market electric vehicles in 2024, including versions of the Dodge Charger, Jeep Wagoneer and Ram pickup. The company has not said whether the vehicles will qualify for credits.
Some hybrids, which have internal combustion engines and electric motors, will also qualify if they meet the sourcing requirements and have a battery with a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours.
The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid will most likely still be eligible for a $ 7,500 credit, a company spokesman said, while buyers of the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Jeep Wrangler 4xe hybrids are expected to be eligible for up to $ 3,750.
Market forces are pushing down the prices of electric vehicles, a trend that is expected to continue as carmakers increase production. The average list price of an electric vehicle fell to $ 63,000 in November from $ 68,000 a year earlier, according to CarGurus. The average list price of a vehicle with an internal combustion engine was $ 48,000, the same as in the previous year.
Federal subsidies and loans for battery factories and electric car plants are also helping to lower prices. At some point during the next several years, analysts expect electric vehicles to become less expensive than internal combustion models even without tax credits.
"The long-term trend is going to be one of reducing prices," Mr. Roberts of CarGurus said. "You are going to see more mainstream vehicles."

Restaurant Dishes Worth Savoring: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Each year as we travel the country to scout out candidates for our many best-restaurant lists -- whether the big national listing in the early fall or the new "best of" city lists we've begun rolling out -- our reporters and editors eat hundreds of meals in dozens of states. Inevitably we come across that one dish that we almost wish we'd ordered two of, and wish we could find closer to home.
Some are high-concept -- a Dungeness crab doughnut, for instance -- while others are just perfect examples of beloved familiars like brisket tacos or fried chicken. What they have in common, though, is that months later they still jump to mind when we're asked, "What were your favorite dishes of this year?"
And if we're back in Denver, Seattle, Burlington, Vt., or Grand Rapids, Mich., you can be sure we'll seek them out -- and you should, too. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Fried Chicken at Tavern on State
New Haven, Conn.
I will always order the fried chicken at a promising new restaurant like this one. Its fried chicken thighs with green tomato relish and radish salad was the best of many dishes I loved this year in the growing "tavern" category -- a much-needed bridge between pub grub and tweezer food. JULIA MOSKIN
Thai Red Curry Yellowtail at the Katherine
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
The Katherine is what happened when Timon Balloo realized that a neighborhood bistro near his home in Broward County, comfortably removed from the pressures of Miami, was exactly the kind of restaurant he needed at this stage of his life. The restaurant opened last year and is named after Mr. Balloo's wife and business partner, Marissa Katherine. This curry seafood dish nods to Ms. Balloo's Thai-Colombian heritage and is a delicious example of the kitchen's worldly South Florida sensibility. BRETT ANDERSON
Brisket Taco at Garcia's
San Antonio
A juicy, crisp-edged slab of brisket, a blanket-soft tortilla, some pico de gallo -- when the basics are executed this well, there's no need for any other adornments. PRIYA KRISHNA
Whole Grilled Dorado at Clandestino
Portland, Ore.
It takes a brave chef to serve a whole fish, skeleton intact, but when done right the payoff is big. At Clandestino, Lauro Romero grills whole dorado until the skin blisters, suffusing the tender white flesh with a smoky charred flavor that's brightened with a pile of fresh herbs and pickled red onions. Earthy beans and warm tortillas round out this brilliantly executed -- and rarely found -- dish. MELISSA CLARK
Mulhwe Noodles at Bansang
San Francisco
In a chilled pool of ruby-tinged, fermented chile broth, strands of capellini peacefully rest beneath slices of seasonal fish and beautiful tangles of pickles of shaved mu (radish) and cucumber. Distinct at first, everything gets mixed together, synchronizing in a bite that's deeply invigorating and bright any time of the year. ELEANORE PARK
Tostada Raspada at Cenaduria Elvira
Oakland, Calif.
Air snapping in half sounds like an imagined achievement of atmospheric physics, but it occurs when biting into this impossibly thin, crackling tostada raspada. The owner, Elvira Varela, gets the corn directly from Zapotlanejo, Jalisco in Mexico, transforming the bounty into foot-long toboggans slathered with flavorful beans and topped with a shower of cabbage and a smattering of queso fresco. The dish doubles as the best home-cooked meal of the year as well, given that Ms. Varela delivers all of this culinary sorcery directly from her home patio. ELEANORE PARK
Chicken-Fried Steak at Reba's Place
Atoka, Okla.
The chicken-fried steak at the country singer Reba McEntire's restaurant is brilliant in its unfanciness. It has an appropriately high ratio of heavily seasoned crust to meat, a slightly sweet gravy to balance and, unlike many versions of the dish, you can actually taste the flavor of the steak. PRIYA KRISHNA
Free-Range Bison With Wine-Poached Pear and Demi-Glace at Cochineal
Marfa, Texas
First-time visitors invariably note the improbability of finding a restaurant like Cochineal, with its prix-fixe menu and specialty cocktails, floating in the vast expanse of West Texas flatlands that surrounds the remote (if artsy) town of Marfa. Yet the restaurant manages to convey a sense of place that doesn't feel contrived. Large credit for that goes to the forthright, proudly regional cooking of the chef and co-owner Alexandra Gates, who last spring served a filet of free-range bison, rich in mineral flavor, that justified my daylong drive. BRETT ANDERSON
White Prawns With Hawaiian Finger Limes and Coriander at Ethel's Fancy
Palo Alto, Calif.
Simply grilled and sparingly adorned with coriander flowers, this pared-back but elegant prawn dish hews to fashion's reminder to "look in the mirror and take one thing off." It achieves much more accessorized with less. ELEANORE PARK
Halibut Chraimeh at Honey Road
Burlington, Vt.
Cara Tobin, Honey Road's chef and co-owner, honed her voice and technique cooking at Oleana, in Cambridge, Mass., a modern pioneer in its celebration of eastern Mediterranean and North African flavors and dishes. Halibut chraimeh, a special that ran this fall, is a Tunisian stew that the chef de cuisine Elliot Sion modified to include ingredients, like beets and walnuts, found in the Jewish American dishes he grew up with. BRETT ANDERSON
Dungeness Crab Doughnut at Boat Bar
Seattle
A crab doughnut might sound like stunt food at first. When you think about it, though, it makes some sense: the oceanic wash of sweet crab meat married with crème fraîche and mayonnaise, the pliant chew of the brioche-style doughnut and a zesty grating of Parmesan and fresh horseradish over the top. When you taste it, though, it makes perfect sense. It's not always on the menu, but if it is, get it. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Bacalhau a Gomes de Sa at Portugalia Marketplace
Fall River, Mass.
Portugalia has always been known for bacalhau. That's been true since it opened in a three-car garage behind a tenement house in the 1980s, through to its current incarnation, where the codfish counter is across a handsome grocery store from the wine department. So it logically follows that one of the few dishes you'll always find at the prepared food counter is this classic bacalhau stew, a rustic, salty favorite in this Portuguese stronghold on the New England coast. BRETT ANDERSON
Littlenecks and Chouriço at Matunuck Oyster Bar
South Kingstown, R.I.
"Local" translates to "right over there" at this bright waterside perch, which farms its own oysters just a short swim away in Potter Pond. But nothing on the menu sums up the location as smartly as its snappy garlic-and-white-wine sauté of sausage and Rhode Island clams, a tribute to the state's sizable population of Portuguese Americans -- and of mollusks. PATRICK FARRELL
Stuffed Cabbage at Prosperity Social Club
Cleveland
This barroom's roots run to the 1930s, when immigrants from Eastern Europe were an established presence in the city's Tremont neighborhood. The working-class legacy is still evident in Prosperity's gritty décor, gruff hospitality and signature stuffed cabbage rolls, draped in paprika-stained sour cream-sauerkraut sauce. BRETT ANDERSON
Hanger Steak at A Restaurant
Newport Beach, Calif.
Though it's tempting to think of the hanger steak as the Toyota Camry of cuts -- ubiquitous, reliable and broadly uninspiring -- the one I had at this 98-year-old Orange County spot was surprisingly perfect. Hefty char on a buttery but strongly beefy steak unfussily served. The atmosphere, a dimly lit, voluminously boothed room amid the sun-washed surroundings, only added to the experience. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Spicy Pork Adobo at Kilig
Seattle
The sibling restaurant to Musang (which is on our 25 Best Restaurants in Seattle list), Kilig is only two months old. But it has already found its modern-Filipino comfort zone. This dish -- a perfect balance of unctuously fatty pork, vinegar tang and a warm wisp of spice -- was a standout on a rainy afternoon. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Hearth Bread at Brutø
Denver
Fresh-baked bread service is fairly common these days, but the version here is something special. Made from Colorado grain milled nearby, the personal-size boules are popped into an oak-fired oven for a mere minute and a half before being handed across the counter to you, piping hot, dotted with char and served with rotating pairings like housemade achiote butter or mole blanco dipping sauce. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Golden Prawn Toast at Yangban
Los Angeles
The "golden" could refer to a few things here: the double dips in butter the local sourdough toast takes, the rich aioli-like sauce or the cured egg yolks grated over the top to finish. Or even the feeling you'll have when you taste how it all wraps beautifully around the sweet deep-sea prawns that Yangban gets from just one family on Kauai. Going back to just shrimp toast will be a challenge. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Hire Katsu Curry at KCM
Grand Rapids, Mich.
Perhaps you live in a part of the country where katsu curry is abundant, and thus does not turn heads. Grand Rapids is not such a place, which is part of the reason my visit to KCM was so memorable. Larger reasons were the crisp perfection of the fried pork and the chef-owner Jason Kim's convivial, prideful hospitality. BRETT ANDERSON
'BBQ' Whole Shrimp at Burdell
Oakland, Calif.
A take on New Orleans barbecue shrimp, these head-on creatures bathe in a sauce ramped up with stock made from the shrimp shells, Vietnamese dried shrimp and fish sauce. It's all brought back topside with a bit of the house-fermented hot sauce. You'll wish there was twice as much on the plate. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Rosette Cookie with Fresh Farmer's Cheese and Walla Walla Onion Jam at Atoma
Seattle
Rosette cookies, formed on a mold and fried to a pleasing golden crisp, are common in Scandinavian confectionery, which makes them perfectly at home in the Pacific Northwest. But as an appetizer? Well, since this version hides a creamy cheese and allium sweetness hidden inside, absolutely. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Chicken Long Rice Croquettes at Mud Hen Water
Honolulu
Bite into one of these craggy golden orbs and you get a hot gulp of gingery, soul-reviving chicken noodle soup. The "long rice" is the noodles: skinny, slippery, translucent bean-thread vermicelli. LIGAYA MISHAN
Rocky Road Ice Cream With Macadamia Nut Dragées at Fête
Honolulu
The chocolate, produced locally, is extra dark. The crunch comes from buttery macadamia nuts, dipped and sealed in more chocolate. And the marshmallows, homemade, achieve the perfect texture between cling and surrender. LIGAYA MISHAN

Full text: To understand how rising rents punish families of modest means, look no further than the queen-size bed that Jessica Jones and her three children share in her mother's living room, where each night brings a squirming, turning tussle for space in a house with no privacy.
Ms. Jones and her daughter Katelen, 14, anchor the sides like human bed rails, with two younger girls tucked in between. Joy is a 4-year-old featherweight, but Destaney, at 6, kicks so much that Ms. Jones binds her in a mermaid blanket. The day's tensions lie beside them, and midnight sneezes are shared events.
After two years of doubling up, Ms. Jones longs for a place of her own. But even though she works full time for the state government, a modest apartment would consume more than half of her income, a burden most landlords find disqualifying and one she could not sustain.
With $ 41,000 a year in earnings and child support, she is, by government definition, not poor -- just homeless.
"My anxiety is through the roof," she said. "I feel almost hopeless."
Unaffordable rents are changing low-income life, blighting the prospects of not only the poor but also growing shares of the lower middle class after decades in which rent increases have outpaced income growth.
Nearly two-thirds of households in the bottom 20 percent of incomes face "severe cost burdens," meaning they pay more than half of their income for rent and utilities, according to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.
Among working-class renters -- the 20 percent of people in the next level up the income scale -- the share with severe burdens has nearly tripled in two decades to 17 percent.
For both groups, the proportion with severe cost burdens has reached record highs.
"More people, higher up the ladder, are facing impossible trade-offs," said Whitney Airgood-Obrycki, a researcher at the Harvard Center.
The federal government deems shelter affordable if it takes 30 percent or less of household income, a goal that only about half of the nation's 44 million renter households meet.
In consuming half or more of a family's income, severe rent burdens steal from essential needs like food and medicine. They destroy the ability to save. They force frequent, destabilizing moves, unsettling parents at work and children in school. They flood fragile households with stress.
"Housing insecurity ripples through every domain of family life," said Stefanie DeLuca, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University. "It's this constant mental and emotional tax."
The growing burdens coincide with the declining reach of federal housing aid. Since 2004, the number of households served by the main programs for the poorest renters -- public housing, Section 8 and Housing Choice Vouchers -- has fallen by 6 percent, the Harvard analysis found, while the number eligible has soared.
Ms. Jones, who moved in with her mother after her landlord did not renew the lease on a subsidized apartment, said the displacement had wreaked family havoc. Her mother complains that rambunctious children fill the house with noise. Katelen's moods darkened and her grades dived. Sleepless and anxious, Ms. Jones took a medical leave, then passed out and suffered a concussion.
"I felt like I was going to die, I was so stressed out," she said.
Similar stories abound in Charleston, which illustrates the forces that have raised housing costs nationwide. The problem is not that poverty has grown but that prosperity has spread in unequal fashion, bidding up rents and leaving behind families of modest means as federal aid declined. Jacqueline Drayton, a longtime Verizon worker, skipped meals to rent a suburban house that exhausted more than 60 percent of her income, then got laid off. Latoyia Cruz-Rivas thought she could handle an apartment that consumed more than half her income as a school bus driver. After an eviction proved her wrong, she lived in her car with her son and their dog.
As the Joneses' crisis stretches into its third year, Katelen's singing has become a source of daily conflict. As a performer at church and an arts charter school, she considers singing her greatest joy, but her grandmother calls it noise. As doors slam and tempers flare, the housing crisis spills into the driveway, where her big voice fills a parked car and she forgets how long her family has waited for shelter it can afford.
"I feel so stuck," she said. "But singing helps me feel free."
No Buffer
People who spend half their income for shelter have no room for error. A few canceled work shifts or an unexpected car repair can leave them short. That poses special peril in South Carolina, where landlords can evict any tenant who pays even a single month's rent more than five days late.
Ms. Cruz-Rivas discovered the risk.
A school bus driver from Greensboro, N.C., Ms. Cruz-Rivas, 42, moved to Charleston during the coronavirus pandemic, drawn by significantly higher wages and a desire to distance her teenage sons, Jevon and Amon, from troublemaking friends. She did not realize that rents were higher, too. With utilities, her apartment took more than half of her income, but, she said, "I figured, 'I'll make it work."'
For a while she did, if barely. But her hours shrank as more drivers returned to work after the pandemic, and Jevon's job at Pizza Hut did not fill the gap. Federal pandemic aid staved off one eviction threat. Then came the kind of cascading misfortune that can put tenants on the street.
Her sons totaled her car. The state suspended her commercial driver's license. In the weeks it took to reinstate it, she lacked an income, and her landlord moved to evict her.
Amon moved in with his girlfriend. A school social worker who serves homeless families, Sonya Jones, arranged motel stays and a donated car. When the motel money ran out, Ms. Cruz-Rivas and Jevon began living in the car with their dog, Koffi.
Ms. Cruz-Rivas, who takes pride in her lack of self-pity, faced the ordeal with odd cheerfulness. "There's people in worse situations than us," she said. They slept in a parking lot and used the restroom at the all-night convenience store where Jevon found a job.
Having survived childhood sexual abuse, she added, "I can train my mind to accept anything."
Reclining in the car one night this fall, Ms. Cruz-Rivas scrolled through social media while Jevon watched football on his phone with Koffi at his feet.
"We just lay back and chill," Ms. Cruz-Rivas said.
"We talk, laugh, joke," Jevon said.
Their matching tattoos read "family first." It would have made a homey scene if home wasn't an old Toyota.
Ms. Cruz-Rivas switched jobs to a limousine service, where her clientele of businesswomen and bachelorettes had no idea their upbeat driver slept in her car.
An eviction record makes Ms. Cruz-Rivas a pariah in the rental market, but Jevon, now 20, joined a waiting list for subsidized housing. After months of homelessness, he landed an apartment where they can sleep without hitting the steering wheel.
'Rent Has an Effect on Your Mental Health'
Thirty miles from the parking lot where Ms. Cruz-Rivas slept, Jacqueline Drayton has a four-bedroom house in suburban Summerville, where traffic stops for geese crossings and residents car-pool in golf carts.
But she grapples with the same affordability crisis. With shelter costs consuming most of her income, Ms. Drayton, the former Verizon worker, said the burden depresses everything from her food budget to her psychological health.
"It's nerve-racking," she said. "Sometimes I don't know if I'm going to make it."
The shortage of affordable housing may seem perennial, but the problem has changed. In 1960, shelter took 28 percent of the average renter's income (though some was so bad it lacked indoor plumbing). Now it takes 41 percent of income -- and for poor renters, 75 percent.
Ms. Drayton's father, James Earl Drayton, was one of nine firefighters honored as heroes after their deaths in a 2007 fire. But she notes that he gave his life for a city with little housing she can afford.
Concerned about violence, Ms. Drayton left the city eight years ago when she was married and two incomes covered suburban rent. Divorce changed the math. With earnings of about $ 42,000 and little child support, she moved with four children to a house that consumed roughly two-thirds of her income.
Suddenly everything revolved around rent. She skipped meals to pay it. She used tax refunds to pay it in advance. She felt anxious before she paid the rent and depleted afterward. Her post-divorce depression deepened.
"Rent definitely took over everything," she said. "Rent has an effect on your mental health."
Needing back surgery this year, Ms. Drayton scheduled an unpaid leave around her tax refund, but recovery took longer than planned. She deferred other bills, borrowed from her sister and tapped retirement funds, but still fell behind.
Among the forces that may be raising rents nationwide is the emergence of large corporate landlords. Ms. Drayton rented from AMH, a public company with 60,000 homes that asked a court to put her out. Most tenants in housing court lack attorneys, but a pro bono lawyer negotiated a deal to let her move without an eviction on her record. Yet her next rental was even more expensive and owned by Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity giant, through its property company, FirstKey Homes.
After 18 years at Verizon, she was laid off amid the move, with seven months of severance pay.
Ms. Drayton's daughter, a high school freshman, wanted to join cheerleading this fall, but the $ 650 fee ended the conversation. It was not a close call.
"To be honest, I go without food sometimes -- just having milk and cereal," Ms. Drayton said. "Sometimes I couldn't even get that."
A Consequence of Poverty, and a Cause
As a midsize city in a low-cost state, Charleston may not seem like a place with impossible housing math. But it has long drawn new residents with big housing budgets attracted to its beaches, history and food, and a surge of manufacturing jobs has swelled their ranks.
Higher housing prices at the top mean higher prices below as land values rise and gentrification quickens. Mount Pleasant, an affluent suburb, compounded the shortage of affordable shelter by banning new apartments.
"Charleston County has become a victim of its own success," the county's housing plan warns.
Even after adjusting for inflation, the cost of a basic two-bedroom apartment rose by a third over the past decade, according to federal estimates called fair-market rents, taking $ 4,600 a year from tenants of modest means.
Civic pride suffered a blow in 2018 when Princeton researchers found the city of North Charleston had the country's highest eviction rate, a product of high rents and weak tenant-protection laws.
"Most of them are working, but it just takes one unfortunate event -- 'I was sick' or 'my car broke down,"' said Taylor Rumble, a lawyer with Charleston Legal Access, a nonprofit law firm that expanded its tenant work. "It's heartbreaking, but 'heartbreaking' isn't a legal defense."
The county set aside $ 20 million in federal stimulus funds for affordable housing. But that is only 4 percent of the investment the plan said is needed.
Budget-busting rents are not just an urban problem. Three-quarters of Charleston's low-income households (those in the bottom fifth) pay more than half their income for shelter. But the same holds true in tiny Bladen County, N.C. (population 29,000), where low rent is offset by low pay. The share of low-income households with severe rent burdens ranges from 73 percent in big cities to 50 percent in rural areas.
Standard measures, used by the government and scholars, modestly overstate the problem because the Census Bureau's definition of income omits some forms of aid, including food stamps and tax credits. At the request of The New York Times, Danielle Wilson and Christopher Wimer of Columbia University and Ms. Airgood-Obrycki of Harvard re-estimated rent burdens counting that aid.
For 2019, that lowered the share of households in the bottom quintile who are paying half or more of their income for shelter to 52 percent, from 60 percent. "You still have more than half the low-income population with severe burdens," Ms. Wilson said.
Housing burdens are a consequence of poverty but also a cause. Research has shown that high rent burdens can harm cognitive development, increase delinquent behavior and reduce spending on health care and food, while evictions worsen mental and physical health and force families into worse neighborhoods.
Hope Harvey, a University of Kentucky sociologist, emphasized how much "cognitive bandwidth" housing instability consumes. "It permeates every aspect of family life," she said. "There's little left for anything else."
'A House for the Family'
It certainly permeates the life of Ms. Jones, the state worker who shares a bed with three children in her mother's packed home. She finds it impossible to honor her mother's demands for quiet without leaving her children feeling caged.
"It's like walking on eggshells," she said. "I feel like I've failed my kids."
A former beautician, Ms. Jones has spent four years doing community outreach for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC. "I love, love, love my job," she said.
But even with child support and occasional hairdressing jobs, her $ 41,000 income offers few options to house a family of four in Charleston.
A four-bedroom home, at fair-market rents, would deplete 70 percent of her income. Three bedrooms would take 56 percent and two bedrooms 45 percent. She does not think she can pay even the least of those sums, and her low credit score decreases the odds a landlord would take the chance.
Ms. Jones reached an emotional breaking point last year after she and the children caught Covid and Destaney was hospitalized. Ms. Jones took a medical leave, developed migraines and got a concussion from passing out. She is taking medication for anxiety, which she blames on the overcrowding.
"I've not been able to sleep -- at all," she said.
Mature beyond her 14 years, Katelen, the singer, is a co-parent of sorts, a patient caretaker of her younger siblings. But she is also an adolescent who lost her privacy at an age when it is especially prized. And the fights with her grandmother over her singing leave her both furious and tinged with self-reproach.
"I'm trying not to lash out at her because I know it's disrespectful," she said.
On a recent evening she escaped to the car and conjured a song of longing from "The Little Mermaid," then switched to a gospel romp about the transformative power of the Holy Spirit.
I feel your Spirit
All over me
It's in my hands, in my soul, down in my feet
From the back seat, Destaney supplied hand claps, backup vocals and nodding affirmation that she felt the Spirit, too. Then she fished a drawing from her first-grade backpack. It captured on paper what had eluded her in life: a house with four people and four beds.
"A house for the family," she said.

U.A.W. Says 3 Carmakers Violated Labor Laws: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A week after declaring a drive to organize nonunion automakers, the United Automobile Workers union filed charges against three foreign manufacturers.
The United Automobile Workers union accused three foreign automakers on Monday of unfair labor practices, asserting that they had interfered with efforts by employees to build support for the union at U.S. plants.
The union said it had filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board contending that the automakers -- Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen -- had tried to prevent workers from discussing U.A.W. representation at work and that the companies had discriminated against those who had done so.
The action came two weeks after the U.A.W. announced an effort to organize nonunion plants owned by 10 foreign-owned companies, along with the domestic manufacturers Tesla, Lucid and Rivian, which make electric vehicles. The union has tried unsuccessfully to unionize some of those companies' factories in recent years, but not simultaneously on such a wide scale.
The U.A.W. said Monday that hundreds of workers at Honda's plant in Greensburg, Ind., and at Hyundai's plant in Montgomery, Ala., and more than 1,000 workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., had signed cards expressing support for joining the union.
At Honda, the union said, workers "report being targeted and surveilled by management for pro-union activity," while at Hyundai, "management has unlawfully confiscated, destroyed, and prohibited pro-union materials in nonwork areas during nonwork times."
It said that Volkswagen "had harassed and threatened workers for talking about the union" and that it had "confiscated and destroyed pro-union materials in the break room," among other accusations.
In a statement, Volkswagen said that it took such accusations seriously and that it would investigate the matter. "Volkswagen respects our workers' right to determine who should represent their interests in the workplace," it said.
Honda said, "We have not and would not interfere with our associates' right to engage in activity supporting or opposing the U.A.W." Hyundai said that the union's depiction of the matter was not accurate and that its workers "may choose to join a union or not as is their legal right."
Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, lashed out at the three companies in a statement issued by the union. "These companies are breaking the law in an attempt to get autoworkers to sit down and shut up instead of fighting for their fair share," he said. "But these workers are showing management that they won't be intimidated out of their right to speak up and organize for a better life."
The U.A.W. is trying to organize foreign-owned plants after a six-week wave of strikes against the three Detroit automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which makes Jeep, Chrysler and other brands -- that resulted in contracts providing record wage increases and additional gains in benefits.
In addition to Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen, the foreign companies that the U.A.W. said last week that it was targeting are Toyota, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Mazda and Volvo.
The new contracts at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis raise the top hourly wage to $ 40 at the end of the four-and-a-half-year term, from $ 32 previously. Hourly wages at the foreign automakers in the United States generally range from the high teens to the high 20s.
After the U.A.W. agreements with the Detroit automakers were reached this fall, Honda said it would provide raises of 11 percent next year, and Hyundai said it would increase pay 14 percent next year and 25 percent by 2028. Toyota also announced raises.

Record Rent Burdens Batter Low-Income Life

NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — To understand how rising rents punish families of modest means, look no further than the queen-size bed that Jessica Jones and her three children share in her mother’s living room, where each night brings a squirming, turning tussle for space in a house with no privacy.
Jones and her daughter Katelen, 14, anchor the sides like human bed rails, with two younger girls tucked in between. Joy is a 4-year-old featherweight, but Destaney, at 6, kicks so much that Jones binds her in a mermaid blanket. The day’s tensions lie beside them, and midnight sneezes are shared events.

For a while she did, if barely. But her hours shrank as more drivers returned to work after the pandemic, and Jevon’s job at Pizza Hut did not fill the gap. Federal pandemic aid staved off one eviction threat. Then came the kind of cascading misfortune that can put tenants on the street.
Her sons totaled her car. The state suspended her commercial driver’s license. In the weeks it took to reinstate it, she lacked an income, and her landlord moved to evict her.
Amon moved in with his girlfriend. A school social worker who serves homeless families, Sonya Jones, arranged motel stays and a donated car. When the motel money ran out, Cruz-Rivas and Jevon began living in the car with their dog, Koffi.
Cruz-Rivas, who takes pride in her lack of self-pity, faced the ordeal with odd cheerfulness. “There’s people in worse situations than us,” she said. They slept in a parking lot and used the restroom at the all-night convenience store where Jevon found a job.
Having survived childhood sexual abuse, she added, “I can train my mind to accept anything.”
Reclining in the car one night this fall, Cruz-Rivas scrolled through social media while Jevon watched football on his phone with Koffi at his feet.
“We just lay back and chill,” Cruz-Rivas said.
“We talk, laugh, joke,” Jevon said.
Their matching tattoos read “family first.” It would have made a homey scene if home wasn’t an old Toyota.
Cruz-Rivas switched jobs to a limousine service, where her clientele of businesswomen and bachelorettes had no idea their upbeat driver slept in her car.
An eviction record makes Cruz-Rivas a pariah in the rental market, but Jevon, now 20, joined a waiting list for subsidized housing. After months of homelessness, he landed an apartment where they can sleep without hitting the steering wheel.
‘Rent Has an Effect on Your Mental Health’
Thirty miles from the parking lot where Cruz-Rivas slept, Jacqueline Drayton has a four-bedroom house in suburban Summerville, where traffic stops for geese crossings and residents carpool in golf carts.
But she grapples with the same affordability crisis. With shelter costs consuming most of her income, Drayton, the former Verizon worker, said the burden depresses everything from her food budget to her psychological health.
“It’s nerve-wracking,” she said. “Sometimes I don’t know if I’m going to make it.”
The shortage of affordable housing may seem perennial, but the problem has changed. In 1960, shelter took 28% of the average renter’s income (though some was so bad it lacked indoor plumbing). Now it takes 41% of income — and for poor renters, 75%.
Drayton’s father, James Earl Drayton, was one of nine firefighters honored as heroes after their deaths in a 2007 fire. But she notes that he gave his life for a city with little housing she can afford.
Concerned about violence, Drayton left the city eight years ago when she was married and two incomes covered suburban rent. Divorce changed the math. With earnings of about $42,000 and little child support, she moved with four children to a house that consumed roughly two-thirds of her income.
Suddenly everything revolved around rent. She skipped meals to pay it. She used tax refunds to pay it in advance. She felt anxious before she paid the rent and depleted afterward. Her post-divorce depression deepened.
“Rent definitely took over everything,” she said. “Rent has an effect on your mental health.”
Needing back surgery this year, Drayton scheduled an unpaid leave around her tax refund, but recovery took longer than planned. She deferred other bills, borrowed from her sister and tapped retirement funds, but still fell behind.
Among the forces that may be raising rents nationwide is the emergence of large corporate landlords. Drayton rented from AMH, a public company with 60,000 homes that asked a court to put her out. Most tenants in housing court lack attorneys, but a pro bono lawyer negotiated a deal to let her move without an eviction on her record. Yet her next rental was even more expensive and owned by Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity giant, through its property company, FirstKey Homes.
After 18 years at Verizon, she was laid off amid the move, with seven months of severance pay.
Drayton’s daughter, a high school freshman, wanted to join cheerleading this fall, but the $650 fee ended the conversation. It was not a close call.
“To be honest, I go without food sometimes — just having milk and cereal,” Drayton said. “Sometimes I couldn’t even get that.”
A Consequence of Poverty, and a Cause
As a midsize city in a low-cost state, Charleston might not seem like a place with impossible housing math. But it has long drawn new residents with big housing budgets attracted to its beaches, history and food, and a surge of manufacturing jobs has swelled their ranks.
Higher housing prices at the top mean higher prices below as land values rise and gentrification quickens. Mount Pleasant, an affluent suburb, compounded the shortage of affordable shelter by banning new apartments.
“Charleston County has become a victim of its own success,” the county’s housing plan warns.
Even after adjusting for inflation, the cost of a basic two-bedroom apartment rose by a third over the past decade, according to federal estimates called fair-market rents, taking $4,600 a year from tenants of modest means.
Civic pride suffered a blow in 2018 when Princeton researchers found the city of North Charleston had the country’s highest eviction rate, a product of high rents and weak tenant-protection laws.
“Most of them are working, but it just takes one unfortunate event — ‘I was sick’ or ‘my car broke down,’” said Taylor Rumble, a lawyer with Charleston Legal Access, a nonprofit law firm that expanded its tenant work. “It’s heartbreaking, but ‘heartbreaking’ isn’t a legal defense.”
The county set aside $20 million in federal stimulus funds for affordable housing. But that is only 4% of the investment the plan said is needed.
Budget-busting rents are not just an urban problem. Three-quarters of Charleston’s low-income households (those in the bottom fifth) pay more than half their income for shelter. But the same holds true in tiny Bladen County, North Carolina (population 29,000), where low rent is offset by low pay. The share of low-income households with severe rent burdens ranges from 73% in big cities to 50% in rural areas.
Standard measures, used by the government and scholars, modestly overstate the problem because the Census Bureau’s definition of income omits some forms of aid, including food stamps and tax credits. At the request of The New York Times, Danielle Wilson and Christopher Wimer of Columbia University and Airgood-Obrycki of Harvard re-estimated rent burdens counting that aid.
For 2019, that lowered the share of households in the bottom quintile who are paying half or more of their income for shelter to 52%, from 60%. “You still have more than half the low-income population with severe burdens,” Wilson said.
Housing burdens are a consequence of poverty but also a cause. Research has shown that high rent burdens can harm cognitive development, increase delinquent behavior and reduce spending on health care and food, while evictions worsen mental and physical health and force families into worse neighborhoods.
Hope Harvey, a University of Kentucky sociologist, emphasized how much “cognitive bandwidth” housing instability consumes. “It permeates every aspect of family life,” she said. “There’s little left for anything else.”
‘A House for the Family’
It certainly permeates the life of Jones, the state worker who shares a bed with three children in her mother’s packed home. She finds it impossible to honor her mother’s demands for quiet without leaving her children feeling caged.
“It’s like walking on eggshells,” she said. “I feel like I’ve failed my kids.”
A former beautician, Jones has spent four years doing community outreach for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC. “I love, love, love my job,” she said.
But even with child support and occasional hairdressing jobs, her $41,000 income offers few options to house a family of four in Charleston.
A four-bedroom home, at fair-market rents, would deplete 70% of her income. Three bedrooms would take 56% and two bedrooms 45%. She does not think she can pay even the least of those sums, and her low credit score decreases the odds a landlord would take the chance.
Jones reached an emotional breaking point last year after she and the children caught COVID and Destaney was hospitalized. Jones took a medical leave, developed migraines and got a concussion from passing out. She is taking medication for anxiety, which she blames on the overcrowding.
“I’ve not been able to sleep — at all,” she said.
Mature beyond her 14 years, Katelen, the singer, is a co-parent of sorts, a patient caretaker of her younger siblings. But she is also an adolescent who lost her privacy at an age when it is especially prized. And the fights with her grandmother over her singing leave her both furious and tinged with self-reproach.
“I’m trying not to lash out at her because I know it’s disrespectful,” she said.
On a recent evening she escaped to the car and conjured a song of longing from “The Little Mermaid,” then switched to a gospel romp about the transformative power of the Holy Spirit.
I feel your Spirit
All over me
It’s in my hands, in my soul, down in my feet
From the back seat, Destaney supplied hand claps, backup vocals and nodding affirmation that she felt the Spirit, too. Then she fished a drawing from her first-grade backpack. It captured on paper what had eluded her in life: a house with four people and four beds.
“A house for the family,” she said.

Last Quarter's Growth Is Upgraded to 5.2%
Shrugging off higher interest rates, America's consumers spent enough to help drive the economy to a brisk 5.2 percent annual pace from July through September, the government reported Wednesday, upgrading its previous estimate.
The government had previously estimated that the economy grew at a 4.9 percent annual rate last quarter.
In the current fourth quarter, though, economists say growth is likely slowing sharply from the cumulative effects of higher borrowing rates on consumer and business spending.
Wednesday's second estimate of growth for the July-September quarter confirmed that the economy sharply accelerated from its 2.1 percent rate from April through June. It showed that the U.S. gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and services -- grew at its fastest quarterly rate in nearly two years. ASSOCIATED PRESS
ACQUISITIONS
Blackstone Buys Rover in a $ 2.3 Billion Deal
The private equity giant Blackstone will acquire the pet care app Rover in an all-cash deal valued at $ 2.3 billion, the companies announced Wednesday.
Shares of Rover climbed about 28 percent on news of the deal, which will pay Rover shareholders $ 11 per share.
The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024, at which time Rover will no longer be a publicly traded company.
Rover was founded in 2011, connecting pet owners with care providers who provide boarding, in-home pet sitting and dog walking, among other services.
The Seattle-based company says from its inception through Sept. 30, more than 93 million services have been booked by more than 4 million pet owners with more than 1 million pet care providers paid across North America and Europe. ASSOCIATED PRESS
AUTOMOTIVE
Toyota Shaves Stake in Parts Maker Denso
Toyota is selling a part of its stake in the components maker Denso to raise cash for its drive toward electric vehicles and other innovations.
The move, announced Wednesday, is estimated to raise about 290 billion yen, or $ 2 billion, given recent share prices. The number of shares Toyota Motor Corp. plans to sell total more than 124 million shares, lowering its stake in Denso Corp. from 24.2 percent to 20 percent, while remaining the top stakeholder.
Toyota said the money would go into developing smart-driving technology and a wide range of other ongoing initiatives.
All the world's major automakers are working on strengthening their lineup of electric vehicles, as concerns grow about climate change. That requires a great deal of investment.
Toyota affiliates, Toyota Industries and Aisin, are also selling a portion of their Denso shares, officials said. ASSOCIATED PRESS

U.A.W. Aims To Unionize More Plants: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The United Automobile Workers' effort, with a long-elusive goal, follows its success in securing big raises in contracts with the Detroit automakers.
The United Automobile Workers union announced Wednesday that it was undertaking an ambitious drive to organize plants owned by more than a dozen nonunion automakers, including Tesla and several foreign companies -- a goal that has long eluded it.
The move comes weeks after the U.A.W. won new contracts from General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis that included wage increases of 25 percent or more over four and a half years for its 146,000 members employed there.
In addition to Tesla, the targets of the drive are two other electric vehicle start-ups, Lucid and Rivian, and 10 foreign-owned automakers: Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo.
The U.S. plants owned by those companies employ nearly 150,000 workers in 13 states, the union said.
If the organizing drive gains momentum, it could become one of the largest by the U.A.W. since its infancy in the 1930s. The union's past efforts to organize even single plants owned by the foreign automakers, concentrated in the South, came to nought. A foothold among those companies would signal a big shift in the American auto industry, where nonunion manufacturers have long had a significant cost advantage over the Detroit automakers.
The union said the organizing drive had been prompted by inquiries from several thousand workers at nonunion plants.
"Workers across the country, from the West to the Midwest and especially in the South, are reaching out to join our movement and to join the U.A.W.," the union's president, Shawn Fain, said in a video posted on Facebook. "The money is there. The time is right."
A Honda statement cited the automaker's "competitive wages and benefits," adding, "We do not believe an outside party would enhance the excellent employment experience of our associates." Hyundai referred to its "excellent wages and benefits," adding, "Our team members have not shown an interest in union representation." Subaru pointed to wage increases and its benefits package but did not comment directly on the union drive. Rivian and Volkswagen said they had no comment.
At the DealBook Summit conference sponsored by The New York Times on Wednesday, Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, said, "If Tesla gets unionized, it will be because we deserve it and we failed in some way." He reiterated his opposition to unions, saying that "it's not good to have an adversarial relationship" between groups within a company.
The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.
On Wednesday, the U.A.W. activated websites where workers can electronically sign cards that serve as an official certification of their desire to have union representation. Earlier, at a handful of plants, the U.A.W. had already received signed cards from more than 30 percent of the work force, the threshold required under federal law for the union to move forward with a vote on unionization, a person familiar with the matter said.
The union is now working to send organizers to areas around these nonunion plants to collaborate with workers at those factories, this person said.
After the U.A.W. reached agreements with the Detroit automakers to raise wages, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai announced that they, too, would increase workers' pay.
Toyota has told workers that it will raise hourly rates 9 percent in January. Honda will lift wages 11 percent and Hyundai 14 percent next year. Hyundai plans to increase wages 25 percent by 2028.
The U.A.W. said Wednesday that it was making a concerted effort to organize a large Toyota plant in Georgetown, Ky., that employs about 7,800 workers and produces the Camry sedan and RAV4 sport utility vehicle.
U.A.W. members have long earned more than nonunion workers. At plants in the South, wages tend to start below $ 20 an hour and top out at less than $ 30. The top U.A.W. hourly wage, previously $ 32, climbed to more than $ 40 in the contracts the union signed with the three Detroit manufacturers.
The U.A.W. has fallen short twice in the past decade -- by narrow margins, in 2014 and 2019 -- in unionization votes at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn. The U.A.W. lost by a substantial margin at a Nissan plant in Canton, Miss., in 2017. Organizing efforts at other companies' plants have petered out before coming to a vote.
But after Mr. Fain became the union's president this year, the union promised a more aggressive approach to its contract talks with the Big Three and vowed to renew efforts to widen its reach in the industry.
In addition to wage gains at the Detroit companies, the U.A.W. won agreements to preserve jobs and to keep open a Stellantis plant in Illinois that had been slated to close.
Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the U.A.W.'s wage gains created a stronger case for joining the union.
"It shows collective bargaining works and shows the U.A.W. was successful," he said. "They can say: 'We saved this plant. Look at what we got. You can have this, too."'
Past organizing drives were hurt because the U.A.W. had a tarnished image, Mr. Wheaton added: Many unionized plants had closed, its members had been required to accept wage and benefit cuts to help the Detroit manufacturers survive the 2009 financial crisis, and federal corruption investigations had implicated senior union officials.
"A lot of the negative things about the union -- a lot of that stuff has gone away now," Mr. Wheaton said.

The United Auto Workers union announced Wednesday that it was undertaking an ambitious drive to organize plants owned by more than a dozen nonunion automakers, including Tesla and several foreign companies — a goal that has long eluded it.
The move comes weeks after the UAW won new contracts from General Motors, Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis that included wage increases of 25% or more over 4 1/2 years for its 146,000 members employed there.
In addition to Tesla, the targets of the drive are two other electric vehicle startups, Lucid and Rivian, and 10 foreign-owned automakers: Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo.

Full text: In the 12 years since Ravinder Sharma bought his taxi -- a 2011 Ford Crown Victoria -- he has driven more than 550,000 miles, enough to circle Earth 22 times at the Equator.
Only one other taxi that old is still carrying passengers in New York, according to the city agency that regulates cabs. That taxi, which sat unsold on a dealer's lot in the Bronx until Haroon Abdullah found it in 2013, has racked up a mere 491,000 miles.
The agency, the Taxi and Limousine Commission, says that neither car should be on the road. The reason: Both cabs are long past the seven-year retirement age for taxis.
The two drivers have dates for administrative hearings to answer summonses issued after they skipped taxi inspections in the last few months. Had the taxis undergone inspections, their meters could have been seized because of the age rule, making the cars unusable as for-hire vehicles.
Now, if the drivers lose at their hearings, the taxi agency could send a wireless signal to shut down their meters automatically. The two drivers could also face failure-to-inspect fines of up to $ 500, and their licenses could be suspended, the agency said.
A spokesman for the agency said that the two Crown Victorias were "the last of their kind," but that they needed to go. "As it was with the Model T's, Checkers and Caprices before them, their final act of safety must be a well-earned retirement," the spokesman, Jason Kersten, said.
Like many New Yorkers, Mr. Kersten said he had pleasant memories of Crown Victorias: As a college student in the 1990s, he used one as a moving van and loaded everything he owned into the trunk. Now, even Mr. Sharma and Mr. Abdullah acknowledge that their cabs are antiques. "You know you are in a classic taxi," Mr. Sharma said, as his Crown Victoria -- stately, commanding and majestic -- glided up the Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan. "I love this car."
He and Mr. Abdullah have kept up their cars -- they are shiny and quiet, even if weathered. Still, when the two Crown Victorias were new, Barack Obama was president; Michael Bloomberg was mayor; and more than 7,400 other Crown Victoria cabs of varying ages roamed the streets of New York -- more than half of the yellow taxis then in the city.
The Crown Victorias are old-school sedans with thirsty engines. Federal rankings show that the 2011 Crown Victoria averaged 16 miles per gallon in city driving. Abdullah said he got 15 to 16 miles per gallon in the city and 17 to 18 miles per gallon on highway runs with airport passengers. Mr. Sharma said he did not do such calculations. "I don't think about the gas," he said. "I'm 64. I raised my children. I just drive."
Mr. Abdullah said he bought his Crown Victoria after his previous taxi was flooded in Hurricane Sandy while parked outside his house in Howard Beach, Queens. This one sat on the high ground of a car dealer's lot in the Bronx until 2013, when he paid just over $ 21,000 for it.
Both drivers say that their cars passed recent state inspections, but that they skipped the required taxi inspections rather than risk losing their cars and their livelihoods. Mr. Kersten, the taxi commission spokesman, said that both drivers had been given pandemic extensions to allow them to keep driving their Crown Victorias.
Mr. Abdullah, whose hearing was scheduled to take place Friday, after this section went to press, said that he wanted a Toyota Siena, a minivan, but could not afford the $ 30,000 down payment. "I'm behind on my mortgage," he said. "I'm behind on my bills. If they don't allow me to drive this car, I won't make the income I need to buy a new car."
Mr. Sharma, whose hearing is scheduled for Dec. 8, said he would ask the taxi commission to let him continue driving his Crown Victoria for at least a few more months, until he turns 65. "I'm thinking if they allow me to drive, I drive," Mr. Sharma said. "If they don't, I take my Social Security and retire." He said he was under financial pressure from owning four taxi medallions and losing his savings when the medallion bubble burst in 2014.
Mr. Sharma said he had driven almost two million miles since he became a cabdriver in the 1980s. "It's a lot of mileage," he said. "If they let me drive, I'll drive. If not, I did 35 years."

Broadcom Closes Deal for Cloud Firm VMware
Broadcom on Wednesday closed its $ 69 billion acquisition of the cloud-computing firm VMware after receiving regulatory approval in its last major market, China, and ending a monthslong saga.
The deal, one of the biggest globally when announced in May 2022, was the latest in the chief executive Hock Tan's efforts to increase the chipmaker's software business.
China's regulatory approval came through on Tuesday after ongoing tensions with the U.S. around tougher chip export control measures had stoked fears among some investors on the company's ability to close the deal before the Nov. 26 deadline.
Big Tech mergers like Microsoft's now-closed $ 69 billion purchase of the "Call of Duty" publisher Activision have faced heightened regulatory pressure from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission under its chair Lina Khan. REUTERS

Volkswagen Will Raise Salaries at Factory 11%
Volkswagen said on Wednesday that it would raise salaries 11 percent for production workers at its assembly plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., weeks after the United Auto Workers union won major pay and benefit increases from the three Detroit automakers.
The company and other nonunion automakers in the U.S. have come under increased pressure to improve pay and benefits after the record contracts achieved by the U.A.W. in late October after thousands of its members went on a six-week targeted strike.
Honda and Toyota have raised wages for nonunion U.S. factory workers in recent weeks amid signs that the union is turning its attention to organizing the work force at foreign-owned and Tesla auto plants.
Hyundai Motor has also announced a 25 percent increase over the next four years for nonunion production workers in Alabama and Georgia. REUTERS

Higher Borrowing Costs Could Hinder Deere
Deere forecast 2024 profits below analysts' expectations on Wednesday, saying high borrowing costs and tighter budgets will likely dent demand for the farm equipment maker's agriculture and construction machinery.
Deere, a barometer for the global economy, predicted a downturn in agriculture and construction equipment sales across all of its regions for the fiscal year ahead, validating analysts' concern that demand may have peaked for big industrial companies.
The company now expects 2024 net income between $ 7.75 billion and $ 8.25 billion, far below the consensus for $ 9.33 billion, according to LSEG data.
The heavy equipment maker's net income for the quarter rose to $ 2.37 billion, or $ 8.26 per share.
Despite beating Wall Street profit estimates, the manufacturer's stock slump mirrors peers such as Caterpillar that also outperformed forecasts. REUTERS

Demand for New Credit In the U.S. Has Declined
Demand for new credit in the United States over the last year has declined and will likely stay soft in the future, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve.
There was a "notable" decline in credit over the last year, with application rates at 41.2 percent, compared to 44.8 percent in 2022. But interest in applying for more credit card debt rose.
The report noted that expected decline extended to new credit cards, auto loans, mortgages and home refinancing. Respondents also see "significantly higher" prospects of future credit applications being turned down.
A report on total household debt levels during the third quarter found a 4.7 percent rise in overall credit card debt to $ 1.08 trillion, attributed to the strong economy and robust consumer spending. Credit costs have increased for borrowers on the back of aggressive interest rate hikes.

Toyota to Pay $ 60 Million For Lending Abuses
Toyota will pay $ 60 million to settle a U.S. regulator's charges that it illegally prevented car buyers from canceling unwanted bundles that increased their monthly loan payments and tarnished buyers' credit reports.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Monday said Toyota Motor Credit, based in Plano, Texas, will pay a $ 12 million civil fine and $ 48 million to car buyers harmed since 2016.
The "add-on" products, typically $ 700 to $ 2,500 per loan, provide protection when vehicles are damaged, stolen or out of warranty, and when car buyers die or become disabled.
Thousands of borrowers complained that dealers lied about whether these products were mandatory, or rushed paperwork so they would not realize how much they were paying. The regulator said Toyota Motor Credit made it "extremely cumbersome" to cancel the bundles. Reuters
MEDIA
Abu Dhabi Fund to Get Britain's Telegraph
An Abu Dhabi-backed investment fund said Monday it has paved the way to take ownership of Britain's Telegraph newspaper and The Spectator magazine after striking a deal with the publications' previous owners, Britain's Barclay family, to repay debts they owed.
RedBird IMI -- a joint venture between RedBird Capital, led by former CNN chief Jeff Zucker, and Abu Dhabi's International Media Investments -- said it has agreed to provide loans to the Barclay family and ensure their debts to Lloyds Bank are paid.
The Barclay family owned the right-leaning newspaper and magazine before they were put into receivership. The family also previously owned London's Ritz Hotel before selling it in 2020.
Earlier in the year, Lloyds Bank hired a restructuring specialist as receivers to control and help launch a sale process for the media business in order to repay debts worth some 1 billion pounds ( $ 1.25 billion). Associated Press

Members Of U.A.W. Back Deals With Big 3: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The United Automobile Workers union hopes the agreements with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis will help it make inroads at other companies.
Members of the United Automobile Workers union have given their backing to new contracts with the three big U.S. automakers, agreements that deliver hefty wage increases and other gains that had eluded the union for more than 20 years.
In the most closely contested vote, the tentative contract agreement at General Motors won the support of 55 percent of the nearly 36,000 members casting ballots, according to a tally from all the G.M. locals that the union posted on Thursday.
Tentative agreements with Ford Motor and Stellantis, the maker of brands including Jeep and Chrysler, appeared headed for approval by more decisive margins, nearly complete results there showed.
A spokesman for the union confirmed the accuracy of the tallies but declined to comment further.
The agreements are similar across the three automakers and raise the top wage for production workers 25 percent, to more than $ 40 over four and a half years, from $ 32. They were reached last month after a six-week wave of strikes that hobbled the companies -- a strategy spearheaded by the union's new president, Shawn Fain, who had vowed to take a more adversarial approach to negotiations than his predecessors.
The agreements appear to have quickly reverberated across the auto industry, with Toyota, Hyundai and Honda announcing significant wage increase at nonunion plants in the United States only days later.
"We call that the U.A.W. bump, and that stands for 'U Are Welcome,"' Mr. Fain said in testimony before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee this week. "And we're very proud of that. And when these workers decide to organize and join the U.A.W., they're going to realize the full benefit of union membership and get what they're fully due."
The new contracts also included larger company contributions to workers' retirement plans and the right to strike over plant closures. All three automakers declined to comment on the ratification votes.
Mr. Fain said the union was seeking to capitalize on its momentum by waging muscular organizing campaigns at nonunion plants, and, in remarks submitted to the Senate committee, he added that thousands of workers were already contacting the union and signing union cards.
But even Mr. Fain's tough approach in the talks with the Big Three did not yield terms attractive enough to many union members. G.M. workers at several large plants voted against the tentative agreement by large margins.
In contrast, members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters recently approved a new contract at United Parcel Service with 86 percent support, while a new contract between the Writers Guild of America and Hollywood studios passed with 99 percent support.
Rebecca Givan, a labor studies professor at Rutgers University, said Mr. Fain had achieved a major victory despite having taken office only a few months earlier with a goal of reorienting the union.
Dr. Givan said the union's approach of initially striking at one plant at each of the three automakers and ramping up over time had "really upended a lot of conventional wisdom" in the labor movement and had proved unusually successful at reversing some concessions that the union had accepted years earlier, like the suspension of a cost-of-living adjustment.
"This shows that if workers build enough power, they can win things back," she said.
U.A.W. members at Mack Truck also ratified a contract on Wednesday, after rejecting an initial agreement with the company.
Across the three automakers, skepticism toward the agreements arose in large part from veteran workers who felt that the proposed contracts did not go far enough to compensate them for years of concessions and weak wage growth, even given strong gains for newer workers. Wages for some newer workers will more than double over the next four years.
Huey Harris, a G.M. employee at a large truck assembly plant in Flint, Mich., who has worked at the company for over 20 years, said the deal should have gone further in rewarding veteran workers, though he ultimately voted for it. "The traditional people didn't think they were offered enough in the contract," he said.
Several longtime employees of the Big Three automakers said that even after the large gains of the new contract, they would not be making more than when they started their careers.
Curtis March, who works at Ford's Chicago Assembly Plant, said he made about $ 18 an hour once he reached the top wage for production workers at the company in the early 1990s, equivalent to more than $ 40 today when adjusted for inflation. He will make about $ 36 in the first year of the new contract.
Mr. March said the deal was likely to pass at Ford because it placated more recent employees, who outnumber veterans like him. Workers at his plant approved the deal after voting against several previous contracts.
Despite the ultimate success, the path to ratifying the contracts has included some internal strains for Mr. Fain and the union. Unite All Workers for Democracy, a reform group that played a key role in electing Mr. Fain and six other members of the U.A.W. executive board to their positions, declined to formally recommend that union members approve the contract even after Mr. Fain urged the group to do so at a recent meeting, according to three people familiar with the meeting. Instead, Unite All Workers passed a resolution committing it to stay neutral during the ratification vote, though it stated that the group "celebrates the record gains made in this agreement."
Two of these people also said the union's General Motors department had been less communicative and less proactive in distributing information about the contract to local union officials and members than the Ford and Stellantis departments.
The union declined to comment on these developments.
Ratification could also bring political benefits to President Biden, who waded into the negotiations over the summer and fall, and who risked angering business leaders by increasingly siding with the union's members.
Administration officials were taken aback in August when Mr. Fain called for a 40 percent raise for autoworkers and a four-day workweek. Executives at the Big Three called the White House to ask if Mr. Fain was serious. A senior administration official said Biden aides had reassured them that the union wanted a deal, but acknowledged that the negotiations could go quite differently from the way the automakers were used to.
In mid-September, when Mr. Biden was in New York for meetings at the United Nations General Assembly, he joined aides on a video call to make a decision that he and his team had been building toward for weeks: to join autoworkers on a picket line in Detroit. That decision infuriated executives, the administration official said, but the White House saw it as a victory for the president and for workers, by making a clear statement about where Mr. Biden stood in the negotiations.
Some autoworkers argued that the union had erred by failing to expand the strike, which eventually included about one-third of the companies' unionized workers in the United States, even more.
LaDonna Newman, another longtime Ford worker who opposed the contract because of its limited gains for veteran workers, said she believed the union could have won more at the bargaining table had it been willing to escalate further.
Still, she did not blame Mr. Fain for the outcome. "He walked into a burning building," Ms. Newman said. "I give him a lot of kudos for having the courage to go against the corporations."

In Public Causes, Kennedy Earns Acclaim, Criticism and a Fortune: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In 2021, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. earned more than $ 500,000 as the chairman and top lawyer at Children's Health Defense, the nonprofit organization that he has helped build into a leading spreader of anti-vaccine falsehoods and a platform for launching his independent bid for the White House.
The compensation was almost three times as high as the amount paid to the organization's president, but it was not Mr. Kennedy's biggest source of income. Neither was his family's fabled wealth. Instead, most of his earnings around the same time came from law firms -- a total of $ 7 million for lending them his name, connections and expertise to sue major companies.
Throughout his long public life, Mr. Kennedy has cultivated an image as a man committed to a greater good, the blessing and burden of belonging to one of America's most storied political families. Whether cleaning up rivers as an environmentalist or railing against the purported dangers of inoculations, he has said he is driven by his family's legacy of civic duty and sacrifice.
He built his presidential run around similar themes, even as his cousin dismissed the campaign as a "vanity project" and other relatives disavowed his beliefs. On the trail, Mr. Kennedy has delivered a populist message of anti-corporate rhetoric and debunked science while invoking a powerful lineage: his uncles, former President John F. Kennedy and Senator Ted Kennedy, and his father, Senator Robert F. Kennedy.
"RFK Jr. began a career of public services as soon as he passed the NY State Bar," reads one of the top lines on his campaign website.
In a 2018 book, he credited his mother, Ethel, for instilling important values. "She tried to give us the sense that we mustn't be satisfied with 'making a big pile for ourselves and whoever dies with the most stuff wins,"' Mr. Kennedy wrote. "Our lives, she taught us, should serve a higher purpose."
But an examination of Mr. Kennedy's finances by The New York Times, including public filings and almost two dozen interviews as well as tax returns and other documents not previously made public, showed that while he appears to believe in the causes he champions, they have also had a practical benefit: His crusades, backed by the power of his name, have earned him tens of millions of dollars.
Mr. Kennedy inherited many things from his family -- a charismatic presence, a gift for public speaking, a place among the nation's elite -- but not necessarily the kind of money that would support a life of both altruism and the trappings of wealth he seems to enjoy, The Times found. His grandfather, Joseph P. Kennedy, poured a fortune into trust funds for his descendants, helping to support the political ambitions of his sons. But Mr. Kennedy came into a relatively modest portion.
Behind much of his public career has been a relentless private hustle: board positions and advisory gigs, side deals with law firms, book contracts and an exhausting schedule of paid speeches, once upward of 60 a year by his own count.
While most people have to work, Mr. Kennedy did not always settle for the six-figure salary he was earning in positions with nonprofits. For decades, he has entwined his loftier missions with opportunities for enrichment. In addition to his salary at Children's Health Defense, for instance, he stands to profit personally from lawsuits, including against the pharmaceutical giant Merck over a common vaccine for children.
When Mr. Kennedy was still best known as an environmentalist, he met Alan Salzman, an investor in clean technology companies, and was intrigued: Mr. Kennedy wanted to find alternatives to carbon-based energy, "which I think is the biggest enemy to American democracy and the environment," he said in a 2012 deposition reviewed by The Times.
"And I also saw it as an opportunity to make some money for my family," he continued.
Mr. Kennedy would earn millions of dollars over at least eight years from work connected to Mr. Salzman's venture capital firm, VantagePoint, including promoting a project that other environmentalists opposed.
In an interview, Mr. Kennedy said that he was proud of giving his family a good life while promoting his causes.
"I have been able to use the various gifts I've been given -- education, the contacts and the value of a name that a generation in my family put a lot of effort into enhancing and retaining its value," he said. "I'm grateful that I've been given those gifts and that I am able to do well by doing good."
His campaign said in a statement that he had "never put a need or desire to make money ahead of his values and moral compass."
Recently, Mr. Kennedy's presidential bid has gained some traction. In a poll conducted last month by The Times and Siena College, 24 percent of voters in battleground states said they would support Mr. Kennedy in a theoretical matchup between him, President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump, the leading Republican candidate.
In the campaign, Mr. Kennedy has cast himself as an heir to his family's mystique. Yet what has at times looked from the outside like the glamorous life of a dynastic prince has occasionally been underwritten by others.
Wealthy friends were behind the purchase of the home Mr. Kennedy used on the family compound on Cape Cod, records show. He had an arrangement with a major environmental nonprofit group to pay for his children to accompany him on work trips, and he accepted a free Lexus as part of a promotional event for green vehicles.
"The Kennedys' wealth is inextricably intertwined with people's impression of the Kennedys -- and that isn't a surprise when you think their grandfather amassed one of America's biggest fortunes when his kids were young," said Fredrik Logevall, a historian at Harvard who is writing a two-volume biography of John F. Kennedy.
"But two generations later," Professor Logevall said, "some family members have more of the money than others."
A Grandfather's Wealth
Joseph Kennedy's estate, widely believed to be valued at roughly $ 500 million when he died in 1969 (about $ 4.2 billion in today's dollars), was left largely in trusts for his descendants.
Robert Kennedy had been assassinated the previous year while running for the Democratic nomination for president. He left half his estate to Ethel and divided the remainder equally among his children, according to documents filed in Manhattan Surrogate Court. But after an expensive campaign, he died with heavy debt, and more than half of his estate went to pay it off.
While the court documents put the senator's total estate at $ 1.6 million, there was more, shrouded in trusts whose value is not public. Still, disclosure forms Mr. Kennedy filed with the Federal Election Commission as part of his bid for the presidency, as well as other documents, provide some insight into his portion of the family wealth.
Mr. Kennedy owns between $ 4 million and $ 15 million in inherited assets, held in trusts -- the biggest, a stake in Wolf Point, a Chicago real estate development built on land his grandfather bought decades ago. Over the years, Mr. Kennedy has enjoyed large one-time distributions from his trust funds when assets were sold, according to bank records and public documents.
But the trusts do not tend to generate much steady income: He received between roughly $ 29,000 and $ 90,500 over a recent 18-month period, according to the F.E.C. filing. While certainly a boon, it is far from enough to finance Mr. Kennedy's lifestyle: At one point, a little over a decade ago, he estimated that his annual household expenses were $ 1.4 million.
"I have never gotten a lot of money from my family," Mr. Kennedy told The Times.
He said his biggest expense in recent years was his children's education. He drives, he said, a 1998 minivan. But he also lives with his wife, the actress Cheryl Hines, in a $ 6 million home in Brentwood, an affluent Los Angeles neighborhood.
Mr. Kennedy said that one reason his branch of the family never enjoyed the clan's presumed riches, in addition to his father's debt, is that he was one of 11 children, leaving him with less inherited money than other members of his generation. (When his cousin John F. Kennedy Jr. died in 1999, he left a $ 250,000 bequest to Mr. Kennedy.)
In the 2012 deposition, which Mr. Kennedy gave during his bitter divorce from his second wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy, he said Ethel Kennedy was "broke," and family members secretly helped cover her living expenses.
"Those of us who stay at her house pay her, and she doesn't know she's being paid," he said.
In the interview with The Times, Mr. Kennedy said that his mother, now 95, is no longer struggling financially.
A High-Flying Life
By the year 2000, after a bumpy early adulthood that included an arrest for heroin possession, Mr. Kennedy was a nationally recognized environmental lawyer. The previous year, he had been named a hero of the planet by Time magazine for his work with the Riverkeeper organization, among the groups credited with cleaning up New York's polluted Hudson River.
As a lawyer, he was on the payrolls of both the environmental litigation clinic at Pace University's law school and the Natural Resources Defense Council, where his salary was subsidized by Riverkeeper, according to a person familiar with the arrangement.
That year, Mr. Kennedy saw an opportunity that would eventually net him millions of dollars.
He co-founded a law firm, Kennedy & Madonna, with Kevin Madonna, a Pace Law graduate who had worked at the clinic. The firm allowed Mr. Kennedy to target polluters while profiting at a scale far beyond his nonprofit salaries. Kennedy & Madonna teamed up with other firms on class-action lawsuits against major corporations, including Dupont and the Southern California Gas Company, and took a cut of any proceeds.
Although Mr. Kennedy was listed first in the firm's name, he said in his 2012 divorce case that his partner dealt with most of the detailed legal work. Mr. Kennedy typically handled depositions and court appearances -- moments when his famous name and presence would have the strongest effect. Mr. Madonna declined to comment.
In 2002, Mr. Kennedy also forged a relationship with a personal-injury law firm in Pensacola, Fla. He was paid to do a radio show with one of the firm's partners, and was listed as "of counsel" at the firm, which did some class-action environmental litigation.
It was adding up to a good living, by most standards. By 2008, his jobs at the Florida firm and the nonprofits were bringing in about $ 400,000 a year. His trust funds and investments connected to his grandfather generated at least $ 150,000, according to his tax return.
Income from Kennedy & Madonna could be bumpy. For instance, from 2008 through 2010, the firm produced virtually no income, tax records show. But in 2011 Mr. Kennedy received $ 700,000, part of the firm's share of a legal settlement with Ford Motor.
Still, Mr. Kennedy was leading an expensive life between his home in Bedford, N.Y., a wealthy enclave north of Manhattan, where he lived with his wife and children, and the home he was using on Cape Cod. He bought the Bedford house in the 1980s, with financing from the sale of a luxury Manhattan apartment that a close family friend had willed to him, records show.
In 2010, Mr. Kennedy's household expenses reached $ 1.4 million. The mortgage and a home-equity loan on the Bedford property cost about $ 191,000. Memberships to a yacht club and other organizations ran him more than $ 14,000, while nannies and housekeepers cost more than $ 70,000. Pool maintenance was upward of $ 12,000. On top of those expenses, his assistant earned roughly $ 200,000.
His use of the home at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Mass., was made possible by wealthy friends, The Times found. It had been purchased by a lawyer with ties to Wendy Abrams, a Chicago-based philanthropist who has donated millions of dollars to environmental causes, including some of Mr. Kennedy's, records show.
In the interview, Mr. Kennedy said Ms. Abrams and her husband, whom he described as his closest friends, stepped in because he did not have enough money to buy the home when it came up for sale.
The house, a six-bedroom with traditional gray shingles, was bought in 2008 for $ 2.5 million. For years, Mr. Kennedy paid $ 4,000 a month in rent. The lease, which was reviewed by The Times, shows that he had an option to buy the home for the original purchase price, which he did in 2020.
The Abramses, Mr. Kennedy said in the deposition, had also footed the bill for a vacation to Jamaica for him; his then-girlfriend, Ms. Hines; and their respective children, while the Natural Resources Defense Council sometimes paid for his children to travel with him.
"All my vacations are paid for. So I just, I try not to spend money," Mr. Kennedy said in the deposition.
Ms. Abrams told The Times she commonly hosted friends in rented vacation homes. Mr. Kennedy said in his interview with The Times that his work for the N.R.D.C. could involve spending weeks in other countries, and the nonprofit agreed to pay for his children to travel to see him. The N.R.D.C. declined to comment.
Mr. Kennedy also accepted a free Lexus from Toyota, The Times found. He said he received the car when he helped the automaker promote charging stations for electric vehicles in California.
A Shadow Career
In addition to his jobs with nonprofits and his law firms, Mr. Kennedy turned to paid speeches as a big source of income. He said he could charge as much as $ 250,000 for a talk overseas, and at least $ 25,000 for others.
By the time he entered into divorce proceedings with Ms. Richardson Kennedy, he was on the road at a frenetic pace, at one point giving more than 60 speeches a year. (Ms. Richardson Kennedy died by suicide in 2012, before the divorce was final.)
If he wasn't around enough to put in a traditional workweek at any one organization, his name and natural charisma certainly raised their profiles and drew celebrities and deep-pocketed benefactors to their events, including the actors Pierce Brosnan, Alec Baldwin and Ms. Hines.
At the same time, Mr. Kennedy's high-profile environmental work opened the door to a lucrative shadow career as a corporate director and consultant. His reputation, experience and wide network of contacts had value: He could make introductions, offer advice or help secure financing.
A turning point had come in 2005. Mr. Kennedy gave a speech at the home of Mr. Salzman, the managing partner of VantagePoint Capital Partners, then one of California's most prominent venture capital firms. It was an early investor in Tesla, the electric carmaker, and was known for backing companies that were offering solutions to the planet's environmental problems.
Mr. Salzman hired Mr. Kennedy in 2007, initially paying him $ 100,000 a year to consult on potential investments. "He was obviously passionate about clean water, but also well-connected and very knowledgeable," Mr. Salzman told The Times.
In 2009 Mr. Kennedy became a partner, earning $ 340,000 at VantagePoint, in addition to his other sources of income. Two years later his salary had jumped to more than $ 750,000, records show.
Mr. Kennedy's position at VantagePoint led to other paying gigs at companies in which the fund had invested. For instance, he took in $ 80,000 a year from BrightSource, a developer of large-scale solar plants.
That work put him in conflict with environmentalists over two projects BrightSource was planning in California. The first was set for the Ivanpah Valley, in the desert near Nevada. A number of environmental groups opposed the idea, saying it threatened desert tortoises and vegetation.
Mr. Kennedy leaned on his contacts in the Obama administration to secure a $ 1.6 billion loan guarantee for the project in 2011. "I essentially saved the company," Mr. Kennedy said in the 2012 deposition.
BrightSource also wanted to locate a massive solar power farm in a region of the Mojave Desert, on land previously earmarked for conservation. David Myers, president of the Wildlands Conservancy, was among its most vocal opponents, along with Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who died this fall, and officials from the Sierra Club and the Center for Biological Diversity.
Mr. Myers said he had long admired Mr. Kennedy's work in New York and was devastated by his involvement in pushing the California project. "He was like a hero, in his own mind," Mr. Myers said. After a protracted fight, BrightSource walked away from the venture.
In the interview with The Times, Mr. Kennedy said he had sympathy for the point of view of the project's opponents, but he believed it was vital to promote solar energy.
Ultimately, Mr. Kennedy worked for or served on the boards of at least 16 companies, all while juggling his speaking commitments, his duties at the nonprofits that were paying him and his obligations to his law firm. He joined the board of a holding company that owned a troubled for-profit college in New York, was a paid adviser to an Arizona environmental company known for hiring boldface names and was on the board of a Florida company that made red-light cameras.
Mr. Kennedy ended up on the board of that company, Smart Citation Management, because a friend knew he was hard up for cash and recommended him for the position, he said in the 2012 deposition. George K. Stephenson, the president of Smart Citation, described Mr. Kennedy as a "very engaged" board member.
At least one company with ties to the Kennedy family still has Mr. Kennedy on its payroll. Marwood Group, a political research firm, has paid him $ 10,000 a month for years, records show.
Its president and founder is Ted Kennedy Jr., Mr. Kennedy's cousin. The company did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Kennedy said he served as an adviser and consultant.
A Shift to Vaccines
Around the time Mr. Kennedy spoke at Mr. Salzman's house, he became interested in another topic: mercury in vaccines.
For years, Mr. Kennedy had been warning about mercury contamination from coal-fired power plants, and he has said that concern grew to include vaccines when the mother of a "vaccine-injured child" came to him for help. In 2005 he wrote an article, published in Rolling Stone and Salon, that blamed thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative used in some vaccines, for a rise in autism in children.
Although both news outlets later withdrew the article after finding that some of its claims were wrong or dubious, and Mr. Kennedy was widely criticized by the scientific community, he dove headlong into his effort. He began giving speeches on the topic, and wrote a book about it in 2015. He did not give up his environmental work: That same year, he began taking about $ 200,000 in annual salary from Waterkeeper Alliance, a national organization with a mission to clean up waterways.
But he also joined the board of a nonprofit organization called the World Mercury Project, which aimed to eliminate mercury exposure in many arenas. In 2018, with Mr. Kennedy's help, it was rebranded as Children's Health Defense.
Mr. Kennedy proved to be an effective fund-raiser for the fledgling group, just as he had for his environmental allies, even selling $ 10 raffle tickets to win a tour of the Cape Cod compound. In 2021, the last year for which data is available, the group's annual revenue was almost $ 16 million. With an impressive war chest, Children's Health Defense has become one of the country's leading spreaders of vaccine misinformation.
As Mr. Kennedy's focus shifted more and more to vaccine skepticism, he parted ways with the environmental groups that had defined so much of his public life. In 2017 he told Tucker Carlson, then a Fox News host, that his vaccine work had made him a pariah in some circles and cost him work.
"It's been probably the worst career move that I've ever made," he said. When Mr. Carlson asked him if he was "getting paid for this," Mr. Kennedy replied: "No, I'm not. In fact, I'm getting unpaid for this."
Except for the Marwood Group, Mr. Kennedy no longer holds paid board positions, according to his F.E.C. filing, and he reported taking in a much-diminished $ 24,000 in speaking fees.
But his effort on vaccines has also been a source of income that would be impressive by many measures.
By 2021, the last full year for which data is available, he was making slightly more than $ 500,000 a year at Children's Health Defense, up from $ 255,000 in 2019.
After writing his book about thimerosal, he returned to his publisher, Skyhorse Publishing, to write a scathing book in 2021 about Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the federal government's long-serving top infectious disease specialist who became a focus of rage for people skeptical of the coronavirus vaccine.
The book sold well, more than 500,000 copies in hardcover, according to Circana BookScan. Mr. Kennedy said he donated the proceeds to Children's Health Defense, but he received a $ 125,000 consulting fee from the publisher over this year and last for referring other authors.
Similar to his playbook as an environmentalist, Mr. Kennedy has established profitable relationships with law firms, including one that handles legal work for Children's Health Defense. Mr. Kennedy told The Times that because he believed his stance on vaccines had cost him income, he had an agreement with Children's Health Defense to supplement his salary with outside legal work.
"I had these big bills that I just couldn't pay on a badly diminished salary," he told The Times.
"I said, 'I need an opportunity to make more because that is not going to do it,"' Mr. Kennedy said. Under the deal, he would share the proceeds from any legal wins or settlements with the organization.
One firm, the California-based Wisner Baum, paid him $ 1.6 million over the 18 months ending in June, according to his F.E.C. filing. Over the years, he has worked on environmental cases for Wisner Baum, including as a lawyer on the team that won a $ 290 million judgment against the chemical giant Monsanto, the maker of Roundup weed killer.
More recently, however, Mr. Kennedy has been listed as co-counsel on dozens of lawsuits that Wisner Baum has brought against the pharmaceutical company Merck for injuries it says were caused by a vaccine formulated to prevent the transmission of human papillomavirus.
The Children's Health Defense website also scouts clients for Wisner Baum, encouraging parents to call the firm if they believe their child might have been harmed by the HPV vaccine.
Another law firm, JW Howard Attorneys, paid Mr. Kennedy about $ 315,000 over the same 18-month period. JW Howard was one of the firms that handled a case brought by the Orange County Board of Education and Children's Health Defense seeking to end the Covid-19 state of emergency that California declared in the spring of 2020.
And this past January, JW Howard was counsel on a lawsuit filed by Children's Health Defense and Mr. Kennedy against The Washington Post, Reuters and other news organizations, accusing them of colluding to stop the publication of certain Covid stories, among other allegations.
Mr. Kennedy is also still a partner at Kennedy & Madonna. Between January 2022 and June 2023, he made $ 5 million for his work there, records show. The law firm, its website has emphasized, does not take vaccine cases.

Long-Timers Are Resisting G.M. Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Many longstanding General Motors workers have been voting against the tentative accord, which they feel insufficiently improves retirement benefits.
A United Automobile Workers union vote on a tentative contract agreement with General Motors that provides record wage increases has run into unexpectedly strong resistance from veteran workers.
Voting at most union locals has been completed and the final result, due as early as Thursday evening, will very likely be decided by a narrow margin. A majority of workers at several large plants in Michigan, Indiana and Tennessee rejected the contract, though union members at a large sport utility plant in Arlington, Texas, voted in favor of it.
G.M., Ford Motor and Stellantis agreed to similar contracts with the union after U.A.W. members went on strike at select plants and warehouses. Workers walked off the job at the first three plants on Sept. 15 and stayed on strike for more than 40 days. It was the first time the union has struck all three automakers at the same time, though it did not shut down all of the factories of any company.
The agreement appears to be headed for ratification at Ford and Stellantis, the maker of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram vehicles, by comfortable margins, according to running tallies the U.A.W. published online.
At G.M., many veteran workers have opposed the contract because they want the company to contribute more money to retirement plans and the cost of health care for retirees.
"I've heard from some traditional workers who said there wasn't enough in there for them," said David Green, director of the U.A.W. Region 2B, which includes Ohio, Indiana and a small part of Michigan. He voted for the contract.
David Miller, a 20-year G.M. veteran who works at a big truck assembly plant in Flint, Mich., said the absence of retiree health benefits was the reason he had voted no. "I'm not voting yes on any contract that doesn't have that in it because I don't need the health care when I'm 25 -- I'm 65," he said. "I'm at the mercy of Medicare."
General Motors declined to comment on the contract vote.
The tentative contract raises the top wage by 25 percent, from $ 32 to more than $ 40 over four and a half years. The increase is more than the combined wage increases the union has won over the past 22 years, according to U.A.W. officials.
Newer hires who are lower on the pay scale will see larger increases that take them to the new top wage. And workers who were recently hired will see their hourly pay double.
The agreement also provides for cost-of-living adjustments that will nudge wages higher if inflation persists as well as enhanced company contributions to pensions and retirement plans, more paid time off and the ability to strike if any plant is closed during the term of the contract.
To be ratified, the agreement must secure a simple majority. More than 46,000 U.A.W. workers work at G.M., although not all of them are likely to turn in ballots. More than 14,000 company employees took part in the targeted strikes.
As of Wednesday afternoon, an online vote tally that the union maintains showed that just over 54 percent of the votes were in favor of the contract, but that tally did not include numbers from some big plants.
If the tentative agreement is voted down, it will represent a big setback for the U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, who was elected this year and promised to take a more aggressive approach in the contract talks in hopes of winning significant pay increases and reversing some of the concessions the union accepted in past contracts.
He appeared to deliver that in what was widely regarded as a record deal. President Biden, who joined striking workers on the picket line in September at a G.M. site in Belleville, Mich., hailed Mr. Fain's efforts. The president joined Mr. Fain last week at a plant in Belvidere, Ill., that Stellantis agreed to keep open after halting production this year.
"I don't think it diminishes Shawn Fain's luster that much because of a close ratification vote," said Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. "It just means expectations were high, and had he not delivered as much as he did, it wouldn't have passed."
After the contracts with the three Detroit automakers are ratified, Mr. Fain hopes to try to organize workers at nonunion plants in the South owned by Toyota, Honda and other foreign automakers, and the nonunion plants that Tesla operates in California and Texas.
Since the terms of the U.A.W. agreements were announced, some of those companies have increased wages of factory workers. Toyota has told workers that it will raise hourly rates by 9 percent in January. Honda and Hyundai will lift wages 11 percent and 14 percent next year. Hyundai plans to increase wages 25 percent by 2028.
"Everybody at those companies should say, 'Thank you, U.A.W.,"' Mr. Wheaton said. "Those increases wouldn't have happened without the new U.A.W. contract."

Behind Rise of Catalytic Converter Crime Rings: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One morning in September, a truck disgorged its load of pulverized rock with a resounding bang inside Stillwater Mining's metallurgical plant north of Yellowstone National Park.
The mined ore contains platinum, palladium and rhodium, three of the earth's rarest, most expensive metals -- and vital components in the millions of catalytic converters that reduce polluting emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles.
At the opposite end of the plant was another batch of metal, not from the mine but from used catalytic converters ground into powder for recycling. The new and the old metals would later be blended under intense heat, then shipped to a refinery.
Recycling catalytic converters costs less than mining the ore. But it carries a risk, as Stillwater discovered after paying more than $ 170 million for used ones, many of them stolen, according to an indictment handed up this spring on Long Island that implicated the mine. Stillwater was not charged and denied knowing the devices were stolen.
The indictment is an outgrowth of a billion-dollar epidemic of catalytic converter thefts that has not only disabled vehicles but also involved dozens of shootings, truck hijackings and other violence. Replacement devices are often hard to get and can cost $ 1,000 or more.
Despite public attention on the thefts, little has been known about where the stolen metal goes, who benefits or why stopping the thievery has proved so difficult.
An examination of business records and social media posts, as well as interviews with more than 80 officials on three continents who have ties to the industry, showed that the stolen devices pass through middlemen, smelters and refineries in the United States and overseas. Along the way, their provenance becomes opaque, leaving beneficiaries of the thefts with plausible deniability and little incentive to stop them.
During processing, the metal is blended with legitimate supplies from mines and scrapyards, The New York Times found, before being sold primarily to companies that make catalytic converters for automakers, as well as pharmaceutical companies for cancer and other drugs, military contractors for weapons production, and banks for their precious-metals trading desks, among others.
By then, it is nearly impossible to separate what's legal from what's not.
Banks provide short-term financing to process the metals, while other lightly regulated lenders, sometimes called "shadow bankers," step in when the big banks won't, Mark Williams, a former Federal Reserve Bank examiner, said in an interview.
Quantifying the thefts is difficult, and estimates vary widely. About 6 percent of the 12 million catalytic converters recycled each year are believed to have been stolen, with the rest coming from scrapyards and other legitimate sources, according to Howard Nusbaum, administrator of the National Salvage Vehicle Reporting Program, a nonprofit group that works closely with law enforcement.
That low percentage is little comfort to the owners of the roughly 600,000 cars whose devices, sometimes known as cats or autocats, were swiped last year. The commercial appetite for the three metals, called platinum group metals or PGMs, has been insatiable.
In an indictment last year involving an auto shop in New Jersey, the shop was accused of selling stolen converters to an unnamed, unindicted co-conspirator, which people with knowledge of the indictment identified as Dowa Metals and Mining America, a Japanese-owned smelter that calls itself "a gateway into the world of PGM metal recycling for North and South America."
A Dowa spokesman said in a statement that the company "has done nothing wrong and that any allegation to the contrary is false."
A cottage industry of enablers has grown up around the market. To help thieves assess where and when to strike, the New Jersey auto shop sold access to apps that transmitted up-to-the-minute prices of the metals along with the estimated value of catalytic converters from different vehicles.
"That made it easier for thieves who otherwise would just be slinging dope on a corner to just pull out their phone and be like, 'Oh, look, there's a Prius parked across the street -- I wonder how much I can get for that?"' said the lead federal prosecutor on a recent indictment.
The thieves have cast a wide net. A Bimbo Bakery delivery truck was hit in New Castle, Del., as were a Mr. Ding-A-Ling Ice Cream truck in Latham, N.Y., and 36 school buses over a single weekend in one Connecticut community. Amy Foote, an opera singer in the San Francisco Bay Area, said 11 of the devices had been stolen from her Toyota Prius. She called the car "a vending machine for catalytic converters."
Authorities have dismantled several nationwide criminal rings trafficking in the devices and many states have introduced new laws. But the thefts continue, even as prices for the metal have dipped.
The subject arose repeatedly at a recent conference of the International Precious Metals Institute in Orlando. Lee Hockey, a consultant formerly with Johnson Matthey, a specialty chemical company, addressed culpability head on.
"Most people in this room will see petty thefts and say, 'Oh, we're not involved in that,"' Mr. Hockey said. "But everybody is. If you're a refiner, even if you are dealing with a smelter, you are getting the metal, so you are liable. If you are an insurance company and you are insuring people on the site, you are liable. If you are doing an analysis of the sample, you are liable." He added, "You are along the supply chain, and you are involved."
Greg Roset, a former manager of Stillwater's recycling program in Montana, answered unequivocally when asked in an interview if he ever worried about stolen metal entering the supply.
"Yes," he said, "always."
How It All Began
The frenzy over grimy metal casings underneath cars traces back to a barren strip of rocky land in South Africa's so-called Platinum Belt.
For more than 100 years, gold reigned supreme in that country but by 2005, a confluence of events, set off partly by the auto industry, had deposed gold in favor of PGMs.
In the 1960s, as concern in the United States mounted over worsening air quality, environmentalists pointed to millions of cars belching toxic fumes from their tailpipes. Smog blanketed many major American cities.
In response, Congress passed the Clean Air Act of 1970, which included a provision requiring all vehicles manufactured after 1975 to sharply reduce pollutants. Automakers objected, saying it was not technologically possible.
But researchers at Engelhard Corporation, a metals processing company in New Jersey, found that platinum group metals could catalyze, or convert, unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides into less harmful forms. To be effective, the catalysts had to be durable, have a high melting point and resist corrosion.
Engelhard coated a ceramic honeycomb screen with a thin layer of PGMs and placed it inside a metal container through which the engine exhaust passed.
"It stands as one of the greatest technological interventions to protect the environment in history," said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization.
As an added benefit, the precious metals are recyclable. A single converter contains only a small amount, but with millions of cars on the road, all that rare metal being recycled only from scrapyards struck some people as a lost opportunity.
And so, a thriving underground network of thieves took root.
Follow the Metals
On a cold day in March 2022, DG Auto issued an urgent phone alert: "Palladium breaks $ 2,900, reaching its highest price since June 2021." Noting that prices on average had risen 15 percent the week before, the company suggested downloading its app "to make sure you're getting the best price for your converter."
DG Auto also showed an interest in international affairs. "Metal prices are moving as China's lockdowns ease up," the company texted customers. "Shanghai is slowly reopening and Beijing lockdown is not likely."
In an industrial park in Freehold, N.J., less than a half-mile from a state vehicle inspection station, DG Auto became one of the nation's biggest buyers and sellers of stolen catalytic converters, according to the authorities.
Customers who paid $ 29 a month for its "platinum package" could submit pictures of the devices for estimates, along with other services.
In the indictment last year, a federal grand jury accused DG Auto of selling stolen converters to the unindicted co-conspirator, identified to The Times as Dowa Metals and Mining America.
"Our strength is in our ability to collect spent catalysts by ourselves, which enables us to obtain market information with relative ease," Akira Sekiguchi, Dowa's president, told investors last year.
At the time, Dowa was part owner of a metal-testing company, Nippon PGM America, along with Tanaka and Toyota Tsusho America, a unit of Toyota Motors, according to Nippon's website. Neither Tanaka nor Toyota were mentioned in the indictment or accused of wrongdoing. In a statement, Tanaka said there was "no direct contractual relationship" between it and Dowa.
Last month, three people pleaded guilty to their role in the nationwide conspiracy to ship $ 600 million of stolen catalytic converters from California to DG Auto. Five co-defendants have pleaded not guilty.
Best practices for the industry emphasize buying autocats from known, reputable suppliers that can trace the devices' origins. Even so, stolen converters enter the supply chain.
Experienced auto theft investigators prefer to focus on companies buying the metals. Joseph Boche, a former director of the International Association of Auto Theft Investigators, said the thefts would mostly stop if basic rules were followed nationally: identify the person selling the device and the vehicle from which it was removed, require traceable payment, prohibit cash transactions, and maintain sales records.
But support has been uneven, he said. In the spring of 2021, a group of smelters and refiners contacted him to combat the thefts. "But they didn't like any of my suggestions," he said, "and stopped inviting me to any of their meetings."
The Montana Mine
Montana is one of the few places in the world where the metals used in catalytic converters are mined. Extracting the deposits is costly, requiring twin tunnels dug 3.5 miles underground.
To augment its supply, Stillwater began buying catalytic converters for recycling, a cheaper method and less harmful to the environment.
"Blending materials from two different sources gives us a competitive advantage over other recycling facilities," the company website states. "Our Montana mines contain quantities of nickel and copper which facilitate extraction of the PGMs from the recycled material."
Over the past decade, the Stillwater plant processed more PGMs from the used devices than from its Montana mines, Heather McDowell, a company official, said during a recent tour. To keep the pipeline of recycled devices flowing, she said, Stillwater relies on 28 suppliers.
All of the PGMs are sent for final refining to Johnson Matthey for use in, among other things, "the vital compounds -- known as active pharmaceutical ingredients," it said in its 2021 annual report.
Pfizer, for example, uses platinum for chemotherapy treatments. "Pfizer has a diverse supply chain network and has not relied on a sole supplier," the company said in an email response to questions from The Times about Stillwater. The company declined to say whether Stillwater is one of those suppliers.
When Stillwater needed to prime the pump, it advanced cash to "third-party brokers and suppliers to support the purchase and collection of spent autocatalytic materials," the company wrote in a regulatory filing.
In the past, those payments totaled in the tens of millions of dollars, court records show.
For other companies, lenders step in with short-term financing, according to industry documents and interviews with five precious-metals experts. Some loans are used to buy catalytic converters to "keep the wheels spinning" on the recycling business, one precious-metals executive said.
JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs provide short-term financing for metal processors, according to Ruth Crowell, chief executive of the London Bullion Market Association, a trade group that sets standards for the precious-metals industry. JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs did not respond to requests for comment; a spokesman for Morgan Stanley declined to discuss lending practices.
In an 81-count indictment in Nassau County, N.Y., this spring, prosecutors said Stillwater had paid an accused criminal operation more than $ 170 million for catalytic converters, many of them stolen. The indictment charged two brothers, Alan and Andrew Pawelsky, with orchestrating the thefts and using the proceeds of their Stillwater sales to buy more stolen devices.
The brothers deny the accusations, and court records show that Stillwater cut ties with them last December when their alleged criminal activity became public. Stillwater denied knowing the devices were stolen and said it was now setting the industry standard by requiring vendors to "undergo a robust diligence review."
In court papers, Alan Pawelsky acknowledged that his company, Ace Auto Recycling, had a "lucrative contract" with Stillwater, which allowed it to "become a broker in the industry for others that had large volumes of cats."
In a statement, Gerald M. Cohen, a lawyer for Mr. Pawelsky, described him as "a hard-working American success story who went out of his way to comply with the law, avoided buying stolen materials and was always willing to assist law enforcement."
Stillwater has also been a business partner with Global Refining Group, a family of companies that includes Alpha Recycling in the Bronx and Alpha Shredding Group in New Jersey, according to Global's website. Both firms were implicated in other investigations related to the purchase of stolen material, according to court records.
Justin Mercer, a lawyer representing Global Refining, said in an interview that his client sourced material only from responsible suppliers and in recent years had "doubled down on compliance." But, he acknowledged, such steps only "reduce the likelihood" of taking in stolen goods.
The former Stillwater recycling manager, Mr. Roset, said it would be "naïve to believe that nothing ever sneaks into the system," because the network is so large. For companies like Stillwater, he said, "There's no way to determine the origin of the metal. But the collectors -- it's on them to have integrity."
Shootings and Stabbings
Darren Almendarez, a sheriff's deputy in Harris County, Texas, had recently begun investigating catalytic converter thefts in the Houston area in March 2022 when he spotted three men attempting to steal the one from his own Toyota Tundra.
Though off duty, he confronted the men in a grocery parking lot. A gun battle ensued, and Mr. Almendarez was killed.
The thefts have brought about a wave of violence that speaks to the value of the metals inside the devices. Since 2021, there have been almost four dozen shootouts, in addition to stabbings and countless fistfights.
Victims of the thefts cut across social and economic lines.
In the summer of 2021, thieves snatched seven from Silver Key Senior Services, which provides transportation for elderly and developmentally disabled people in Colorado Springs, Colo. In May, more devices were stolen from their vehicles and from two partner organizations. Replacements cost roughly $ 40,000.
Ms. Foote, the Bay Area opera singer who had 11 stolen from her Prius, said that for a while it happened at least once a month.
She had a protective plate installed, but thieves cut around it. Other solutions suggested by the police included getting the device engraved, which seemed pointless to her.
"The people selling the cats don't care," Ms. Foote said.
The Prius is a popular target because of its high PGM content. With so many Prius owners seeking replacements, wait times in some parts of the country have stretched up to a year.
All told, about 24 percent of all PGMs come through the recycling of catalytic converters, according to Braeton J. Smith, an economist at the Department of Energy.
An International Problem
Some countries are experiencing a different kind of criminality: the hijacking of entire truckloads of new catalytic converters. In February, robbers nabbed a truck in southern Germany with a load worth $ 1.5 million.
South Africa, in particular, has experienced escalating violence, Julian Kohle, government affairs manager with the International Platinum Group Metals Association, wrote in a recent article for the group.
He cited an incident in which gangs had shot a guard and taken about $ 2.5 million in precious metals from a truck in Port Elizabeth. A South African business group blamed international organized crime syndicates that jam security and tracking devices, he wrote.
Experts say the first step to stopping precious-metal thefts is to demonstrate the true scale of the crime.
American news reports often cite claims data from the National Insurance Crime Bureau, which recorded 64,000 catalytic converter thefts last year. But that number does not include thefts reported to the police, devices stolen from uninsured vehicles, or even all insurance claims, according to the National Salvage Vehicle Reporting Program.
"Lots of people don't file claims because there's a $ 500 deductible," said Mr. Nusbaum, the group's administrator. He added that many insurers don't have a separate reporting category for this crime. His organization estimates that there are more than 10 times as many thefts annually as the insurance group's tally.
The insurance bureau's president, David Glawe, acknowledged in a statement that his most recent data was "just a snapshot of an underreported crime."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
COLUMBUS, Mont. — One morning in September, a truck disgorged its load of pulverized rock with a resounding bang inside Stillwater Mining’s metallurgical plant north of Yellowstone National Park.
The mined ore contains platinum, palladium and rhodium, three of the Earth’s rarest, most expensive metals — and vital components in the millions of catalytic converters that reduce polluting emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles.
At the opposite end of the plant was another batch of metal, not from the mine but from used catalytic converters ground into powder for recycling. The new and the old metals would later be blended under intense heat, then shipped to a refinery.
Recycling catalytic converters costs less than mining the ore. But it carries a risk, as Stillwater discovered after paying more than $170 million for used ones, many of them stolen, according to an indictment handed up this spring on Long Island, New York, that implicated the mine. Stillwater was not charged and denied knowing the devices were stolen.
The indictment is an outgrowth of a billion-dollar epidemic of catalytic converter thefts that has not only disabled vehicles but also involved dozens of shootings, truck hijackings and other violence. Replacement devices are often hard to get and can cost $1,000 or more.
Despite public attention on the thefts, little has been known about where the stolen metal goes, who benefits or why stopping the thievery has proved so difficult.
An examination of business records and social media posts, as well as interviews with more than 80 officials on three continents who have ties to the industry, showed that the stolen devices pass through middlemen, smelters and refineries in the United States and overseas. Along the way, their provenance becomes opaque, leaving beneficiaries of the thefts with plausible deniability and little incentive to stop them.
During processing, the metal is blended with legitimate supplies from mines and scrapyards, The New York Times found, before being sold primarily to companies that make catalytic converters for automakers, as well as pharmaceutical companies for cancer and other drugs, military contractors for weapons production, and banks for their precious-metals trading desks, among others.
By then, it is nearly impossible to separate what’s legal from what’s not.
Banks provide short-term financing to process the metals, while other lightly regulated lenders, sometimes called “shadow bankers,” step in when the big banks won’t, Mark Williams, a former Federal Reserve Bank examiner, said in an interview.
Quantifying the thefts is difficult, and estimates vary widely. About 6% of the 12 million catalytic converters recycled each year are believed to have been stolen, with the rest coming from scrapyards and other legitimate sources, according to Howard Nusbaum, administrator of the National Salvage Vehicle Reporting Program, a nonprofit group that works closely with law enforcement.
That low percentage is little comfort to the owners of the roughly 600,000 cars whose devices, sometimes known as cats or autocats, were swiped last year. The commercial appetite for the three metals, called platinum group metals or PGMs, has been insatiable.
In an indictment last year involving an auto shop in New Jersey, the shop was accused of selling stolen converters to an unnamed, unindicted co-conspirator, which people with knowledge of the indictment identified as Dowa Metals and Mining America, a Japanese-owned smelter that calls itself “a gateway into the world of PGM metal recycling for North and South America.”
A Dowa spokesperson said in a statement that the company “has done nothing wrong and that any allegation to the contrary is false.”
A cottage industry of enablers has grown up around the market. To help thieves assess where and when to strike, the New Jersey auto shop sold access to apps that transmitted up-to-the-minute prices of the metals along with the estimated value of catalytic converters from different vehicles.
The thieves have cast a wide net. A Bimbo Bakery delivery truck was hit in New Castle, Delaware, as were a Mr. Ding-A-Ling Ice Cream truck in Latham, New York, and 36 school buses over a single weekend in one Connecticut community. Amy Foote, an opera singer in the San Francisco Bay Area, said 11 of the devices had been stolen from her Toyota Prius. She called the car “a vending machine for catalytic converters.”
The frenzy over grimy metal casings underneath cars traces back to a barren strip of rocky land in South Africa’s so-called Platinum Belt.
For more than 100 years, gold reigned supreme in that country but by 2005, a confluence of events, set off partly by the auto industry, had deposed gold in favor of PGMs.

Ukraine Indicts 3 Linked to Efforts to Investigate the Bidens: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Three officials were accused of operating at the behest of Russian intelligence when they aligned with efforts by Rudolph W. Giuliani to tie the Biden family to corruption in Ukraine.
Ukrainian police and prosecutors have accused two politicians and a former prosecutor of treason, saying they colluded with a Russian intelligence agency in aiding an effort by Rudolph W. Giuliani several years ago to tie the Biden family to corruption in Ukraine.
Those accused include Kostyantyn Kulyk, a former Ukrainian deputy prosecutor general who had drafted a memo in 2019 suggesting Ukraine investigate Hunter Biden, President Biden's son, for his role serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.
Also implicated were a current member of Ukraine's Parliament, Oleksandr Dubinsky, and a former member, Andriy Derkach, who had publicly advocated for an investigation in Ukraine into Hunter Biden. They had also promoted a spurious theory that it was Ukraine, and not Russia, that had meddled in the 2016 presidential election in the United States.
The three were indicted on charges of treason and belonging to a criminal organization. The charges refer to "information-subversive activities" and focus on actions in 2019 before the American presidential election. They do not say if or when the activity stopped.
In the run-up to the 2020 election in the United States, Mr. Giuliani and later former President Donald J. Trump had encouraged Ukrainian officials to follow up on the allegations against Hunter Biden. The effort included a phone call by Mr. Trump to President Volodymyr Zelensky in July of 2019 urging an investigation into the Bidens, at a time when the Trump administration was withholding military aid for the Ukrainian Army.
Critics say that pressure to investigate the Bidens was politically motivated, aimed at harming the elder Mr. Biden's chances against Mr. Trump in the 2020 presidential election.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani denied that there was anything inappropriate about their contact with Ukrainian officials, with Mr. Trump describing his phone call to Mr. Zelensky as "perfect." The administration said military aid to Ukraine was withheld over concerns about corruption in the Ukrainian government.
The events led to Mr. Trump's first impeachment in the House of Representatives. He was acquitted in the Senate.
Ukrainian media on Tuesday suggested the indictments, too, had a political component for Mr. Zelensky: that they were intended to send a signal to Mr. Biden now, as his administration is pressing Congress for military assistance to Ukraine, that Kyiv will root out accused Russian agents, including those who had promoted accusations against his family.
In statements released on Monday, Ukrainian police and the country's domestic intelligence agency said all three men were members of a spy network established inside the Ukrainian government and handled by Russia's military intelligence agency, known as the G.R.U.
The intelligence agency's statement said the Russians paid members of the group $ 10 million. An aide to Mr. Derkach, Ihor Kolesnikov, was detained earlier and convicted on treason charges.
Two members of the group, Mr. Derkach and Mr. Kulyk, fled Ukraine after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, the statement said. Mr. Dubinsky was remanded to pretrial detention in a Ukrainian jail on Tuesday.
Mr. Dubinsky, in a statement posted on the social networking site Telegram, said that the prosecutors had "not presented one fact" to support the accusations, and that the charges were retribution for criticizing Mr. Zelensky's government in his role as a member of Parliament. He said that he testified a year and a half ago as a witness in a treason investigation of Mr. Derkach but at the time had not been accused of any wrongdoing.
Mr. Dubinsky was expelled from Mr. Zelensky's political party, Servant of the People, in 2021 after the United States sanctioned him for meddling in the American political process.
The Ukrainian intelligence agency's statement said that Mr. Kulyk had used his position in the prosecutor general's office to promote investigations that worked "in favor of the Kremlin," without specifying any cases.
In late 2018, Mr. Kulyk compiled a seven-page dossier asserting that Ukrainian prosecutors had evidence that "may attest to the commission of corrupt actions aimed at personal unlawful enrichment by former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden," according to a copy leaked by a Ukrainian blogger.
The dossier suggested that Mr. Biden, when he had served as vice president, had tried to quash a corruption investigation into the natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, where his son served on the board. Former colleagues of Mr. Kulyk at the prosecutor's office confirmed he had written the document, which helped set in motion an effort by Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Mr. Giuliani, and other supporters to press for an investigation in Ukraine.
In a phone call with Mr. Zelensky that became central to the impeachment case, Mr. Trump had asked the Ukrainian president to investigate supposed conflicts of interest by Mr. Biden when he was vice president, according to White House notes of the call. Mr. Trump denied he had linked military aid to Ukraine to the investigation of the Biden family.
Allegations of corruption and ties to Russia had trailed Mr. Kulyk for years in the Ukrainian media and among anti-corruption watchdog groups before he compiled the dossier.
In 2016, he was indicted in Ukraine on charges of illegal enrichment for owning apartments and cars that seemed beyond the means of his modest official salary. One car, a Toyota Land Cruiser, had been bought by the father of a military commander fighting on the Russian side in the war in eastern Ukraine.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Silhouetted against the predawn light of the West Texas sky, a group of oil field workers got ready for the tough job ahead on a September day -- cleaning up a spill on a rig outside of Odessa -- speaking a mix of English and Spanish.
All 80 employees of their company, Premier Energy Services, are Hispanic, reflecting a shift that has slowly transformed Texas' oil-rich western expanse. Where a roughneck -- the grease-stained symbol of Texas' economic identity -- was once typically a white man hoping to strike black gold, the average oil field worker is now a Hispanic man who was born in Texas.
"Growing up, my dad used to take me to work in the oil fields. It was a white man's industry," said a foreman, Alfredo Ramirez, 31, a third-generation Mexican American. "Today it is us Latinos."
Mark Matta, a city councilman in Odessa, chuckled as he described a television series about a Texas oil rig in which most of the workers were white. "That show flipped our reality," he said.
Understanding the reality of Texas matters. With a population of over 30 million, Texas is increasingly shaping the cultural and political direction of the country. Its economy is one of the largest in the world, growing faster than the nation's as a whole.
The state has long been defined by demographic change, particularly its growing Hispanic population. But the nature of those changes, and how profound they have become, has often been misunderstood, even by those who follow the state closely.
The New York Times collected years of census data, analyzed migration patterns and traveled to communities across Texas to understand what is happening in the nation's second most populous state, a place that offers an important window into the future of both national politics and the attempts to deal with questions of identity and diversity.
What stood out was the degree to which Texas already has become a state of immigrants, a population that is now multigenerational.
The fastest growing demographic group is made up of the children of immigrants, predominantly Texas-born Hispanics. That means that white people, who had long been the state's largest demographic group, are now outnumbered by those who are Hispanic, even among native-born Texans, a change first documented by the U.S. Census Bureau this year.
A visitor to the state 30 years ago would have encountered two born-and-bred white Texans for every Latino born on Texas soil. Today, those groups are of nearly equal size.
"Few in my family speak Spanish," said Shawn Rodriquez, whose ancestors came from Mexico to Odessa, where he now owns an oil field services company. "Our ancestry is from right here in Texas."
Texas has also been a magnet for people moving from other states, a fact celebrated by its Republican leaders, including Gov. Greg Abbott, who boast of luring businesses away from California and New York to their state's lower taxes, cheaper housing and more conservative politics.
But because Texas is so populous, migration has less of an effect than it does on other fast-growing states, like Nevada and Arizona. And the composition of these domestic migrants is often misconstrued. While white professionals are indeed moving to Austin, the state is gaining two people of color for every white migrant.
Newcomers from other states are reshaping the suburbs in surprising ways. Take Frisco outside of Dallas. The city has seen an influx of white transplants to new developments on tracts of farmland. But a huge number of Asians have also moved in.
In 1990, when around 6,000 people lived in Frisco, the census listed just 29 Asian residents. Now, nearly a quarter of the city's 220,000 residents are Asian.
Texas also leads the nation in the growth of its Black population, surpassing Georgia and Florida. And unlike Black transplants to other states, who are often either poor or rich, those coming to Texas are more likely to be middle class, census data shows. In Houston, Black-owned businesses have been thriving, with the city now rivaling Atlanta as a destination for Black families and young people.
"Everyone is coming to Houston," said Victoria Walsh, 30, who moved from New Orleans for a restaurant job in 2018. "There's a whole lot of jobs, a whole lot of new concepts, a new pop-up each week."
The trends have already affected the state's politics, and are likely to continue to do so. In Odessa, where the Latino share of the local population has nearly doubled to 56 percent since 1990, the mayor is still a conservative Republican, but for the first time, he is Hispanic.
Democrats have seen their margins of defeat shrink. This is happening not just in cities, where Democrats often now dominate, but also in various other areas with a large number of Texas-born Hispanics. Still, demographic changes alone will not guarantee victory for the party, as polls have found that a growing number of nonwhite voters may be up for grabs.
Republicans, recognizing the changes, have courted conservative Hispanics and have seen some recent electoral successes, particularly in the Rio Grande Valley.
For many Americans outside the state, Texas' identity is quickly conjured: Cowboys and football. Guns and oil. Pickup trucks and Waylon Jennings.
In reality, it is a complex mixture: The Dallas suburbs recently hosted a professional cricket league, attracting thousands of screaming fans, and welcomed the return of a refurbished 1950s country music dance hall.
"The identity of being a Texan has changed completely," said Ray Benson, a long-ago transplant from Pennsylvania whose western swing band, Asleep at the Wheel, played at the dance hall's reopening. "I came to Texas to become a Texan. But now I think more people moving to Texas just bring whatever their culture was before."
In reporting trips over miles and miles of Texas, to borrow a phrase from a classic song, The Times found a broad range of Texans, settling in a few representative places -- a North Texas suburb, the roughneck hub of Odessa and the heart of Houston -- to tell the story of a state in rapid transition.
Frisco: A Landing Pad for Transplants
Heather Eastburn and her husband were living in Los Angeles but after having children, they needed more space and decided to relocate to Frisco, Texas, near where her husband, a Republican wealth manager, was from.
Ms. Eastburn had doubts.
"People would tell me, 'oh, you're going to have a good life there. It's an easy life,"' she recalled. "And I was like, what does that mean?"
After the move, she discovered what they meant. The schools were good. Everything was new, down to the shopping carts at the grocery store. "It was like I was pushing a Cadillac around in the Kroger instead of fighting with something like you would in L.A.," she said.
Frisco, a suburban boomtown that barely existed 30 years ago, has become a landing pad for transplants from around the country, drawn by relatively cheap housing and jobs in and around Dallas and Fort Worth.
White transplants make up a large share of new arrivals, but the Asian population has been growing even faster, making what might otherwise have been a predominantly white suburb much more diverse.
Julia Wada, a former Toyota executive who is Japanese American, moved with her family when the company relocated to the area. "I've been more connected with the Asian community here than I was in California," she said, in part because the community in the area was still growing and developing.
Indian restaurants and Asian shopping centers have sprung up everywhere. Many of the new houses are being designed to appeal to the growing South Asian population, with developers orienting them around the concept of Vastu Shastra, an ancient Indian design philosophy.
"They were not people who were Indian or familiar with the concept," said Sunitha Cheruvu, a native of India who moved to Frisco more than a decade ago. "But they learned from the influx of people."
Public schools have about 40 percent Asian students, up from 13 percent a decade ago.
The city now marks the Hindu festivals of Holi and Diwali, along with Lunar New Year, Christmas, Hanukkah and Ramadan, said the mayor, Jeff Cheney, a real estate developer and moderate Republican.
The politics of the city are decidedly mixed, including progressive Democrats and hard-line conservatives. Several Frisco residents were among those who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, but in recent school board elections, voters rejected candidates backed by a Christian conservative cellphone company, Patriot Mobile, that has been trying to shift the direction of the schools.
"There's an uneasy tension that exists, and you feel the tension -- it's under people's breath," said Shawn Amos, a writer and musician who is Black and moved to Frisco six years ago.
No doubt, some of the newcomers were drawn to Texas precisely because of its conservative politics. Allyson Menier, a court reporter, and her husband, a former Los Angeles police officer, moved in 2021 from California to escape what she said was an anti-police environment fostered by Democrats.
"The hostility is not here, like it was in California," she said. "We left everything and moved here with no friends, no family. And it was so worth it."
Odessa: Sparring Under a Mexican Flag
It was not just oil that made Odessa a familiar name to people outside Texas: It is also home of the high school football team immortalized in "Friday Night Lights."
But a new generation of Texans can be found on any given afternoon in a gym near downtown, shadow boxing under an oversized Mexican flag.
The rise of boxing, a popular sport in Mexico, is a sign of the changing city. Ariel Lares and Jonathan Armendariz, both 13, who were sparring one recent afternoon, said a lot of young people play football, but boxing brought them closer to their parents, who often watch Mexican bouts on television.
"We are all American," said Iram Sanchez, the owner of the gym, Gorilla Heavy Hitters. "The flag is a reminder of our culture."
As the number of Hispanic residents born in Texas outstrips the number of white people born in the state, there has been a notable change in the work force.
The Times identified more than 100 occupations with a significant shift away from Texas-born white workers and toward Hispanic employees, including office work, sales jobs and health care support.
Latino Texans are now a significant presence in a field that has, for generations, defined the Texas economy: energy extraction.
The oil-rich Permian Basin, where Odessa sits, has seen the biggest transformation. The Texas-born Hispanic population has doubled since 1990, while the Texas-born white population has declined by nearly a quarter.
A generation ago, about half of the state's oil field workers were born in Texas and white. Today, fewer than three out of 10 could be described that way.
The growing presence of Hispanic workers in the oil industry helps explain the Republican Party's continuing influence in places like Odessa, where voters elected Javier Joven, the city's first Hispanic mayor. The party, he said, "preached sweat equity. That spoke to me."
Mr. Matta, the City Council member, is also a conservative and said that the Democratic hope of riding a demographic wave to capture Texas has run up against economic realities. "Republicans favor more legislation that's favorable to drilling," he said. "You're not going to bite the hand that feeds you."
Yet it may be too early to draw conclusions.
Because the population of native-born Hispanics is so much younger than the white population, its impact on Texas politics is only just beginning. Each year, the electorate will grow more from Hispanic Texans reaching voting age than from white Texans reaching that milestone.
In the 2022 governor's race, Mr. Abbott handily defeated his Democratic opponent, Beto O'Rourke. But an analysis of election and census data shows that, in areas where the population of Texas-born Hispanics was higher, Mr. Abbott's vote share was lower. And those areas are rapidly taking over the state.
Houston: The New Atlanta?
In the 2010s, Texas became the state with the highest Black population growth. Most of that growth has occurred in major cities, particularly Fort Worth and Houston.
The city of Houston has long had thriving Black communities, but in recent years, the new arrivals have driven a kind of renaissance that is fueled, in large part, by who they are: middle-class Black people from other states with good jobs and business ideas.
"I thought maybe I would just stay for a year and then move back to the Washington, D.C., area," said Cherese Sullivan, a veterinarian who moved from Maryland in 2011. "But I found a lot of opportunities," she said. "I was able to get connected with a young Black professional scene."
She met another Black veterinarian and eventually they opened their own animal hospital on Almeda Road, a strip near downtown that has become a hub of Black-owned businesses: restaurants and bars, barbers and food trucks, a radio station and a medical clinic.
"That particular stretch of road is known as Houston's Black Wall Street," said Ms. Sullivan, who is raising twins with her husband in the city.
New arrivals have altered the makeup of neighborhoods. Ms. Walsh, who moved from New Orleans, found an apartment in the city's Galleria neighborhood. "I told myself, if things don't work out, I'm going to stay in Houston," she said.
Her initial restaurant position did not go as planned, but she got another job as a flight attendant. And she's picking up waitressing work on the side. "It was just a whole lot of opportunity," she said of the city. "There's something about Houston that they're about their business."
Census data shows a distinct pattern when it comes to Black migration into Texas. Among higher-income migrants, Texas, Georgia and Maryland are all destinations. But for more middle-income migrants, Texas stands above all others.
"It's just like Houston is being talked about in the same breath as Atlanta, or more," said KeAndré Jordan, who moved to the city for an oil industry job and now has his own marketing business.
Jeremy Craft was able to quit his job as a civil engineer and start a business collecting and sharing information about the city's Black-owned businesses for those interested in patronizing them.
Talking over a lunch of stuffed turkey legs at the Turkey Leg Hut, an Almeda Road staple, Mr. Craft said that within a few months of starting his business in 2019, he had collected about 300 listings. Now, he is up to 1,300.
"When you look at other cities, they're not as diverse as Houston," he said. "They don't have as many opportunities."

After U.A.W.'s Agreement, More Carmakers Raise Pay
South Korean automaker Hyundai has joined Honda and Toyota in raising factory wages after the United Auto Workers reached new contract deals with Detroit automakers.
Hyundai said Monday it will raise factory worker pay 25 percent by 2028, matching the general wage increase won by the U.A.W. Toyota raised factory pay 9 percent to 10 percent starting in January, while Honda said it will increase wages 11 percent during the same period.
Labor experts say the increases are at least in part aimed at thwarting U.A.W. President Shawn Fain's strategy of trying to organize U.S. auto plants run by foreign automakers and Tesla. Mr. Fain said terrified auto executives at nonunion plants are raising wages, and he called Toyota's pay increase the U.A.W. bump.
"U.A.W., that stands for 'You Are Welcome,"' he said.

Emirates Plans to Buy
$ 52 Billion of Boeing Jets
Long-haul carrier Emirates opened the Dubai Air Show on Monday with a $ 52 billion purchase of Boeing aircraft, showing how aviation has bounced back after the groundings of the coronavirus pandemic, even as Israel's war with Hamas clouds regional security.
Its low-cost sister airline, FlyDubai, followed up with an $ 11 billion order of 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, the first wide-body aircraft in its fleet. Together, the sales marked a significant win for Virginia-based Boeing on the first day of the air show, as airlines appear poised for even more billion-dollar deals this year.
Emirates C.E.O. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said the carrier would purchase 90 Boeing 777 aircraft, 55 of them 777-9 variants and 35 of them 777-8s.
Emirates will also add five 787 Dreamliners to its previous order of 30, Sheikh Saeed said.

Continental Plans to Cut Thousands of Workers
The German car parts manufacturer Continental said on Monday that it would cut thousands of jobs in its automotive division worldwide as part of a plan to save 400 million euros ( $ 428 million) a year from 2025.
The exact number of job cuts was not immediately clear, but it will amount to the "mid-four-digit range," the company said.
The news comes amid ongoing reports that Continental plans a restructuring and potential sell-offs, with its C.E.O., Nikolai Setzer, saying in September he was considering a change in ownership of the company's ContiTech division.
The works council of the automotive division urged the company in an internal statement seen by Reuters to rule out outright dismissals and use all possible measures to keep its work force on, from part-time retirement for older workers to retraining and reallocating staff.

ODESSA, Texas — Silhouetted against the predawn light of the West Texas sky, a group of oil field workers got ready for the tough job ahead on a September day — cleaning up a spill on a rig outside of Odessa — speaking a mix of English and Spanish.
All 80 employees of their company, Premier Energy Services, are Hispanic, reflecting a shift that has slowly transformed Texas’ oil-rich western expanse. Where a roughneck — the grease-stained symbol of Texas’ economic identity — was once typically a white man hoping to strike black gold, the average oil field worker is now a Hispanic man who was born in Texas.
“Growing up, my dad used to take me to work in the oil fields. It was a white man’s industry,” said a foreman, Alfredo Ramirez, 31, a third-generation Mexican American. “Today it is us Latinos.”
Mark Matta, a City Council member in Odessa, chuckled as he described a television series about a Texas oil rig in which most of the workers were white. “That show flipped our reality,” he said.
Understanding the reality of Texas matters. With a population of over 30 million, Texas is increasingly shaping the cultural and political direction of the country. Its economy is one of the largest in the world, growing faster than the nation’s as a whole.
The state has long been defined by demographic change, particularly its growing Hispanic population. But the nature of those changes, and how profound they have become, has often been misunderstood, even by those who follow the state closely.
The New York Times collected years of census data, analyzed migration patterns and traveled to communities across Texas to understand what is happening in the nation’s second-most populous state, a place that offers an important window into the future of both national politics and the attempts to deal with questions of identity and diversity.
What stood out was the degree to which Texas already has become a state of immigrants, a population that is now multigenerational.
The fastest growing demographic group is made up of the children of immigrants, predominantly Texas-born Hispanics. That means that white people, who had long been the state’s largest demographic group, are now outnumbered by those who are Hispanic, even among native-born Texans, a change first documented by the U.S. Census Bureau this year.
A visitor to the state 30 years ago would have encountered two born-and-bred white Texans for every Latino born on Texas soil. Today, those groups are of nearly equal size.
“Few in my family speak Spanish,” said Shawn Rodriquez, whose ancestors came from Mexico to Odessa, where he now owns an oil field services company. “Our ancestry is from right here in Texas.”
Texas has also been a magnet for people moving from other states, a fact celebrated by its Republican leaders, including Gov. Greg Abbott, who boast of luring businesses away from California and New York to their state’s lower taxes, cheaper housing and more conservative politics.
But because Texas is so populous, migration has less of an effect than it does on other fast-growing states, like Nevada and Arizona. And the composition of these domestic migrants is often misconstrued. While white professionals are indeed moving to Austin, the state is gaining two people of color for every white migrant.
Newcomers from other states are reshaping the suburbs in surprising ways. Take Frisco outside of Dallas. The city has seen an influx of white transplants to new developments on tracts of farmland. But a huge number of Asians have also moved in.
In 1990, when around 6,000 people lived in Frisco, the census listed just 29 Asian residents. Now, nearly a quarter of the city’s 220,000 residents are Asian.
Texas also leads the nation in the growth of its Black population, surpassing Georgia and Florida. And unlike Black transplants to other states, who are often either poor or rich, those coming to Texas are more likely to be middle class, census data shows. In Houston, Black-owned businesses have been thriving, with the city now rivaling Atlanta as a destination for Black families and young people.
“Everyone is coming to Houston,” said Victoria Walsh, 30, who moved from New Orleans for a restaurant job in 2018. “There’s a whole lot of jobs, a whole lot of new concepts, a new pop-up each week.”
The trends have already affected the state’s politics, and are likely to continue to do so. In Odessa, where the Latino share of the local population has nearly doubled to 56% since 1990, the mayor is still a conservative Republican, but for the first time, he is Hispanic.
Democrats have seen their margins of defeat shrink. This is happening not just in cities, where Democrats often now dominate, but also in various other areas with a large number of Texas-born Hispanics. Still, demographic changes alone will not guarantee victory for the party, as polls have found that a growing number of nonwhite voters may be up for grabs.
Republicans, recognizing the changes, have courted conservative Hispanics and have seen some recent electoral successes, particularly in the Rio Grande Valley.
For many Americans outside the state, Texas’ identity is quickly conjured: Cowboys and football. Guns and oil. Pickup trucks and Waylon Jennings.
In reality, it is a complex mixture: The Dallas suburbs recently hosted a professional cricket league, attracting thousands of screaming fans, and welcomed the return of a refurbished 1950s country music dance hall.
“The identity of being a Texan has changed completely,” said Ray Benson, a long-ago transplant from Pennsylvania whose western swing band, Asleep at the Wheel, played at the dance hall’s reopening. “I came to Texas to become a Texan. But now I think more people moving to Texas just bring whatever their culture was before.”
In reporting trips over miles and miles of Texas, to borrow a phrase from a classic song, the Times found a broad range of Texans, settling in a few representative places — a North Texas suburb, the roughneck hub of Odessa and the heart of Houston — to tell the story of a state in rapid transition.
Frisco: A Landing Pad for Transplants
Heather Eastburn and her husband were living in Los Angeles but after having children, they needed more space and decided to relocate to Frisco, Texas, near where her husband, a Republican wealth manager, was from.
Eastburn had doubts.
“People would tell me, ‘Oh, you’re going to have a good life there. It’s an easy life,’” she recalled. “And I was like, what does that mean?”
After the move, she discovered what they meant. The schools were good. Everything was new, down to the shopping carts at the grocery store. “It was like I was pushing a Cadillac around in the Kroger instead of fighting with something like you would in LA,” she said.
Frisco, a suburban boomtown that barely existed 30 years ago, has become a landing pad for transplants from around the country, drawn by relatively cheap housing and jobs in and around Dallas and Fort Worth.
White transplants make up a large share of new arrivals, but the Asian population has been growing even faster, making what might otherwise have been a predominantly white suburb much more diverse.
Julia Wada, a former Toyota executive who is Japanese American, moved with her family when the company relocated to the area. “I’ve been more connected with the Asian community here than I was in California,” she said, in part because the community in the area was still growing and developing.
Indian restaurants and Asian shopping centers have sprung up everywhere. Many of the new houses are being designed to appeal to the growing South Asian population, with developers orienting them around the concept of Vastu Shastra, an ancient Indian design philosophy.
“They were not people who were Indian or familiar with the concept,” said Sunitha Cheruvu, a native of India who moved to Frisco more than a decade ago. “But they learned from the influx of people.”
Public schools have about 40% Asian students, up from 13% a decade ago.
The city now marks the Hindu festivals of Holi and Diwali, along with Lunar New Year, Christmas, Hanukkah and Ramadan, said the mayor, Jeff Cheney, a real estate developer and moderate Republican.
The politics of the city are decidedly mixed, including progressive Democrats and hard-line conservatives. Several Frisco residents were among those who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, but in recent school board elections, voters rejected candidates backed by a Christian conservative cellphone company, Patriot Mobile, that has been trying to shift the direction of the schools.
“There’s an uneasy tension that exists, and you feel the tension — it’s under people’s breath,” said Shawn Amos, a writer and musician who is Black and moved to Frisco six years ago.
No doubt, some of the newcomers were drawn to Texas precisely because of its conservative politics. Allyson Menier, a court reporter, and her husband, a former Los Angeles police officer, moved in 2021 from California to escape what she said was an anti-police environment fostered by Democrats.
“The hostility is not here, like it was in California,” she said. “We left everything and moved here with no friends, no family. And it was so worth it.”
Odessa: Sparring Under a Mexican Flag
It was not just oil that made Odessa a familiar name to people outside Texas: It is also home of the high school football team immortalized in “Friday Night Lights.”
But a new generation of Texans can be found on any given afternoon in a gym near downtown, shadow boxing under an oversized Mexican flag.
The rise of boxing, a popular sport in Mexico, is a sign of the changing city. Ariel Lares and Jonathan Armendariz, both 13, who were sparring one recent afternoon, said a lot of young people play football, but boxing brought them closer to their parents, who often watch Mexican bouts on television.
“We are all American,” said Iram Sanchez, the owner of the gym, Gorilla Heavy Hitters. “The flag is a reminder of our culture.”
As the number of Hispanic residents born in Texas outstrips the number of white people born in the state, there has been a notable change in the workforce.
The Times identified more than 100 occupations with a significant shift away from Texas-born white workers and toward Hispanic employees, including office work, sales jobs and health care support.
Latino Texans are now a significant presence in a field that has, for generations, defined the Texas economy: energy extraction.
The oil-rich Permian Basin, where Odessa sits, has seen the biggest transformation. The Texas-born Hispanic population has doubled since 1990, while the Texas-born white population has declined by nearly a quarter.
A generation ago, about half of the state’s oil field workers were born in Texas and white. Today, fewer than 3 out of 10 could be described that way.
The growing presence of Hispanic workers in the oil industry helps explain the Republican Party’s continuing influence in places like Odessa, where voters elected Javier Joven, the city’s first Hispanic mayor. The party, he said, “preached sweat equity. That spoke to me.”
Matta, the City Council member, is also a conservative and said that the Democratic hope of riding a demographic wave to capture Texas has run up against economic realities. “Republicans favor more legislation that’s favorable to drilling,” he said. “You’re not going to bite the hand that feeds you.”
Yet it may be too early to draw conclusions.
Because the population of native-born Hispanics is so much younger than the white population, its impact on Texas politics is only just beginning. Each year, the electorate will grow more from Hispanic Texans reaching voting age than from white Texans reaching that milestone.
In the 2022 governor’s race, Abbott handily defeated his Democratic opponent, Beto O’Rourke. But an analysis of election and census data shows that, in areas where the population of Texas-born Hispanics was higher, Abbott’s vote share was lower. And those areas are rapidly taking over the state.
Houston: The New Atlanta?
In the 2010s, Texas became the state with the highest Black population growth. Most of that growth has occurred in major cities, particularly Fort Worth and Houston.
The city of Houston has long had thriving Black communities, but in recent years, the new arrivals have driven a kind of renaissance that is fueled, in large part, by who they are: middle-class Black people from other states with good jobs and business ideas.
“I thought maybe I would just stay for a year and then move back to the Washington, D.C., area,” said Cherese Sullivan, a veterinarian who moved from Maryland in 2011. “But I found a lot of opportunities,” she said. “I was able to get connected with a young Black professional scene.”
She met another Black veterinarian and eventually they opened their own animal hospital on Almeda Road, a strip near downtown that has become a hub of Black-owned businesses: restaurants and bars, barbers and food trucks, a radio station and a medical clinic.
“That particular stretch of road is known as Houston’s Black Wall Street,” said Sullivan, who is raising twins with her husband in the city.
New arrivals have altered the makeup of neighborhoods. Walsh, who moved from New Orleans, found an apartment in the city’s Galleria neighborhood. “I told myself, if things don’t work out, I’m going to stay in Houston,” she said.
Her initial restaurant position did not go as planned, but she got another job as a flight attendant. And she’s picking up waitressing work on the side. “It was just a whole lot of opportunity,” she said of the city. “There’s something about Houston that they’re about their business.”
Census data shows a distinct pattern when it comes to Black migration into Texas. Among higher-income migrants, Texas, Georgia and Maryland are all destinations. But for more middle-income migrants, Texas stands above all others.
“It’s just like Houston is being talked about in the same breath as Atlanta, or more,” said KeAndré Jordan, who moved to the city for an oil industry job and now has his own marketing business.
Jeremy Craft was able to quit his job as a civil engineer and start a business collecting and sharing information about the city’s Black-owned businesses for those interested in patronizing them.
Talking over a lunch of stuffed turkey legs at the Turkey Leg Hut, an Almeda Road staple, Craft said that within a few months of starting his business in 2019, he had collected about 300 listings. Now, he is up to 1,300.
“When you look at other cities, they’re not as diverse as Houston,” he said. “They don’t have as many opportunities.”

Full text: Chris Caputo stood on the tarmac at Burlington International Airport in Vermont in early October and looked to the clouds in the distance. He had piloted military and commercial aircraft over a long career, racking up thousands of flight hours, but the trip he was about to take would be very different.
That's because the airplane Mr. Caputo would fly runs on batteries. Over the next 16 days, he and his colleagues flew the plane, a CX300 built by their employer, Beta Technologies, down the East Coast. They would make nearly two dozen stops to rest and recharge, flying through congested airspace over Boston, New York, Washington and other cities.
When the journey came to an end in Florida, Beta handed the plane over to the Air Force, which will experiment with it over the next few months. The trip offered a vision of what aviation could look like years from now -- one in which the skies are filled with aircraft that do not emit the greenhouse gases that are dangerously warming up the Earth.
"We're doing some really meaningful work for our state, our country and the planet," Mr. Caputo said. "It's hard not to want to be a part of it."
A Flurry of Activity
For most of aviation history, electric aircraft have been little more than a fantasy. But technological advancements, particularly in batteries, and billions of dollars of investment have helped make short-distance electric air travel feasible -- and, its backers hope, commercially viable.
Beta, which is privately held, has raised more than $ 800 million from investors like Fidelity, Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund and the private equity firm TPG Capital. The company employs about 600 people, mostly in Vermont, and recently finished building a factory in Burlington where it plans to mass produce its aircraft, which have yet to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration.
The first will be the CX300, a sleek, futuristic plane with a 50-foot wingspan, large curved windows and a rear propeller. That plane is designed to carry about 1,250 pounds of cargo and will be followed soon after by the A250, which shares about 80 percent of the CX300's design and is outfitted with lift rotors to take off and land like a helicopter. Both aircraft, which Beta markets as the Alia, will eventually carry passengers, the company says.
Beta is one of many companies working on electric aviation. In California, Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation are developing battery-powered aircraft capable of vertical flight that, they say, will ferry a handful of passengers short distances. Those companies have backers like Toyota, Stellantis, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and large investment firms. Established manufacturers like Airbus, Boeing and Embraer are also working on electric aircraft.
The U.S. government has mobilized behind the industry, too. The F.A.A. aims to support operations of aircraft that use new means of propulsion at scale in one or more places by 2028. And the Air Force is awarding contracts and testing vehicles, including Beta's CX300 and an aircraft that Joby delivered to Edwards Air Force Base in California in September.
'Almost One With the Plane'
Beta's plane is not as large and powerful as the jets that Mr. Caputo flew for the Air Force, Air National Guard or Delta. But what it lacks in heft, it makes up for in charm, he said, noting that the airplane is incredibly quiet and responsive, making it a pleasure to fly.
"You're almost one with the plane," Mr. Caputo said, adding later: "You can kind of hear and feel the air going across the flight control surfaces. We wear helmets right now because it's experimental and safety is paramount, but we can literally take the helmets off in the aircraft and just talk to one another."
Mr. Caputo said the CX300 and other electric aircraft could open up new opportunities, like better connecting rural areas that have little or no direct air service.
Beta's airplane has flown as far as 386 miles on a single charge, but the company said it expected its customers to generally use it to carry out trips of 100 to 150 miles. The plane's journey to Florida was allowed under limited authority granted by the F.A.A.
In addition to producing no emissions, electric aircraft are designed to be simpler to operate and maintain than conventional helicopters and planes. But they are not expected to take to the skies in large numbers for years. Initially, their trips are likely to be short -- from Manhattan to Kennedy International Airport, for example, or Burlington to Syracuse, N.Y.
Modern batteries can support limited range and weight. As a result, the aircraft that they power can generally carry only a handful of passengers, or the equivalent load in cargo.
Early on, electric aircraft are expected to compete mainly with helicopters and cars and trucks. In cities, widespread flights won't be possible without expanded infrastructure like vertical landing and takeoff sites and public support. The cost of producing such aircraft will also be high to start, limiting their use to the well-heeled and to critical services like medical evacuations, experts said.
In some ways, the challenge and the promise of electric aviation today are like those of the automobile at the turn of the 20th century, said Kevin Michaels, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, an aviation consulting firm.
"You had several hundred manufacturers around the world, all with their own unique approaches to making these machines, but you didn't have the roads, you didn't have traffic lights, you didn't have insurance," he said. But, he added, the industry eventually found its way. "Things settled down 20 years later, and eventually costs fell, and winners emerged. And it changed the way things were done, the way people lived."
Aiming to Earn Trust
Kyle Clark, Beta's founder, is attuned to those concerns, which is why, he said, Beta has taken a more methodical approach.
"I get it, the industry has a trust issue," he said. "It's too much change, too quick, in an industry that has an exceptionally high standard of safety."
The company plans first to win F.A.A. certification next year for a motor it has developed, followed by approvals of its first and second aircraft in subsequent years. The CX300 will use runways to move cargo, avoiding the need for new infrastructure, Mr. Clark said.
That approach has been endorsed by several customers, according to Beta, including the shipping giant UPS and United Therapeutics, which plans to use the vehicles to transport organs for transplant. Bristow Group, another customer, plans to use the aircraft the way it uses helicopters today, to transport goods and people to offshore energy installations, run search and rescue missions for governments, and for other purposes.
Bristow, which is working with eight companies developing next-generation aircraft, expects the vehicles to create new opportunities because they are quieter than helicopters and are expected to be 60 to 70 percent cheaper to operate, according to David Stepanek, an executive vice president at Bristow.
In addition to building aircraft, Beta is establishing a network of chargers that can power its aircraft as well as cars, trucks and other vehicles. More than a dozen have been set up, including one at the Air Force site in Florida, making it the military's first electric aircraft charging station.
The company also built a prototype landing site for aircraft capable of vertical flight, which sits atop repurposed shipping containers, which house energy storage and a small living space for pilots to rest between trips.
The day that Beta's aircraft left Burlington in October, Mr. Caputo flew it on two legs, arriving at sunset at Griffiss International Airport in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains, near where he grew up. He ordered Italian food for the Beta team from a restaurant he used to frequent with his family, and his mother drove out to see the aircraft in person for the first time. The next morning, he flew the plane to Syracuse, N.Y., and handed it over to colleagues who would fly it the rest of the way.
Much of the popular discussion about electric aircraft revolves around the idea that they will effectively be used as flying cars to whiz people around big cities. In the near future, though, they may just as likely be used to ferry goods and passengers outside dense urban areas, in places like upstate New York and Vermont.
"To me, it's going to have a really meaningful impact on how we move organs and goods and services," he said, "and reconnect the rural parts of America that I think get often forgotten."

BURLINGTON, Vt. — Chris Caputo stood on the tarmac at Burlington International Airport in Vermont in early October and looked to the clouds in the distance. He had piloted military and commercial aircraft over a long career, racking up thousands of flight hours, but the trip he was about to take would be very different.
That’s because the airplane Caputo would fly runs on batteries. Over the next 16 days, he and his colleagues flew the plane, a CX300 built by their employer, Beta Technologies, down the East Coast. They would make nearly two dozen stops to rest and recharge, flying through congested airspace over Boston, New York, Washington and other cities.
When the journey came to an end in Florida, Beta handed the plane over to the Air Force, which will experiment with it over the next few months. The trip offered a vision of what aviation could look like years from now — one in which the skies are filled with aircraft that do not emit the greenhouse gases that are dangerously warming up the Earth.
“We’re doing some really meaningful work for our state, our country and the planet,” Caputo said. “It’s hard not to want to be a part of it.”
A Flurry of Activity
For most of aviation history, electric aircraft have been little more than a fantasy. But technological advancements, particularly in batteries, and billions of dollars of investment have helped make short-distance electric air travel feasible — and, its backers hope, commercially viable.
Beta, which is privately held, has raised more than $800 million from investors such as Fidelity, Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund and private equity firm TPG Capital. The company employs about 600 people, mostly in Vermont, and recently finished building a factory in Burlington where it plans to mass produce its aircraft, which have yet to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration.
The first will be the CX300, a sleek, futuristic plane with a 50-foot wingspan, large curved windows and a rear propeller. That plane is designed to carry about 1,250 pounds of cargo and will be followed soon after by the A250, which shares about 80% of the CX300’s design and is outfitted with lift rotors to take off and land like a helicopter. Both aircraft, which Beta markets as the Alia, will eventually carry passengers, the company says.
Beta is one of many companies working on electric aviation. In California, Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation are developing battery-powered aircraft capable of vertical flight that, they say, will ferry a handful of passengers short distances. Those companies have backers such as Toyota, Stellantis, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and large investment firms. Established manufacturers like Airbus, Boeing and Embraer are also working on electric aircraft.
The U.S. government has mobilized behind the industry, too. The FAA aims to support operations of aircraft that use new means of propulsion at scale in one or more places by 2028. And the Air Force is awarding contracts and testing vehicles, including Beta’s CX300 and an aircraft that Joby delivered to Edwards Air Force Base in California in September.
‘Almost One With the Plane’
Beta’s plane is not as large and powerful as the jets Caputo flew for the Air Force, Air National Guard or Delta. But what it lacks in heft, it makes up for in charm, he said, noting that the airplane is incredibly quiet and responsive, making it a pleasure to fly.
“You’re almost one with the plane,” Caputo said, adding later: “You can kind of hear and feel the air going across the flight control surfaces. We wear helmets right now because it’s experimental and safety is paramount, but we can literally take the helmets off in the aircraft and just talk to one another.”
Caputo said the CX300 and other electric aircraft could open up new opportunities, like better connecting rural areas that have little or no direct air service.
Beta’s airplane has flown as far as 386 miles on a single charge, but the company said it expects its customers to generally use it to carry out trips of 100 to 150 miles. The plane’s journey to Florida was allowed under limited authority granted by the FAA.
In addition to producing no emissions, electric aircraft are designed to be simpler to operate and maintain than conventional helicopters and planes. But they are not expected to take to the skies in large numbers for years. Initially, their trips are likely to be short — from Manhattan to Kennedy International Airport in New York, for example, or Burlington to Syracuse, New York.
Modern batteries can support limited range and weight. As a result, the aircraft that they power can generally carry only a handful of passengers, or the equivalent load in cargo.
Early on, electric aircraft are expected to compete mainly with helicopters and cars and trucks. In cities, widespread flights won’t be possible without expanded infrastructure like vertical landing and takeoff sites and public support. The cost of producing such aircraft will also be high to start, limiting their use to the well-heeled and to critical services such as medical evacuations, experts said.
In some ways, the challenge and the promise of electric aviation today are like those of the automobile at the turn of the 20th century, said Kevin Michaels, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, an aviation consulting firm.
“You had several hundred manufacturers around the world, all with their own unique approaches to making these machines, but you didn’t have the roads, you didn’t have traffic lights, you didn’t have insurance,” he said. But, he added, the industry eventually found its way. “Things settled down 20 years later, and eventually costs fell, and winners emerged. And it changed the way things were done, the way people lived.”
Aiming to Earn Trust
Kyle Clark, Beta’s founder, is attuned to those concerns, which is why he says that Beta has taken a more methodical approach.
“I get it, the industry has a trust issue,” he said. “It’s too much change, too quick, in an industry that has an exceptionally high standard of safety.”
The company plans first to win FAA certification next year for a motor it has developed, followed by approvals of its first and second aircraft in subsequent years. The CX300 will use runways to move cargo, avoiding the need for new infrastructure, Clark said.
That approach has been endorsed by several customers, according to Beta, including the shipping giant UPS and United Therapeutics, which plans to use the vehicles to transport organs for transplant. Bristow Group, another customer, plans to use the aircraft the way it uses helicopters, to transport goods and people to offshore energy installations, run search and rescue missions for governments, and for other purposes.
Bristow, which is working with eight companies developing next-generation aircraft, expects the vehicles to create new opportunities because they are quieter than helicopters and are expected to be 60% to 70% cheaper to operate, according to David Stepanek, an executive vice president at Bristow.
In addition to building aircraft, Beta is establishing a network of chargers that can power its aircraft as well as cars, trucks and other vehicles. More than a dozen have been set up, including one at the Air Force site in Florida, making it the military’s first electric aircraft charging station.
The company also built a prototype landing site for aircraft capable of vertical flight, which sits atop repurposed shipping containers, which house energy storage and a small living space for pilots to rest between trips.
The day Beta’s aircraft left Burlington in October, Caputo flew it on two legs, arriving at sunset at Griffiss International Airport in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains, near where he grew up. He ordered Italian food for the Beta team from a restaurant he used to frequent with his family, and his mother drove out to see the aircraft in person for the first time. The next morning, he flew the plane to Syracuse, New York, and handed it over to colleagues who would fly it the rest of the way.
Much of the popular discussion about electric aircraft revolves around the idea that they will effectively be used as flying cars to whiz people around big cities. In the near future, though, they may just as likely be used to ferry goods and passengers outside dense urban areas, in places like upstate New York and Vermont.
“To me, it’s going to have a really meaningful impact on how we move organs and goods and services,” he said, “and reconnect the rural parts of America that I think get often forgotten.”

In Crypto Case, Using an Image as a Shield: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Investors bought into the perception of the FTX founder as an unkempt boy genius. The jury didn't buy it.
Sam Bankman-Fried, crypto's Icarus, was convicted of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy on Thursday night after a trial that generated 10 million pages of documents and only a few hours of jury deliberation. As ever, it is perhaps best to start from the very beginning.
As a boy coming of age in the most rarefied quarters of the achievement class, he grew up in a family that viewed the celebration of birthdays and holidays as an inefficiency easily forgone. From such a childhood emerged an adult who worked 22 hours a day and submitted the prospect of any interaction with another person to a cost-benefit calculation that frequently left him canceling meetings and other obligations at the last minute, because, as Michael Lewis writes in "Going Infinite," his book about Mr. Bankman-Fried's rise and fall, "he had done some math in his head that proved that you weren't worth the time."
From the outset, the decision to have Mr. Bankman-Fried testify in the federal trial that charged him with some of the most grievous acts of financial fraud in the country's history seemed like a self-defeating proposition. Ostentatiously unfazed by physical beauty, art, novels, fashion, religion and heated food, he was also an avowed hater of Shakespeare ("one-dimensional" characters, "illogical plots," "obvious endings") who was mystified by emotionally driven decisions, challenging any effort to place him somewhere on a continuum of human relatability.
What would a jury of his peers possibly look like? Or, in the specific absence of that, what would 12 ordinary people see when they were seated on the other side of the witness stand from him? The prosecution hoped that they would observe a grown man, steeped in self-contradiction and capable of criminality, rather than the 31-year-old boy Mr. Bankman-Fried appeared to be, someone whose adolescent enthusiasms and distractibility caused him to make billions of dollars worth of hapless, innocent errors. In the end, the jury saw only the duplicitous adult.
Among the many paradoxes surrounding the case was the idea that someone so antagonistic to the perceived value of image and story would have paid such careful and perversely winning attention to his own.
FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that for a short time made Mr. Bankman-Fried the richest person in the world under 30 before it completely collapsed, had no chief financial officer, no human resources or compliance departments, no board of directors. But it employed a public-relations manager who spent her time arranging the interviews that Mr. Bankman-Fried gave so freely. In these conversations, he forged the public's perception of him as an ungroomed radical utilitarian, a Corolla-driving savant who cared about money only to the extent that he wanted to give it all away.
Implicit in the government's case was the insincerity of that conceit and the foundation it laid for the practice of other, more meaningful forms of deception. "You didn't cut your hair because you were busy and lazy?" the prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon, asked the defendant in her cross-examination. Her question was rhetorical.
She would deploy this tactic repeatedly -- asking Mr. Bankman-Fried if he said x or y, encountering a vague response and then proving that he had said whatever he claimed he could not really remember. During this particular sequence, she introduced a statement he had made revealing that it was "important" for the business for people "to think I look crazy." She further informed the courtroom that when Anthony Scaramucci, one of Mr. Bankman-Fried's investors, told him to put on a suit, Mr. Bankman-Fried responded that T-shirts were crucial to his "brand."
Held up against other notorious investors whose fate landed them in Lower Manhattan federal court, Mr. Bankman-Fried stands out particularly for these commitments to self-promotion. Michael Milken, known for his role in creating junk bonds in the 1980s and for the prison sentence on fraud and racketeering charges that followed, was an extremely private person who avoided publicity, as one is probably well-advised to do when taking up tax evasion.
Later, Bernie Madoff, who owned at least two wedding rings and paired them to whichever vintage watch he wore from his collection, dressed to fade into the landscape of the Wall Street establishment. He avoided the social scenes of the Upper East Side and Palm Beach as persistently as Mr. Bankman-Fried went after the company of Tom Brady and Katy Perry.
For those without expertise in Wall Street jargon -- backstop liquidity provider, clawback prevention -- the case against Mr. Bankman-Fried could seem incredibly complicated. At one point, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan interrupted a discussion of a risk engine that a few years earlier had misfired to troubling results, to clarify that the "risk engine" was not, in fact, a person.
In reality, the fraud that Mr. Bankman-Fried orchestrated was simple and all too similar to what Bernie Madoff had been doing all along: shifting around and repurposing other people's assets for his own use.
The significant difference pertains to credentials and pedigree and how they were set in motion. Mr. Madoff, a law-school dropout from Queens who got his start trading penny stocks -- much like Jordan Belfort, the self-described "Wolf of Wall Street" -- might have identified no other path to getting rich beyond the hustle. But Mr. Bankman-Fried, a graduate of M.I.T., a gifted student of math and physics who grew up in the heart of the technocracy, the son of Stanford law school professors, nevertheless defaulted to the same shell game even when there were so many other roads available to him.
His defense essentially boiled down to the notion that mistakes were made, chief among them that he managed risk poorly but never intended to do anything wrong. However much Mr. Bankman-Fried might have paid attention to his narrative, he brought less attention to his actual product.
As it is in many high-profile criminal cases, the actions and motives of the accused may never be fully understood. But it is also true that these cases often reveal broader cultural truths. Mr. Bankman-Fried spoke on the stand, as he does in life, in a voice that was high, thin and childlike.
His delivery drew easy comparisons to its theatrical opposite, the deep, masculine voice Elizabeth Holmes felt she needed to affect to be taken seriously as a young ambitious woman in Silicon Valley. Ms. Holmes filled her board of directors with prominent old men. For Mr. Bankman-Fried, it was apparently fine to designate all people over 45 as "useless" and to look and sound like a 13-year-old boy even as he got to speak alongside Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.
Like child performers pushed toward maturity at a young age who often endure the consequences years later, Mr. Bankman-Fried was brought up as an intellectual equal of his parents and their circle. Once, when he was young and a friend of the family explained that something was too complicated for him and his brother to understand, Mr. Bankman-Fried's father took the friend aside and told him that he and his wife did not speak to their children that way. While a typical adolescence is likely to expose you to a fair amount of risk, Mr. Bankman-Fried did not have a typical adolescence.
What emerged later in his professional life, as the endless coverage of him made clear, what perhaps had been sublimated all along was an insatiable appetite for risk. Almost no financial bet could seem too dangerous. From a distance it could look like an addiction. Now, he may have finally been forced to give it up.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Cruise has hired a law firm to investigate how it responded to regulators, as its cars sit idle and questions grow about its C.E.O.'s expansion plans.
Two months ago, Kyle Vogt, the chief executive of Cruise, choked up as he recounted how a driver had killed a 4-year-old girl in a stroller at a San Francisco intersection. "It barely made the news," he said, pausing to collect himself. "Sorry. I get emotional."
To make streets safer, he said in an interview, cities should embrace self-driving cars like those designed by Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors. They do not get distracted, drowsy or drunk, he said, and being programmed to put safety first meant they could substantially reduce car-related fatalities.
Now Mr. Vogt's driverless car company faces its own safety concerns as he contends with angry regulators, anxious employees, and skepticism about his management and the viability of a business that he has often said will save lives while generating billions of dollars.
On Oct. 2, a car hit a woman in a San Francisco intersection and flung her into the path of one of Cruise's driverless taxis. The Cruise car ran over her, briefly stopped and then dragged her some 20 feet before pulling to the curb, causing severe injuries.
California's Department of Motor Vehicles last week accused Cruise of omitting the dragging of the woman from a video of the incident it initially provided to the agency. The D.M.V. said the company had "misrepresented" its technology and told Cruise to shut down its driverless car operations in the state.
Two days later, Cruise went further and voluntarily suspended all of its driverless operations around the country, taking 400 or so driverless cars off the road. Since then, Cruise's board has hired the law firm Quinn Emanuel to investigate the company's response to the incident, including its interactions with regulators, law enforcement and the media.
The board plans to evaluate the findings and any recommended changes. Exponent, a consulting firm that evaluates complex software systems, is conducting a separate review of the crash, said two people who attended a companywide meeting at Cruise on Monday.
Cruise employees worry that there is no easy way to fix the company's problems, said five former and current employees and business partners, while its rivals fear Cruise's issues could lead to tougher driverless car rules for all of them.
Company insiders are putting the blame for what went wrong on a tech industry culture -- led by the 38-year-old Mr. Vogt -- that put a priority on the speed of the program over safety. In the competition between Cruise and its top driverless car rival, Waymo, Mr. Vogt wanted to dominate in the same way Uber dominated its smaller ride-hailing competitor, Lyft.
"Kyle is a guy who is willing to take risks, and he is willing to move quickly. He is very Silicon Valley," said Matthew Wansley, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law in New York who specializes in emerging automotive technologies. "That both explains the success of Cruise and its mistakes."
When Mr. Vogt spoke to the company about its suspended operations on Monday, he said that he did not know when they could start again and that layoffs could be coming, according to two employees who attended the companywide meeting.
He acknowledged that Cruise had lost the public's trust, the employees said, and outlined a plan to win it back by being more transparent and putting more emphasis on safety. He named Louise Zhang, vice president of safety, as the company's interim chief safety officer and said she would report directly to him.
"Trust is one of those things that takes a long time to build and just seconds to lose," Mr. Vogt said, according to attendees. "We need to get to the bottom of this and start rebuilding that trust."
Cruise declined to make Mr. Vogt available for an interview. G.M. said in a statement that its "commitment to Cruise with the goal of commercialization remains steadfast." It said it believed in the company's mission and technology and supported its steps to put safety first.
Mr. Vogt began working on self-driving cars as a teenager. When he was 13, he programmed a Power Wheels ride-on toy car to follow the yellow line in a parking lot. He later participated in a government-sponsored self-driving car competition while studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In 2013, he started Cruise Automation. The company retrofitted conventional cars with sensors and computers to operate autonomously on highways. He sold the business three years later to G.M. for $ 1 billion.
After the deal closed, Dan Ammann, G.M.'s president, took over as Cruise's chief executive, and Mr. Vogt became its president and chief technology officer.
As president, Mr. Vogt built out Cruise's engineering team while the company expanded to about 2,000 employees from 40, former employees said. He championed bringing cars to as many markets as fast as possible, believing that the speedier the company moved, the more lives it would save, former employees said.
In 2021, Mr. Vogt took over as chief executive. Mary T. Barra, G.M.'s chief executive, began including Mr. Vogt on earnings calls and presentations, where he hyped the self-driving market and predicted that Cruise would have one million cars by 2030.
Mr. Vogt pressed his company to continue its aggressive expansion, learning from problems its cars ran into while driving in San Francisco. The company charged an average of $ 10.50 per ride in the city.
After a Cruise vehicle collided with a Toyota Prius driving in a bus lane last summer, some people at the company proposed having its vehicles temporarily avoid streets with bus lanes, former employees said. But Mr. Vogt vetoed that idea, saying Cruise's vehicles needed to continue to drive those streets to master their complexity. The company later changed its software to reduce the risk of similar accidents.
In August, a Cruise driverless car collided with a San Francisco fire truck that was responding to an emergency. The company later changed the way its cars detect sirens.
But after the crash, city officials and activists pressured the state to slow Cruise's expansion. They also called on Cruise to provide more data about collisions, including documentation of unplanned stops, traffic violations and vehicle performance, said Aaron Peskin, president of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors.
"Cruise's corporate behavior over time has increasingly led to a lack of trust," Mr. Peskin said.
With its business frozen, there are concerns that Cruise is becoming too much of a financial burden on G.M. and is hurting the auto giant's reputation. Ms. Barra told investors that Cruise had "tremendous opportunity to grow" just hours before California's D.MV. told Cruise to shut down its driverless operations.
Cruise has not collected fares or ferried riders in more than a week. In San Francisco, Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, Miami, and Austin, Texas, hundreds of Cruise's white and orange Chevrolet Bolts sit stagnant. The shutdown complicates Cruise's ambition of hitting its goal of $ 1 billion of revenue in 2025.
G.M. has spent an average of $ 588 million a quarter on Cruise over the past year, a 42 percent increase from a year ago. Each Chevrolet Bolt that Cruise operates costs $ 150,000 to $ 200,000, according to a person familiar with its operations.
Half of Cruise's 400 cars were in San Francisco when the driverless operations were stopped. Those vehicles were supported by a vast operations staff, with 1.5 workers per vehicle. The workers intervened to assist the company's vehicles every 2.5 to five miles, according to two people familiar with is operations. In other words, they frequently had to do something to remotely control a car after receiving a cellular signal that it was having problems.
To cover its spiraling costs, G.M. will need to inject or raise more funds for the business, said Chris McNally, a financial analyst at Evercore ISI. During a call with analysts in late October, Ms. Barra said G.M. would share its funding plans before the end of the year.

Full text: Tentative accords at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis are the most generous in decades, raising costs as the industry shifts to electric vehicles.
A six-week wave of strikes that hobbled the three largest U.S. automakers has resulted in tentative contract agreements that would give workers their biggest pay raises in decades while avoiding a protracted work stoppage that could have damaged the economy.
On Monday, General Motors and the United Automobile Workers reached a deal that mirrored agreements the union had reached in recent days with Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler. The terms will be costly for the automakers as they undertake a switch to electric vehicles, while setting the stage for labor strife and demands for higher pay at nonunion automakers like Tesla and Toyota.
The tentative agreements, which still require ratification by union members, also appeared to be a win for President Biden, who had risked political capital by picketing with striking workers at a G.M. facility in Michigan last month.
"They have reached a historic agreement," Mr. Biden said Monday after speaking with Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president. The deals, the president said, "reward autoworkers who gave up much to keep the industry working and going during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago."
The strike stretched longer than White House officials would have liked, but was resolved before causing significant shortages of new cars and trucks that might have frustrated voters already angry about inflation.
"The near-term impact of this strike will be relatively minor," said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, an online auto sales site.
But Mr. Brauer warned that, in the long term, Ford, G.M. and Stellantis would have to raise car prices to maintain their profits. Their competitors will follow suit to take advantage of the opportunity to earn more money, he said. "This is going to make cars more expensive," Mr. Brauer added.
G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in a statement on Monday that the tentative agreement "reflects the contributions of the team while enabling us to continue to invest in our future and provide good jobs in the U.S."
Potentially the most far-reaching effect of the strike could be on manufacturing workers not represented by the U.A.W. The contracts the union negotiated are the latest in a series of prominent victories for organized labor, including Hollywood writers, UPS workers and even some university employees.
Mr. Fain has portrayed the tentative agreements as a signal for the union to begin organizing drives at Tesla, which dominates the fast-growing electric car business, and foreign-owned companies like Toyota, Honda and BMW that have large nonunion operations in the United States. The union will "organize like we've never organized before," Mr. Fain said Sunday.
Companies without unions can expect the U.A.W. to deploy the same hardball tactics that Mr. Fain used against Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, including rhetorical attacks on multimillion-dollar executive pay and hourly wages that have failed to keep pace with high inflation.
Even if those union campaigns fail, as they often have in the past, they may prompt some employers to pre-emptively give workers raises.
"This agreement is going to have a trickle-down effect," said Helen Rella, who specializes in employment litigation at Wilk Auslander, a New York law firm.
Ford agreed on a tentative pact on Wednesday. Stellantis followed on Saturday. Details of all the agreements had not yet been published, but they include a 25 percent pay increase over the next four and a half years and provisions to make sure the raises are not eaten up by inflation.
The top U.A.W. wage would rise to more than $ 40 over the life of the new contracts, from $ 32 an hour. That would allow employees working 40 hours a week to earn about $ 84,000 a year.
The agreements provide at least some protections to workers as electric vehicles replace gasoline models, and jobs at battery factories supplant jobs making components for combustion engine vehicles.
In Ford's case, workers at battery factories that the company plans to build in Tennessee and Michigan would be covered by the terms of the union contract. (Ford suspended work at the Michigan plant in September, saying it was not sure it could manufacture batteries there at a competitive price.)
The U.A.W. said its new contract with G.M. would cover workers at Ultium Cells, a battery-making joint venture with LG Energy Solution. One Ultium factory, in Ohio, is up and running, and two others are under construction in Tennessee and Michigan.
The increases in hourly wages would add to the automakers' costs when they already pay their workers more than Tesla and most foreign automakers. But the burden would be manageable, analysts said.
"Everybody had their pencils out, and I'm quite certain the deal wouldn't have been signed if they weren't confident they could remain competitive," said Steve Patton, mobility sector leader for consulting firm EY.
The agreements appear to be victories on multiple fronts for Mr. Biden, who has yoked his economic message to his success at delivering for union workers.
Mr. Biden's brief stint on a U.A.W. picket line last month was a first for a sitting president. He has promised that union workers would benefit from tax credits and other incentives to encourage people to buy electric vehicles. The incentives are available only for cars made in the United States, Canada or Mexico.
The biggest risk to Mr. Biden -- that the contract hinders automakers' competitiveness -- is unlikely to become manifest before next year's election.
The union's contracts with the three automakers, covering nearly 150,000 workers, expired on Sept. 15. Since then, the union has called on more than 45,000 workers to walk off the job at factories and spare-parts warehouses across the country. In the most recent escalation on Saturday, shortly after the union reached a deal with Stellantis, the U.A.W. told workers to go on strike at G.M.'s plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., which makes several sport utility vehicle models.
The strike has halted the production of some of the companies' most profitable vehicles, including the Cadillac Escalade S.U.V., the Ram 1500 pickup truck and the Ford Bronco S.U.V.
G.M. said last week that the strike had lowered its earnings by about $ 800 million, before interest and taxes, with part of the impact coming in the third quarter and most in the fourth quarter.
Ford's deal with the U.A.W. would shave about one percentage point off the company's profit margin, said Tom Narayan, global autos analyst at RBC Capital Markets. But he said the carmakers faced bigger challenges, like a decline in consumer's ability to buy new vehicles and a slowdown in the growth of electric vehicle sales.
"I don't think the U.A.W. in a vacuum is going to be the big problem," Mr. Narayan said. "There are other problems these companies have."
A Ford executive said last week that the new contract would raise production costs by up to $ 900 a vehicle. The company said it would provide more details once workers ratified the contract.
The three large U.S. automakers are investing tens of billions of dollars to develop new electric vehicles, build battery plants and retool factories in an effort to catch up to Tesla, which is based in Austin, Texas, and has factories there and in Fremont, Calif.; Sparks, Nev.; and Buffalo. In addition to lower labor costs, the electric car company's advantages include selling cars directly to customers rather than through dealers, who take a slice of the profit from each sale of a car made by Ford, G.M. and Stellantis.
"We need to make sure we have a contract that is going to allow us to compete and win in what is a challenging market for E.V.s," Ms. Barra said last week.

A six-week wave of strikes that hobbled the three largest U.S. automakers has put workers on track for new contracts that will deliver the biggest pay raise workers will receive in decades while avoiding a protracted work stoppage that could have damaged the economy.
General Motors was firming up a deal with the United Auto Workers union Monday that was expected to mirror agreements the union reached in recent days with Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler.

Ford agreed on a tentative pact on Wednesday. Stellantis followed on Saturday. GM reached a tentative agreement on Monday, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deal before it was made public. Details of all the agreements had not yet been published, but they include a 25% pay increase over the next 4 1/2 years and provisions to make sure the raises are not eaten up by inflation.

Full text: The United Automobile Workers union announced the deal with Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram. It also expanded its strike against G.M.
The United Automobile Workers union announced on Saturday that it had reached a tentative agreement on a new labor contract with Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram.
The agreement came three days after the union and Ford Motor announced a tentative agreement on a new contract. The two deals contain many of the same or similar terms, including a 25 percent general wage increase for U.A.W. members as well as the possibility for cost-of-living wage adjustments if inflation flares.
"We have won a record-breaking contract," the U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, said in a video posted on Facebook. "We truly believe we got every penny possible out of the company."
Shortly after announcing the tentative agreement with Stellantis, the union expanded its strike against General Motors, calling on workers to walk off the job at the company's plant in Spring Hill, Tenn. The plant makes sport utility vehicles for G.M.'s Cadillac and GMC divisions.
Under the tentative new contract with Stellantis, Mr. Fain said, the company has agreed to reopen a plant in Belvidere, Ill., to produce a midsize pickup truck and to rehire enough workers to staff two shifts of production.
The union also won commitments to keep an engine plant in Trenton Mich., open, and to keep and expand a machining plant in Toledo, Ohio. According to the union, these moves will create up to 5,000 new U.A.W. jobs.
The union also won the right to strike if the company closes any plant and if it fails to follow through on its promised investment plans, Mr. Fain said.
"If the company goes back on their words on any plant, we can strike the hell out of them," he said.
Mr. Fain said Stellantis workers would now return to their jobs.
In a statement, Stellantis said, "We look forward to welcoming our 43,000 employees back to work and resuming operations to serve our customers."
The tentative agreement with Stellantis will require approval by a union council that oversees negotiations with the company, and then ratification by U.A.W. members. The council will meet on Thursday, Mr. Fain said.
The deal with Stellantis means that only General Motors has not yet reached an agreement with the U.A.W.
Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who follows the auto industry, said the new contracts impose higher labor costs on the Detroit manufacturers as they are ramping up production of electric vehicles and are competing with rivals who operate nonunion plants.
"The Detroit Three enter a new, dangerous era," he said. "They have to figure out how to transition to EVs and do it with a cost structure that puts them at a disadvantage with global competitors."
The union's contracts with the three automakers expired on Sept. 15. Since then, the union has called on more than 45,000 autoworkers at the three companies to walk off the job at factories and at 38 spare-parts warehouses across the country.
The most recent escalation of the strike at Stellantis came on Monday when the U.A.W. told workers to go on strike at a Ram plant in Sterling Heights, Mich., that makes the popular 1500 pickup truck. The strike has halted the production of Jeep Wranglers and Jeep Gladiators at a plant in Toledo, Ohio, and 20 Stellantis parts warehouses.
For decades, the union has negotiated similar contracts with all three automakers, a method known as pattern bargaining. Like the contract it hammered out with Ford, the tentative Stellantis deal would lift the top U.A.W. wage from $ 32 an hour to more than $ 40 over four and a half years. That would allow employees working 40 hours a week to earn about $ 84,000 a year.
Stellantis, G.M. and Ford began negotiating with the U.A.W. in July. The companies have sought to limit increases in labor costs because they already have higher labor costs than automakers like Tesla, Toyota and Honda that operate nonunion plants in the United States.
The three large U.S. automakers are also trying to control costs while investing tens of billions of dollars to develop new electric vehicles, build battery plants and retool factories.
Stellantis, which is based in Amsterdam, was created in 2021 by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, the French automaker. The company's North American business, based near Detroit, is its most profitable.
Stellantis surprised analysts recently by posting much stronger profits than G.M., which is the largest U.S. automaker by sales. Stellantis earned 11 billion euros ( $ 11.6 billion) in the first half of the year while G.M. made nearly $ 5 billion.

U.A.W. Deal Won't Put Ford At a Disadvantage, Analysts Say: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A tentative agreement gives union members at the carmaker their best terms in decades but could complicate Ford's electric vehicle plans.
When autoworkers went on strike in September, executives of the large U.S. automakers warned that union demands could significantly undermine their ability to compete in a fast-changing industry. The chief executive of Ford Motor said that the company might have to scrap its investment in electric vehicles.
The future doesn't look quite that bleak now that Ford and the United Automobile Workers union have reached a tentative agreement that is likely to serve as a template for deals the union eventually reaches with General Motors and Stellantis, the maker of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler.
Ford's costs will rise under the terms of the new contract, which includes a 25 percent raise over four and a half years, improved retirement benefits and other provisions. The extra expense will weigh on profit and could hamper Ford's ability to invest in new technology, John Lawler, the company's chief financial officer, said Thursday.
But some analysts said the increases should be manageable. What will matter more for the company's prospects, they said, is how innovative and efficient the company is in designing and producing cars and technology that can compete with offerings from Tesla, which dominates electric vehicles, the auto industry's fastest growing segment.
"They haven't agreed to anything that will kill their competitiveness," said Joshua Murray, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University who is an author of a book that examined how U.S. automakers lost ground to Japanese and European rivals. He said the deal could even help Ford, in part because the four-year contract ensures there would be no labor strife during an intense phase of the transition to electric vehicles.
"They won't be engaged in labor conflict while they're dealing with" the technology shift, Mr. Murray said.
Ford said on Thursday that it earned $ 1.2 billion from July through September on revenue of $ 44 billion; the company lost $ 827 million in the third quarter of 2022. But the division that makes electric vehicles lost $ 1.3 billion because of investments in new technology and increasing competition that has pushed down prices.
The roughly 17,000 Ford workers who had been on strike, out of a total of 57,000 U.A.W. employees at the company, are expected to begin returning to factories soon. At U.A.W. Local 900 in Wayne, Mich., across the street from a Ford plant that was one of the first three factories to be struck by the U.A.W., workers were disposing of signs, firewood and bottled water that had been stockpiled for picket lines.
"This is the best contract I have seen in my 30 years with Ford," said Robert Carter, 49, who works with engineers to lay out work stations on the assembly line. He said younger workers who had been earning well below the top wage of $ 32 an hour would see the biggest impact with the new contract; their pay would rise to more than $ 40 an hour over the next four and a half years.
"For some people, their pay is going to almost double," he said. "How can you say that's not huge?"
The reaction on Wall Street suggested that investors did not regard the agreement as a catastrophe. The carmaker's shares fell 1.7 percent during regular trading on Thursday.
But Ford stock slumped almost 5 percent in after-hours trading after the company said that, because of the cost of the strike, it could no longer stand by an earlier estimate that profit before interest expenses and taxes would be $ 11 billion to $ 12 billion in 2023. Mr. Lawler also said that strike would cost the company $ 1.3 billion this year.
Analysts at Barclays estimated the annual cost of pay raises, improved retirement benefits and other measures in the new union contract to be $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion annually by the end of the four-year contract period, or equivalent to about 1 percent of sales.
Mr. Lawler said on a conference call that the contract would raise the company's labor costs by an average of $ 850 to $ 900 per vehicle. He said Ford would try to "identify efficiencies and improve productivity to help us deliver on our targets" in light of those higher labor costs.
Some analysts were critical of the deal with the U.A.W., saying the cost to Ford could put it at a significant disadvantage, perhaps prompting the company to move more production to Mexico.
"It adds a constraint in a very competitive market," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive. "It's definitely a compromise that, I think, down the road will either limit Ford's performance or force them to consider alternatives."
During the contentious negotiations, Ford complained that a big raise for workers would put it even further behind Tesla in the electric vehicle market. Sales of Ford's two main battery-powered models, the F-150 Lightning truck and the Mustang Mach-E sport-utility vehicle, have been disappointing this year, and the company recently scaled back plans to increase production of the Lightning.
"There is tremendous downward pressure on E.V. pricing," Mr. Lawler said.
But Tesla and other automakers like Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan and Honda, whose factories in the United States do not have unions, may now face pressure to raise wages, eroding any cost advantage they might have had.
The U.A.W. has declared its intention to try to organize those factories. The pay agreement with Ford, by far the biggest boost in compensation that the union has won in decades, is likely to serve as a powerful advertisement for collective bargaining.
"Elon Musk better be looking at this," said Madeline Janis, executive director of Jobs to Move America, an advocacy group that has close ties to organized labor. "Hyundai and Toyota better be looking at this. This is a new era where workers are standing up."
Tesla, the company Mr. Musk runs, and other carmakers that don't have union workers in the United States, like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, may decide to pre-emptively hand out raises to keep labor organizers at bay.
"One strategy to deter union organizing is to raise wages," said Rebecca Kolins Givan, an associate professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University.
The decisive factor in the electric vehicle market will be the ability of Ford, G.M. and Stellantis to produce innovative products, Ms. Givan and others said. That is the responsibility of management, not assembly line workers.
"It's clear that these companies have work to do in the electric vehicle market," Ms. Givan said. "There is nothing in this contract that creates any constraints."
In addition to the 25 percent pay increase, the contract gives Ford's hourly workers cost-of-living wage adjustments, major gains on pensions and job security, and the right to strike over plant closings. The union had initially asked for a 40 percent wage increase.
Ford has not yet set dates for restarting plants idled by the strike. The company previously said it could take up to four weeks to reach full production. Ford also needs some 600 suppliers to resume production and to deliver parts.
"Bringing a plant back up is much more difficult than taking it down," Bryce Currie, vice president of Americas manufacturing at Ford, said this month.
Workers at the Wayne plant, which makes the Ranger pickup and the Bronco sport-utility vehicle, had not received return-to-work orders on Thursday, but they expected to be back on the assembly line next week.
Walter Robinson, 57, has worked at the Wayne plant for 34 years and expects to retire by the end of the new contract. But he said three of his children work for Ford and would see a big benefit from the new terms.
"My daughter has only been here two years, and it was going to take years for her to get the top wage," he said. "This is going to help her immensely. This is going to make all of their lives better."

After Wave of Walkouts, U.A.W. and Ford Reach a Tentative Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The deal, subject to approval by union members, could ease the way for deals with General Motors and Stellantis and end a growing wave of walkouts.
The United Automobile Workers and Ford Motor have reached a tentative agreement on a new four-year labor contract, the union announced Wednesday, nearly six weeks after the union began a growing wave of walkouts against the three Detroit automakers.
The union said the deal included a roughly 25 percent pay increase over four years, cost-of-living wage adjustments, major gains on pensions and job security, and the right to strike over plant closures. It called on striking Ford workers to go back to work while the tentative agreement awaits ratification.
Shawn Fain, the union president, said in a livestream on Facebook that the accord would be submitted to the U.A.W. council that oversees relations with Ford at a meeting in Detroit on Sunday. If the council approves, the union will submit the contract terms to the company's 57,000 union workers for their verdict.
"We made history," Mr. Fain said. "We told Ford to pony up, and they did." He said the terms included an immediate 11 percent wage increase upon ratification.
Ford issued a brief statement that said in part, "We are pleased to have reached a tentative agreement on a new labor contract with the U.A.W. covering our U.S. operations."
The union continues to negotiate with General Motors and Stellantis, whose brands include Chrysler, Jeep and Ram.
"We know it breaks records," Mr. Fain said of the tentative agreement with Ford. "We know it will change lives." But he underlined that it was up to union members to deliver the ultimate verdict.
Two weeks ago -- when it said it had reached the limit of what it could afford without hurting its business -- Ford offered to increase wages 23 percent, adjust pay in response to inflation and cut the time for new hires to rise to the top wage, to four years from eight. The other companies have made similar offers.
But the U.A.W. pressed for greater concessions, ratcheting up the walkouts and aiming them at factories producing some of the automakers' most profitable models.
"This is a major victory for the union after years of erosion by inflation, division by wage tiers and other real issues in the workplace that made people angry," said Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, who has followed the U.A.W. for more than three decades. "It sets a standard for other workers throughout the economy."
President Biden, who had championed the union's cause and joined a picket line on a visit to Michigan last month, hailed the accord. "I applaud the U.A.W. and Ford for coming together after a hard-fought, good-faith negotiation and reaching a historic tentative agreement," he said.
The union said the agreement would ultimately lift the top wage to more than $ 40 an hour, giving a member working 40 hours a week a base pay of more than $ 83,000, not including overtime and profit-sharing bonuses, which were more than $ 14,000 in 2022.
The current top wage is $ 32 an hour, or about $ 67,000 a year based on a 40-hour week.
Recent hires who make considerably less than the top wage will see their pay nearly double over the life of the contract, the union said.
The tentative deal with Ford could increase pressure on the other companies to reach an agreement with the union. In the past, once the union reached a deal with one automaker, tentative agreements with the others quickly followed. But that history may not be as relevant now because the U.A.W. had never struck all three companies simultaneously until this year.
Altogether, about 45,000 workers at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis are on strike across the country, including 8,700 workers at Ford's Kentucky truck plant in Louisville, the company's largest, and almost 10,000 others at Ford factories in Illinois and Michigan.
The companies are investing billions in a transition to battery-powered vehicles, a financial commitment that they say makes it harder for them to pay substantially higher wages. Last week, Ford's executive chairman, William C. Ford Jr., said the union's demands risked damaging the ability of Detroit automakers to compete against nonunion companies like Tesla and foreign rivals.
"Toyota, Honda, Tesla and the others are loving the strike, because they know the longer it goes on, the better it is for them," he said. "They will win, and all of us will lose."
The U.A.W. makes a different case: that success in its contract battle with the Big Three will give it momentum to organize autoworkers at other companies as well.
It began its walkouts when the companies' union contracts expired in mid-September. It won immediate support from Mr. Biden, who called on the automakers to "ensure record corporate profits mean record contracts" and briefly joined workers on a picket line at a G.M. plant near Detroit late last month.
The union initially demanded a 40 percent wage increase over four years -- an amount that union officials have said matches the raises the top executives at the three companies have received over the last four years. Those raises are also meant to compensate for more modest increases the autoworkers received in recent years and concessions the union made to the companies beginning in 2007.
In addition, the union called for an end to a system that pays new hires just over half of the top wage of $ 32 an hour. It demanded adjustments that would nudge wages higher to compensate for inflation. And it wanted a reinstatement of pensions for all workers, improved retiree benefits and shorter work hours.
G.M. and Stellantis faced the most recent escalation of the U.A.W. walkouts when the union called out 6,800 workers at a large Ram pickup truck plant in Michigan on Monday and 5,000 workers at a G.M. plant in Arlington, Texas. That factory makes large sport utility vehicles including the Chevrolet Tahoe, the GMC Yukon and the Cadillac Escalade.
"Ford knew what was coming for them on Wednesday if we didn't get a deal," Mr. Fain said. "That was checkmate."
On Tuesday, G.M. reported a third-quarter profit of $ 3.1 billion, a 7 percent decline from a year earlier, owing in part to the strike. Ford is scheduled to announce its third-quarter earnings on Thursday.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The three U.S. automakers say they are already at a disadvantage to nonunion rivals while labor leaders hope that big gains in negotiations will inspire workers in Southern states to unionize.
Tens of thousands of people who work for Toyota in Kentucky, Mercedes-Benz in Alabama or Tesla in Texas are technically not involved in the high-stakes negotiations taking place between labor and management in and around Detroit.
But they are very much a presence.
Executives at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, invoke nonunion automakers, many of them in the South, as a competitive threat that makes it impossible for them to meet striking workers' demands for big raises, more generous benefits and better working conditions.
"Toyota, Honda, Tesla and others are loving this strike because they know the longer it goes on, the better it is for them," Bill Ford, the executive chair of Ford Motor, said in Michigan last week. "They will win, and all of us will lose."
The United Automobile Workers union sees such statements as an attempt to play workers off one another. It views the strikes, entering their sixth week, as a first step toward better pay for not only U.A.W. members but also the nonunion workers that it plans to recruit in the future.
"We won't be used in this phony competition," Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, said on Friday, reacting to Mr. Ford's speech. He added, "Nonunion autoworkers are not the enemy. Those are our future union family."
The pay gap between union and nonunion factories has long been a point of contention. Some industry executives have argued that high union wages were a big reason G.M. and Chrysler had to resort to bankruptcy after the 2008 financial crisis.
Union leaders and progressive lawmakers have asserted that the growth of nonunion manufacturing, mostly in the South but also in the Midwest and West, has helped to erode the middle class over the past several decades.
Veteran union autoworkers tend to make more than production workers who are not represented by unions. They often have more say in their schedules and overtime work.
But starting pay at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis factories can be lower than at nonunion factories. And the pay of nonunion workers at Southern auto plants tends to go further because the cost of living there is lower than it is in the Midwest.
Even the geographic divide between union and nonunion plant is not always as clear as it may seem. Toyota and Honda have plants in the South, where unions are weak, but they also have factories in Ohio and Indiana, where unions are stronger. And G.M. and Ford have union operations in Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas.
The debate about auto industry wages has become more urgent as automakers invest billions to build factories that produce batteries for electric cars. Most of those factories are being built in Southern states, like Georgia and Tennessee, where local laws make it more difficult for unions to organize a factory.
"A good agreement with the Detroit Three would be powerful because it gives union organizers better arguments for joining the union," said Ian Greer, a Cornell research professor who studies the effect of electric vehicles on labor.
Even with a union wage of almost $ 32 an hour from her job assembling chassis at a Ford factory in Chicago, Schataan Lyke said she did not have it easy. She is the sole breadwinner for three children and worries about how to afford a prom dress for her oldest.
Ms. Lyke, who has been on strike, said she was glad to have the union behind her. "You've got someone on the outside fighting for you," she said.
But Ms. Lyke, 37, has it better than people doing similar work in the South. At a Nissan factory in Canton, Miss., Morris Mock, 49, makes about $ 1 less than Ms. Lyke per hour even with more than 20 years of experience, he said.
An attempt to unionize Nissan in 2017 failed to win enough support from workers. That means Mr. Mock, one of the people who led the union drive, will not benefit directly from the contract that the U.A.W. works out with automakers. But he said he was glad the union was fighting to protect wages as the industry switched to electric vehicles.
"The market is about to change," Mr. Mock said. "I'm glad that they understand that we must put workers first."
Government statistics suggest wide regional pay gaps. Michigan autoworkers make 22 percent more than production workers in Tennessee, 23 percent more than South Carolina workers and 28 percent more than Alabama workers, according to a Census Bureau survey. Those figures include people who work for suppliers, where pay is often lower than in factories that assemble vehicles.
Some labor experts said the bigger difference between union and nonunion autoworkers had less to do with pay and more with things like mandatory overtime and the scheduling of shifts. Union workers tend to have more say in those matters.
The auto industry has been moving South for decades, drawn by lower costs, weak unions and local government incentives. Foreign automakers have often chosen sites in the South when they set up factories in the United States. BMW and Volvo Cars have factories in South Carolina; Mercedes and Hyundai in Alabama; Toyota in Kentucky; and Volkswagen in Tennessee.
Most of the foreign automakers do not disclose what they pay their workers. Volkswagen, an exception, said the starting pay at its factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., was $ 21.10 for hourly production workers. Veteran workers earn more than $ 29, the company said.
Foreign automakers concentrated in the South sometimes pay their U.S. workers more than Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, according to a study by EY for Autos Drive America, an industry association that represents Nissan, Toyota, Mercedes and others.
The average starting wage at foreign automakers was $ 19 an hour, the survey said, more than the $ 17 starting wage for U.A.W. members. But the average maximum pay at the foreign automakers was $ 28, compared with $ 32 for U.A.W. members under the current contract.
A Nissan spokesman declined to say how much the company pays its U.S. workers, but he said the average was higher than that reported by the Autos Drive America survey.
Tesla, which is based in Texas and has factories there and in Buffalo; Fremont, Calif.; and Sparks, Nev., does not disclose what it pays its workers, but the Detroit automakers say it is less than what they pay.
Ford has said its labor costs, including benefits and bonuses, are 40 percent more per worker than Tesla's. That figure does not include stock awards that at least some Tesla employees receive. On Tesla's website, job advertisements for a production associate pay $ 20 to $ 23 an hour.
Even if autoworker pay in Alabama or Mississippi is less than what it is in Michigan or Illinois, it is often more than what employers in other industries pay in those places.
Working conditions are often a bigger issue than pay, labor representatives say.
In February, Emily Erickson of the University of Warwick in England and Berneece Herbert of Jackson State University published a survey of 211 workers at Mercedes's factory in Vance, Ala., near Tuscaloosa.
The workers reported earning an average of $ 27 an hour at Mercedes, high for the region. But they said they were forced to work overtime or change their work schedules with little notice. Almost half worked more than 50 hours a week. The study also found that white workers made an average of $ 3 more per hour than Black workers.
Mercedes denied that it discriminates. "Our pay structure is equal for all team members regardless of race, age or ethnic origin, and our pay progressions are based on seniority," the company said in a statement.
It noted that the company employed 6,000 people in Alabama, suggesting that the study sampled too few workers. "We do not agree with its conclusions," Mercedes said.
The gulf between pay in the South and the North is certain to widen when Ford, G.M. and Stellantis agree on new contracts with the U.A.W. The union is demanding a 40 percent increase over four years. Ford, G.M. and Stellantis have already offered raises of 23 percent and could go higher.
Unions have made some progress in the South recently. Workers at Blue Bird, which makes school buses in Georgia, voted to join the United Steelworkers in May and are negotiating a contract. Workers at ZF, which makes axles for Mercedes in Alabama, ended a monthlong strike last week after the German company agreed to raise the top hourly wage to $ 23.
Labor leaders say they have already been deluged with calls from workers at Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai who expressed interest in organizing unions. Workers at Volkswagen voted not to join the union in 2019, but the environment may be different this time.
"These workers will say, 'Look what the U.A.W. did for these workers at G.M., Ford and Stellantis,"' said Tim Smith, director of U.A.W. Region 8, which includes all of the Southeast.
"We've got organizers on the ground there right now," he said. "We're starting to make our move."

Autoworkers Widen Strike To Key Plant For S.U.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United Automobile Workers on Tuesday expanded its strike to General Motors' largest U.S. plant a day after striking at a Ram truck plant.
The United Automobile Workers union shut down production at General Motors' largest U.S. factory on Tuesday, significantly stepping up pressure on the large U.S. automakers as signs multiplied that the six-week strike is taking a toll on profits.
The union told 5,000 workers at G.M.'s plant in Arlington, Texas, to stop working on the same day that the automaker announced a drop in its third-quarter profit and said U.A.W. work stoppages, which have also hit Ford Motor and Stellantis, had cost it $ 800 million so far.
The strike in Arlington continued the union's strategy of targeting some of the carmaker's most profitable vehicles. The Texas factory makes large sport utility vehicles including the Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade.
Before the Tuesday expansion, there had been signs that the union and G.M. were close to an agreement. Some analysts said the union's decision to raise the stakes was part of an endgame strategy to squeeze the last dollar from the company.
The U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, "has been saying he still had some levers to pull to push the companies, and now he's pulling them," said Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. "So I think this is the union's final push to the companies, saying, 'Let's get this deal done."'
But it is also possible the companies and the union are still far from striking deals and the U.A.W. is demonstrating that it still has plenty of cards to play.
"My gut feeling is that they're not close and this is trying to impose more cost and say, 'Look, you guys have to get closer to what we want or we'll keeping doing this,"' said Patricia Anderson, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College.
On Monday, the union struck a Ram pickup truck plant, the largest U.S. factory operated by Stellantis, which also owns Jeep and Chrysler. The U.A.W. has also struck Ford Motor's largest plant, in Louisville, Ky., which produces large pickup trucks and the Lincoln Navigator S.U.V.
"Another record quarter, another record year; as we've said for months: record profits equal record contracts," Mr. Fain said in a statement. "It's time G.M. workers, and the whole working class, get their fair share."
G.M. executives had said earlier on Tuesday that they hoped to reach a tentative agreement with the union soon. The Texas walkout dimmed those hopes.
The longer the strike lasts, the greater the risk it will become a drag on the U.S. economy, or make it harder for consumers to find the vehicles they want.
The automakers have been keen to point out the ripple effects that the strikes are having on other workers. Stellantis, the maker of Chrysler and Jeep, said on Tuesday that it laid off 525 workers at two Michigan factories, in Sterling and Warren, that make parts for Ram pickup trucks that are not needed while the assembly line is shut down by the strike.
All told, Stellantis has temporarily laid off more than 2,000 workers because of the strikes. Ford has laid off more than 3,000 workers because of the strike, according to the company. G.M. has laid off about 2,500, including about 140 at a factory in Ohio who made parts for the factory in Arlington and were let go on Tuesday. Another 3,000 workers at G.M. suppliers are temporarily out of work because of the strike, according to the company.
"We are disappointed by the escalation of this unnecessary and irresponsible strike," G.M. said in a statement. "It is harming our team members who are sacrificing their livelihoods and having negative ripple effects on our dealers, suppliers and the communities that rely on us."
G.M., the largest automaker based in the United States, said on Tuesday that the strike was partly to blame for a 7 percent decline in profit from a year earlier. The company reported that it earned $ 3.1 billion from July through September. Including the Texas factory, the strike has idled three of the company's vehicle plants and 18 spare-parts warehouses.
Before the U.A.W. expanded the strike, G.M. said Tuesday that work stoppages had lowered its earnings before interest and taxes by about $ 200 million in the final weeks of the third quarter and by about $ 600 million since the fourth quarter started on Oct. 1. The automaker estimated that the strike could cost it $ 200 million a week, though that number will likely grow now that workers at the Texas plant are on strike.
"They've demanded a record contract -- and that's exactly what we've offered for weeks now: a historic contract with record wage increases, record job security and world-class health care," the company's chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in a letter to investors. "It's an offer that rewards our team members but does not put our company and their jobs at risk."
G.M. has offered workers a 23 percent increase in pay over four years, lifting the standard wage for veteran employees to more than $ 40 an hour from $ 32; newer workers earn a lower rate. Employees working 40 hours a week at the top rate would earn about $ 84,000 a year, not including extra pay for overtime or profit-sharing bonuses, which have topped $ 10,000 in the past two years.
Ford and Stellantis have made similar offers.
The union had initially demanded raises of 40 percent, saying that more modest increases will not make up for the erosion in living standards that its members have suffered from inflation and from concessions they made in past contracts.
Mr. Fain has taken a more confrontational approach to negotiations than his predecessors. He has portrayed talks with G.M., Ford and Stellantis as the first step in a broad effort to organize workers at Tesla, Toyota, Honda and other companies which do not have unions at their U.S. factories.
In a video streamed online on Friday, Mr. Fain said that G.M., Ford and Stellantis had not yet put their best offer on the table. "Despite all the bluster about how much the companies have stretched," he said, "there's clearly still room to move."
Ms. Anderson noted that Mr. Fain was newly elected, in March, and that there was a risk he could have miscalculated. "The U.A.W. president is new and not very experienced," she said. "He may be holding out for an unrealistic settlement that just may be costly for both parties, and ending up where they could have settled today."
Striking the automakers' largest and most profitable plants sends a signal to union members that the U.A.W. leaders have done everything in their power to get the best deal, Mr. Wheaton of Cornell said.
"This shows the members that, 'Look, we took out their biggest moneymakers and pushed them hard as we could,"' he said. "Then, if there is a tentative deal, they can tell the members: 'You better ratify this. Don't vote this down."'
This month, nearly 4,000 U.A.W. members at Mack Trucks voted down a tentative agreement that the U.A.W. negotiated with the company, a subsidiary of Volvo Trucks, and went on strike. Union officials are now seeking to secure better terms from the company.
The calendar is probably also an important consideration. Mr. Fain and the union's negotiators have to be careful about asking workers to go into the colder months and the holiday season with only the $ 500 a week in strike pay, Mr. Wheaton said.
"Walking a picket line in November in Detroit is no fun," he said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As a 25-year-old junior executive at the car company that bears his last name, William Clay Ford Jr. had a bracing introduction to labor negotiations when a union official demanded that he stand up and vouch that he was made of the same stuff as his great-grandfather Henry Ford.
Mr. Ford, now the company's executive chair, harked back to the moment in an interview this week about how he and his company are navigating one of their most difficult labor negotiations in decades.
The United Automobile Workers union has shut down three Ford plants, including its largest, and other plants and distribution centers at General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler. The union's new president, Shawn Fain, has said he is prepared to call workers out at more plants if his demands for big raises, better benefits and job security are not met. He has referred to the companies as "the enemy," and has said the union is fighting "corporate greed" and standing up to the "billionaire class."
In a speech this week, Mr. Ford said the strikes were helping nonunion automakers like Tesla, Toyota and Honda. Mr. Fain responded that workers at those companies were future U.A.W. members.
In an interview after his speech, Mr. Ford said he had been counseling his executives not to let Mr. Fain's words get to them and focus on getting a deal done. Mr. Ford also recalled his first difficult conversation with a union official.
In 1982, Mr. Ford said, his father invited him to sit in the room for talks with the U.A.W. As a newcomer, he was not allotted a seat at a table where about 50 union negotiators sat on one side and an equal number of Ford executives on the other.
Sitting against the wall, he was approached by an older union representative. "You, stand up," the man said. "What are you made of? I knew your great-grandfather and your grandfather. I knew what they were made of. What the hell are you made of?"
Mr. Ford said he had replied sheepishly that he had never known his great-grandfather and grandfather but that he shared their values. Similar confrontations followed daily -- "I lived in terror of going to work," Mr. Ford said.
Then about a week later, the union officials invited him to a local bar. "Come with us," Mr. Ford said they had told him. "You passed the test."
This interview was condensed and edited for clarity.
Have you been involved in any talks that are comparable to the current negotiations?
No, but every negotiation is different, and every leader is different. What I keep saying to our executives is: 'Don't take this personally. A lot of it is theater. The most important thing is get the deal done. The rhetoric doesn't matter.' Every negotiation is a roller coaster. Some are not pleasant, and some sting. Don't overreact. And when it's all over, we are still one team again, and have to go forward.
Are you going to be on the same team at the end of these talks?
I believe we will. I know many on their negotiating team personally, and some of them, I play hockey with them and consider them very close friends.
You've said the real competition is not U.A.W. vs. Ford but the U.A.W. and Ford against Toyota, Honda, Tesla and the Chinese automakers. Do you think the union's leadership agrees with that?
I hope so, because if they don't, it will be catastrophic. They can have disagreements with us and bargain hard, but we are not the enemy. I will never consider our employees the enemy. I think the employees know who the real competition is, and they will come together with us when this is over. We made a conscious decision to add jobs here in America when our competitors were moving production to Mexico.
Would the offer you have on the table now put Ford at a significant disadvantage to other automakers?
It certainly won't be an advantage. We could live with the deal we have proposed, but just barely. If you go beyond that, we are going to have to start making hard decisions in terms of investments and future products.
Shawn Fain has said the workers have fallen behind while the automakers and executives like Jim Farley, Ford's chief executive, and Mary Barra, G.M.'s chief executive, have prospered. How do you respond?
Everyone's going to have their own viewpoint on executive compensation, and I totally get that. But I also know what the market is for top talent. You have entertainers and athletes who are making more than Jim Farley and Mary Barra. But that's what the market is, and the company with the best talent wins, period.
There were some years in the lean years when I took no pay, and I would do it again if I had to.
You have three plants shut down by the strike. How is that affecting your operations?
It's messy, and it's going to become messier. The most immediate effects will be on the suppliers. The supply base is very fragile. It barely survived Covid, and is not all the way back, so a prolonged strike will start collapsing the supply base, and then making anything in this country will be difficult.
Manufacturing is a matter of national security, and we saw that during Covid. And I hope with all my heart we never get into another war, but if we did, this industry would be critical to defending our nation, as it was in World War I and World War II. Other industries can make small numbers of things. The auto companies can turn that into tens of thousands of things.
"I never thought I would see the day when our products were so heavily politicized, but they are." -- William Clay Ford Jr.
What's your outlook on the U.S. economy?
I think it's fragile. Inflation is taking its toll. The consumer is still spending, but we're watching it very carefully. On the other hand, there's still strong employment, and we are seeing our sales hold up. There are conflicting signals, for sure.
Let's talk about electric vehicles. About 18 months ago, you launched the F-150 Lightning pickup. It seemed like electric vehicle sales were going to take off. But now Ford is slowing production of that truck. What happened?
E.V. sales are still up 50 percent this year, so sales are growing very fast. But we've also seen a politicization of E.V.s. Blue states say E.V.s are great and we need to adopt them as soon as possible for climate reasons. Some of the red states say this is just like the vaccine, and it's being shoved down our throat by the government, and we don't want it. I never thought I would see the day when our products were so heavily politicized, but they are.
The other is prices. Electric vehicles are expensive. We know prices will come down, and as that happens, we will have a bigger ramp-up of E.V.s. Keep this in mind: The most valuable company that our industry has ever seen is Tesla, and it's growing. That's a very instructive point when people say E.V.s are not desired.
Are you concerned about some of Donald Trump's comments? He just came into Michigan and said that the transition to electric vehicles is going to result in almost all auto production moving to China.
I don't want to personalize this, because, frankly, we have to pick a path forward and our lead times are longer than political lead times. So we can't overreact to one bit of rhetoric or another. We have to deal with the most likely scenario, and how we can create the most value for our company, so we are pushing ahead with E.V.s because we do believe they have great application for a lot of people. And once people drive E.V.s, they will see that it's a great experience.
Electric vehicles are expensive. Did Tesla's price cuts have a big effect on your business?
That's what we have seen with every new technology that has been adapted. You come down the cost curve pretty quickly as batteries get better.
With our first-generation E.V.s, the Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, they were done with a lot of internal combustion engineering in them. The next generation, which will start coming quite quickly, was developed with a clean sheet of paper. When you do that you can really start taking cost out, and then you can start pricing them accordingly.
Tesla has been leading the price cuts, because they can with their scale. That's something we are actually counting on in the future. And we will have products that compete and make money in that world.

Tesla Profit Plunges 44% As Musk Cites Challenges: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The automaker reported a sharp drop in profits in the third quarter after slashing car prices by around 25 percent in an attempt to compete.
Tesla's profit slumped in the third quarter, disappointing Wall Street expectations, after the carmaker cut prices to maintain its dominance of the market for electric vehicles.
Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, also dashed hopes that a new model called the Cybertruck would quickly revive earnings, warning that the pickup truck would take at least 18 months to become profitable after it goes on sale at the end of November.
The company reported a net profit of $ 1.9 billion from July through September, a 44 percent drop from the $ 3.3 billion Tesla made in the same three-month period a year earlier.
Saying he wanted to "temper expectations," Mr. Musk warned on Wednesday during a conference call with financial analysts and investors that "there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with Cybertruck and making the Cybertruck cash flow positive."
He added, "The blood, sweat and tears that will be required to achieve that is just staggering."
The company has slashed car prices by around 25 percent in the United States during the last year, putting the priority on sales rather than profit. The least expensive version of Tesla's best selling car, the Model Y sport-utility vehicle, now starts at $ 44,000 before government incentives, or roughly as much as the comparable Toyota RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid, which has an electric motor and a gasoline engine.
"We continue to believe that an industry leader needs to be a cost leader," Tesla said in a statement.
Despite the cuts, Tesla's share of the electric vehicle market in the United States slumped to 50 percent in the third quarter from 60 percent in the first quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book. BMW, Mercedes, Hyundai, General Motors and other automakers have been introducing new electric vehicles at a rapid clip, eroding Tesla's dominance.
Tesla is also facing stiffer competition in China and Europe, two large markets for battery-powered cars, from local automakers.
Analysts had expected a decline in profit after Tesla said earlier this month that sales fell in the third quarter because of temporary factory shutdowns to retool assembly lines at factories in Austin, Texas, and Shanghai. But the slump was greater than expected.
At least until recently, Tesla was more profitable than established U.S. automakers, allowing it to cut prices. "I view it as a way to defend market share at the expense of margin," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online auto sales site.
The company may not be able to continue cutting prices indefinitely. Its net profit margin in the third quarter was 8 percent, in line with that of traditional carmakers.
Investors had been hoping that the Cybertruck pickup would revive sales. The company said Wednesday that it expected to begin deliveries of the vehicle on Nov. 30, two years behind schedule.
Mr. Musk acknowledged that Tesla was facing severe challenges mass producing the vehicle, which has an unusual stainless-steel body. The material resists rust and does not need to be painted, but is much more difficult to shape and weld.
"We dug our own grave with Cybertruck," Mr. Musk said.
Ford Motor, Rivian and General Motors have reported lackluster sales of electric pickup trucks after an initial surge in customer interest, suggesting that the market for such vehicles may not be quite as big as industry executives and analysts had once thought. This week, G.M. said it would delay by a year plans to start producing electric pickups at a factory in Michigan, and Ford said it was slowing production of its F-150 Lightning truck.
Mr. Musk insisted that demand for the Cybertruck was "off the charts" and that more than one million people have placed orders. But he noted that higher interest rates have led to higher monthly loan payments, reducing consumers' ability to buy new cars.
"We have to make it at a price that people can afford," he said.
Tesla could benefit if the United Automobile Workers strike against Ford, G.M. and Stellantis expands to more factories. So far, workers at six plants owned by the three companies have walked off the job. Tesla workers do not belong to a union.
Tesla's stock price, which fell nearly 5 percent in regular trading on Wednesday, was down another 3 percent in extended trading after Mr. Musk's conference call.
"I'm not saying things will be bad," he said of the economy, "but I'm saying they might be."

Caught in the Middle, They Live in Their Cars: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Chrystal Audet tried to get comfortable in what she called her "bedroom" -- the back seat of her eight-year-old Ford Fusion. To stretch her legs, she had to leave a passenger door ajar, but September nights are raw in the Pacific Northwest, with sheets of rain that cut to the bone.
From her own "bedroom" in the front seat, her 26-year-old daughter Cierra Audet asked her to close it.
"We have to get out of this," Ms. Audet said to herself as she pulled a comforter against the cold and struggled to fall asleep in a parking lot in Kirkland, Wash.
Ms. Audet, 49, earns over $ 72,000 a year as a social worker for the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services. But a combination of bad luck, bad debt and a bad credit score priced her out of her apartment in Bellevue, another suburb of Seattle, one of the most expensive housing markets in the country. With an eviction looming, she put her furniture in storage this spring and began parking the sedan in a U-shaped parking lot outside a church in Kirkland.
The car, her biggest investment, became her home -- the roof turned into a dining table, the trunk a closet. And a weathered stretch of blacktop provided by a Methodist church became her yard, her neighborhood and her safe place.
Around the country, real estate is being set aside for people like Ms. Audet in the form of parking lots. Dozens of such lots have opened in the last five years, with new ones being announced every few months, including as far east as Pennsylvania and North Carolina. They are sprinkled across the Midwest in Green Bay, Wis., and Duluth, Minn. And they dot the spine of the Pacific Northwest, providing a safe harbor for a growing cohort of working Americans who are wedged in the unforgiving middle. They earn too little to afford rent but too much to receive government assistance and have turned their cars into a form of affordable housing.
The idea of providing a parking lot for homeless parkers is nearly two decades old, with the first known lot opening in the shadow of Santa Barbara's mansions in 2004. But the idea didn't take off nationally for some time.
The Lake Washington United Methodist Church began experimenting with offering a beachhead for the "mobile homeless" in 2011 in response to Seattle's "scofflaw ordinance," which called for the impounding of cars that had accrued multiple parking tickets, a law that was disastrous for people forced to live in their cars. "Our simple idea was, 'Hey, if they're in our parking lot, they won't get parking tickets. And they won't get booted and towed,"' said Karina O'Malley, who helped create the program.
Now it is one of 12 in Washington State.
"Tens of thousands of people are living in their vehicles," said Graham J. Pruss, an applied anthropologist studying the trend, who heads the National Vehicle Residency Collective. "It's huge."
'One Bill Too Many'
In 2001, Ms. Audet posted a bad check. It went to court and ended up on her record, one of several setbacks that have damaged her credit.
Her free fall into unsustainable debt began last December when her car made a horrible, sputtering sound, and died. With poor credit, the only loan she could find came at a punishing cost: For the 2015 Ford Fusion with over 100,000 miles, she is being charged interest of 27.99 percent, equaling a payment of $ 398 per month, one-tenth of her take-home pay.
Medical bills in the thousands arrived for her Crohn's disease. She missed two rent payments. And then the landlord raised her rent $ 248 a month.
"It was a case of one bill too many," Ms. Audet said.
Down the spiral that led her to homelessness were a series of forks -- choices between bad and very bad that she made, many in moments of desperation. She spent a week at a hotel. Expedia offered to break up her payments, which she is now paying off at the rate of $ 138 a month. To avoid her unpaid rent going to collections, she signed an installment plan, agreeing to pay $ 495 per month.
By midsummer, Ms. Audet's take-home pay of nearly $ 4,300 a month was hollowed out by bills totaling nearly $ 2,600, leaving her with too little to pay for an apartment in a market where the median rent is $ 2,200.
She finally found the parking lot after seeing a news story about parking programs for homeless people. A tiny house is typically 300 square feet. For months, Ms. Audet, her daughter and their cream-colored mutt Coda lived out of a space that was no more than 30 square feet.
The fact that she was able to hang on to her car allowed her to maintain a semblance of normalcy. Almost no one knew her secret. Each morning, Ms. Audet used a portable toilet to get ready for work, then commuted to the downtown Seattle office of the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, where she spent her day sitting behind a plexiglass partition across from some of the city's most destitute residents.
"There's no judgment here," she told the desperate people seeking government assistance, including a man clutching a medical certificate proving that he is blind. She helped him qualify for disability benefits. "It could be me on the other side of this glass," she told them.
She, in fact, was on the other side of the glass -- her bank account overdrawn by more than $ 900, a black hole of loans and bills that ate up her paycheck the moment it landed. Because she spent her days assisting others, she knew that she earned too much to be helped herself: The cutoff for receiving housing assistance in King County is 80 percent of the median income, or $ 70,650, said Benjamin Maritz, a member of the King County Regional Homelessness Authority Implementation Board.
In many cities, the "mobile homeless" are now the majority of the homeless population -- people living out of vehicles make up about 53 percent in King County, Washington, where Ms. Audet lives. About 45 percent in San Mateo, a county perched on California's rugged northern cliffs, are in the same predicament. In Los Angeles, the number approaches 60 percent.
Many of them have jobs: In Denver, 135 out of the 217 people who slept in one of the lots provided by the Colorado Safe Parking Initiative earlier this year earned an average of $ 1,581 a month. One-bedrooms there average $ 1,655.
After losing his job in January as a purchasing agent for a gardening company in Denver, Josh, 37, who asked that he be identified by his first name only because he had not told his family about his predicament, moved into his Toyota RAV 4. Finding somewhere safe to park was a daily struggle: "I was bouncing around between gyms, hotel parking lots, light industrial areas and the side streets off of hotels or apartments," he said. Soon after, he learned he had colon cancer.
One night, when he was sleeping outside a Planet Fitness, he woke up to a man trying to break in. He left after Josh pushed the emergency button on his key fob. On another night when it was snowing, he parked in the lot of a Super 8 motel and found tracks leading to his car and the snow sheared from one of the car's handles the next morning.
He called the Colorado Safe Parking Initiative, one of the newest in the country which operates thirteen lots in Denver, and begged the operator for a spot.
Josh now lives in one of the lots and commutes to his chemotherapy appointments.
There are so many people in need of a place to park that most are turned away. "We can only serve 10 to 20 percent of the people who call us," said the executive director, Terrell Curtis.
In other parking lots across the country, car dwellers shared the hardships that landed them there: A man who scraped by delivering pizzas in Santa Barbara ended up in his Nissan Frontier when the pizza parlor cut his hours. A 35-year-old who installed home security systems ended up in his Chevy Suburban when he lost control of the drill, snapping his radial tendon. And one woman said she had to choose between helping her mother or herself.
"The rent just kept going up and up and up," said Brooke Rosales, 41, describing how she and her mother shared an apartment in Lakewood, Colo., scraping by through a delicate lean-to of wages and disability benefits. Ms. Rosales suffers from grand mal seizures while her mother has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
It came crashing down when the mother's condition progressed and she was no longer able to work. Sandy Rosales, 64, now struggles to breathe. Unable to make rent, the mother moved in with her son.
There was no room for Brooke Rosales, who ended up in her Jeep Liberty at a lot for homeless parkers in Denver.
Shame
To try to stay ahead of the tsunami of bills, Ms. Audet worked two jobs. On a recent evening, after clocking out at the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, Ms. Audet took Bus No. 554 back to Kirkland, where her daughter, a college student, waited for her. They spent the next three hours delivering food through DoorDash, breaking for dinner and picking up the next day. The pair earned $ 86.05 that evening, then spent $ 20 on gas and $ 20.37 at a waffle place for a takeout dinner.
They ate in the empty parking lot of a middle school, the Styrofoam container laid out on the roof of the Ford.
"It's the irony of working and making a nice income and still not being able to afford housing," Ms. Audet said. "I make $ 32 and some change per hour, but even still, I find myself struggling."
To bathe, Ms. Audet and her daughter headed to a state park the next morning. It's inside a 489-acre forest of Douglas firs crisscrossed by trails. They found that the parking lot was roped off -- an equestrian competition was underway. So they parked on the highway, across from the park entrance, next to a "Tow Away Area" sign. She and her daughter took turns walking across the highway with their toiletries; one person needed to stay with the car to make sure it wasn't towed.
Ms. Audet padded across the two-lane road in the pajamas she had slept in the night before. She had bought a bucket at the drugstore in order to carry her lotions, but on this particular morning she decided to leave it in the trunk, carrying her creams, her razor and her rosewater body wash in her arms, covered by a towel.
"I didn't want to draw attention to myself," she whispered, as she passed teenage girls leading shiny horses with braided manes.
On the door of the public shower, someone had taped a real estate listing to the wall, advertising a $ 4.25 million home. It was walking distance away and featured a three-stall barn, custom millwork and heated floors. Six miles from the public restroom where Ms. Audet showers is the exclusive community where Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos live.
Calculated Omission
There are so many ways in which a person's life becomes smaller when they are forced to fit a home into a car. To avoid using the portable toilet at night, Ms. Audet tried to limit how much water she drank, leading to dehydration. The fact that she couldn't properly stretch out caused her ankles to swell to the point that she couldn't fit into her tennis shoes. Mother and daughter draped sheets over the car's windows to try to have a measure of privacy at night. When it rained, the sheets got wet and with nowhere to dry them out, they became moldy.
In between working two jobs and navigating the church parking lot and the public shower, Ms. Audet found time to search for apartments. She was presented with the impossible math of her life: Her pay stubs presented one picture -- that of a woman earning a respectable income -- but as soon as the apartment managers pulled her credit report, their expressions changed, she said. With a score of 562, considered "Very Poor" by credit reporting agencies, she was asked to find a co-signer, or else provide multiple months of deposits. She didn't have so much as the first month's rent.
Her luck changed in late August at an event inside the church, when housing activists noticed that she was being trailed by a Times reporter. Several offered their business cards. One coached her on how to approach potential landlords -- what to share and what to omit.
Soon after, she toured a $ 2,360-a-month one-bedroom in Redmond, Wash. At 673 square feet, it was a palace: Bright, white countertops and shiny floors stretched over floor space 20 times the size of her car.
A calculated omission -- one that she wasn't proud of but felt necessary as winter approached -- allowed her to clear the first hurdle. On the form requesting two years of rental history, she left off her most recent apartment. Because she had entered into a payment agreement, the unpaid rent did not appear on her credit report.
She was nearly in tears when she heard that she had been approved, but almost lost the apartment when she couldn't provide the security deposit. The church where she had been parking stepped in, ending her homelessness for a little more than $ 2,000.
Ms. Audet and her daughter moved in on Sept. 23. For now she is relishing the simplest of human pleasures -- the ability to drink as much water as she wants, to take a shower in a space that is fully hers and to stretch out when she sleeps. Her tennis shoes fit again. Yet the math of her life remains precarious. Her sizable debt continues to carve out her salary, leaving too little for rent.

Full text: Mr. Ford, the executive chairman of Ford Motor, said nonunion automakers would make gains against Michigan automakers because of strikes by the United Automobile Workers union.
The monthlong strike by the United Automobile Workers and the union's demands for substantial pay and benefits increases risk damaging the U.S. auto industry, hurting its ability to compete against nonunion foreign rivals, the executive chairman of Ford Motor said on Monday.
The fight should not be seen as the U.A.W. against Ford, or its crosstown rivals, General Motors and Stellantis, said William C. Ford Jr., the great-grandson of the company's founder Henry Ford, noting that at times U.A.W. officials have referred to the automakers as the union's "enemy."
"It should be Ford and the U.A.W. against Toyota, Honda, Tesla and all the Chinese companies that want to enter our home market," Mr. Ford said at the company's Rouge plant in Dearborn, Mich.
"Toyota, Honda, Tesla and the others are loving the strike, because they know the longer it goes on, the better it is for them," the executive chairman said. "They will win, and all of us will lose."
Mr. Ford's remarks alluded to a period several decades ago when the U.A.W. won increasingly rich contracts that were later seen by many industry experts as having hobbled the three Michigan automakers in the face of competition from Japanese and European carmakers. Ford came to the brink of collapse, and G.M. and Chrysler -- now part of Stellantis -- had to seek bankruptcy protection after the 2008 financial crisis.
"Ford's ability to invest in the future isn't just a talking point," Mr. Ford said. "It is the absolute lifeblood of our company. And if we lose it, we will lose to the competition. Many jobs will be lost."
In a statement, the U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, said Mr. Ford should "stop playing games" and meet the union's demands, or "we'll close the Rouge for him." Mr. Fain added that the U.A.W. was not fighting the company but "corporate greed."
"If Ford wants to be the all-American auto company, they can pay all-American wages and benefits," Mr. Fain said. "Workers at Tesla, Toyota, Honda and others are not the enemy -- they're the U.A.W. members of the future."
Ford, G.M. and Stellantis have been negotiating new labor contracts with the U.A.W. since July. Over the past month, the union has called on workers at a few plants to go on strike. The action has idled three Ford plants, two G.M. factories and one Stellantis plant. Workers at 38 G.M. and Stellantis spare-parts warehouses are also on strike.
The strategy is intended to increase pressure on the companies to meet the union's demands for significantly higher wages, shorter working hours and expanded pensions, and to end a system that pays new hires just over half of the top U.A.W. wage of $ 32 an hour.
The companies have offered wage increases of more than 20 percent over the next four years and certain other measures in line with the union's demands, but the U.A.W. is pressing for greater concessions.
Last week, the union called for a strike by 8,700 workers at Ford's Kentucky truck plant in Louisville, the company's largest.
Ford executives said last week that the company had made a record offer to the union and that sweetening the deal would hurt the automaker's ability to invest in electric vehicles and other new models and technologies.
Mr. Ford, who has had a role in every round of negotiations with the U.A.W. since 1982, said the talks had reached "a crossroads" and warned that labor contracts that burdened the automakers with heavy costs could affect the U.S. economy.
"The price of failure should be clear to everyone," he said. "Let's come together and reach an agreement, so we can take the fight to the real competition."

Deal With China Leaves Nepal On the Hook for a Pricey Airport: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On a sweltering June morning, the new international terminal at the airport in Pokhara, Nepal's second-biggest city, roared to life with the arrival of a Sichuan Airlines flight from China.
A water cannon showered the plane, an Airbus A319, the first international flight to land at the airport since it had opened six months earlier. A throng of people gathered in the arrival area to greet the passengers, wishing them a "hearty welcome" to "the Land of Everest" with their signs.
These maiden arrivals were athletes and Chinese officials who had come for a good-will dragon boat race. Their flight had been chartered and funded by Beijing. Like almost every other facet of the airport, even the first batch of international passengers had relied on China's favor.
The celebration masked an unsettling reality: The expensive airport, built largely by Chinese companies and financed by Beijing, was a diplomatic victory for China and a windfall for its state-owned firms. For Nepal, it was already an economic albatross, saddling the country with debt to Chinese creditors for years to come.
Nepal had sought to build an international airport in Pokhara since the late 1970s, hoping that it would catapult the city into a global tourist destination. But the project had stalled for decades, mired in political turmoil, bureaucracy and money problems, until China stepped in.
The airport was part of China's ambitions to establish its own sphere of influence as an alternative to American hegemony. To China, few developing nations offered the geopolitical allure of Nepal, its neighbor to the south with close ties to India, an emerging rival for regional dominance.
After the airport's construction, Beijing began declaring that it had been part of the Belt and Road Initiative, President Xi Jinping's signature infrastructure campaign, which has doled out an estimated $ 1 trillion in loans and grants around the world. This designation, which Nepal has quietly rejected, has thrust the airport into the middle of a diplomatic tug of war between China and India.
As dozens of countries, including Nepal, gather in Beijing this week for the 10th anniversary of the initiative, China's overseas development projects are facing criticism for costly and poor-quality construction that leaves borrower nations awash in debt. The Pokhara airport highlights the pitfalls for countries that import China's infrastructure-at-any-cost development model, which spins off money for Chinese firms, often at the expense of the developing country.
In Nepal, China CAMC Engineering, the construction arm of a state-owned conglomerate, Sinomach, imported building materials and earth-moving machinery from China. The airport, built to a Chinese design, is packed with security and industrial technology made in China. Chen Song, China's ambassador to Nepal, said it "embodied the quality of Chinese engineering."
But an investigation by The New York Times, based on interviews with six people involved in the airport's construction and an examination of thousands of pages of documents, found that China CAMC Engineering had repeatedly dictated business terms to maximize profits and protect its interests, while dismantling Nepali oversight of its work.
This has left Nepal on the hook for an international airport, at a significantly inflated price, without the necessary passengers to repay loans to its Chinese lender.
Signing Off on a 20-Year Loan
Set in the foothills of the Himalayas, Pokhara is a picturesque destination for tourists drawn to Nepal's natural beauty. On a clear day, three of the world's 10 tallest mountains are visible from the city, making it a hub for trekkers in the Annapurna mountains.
In 2011, a year before China officially agreed to lend the money for the airport, Nepal's finance minister signed a memorandum of understanding to support CAMC's proposal, before any bidding process had even started.
The Chinese loan agreement allowed only Chinese firms to bid on the work. CAMC's winning bid of $ 305 million, almost twice what Nepal had estimated the airport would cost, raised the ire of some Nepali politicians, who called the price outrageous and the bidding process rigged. CAMC then lowered the price about 30 percent, to $ 216 million.
China and Nepal signed a 20-year agreement in 2016; a quarter of the money would be an interest-free loan. Nepal would borrow the rest from the Export-Import Bank of China, a state-owned lender that finances Beijing's overseas development work, at 2 percent interest. Nepal agreed to start repaying the loans in 2026.
Construction started a year after the loan deal.
In 2018, Murari Gautam was one of the first engineers and outside consultants brought on to help the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal oversee the Chinese contractor. He had worked abroad for much of the preceding decade in Saudi Arabia and in Qatar, where he served as an engineer building the soccer stadiums for the 2022 World Cup.
Mr. Gautam, an outgoing man with an easygoing personality, said being hired for the airport had been special because it was a big project for his home country and it was in the city where he had gone to high school.
Upon starting work, he immediately noticed red flags. Nepal's aviation agency was supposed to have teams of domestic and international experts as consultants, critical for a project of this magnitude, he said. But key roles were vacant, and the positions that were filled relied on recent college graduates with almost no experience.
The initial construction budget had earmarked $ 2.8 million for Nepal to hire consultants to make sure CAMC was abiding by international construction standards, according to documents. As the project went on, the Chinese firm and Nepal lowered that allocation to $ 10,000, using the money elsewhere.
Mr. Gautam said that CAMC had started work before any consultants were in place, and that the work CAMC had done did not meet international standards. CAMC completed earth-filling work for the 8,200-foot runway, but it had no documentation that it had tested the soil density. Mr. Gautam said no one on the Nepal side "knew how the foundation of the runway was built." Without proper soil density, the runway could become bumpy or littered with cracks and potholes in the future.
There were other problems, he said. CAMC designed the airport drainage system without taking into account historical rainfall data in locations across Pokhara and the sloping topography near the site, forgoing a standard practice in international construction. Without such considerations, Mr. Gautam said, the airport was at risk of flooding during heavy rains. There was also no paperwork ensuring the quality of Chinese-made building materials or information on the Chinese vendors providing the components, he said, contrary to the stipulations in CAMC's contract with Nepal.
Mr. Gautam said he had pressed CAMC for additional information or documentation. But CAMC sidestepped the consultants to deal directly with aviation agency officials, who were reluctant to push back and had little construction experience, he said. In November 2018, CAMC sent a curt letter to the Nepali agency with a warning that the project would be delayed because of "unnecessary revisions" from Nepal's consultants.
That month, Mr. Gautum resigned in frustration after a year on the job. He said that in his experience, it was not unusual for contractors to try to cut corners to maximize profits, but that he was stunned because there had been "no oversight at all" from Nepal. As a result, he said, the contractor was able to inflate the cost of the project -- to double the market rate, by his estimate -- and "quality had been compromised."
Krishna Paudel, an engineer at the aviation authority, said that the agency had maintained a "satisfactory" working relationship with CAMC and that its staff, as well as outside consultants, had provided oversight. He said there had been occasional misunderstandings over language and design standards, and acknowledged that CAMC "never budges from its stance."
CAMC squeezed more money from the project while eliminating oversight. China's Export-Import Bank, which had provided the loan, had appointed China IPPR International Engineering, a consulting firm, to track the quality, safety and timetable of the construction while ensuring that Nepali officials were satisfied with CAMC's work.
The consulting firm and the construction company are subsidiaries of Sinomach, a machinery giant ranked in the Fortune Global 500. The potential for conflicts of interest became even more pronounced in 2019 when CAMC acquired IPPR, turning it from a sister company into a direct subsidiary. The fees to pay IPPR came from Nepal, as part of its loan from the Chinese bank.
Jacky Zhao, who was IPPR's deputy team leader on the project, said his bosses in China had told him not to scrutinize CAMC's work too closely.
"We were told that our job was only to make sure that the project produced an airport and not a chicken farm," he said. The words for airport and chicken farm sound similar in Mandarin.
Mr. Zhao said IPPR had falsified documents to the Chinese bank about the résumés of its workers in Pokhara. Wang Hui, Mr. Zhao's wife, who was also employed by IPPR as an accountant, said someone had fabricated her credentials using fake certificates. A copy of her college diploma was altered to show that she had majored in financial management, but she had actually majored in Chinese language and literature.
In August 2022, IPPR dismissed Mr. Zhao and Ms. Wang for failing to follow instructions to return to China. They said the company had retaliated after they filed complaints about $ 11,000 in unpaid expenses.
CAMC and IPPR did not respond to multiple emails and messages seeking comment about their work at the Pokhara airport.
A Fatal Crash Involving a 'Big Manager'
In late 2022, as the project neared completion, Zhu Zhanfeng, the contractor's project site manager, was feeling boastful. He said in an interview that Pokhara would have "the first modern airport in Nepal" that adhered to the "Chinese standard."
There was no mention of the fact that three years earlier, Mr. Zhu had struck and killed a pedestrian in Pokhara after a night of drinking. According to a police report, an officer at the scene suspected that Mr. Zhu was drunk when he struck Deu Kumar Tamang, who was walking in a crosswalk around 11 p.m. on July 2, 2019, with his Toyota Hilux, a pickup truck. Mr. Tamang died on impact from "blunt force injury to the abdomen," according to the autopsy.
Shortly after the crash, CAMC approached Mr. Tamang's family to offer 1 million Nepali rupees, or about $ 7,500, as compensation, according to the victim's brother, Nabin Tamang. When the family refused, a CAMC employee told his family that Mr. Tamang was "already dead" and that "you might as well settle," Nabin Tamang said.
Then, CAMC offered to double the payment and grant the family space to open a coffee shop inside the new airport. The family, who live in a shack in a rural mountain village, accepted the offer. CAMC said it would pay only after Mr. Zhu was released from prison.
"Killing someone is a serious crime," Nabin Tamang said. "They treated this like a minor business transaction."
When the case went to trial, Mr. Zhu's lawyers argued that Mr. Tamang had been drinking and that he "himself came to hit the car and the car didn't hit the deceased," according to court filings. His lawyers added that Mr. Tamang's family had "already received last rites expenses." Mr. Zhu said that he had consumed one beer earlier in the night and had been driving carefully when he struck Mr. Tamang.
Mr. Zhu was found guilty of committing a "traffic death" and sentenced to four months in prison -- less than the maximum one-year sentence for that offense. He made bail after serving 50 days. He avoided the more serious charge of vehicular manslaughter, which carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years.
When contacted by The Times, Mr. Zhu said it was "inconvenient" for him to discuss the incident and asked that all further inquiries be directed to the Chinese Embassy in Nepal, which did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Mr. Zhu appealed the four-month sentence to Pokhara's High Court, which ruled in his favor and determined that neither alcohol nor careless driving had played a role in the death. In February 2021, it reduced Mr. Zhu's sentence to time already served.
Nabin Tamang said CAMC and Nepali authorities had received the outcome he believed they wanted: no interruptions in airport construction.
"The driver is a big manager who handled most of the airport work, and they wanted him released quickly," he said. CAMC stopped answering his phone calls asking about the coffee shop once Mr. Zhu was released.
A 'New Chapter' and a Quiet Airport
On Jan. 1, 2023, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Nepal's prime minister, officially opened the airport. The local headlines that day, however, were about a tweet from the Chinese Embassy in Nepal declaring Pokhara airport "the flagship project" of China and Nepal's Belt and Road Initiative cooperation, even though work on the airport predated China's infrastructure program.
In June, Chen Song, the Chinese ambassador to Nepal, called the airport a "new chapter" of Belt and Road cooperation. The Kathmandu Post, a leading English-language newspaper in Nepal, responded with a headline: "China envoy again packs a geopolitical punch as new Pokhara airport suffers."
Mr. Chen later told The Times that China would "not force the name" on Nepal, "but we will go with our own plans."
For Nepal, the airport's association with Belt and Road is fraught because India has looked askance at the Chinese initiative -- a problem for an airport struggling to attract international flights. So far, no Indian airlines plan to serve Pokhara.
Buddha Air, Nepal's biggest airline, said it had proposed a twice-weekly flight from Pokhara to Varanasi, a city in northern India, before adding flights to Dehradun and Delhi, but the Indian government has yet to grant those requests.
A 2014 feasibility study commissioned by CAMC projected that the airport would be able to repay loans from its profits. That forecast, however, was based on an estimated 280,000 international passengers traveling through the airport starting in 2025. As of now, there are no international flights.
With the airport struggling to generate the income necessary to pay off its loans, Nepali government officials requested that China turn the loan into a grant, according to local media reports. When Mr. Dahal visited Beijing in late September, the two countries issued a statement expressing "satisfaction" over the completion and operation of the Pokhara airport. China agreed to open more flights and routes to Nepal, including Pokhara.
The statement, however, did not mention any plans to waive the Pokhara airport loan.

There were other problems, he said. CAMC designed the airport drainage system without taking into account historical rainfall data in locations across Pokhara and the sloping topography near the site, forgoing a standard practice in international construction.
Without such considerations, Gautam said, the airport was at risk of flooding during heavy rains. There was also no paperwork ensuring the quality of Chinese-made building materials or information on the Chinese vendors providing the components, he said, contrary to the stipulations in CAMC’s contract with Nepal.
Gautam said he had pressed CAMC for additional information or documentation. But CAMC sidestepped the consultants to deal directly with aviation agency officials, who were reluctant to push back and had little construction experience, he said. In November 2018, CAMC sent a curt letter to the Nepali agency with a warning that the project would be delayed because of “unnecessary revisions” from Nepal’s consultants.
That month, Gautum resigned in frustration after a year on the job. He said that in his experience, it was not unusual for contractors to try to cut corners to maximize profits, but that he was stunned because there had been “no oversight at all” from Nepal. As a result, he said, the contractor was able to inflate the cost of the project — to double the market rate, by his estimate — and “quality had been compromised.”
Krishna Paudel, an engineer at the aviation authority, said that the agency had maintained a “satisfactory” working relationship with CAMC and that its staff, as well as outside consultants, had provided oversight. He said there had been occasional misunderstandings over language and design standards, and acknowledged that CAMC “never budges from its stance.”
CAMC squeezed more money from the project while eliminating oversight. China’s Export-Import Bank, which had provided the loan, had appointed China IPPR International Engineering, a consulting firm, to track the quality, safety and timetable of the construction while ensuring that Nepali officials were satisfied with CAMC’s work.
The consulting firm and the construction company are subsidiaries of Sinomach, a machinery giant ranked in the Fortune Global 500. The potential for conflicts of interest became even more pronounced in 2019 when CAMC acquired IPPR, turning it from a sister company into a direct subsidiary. The fees to pay IPPR came from Nepal, as part of its loan from the Chinese bank.
Jacky Zhao, who was IPPR’s deputy team leader on the project, said his bosses in China had told him not to scrutinize CAMC’s work too closely.
“We were told that our job was only to make sure that the project produced an airport and not a chicken farm,” he said. The words for airport and chicken farm sound similar in Mandarin.
Zhao said IPPR had falsified documents to the Chinese bank about the resumes of its workers in Pokhara. Wang Hui, Zhao’s wife, who was also employed by IPPR as an accountant, said someone had fabricated her credentials using fake certificates. A copy of her college diploma was altered to show that she had majored in financial management, but she had actually majored in Chinese language and literature.
In August 2022, IPPR dismissed Zhao and Wang for failing to follow instructions to return to China. They said the company had retaliated after they filed complaints about $11,000 in unpaid expenses.
CAMC and IPPR did not respond to multiple emails and messages seeking comment about their work at the Pokhara airport.
A Fatal Crash and a ‘Big Manager’
In late 2022, as the project neared completion, Zhu Zhanfeng, the contractor’s project site manager, was feeling boastful. He said in an interview that Pokhara would have “the first modern airport in Nepal” that adhered to the “Chinese standard.”
There was no mention of the fact that three years earlier, Zhu had struck and killed a pedestrian in Pokhara after a night of drinking. According to a police report, an officer at the scene suspected that Zhu was drunk when he struck Deu Kumar Tamang, who was walking in a crosswalk around 11 p.m. on July 2, 2019, with his Toyota Hilux, a pickup truck. Tamang died on impact from “blunt force injury to the abdomen,” according to the autopsy.
Shortly after the crash, CAMC approached Tamang’s family to offer 1 million Nepali rupees (about $7,500) as compensation, according to the victim’s brother, Nabin. When the family refused, a CAMC employee told his family that Tamang was “already dead” and that “you might as well settle,” Nabin said.
Then, CAMC offered to double the payment and grant the family space to open a coffee shop inside the new airport. The family, who live in a shack in a rural mountain village, accepted the offer. CAMC said it would pay only after Zhu was released from prison.
“Killing someone is a serious crime,” Nabin said. “They treated this like a minor business transaction.”
When the case went to trial, Zhu’s lawyers argued that Tamang had been drinking and that he “himself came to hit the car and the car didn’t hit the deceased,” according to court filings. His lawyers added that Tamang’s family had “already received last rites expenses.” Zhu said that he had consumed one beer earlier in the night and had been driving carefully when he struck Tamang.
Zhu was found guilty of committing a “traffic death” and sentenced to four months in prison — less than the maximum one-year sentence for that offense. He made bail after serving 50 days. He avoided the more serious charge of vehicular manslaughter, which carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years.
When contacted by the Times, Zhu said it was “inconvenient” for him to discuss the incident and asked that all further inquiries be directed to the Chinese Embassy in Nepal, which did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Zhu appealed the four-month sentence to Pokhara’s High Court, which ruled in his favor and determined that neither alcohol nor careless driving had played a role in the death. In February 2021, it reduced Zhu’s sentence to time already served.
Nabin Tamang said CAMC and Nepali authorities had received the outcome he believed they wanted: no interruptions in airport construction.
“The driver is a big manager who handled most of the airport work, and they wanted him released quickly,” he said. CAMC stopped answering his phone calls asking about the coffee shop once Zhu was released.
Struggling to Generate Income
On Jan. 1, 2023, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Nepal’s prime minister, officially opened the airport. The local headlines that day, however, were about a tweet from the Chinese Embassy in Nepal declaring Pokhara airport “the flagship project” of China and Nepal’s Belt and Road Initiative cooperation, even though work on the airport predated China’s infrastructure program.
In June, Chen Song, the Chinese ambassador to Nepal, called the airport a “new chapter” of Belt and Road cooperation. The Kathmandu Post, a leading English-language newspaper in Nepal, responded with a headline: “China envoy again packs a geopolitical punch as new Pokhara airport suffers.”
Chen later told the Times that China would “not force the name” on Nepal, “but we will go with our own plans.”
For Nepal, the airport’s association with Belt and Road is fraught because India has looked askance at the Chinese initiative — a problem for an airport struggling to attract international flights. So far, no Indian airlines plan to serve Pokhara.
Buddha Air, Nepal’s biggest airline, said it had proposed a twice-weekly flight from Pokhara to Varanasi, a city in northern India, before adding flights to Dehradun and Delhi, but the Indian government has yet to grant those requests.
A 2014 feasibility study commissioned by CAMC projected that the airport would be able to repay loans from its profits. That forecast, however, was based on an estimated 280,000 international passengers traveling through the airport starting in 2025. As of now, there are no international flights.
With the airport struggling to generate the income necessary to pay off its loans, Nepali government officials requested that China turn the loan into a grant, according to local media reports. When Dahal visited Beijing in late September, the two countries issued a statement expressing “satisfaction” over the completion and operation of the Pokhara airport. China agreed to open more flights and routes to Nepal, including Pokhara.
The statement, however, did not mention any plans to waive the Pokhara airport loan.

The Costs of Car Ownership Are Straining Finances: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For millions of Americans, cars are a necessity -- to get to work, to carry children around, to buy food. In recent memory, they've also never been as expensive to own.
According to AAA, the average annual cost in the first five years of new-car ownership rose to $ 12,182 this year, from $ 10,728 last year, reflecting increased purchase prices, maintenance costs and finance charges. That's 16 percent of the median household income, before taxes. (The figure includes depreciation.)
What does that look like in the aggregate? About 92 percent of households have at least one car available to them, and 22 percent have at least three. That comes out to about 223 million personal vehicles, and trillions of dollars a year in spending. By contrast, only $ 79 billion was spent on public transportation in 2019 for both capital and operating expenses.
On a personal level, America's dependence on automobiles means hefty bills, the risk of dangerous crashes and stress. And now, even with strong wage growth and elevated savings in recent years, high sticker prices and escalating interest rates are starting to take a toll: The share of borrowers moving into delinquency jumped in late 2022 and early 2023. Personal vehicles often become workers' largest expense, on par with housing, child care and food.
To understand how car owners are coping, we asked five of them to lay out the expenses associated with their cars. They're a lot higher than people sometimes bargain for. For most, there is no alternative. Brent McCulley is a 33-year-old Realtor in Pompano Beach, Fla., whose family of four requires two cars, making the cost of transportation its largest expense.
Mr. McCulley had been getting along all right in Newark, with one Kia Soul among him, his wife and their young daughter. It was stressful, shuttling the toddler to day care and then getting to his office by 8 a.m., but they made it work with enough public transportation to handle in-between trips.
Florida was a different story. Mr. McCulley was born there and always wanted to return, so they moved to Pompano Beach in early 2022. By that time, after some car swaps, they were driving a 2022 Kia Forte, which he leased for $ 294 per month. They had a baby boy and fewer transit options, so they needed to go car shopping again.
"She could walk to Aldi and get groceries," Mr. McCulley said of his wife. "But beyond that, there's only so much you can do."
Mr. McCulley's credit score had taken a hit after he took on debt to finance the move. So he bought a 2019 Kia Sorento from Carvana at a 12 percent interest rate, which would have required paying $ 7,645 in interest over the course of the loan. A few months later, his credit had improved enough for him to refinance at a 6.6 percent rate, which left the monthly payments at $ 577.
That's only a little more than the average monthly payment for used cars, which reached $ 533 in the second quarter this year, according to TransUnion. The average payment for new cars is $ 741. Both are record highs.
Insurance on both of those cars in Florida comes to $ 459. Gas adds $ 200 or so, bringing the total to around $ 1,530 a month. That's about as much as their rent.
And there's maintenance. After spending five years with a 1992 Buick Century that would break down every other week, Mr. McCulley likes to pay more for new or late-model vehicles because they tend to have fewer issues. Still, the Sorento has required about $ 3,000 in maintenance over the past year -- the front brakes had to be replaced, then the back brakes, and then a flat tire.
Mr. McCulley expects this to be a lucrative year at work, with commissions that should amount to about double Pompano Beach's median household income. But with all their expenses -- including the resumption of mandatory student loan payments, and his son's day care -- they're budgeting carefully. His wife decided to take a job at a veterinarian's office to cover all the bills.
For Mr. McCulley, it's an illustration that even for people who look comfortably middle class, car expenses contribute to a feeling of being overwhelmed.
"Whether you're a millionaire trying to figure out how to allocate your taxes, or whether you're making minimum wage," Mr. McCulley said, "it's all struggle in different kinds of ways." Troy Massey is a 29-year-old Amazon driver in Jacksonville, Fla., who needs a car to go even a few miles but keeps getting underwater on car loans.
A few years ago, debts had piled up while Mr. Massey was attending the University of Central Florida; he lost his financial aid and had to drop out. Juggling too many bills, he fell behind on the loan for his 2013 Honda Civic. In the fall of 2021, it was repossessed -- but because he still owed $ 4,800, the loan balance, he had to keep making payments on a car he didn't own.
Mr. Massey spent most of 2022 without a vehicle. It was technically feasible; he lived only a few miles from where he worked, at Walmart. But the bus wasn't reliable, and when he tried to walk or bike, he'd end up soaked in sweat or a sudden downpour. After a while, he'd had enough.
"I just ended up biting the bullet and saying, 'I need to get another car,"' Mr. Massey said. "I know what happened to the last one, but it's a necessity. If we had some kind of rail system or something like that, it'd be fine. But we don't."
This time, though, getting a car was even more expensive. The cheapest reliable car he could find, a Toyota Corolla with 89,000 miles, cost $ 18,240 including taxes and fees. With a 15.2 percent interest rate and an extended warranty, that left him with monthly payments of $ 451. Looking for insurance, he couldn't find anything less than $ 323 a month for the most basic plan.
Soon after, he switched from Walmart to a Winn-Dixie and took a second job working part time at Amazon, a 35-minute drive from his apartment. Gas for those commutes cost about $ 40 per week, bringing the monthly total to nearly $ 1,000, along with occasional maintenance, like the $ 100 for his last oil change and $ 27 to fix a slowly leaking tire.
"For someone who's making a decent income, that might not be as hard," Mr. Massey said. "But for someone like me who's in the middle of trying to change careers making $ 15.50 an hour, it hits you like a truck."
Mr. Massey thought about selling his Corolla and trying to find something even cheaper. The problem is, he still owes about $ 16,000 on the car, and its book value is only about half that, so he'd have to pay off the difference -- again.
That's an increasingly common experience, as the average used-car loan at origination has reached 123 percent of the vehicle's market value, according to TransUnion. And although overall delinquency on auto loans is low, delinquencies have been climbing quickly since interest rates started increasing in 2022.
In August, he switched to a job driving full time for one of Amazon's delivery contractors making $ 18.75 an hour, which comes to about $ 3,000 a month before taxes. Rent for his apartment with roommates is $ 700, leaving little for food and the credit card bills he's still trying to pay off.
Mr. Massey is building his software programming portfolio so he can start applying for jobs that pay more -- at least enough to afford his car. Jennifer Owings is a 48-year-old school administrator in New York City whose two- to three-hour round-trip commute costs more than $ 1,000 a month.
Ms. Owings loves her job, as an assistant principal at a public elementary school in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She also loves her home on Staten Island, a condominium with a pool that she bought after a divorce a few years ago, and the community she has developed there.
She does not, however, love the commute -- or how much it costs.
She gets in her 2017 Subaru Outback, which she's paying off in $ 328 installments, and leaves at 5:10 a.m., when the 13 miles over the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and down the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway are mostly clear (but include tolls totaling $ 175 a month). The afternoon commute is tricky; if she waits too long, it can take two hours. "Any Friday in June, forget about it," Ms. Owings said.
Some expenses are occasional, like maintenance, which Ms. Owings estimates at $ 50 a month on average. So far insurance has covered major damage, like the crash in 2021 that put the car in the shop for weeks, but it costs $ 232 a month. Even minor needs add up, like registration this year, which was $ 138. She's also enrolled in a monthly unlimited carwash plan, which costs $ 23.95.
Parking is the only thing that's free, and some older staff members at her school even drive from Long Island. "I'd say the under-30 crew probably doesn't have their own cars because they can't afford to -- it's too expensive," Ms. Owings said.
She could take a pay cut and return to teaching in a school closer to her house on Staten Island, and save some of the $ 200 a month she spends on gas. But a good boss, leadership opportunities and a school she likes are hard to give up. And public transportation?
"It would actually be faster to take my own kayak -- or to run," said Ms. Owings, who competes in marathons. Instead, as much as she enjoys having the time to catch up with friends, spending continuous hours in a car every day has given her hip pain. "Other people have old sports injuries," she said. "I have a commuting injury." Aydee Joya is a 56-year-old Uber driver living in Arlington, Va., who barely breaks even after accounting for all her expenses.
Technically, Ms. Joya's car is her job, but sometimes it feels as if she's working just to pay for it.
Ms. Joya immigrated from El Salvador as a child and worked for 26 years as a bilingual family assistant in public schools. When her job was eliminated in 2018, a friend told her that driving for taxi apps was a good way to make money on her own schedule, so she started driving for Uber in her 2014 Nissan Rogue.
It worked out all right for a while, and she enjoyed driving. But Ms. Joya quickly learned how many costs are involved in ferrying people around, along with the $ 235 she spends in gas per week.
First came a spent battery, followed by oil changes, tires punctured by potholes, seats soiled by passengers' vomit. In July and August, routine maintenance, including a tire alignment and transmission flush, came to $ 1,433.
"There are things that people don't know that are involved with their car," Ms. Joya said. "We use the brakes all the time. You need to do a lot of repairs, not only tires, not only oil change. All the things inside the car get damaged."
As many ride-hailing drivers do for their protection, she installed a camera in the car at her expense. County property taxes on her vehicle come to $ 566 per year, tolls add about $ 32 a month, and she faces occasional speeding tickets.
Insurance costs $ 603 for six months. In 2022, despite often driving 12 hours a day, she said she made only $ 12,000 after expenses.
In early 2023, as she drove to pick up a passenger, her car was rear-ended. The Nissan was totaled, and Ms. Joya was left with slicing back pain that has made it difficult to drive for long stretches.
Now she drives a 2020 Honda HR-V with a monthly loan payment of $ 536. To make matters worse, she said, Uber isn't paying as much on her fares as it used to. (Uber said drivers' average earnings per hour that they were engaged with a passenger -- that is, not counting time between fares -- had risen since 2019.)
"I'm spending my own money for Uber," while the company makes the profit, Ms. Joya said.
Ms. Joya has thought about moving on from Uber, and at the urging of her husband -- a retired construction worker who worries about her being out late, with several high-profile reports of violence toward ride-hailing drivers recently -- earned a certificate to become a clinical medical assistant. But she hasn't found a job yet, so she keeps driving. Cyndy Knighton is a 58-year-old transportation engineer for the City of Tukwila, Wash., who suffered several car accidents over the past year and a half.
Transportation didn't cost that much for Ms. Knighton, who drove a paid-off 2009 Nissan Altima hybrid -- until April 2022, when a teenager driving on a learner's permit made a left turn in front of her. She broke a wrist and her sternum in the collision, and the car was totaled.
An insurance payout covered the cost of a 14-year-old Subaru and immediately needed repairs, but the vehicle switch subjected her to spiking gasoline prices that she had mostly avoided with her hybrid; the new car required about $ 163 per month to fuel.
In search of a longer-term solution, Ms. Knighton decided to order a new hybrid Toyota Highlander that could handle her steep driveway even during the rare snow and transport her four Samoyeds, which she breeds and occasionally enters in dog shows.
That car, however, got snarled in pandemic supply chain issues. The 2022 edition was converted into a 2023, with a slightly higher base price. Then in March, Ms. Knighton was hit again -- her Subaru was rear-ended on Interstate 5 heading into Seattle, resulting in a concussion and another wrecked vehicle.
This time, with used cars in short supply, she paid about $ 8,200 -- more than the $ 6,200 insurance payout -- to buy a 2001 Highlander with poor gas mileage. To add additional insurance protection, she's now paying $ 158 a month in premiums.
Treatment for her injuries has racked up more than $ 86,000 in medical bills, which her employer's health insurance has covered, other than her $ 750 in co-payments. In September, after more than a year of wrangling with her car insurance company, she finally heard she would receive insurance payouts worth $ 80,000 after lawyers' fees.
That will be enough to buy the new Highlander outright, at $ 62,350 including taxes. But Ms. Knighton would never have chosen to finance a new car that way. Aside from the pain and continuing physical therapy, the psychic trauma of repeated accidents takes its own toll. Small shocks on the road -- like when she had to slam on the brakes recently, sending one of her dogs into the windshield -- can bring on tears.
"I get the irony, that I'm a transportation professional and I'm afraid to drive," Ms. Knighton said. "To have that lurking there, that could break through at any random time for any reason, is debilitating. It's an emotional, intellectual cost that is intangible."

Why Electric Vehicles Are a Favorite Scapegoat for Republican Candidates: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The industry's transition to battery power is already underway. Republican presidential candidates are pushing to reverse course.
Fresh off a walking tour of blighted Flint, Mich., on Wednesday, Vivek Ramaswamy spoke excitedly about a comeback for the "forgotten America" that he has made a part of his long-shot bid for the presidency.
He wasn't promising that the automakers that had largely abandoned Flint would return. "We have opportunities, though, to look to the future of a lot that we need to bring to this country," Mr. Ramaswamy, a 38-year-old entrepreneur, said, ticking through the industries that he'd like to see help drive a revival: semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, defense production.
The industry he doesn't want involved is the one already pouring money into the state: electric vehicles. He attributes the investments and the rising popularity of the cars to tax credits and favorable regulations that he would reverse as president.
"That's not only a market distortion, but a market distortion that is decidedly a step in an anti-American direction that I think is frankly dangerous to the future of the country," he told reporters just outside Flint.
Mr. Ramaswamy's enmity toward electric cars, extolled in the ancestral home of the American automobile, does not exactly set him apart in the presidential field. The front-runner for the Republican nomination, Donald J. Trump, was in Michigan last week, reeling off a rambling bill of particulars against E.V.s, complaining falsely that they run out of power in 15 minutes, are bad for the environment, and would destroy the domestic auto industry within a few short years.
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a distant second to Mr. Trump in national polls, recently railed against electric vehicles when he unveiled an energy policy platform that promised to roll back E.V. subsidies to "support Americans' right to drive the cars they want." Mike Pence, Mr. Trump's former vice president-turned-competitor, agrees with Mr. Ramaswamy and others that the transition to electric vehicles would send American auto manufacturing to China.
Opposing electric cars -- and the industry's ongoing shift away from internal-combustion engines to battery power -- allows Republican candidates to criticize China, the dominant economic force in the battery industry. It also pleases G.O.P. voters still hostile to the notion of climate change -- what Mr. Ramaswamy disparaged Wednesday night as "that God-forsaken religion, the climate cult" and "the E.V. subsidy cult" -- and to all things environmental and "woke." And it evokes a nostalgic halcyon past, the same one that Mr. Trump conjured when he promised in 2016 to bring back coal mines, steel mills and basic manufacturing.
But the steel mills and coal mines failed to roar back to their glory days, and the internal-combustion engine is unlikely to as well. In fact, the electric vehicle transition is well underway.
That transition is driven in part by President Biden's policies, which subsidize the manufacturing and purchasing of E.V.s and their components and impose strict fuel economy standards on automakers that can be met with zero-emission electric cars. But it's also motivated by Detroit executives who have vowed to convert their corporations to all electric, by consumers reacting to environmental concerns and gas prices, and by aggressive policies from governments like those of California, Britain and Europe that are beyond the reach of a Republican White House.
Those forces have prompted hundreds of billions of dollars to pour into states like Michigan and Ohio, but also to Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama and Tennessee, to assemble electric vehicles and build batteries and other parts with the warm embrace of Republican governors.
"The free market and consumer demand should drive the automobile manufacturing industry like it has here in Georgia, creating thousands of high-paying E.V. jobs across our state because of Georgia's first-class business environment, unmatched work force and strong logistics network," Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, said in a statement this week. "The path to America leading industrial innovation in the 21st century is through Republican-led states."
But Republican presidential candidates say that, if elected, they will eliminate Mr. Biden's tax incentives to build and buy electric cars and trucks, and roll back his fuel efficiency standards aimed at sharply reducing climate-warming greenhouse gases.
"I support letting people choose the cars that they want without those perverse incentives and the tax code that suggests that buying an electric vehicle is somehow in the owner's best interest," Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina said, though such incentives have helped prompt BMW, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz to expand E.V. operations in his state.
The Republican Party's attacks on E.V.s. stem in part from real concerns shared by the auto industry and foreign policymakers. China does dominate battery-making, and as lithium-ion battery imports soar -- they were up 99 percent last year from 2021 -- a weakening Chinese domestic economy is bolstered abroad.
In Green Charter Township, Mich., where Gotion, a Chinese subsidiary, plans to build a battery plant, Mr. Ramaswamy showed up Wednesday evening at a horse farm dotted with signs reading "No Go on Gotion." Alongside promises to "make sure that God-forsaken plant never gets built," he criticized the "electric vehicle subsidy cult," which, he said to cheers, "will end on my watch as your next president."
"If you want to buy an E.V., I'm fine with that -- we don't need to use our taxpayer dollars to subsidize it," Mr. Ramaswamy said, declaring that subsidies involve "subsidizing the C.C.P. because those E.V.s require batteries made in China -- now made by China across the street from here," a reference to the Chinese Communist Party.
And some attendees agreed.
"I don't have a problem with electric vehicles -- if you want one, OK, cool, buy one. But don't force me, because I got a Dodge Ram with a Hemi and I love it," Randy Guppy, from Howard City, Mich., said, referring to a type of V-8 engine.
John Bozzella, president of the auto industry's Alliance for Automotive Innovation, also fretted that the Biden administration's aggressive push for electrification was driving the auto industry faster than suppliers could ramp up battery production, strengthening China's hand -- and possibly opening the domestic market to cheap Chinese electric cars.
And electric vehicles do take fewer workers to assemble than internal-combustion vehicles, driving labor unrest and Democratic political worries.
But the notion that electric vehicles are economically out of reach, technically infeasible and will somehow cripple domestic auto production and shift manufacturing to China appears belied by what is actually happening. This spring, fully electric vehicle sales reached 7.2 percent of all car and light-truck sales, a 48.4 percent increase over the year before and on a trajectory that analysts believe will only accelerate, according to Cox Automotive. U.S. consumers chose from 103 different models of cars, pickup trucks, S.U.V.s and vans.
The automotive industry said the average cost of an E.V. fell this year by $ 10,700, to $ 54,300 -- $ 5,800 more than the overall average cost of cars and light trucks in the country.
Some 77 percent of all E.V.s sold in the United States were produced in North America -- almost 60 percent from Tesla, owned by Republican-friendly Elon Musk. The rest were from Japan, Europe and South Korea. More than 660,000 electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids were sold in the United States in the first half of this year, by the industry's count; only a few thousand were from China, and that number actually declined, according to automotive analysts.
Money is pouring in. Around $ 115 billion has been pledged to build vehicles, batteries and components in the United States, much of that in Michigan and the Southeast. Georgia, a key swing state in 2024, has seen $ 25.1 billion in pledged investment alone, said Garrison Douglas, a spokesman for Governor Kemp.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment in the industry will rise by more than 8.3 million by 2031, and while employment for basic assembly-line workers will decline by 96,000, higher wage jobs in engineering, software development and electronic assembly will shoot upward.
Earlier this year, Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, a Republican, blocked Ford from considering his state for a new battery factory, saying he was worried that the automaker was being used "as a front for China," which would have controlled much of the plant's technology. Ford then moved its $ 3.5 billion investment to Marshall, Mich.
Stacey LaRouche, a spokeswoman for Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan's Democratic governor, talked up such investment on Wednesday, as Toyota and LG Energy Systems were announcing a $ 3 billion expansion of LG's battery plant in Holland, Mich., to power Toyota E.V.s built in Kentucky.
Electric vehicle and battery deals, she said, "are creating thousands of good paying jobs right here in Michigan, not overseas."

Congressman Is Carjacked At Gunpoint Near Capitol: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The police recovered Representative Henry Cuellar's vehicle after he was carjacked in the Navy Yard neighborhood. He was unharmed.
Since the start of the year, hundreds of drivers across the nation's capital have been robbed of their vehicles at gunpoint. On Monday night, the latest victim was a member of Congress.
Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat representing a portion of South Texas, was carjacked in front of his Washington, D.C., apartment building, he said in an interview on Tuesday evening. He was not harmed and the police later recovered the vehicle, a Toyota crossover.
It was a little before 9:30 p.m. in the Navy Yard neighborhood -- an area of restaurants, bars and sports stadiums about a mile south of the Capitol -- when Mr. Cuellar returned with an order of sushi to an apartment complex where many members of Congress stay while in Washington.
As soon as he got out of the car, Mr. Cuellar said, he found himself surrounded by three men who ran toward him wearing ski masks. Two of them were pointing firearms at him. They all looked young, he said.
"You assess these things quickly," Mr. Cuellar said. "You stay calm. These are young people. You don't want to excite them. You make sure you don't aggravate anyone. I have a black belt, but you know what you can do and what you can't do."
He told them they could take the Toyota. They also took his iPad and iPhone, though Mr. Cuellar said the tracking device on the phone ultimately led the police to the car. It was found about two and a half miles away in the Barry Farm neighborhood.
The U.S. Capitol Police is leading the search for the suspects. "We have a number of leads," Chief J. Thomas Manger said in a statement.
Unlike many other cities, which have seen crime fall this year, violent crime has continued to rise in Washington, with the city on pace to record the most homicides in two decades. The increase in carjackings has been even more pronounced. After rising during the coronavirus pandemic, the number of carjackings exploded this year: There have been 753 across the city to date, according to the police, far surpassing the 485 recorded all of last year.
There have been dozens of carjackings in each of the city's seven police districts, and four of the districts have already recorded more than 100. In the Sixth District, which lies across the Anacostia River from the Navy Yard, there have been more than 200.
Many of the carjackings have been carried out by teenagers, and roughly two-thirds of those arrested for carjacking offenses this year have been under 18.
In a city of 700,000 that is also the seat of the federal government, the politics of responding to crime has long been complicated and often divisive.
Republicans in the current Congress have repeatedly pushed to intervene in the city's management of crime issues, drawing enough Democratic support for a successful effort in the spring to overrule the city's adoption of a new criminal code. In August, several Republicans, citing "violent crime, drugs, theft, homelessness and riots," introduced a bill that would strip the city of its home rule status, taking authority from an elected mayor and City Council and giving it to Congress.
Officials in D.C. counter that one of the challenges to fighting crime effectively is that the city -- heavily Democratic and roughly 45 percent Black -- has too little control over its own affairs, with most crimes prosecuted by the U.S. attorney's office, and local judges nominated by the White House and confirmed by the Senate.
Still, for many of those who live and work in Washington, the carjacking of a member of Congress is only further proof that the situation is acute.
"What Congressman Cuellar went through is what hundreds of residents are experiencing every day," said Trayon White, a councilman who represents a part of the city that has been plagued by gun violence. "We must handle increasing high crime with resources and urgency because it is an emergency."

In a Man's World, Feinstein Led The Way for Women in Office: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Dianne Feinstein was elected in 1992, only two women were in the U.S. Senate. There were 25 on the day she died.
Dianne Feinstein had several lifetimes' worth of accomplishments by the time she died on Thursday at 90. She was pivotal in crafting a decade-long bipartisan assault weapons ban. She helped lead the congressional response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and questioned the Central Intelligence Agency for its use of torture. As mayor of San Francisco, she led her hometown through years of tumult.
But for generations of women in California and beyond, her most lasting legacy was that she had accomplished it all in a world long dominated by men.
"She inspired women like me to leadership," said Eleni Kounalakis, 57, the lieutenant governor of California who is among the leading contenders for the state's top job in 2026. "Dianne broke marble ceilings for the rest of us."
Outwardly formal in her public life and inwardly armed with a fierce work ethic, Ms. Feinstein showed that it was acceptable not only for a woman to wield political power, but also to want it, and to keep working to win it, even after repeated setbacks.
She endured bare-knuckle politics in San Francisco, twice losing bids to become its first woman to serve as mayor until she took control of the city when Mayor George Moscone was killed at City Hall in a double assassination. Later, she lost her race to become California's first female governor but quickly pivoted to the Senate, where she and Barbara Boxer made history when they became the first two women to represent the state.
In 1991, the year before Ms. Feinstein was elected, only two women were serving in the 100-member Senate. On Thursday, when she cast her last vote, there were 25.
"Her remarkable life in politics was a message to other women about the possibilities of public life," said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.
The daughter of a well-known San Francisco physician, Ms. Feinstein started her political career with the help of one of her father's patients, Edmund G. Brown, known as Pat, who was the governor of California and whose son, Jerry Brown, would also go on to become governor.
A graduate of Stanford University, Ms. Feinstein had written a report on criminal justice as a prestigious Coro fellow, and Mr. Brown had appointed her to a $ 600-a-month post on the state parole board for women. It was a welcome opportunity: After a brief early marriage and divorce, she had a child to support.
In 1969, she parlayed her appointment into an upset victory in a race for the Board of Supervisors that governs the city. As the highest vote-getter, she became the first female board president as well. Over the next decade, she toiled in local government as societal upheaval rocked San Francisco and cancer claimed the lives of both her father and her second husband.
She was 45 and thinking about retiring from politics when, in 1978, shots exploded down the hall from her office and the double assassination of Mayor Moscone and a fellow supervisor, Harvey Milk, catapulted her into the political limelight as the first female mayor of San Francisco. Leading from the political center, she served for nearly another decade and was nationally known by 1990, when she ran for governor.
That year, Libby Schaaf was working a catering job and busing tables in the Bay Area after college, figuring out what course her life would take. She had been a political science major and a campaign volunteer -- and was particularly struck by this dynamic woman who led San Francisco and stood a real chance of becoming the first woman to serve as California governor.
At 24, Ms. Schaaf knew she had to find her way down to Los Angeles, where Democrats were convening to formally nominate their candidate for governor against Pete Wilson, the Republican senator. She was scraping by financially, but when a Bay Area delegate offered to give her his proxy vote, she hit the road.
"I was so inspired that I drove six hours to L.A. in a falling-apart Toyota and slept on somebody's floor," Ms. Schaaf, now 57, recalled. Decades later, after a career as a lawyer and a political aide, Ms. Schaaf won a seat on the Oakland City Council and, in 2015, became the second woman to serve as the city's mayor.
Though Ms. Feinstein lost that governor's race to Mr. Wilson, she turned around to win a special election to fill the Senate vacancy left by his departure from Congress. By then, a new furor consumed the nation over the confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court, during which Anita Hill told the male-dominated Senate Judiciary Committee that Judge Thomas had sexually harassed her when he was her supervisor.
Ms Feinstein and Ms. Boxer campaigned together, "almost as a slate" and often hand-in-hand, Ms. Boxer said, recalling Ms. Feinstein's generosity as a politician. Ms. Feinstein, who had already run statewide and was widely known for her moderate views and her courage in San Francisco, was far more popular in California than Ms. Boxer, a liberal congresswoman in a state that, in those days, tilted right in statewide races.
"She easily could have said, 'Barbara, good luck.' Instead, she said, 'Barbara, we're in this together,"' Ms. Boxer recalled.
In what would later be called "The Year of the Woman," Senator Feinstein was sworn in shortly after the election, two months ahead of Senator Boxer, and California became the first state with two female senators. Ms. Boxer retired from the Senate in 2017 and now lives in Palm Springs. Ms. Feinstein was the longest-serving senator in California history when she died at her Washington, D.C., home.
Over several decades, Ms. Feinstein's career would yield lessons for women who were interested in entering public office. If she did not overtly seek out the next generation of female candidates like Representative Nancy Pelosi, who served for decades as the Democratic Party's House leader and was the first woman to become speaker, many nonetheless benefited from her exacting mentorship.
"I overprepare for everything," said Alexis Podesta, who worked for Ms. Feinstein from 2002 to 2009. "I enjoy doing my own staff work. I make a point to listen and to be a champion of other women. The work ethic she instilled is something that I couldn't shake even if I wanted to."
The lessons Ms. Podesta learned from Ms. Feinstein served her well. She went on to become a cabinet member for two California governors, Jerry Brown and Gavin Newsom, heading the state's business, consumer services and housing agency.
Ms. Podesta recalled how, early in her tenure as the senator's scheduler, Ms. Feinstein returned from a Democratic caucus lunch and handed her a notecard with the first names and dress sizes of all the female senators (by then, about two decades ago, there were more than a dozen). The male senators, it turned out, had revived a warm-weather tradition known as "seersucker suit day," and Ms. Feinstein was determined not to let the male bonding go on without her and her fellow Senate women.
Ms. Podesta said that she was given only a couple of weeks to get every female senator outfitted, a fraught mission that, since the senator's death, many of Ms. Feinstein's colleagues have mentioned with affection.
"They remember it as sweet," she said, "but on the back end, it was 1,000 percent terrifying to ensure everyone got a suit."
Ms. Schaaf said she was in her first year as mayor of Oakland in 2015 by the time she met Senator Feinstein face-to-face for the first time. The senator, she said, invited her and the Alameda County district attorney, Nancy O'Malley, to lunch at a San Francisco restaurant.
The experience left her star-struck -- "like meeting Prince," Ms. Schaaf said -- but after that, Ms. Feinstein began including her in lunches that she would hold regularly for female officeholders in California.
"We'd have these hard and detailed policy conversations about issues and resource needs and so on, and then we'd kick our staffers out and have a glass of chilled white wine," Ms. Schaaf recalled. "Just one glass, but we'd have it."
It may come as a surprise that California, a state that has broken so many barriers, has never had a female governor. Forty-nine women in 32 other states have served as chief executive, according to Ms. Walsh's organization. But none in the nation's most populous state.
Ms. Kounalakis now stands as an early favorite to become California's first. Gov. Gavin Newsom cannot run again because the state limits its executive officeholders to two terms, which means a crowded field of ambitious candidates are planning to vie for the job in three years. The lieutenant governor said she learned valuable lessons from Ms. Feinstein, who championed her as a delegate to the California Democratic Party and as the U.S. ambassador to Hungary during the Obama administration.
"She expected you to work harder than anyone else," Ms. Kounalakis said. "And if you were going to be intimidated, you had no business putting yourself forward."

Strikes and Deep Roots: 'Good Stories in Detroit': [National Desk]

Full text: As electric vehicles usher in a new era for the car economy and workers strike against rooted manufacturers, Neal E. Boudette is in Motor City to cover it all.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
For the first time in the nearly 90-year history of the United Auto Workers, the union is on strike against all three of the large Detroit automakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler -- at the same time.
The targeted strike, which started on Sept. 15 and expanded last Friday, has shut down three auto plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri, and 38 parts distribution centers operated by G.M. and Stellantis. About 18,300 U.A.W. members are on strike while the union demands a 40 percent pay increase. The shutdowns affect only a few car models, but a protracted strike would affect consumers and the U.S. economy.
Neal E. Boudette, who covers the auto industry from Detroit for The New York Times, has been reporting on the negotiations between the union and automakers. He has covered the automobile industry since 2002, when he was in Germany working for The Wall Street Journal. He joined The Times in 2016.
In an interview, Mr. Boudette spoke about the evolution of the industry, its symbolism in the United States and what this strike could mean for other automakers. This interview has been edited and condensed.
President Biden visited a picket line in Michigan this week, which has been described as unprecedented for a sitting president. Does this strike feel different from U.A.W.'s strike at General Motors in 2019, or ones before that?
A lot of the strikes in the past 20 years have been symbolic more than strategic. This year, it's a totally different dynamic. The union has a very strong negotiating position. The car companies are making tons of money, and workers have not received raises that have kept up with inflation. The workers have a lot of support from the public.
There have been strikes in the past that were very contentious and even resulted in street clashes. But in the 21st century, there hasn't been a strike like this.
You worked in Germany before coming to Detroit. How do the settings compare?
Detroit is Motor City. The whole region has this very strong connection to automobiles. There's a century-long history and a great deal of culture built around the automobile. The Detroit Red Wings -- their logo is a winged wheel.
It was less so in Germany. I was based in Frankfurt, not an auto center. Opel was a little bit outside of Frankfurt, and Mercedes was south of Frankfurt. B.M.W. was down in Munich; Volkswagen was up north in Wolfsburg. Each of those towns is a little like Detroit, but you didn't have the concentration that you have in Detroit.
How has the evolution of electric vehicles changed your beat?
The biggest trend is electrification, and there are many different aspects of it. Aside from the fact that you have to get these cars designed and developed and produced, there's a social aspect to it. We need chargers all over the place, and charging a car is a different social experience than filling up your gas tank.
Then there's the climate aspect. The evolution of the industry to electronic vehicles has been called the biggest transition the industry has seen since the introduction of the moving assembly line.
The beat is multifaceted now. Before the financial crisis, it wasn't quite like that. There was a technology race, but it was a very limited technology race. And now it's taking on a much greater breadth.
What affects will the strike have on the industry?
Eventually the union and automakers will come up with an agreement. And then the next big question will be: How much of a burden does this contract put on these companies? Their competitors -- Toyota, Volkswagen, Honda, Kia -- are foreign companies who operate nonunion factories. Most of their workers make considerably less than the top U.A.W. wage.
In recent years, U.A.W. tried to organize a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee and a Nissan plant in Mississippi, and the workers voted down union representation. They didn't want to rock the boat.
But there's a lot of power on the side of workers these days. I think it's possible workers in the South say: We're making $ 22 an hour. The workers in Detroit are making $ 32 an hour. We should be in the union.
As an auto industry reporter, are you a big car guy?
It's funny, I'm not. I'm interested in cars, but I'm not a big car person. I drive a Chevy Malibu, believe it or not.
Cars are interesting products to cover. There's no other country in the world where there are as many pop songs and movies about cars. The Beach Boys' "409"; that David Hasselhoff TV show, "Knight Rider." It's a whole TV show built around a car.
There are good stories in Detroit. Sometimes it's a matter of explaining things to readers. We did a lot of that in the past year on the transition to E.V.s. There are also really interesting personalities to write about. That's what keeps me going.

Full text: Joby Aviation delivered the aircraft, which can carry a pilot and four passengers, to Edwards Air Force Base in California for testing.
The Air Force said on Monday that it had received its first electric passenger aircraft capable of taking off and landing vertically, a milestone for the companies that hope to one day sell thousands of such vehicles to serve as air taxis.
Joby Aviation, an air taxi start-up, delivered the aircraft to Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California, where the first supersonic flight took place. Air taxis are typically powered by batteries and designed to lift off and land like helicopters, but include wings to fly like airplanes.
Joby, which is based in Santa Cruz, Calif., said that its electric aircraft is substantially quieter than helicopters or planes. Each can carry one pilot and four passengers and travel as fast as 200 miles per hour and as far as 100 miles, according to the company.
The delivery is the first under an Air Force contract that Joby said was valued at up to $ 131 million and gives the government the option to receive up to nine aircraft. The Air Force and Joby will operate the vehicle, but Joby will still own the aircraft and receive both fixed and variable payments for hours flown. NASA, which has a facility at the base, will also conduct research on the vehicle.
The Air Force has signed similar contracts with other air taxi companies under a program called Agility Prime, part of a broader effort to promote innovation. Agility Prime's mission is to support development of air taxis and similar technology, giving the Air Force a head start in exploring how it might use such aircraft while also providing financial and testing support to the air taxi companies.
"It is incredibly valuable for us to be getting to do early operations and to build the operational muscle," Joby's chief executive, JoeBen Bevirt, said. The collaboration will help Joby in several ways, including in learning how best to train pilots and maintain and charge aircraft in real-world situations.
Joby and other air taxi companies, including Archer Aviation and Beta Technologies, are separately rushing to get the Federal Aviation Administration to certify their aircraft for commercial flight. All three companies hope to begin commercial service as soon as 2025. The F.A.A. has said it is preparing to support robust air taxi operations by 2028.
But because the agency does not govern aircraft used by the military, air taxi companies have eagerly pursued defense contracts while they work toward F.A.A. approval.
At Edwards Air Force Base, Joby's aircraft will be tested as a means to transport cargo and people. The vehicles could also be used to monitor the expansive base or tested to conduct medical evacuations, for example. All told, the Air Force has more than 100 performance measures it wants to evaluate, said Beau Griffith, the deputy lead of Agility Prime.
"Bearing out the promise of these vehicles is the program's goal," he said.
NASA will work closely with the military and Joby in testing the aircraft, with the aim of using its research to guide air taxi development and support the F.A.A. Starting next year, NASA pilots and researchers will explore how Joby's vehicle would operate in a typical city environment, examining flight procedures and how it could interact with air traffic control and local infrastructure. Joby's aircraft is expected to remain at the base for at least a year, and the company has plans to deliver another in 2024.
Other leading air taxi companies have similar partnerships. Archer, in Santa Clara, Calif., announced this summer that it had signed Air Force contracts valued at up to $ 142 million, which included delivery of up to six aircraft similar to Joby's. Beta, in Burlington, Vt., is the first electric air taxi manufacturer to receive an airworthiness certificate for manned flight from the military, with pilots from both the Air Force and the Army having flown its aircraft. That company is also installing the first electric aircraft charging station at a military installation.
In addition to support from the military, the air taxi industry has received substantial support from other aviation and automotive companies.
Joby's investors include Delta Air Lines and Toyota, which is Joby's largest external shareholder and is helping the air taxi manufacturer as it builds a factory in Ohio. Archer recently received investments from Boeing, United Airlines and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram, which is helping Archer to establish a factory in Georgia. And Beta is collaborating with UPS to test deliveries in the United Arab Emirates and has raised funds from Fidelity and other investors.

Three Witnesses Describe Final Moments of Sikh Leader: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Three witnesses who said they saw the killers of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the Sikh leader at the center of a diplomatic dispute between Canada and India, described the scene.
The Sikh temple leader wanted as a terrorist by India walked toward his pickup truck late one Sunday last June after a long day at his place of worship. He and an associate discussed some upcoming programs while making their way across the large parking lot behind the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara temple near Vancouver.
It was Father's Day and, once inside his gray Dodge Ram, the leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, called his family and said he was heading right home. But he had barely reached the parking lot's exit when, according to temple officials who have watched the temple's security video, a white vehicle suddenly blocked him. Then, witnesses say, they heard a burst of automatic gunfire and saw two hooded men running away from Mr. Nijjar's immobilized pickup.
"It went on for about 10 seconds," said one witness, Bhupinder Jit Singh, a temple member who was playing soccer in a field next to the parking lot.
Running, Mr. Singh was the first to reach the Dodge Ram, where he found a still-buckled Mr. Nijjar slumped over the center console, his right arm stretched out toward the passenger seat. Bullets had pierced his arms, chest, shoulders and head, spattering blood across his white and light purple shirt. His blue turban was hanging off the right side of his head.
"He didn't seem to be breathing," Mr. Singh, 29, recalled.
The violent, professional-style killing of Mr. Nijjar now lies at the center of a diplomatic clash between Canada and India that comes just as Western allies have been trying to strengthen ties with the Indian government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Interviews with three witnesses to the killing and descriptions of the security footage showing the moments leading up to the shooting provide details about the gunmen whom Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada has branded as "agents" of the Indian government.
The gunmen were dressed in black, with hoods over their heads and black medical masks covering their faces, and one of them dropped a blue medical glove that was later recovered by the police, according to the witnesses. They fired anywhere from 30 to 50 shots at their victim, the witnesses said.
Supporting Canada's charge that India was involved is intelligence, including the intercepted communications of Indian diplomats in Canada indicating their involvement in the plot, according to Western allied officials. India has denied the charges.
Now, the brazen killing threatens to upend not only Canada's relationship with India, but President Biden's efforts to court India as a counterweight to Russia and China.
The Canadian government has said that the killing was orchestrated by the Indian government, which had labeled Mr. Nijjar, a Canadian citizen and a prominent advocate for Sikh separatism in India, a terrorist in 2020 and called for his arrest.
The CBC, which is owned by the federal government, reported that "when pressed behind closed doors, no Indian official has denied the bombshell allegation at the core of this case -- that there is evidence to suggest Indian government involvement in the assassination of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil."
The Canadian government has declined to release details of the intelligence, saying it did not want to prejudice the investigation. But a Canadian government official and Western allied officials said the intelligence had been gathered by multiple countries.
Canada is a member of the so-called Five Eyes, an alliance that shares intelligence information and also includes the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.
In the aftermath of the killing, U.S. intelligence agencies offered their Canadian counterparts context that helped Canada conclude that India had been involved, according to allied officials. Yet what appears to be the "smoking gun," the intercepted communications of Indian diplomats, was gathered by Canadian officials, allied officials said.
At the center of the dispute between Canada and India is Mr. Nijjar, who was 45 when he died. Mr. Nijjar moved to Canada in 1997 after living through more than a decade of deadly conflicts between the Indian government and Sikh separatists in India.
He was one of countless Sikhs to flee India for Canada, which is now home to about 770,000, the largest Sikh community outside India. Mr. Nijjar eventually settled in Surrey, British Columbia, which is home to one of Canada's largest Sikh populations, and where he ran a plumbing business and lived with his wife and two adult sons.
Mr. Nijjar had long championed the creation of an independent Sikh homeland -- carved out of India's Punjab region -- that would be called Khalistan. His advocacy and influence rose to a new level in 2019, when he became the president of the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara temple, the oldest, largest and most politically powerful of the dozen or so Sikh temples in Surrey.
Mr. Nijjar used the temple as a platform from which to openly criticize the Hindu-led Indian government's treatment of its Sikh minority. In 2020, the Indian government declared him a terrorist, and accused him of plotting an attack in India and of leading a terrorist group.
Mr. Nijjar denied those charges. His allies said they were meant to discredit him and undermine their movement. They believe his advocacy led to his killing on June 18.
That morning, Mr. Nijjar had been in a good spirits as he was getting ready to leave home for the temple, recalled his elder son, Balraj Singh Nijjar, 21. Balraj Nijjar and his younger brother had given their father a pair of jeans as a Father's Day gift. Mr. Nijjar, who had a sweet tooth and was trying to lose weight, joked that his sons should have picked a smaller size.
"That would encourage him to diet," Balraj Nijjar recalled.
At the temple, Mr. Nijjar spent the day tending to business and speaking to congregants.
"I spent the whole day with him -- we had lunch and tea together," said Gurmeet Singh Toor, 52, a temple official who had been friends with Mr. Nijjar for the past nine years.
Around 8:30 p.m., Mr. Toor recalled, he and Mr. Nijjar left the temple building together. There was still daylight outside as the two men walked across the parking lot. They said goodbye and went to their respective vehicles.
Inside his pickup truck, Mr. Nijjar called his family, his son Balraj recalled. Told that his wife had made one of his favorite dishes, a sweet dessert called seviyan, Mr. Nijjar sounded happy and said he would be home right away, his son said.
Mr. Nijjar started off, and nearly made it out of the parking lot before the white vehicle blocked his path. Security cameras situated about 400 yards away showed that it was the same white vehicle that had been waiting in the parking lot, according to temple officials who have viewed the security footage.
"As Mr. Nijjar is trying to exit, it speeds up and gets in front of him and blocks him off," said Gurkeerat Singh, 30, a close associate of Mr. Nijjar's who has viewed the security video. "And then two people come -- you can see them on foot."
The two men, who were hiding in a nearby bushy area, were then seen going to the driver's side of Mr. Nijjar's pickup and firing at him, according to the video, Mr. Singh said. The police received a report of a shooting at the temple at 8:27 p.m.
Malkit Singh, 42, who was playing soccer with Bhupinder Jit Singh at the moment of the shooting, said he saw the two gunmen fleeing and began chasing after them.
One of the gunmen was tall and skinny, the other heavyset, Mr. Singh said.
"He was having a hard time running," he said, adding that one of the gunmen brandished a gun in his direction. But Mr. Singh kept following, he said, after he got a phone call from Bhupinder Jit Singh telling him that it was "the president of the gurdwara who had been shot."
Mr. Singh, who had been playing soccer barefoot, said he followed the gunmen across a nearby park and saw them get into the back seat of a silver sedan. The police later identified the getaway vehicle as a silver 2008 Toyota Camry and said its driver had been waiting inside for the gunmen.
As Malkit Singh watched the Camry speed away, he said, the other two witnesses to the shooting were also in pursuit.
Mr. Toor, who had walked out of the temple with Mr. Nijjar, said he was in his own vehicle about 200 yards behind Mr. Nijjar when the shooting took place. He joined Bhupinder Jit Singh, who had run to Mr. Nijjar's pickup.
"I wasn't sure whether he had died or not," Mr. Toor recalled. "I was focused on catching the shooters."
The two men got into Mr. Toor's vehicle and began driving south.
"I assumed they would be going in that direction," Mr. Toor said. "But we weren't able to find them."

Police in L.A. Arrest Suspect In the Killing Of a Deputy: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The deputy, Ryan Clinkunbroomer, 30, was killed Saturday night as he sat in a patrol cruiser near the sheriff's station in Palmdale, Calif.
For more than a day, Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies scoured the high desert city of Palmdale, desperately searching for a man who killed one of their own in an ambush shooting over the weekend. They had little to go on except surveillance video showing an older, dark gray Toyota sedan.
In the early hours Monday, they arrived at a suburban Southern California home, just a few miles from where Deputy Ryan Clinkunbroomer was shot dead while alone in his sheriff's cruiser. The man they sought, served with a warrant, refused to come out and barricaded himself inside. Deputies brought in hostage negotiators and the SWAT team, all to no avail. Hours passed.
Only after they resorted to using chemical agents -- tear gas is common -- did the 29-year-old man emerge from his parents' house. The authorities arrested the suspect, Kevin Cataneo Salazar, and found multiple firearms on scene, Sheriff Robert Luna of Los Angeles County said in an emotional news conference on Monday.
And they found a dark gray Toyota sedan.
"I feel extremely confident that we have the right person in custody," Sheriff Luna said. "I'm going to leave it at that."
Deputy Clinkunbroomer, who was transferred to the Palmdale station in July 2018, had worked in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for about eight years, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and father, officials said. For the past year and a half, he also trained and supervised other deputies, a responsibility bestowed on only the most trustworthy members of the force.
But perhaps the most heartbreaking detail of the tragedy was that, just four days before his death, Deputy Clinkunbroomer had gotten engaged to be married to the "love of his life," his family said.
"Our son Ryan was a dedicated, hardworking deputy sheriff who enjoyed working here at the Palmdale station," the family of Deputy Clinkunbroomer said in a statement that Sheriff Luna read on Monday. "He was proud to work along the side of his partners that he considered brothers and sisters, as he sacrificed daily to better the community that he served. Ryan made the ultimate sacrifice in doing so."
Sheriff Luna described a grieving sheriff's department that finally got their breakthrough after a Sunday afternoon news conference. There, officials released photos and a description of the vehicle, the main clue they had from the shooting. They announced a reward that climbed to $ 250,000 for information leading to an arrest. Tips poured in.
"That was key at this point, leading our detectives to this suspect," Sheriff Luna said. The Sheriff's Department has not determined a motive in the shooting, and homicide investigators are still asking questions. Sheriff Luna said on Monday that he had assumed the deputy was targeted for being a law enforcement officer, "but our intent is to find out."
Five officers have died in situations designated as "ambushes" this year through August, compared with 12 officers killed in such situations in all of last year, according to statistics released by the F.B.I. Eight were killed in 2021 and nine in 2020.
Marle Salazar, the mother of the man arrested on Monday, said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times that her son had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia about five years ago. She added that she had called deputies to respond in the past when he had become too aggressive after not taking his medication.
"That's all part of the investigation," Sheriff Luna said.
"Whether mental health is a factor or not," he added, "think about this: If I had to go to your family and tell them that you were not coming home and that you were just murdered, does it matter what the person was thinking, or their condition?"
Though Palmdale is situated in Los Angeles County, it hardly resembles the Los Angeles that most people know. The city is separated by mountains from the coastal basin, more than an hour's drive away from the Hollywood attractions and the beaches that draw visitors to Southern California. Palmdale grew popular in the late 20th century among aerospace employees who worked nearby, as well as with families searching for cheaper homes -- albeit with a long commute.
Palmdale has a recent history of tension between law enforcement officers and the community. In 2015, the U.S. Justice Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department announced a settlement involving policing changes in Palmdale and the nearby city of Lancaster after an investigation found patterns of excessive use of force, biased practices and unlawful searches and seizures. Monitors have documented a lack of progress toward the goals set in the settlement, though they also recognized "new signs of commitment to reforms" and better communication and transparency in a report this year.

It's Not an Excuse to Say the Trumps Did Worse: [Op-Ed]

Author: Collins, Gail; Stephens, Bret

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/not-excuse-say-trumps-did-worse/docview/2865980491/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gail Collins: Bret, September is one of my favorite months, and I've always kinda wished Congress would stay out on vacation longer. They tend to be a leaky cloud on the horizon.
Let's start with -- oh God, the impeachment inquiry. You're in charge of the Republicans, no matter how you feel about Donald Trump. Give me your take.
Bret Stephens: Gail, if this impeachment inquiry were any more premature, it would be a teenage boy.
Gail: I'm stealing that line.
Bret: I say that as someone who thinks that Hunter Biden's business dealings -- with his family's alleged shell companies and his shady foreign partners and curiously high-priced artwork -- stink to heaven. I also think we in the press need to dig deeper and harder into what his father knew about what his son was up to, whether Joe knowingly lent his name to the enterprise, and who, if anyone, in the wider Biden family benefited from Hunter's activities. And it's no excuse to say the Trumps did worse. Innocence isn't established by arguing that the other guy is a bigger crook.
But, as our colleague David French astutely pointed out last week, "Where is the blue dress?" Every modern impeachment inquiry, from Richard Nixon and the missing 18½ minutes of tape to Bill Clinton and his, er, DNA sample, to Trump's phone call to Volodymyr Zelensky and then the Jan. 6 riot, started from smoking-gun evidence of wrongdoing. What we have here, at most, is secondhand smoke.
Gail: Thirdhand, maybe. Hunter Biden broke the law when he filled out a false gun-purchase form, denying he had a drug use problem. That's bad. He should be punished, but it certainly doesn't have to be by doing time in the slammer.
Bret: Agree. It would probably be enough to sentence Hunter to watch 100 hours of Josh Hawley questioning Senate witnesses. But that might vanquish his hard-earned sobriety.
Gail: When you try to connect Hunter's stupid misdeeds to his father, to argue it's a reason to throw the duly elected president of the United States out of office -- it's like me demanding new antismoking laws in Manhattan because a guy in Canton, Ohio, is puffing on a cigar downtown.
But we're pretty much in concert on this, I think. Next what-about-the-Republicans inquiry: the budget. Is Kevin McCarthy leading -- or not-leading -- us into a government shutdown?
Bret: I love the way McCarthy keeps getting kicked around by the ultra-MAGAites: It's the most poetic bit of justice since Mr. Bumble, the sadist, married Mrs. Corney, the bigger sadist, in "Oliver Twist."
Gail: Yippee! A Dickens reference to Kevin McCarthy. Not as if we had great expectations for his speakership.
Bret: Touché. My guess is that we'll avoid a shutdown with a continuing resolution that funds the government past the end of the month. And I'm sure we'll find a way to fund the Defense Department, too. The longer-term question is how McCarthy can manage a Republican circus in which Donald Trump is the ringmaster, Matt Gaetz cracks the whip and Marjorie Taylor Greene is in charge of the clowns.
And speaking of cracking the whip: Your thoughts on the autoworkers' strike?
Gail: You know, I've been out on strike a few times -- mostly it worked out and got everybody to a decent settlement. Although once, long ago, it did cause the publisher of a small paper I was working on to just pull the plug.
Bret: Uh oh.
Gail: I'm generally on the union side in these things. Organized labor has been a key to the growth of a solid middle- and working-class America. But the U.A.W.'s lack of support for President Biden's effort to move us to electric cars has definitely cooled me.
Bret: Won't surprise you that it's the part of the strike I find most interesting: It shows the growing gap between the Democrats' environmental commitments and the interests of working-class voters.
Gail: Presuming you're hanging with management?
Bret: Er, yep.
I don't blame workers for wanting hefty raises: Inflation has really eaten away at purchasing power. But the U.A.W. wants to more than double the Big Three's labor costs, to about $ 150 an hour from around $ 65 now, which is unsustainable against nonunionized competitors like Toyota, where it's closer to $ 55. The union also wants to go back to the same kind of defined-benefit pension plan that practically bankrupted the Big Three a generation ago.
I'm wondering about the politics of this, too. The administration is standing with the unions, though I'm not sure a long strike helps them as opposed to, say, Trump.
Gail: I'm sure there's a big gap between the ideal contract goals they espouse in public and their real-life targets. But the bottom line is that when profits are raising management pay spectacularly, workers also deserve an unusually nice, substantial raise.
If there's a long strike, which I doubt there will be, we'll come back to it -- this really is one of our most fundamental differences. But in the meantime: Mitt Romney. He's retiring. What are your thoughts?
Bret: You and I both have guilty consciences for being so hard on the guy back when he was running for president.
Now, I think of him as the last good Republican. He was right about the threat posed by Russia back in 2012, when so many Democrats mocked him for it. He was the only Republican senator who voted to convict Trump in his first impeachment trial and one of only seven Republicans who voted for conviction in the second impeachment.
Gail: Mitt Romney was a good governor in Massachusetts, where he proved a cost-conscious Republican could still build a much-needed state health care program. He's been a fine senator who proved it's possible for a Republican to have backbone in the age of Trump.
Those were the arenas he was meant to star in. Sadly, as a presidential candidate, he was terrible. Suddenly retro: "I'm not concerned about the very poor." And very, very boring. It predates your arrival at The Times, but you may remember that I made a thing out of mentioning, every time I wrote about Romney, that he once drove to Canada with the family dog on the roof of the car.
Bret: May remember, Gail?
Gail: It was just a game I'd worked up to rebel against the deep, deep dullness of his candidacy. Still getting pictures of dogs on car roofs from readers after all these years.
But that shouldn't be his political legacy. Mitt, I apologize.
Bret: Me too, Mitt. And in choosing to retire from politics when he's still fit in order to make way for the next generation, Romney's showing that he's right about life -- in the sense that it's good to bow out with grace.
Gail: Bet I know what's coming next.
Bret: Wish I could say the same thing about Joe Biden. Which reminds me to ask your thoughts about David Ignatius's column in The Washington Post that everyone in the chattering classes is talking about, particularly this line: "If he and Harris campaign together in 2024, I think Biden risks undoing his greatest achievement -- which was stopping Trump."
Gail: You and I both bemoaned Biden's decision to run again. We wanted him to announce his planned retirement early so all the other Democratic options -- many attractive possibilities from Congress and state government -- could get out there and introduce themselves to the country.
Didn't happen. And Biden, alas, isn't going to listen to critics unless he suffers some unexpected medical issue.
Bret: That "unexpected medical issue" is the palpable sense of feebleness in Biden's public performances. Not a good look for a guy who wants to spend five more years in the world's most important job.
Gail: But I'm not sure Biden's age gives the race to Trump. And as I've pointed out a billion times, Trump will be 78 if he runs against Biden, and in way worse physical shape. Although he has now started to brag about his long-life genes.
Bret: His awful dad lived to 93. I'll assume his mom was a saint, and she died at 88.
Gail: As to Kamala Harris, she's certainly been improving during her vice presidency. I'd be happy to see her run as a candidate for president -- up against a bunch of other smart, super-achieving Democrats.
Bret: I suspect a lot of people would feel a lot better about voting for Biden next year if they had rock-solid confidence in his veep. Like Harris or not, her unfavorable rating among voters is close to 56 percent, which makes her a huge drag on an already vulnerable ticket. I know a lot of Democrats feel Biden needs a minority woman as a running mate, so why not swap her out for someone like Michelle Lujan Grisham, the Hispanic governor of New Mexico, or Mellody Hobson, the superstar businesswoman, or Val Demings, the former congresswoman from Florida? I also think Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, would also be a great veep choice, even if she isn't a minority woman, because she's just incredibly talented. Remember that F.D.R. tossed out Henry Wallace for Harry Truman in 1944. That's the historical analogy Biden ought to be thinking of now.
Gail: Does sound very attractive. But Bret, you know that sort of thing isn't done anymore. You don't dump your loyal, hard-working vice president. Who also happens to be of Jamaican and Indian descent. Swapping for another minority woman just seems ... tacky.
If Biden bowed out, it'd be perfectly reasonable for all those other good candidates to jump in. But as things stand they are, sigh, as they are.
Bret: I'll grant you the tacky part. But I can think of something a lot worse: Donald Trump back in the White House. When those are the stakes, being tacky seems a small price to pay for national self-preservation.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The officer was found unconscious in his patrol car in Palmdale, a city near Los Angeles. It was unclear whether there was more than one suspect or what the motive was.
Investigators searched for clues on Sunday following the ambush-style killing of a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, as outpourings of grief flowed over the officer's dedication to public service.
The deputy, Ryan Clinkunbroomer, 30, was found unconscious, with a gunshot wound to the head, by a passer-by on Saturday evening, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. The deputy was in his patrol cruiser near the sheriff's station in Palmdale, Calif., about a 60-mile drive north of the city of Los Angeles.
Deputy Clinkunbroomer, who had been on duty and in uniform, was shot leaving the Palmdale station while at a red light, officials said. He was rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead from his injuries.
At a news conference on Sunday, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said that it was unclear whether there was more than one suspect, and that the authorities did not know of a motive. But officials described a "vehicle of interest" as a 2006-2012 dark gray Toyota Corolla, and they announced a $ 250,000 award for information leading to a suspect's arrest and prosecution.
"Please, I beg you. Somebody has information," he said. "Please make things right."
Sheriff Luna had said earlier that the shooting was being investigated by "homicide teams, major crimes teams, gang teams." Investigators believed that the killing was captured on surveillance video, he said, and they were analyzing a video that had been circulating online to determine whether it was related to the shooting.
Deputy Clinkunbroomer, who was transferred to the Palmdale station in July 2018, had worked in the sheriff's department for about eight years, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and father, Sheriff Luna said. For the past year and a half, he also trained and supervised deputies. "Not just anybody becomes a field training officer," Sheriff Luna said. "It's usually the best of the best."
"Our deputy was a devoted family member and a cherished community member," Sheriff Luna said in a statement.
Deputy Clinkunbroomer had gotten engaged just four days earlier, he added.
News of the killing rattled officials and residents in Palmdale, a hot, dry city of about 160,000 in far northeastern Los Angeles County. Laura Bettencourt, the city's mayor, called Deputy Clinkunbroomer a "hero" in a news conference on Saturday night and vowed that the person who shot him, whom she called a "coward," would be caught.
In a statement posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, Palmdale Sheriff's Station said that Deputy Clinkunbroomer "strived for excellence in everything he did," adding that he "genuinely cared for the community he served."
On Sunday afternoon in Palmdale, many people stopped by the sheriff's station to pay their respects. A memorial with flowers and candles sprung up on the sidewalk outside the station at Avenue Q and Sierra Highway, the intersection where Deputy Clinkunbroomer was shot.
The site of the shooting and the sheriff's station sit near a few low-slung homes, some with fences in need of repair. Yellow vans advertising bail bonds are parked, along with other vehicles, in one yard.
Michael Berbiar, 53, a retired Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, came to pay tribute with his wife, Yesenia, from their home in Santa Clarita, about 40 miles away.
"I've lost several friends and co-workers that have been killed in the line of duty, and this just kind of brings me back to them and how important law enforcement is to the community," Mr. Berbiar said.
Flowers were also placed by residents on the hood of a police cruiser blocking Avenue Q.
On Sunday night, at a vigil outside the sheriff's station to honor the deputy, affectionately called "clink," officials and clergy urged the Antelope Valley community to come together.
Fire trucks lined up on Sierra Highway adjacent to the station, whose walls were lit up in blue, as several hundred people gathered on the lawn and in the area in front of the facility. About 30 minutes into the vigil, those gathered were asked to light candles or hold up their phones in the air. Most everyone did.
Brenda Grosso, a family law paralegal whose son is a Los Angeles Police officer, attended with her 11-year-old daughter, Marianne. They were handing out candles that came with a blue wrap.
"We prayed for the family," Ms. Grosso said, adding that they were devastated and scared for Deputy Clinkunbroomer's loved ones, especially because they know what it is like being a law enforcement family.
"We never want to get that call," she said.
According to statistics released by the F.B.I. on officers killed in the line of duty, there have been five officers who died this year through August in situations designated as "ambushes." Last year, 12 officers were killed on the job in such situations; eight were killed in 2021 and nine in 2020.
Palmdale has a recent history of tension between law enforcement and the community. In 2015, the U.S. Justice Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department announced a settlement involving a set of police reforms in Palmdale and the nearby city of Lancaster after an investigation found patterns of excessive use of force, biased policing practices and unlawful searches and seizures.
Monitors overseeing the reforms in Palmdale and Lancaster have documented a lack of progress in the past two years toward the goals set in the settlement, including a resistance to change and denial of responsibility. Their report this year cited several areas in need of improvement, including daily interactions with the public, but it also recognized "new signs of commitment to reforms" and better communication and transparency.

3 Automakers And U.A.W. Resume Talks: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United Auto Workers said it had "reasonably productive conversations with Ford" but did not mention G.M. or Stellantis.
The United Auto Workers union and the three Detroit automakers on Saturday resumed negotiations on a new labor contract as a targeted strike entered its second day.
The union is striking against all three manufacturers -- General Motors, Ford and Stellantis -- but for now has limited the work stoppages to one plant at each of the companies: a Ford plant in Michigan, a G.M. plant in Missouri and a Stellantis plant in Ohio.
"We had reasonably productive conversations with Ford today," the union said in a statement. It made no mention of its talks with G.M. and Stellantis.
On Friday Ford said it had told 600 workers who are not part of the strike not to report to work, and G.M. said the work stoppage could force it to lay off about 2,000 workers at a plant in Kansas that gets parts from the Missouri factory.
In a statement on Saturday, the U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, said the automakers' hints at possible layoffs were intended to "squeeze our member to settle for less" than the union has demanded.
"With their record profits, they don't have to lay off a single employee," he said.
The union is seeking a substantial pay increase, an expansion of pension plans to cover all workers, company-paid retiree health care and shorter work weeks. It also seeks an end to the "tiered" wage system in which new hires start at a little more than half the standard union wage and have to work eight years before reaching the top level.
In its initial list of demands, the U.A.W. called for a 40 percent wage increase, saying that matches the average pay increase the chief executives of the three companies have gotten over the last four years.
On Saturday, Stellantis -- the parent of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram -- said its most recent offer provided for an immediate 10 percent raise and additional increases that would lift wages a total of 21 percent over the life of the new contract, which is typically four years.
The company also said it offered to allow inflation-based wage adjustments. Under its proposal, new hires would rise to the top wage -- currently $ 32 an hour -- over four years instead of eight. Temporary workers, who now make $ 16.67 an hour, would move to about $ 21 an hour, Stellantis said.
"It's a very fair, highly competitive offer," Mark Stewart, chief operating officer of Stellantis's North American division, said in a conference call.
"We clearly understand we've been in an inflationary environment," Mr. Stewart said. "We understand we need to make changes to reflect what's happened since the last contract." At the same time, he continued, the company has to make sure it can compete with rivals that operate nonunion plants, including Tesla and foreign-owned automakers like Toyota, Honda and Volkswagen.
"We've got to have a viable industry," Mr. Stewart said. "At the end of the day, we have to be able to compete."
G.M. and Ford have made similar offers on wages and reducing the climb to the top wage to four years, but all three companies have rejected many of the union's other demands related to pensions, health care, and job security.
Mr. Stewart also said Stellantis made a proposal to provide "job security" for about 1,350 people who lost their jobs earlier this year when Stellantis idled a plant in Belvidere, Ill. He declined to detail the company's offer and would not say if it included having the Belvidere plant produce new vehicles, a step that would signal it planned a full reopening of the factory.
That offer only remained on the table until the strike began, however.
Later on Saturday, Mr. Fain released a statement: "Belvidere Assembly was a profitable plant that just a few years ago supported around 5000 workers and their families. Now that number is zero, and Stellantis wants to keep playing games." He added, "Our attitude is: Save Belvidere."
Reopening that plant is one of the most important goals for Mr. Fain. He was elected to his post earlier this year on a promise to take a harder and more confrontational approach than his predecessors.
Four years ago, the U.A.W. went on strike for 40 days against G.M. and hoped to push the company to reopen a plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that G.M. had tagged for closing. In the end, the union agreed to a deal that allowed the company to shutter the factory.

Key to Walkout: Industry's Shift To Electric Cars: [National Desk]

Full text: Carmakers are anxious to keep costs down as they ramp up electric vehicle manufacturing, while striking workers want to preserve jobs as the industry shifts to batteries.
A battle between Detroit carmakers and the United Auto Workers union, which escalated on Friday with targeted strikes in three locations, is unfolding amid a once-in-a-century technological upheaval that poses huge risks for both the companies and the union.
The strike has come as the traditional automakers invest billions to develop electric vehicles while still making most of their money from gasoline-driven cars. The negotiations will determine the balance of power between workers and management, possibly for years to come. That makes the strike as much a struggle for the industry's future as it is about wages, benefits and working conditions.
The established carmakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Jeep and Ram -- are trying to defend their profits and their place in the market in the face of stiff competition from Tesla and foreign automakers. Some executives and analysts have characterized what is happening in the industry as the biggest technological transformation since Henry Ford's moving assembly line started up at the beginning of the 20th century.
Nearly 13,000 U.A.W. workers walked off the job at three plants in Ohio, Michigan and Missouri on Friday after talks between the unions and the companies in three separate negotiations failed to result in agreements before a Thursday deadline. Pay is one of the biggest sticking points: The union is demanding a 40 percent pay increase over four years but the automakers have offered roughly half as much.
But the talks are about more than pay. Workers are trying to defend jobs as manufacturing shifts from internal combustion engines to batteries. Because they have fewer parts, electric cars can be made with fewer workers than gasoline vehicles. A favorable outcome for the U.A.W. would also give the union a strong calling card if, as some expect, it then tries to organize employees at Tesla and other nonunion carmakers like Hyundai, which is planning to manufacture electric vehicles at a massive new factory in Georgia.
"The transition to E.V.s is dominating every bit of this discussion," said John Casesa, senior managing director at the investment firm Guggenheim Partners who previously headed strategy at Ford Motor.
"It's unspoken," Mr. Casesa added. "But really, it's all about positioning the union to have a central role in the new electric industry."
Under pressure from government officials and changing consumer demand, Ford, G.M. and Stellantis are investing billions to retool their sprawling operations to build electric vehicles, which are critical to addressing climate change. But they are making little if any profit on those vehicles while Tesla, which dominates electric car sales, is profitable and growing fast.
Ford said in July that its electric vehicle business would lose $ 4.5 billion this year. If the union got all the increases in pay, pensions and other benefits it is seeking, the company said, its workers' total compensation would be twice as much as Tesla's employees.
Union demands would force Ford to scrap its investments in electric vehicles, Jim Farley, the company's chief executive, said in an interview on Friday. "We want to actually have a conversation about a sustainable future," he said, "not one that forces us to choose between going out of business and rewarding our workers."
For workers, the biggest concern is that electric vehicles have far fewer parts than gasoline models and will render many jobs obsolete. Plants that make mufflers, catalytic converters, fuel injectors and other components that electric cars don't need will have to be overhauled or shut down.
Many new battery and electric vehicle factories are springing up and could employ workers from the plants that have shut down. But automakers are building most aggressively in the South where labor laws are tilted against union organizers, rather than in the Midwest, where the U.A.W. has more clout. One of the union's demands is that workers in the new factories be covered by the automakers' national labor contracts -- a demand that the automakers have said they can't meet because those plants are owned by joint ventures. The union also wants to regain the right to strike to block plant shutdowns.
"We are at the dawn of another industrial revolution and the way we're going is the way we went in the last industrial revolution -- a lot of profit for a few and misery and not good jobs for the many," said Madeline Janis, executive director of Jobs to Move America, an advocacy group that works closely with the U.A.W. and other unions.
"The U.A.W. is really taking a stand for communities across the country to make sure this transition benefits everybody," Ms. Janis added.
Automakers have been racking up record profits during the last decade, but they cannot afford to lose time from work stoppages in their race to compete with Tesla and foreign automakers.
The three companies are already struggling to get their electric vehicle business going. A new G.M. battery factory in Ohio has been slow to produce batteries, delaying electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and other vehicles. Ford this year had to suspend production of its electric F-150 Lightning in February after a battery caught fire in one of the pickups that was parked near the factory for a quality check. And Stellantis won't even begin selling any fully electric vehicles in the United States until next year.
Those problems and Tesla's growing sales could put the union in a strong position to extract a good deal.
On Thursday, in a sign that automakers are willing to go much further than they had previously, G.M. offered a 20 percent pay raise over four years. That is half of what the union is seeking but far more than workers received in recent contracts. President Biden on Friday strongly supported the union in remarks at the White House. The administration has been pouring billions into programs to promote electric vehicles and does not want a strike to delay a centerpiece of its climate policy.
Despite all the money that automakers have made in recent years, their executives express a profound unease about the growth of electric vehicles, which account for 7 percent of the U.S. new car market so far this year and are on track to surpass sales of one million this year. Managers are acutely aware that traditional companies like theirs have a poor track record of retaining dominance after a big change in technology. Witness the way that Apple sidelined Nokia and Motorola as cellphones became smartphones.
Auto company executives and most industry analysts underestimated how quickly electric vehicles would catch on and cannot confidently forecast how sales, which have been bumpy lately, will grow in the future. "I don't think anyone can perfectly predict what the adoption will be," Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said in an interview with The New York Times last month.
Speaking to "CBS Mornings" on Friday, Ms. Barra said an excessive pay raise would undermine G.M.'s ability to continue producing vehicles with internal combustion engines while also developing electric vehicles. "This is a critical juncture where investing is very important," she said.
Still, unions and their supporters are unlikely to express much sympathy for auto executives. Ms. Barra, Mr. Farley of Ford and the chief executive of Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, have gotten tens of millions of dollars in compensation packages in recent years. The companies' shareholders have been rewarded with dividends and share buybacks.
Unions "are not going to have a lot of patience for sob stories," said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, an online marketplace.
Adjusted for inflation, wages for autoworkers in the United States have fallen 19 percent since 2008, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group.
At the same time, union officials are aware of the changes in the industry and have said they do not want to handicap G.M., Ford and Stellantis as the companies try to recover ground they have lost to Tesla, which has aggressively resisted attempts to unionize its factories. The Detroit carmakers also face challengers like Rivian, a start-up that makes electric pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in Illinois, as well as foreign-owned rivals like Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, whose U.S. factories, mostly in the South, are not unionized.
"That's the biggest challenge here," Mr. Brauer added, "trying to commit to a long-term contract in an industry that is very uncertain and unpredictable over the next five years."
Union supporters say it would be wrong to blame workers if the traditional carmakers cannot compete with Tesla and other rivals.
"If you look at the breakdown at what it costs to build an E.V., labor is a very small part of the equation. Batteries are the most," Ms. Janis of Jobs to Move America said. "This idea that the U.A.W. is going to price Ford, G.M. and Stellantis out of the market is not true."
But other analysts said that a long work stoppage could help Tesla and foreign automakers gain ground on G.M., Ford and Stellantis.
"If something happens to disrupt their business, does that give a leg up to the emerging electric vehicle makers?" said Steve Patton, who overseas the consulting firm EY's work with auto companies. "Who stands to benefit if there is a protracted strike?"

Union demands would force Ford to scrap its investments in electric vehicles, Jim Farley, the company’s CEO, said in an interview Friday. “We want to actually have a conversation about a sustainable future,” he said, “not one that forces us to choose between going out of business and rewarding our workers.”
For workers, the biggest concern is that electric vehicles have far fewer parts than gasoline models and will render many jobs obsolete. Plants that make mufflers, catalytic converters, fuel injectors and other components that electric cars don’t need will have to be overhauled or shut down.
Many new battery and electric vehicle factories are springing up and could employ workers from the plants that have shut down. But automakers are building most aggressively in the South, where labor laws are tilted against union organizers, rather than in the Midwest, where the UAW has more clout. One of the union’s demands is that workers in the new factories be covered by the automakers’ national labor contracts — a demand that the automakers have said they can’t meet because those plants are owned by joint ventures. The union also wants to regain the right to strike to block plant shutdowns.
“We are at the dawn of another industrial revolution, and the way we’re going is the way we went in the last industrial revolution — a lot of profit for a few and misery and not good jobs for the many,” said Madeline Janis, executive director of Jobs to Move America, an advocacy group that works closely with the UAW and other unions.
“The UAW is really taking a stand for communities across the country to make sure this transition benefits everybody,” Janis added.
Automakers have been racking up record profits during the last decade, but they cannot afford to lose time from work stoppages in their race to compete with Tesla and foreign automakers.
The three companies are already struggling to get their electric vehicle business going. A new GM battery factory in Ohio has been slow to produce batteries, delaying electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and other vehicles. Ford had to suspend production of its electric F-150 Lightning in February after a battery caught fire in one of the pickups that was parked near the factory for a quality check. And Stellantis won’t even begin selling fully electric vehicles in the United States until next year.
Those problems and Tesla’s growing sales could put the union in a strong position to extract a good deal.
On Thursday, in a sign that automakers are willing to go much further than they had previously, GM offered a 20% pay raise over four years. That is half of what the union is seeking but far more than workers received in recent contracts. President Joe Biden on Friday strongly supported the union in remarks at the White House. The administration has been pouring billions into programs to promote electric vehicles and does not want a strike to delay a centerpiece of its climate policy.
Despite all the money that automakers have made in recent years, their executives express a profound unease about the growth of electric vehicles, which account for 7% of the U.S. new car market so far this year and are on track to surpass sales of 1 million this year. Managers are acutely aware that traditional companies like theirs have a poor track record of retaining dominance after a big change in technology. Witness the way that Apple sidelined Nokia and Motorola as cellphones became smartphones.
Auto company executives and most industry analysts underestimated how quickly electric vehicles would catch on and cannot confidently forecast how sales, which have been bumpy lately, will grow in the future. “I don’t think anyone can perfectly predict what the adoption will be,” Mary Barra, the CEO of GM, said in an interview with The New York Times last month.
Speaking to “CBS Mornings” on Friday, Barra said an excessive pay raise would undermine GM’s ability to continue producing vehicles with internal combustion engines while also developing electric vehicles. “This is a critical juncture where investing is very important,” she said.
Still, unions and their supporters are unlikely to express much sympathy for auto executives. Barra, Farley of Ford and the CEO of Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, have gotten tens of millions of dollars in compensation packages in recent years. The companies’ shareholders have been rewarded with dividends and share buybacks.
Unions “are not going to have a lot of patience for sob stories,” said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, an online marketplace.
Adjusted for inflation, wages for autoworkers in the United States have fallen 19% since 2008, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group.
At the same time, union officials are aware of the changes in the industry and have said they do not want to handicap GM, Ford and Stellantis as the companies try to recover ground they have lost to Tesla, which has aggressively resisted attempts to unionize its factories. The Detroit carmakers also face challengers like Rivian, a startup that makes electric pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in Illinois, as well as foreign-owned rivals like Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, whose U.S. factories, mostly in the South, are not unionized.
“That’s the biggest challenge here,” Brauer said, “trying to commit to a long-term contract in an industry that is very uncertain and unpredictable over the next five years.”
Union supporters say it would be wrong to blame workers if the traditional carmakers cannot compete with Tesla and other rivals.
“If you look at the breakdown at what it costs to build an EV, labor is a very small part of the equation. Batteries are the most,” Janis said. “This idea that the UAW is going to price Ford, GM and Stellantis out of the market is not true.”
But other analysts said that a long work stoppage could help Tesla and foreign automakers gain ground on GM, Ford and Stellantis.
“If something happens to disrupt their business, does that give a leg up to the emerging electric vehicle makers?” said Steve Patton, who overseas consulting firm EY’s work with auto companies. "Who stands to benefit if there is a protracted strike?”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Autoworkers walked off the job on Friday at three factories that produce some of the Detroit carmakers' most popular vehicles, the opening salvos in what could become a protracted strike that hurts the U.S. economy and has an impact on the 2024 presidential election.
Nearly 13,000 members of the United Auto Workers at plants in Ohio, Michigan and Missouri joined early Friday in what the union described as a targeted strike that could expand to more plants if its demands for pay raises of up to 40 percent and other gains were not met.
The union's four-year contracts with three automakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Jeep and Ram -- expired Thursday, and the companies and the union remained far from striking new deals.
The U.A.W.'s president, Shawn Fain, used sweeping language on Thursday to describe why his members were going on strike against all three automakers at the same time -- something the union had never done in its nearly 90-year history.
"This is our generation's defining moment," Mr. Fain, the union's first leader elected directly by members, said in an online video. "The money is there, the cause is righteous, the world is watching, and the U.A.W. is ready to stand up."
The union and the companies did not negotiate on Friday, but the U.A.W. said it planned to resume bargaining on Saturday. President Biden dispatched two senior administration officials to Detroit on Friday to encourage the companies and union to reach agreements.
At a Ford plant in Wayne, Mich., west of Detroit, strikers waved placards -- one read, "Record Profits; Record Contracts" -- and gave thumbs-up to honking vehicles. A metal sign on a chain-link fence read, "Absolutely NO foreign cars allowed." The protesters were assigned to a six-hour shift on the picket line. If the strike continues, they will be called to one shift per week.
While first and foremost a battle between autoworkers and automakers, the conflict could have far-reaching consequences. A lengthy strike would reduce the number of new cars available for sale, which could fuel inflation and force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high.
A strike also presents a quandary for Mr. Biden, who has called for rising incomes but must also be mindful of the strike's economic impact and his goal to promote electric vehicles as a solution to climate change.
Speaking at the White House on Friday, the president strongly supported the union. "Over the past decade, auto companies have seen record profits, including in the last few years, because of the extraordinary skill and sacrifices of U.A.W. workers," he said. "But those record profits have not been shared fairly."
The U.A.W. says its pay demands roughly correspond to the increases in the compensation of the top executives at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis. The raises are also meant to help compensate workers for the ground they have lost to inflation and big concessions the union made to the automakers after the 2007-8 financial crisis, when G.M. and Chrysler were forced to restructure themselves in bankruptcy court.
But auto executives say they already pay production workers substantially more than rivals, like Tesla and Toyota, whose U.S. workers are not unionized. The companies also contend that such big raises would undermine their efforts to develop electric vehicles and remain relevant as the industry makes a difficult and costly shift from gasoline cars and trucks to electric vehicles.
If unions got all that they were asking for, "we would have to cancel our E.V. investments," Jim Farley, the chief executive of Ford, said in an interview on Friday. Instead, Ford would need to concentrate on large sport utility vehicles and pickups that generate the most profit, he said.
Ford, which employs the most union members, reported a profit of $ 1.9 billion in the second quarter, equal to 4 percent of its sales. Tesla made $ 2.7 billion in the same period, about 11 percent of its sales.
Mr. Farley sounded pessimistic about the chances of agreeing on a contract soon. "They are not negotiating in good faith if they are proposing deals that they know are going to crater our investments," he said.
Mr. Fain's decision to shut down just three factories is a departure for the union, which in previous strikes typically walked out of all the factories of a single automaker. By interrupting production of some of the most profitable vehicles, while allowing most plants to keep operating, the union hopes to inflict pain on the carmakers while allowing most of its members to continue collecting paychecks.
But it may be difficult for the union to limit the damage to its members' incomes. Ford told workers at a facility in Michigan, who were not on strike, to stay home Friday because of parts shortages caused by the strike. G.M. said it would probably lay off 2,000 workers at a factory in Kansas next week because of a lack of parts produced at the factory near St. Louis that is on strike.
Fewer than 10 percent of the nearly 150,000 U.A.W. members at the three companies are on strike. Limited strikes could allow the union to maintain the pressure longer by preserving its strike fund of $ 825 million. The union will pay striking workers $ 500 a week and cover their health insurance premiums.
In addition to the Ford plant in Michigan, which makes the Bronco and the Ranger pickup truck, and the G.M. plant in Wentzville, Mo., which makes the GMC Canyon and the Chevrolet Colorado, workers shut down a Stellantis complex in Toledo, Ohio, that makes the Jeep Gladiator and Jeep Wrangler. If no agreement is reached, the union is expected to target additional factories in weeks to come.
The union is also seeking cost-of-living adjustments that would protect workers if inflation flares up again. And it wants to reinstate pensions that the union agreed to do away with for newer workers after the financial crisis, improved retiree benefits and shorter work hours. The union also wants to eliminate a wage system that starts new hires at much lower wages than the top U.A.W. pay of $ 32 an hour.
As of Friday last week, the companies had offered to raise pay by around 14.5 percent to 20 percent over four years. Their offers include lump-sum payments to help offset the effects of inflation, and policy changes that would lift the pay of recent hires and temporary workers, who typically earn about a third less than veteran union members.
In a last-minute attempt to keep assembly lines running, G.M. offered its employees a 20 percent raise late Thursday and said it was willing to pay cost-of-living adjustments to veteran workers. The 20 percent increase would be far more than employees had received in decades. But the union rejected the offer, which it says would barely compensate for inflation.
Leaders of the automakers have criticized the U.A.W.'s tactics, focusing on Mr. Fain, who became president in March and declared an end to what he said were overly friendly relations between union leaders and auto executives. He took office after a federal corruption investigation resulted in prison terms for two former U.A.W. presidents.
Carlos Tavares, the chief executive of Stellantis, has called Mr. Fain's strategy "posturing." Mr. Farley of Ford said the two sides should be negotiating instead of "planning strikes and P.R. events." And Mary T. Barra, the G.M. chief executive, said that "every negotiation takes on the personality of its leader."
If the autoworkers are successful, they could inspire workers in other industries. Union activism is on the rise: Hollywood screenwriters and actors have been on strike for months, and in August, United Parcel Service employees won their biggest raises ever in a contract negotiated by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
"Workers have been squeezed for too long and now are realizing they can do something about it," said Mijin Cha, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who studies the relationship between labor's interests and the fight against climate change. "People see there is a pathway to more economic security and workers do have power together."
Late on Friday, at an outdoor rally in downtown Detroit attended by several hundred U.A.W. members, Mr. Fain introduced Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, who told the crowd: "The fight you are waging here is not just about decent wages and working conditions and pensions in the auto industry. It's a fight to take on corporate greed."
The strikes come as auto production is still recovering from the effects of the pandemic, which caused shortages of semiconductors and other components. Car prices and wait times have come down, but dealer inventories remain low and a lengthy strike could eventually make it hard to find popular U.S.-made models.
"We're not back to speed inventory-wise," said Wes Lutz, the owner of Extreme Dodge, a car dealership in Jackson, Mich.
Scarcity is not always bad for carmakers. It allowed them to earn higher profit margins during the pandemic. And it would benefit any carmakers that were having trouble moving some models. Pat Ryan, chief executive of the car-shopping app Co-Pilot, said that Stellantis had at least 100 days of inventory for brands like Dodge and Chrysler, and that a strike could help it clear many dealers' lots.
Still, if prices for popular models rise, that will be yet another speed bump in the Federal Reserve's road to lowering inflation, and a political liability for Mr. Biden. The president, who has no formal role in the negotiations, said Friday that he had been in touch with union leaders and auto executives, in addition to dispatching the two administration officials to Detroit.

Autoworkers walked off the job Friday at three factories that produce some of the Detroit carmakers’ most popular vehicles, the opening salvos in what could become a protracted strike that hurts the U.S. economy and has an impact on the 2024 presidential election.
Nearly 13,000 members of the United Auto Workers at plants in Ohio, Michigan and Missouri joined early Friday in what the union described as a targeted strike that could expand to more plants if its demands for pay raises of up to 40% and other gains were not met.
The union’s four-year contracts with three automakers — General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Jeep and Ram — expired Thursday, and the companies and the union remained far from striking new deals.
UAW President Shawn Fain used sweeping language Thursday to describe why his members were going on strike against all three automakers at the same time — something the union had never done in its nearly 90-year history.
“This is our generation’s defining moment,” Fain, the union’s first leader elected directly by members, said in an online video. “The money is there, the cause is righteous, the world is watching, and the UAW is ready to stand up.”
The union and the companies did not negotiate Friday, and the UAW said it planned to resume bargaining Saturday. President Joe Biden dispatched two senior administration officials to Detroit on Friday to encourage the companies and union to reach agreements.
At a Ford plant in Wayne, Michigan, west of Detroit, strikers waved placards — one read, “Record Profits; Record Contracts” — and gave the thumbs-up to honking vehicles. A metal sign on a chain-link fence read, “Absolutely NO foreign cars allowed.” The protesters were assigned to a six-hour shift on the picket line. If the strike continues, they will be called to one shift per week.
While first and foremost a battle between autoworkers and automakers, the conflict could have far-reaching consequences. A lengthy strike would reduce the number of new cars available for sale, which could fuel inflation and force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high.
A strike also presents a quandary for Biden, who has called for rising incomes but must also be mindful of the strike’s economic impact and his goal to promote electric vehicles as a solution to climate change.
Speaking at the White House on Friday, the president strongly supported the union. “Over the past decade, auto companies have seen record profits, including in the last few years, because of the extraordinary skill and sacrifices of UAW workers,” he said. “But those record profits have not been shared fairly.”
The UAW says its pay demands roughly correspond to the increases in the compensation of the top executives at Ford, GM and Stellantis. The raises are also meant to help compensate workers for the ground they have lost to inflation and big concessions the union made to the automakers after the 2007-08 financial crisis, when GM and Chrysler were forced to restructure themselves in bankruptcy court.
But auto executives say they already pay production workers substantially more than rivals, like Tesla and Toyota, whose U.S. workers are not unionized. The companies also contend that such big raises would undermine their efforts to develop electric vehicles and remain relevant as the industry makes a difficult and costly shift from gasoline cars and trucks to electric vehicles.
Ford, which employs the most union members, reported a profit of $1.9 billion in the second quarter, equal to 4% of its sales. Tesla made $2.7 billion in the same period, about 11% of its sales.
Mary Barra, the CEO of GM, said the strikes would hurt the industry. “I’m extremely frustrated and disappointed,” she told CNBC on Friday. “We don’t need to be on strike right now.” She said the company had “put a historic offer on the table” that included better job security and “world-class health care.”
Fain’s decision to shut down just three factories is also a departure for the union, which in previous strikes typically walked out of all the factories of a single automaker. By interrupting production of some of the most profitable vehicles, while allowing most plants to keep operating, the union hopes to inflict pain on the carmakers while allowing most of its members to continue collecting paychecks.
Fewer than 10% of the nearly 150,000 UAW members at the three companies are on strike. Limited strikes could allow the union to maintain the pressure longer by preserving its strike fund of $825 million. The union will pay striking workers $500 a week and cover their health insurance premiums.
In addition to the Ford plant in Michigan, which makes the Bronco and the Ranger pickup truck, workers shut down production at a GM plant in Wentzville, Missouri, near St. Louis, that makes the GMC Canyon and the Chevrolet Colorado and a Stellantis complex in Toledo, Ohio, that makes the Jeep Gladiator and Jeep Wrangler. If no agreement is reached, the union is expected to target additional factories in weeks to come.
The union is also seeking cost-of-living adjustments that would protect workers if inflation flares up again. And it wants to reinstate pensions that the union agreed to do away with for newer workers after the financial crisis; improved retiree benefits; and shorter work hours. The union also wants to eliminate a wage system that starts new hires at much lower wages than the top UAW pay of $32 an hour.
As of last Friday, the companies had offered to raise pay by around 14.5% to 20% over four years. Their offers include lump-sum payments to help offset the effects of inflation, and policy changes that would lift the pay of recent hires and temporary workers, who typically earn about one-third less than veteran union members.
In a last-minute attempt to keep assembly lines running, GM late Thursday offered its employees a 20% raise and said it was willing to pay cost-of-living adjustments to veteran workers. The 20% increase would be far more than employees had received in decades. But the union rejected the offer, which it says would barely compensate for inflation.
Leaders of the automakers have criticized the UAW’s tactics, focusing on Fain, who became president in March and declared an end to what he said were overly friendly relations between union leaders and auto executives. He took office after a federal corruption investigation resulted in prison terms for two former UAW presidents.
Carlos Tavares, the CEO of Stellantis, has called Fain’s strategy “posturing.” Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, said the two sides should be negotiating instead of “planning strikes and PR events.” And Barra of GM said that “every negotiation takes on the personality of its leader.”
If the autoworkers are successful, they could inspire workers in other industries. Union activism is on the rise: Hollywood screenwriters and actors have been on strike for months. In August, United Parcel Service employees won their biggest raises ever in a contract negotiated by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
“Workers have been squeezed for too long and now are realizing they can do something about it,” said Mijin Cha, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who studies the relationship between labor’s interests and the fight against climate change. “People see there is a pathway to more economic security and workers do have power together.”
The strikes come as auto production is still recovering from the effects of the pandemic, which caused shortages of semiconductors and other components. Car prices and wait times have come down, but dealer inventories remain low and a lengthy strike could eventually make it hard to find popular U.S.-made models.
“We’re not back to speed inventory-wise,” said Wes Lutz, the owner of Extreme Dodge, a car dealership in Jackson, Michigan.
Scarcity is not always bad for carmakers. It allowed them to earn higher profit margins during the pandemic. And it would benefit any carmakers that were having trouble moving some models. Pat Ryan, CEO of car-shopping app Co-Pilot, said that Stellantis had at least 100 days of inventory for brands like Dodge and Chrysler, and that a strike could help it clear many dealers’ lots.
Still, if prices for popular models rise, that will be yet another speed bump in the Fed’s road to lowering inflation, and a political liability for Biden. The president, who has no formal role in the negotiations, said Friday that he had been in touch with union leaders and auto executives, in addition to dispatching the two administration officials to Detroit.
It is unclear how much of an effect the administration’s intervention will have on automakers or the union.
Despite Biden’s pro-union statements, Fain has withheld the UAW’s endorsement for president despite generally backing Democrats, and he criticized federal incentives and loans to automakers for electric vehicle and battery production that do not require new factories to be unionized.
Former President Donald Trump, the front-runner in the Republican primary race, has been courting UAW workers and attacked Biden’s electric vehicle policies as bad for workers and consumers.

Toyota's Electric Vehicles Could Use a Boost: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The world's largest carmaker dominates the sales of hybrid cars but has been slow to sell all-electric vehicles, alienating some customers and hurting sales.
Rachel Culin considered herself a Toyota loyalist, one of millions of people who appreciated the company's reliable and fuel-efficient hybrids. But she recently bought an electric Chevrolet Bolt to replace her Toyota Prius because the Japanese automaker had been too slow when it came to selling electric vehicles.
"Where are the options for those people who love Toyota?" Ms. Culin, a resident of Mesa, Ariz., said. "It's really sad."
Once the leading brand for environmentally conscious car owners, Toyota has failed to keep up with changing consumer preferences and a push by governments around the world to greatly reduce the burning of fossil fuels, the main cause of climate change.
The company and the Japanese auto industry are facing the biggest business challenge they have confronted since becoming global giants in the 1980s. How they respond could determine whether they remain at the top of the auto industry or become afterthoughts.
Toyota, the world's largest automaker, is the nucleus of power for the country's large auto industry. It has alliances with smaller automakers like Subaru and Mazda and wields enormous influence over government officials and industry groups. The company is also a major employer in the United States, with nearly 30,000 workers in Kentucky, Indiana, Texas and other states.
Its business decisions can have far-reaching economic and environmental implications. Toyota arguably did more to improve fuel efficiency and cut emissions than any other established automaker by pioneering hybrid cars that augment a gasoline engine with a battery and an electric motor. But having staked so much on hybrids, it has moved slowly to cars that produce no tailpipe emissions.
That has opened room for Tesla and BYD, a Chinese automaker, to challenge Toyota's dominance by offering appealing and affordable battery electric cars. Toyota has lost market share in the United States, and its sales in China have fallen.
Japanese carmakers have been here before. But last time they were the insurgents.
In the 1970s, with fuel prices soaring, Americans began replacing gas-guzzling cars with small, fuel-efficient Japanese models, challenging the dominance of General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler.
Toyota's manufacturing methods became synonymous with manufacturing efficiency, and many factories adopted what became known as the "Toyota way" or "Toyota method."
Today, Toyota is the one learning from rivals. The company is adopting techniques from Tesla. In China, it has teamed up with BYD in the hope of absorbing its electric motor and battery technology.
"The stage of the battle has changed," said Sanshiro Fukao, a senior research fellow at the Itochu Research Institute, and "the Japanese auto industry in particular has been very slow to act."
Toyota may no longer be able to take its time.
During the pandemic, the global automotive market passed a milestone that caught the world's major automakers flat-footed. In 2022, sales of electric vehicles surged nearly 70 percent to 7.7 million, surpassing those of hybrid-electric vehicles for the first time as demand skyrocketed in China, according to IDTechEx, a market research consultancy.
Toyota remains highly profitable, earning $ 8.9 billion in the quarter that ended on June 30. Last year, it sold 10.5 million vehicles, eight times as many as Tesla. But fewer than 1 percent of the cars it sold were fully electric vehicles.
The absence of electric vehicles has been especially costly in China, the world's largest car market. In July, Toyota's sales in China were down over 15 percent from a year earlier.
In the United States, Toyota's sales have increased, but less than other automakers. From June to August, the company's share of the passenger car market slipped to 13.8 percent from 15.1 percent a year earlier, according to the market research firm Cox Automotive.
The story is much the same for other Japanese automakers like Honda, Mazda and Subaru. Even Nissan, which began selling the Leaf electric car in 2010, has fallen behind, failing to produce a car that could rival Tesla's Model 3 in range, performance or design. Nissan accounted for less than 2 percent of the electric car market in the United States in the first half of the year. In China, it expects sales could drop by almost a quarter in the current fiscal year.
In May the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit organization, rated the 20 largest automakers on their progress toward zero emissions. Five of the six companies with the lowest scores were Japanese: Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda and Suzuki.
Foreign automakers in China produced electric models designed to placate regulators rather than appeal to consumers, said Christopher Richter, senior research analyst at CLSA, an investment firm.
"They didn't make them as great as they could, and they were behind the learning curve," he said.
Toyota has tacitly acknowledged that it has fallen far behind Tesla and BYD. The decision in January by the Toyota scion Akio Toyoda to step down as chief executive was widely seen as a recognition that the company needed new leadership to navigate the transformation of the auto industry.
The sense of urgency was compounded by the Shanghai auto show in April, said Tatsuya Otani, a journalist who has spent decades reporting on the Japanese auto industry.
Chinese vehicles at the show featured onboard controls and entertainment options that made them look more like iPhones on wheels than traditional cars. Japanese executives were stunned to see how much progress their Chinese rivals had made, Mr. Otani said.
Toyota declined to make executives available for interviews.
The only all-electric Toyota sold in the United States is the bZ4X, a sport utility vehicle that the company recalled last year because faulty bolts could cause the wheels to fall off -- an embarrassing misstep. In China, the company also offers an electric sedan, the BZ3. (Toyota's Lexus division sells one fully electric model in the United States and two in some countries.)
On returning from Shanghai, Toyota executives ordered employees to rush out a presentation on the company's plans for its electric vehicle production. Toyota shared the plan less than two weeks before the company's annual meeting, where shareholders, angered by the slow progress on battery-powered cars, proposed a resolution pushing the company to disclose its climate change lobbying.
The measure did not pass, but the rare expression of dissent was an indication of how Toyota, once praised as a paragon of clean tech, had fallen out of favor.
"They just are not moving quickly enough to E.V.s at a time when that is where the market and the planet are going," said Brad Lander, the comptroller of New York City, which owns more than $ 100 million in Toyota stock through its pension funds and backed the resolution.
The company has disputed that characterization, arguing that hybrid cars can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions more and faster than battery electric vehicles, which remain too expensive for many buyers.
Factoring in a cleaner manufacturing process for hybrid cars and the limited availability of critical battery materials, such as lithium, hybrids are a safer short-term bet, Toyota executives have said in recent public statements.
In Washington, the company has called for less stringent auto emission limits, saying in July that a proposed new standard "underestimates key challenges including the scarcity of minerals to make batteries, the fact that these minerals are not mined or refined in the U.S., the inadequate infrastructure and the high cost" of electric vehicles.
"When they do math, the effect on the environment is far greater for hybrids," said Jeffrey Liker, a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan and the author of several books on Toyota. "In addition to that, they make a whole lot more money."
Sales of all-electric vehicles are growing faster than hybrids. But some analysts predict that hybrid sales will surge as would-be electric vehicle buyers worry that the public charging network is inadequate and unreliable. If that happens, Toyota's strategy could be vindicated.
Anita Rajan, general director of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association in the United States, said Japanese automakers were biding their time until they could make electric cars that were as reliable and affordable as the gasoline vehicles.
"I don't know if there's a benefit in being first to market with these vehicles," Ms. Rajan said. "I think it's how you're entering the market and the thoughtfulness that you show for your customers."
In Toyota's home market, consumers have shown little appetite for battery electric cars, and the government has been reluctant to aggressively push for change in a profitable industry.
That could be a problem for Japanese carmakers, which have traditionally honed their technology at home before marketing it abroad, said Kazutoshi Tominaga, a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, which has worked with Japan's trade ministry to shape national electric vehicle policy.
"If Japan, as a market, doesn't shift to electrification, we don't have a place to test the product," he said.
Yet BYD has opened 10 dealerships in Japan and plans to have 100 by the end of 2025. The company went so far as to release a video in August calling on Chinese automakers to "demolish the old legends," widely interpreted as a reference to Japanese and Western automakers.
On a recent Sunday, prospective buyers waited patiently to take a BYD S.U.V. for a spin around the Tokyo neighborhood Ikebukuro. Salespeople were quick to point out the car's eligibility for thousands of dollars in subsidies from Japan's trade ministry, which has allocated $ 90 billion to promote battery electric cars.
Two nearby Toyota showrooms were largely empty.
Customers are "satisfied" with the current options, said Masaki Nagasawa, the deputy manager of a Toyota dealership in Tokyo. "For people who are wavering, subsidies are an incentive to buy," but most customers are anxious about electric cars' range and prefer hybrids, he said.
Toyota has said it is working on new production techniques and innovative battery technology that would increase its cars' range and reduce the time it takes to charge them. The company has said that its lineup will include 10 new all-electric vehicles by 2026 and that it will aim to sell 3.5 million of them annually by 2030.
Speaking on Wednesday in Tokyo after the unveiling of a new luxury plug-in hybrid vehicle, Simon Humphries, who is in charge of branding and design and is a director on Toyota's board, said the company was releasing new electric options "month by month, year by year."
But, he added, while there is an "urgency" to introduce new battery-powered cars, "there's urgency in every segment."
Electric vehicle companies are moving fast.
Tesla is on track to sell nearly two million electric cars this year and is building a factory in Mexico, where it is expected to make a car that sells for around $ 25,000. In the United States, the company's Model 3 sedan already sells for about as much as a comparably equipped Toyota Camry after federal and state incentives are taken into account.
BYD is rapidly expanding outside China, including in Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia. Its extensive electric lineup includes models that are cheaper than Toyota's most affordable sedans and a mammoth luxury S.U.V. that sells for around $ 150,000.
Just as Apple, Google and Samsung quickly displaced Nokia and BlackBerry in the mobile phone business, some analysts say, Tesla and BYD could be so far ahead in making electric cars by 2026 that Toyota might struggle to catch up.
But Japanese officials are more sanguine.
People own cars longer, so the transition will not be as fast as with cellphones, said Naoki Kobayashi, a deputy director of the trade ministry's automobile division.
He acknowledges that Toyota faces a big challenge, but, he added, "unlike with smartphones, we've still got time."

U.S. to Recall A Key Part For Airbags: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The action covers airbags made by two companies and used by 12 automakers from 2000 to 2018. The parts were linked to seven injuries and one death.
Federal auto safety regulators moved Tuesday toward a recall of about 52 million airbag inflaters used by a dozen major carmakers, calling the parts unsafe and susceptible to rupture.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration scheduled a public meeting on Oct. 5 on its recommendation to recall the airbags, manufactured by ARC Automotive and Delphi Automotive Systems. ARC rejected the agency's initial findings that its airbags were defective.
The agency said that at least seven people had been injured and one killed in seven incidents in the United States as a result of the defective airbags.
Of the 52 million airbags, 41 million were manufactured by ARC and 11 million were produced by Delphi using a design licensed by ARC. The airbags were variously made in China, Mexico and Knoxville, Tenn., and were used by a dozen major carmakers: BMW, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Stellantis, Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen.
"An airbag inflater that fails by rupture not only does not perform its job as a safety device, but instead actively threatens injury or death, even in a crash where the vehicle occupants would otherwise have been unharmed," the agency said in its announcement.
ARC and Delphi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The ARC matter comes several years after the safety agency's investigation of inflaters made by Takata, a Japanese supplier, that were found to explode violently and suddenly, even when the airbags were not deployed in a crash. In that case, regulators determined that Takata used a propellant that could break down over time from exposure to humidity.
The safety agency linked the Takata defect to more than a dozen deaths in the United States. More than 70 million vehicles equipped with Takata inflaters were recalled in more than 40 countries.
In April, the safety agency demanded in a letter to ARC that the company recall tens of millions of airbag inflaters that were made from 2000 to 2018.
The agency's investigators found that a small number of inflaters designed by ARC could explode more violently than intended when a vehicle's airbags are deployed, and therefore "pose an unreasonable risk of death or injury," the letter said.
The letter prompted G.M. to recall nearly one million vehicles made from 2014 to 2017 and equipped with ARC inflaters. The automaker said it was taking the action "out of an abundance of caution."
In response to the agency's demand, ARC declined to issue a recall and said in a letter in May that it did not believe a defect existed and that in its view NHTSA's finding was not based on "any objective technical or engineering conclusion."
Inflaters use an explosive substance such as ammonium nitrate that is compacted into tablets stored in a metal cylinder. In a crash severe enough to set off a vehicle's airbags, the tablets are supposed to create a controlled explosion that rapidly fills the airbags with gas.
The safety agency said it had found that ARC's manufacturing process could leave bits of welding material, known as weld slag, inside the cylinder. If the airbags are deployed, that material could clog the exit opening and cause an explosion violent enough to blast shards of metal and plastic into the vehicle's interior.
The agency has been looking at ARC inflaters since 2015. The most recent incident involving a rupture occurred in Michigan in March, when the driver of a 2017 Chevrolet Traverse sustained facial injuries.
ARC, in its letter to regulators in May, said that weld slag had been ruled out as the cause of two of the seven incidents noted by the agency, and that it had not yet been found definitively to be the cause of the other five.
A large-scale recall, and any related legal expenses, could have considerable costs for the inflater makers. After the Takata recall, the largest in automotive history, which forced it to pay millions of dollars in fines to U.S. regulators, the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and was sold to Joyson Safety Systems, formerly known as Key Safety Systems.
Takata had been responsible for the cost of replacing the defective inflaters -- a task handled by local car dealerships -- but the bankruptcy filing left automakers to pick up the bill. About 11 percent of the affected airbags still haven't been replaced, according to the safety agency's most recent estimate.
The agency has come under scrutiny for its investigations of vehicle defects. In May the Department of Transportation's inspector general issued a report concluding that the agency's Office of Defects Investigations did not identify and investigate safety defects in a timely manner.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Kohei Saito decided to write about "degrowth communism," his editor was understandably skeptical. Communism is unpopular in Japan. Economic growth is gospel.
So a book arguing that Japan should view its current condition of population decline and economic stagnation not as a crisis, but as an opportunity for Marxist reinvention, sounded like a tough sell.
But sell it has. Since its release in 2020, Mr. Saito's book "Capital in the Anthropocene" has sold more than 500,000 copies, exceeding his wildest imaginings. Mr. Saito, a philosophy professor at the University of Tokyo, appears regularly in Japanese media to discuss his ideas. His book has been translated into several languages, with an English edition to be issued early next year.
Mr. Saito has tapped into what he describes as a growing disillusionment in Japan with capitalism's ability to solve the problems people see around them, whether caring for the country's growing older population, stemming rising inequality or mitigating climate change.
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, has worked for years to promote economic growth in the shadow of an aging, shrinking population, with a monetary and fiscal policy that is among the most aggressive of any nation.
But there are strong indications that the country's growth-oriented policies of ultracheap money and big government spending are reaching their limits. The interventions have done little to stimulate growth in Japan's economy. And as government efforts to lift the birthrate also falter, with fewer people doing less work, "the room for growth is running out," Mr. Saito, 36, said during a recent interview at his Tokyo home.
That's seemingly true even when Japan's economy expands. When the country reported growth of 6 percent in the second quarter of this year, it was driven almost entirely by external factors: exports and inbound tourism. Domestic consumption, on the other hand, shrank.
The focus on growth was important when Japan was developing. But now that the country is wealthy, Mr. Saito said, the insistence on an endlessly expanding economy, described in terms of gross domestic product, or G.D.P., has produced obviously wasteful spending as the government has urged people to consume more.
Some areas of the economy, such as health care, will need to continue growing, but "there are too many cars, too many skyscrapers, too many convenience stores, too much fast fashion," he said. The focus on consumption, he argues, has had devastating consequences for the environment, driven widening inequality and wasted limited resources that could be put to better use.
Reorienting Japan toward goals that more effectively reflect the country's current needs, he says, would mean using metrics other than G.D.P. to gauge the country's economic well-being. The focus would shift from quantity to quality, on measures like health, education and standard of living.
Mr. Saito first encountered Marx in 2005, when he was an undergraduate at the University of Tokyo. In high school, Mr. Saito was "more right wing," he said, convinced that individual failings were the root cause of Japan's problems. When he encountered the German philosopher's arguments that structural causes led to inequality and war, it was "shocking," he said.
"After the economic crisis of 2008, there was a Marx renaissance in Japan, and I was convinced of the importance of his theory," Mr. Saito said.
He has spent the years since studying Marx's twilight years, when, Mr. Saito argues, the philosopher realized that capitalism, with its insatiable demand for growth, would inevitably lead to environmental disaster.
Mr. Saito conceived "Capital in the Anthropocene" -- a reference to an era in which human activity has a profound impact on the Earth's environment -- early in the Covid pandemic. Socialism was a hot topic in Europe and the United States, where politicians like Bernie Sanders urged Americans to grapple with the drawbacks of U.S.-style capitalism. The aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, rising inequality and the unavoidable realities of climate change were driving many young people to question the sustainability and fairness of existing economic systems.
People in Japan, too, felt dissatisfied with the status quo, Mr. Saito said. But unlike people in other parts of the world, "they aren't thinking, 'Capitalism is bad,' they're thinking, 'I'm bad.' They aren't thinking that capitalism needs to change, they're thinking, 'I need to change."'
He recognized the thinking as similar to his own in high school, when he believed that people merely needed to work harder or be more productive.
Mr. Saito's critics have called him out for castigating the capitalist system he himself has benefited from while providing little more than unworkable idealism and failed ideology as an alternative. His book has ignited a publishing boomlet on Marxism in Japan, with some works attacking his ideas and others supporting them.
The renewed discussion hasn't done much to revive the prospects of Japan's own Communist Party, however. Mr. Saito is not a fan of the group, which he sees as well-meaning but stale. He also does not have much patience for other more familiar strains of communism, such as that practiced by the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, with their emphasis on state power over industry and centralized planning.
He recognizes that growth remains crucial for improving quality of life in less developed countries. And even in rich nations, he does not call for people to give up their creature comforts. He recently moved into a three-story home in an upscale neighborhood on the outskirts of Tokyo and drives a compact Toyota. One of the few things he has given up, he said, is fast food.
Achieving degrowth communism, he believes, is less about personal choices and more about changing overarching political and economic structures. Marxism, he argues, offers a viable model for reorienting society around the maximization of public goods as opposed to the endless pursuit and concentration of wealth.
That would require, among other things, moving away from G.D.P. as the key measure of a country's health. As an alternative, he suggests the "human development index," an idea proposed by the Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq, which the United Nations has used as an alternative indicator of a country's progress.
The index -- which measures life expectancy, education and quality of life -- gives a more comprehensive view of how the economy affects people's lives than G.D.P.
Mr. Saito is not clear exactly what shape a world under degrowth communism would take, but he insists that it would be democratic and focused on expanding communal resources, reducing the wealth gap and removing incentives for excess consumption.
For his own part, he is participating in a handful of projects aimed at promoting those ideas. He and a group of supporters are purchasing land in the mountains west of Tokyo, which they plan to run as a collective to benefit the local community.
And for the last year, he has spent time on an organic farm outside Tokyo that has positioned itself less as a business and more as a community resource for urbanites to get healthy food and learn about agriculture.
The farm itself is, in one sense, a glimpse of a post-growth Japan where a shrinking population finds itself left with an abundance of resources. The fields are pieced together from properties that went fallow after their owners died or got too old to manage them.
It's the kind of scene that, Mr. Saito's critics argue, could be common across a Japan under degrowth policies.
But he has never really believed that society needs to return to some idyllic, agrarian lifestyle.
"I'm not saying let's go back to the Edo period," he said, referring to the feudal era when the country was largely closed to the rest of the world.
His vision for the future is one in which people -- less consumed by their endless pursuit of growth for growth's sake -- have the leisure time to spend a workday pursuing new interests, as he does with farming.
On a recent day, Mr. Saito spent several hours working alongside the organic farm's owners, Shoko Nakano and her husband, Sho Nakano. Local residents popped in to buy vegetables from a shack built out of recycled materials, while an enormous sow snuffled in the heather beside a vegetable garden.
After Mr. Saito spent a few hours driving bamboo stakes into a field with a heavy wooden mallet, Ms. Nakano asked him if he felt energized by his experience wielding a symbol of the proletariat.
Mr. Saito laughed. "I'm definitely bourgeois," he said.

Full text: Jennifer Lee and Dr. Sachin Jain bonded over commonalities in their upbringings. They also discovered, after separate car accidents, that they could count on each other.
While driving home from a work dinner in downtown Los Angeles in August 2021, Jennifer Lee's Toyota Prius was suddenly struck in the side by another car that had run a red light. Ms. Lee had suffered whiplash, her car was badly damaged and she was in a state of shock.
As the police and tow truck arrived, she called Dr. Sachin Jain, whom she had been dating for about three months.
"He was the first person who came to my mind," Ms. Lee said. And without hesitating, Dr. Jain left the dinner he was attending to drive 40 minutes so he could pick up Ms. Lee, bring her home, and take care of her.
"I was in my crisis mode, and he was the rational person saying don't worry, we'll get this figured out," Ms. Lee said.
That weekend, Dr. Jain devoted himself to helping Ms. Lee buy a new car. "I wanted to make sure she got a fair deal," he said. "That was a real bonding experience. We spent 48 hours together."
Several weeks later, at the end of September, Dr. Jain was crossing the street in Los Angeles on a walk signal when a distracted driver in a Toyota Prius ran into him. Dr. Jain flew onto the car, and rolled off its windshield. He suffered a concussion, and fractured one of his ribs and his tibial plateau, the flat portion of the bone that runs from the knee to the ankle.
At the time, Ms. Lee was driving on the freeway to pick up an embroidered jacket, a gift for Dr. Jain's upcoming birthday. "He called me and he wasn't making any sense," she said. "My heart sunk. Someone had to take the phone from him and say, 'He's been hit by a car.' It was so scary."
She turned around and drove straight to the scene of the accident, then followed the ambulance as it took Dr. Jain to the emergency room at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
"My closest family members were 3,000 miles away," Dr. Jain said. His immediate family members live on the East Coast. "But in many ways I felt like I had the comfort of family by my side when she was with me in that emergency room," he added. After being released the same day, Dr. Jain was in physical therapy for five months.
Dr. Jain and Ms. Lee first met at Alibi Room, a bar and restaurant in Los Angeles, in May 2021 after matching on Hinge. They connected over their shared love of Costco and the TV series "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit." They also discovered commonalities in their upbringings.
"We're from different cultures," Dr. Jain said. "But we both had these immigrant stories."
"It was like, 'What did you do on the weekends when you were young'," Ms. Lee said. "I drove to art class six hours away in San Diego."
"I went to Korean SAT classes every weekend," Dr. Jain answered.
Ms. Lee, 33, was born in Seoul. When she was about 3, her family moved to Irvine, Calif., because of her father's job with Kia Motors. In 2013, she received a bachelor's degree in fashion design and marketing from Central Saint Martins in London before relocating to Seoul in 2014 to work at Coupang, a Korean e-commerce company. In 2015, she moved back to Los Angeles, and in 2021, began her current job as a color and material designer at Skechers.
Dr. Jain, 42, grew up in different parts of Bergen county in New Jersey; his parents immigrated from Rajasthan, India, in the 1970s. He has a bachelor's degree in government from Harvard, an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, and a medical degree from Harvard Medical School.
In the middle of his residency at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, from 2009 to 2011, Dr. Jain took a leave to work in President Obama's administration in several roles related to health care reform. He completed the residency in 2012.
In 2014, he joined CareMore Health, a health plan and care delivery system for Medicare and Medicaid patients, as a chief medical officer. He became the chief executive of the company in 2016. Since July 2020, he has been the chief executive of SCAN Health Plan, a nonprofit organization focused on care of older adults.
After their first date, Ms. Lee and Dr. Jain continued seeing each other, but neither was ready to commit. "We wanted our next relationship to be a serious one so we decided we'd take our time to get to know each other," Ms. Lee said.
That summer, on a flight back from Houston, where they had gone for the weekend to visit one of Dr. Jain's friends, the two of them chatted the entire time. "We were talking like best friends talk," Dr. Jain said. "That was the first point it registered that it could be something more."

The day after Dr. Jain's accident, the couple went on a planned trip to Cancún, Mexico, where Ms. Lee surprised Dr. Jain with a Cameo video of the actor Mr. T wishing him a happy birthday and a strong recovery. "I was a huge fan of Mr. T as a kid," Dr. Jain said. "I loved 'Rocky III' and 'The A-Team.' The present was super sweet and thoughtful and kind of hilarious."
In February 2022, at his friend's wedding, Dr. Jain decided he was ready to fully immerse himself in the relationship, so he told Ms. Lee that he loved her. But she didn't say it back. He feared the relationship was over. "I thought maybe this is it," he said.
Ms. Lee had never told a partner "I love you" before. "I built it up in my head," she said. "If I say I love you, that means you're the person I want to marry." She had spoken to friends and to her older sister, Carol Kim, and they were convinced she did love Dr. Jain. But she was afraid to vocalize her feelings too hastily. "I wanted to be intentional about it," she said. Finally, some weeks later, she realized she was overthinking and reciprocated.
A little less than a year later, on Feb. 13, 2023, Ms. Lee and Dr. Jain were staying at the Westin Hapuna Beach Resort in Waimea, Hawaii, when Dr. Jain suggested they do a free photo shoot on the beach for their 2023 holiday card.
Ms. Lee thought it was odd to take photos 10 months in advance, but she agreed that it would be a fun activity.
As they posed for photos, Dr. Jain dropped to one knee. "My first instinct was like, 'Did you drop something? You're going to ruin your suit,"' Ms. Lee said. "Suddenly he got the box out. Time stopped. I blacked out." The diamond ring Dr. Jain presented was one he had chosen with the help of his brother Roopam Jain, a jeweler.
"It was amazing," Ms. Lee said. "And everyone says I'm really picky."
Afterward, they had dinner at Mauna Kea Beach Hotel and spent the evening calling their friends and family to tell them the news. "As soon as we announced we're getting married, everybody immediately started asking about the date of the wedding," Dr. Jain said. "They had been waiting 20-some-odd years for this news," he added, in reference to his family.
So Dr. Jain and Ms. Lee did not hesitate. During the next five months, with the help of eager family members and friends, they planned six days of wedding celebrations that combined influences from both of their cultures.
On July 28, they had a wedding ceremony in front of 400 people at the Rockleigh, an events space in Northern New Jersey.
The day before, on a Thursday, during a traditional Korean paebaek tea ceremony at the venue, the family's elders offered words of wisdom and blessings.
On Thursday evening, they held a sangeet, an Indian wedding tradition, during which friends and family can put on performances. "We had a choreographer work with all these different groups of people," Ms. Lee said. Her family members performed to "Gangnam Style," a popular 2012 Korean song by the musician Psy, and her friends danced to "It's Gonna Be Me" by 'N Sync.
Dr. Jain surprised Ms. Lee with a piano performance of "Home" by Michael Bublé, accompanied by his friend and his nephew on vocals. "The time everybody spent practicing was the beauty of it," Ms. Lee said. "The celebrations started before the actual ceremony."
On Friday, after the ceremony, there was a cocktail hour and an entirely vegetarian dinner prepared by chef Vipul Gupta from Moghul Catering that fused Korean and Indian food. A live band, Blue Avenue Groove, performed at the reception. The next day, Narpat Jain, one of Dr. Jain's brothers, and his wife, Archana Jain, hosted a lunch -- with a pizza truck and a dosa station -- during which the newlyweds played traditional Indian wedding games, like searching for a ring in a bowl filled with milk and flowers.
About two weeks later, on Aug. 12, Dr. Jain and Ms. Lee were legally married by their friend and neighbor, Kristen Byrdsong, a superior court judge, in her backyard in Playa del Rey, Los Angeles. "She came out in her judge's robe and wrote a speech," Dr. Jain said. "She and her husband popped Dom Pérignon for us."
"It's all been a complete blur," Dr. Jain said. "What we always wanted was our families to really come together as one. It was something we were anxious about, coming from two different cultures. But in the end, there was so much obvious connection and love."
On This Day
Where The Rockleigh, Rockleigh, N.J.
When July 28, 2023
Icy Treats Ms. Lee's family loves cold sweet treats, so the bride and groom provided Italian gelato, Indian kulfi and shaved ice, and American ice cream. "We made sure they had ice cream at every meal," Dr. Jain said.
Last-Minute Zoom About two weeks before the wedding, Dr. Jain's brother Roopam and his wife, Sapna Jain, sounded the alarm that Dr. Jain's parents, Dr. Subhash Jain and Sarla Jain, had never met Ms. Lee's parents, Dong Kyung Lee and Myung Hee Lee. A video call was quickly organized and the parents connected despite the language barrier -- one set speaks Hindi at home in Alpine, N.J., and the other set lives in Seoul and speaks primarily Korean.
Endless Looks During the course of their many days of celebration, the bride and groom each wore about 10 different outfits. One of them -- the most crucial one -- almost didn't make it to the wedding. Ms. Lee's lehenga (a set containing an embroidered red and gold skirt, a blouse and two shawl-like scarves) for the ceremony and reception, designed by the brand Sabyasachi, had to travel back and forth from India to New York City twice because the first time, a top she had not ordered was sent and the measurements were all wrong. But, Dr. Jain said, "in the end it was perfect."

U.A.W. and Big 3 Face Sizable Gap To Avoid a Strike: [National Desk]

Full text: With their contract expiring Sept. 14, the United Auto Workers and the companies are far apart in talks. A walkout could take a big economic toll.
The United Auto Workers union and the three Detroit automakers have less than two weeks to negotiate a new labor contract, and a strike of some sort seems increasingly likely.
The union's president, Shawn Fain, has primed rank-and-file members to be prepared to walk off the job if the union's long list of demands for improved wages and benefits are not met.
A strike against one of the companies, especially a prolonged stoppage, could send an economic jolt through several Midwestern states and crimp the profits of General Motors, Ford Motor or Stellantis. G.M. workers walked out for 40 days in 2019 before reaching an agreement.
A strike against all three -- a step the union has never taken but one Mr. Fain has said he is willing to call for this year -- could have a noticeable impact on the broader U.S. economy.
"If that happens, even a short strike would impact economies throughout Michigan and across the nation," said Patrick Anderson, the chief executive of the Anderson Economic Group in East Lansing, Mich.
The talks are playing out as automakers are spending tens of billions of dollars to transition to electric vehicles, which require fewer workers to assemble than traditional gasoline-powered cars and trucks. The terms of the new contract will determine how both autoworkers and the companies fare in an E.V.-centric industry.
At the same time, significant wage and benefit gains could provide a tailwind for a union movement that has been gaining strength across several industries.
There are political stakes as well. President Biden has declared that "the U.A.W. deserves a contract that sustains the middle class" and has named a White House liaison to the union and the automakers. But the U.A.W. has withheld an endorsement of his re-election bid so far, partly because of concern over the union's share of E.V.-related jobs created with federal subsidies.
An agreement before the contracts expire on Sept. 14 is still possible, and talks could continue beyond that date without a walkout. But Mr. Fain has repeatedly said he views Sept. 14 as a deadline -- the day a strike could begin. He was elected to the U.A.W. presidency last year as an insurgent, ousting the incumbent on a vow to take a more combative and confrontational approach in the talks than his recent predecessors.
"President Fain has declared war, and that usually means there's going to be a battle, and that battle would be a strike," said Sam Fiorani, the vice president of global vehicle forecasting at Auto Forecast Solutions, a market researcher. "The U.A.W. leadership is in a position now where they have to prove to the members that they are fighting for them, so it's pretty unlikely there won't be a strike."
The auto industry as a whole, including foreign-owned companies with operations in the United States, makes up about 3 percent of the country's gross domestic product. A 10-day strike against the three Detroit automakers would result in total wage losses of $ 859 million and manufacturers' losses of $ 989 million, according to estimates by Mr. Anderson's firm.
In August, Mr. Fain sent each company a list of demands, including higher wages, improved benefits, a resumption of regular cost-of-living wage bumps to ward off the impact of inflation and an end to a wage structure that leaves newer hires making a third less than veteran workers. Mr. Fain suggested as much as a 40 percent wage increase, noting that the chief executives of each of the companies had their compensation packages rise substantially in the last four years.
He also called for contract provisions that would require the automakers to pay workers to do community service if their plant closes, describing it as a way to deter the companies from shuttering factories and to protect towns and local economies from being ravaged by the loss of a major employer.
"The manufacturers can absolutely afford some of those demands, but the more they get, the less competitive the companies are going to be," Mr. Fiorani said.
In a video message streamed on Facebook on Thursday, however, Mr. Fain said the union and the automakers remained far apart. Ford, he said, offered wage increases and other provisions that were "insulting" to the U.A.W.
In a statement, Ford said it had offered a 9 percent wage increase and one-time lump-sum payments that, combined, would increase a worker's income by 15 percent over the four-year contract. Mr. Fain said lump-sum payments helped but did not improve a worker's income over a long period.
The U.A.W. and Ford are also at odds over profit-sharing bonuses, the use of temporary workers, cost-of-living wage increases, retiree health care and several other matters.
Mr. Fain said that G.M. and Stellantis had not provided counteroffers to the union's proposals, and that the U.A.W. had filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board contending that the two companies were not negotiating in good faith.
"I know this update is infuriating, and believe me when I say I'm fed up," he said. "Our goal is not to strike. Our goal is to bargain a fair contract, but if we have to strike to win economic and social justice, we will."
G.M. said it was "surprised by and strongly refutes" the charges in the N.L.R.B. complaint. "We have been hyper-focused on negotiating directly and in good faith with the U.A.W. and are making progress," Gerald Johnson, G.M.'s vice president of global manufacturing, said in a statement.
Stellantis was "disappointed to learn that Mr. Fain is more focused on filing frivolous legal charges than on actual bargaining," the company said in a statement. "We will vigorously defend this charge when the time comes, but right now, we are more focused on continuing to bargain in good faith for a new agreement."
In recent weeks, workers have organized several dozen rallies and other gatherings to prepare for picketing. "I think the membership is energized," said Christine Bostic, a battery tester at a G.M. electric vehicle plant in Detroit. "The facts are on our side. If it comes to a strike, I'm ready for that."
To soften the impact of a stoppage, the union has amassed a strike fund of $ 825 million. It plans to pay striking workers $ 500 a week and cover their health insurance premiums while they are out of work.
In recent days, Mr. Fain has joined the union's negotiating teams in their talks with each of the automakers, an unusual step. Normally, the U.A.W. president does not take a direct role until the final days or hours of negotiations.
On Wednesday, he took part in discussions with Stellantis, where tensions between the two sides have been high. When Stellantis responded to Mr. Fain's demands with a list of cost concessions it wanted from the union, Mr. Fain took to Facebook to denounce them, dropping the document into a wastebasket.
Decades ago, when the U.A.W. had more than a million members and the Big Three -- G.M., Ford and Chrysler, now part of Stellantis -- had almost no foreign competition, a strike by the union could shut down a significant portion of the United States economy.
Today, the union is much smaller. G.M., Ford and Stellantis employ about 150,000 U.A.W. workers, and those companies make only a little more than 40 percent of the cars and trucks sold in the U.S. market.
But the union entered this year's talks in a much stronger negotiating position than it had in years. In the past, the Detroit companies were struggling badly against foreign rivals that operate nonunion plants in the South, like Toyota and Honda, and had a significant cost advantage. In most of the last several contracts, G.M., Ford and Stellantis had to get concessions on wages and benefits to survive.
Over the last 10 years, however, all three companies have rung up record profits, thanks in part to the concessions they won from the union as well as the shift in consumer preferences to high-margin trucks and large sport utility vehicles.
In the first half of this year, Ford made $ 3.7 billion and G.M. made $ 5 billion. Stellantis reported profits of 11 billion euros (about $ 11.9 billion).
In the past, the U.A.W. has chosen one company -- it was G.M. four years ago -- as the "target" to focus on in the talks. Mr. Fain has said the union could target all three companies this time around, but many analysts think the union will eventually choose Stellantis. In addition to the strains between the company and the union, their talks involve a plant in Belvidere, Ill., that Stellantis has idled and that the union wants the company to reopen.
Getting Stellantis to reopen the plant is a critical task for Mr. Fain. Four years ago, G.M. closed a plant in Ohio and the U.A.W. failed in its efforts to push the company to reopen it. In his campaign for the presidency, Mr. Fain promised members that his tougher approach would prove successful this time.
The union could get a hand in this battle from the federal government. On Thursday, the Energy Department said it had made $ 2 billion in grants and $ 10 billion in loans available to auto companies to convert existing factories that build gasoline-powered cars and trucks into plants that produce hybrid and electric vehicles.
Stellantis, like G.M. and Ford, aims to introduce several more electric models over the next few years and will probably have to retool some plants to make them. It is already building a battery plant in Indiana for its E.V. push.
Mr. Fiorani suggested that Stellantis could decide to overhaul the Belvidere plant to make electric models. "Stellantis could find a product to go in there," he said. "For the U.A.W. to truly win something, though, it has to be electric vehicles that Stellantis would plan on making for several years."

Auto Strike Looms, Threatening to Shut Detroit’s Big 3

The United Auto Workers union and the three Detroit automakers have less than two weeks to negotiate a new labor contract, and a strike of some sort seems increasingly likely.
The union’s president, Shawn Fain, has primed rank-and-file members to be prepared to walk off the job if the union’s long list of demands for improved wages and benefits are not met.
A strike against one of the companies, especially a prolonged stoppage, could send an economic jolt through several Midwestern states and crimp the profits of General Motors, Ford Motor or Stellantis. GM workers walked out for 40 days in 2019 before reaching an agreement.
A strike against all three — a step the union has never taken but one Fain has said he is willing to call for this year — could have a noticeable impact on the broader U.S. economy.
“If that happens, even a short strike would impact economies throughout Michigan and across the nation,” said Patrick Anderson, the CEO of the Anderson Economic Group in East Lansing, Michigan.
The talks are playing out as automakers are spending tens of billions of dollars to transition to electric vehicles, which require fewer workers to assemble than traditional gasoline-powered cars and trucks. The terms of the new contract will determine how both autoworkers and the companies fare in an EV-centric industry.
At the same time, significant wage and benefit gains could provide a tail wind for a union movement that has been gaining strength across several industries.
There are political stakes as well. President Joe Biden has declared that “the UAW deserves a contract that sustains the middle class” and has named a White House liaison to the union and the automakers. But the UAW has withheld an endorsement of his reelection bid so far, partly because of concern over the union’s share of EV-related jobs created with federal subsidies.
An agreement before the contracts expire Sept. 14 is still possible, and talks could continue beyond that date without a walkout. But Fain has repeatedly said he views Sept. 14 as a deadline — the day a strike could begin. He was elected to the UAW presidency last year as an insurgent, ousting the incumbent on a vow to take a more combative and confrontational approach in the talks than his recent predecessors.
“President Fain has declared war, and that usually means there’s going to be a battle, and that battle would be a strike,” said Sam Fiorani, the vice president of global vehicle forecasting at Auto Forecast Solutions, a market researcher. “The UAW leadership is in a position now where they have to prove to the members that they are fighting for them, so it’s pretty unlikely there won’t be a strike.”
The auto industry as a whole, including foreign-owned companies with operations in the United States, makes up about 3% of the country’s gross domestic product. A 10-day strike against the three Detroit automakers would result in total wage losses of $859 million and manufacturers’ losses of $989 million, according to estimates by Anderson’s firm.
In August, Fain sent each company a list of demands, including higher wages, improved benefits, a resumption of regular cost-of-living wage bumps to ward off the impact of inflation and an end to a wage structure that leaves newer hires making one-third less than veteran workers. Fain suggested as much as a 40% wage increase, noting that the CEOs of each of the companies had their compensation packages rise substantially in the last four years.
He also called for contract provisions that would require the automakers to pay workers to do community service if their plant closes, describing it as a way to deter the companies from shuttering factories and to protect towns and local economies from being ravaged by the loss of a major employer.
“The manufacturers can absolutely afford some of those demands, but the more they get, the less competitive the companies are going to be,” Fiorani said.
In a video message streamed on Facebook on Thursday, however, Fain said the union and the automakers remained far apart. Ford, he said, offered wage increases and other provisions that were “insulting” to the UAW.
In a statement, Ford said it had offered a 9% wage increase and one-time lump-sum payments that, combined, would increase a worker’s income by 15% over the four-year contract. Fain said lump-sum payments helped but did not improve a worker’s income over a long period.
The UAW and Ford are also at odds over profit-sharing bonuses, the use of temporary workers, cost-of-living wage increases, retiree health care and several other matters.
Fain said that GM and Stellantis had not provided counteroffers to the union’s proposals and that the UAW had filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board contending that the two companies were not negotiating in good faith.
“I know this update is infuriating, and believe me when I say I’m fed up,” he said. “Our goal is not to strike. Our goal is to bargain a fair contract, but if we have to strike to win economic and social justice, we will.”
GM said it was “surprised by and strongly refutes” the charges in the NLRB complaint. “We have been hyper-focused on negotiating directly and in good faith with the U.A.W. and are making progress,” Gerald Johnson, GM’s vice president of global manufacturing, said in a statement.
Stellantis was “disappointed to learn that Mr. Fain is more focused on filing frivolous legal charges than on actual bargaining,” the company said in a statement. “We will vigorously defend this charge when the time comes, but right now, we are more focused on continuing to bargain in good faith for a new agreement.”

Decades ago, when the UAW had more than 1 million members and the Big Three — GM, Ford and Chrysler, now part of Stellantis — had almost no foreign competition, a strike by the union could shut down a significant portion of the U.S. economy.
Today, the union is much smaller. GM, Ford and Stellantis employ about 150,000 UAW workers, and those companies make only a little more than 40% of the cars and trucks sold in the U.S. market.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two years ago, as she walked through a hospital hallway in handcuffs and shackles to get tested for Covid, Sun Junli felt ashamed and defeated. At 45, she had come a long way. The poor village girl in northwestern China had become a successful businesswoman.
Then she was crushed.
In 2018, state-owned banks abruptly stopped lending to her business, a chain of cafe restaurants, and the pandemic destroyed her cash flow. By May 2021, Ms. Sun had lost her restaurants, and she was serving 16 days in detention for owing her employees about $ 28,000 in wages.
Weeks after her release, a court would seize her two-bedroom apartment in Xianyang in Shaanxi Province and her Toyota Camry because she was insolvent, and put her on a national blacklist. She can no longer book a hotel room or a plane ticket, or take out a loan.
"I'm surrounded by people like me," she said, counting dozens of friends in dire straits, entrepreneurs in fields like fashion, energy and furniture manufacturing. "We all came from nothing and worked hard to create wealth," Ms. Sun said. "We all lost everything and are deeply in debt."
"Are we all bad at what we do?" she asked. "Are we all wrong?"
A few years ago, Ms. Sun was the epitome of how small-business owners, through hard work, killer instinct and luck, became the backbone of the economy.
Now she illustrates something very different: how China, under the leadership of Xi Jinping, killed the animal spirits of the entrepreneur class as it asserted more state control of the economy. Mr. Xi's government has withdrawn help when business owners needed it the most, punished them for their risk-taking and failures, and made it nearly impossible for them to start over.
The Chinese authorities like to call small businesses the capillaries of the economy. But years of capricious government policies, crackdowns and blacklisting have left firms battered or destroyed.
In 2021, when China was heralding its success in fighting the pandemic, the number of small firms that shut their doors outnumbered those that opened, Zeng Xiangquan, a professor at Renmin University in Beijing, told an official newspaper.
Business confidence is still hurting, one reason that China is in an economic quagmire. Small businesses make up about 95 percent of China's private sector, which contributes about 50 percent of national tax revenue, 60 percent of economic output and 80 percent of new jobs.
Ms. Sun's career began in the 1990s. After dropping out of high school at 17 to support her family, she worked as a farmer, a textile worker, a street food vendor and a taxi driver. Then in Hancheng, a city of about 400,000 people near her village, she opened three sportswear stores that sold Nike, Adidas and the Chinese brand Anta. It was 2008, the year China held its first Olympic Games, a coming-out party for an emerging power. She would make what she called her "first bucket of gold."
In 2013, when e-commerce began to affect retail businesses, Ms. Sun opened Manny Coffee, a 4,000-square-foot cafe in Hancheng. It sold coffee, steak, pizza and other Western-style food and drinks, a novelty in the city. By 2018, she had expanded to 20 branches in six smaller cities in Shaanxi Province.
When she had started out years earlier, Chinese banks were reluctant to lend to the private sector. Around 2015, given competition from online financial institutions such as Ant Group, regulators instructed banks to lend more to small businesses.
Banks chased after Ms. Sun, who borrowed $ 1.3 million to expand and build a central production kitchen for her restaurants. But the credit dried up suddenly in 2018. The regulators, worried about debt, issued new guidelines telling banks to "pay attention to the quality of loans to small businesses."
The abrupt change bruised many companies. The fallout got so bad that regulators started to investigate the "irrational practices" of banks.
But it was too late for Ms. Sun. In October 2019, she borrowed money from family and friends to pay back her last bank loan, about $ 300,000. Her restaurants were doing well -- revenue reached $ 8 million in 2018. She was confident that the Chinese New Year in January 2020 would bring in healthy cash flows.
On the eve of the holiday, all her branches were shut as the coronavirus began to spread fast. The shutdown was lifted after three months, but her business never recovered. To pay rent and wages, Ms. Sun borrowed more from people close to her and maxed out her credit cards. Every month, she believed that the next month would be better. The government offered no help.
By November 2020, she was $ 1.5 million in debt and couldn't keep going. She shut the six restaurants she owned outright and gave up a 70 percent ownership she had in the 14 others, and in exchange her minority shareholders agreed to pay rent and wages.
China doesn't really allow for bankruptcy, which in other countries can allow business owners to work out the money they owe.
Ms. Sun owed six weeks of wages to her 31 employees. The employees reported her to the local labor inspection agency, which handed her to the police.
During her 16 days in the detention center, her hair went gray. She spent most time meditating. The police didn't release her until their investigation confirmed that she hadn't hidden any assets. A year later, the court would find "no criminal facts" against her, according to a court document. But she had lost her business and her reputation.
Ms. Sun tried to make a living by helping to manage the 12 Manny Coffee branches that were still in operation. But she had little work and income in 2022 because of China's draconian "zero Covid" measures. The apartment complex where she rents was locked down eight times. Her brother, who delivered meals, sometimes gave her money and brought her food.
Her father, who had lung cancer and had become infected with Covid, died on Dec. 25, 2022. It was her birthday. She turned 47.
Like many Chinese, Ms. Sun thought business would bounce back in 2023 after Covid restrictions were dropped. But it didn't.
To make a living, she is trying to start a new food business. In the economic downturn, she figures, her former customers might not want to pay $ 15 for steak, but they might buy a bowl of spicy vegetables for $ 4.
She said she didn't expect any financial support from the government. But she'd like to get off the blacklist she was added to in 2021.
The so-called dishonest persons list was started in July 2013, a few months after Mr. Xi took power. It had eight million people on it in March. Many business owners got swept onto the list, including the founders of at least 22 of the top 500 private enterprises in China, according to Chinese media reports.
"I'm not asking them to give me money," Ms. Sun said. "But I'd really like them to get my name off the blacklist so I can become a normal person and start a business again."
"I can't fly if I want to go to Shanghai," she said. "I can't take the high-speed train. I can't travel. In a way, it's no different from locking me down at home."

U.S. Steel Is Reviewing
Multiple Buyout Offers
U.S. Steel on Tuesday said it is in the process of reviewing offers for the storied company and symbol of American industrialization.
U.S. Steel rejected a $ 7.3 billion buyout proposal from a rival, Cleveland-Cliffs, two weeks ago, and that offer was followed by $ 7.8 billion bid from the industrial conglomerate Esmark.
Shares of the Pittsburgh steel maker soared more than 30 percent on speculation that a deal was imminent, and climbed another 3 percent on Tuesday.
In a letter to shareholders Tuesday, U.S. Steel said it was beginning to share due diligence information with potential buyers.
Soaring prices have helped fuel consolidation in the steel industry this decade.
Steel prices more than quadrupled near the start of the pandemic to near $ 2,000 per metric ton by the summer of 2021 as supply chains experienced gridlock, a symptom of surging demand for goods and the lack of anticipation of that demand.

Best Buy Shares Fall
As Shoppers Pull Back
Sales and profits at Best Buy slid in the second quarter as the nation's largest consumer electronics chain continued to wrestle with a drop in spending after Americans splurged during the pandemic.
The decline in sales was smaller than what Wall Street had anticipated, however, and profits were better than expected, and shares rose 3.9 percent on Tuesday.
The U.S. job market has remained resilient, but Americans are facing higher prices and more expensive credit. Retailers including Best Buy are also now bracing for the ending of the student loan moratorium, which had provided one-time college students a little more financial breathing room.
Comparable sales -- sales from physical stores open at least a year, and digital channels -- fell 6.3 percent.
Best Buy earned $ 274 million, or $ 1.25 per share, during the quarter ended July 29. That easily topped the per-share earnings of $ 1.06 that Wall Street was expecting, but was below the $ 306 million the company earned in the same period last year.

Toyota to Restart Plants
In Japan After Breakdown
Toyota will restart operations at its assembly plants in Japan on Wednesday, after a production system malfunction brought domestic output to a halt on Tuesday at the world's biggest-selling automaker.
The company continued to investigate the cause of the glitch, which it said was not because of a cyberattack and prevented it from ordering components.
The 14 plants together account for about a third of the automaker's global production, Reuters calculations showed.
Toyota's domestic production had been on the rebound after a series of output cuts it blamed on semiconductor shortages. Output was up 29 percent in January-June, the first increase in two years. Its Japan output averaged about 13,500 vehicles daily, Reuters calculations showed, excluding the group automakers Daihatsu and Hino.
Analysts said Toyota could be tested in making up for output lost during the outage, such as by running extra shifts. REUTERS

Natura, of Brazil,
Weighs Body Shop Sale
The Brazilian cosmetics maker Natura & Company said on Monday that its board of directors had authorized the company to search for "strategic alternatives" for the Body Shop, one of its subsidiaries, including a potential sale of the business.
In April, Natura agreed to sell its luxury brand Aesop to L'Oreal at an enterprise value of $ 2.53 billion. A sale of the Body Shop -- valued at about $ 511 million -- is the most likely outcome, analysts at J.P. Morgan wrote, because of the Aesop divestment and Natura's high focus on Latin America.
Natura rapidly grew through high-profile acquisitions in previous years, including the purchase of the Body Shop from L'Oreal in 2017.
However, it has struggled with profitability since, posting six consecutive quarters of losses.
Now, the company has been looking for "discipline" and deleveraging in a bid to bring back profitability. REUTERS

Vinfast Shares Soar
After a Mighty Debut
Shares of the Vietnamese electric-vehicle maker VinFast surged nearly 20 percent on Monday, extending a rally from last week that more than quadrupled its market value.
The company made a blowout debut on Wall Street this month, and its valuation of $ 190 billion makes it the third-most valuable automaker, behind Tesla and Toyota. But VinFast's small amount of publicly available shares has made the stock prone to volatility.
VinFast is almost entirely controlled by Pham Nhat Vuong, Vietnam's richest man and founder of the parent conglomerate Vingroup, with a stake of about 99.7 percent, according to a filing.
Despite the market enthusiasm, only 137 VinFast E.V.s were registered in the United States through June, according to S&P Global Mobility.
To drive sales, VinFast is breaking away from the direct-to-consumer approach used by Tesla and turning to dealers. The company is also building a $ 4 billion factory in North Carolina. REUTERS
INTERNATIONAL
BYD Automaker to Buy
A China Unit of Jabil
The Chinese automaker BYD said on Monday that its electronics unit had struck a deal to buy U.S.-based Jabil's mobile electronics manufacturing business in China for $ 2.2 billion.
The deal will expand BYD Electronic's customer base, product portfolio and smartphone components business as it looks to capture Jabil's potential growth.
Although now best known for its electric vehicles, BYD started out by selling electronic components. In 2007, it listed BYD Electronic, known as BE, on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
BE's major business has been selling electronic components for consumer electronics products such as smartphones and laptops. This was one of three key business segments for BYD Electronic, accounting for more than 70 percent of its total revenue in 2022.
Citi analysts said in a note that they believed the deal involved Jabil's Green Point metal casing operations in Wuxi. REUTERS

The Humblest of Chairs Quickly Becomes a Symbol: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It figured prominently in viral footage of a brawl, where it was used as a blunt instrument. So why is the humble folding chair now turning up on T-shirts, earrings and at least one tattoo?
Within hours of a fight breaking out on an Alabama riverfront this month, images and video clips from the brawl began to ricochet online. Then came the memes. After that, it wasn't long until the merchandise started to appear.
On Aug. 5, a group of white boaters attacked Dameion Pickett, a Black riverboat captain, after he instructed them to dock their pontoon elsewhere as the space was reserved for a larger vessel. A group of mostly Black bystanders rushed to his defense. In the aftermath of the brawl, a white folding chair -- an unlikely weapon that one man was seen wielding over his head during the encounter -- has emerged as a joking-but-not-really symbol of resistance against perceived racial aggression.
On TikTok, #boatfight and #montgomerybrawl videos have racked up tens of millions of views. Listings have flourished by the dozens on retailers like Redbubble, Etsy and eBay. Earrings, necklaces, mugs, T-shirts and window decals have all been fashioned in the image of the folding chair in recent weeks.
By Aug. 10, four people wanted in connection with the brawl had turned themselves in to the Montgomery Police Department. Reggie Ray, the man accused of using the chair in the altercation, has also been charged with disorderly conduct.
Since then, there has been a growing market for all things folding chairs. At least two online auctions advertising what was allegedly the white chair actually used in the brawl, one of which was listed for $ 35,000, abruptly ended "because there was an error in the listing," according to eBay.
For Tamika Hicks of Louisburg, N.C., however, the chair represented much more than a cash grab. Ms. Hicks, 38, a full-time health care worker who runs an Etsy handicraft shop on the side, said that she had fallen into this unusual cottage industry by accident, having originally made a pair of folding chair earrings for a friend after seeing the brawl online. After a robust response to her Facebook post showing off the earrings, she saw an opportunity to generate more income. She said she had received close to 1,000 orders this month.
"People just don't understand the power of social media," Ms. Hicks said. "Something that went viral has brought in other forms of income for me as a single mom. I'm also able to be a part of this conversation and to continue it."
Jasmine Green, a visual artist in Pittsburgh, moved quickly to capitalize on the moment. On her website, she is selling chair earrings of her own design that have the words "Try Me" carved into the center of the seat. She said she planned to send some of the profits after expenses to a fund set up for those who came to Mr. Pickett's defense, including Mr. Ray.
"Part of the celebration of this chair has been this idea of collective care," said Ms. Green, who is also the director of education at the nonprofit 1Hood Media Academy, which provides art, education and social justice programing to communities of color. "But I also want to remind people to make sure that we're also following up on those that were involved in the fight, if they need resources."
Uju Anya, an associate professor in Carnegie Mellon's department of modern languages, was given a pair of Ms. Green's "Try Me" earrings by her girlfriend and wore them to a Pittsburgh Steelers game, where she said they were complimented by strangers. To her, the earrings are more than just a comedic fashion trend.
"It's empowering and a collective sigh of relief," Professor Anya said.
Professor Anya suggested that the humor behind the white folding chair had a potency for one particular audience. "Anybody can generally understand a meme or TikTok," she said, "but the imagery of this chair is specific to us and has language very specific to Black people and Black culture."
Kaylen Sanders, a bank teller and a musician in Dallas, said he found himself deeply moved by the videos he saw online. "The fact that this didn't turn into something where guns came out, or anybody actually died or anything, it felt very relieving," Mr. Sanders said in an interview. He added that it was encouraging to watch other Black people come "to defend one Black man that very much could have been another cause."
"For me," he said, "it represented Black unity."
Instead of simply showing his support by buying a T-shirt or a cap, he decided to immortalized it on his skin: A new tattoo on his left arm reads "Montgomery, Alabama" along with the date "Aug. 5, 2023." A detailed line drawing of the folding chair is centered in the middle.
After a conversation with his fiancée, Camry Moss, the two landed on the idea for the tattoo. Two days after the brawl, he and Ms. Moss, who is a tattoo artist, sat down to commit the day to ink at his mother's house.
"I don't regret it, and it's not a joke," Mr. Sanders said. "I don't think over the years I'll be like, 'Oh, why did I do this?"'
According to Ravi Dhar, a behavioral scientist at the Yale School of Management who specializes in consumer behavior and branding, any emotionally charged moment that fuses race and anxiety is bound to cause people to "feel connected."
"The unique thing here, too, was the location," Professor Dhar said. The brawl, which erupted in Montgomery's popular Riverfront Park, occurred at the same dock where enslaved Africans once arrived by steamboat to be sold in the center of town. (Although the fight appeared to break out along racial lines, the Montgomery police have said they do not plan to pursue hate crime charges.)
"It signals that not much has changed," he added, "but this chair seems to have offered a different perspective."
Professor Dhar compared the unlikely imagery of the folding chair to other moments in history that can be evoked with a single image or item: Colin Kaepernick taking a knee during the national anthem as a statement on police brutality, for instance, or the red hats of a Trump rally. In its visceral connection to the actual events themselves, the chair also conjures up memories of the umbrellas used by pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong to shield themselves from tear gas and pepper spray during the movement's 2014 street protests.
"This white chair is not something that's inherently violent," said Ms. Green, the artist, "which I think has allowed people to have this feeling of humor around it. But it's this unassuming object that plays such a vital role."

Trapped in Spiral of Deflation, Chinese Surrender to Despair: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Consumers and business owners say they feel paralyzed by despair, and their reluctance to spend and borrow is feeding what could become a dangerous cycle.
When their government abruptly ended its harsh Covid measures in December, many Chinese expected a robust rebound from pent-up demand. Eight months later, China is instead facing an accumulation of bad news: record youth unemployment, a deep housing slump, stagnant spending, even deflation.
That's a shock to many Chinese who are used to an economy that kept on expanding and living standards that rose with it. Now they're contending with slowing businesses and shrinking personal fortunes.
I talked to over a dozen business owners and consumers, as I have been doing for years, and I can report: Their confidence in the future of the economy and the country is at a nadir. If they had hoped for a rebound, that hope has been extinguished. They worry that it's the beginning of something they don't dare to imagine and fear that the government doesn't have solutions. The bad news just keeps coming.
"The most terrifying thing is that everyone around me is at a loss of what to do next," said Richard Li, the owner of an auto parts wholesale business. "I used to believe that our country would become better and better."
In the first half of 2023, the revenue of Mr. Li's business fell 15 percent from a year earlier, when the city he lives in -- with more than 10 million other people -- was locked down for weeks.
He discovered that other companies like his were struggling, too. Some of his clients, auto repair shops, even shut their doors because car owners were reducing spending.
Mr. Li had four stores and closed two of them. He let go two-thirds of his employees and stopped investing in new products. He also cut back on dining out and hanging out with his buddies. Strapped for cash, he tried to sell an apartment he bought in 2020 as an investment. But there have been few queries, even after he cut the price to $ 400,000 from $ 500,000.
It's getting harder for people like Mr. Li to rely on the Chinese government to know what's going on in the economy. Data that it had released for years have been held back. Last week, it stopped sharing the unemployment rate for young people after the data hit a high at 21.3 percent in June.
But a set of official data the government was willing to share about July was bad enough.
Consumer prices in China fell last month for the first time in more than two years. Chinese banks extended $ 47.5 billion of new renminbi loans, tumbling 89 percent from June -- and half the amount of a year earlier. Housing sales in terms of footage fell 6.5 percent in the first seven months of the year, after shrinking by nearly a quarter last year. In a country where three-fifths of the household assets are tied up in real estate, that decline is alarming.
The anxiety is running so high that people are using a social media site called Xiaohongshu to post talismans they think could help them sell houses.
China slipped into deflation after the government's draconian "zero Covid" policy drastically suppressed consumption and business activity last year. Chenggang Xu, an economist at Stanford University, explained why deflation could be pernicious.
"The best scenario is that everyone expects prices will keep decreasing, so they will keep waiting for the prices to fall further," he said. "The worst scenario is that people are very scared and very anxious." Fear about their jobs or the survival of their businesses, he said, will cause them to save more and spend less, pushing the economy further into the trap of deflation.
With anxiety running high, people are already saving more and spending less.
Cob Liu, founder of an education start-up in a big city in southwestern China, said his revenue had remained flat this year, which is bad for a company that used to grow 40 percent a year. Mr. Liu, in his mid-30s, has about $ 1.5 million in cash but is determined to keep his monthly spending around $ 800, half of which goes to rent.
He will keep his five-year-old Toyota Corolla and not buy property anytime soon. He bought apartments in two complexes in 2019, and the developers of both stopped building after running out of money. That is a nightmare that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Chinese have been going through since the housing boom came to a sudden end.
Mr. Liu believes that the decline in the Chinese economy could drag on for years. He sold all his positions in mainland China stocks this year and said he would not touch shares of any Chinese companies, even if they were traded in New York or Hong Kong.
Boris Dai, 44, is a commercial real estate consultant in Beijing who earned less than $ 15,000 in the first six months of this year. That is half of what he made during the pandemic and less than 15 percent of his previous earnings. His other source of income -- an office space he rents out -- evaporated after his tenant went out of business six months ago.
"I can only lie flat," Mr. Dai said, using a phrase that describes taking a break from relentless work. "I have no expectations for the future." He converted his sport utility vehicle into a sleeper vehicle so he and his wife can save on hotels when they travel.
Even entrepreneurs who are doing well are reluctant to take out loans because of their uncertain prospects.
Mark Fu, founder of a financial advisory firm with offices in Chengdu and Hong Kong, said his business had been booming this year. Many wealthy Chinese, he explained, realized during the pandemic that money couldn't buy them safety or dignity and have sought his help to move their financial assets outside China. Banks offered him business loans at low interest rates, but he's reluctant to take on debt. Instead of expanding, he has reduced his staff to 10 employees from 12 through attrition.
He said he was horrified by the government's clampdowns on one industry after another during the pandemic. He said he used to believe that if he worked hard, he would succeed. Now he fears that how he runs his business isn't what matters most.
"Is the government going to wipe you all out in one go?" he asked, "or let you make some money?" He also has an apartment he has been unable to sell.
The mood on social media has become so bleak that a commentary in Securities Daily, an official publication, called for the suppression of posts that speculate about troubles ahead. Rumormongering had set off market fluctuations, the article said, quoting headlines such as "China's version of Lehman Brothers is coming!" and "A brokerage firm to hold a conference call of 'the darkest hour."'
People despair because they can't picture how China can get out of its downward spiral. The root of the troubles, they believe, is the ideology of Xi Jinping, China's paramount leader, who seems to dislike the private sector and has dismantled elements of the market economy that made China an economic success.
At 35, Andy Wang quit his job at a bank this year to prepare to apply for graduate school in Australia. He was put off last fall when a slate of new party leaders was announced, all protégés of Mr. Xi. "The corrective ability of this country was lost after that," he said.
His parents are wealthy, but he's pessimistic he will have the same opportunities they once enjoyed. "I can't see any way to make money in this country," he said. "I'm not even sure if I can maintain my current living standard. I could only strive for survival."

When their government abruptly ended its harsh COVID-19 measures in December, many Chinese expected a robust rebound from pent-up demand. Eight months later, China is instead facing an accumulation of bad news: record youth unemployment, a deep housing slump, stagnant spending, even deflation.
That’s a shock to many Chinese who are used to an economy that kept on expanding and living standards that rose with it. Now they’re contending with slowing businesses and shrinking personal fortunes.
I talked to more than a dozen business owners and consumers, as I have been doing for years, and I can report: Their confidence in the future of the economy and the country is at a nadir.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Resistance to wind and solar projects, even from some environmentalists, is among an array of impediments to widespread conversion to renewables.
If there is anywhere in the country primed to welcome the clean energy transition, it is Penobscot Bay in Maine. Electricity prices there are high and volatile. The ocean waters are warming fast, threatening the lobster fishery. Miles offshore, winds blow strong enough to heat every home and power every car in the state.
For more than 15 years, researchers at the University of Maine have been honing scale models of floating wind turbines inspired by oil rigs. They are now confident they can mass-produce turbine blades the length of football fields and float them miles into the ocean. It is the kind of breakthrough in clean energy technology that is allowing a much faster transition to renewables than many believed possible, aided by state officials eager to pioneer a floating wind industry.
One key to harnessing that wind lies at the end of a causeway jutting into the bay, on a mostly undeveloped island where eagles fish offshore and people walk in the quiet shade. Many officials see this spot, known as Sears Island, as the ideal site to build and launch a flotilla of turbines that could significantly lessen Maine's reliance on fossil fuels.
Standing in their way are environmental groups and local residents, all of whom are committed to a clean energy future and worried about the rapid warming of the earth. Still, they want the state to pick a different site for its so-called wind port, citing the tranquillity of Sears Island and its popularity and accessibility as a recreation destination.
On a recent summer morning one conservationist against the plan, Scott Dickerson, sat on a picnic bench and predicted environmental groups would sue to thwart development of the island, as they had many times in the past.
"And that, as you can imagine, is going to run the clock," he said, costing the state valuable time that could be saved by looking elsewhere.
After years of fits and starts, the transition to renewable energy like wind and solar power is finally shifting into full gear in many parts of the world, including the United States, which has been buoyed by massive new subsidies from the Biden administration. But around the country, the effort is being slowed by a host of logistical, political and economic challenges.
Breaks in supply chains have stalled big projects. Historically low unemployment makes it hard to hire workers to build or install new turbines or solar panels. Shortcomings in the power grid can block newly generated electricity from reaching customers. Federal, state and local regulations, including often byzantine permitting requirements, threaten to delay some construction for years. So do the court battles that almost inevitably follow those permitting decisions.
These problems are not unique to the United States. In Europe, orders for new turbines dropped unexpectedly last year as developers struggled with inflation and sluggish permitting. In parts of China, a growing fraction of electricity from turbines and solar panels is being wasted because the grid lacks capacity. In Australia, clean energy companies have complained about a shortage of skilled workers.
At the same time, it tends to take longer to build solar arrays, wind farms, car chargers and transmission lines in the United States than in China, India and Europe, a recent analysis by the International Energy Agency found.
But no hurdle to a clean energy transition at the speed and scale scientists say is needed to avert catastrophic warming is easier to see than the growing local backlash to large-scale wind and solar projects, like the one roiling Sears Island.
The problem boils down to this: If lawmakers want to ramp up renewables as fast and cheaply as possible, they'll need to bulldoze or build over some places that people treasure.
From the desert suburbs outside Los Angeles to the rolling hills along the Ohio River to the Jersey Shore, residents are crying out against solar farms, wind turbines and new power lines. They are suing, passing laws and taking other steps to stop or slow projects, some of which would power the nation's largest towns and cities with renewables.
"Decisions that are not meant to be personal -- they're being experienced on a very personal level," said Alison Bates, an environmental studies professor at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, who is studying ways to communicate with residents about offshore wind proposals.
Many opponents of renewable energy, she added, "are worried about the impacts to their very way of life."
While Americans broadly support renewable energy, polls show, they are less enthusiastic about having it in their backyard. One survey from 2021 found that only 24 percent of Americans were willing to live within a mile of a solar farm; the number dropped to 17 percent for wind farms.
Such resistance is often rooted in anxieties about broader social and economic change in communities where families have lived for generations. But in some cases, like lawsuits trying to stop wind farm development off Massachusetts, groups with funding from fossil fuel interests have stoked fear. Those efforts are their own sort of obstacle to renewables: an attempt by incumbent energy players to protect their market share, even if the economics have turned against them.
Another barrier is determined opposition by many top Republicans, including congressional leaders and their presidential front-runner. They have consistently tried to expand fossil fuel production and block efforts to promote renewables, and they have vowed to overturn President Biden's climate agenda if they regain full control of Congress and the White House. While some leaders in conservative states have welcomed development of renewables, others have passed laws making it easier for local communities to fight them.
A study this spring from Columbia University's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law found a 35 percent increase last year in local ordinances restricting renewable energy development, as well as a nearly 40 percent rise in wind or solar projects facing "serious organized opposition." If such restrictions became widespread, another recent study found, they could block up to 270 gigawatts of new onshore wind power over the next three decades, which is roughly twice the amount installed nationwide today.
'A Critical Technology'
Accelerating a clean energy future takes much more than technological advancement. It requires building a new arm of the economy: an assembly line that starts with raw materials and ends with a fleet of panels to soak up the sun or towering turbines to lasso the wind, wired into homes and businesses.
Every stop on that assembly line presents risks that could delay or derail new projects.
Maine's offshore wind push has been hastened by energy shocks. In 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent natural gas and home heating rates soaring. Because fossil fuel prices largely dictate energy costs in the Northeast, residential electricity prices for most Maine residents have nearly doubled in recent years.
Onshore wind and solar power have helped reduce electric costs, but the state cannot feasibly reach its renewables goals -- and less expensive energy bills -- without offshore generation. That's particularly true because wind blows strongest offshore in the coldest months, when demand for heat is at its highest.
"We see offshore wind as a critical technology," said Dan Burgess, the director of the Maine Governor's Energy Office.
Environmental groups, labor unions, some business leaders and a bipartisan coalition of state lawmakers locked arms this year to approve incentives and guarantees to help speed the development of Maine's offshore wind industry, which could create thousands of skilled jobs in the state.
Those have helped propel Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, as her administration tries to install three gigawatts of offshore wind power -- enough to power about 750,000 homes -- in the Gulf of Maine by 2040. The turbines will be far out enough to avoid the state's prime lobster fishing grounds and mostly disappear from view.
The climate bill that Mr. Biden signed last year provided hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks and grants to help make a wide variety of low-carbon technologies -- such as solar panels, wind turbines, nuclear reactors or batteries -- ultimately cheaper than fossil fuels.
A recent analysis found that it would cost less for electric utilities to build new wind and solar farms than to operate most of the existing coal-fired power plants -- a stunning shift from 15 years ago, when burning coal was the cheapest way to make electricity.
But after years of rapid growth, installations of wind, solar and batteries slowed by 15 percent last year, according to the American Clean Power Association, a trade group.
"There's a lot of capital ready to flow," said Gregory Wetstone, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, another trade group. "But to get these projects going, you need to get them permitted, you need to get them connected to the grid, you need workers, you need access to supply chains. All of that can still be quite difficult."
'Too Much Optimism'
In Maine, many of those challenges are concentrated at one choke point: where to put a new wind port, which state officials have not decided on.
Offshore turbines need a large slab of land where they can be built and launched to sea. That site must connect to highways, to truck in materials, but also sit beside deep water.
The state's two main contenders are in Searsport, about 30 miles south of Bangor.
One site is an industrial area, Mack Point, clearly visible from Sears Island. It is the spot many locals and conservationists prefer. The company that owns it says it could be easily converted to build and ship offshore turbines.
But some officials have warned that it could be difficult for Mack Point to secure needed permits from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies in order to dredge the bay and build new port facilities.
"I don't know if it can be permitted on Mack Point," said James Gillway, the town manager of Searsport.
Across the country, clean energy projects of all types are tied up in lengthy permitting processes. For offshore wind, it can take up to 10 years to secure approval before construction can begin. Elsewhere, many nuclear power companies are seeking to develop a new generation of smaller, safer reactors, but outdated regulations could make approval difficult, experts warn. Some solar developers are wary of building on federally owned land in the West because permitting can be so onerous.
Some environmentalists say that these stringent reviews are crucial for protecting fragile ecosystems or public health -- and that such regulations have been useful for blocking fossil fuel projects in the past. Yet others concerned about climate change say the balance has tipped too far toward paralysis.
Permitting has proved especially difficult for the nation's antiquated and fragmented electric grid. The United States has some of the best renewable energy resources in the world, including gusty winds in the Great Plains and scorching sun in the Southwest. But to tap those resources, which are often far from population centers, developers will need to build thousands of miles of new high-voltage transmission lines.
Yet building long-distance power lines can be a brutal slog. Reviews and permitting alone can take a decade or longer, and any state or county in the path of the lines can throw up roadblocks. Since 2000, the United States has barely built any major transmission lines that connect different regions of the country.
The 17-year journey of a wind farm project in New Mexico helps explain why. Initially proposed in 2006, the SunZia project entailed building a vast wind farm in New Mexico along with a 550-mile power line to deliver electricity to Arizona and California. This spring, after years of legal battles and route changes, SunZia received its final federal permit. It is now expected to be completed by 2026.
"I don't know if there's a single major transmission project out there that's been done in less than a decade," Hunter Armistead, the chief executive of Pattern Energy, which is developing the project, said at a recent conference. He later added, "There's too much optimism in how fast people think this is actually going to happen, and I think that's dangerous."
Projects that manage to secure permits still need materials and workers, both of which are scarce.
B.C. Broussard, the chief technology officer at Intertie, a California-based company that builds and installs microgrids for commercial energy storage, said that a shortfall of semiconductors last year slowed production for the firm and its competitors. He said the industry was now dealing with a roughly six-month wait for components like panel boards, disconnect switches and combiners. In addition, energy storage companies like his have been competing with electric vehicle makers for batteries and cells.
"There's not enough to go around," he said.
Supply chains are being further stretched by an effort to reduce America's dependence on China, which now pumps out the vast majority of the world's solar panels, battery minerals and wind turbines.
Hiring woes have compounded the problem. In recent years, ReVision Energy, which installs solar panels and heat pumps across the Northeast, has started training dozens of new workers in house, offering apprenticeships and helping employees get their electrician licenses.
But it still can't find enough skilled electricians to keep up with soaring demand: The wait time for installing new rooftop solar panels has risen from around three months to around 10 in some areas, said Vaughan Woodruff, ReVision's vice president of work force development.
Perhaps more than anything else, the question of where to place large new developments looms over the clean energy economy.
In the past, traditional coal, gas and nuclear plants could be built close to cities, taking up relatively little land. Energy infrastructure, like power plants, was often dropped into low-income areas and communities of color. People who were already marginalized disproportionately suffered from pollution, reduced home values and other costs linked to that infrastructure.
Wind and solar farms need far more space -- typically thousands of acres -- to produce the same amount of power. They are more likely to be located in rural or coastal areas, putting new communities face to face with energy infrastructure for the first time, and unhappily so.
In California, sunny San Bernardino County recently barred any new solar projects that don't serve local needs from occupying more than a million acres of land. In Kansas, where wind generates nearly half the state's power, at least 20 counties have restricted or banned new projects.
State officials in Ohio passed a law that allows county commissioners to block large-scale wind and solar projects but not fossil fuel drilling. Opponents of one solar plan in Ohio barraged state officials with complaints about falling property values and dark plots linked to China; they said anyone looking to lease their land to solar companies could no longer call themselves "farmers."
Many of those objections are rooted in online misinformation, often promoted by longtime critics of renewable products who are sometimes linked to the fossil fuel industry. But in interviews, some opponents of the Ohio solar farm expressed a much simpler rationale: They saw only downsides and nothing in it for them.
Opposition is also rising in urban areas and liberal states, where concerns about climate change run high. In Atlantic City, N.J., groups have protested and sued to stop federal approval of as many as 98 turbines in close offshore waters. They cite hits to tourism and claim damage to whales, with no firm scientific evidence behind them -- but with the encouragement of some conservative media figures like Tucker Carlson.
In New York, efforts to install public electric vehicle chargers have run into intense opposition from groups that want to radically reduce traffic and see the technology as a way to extend the hegemony of the automobile.
As a result, Manhattan has only seven fast chargers, according to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, and five of those are open only to Teslas.
Biden aides say they are confident the benefits of the projects will win over those opposed to having them near their backyard.
"There are a lot of creative ways to site clean energy," Ali Zaidi, the White House national climate adviser, said in an interview. He added, "The economics are powerful and ultimately will prevail."
'It Saddens Me'
In Searsport, many residents fear that state officials will bypass Mack Point, which sits on private land and would need to be leased for millions of dollars a year -- costs that would probably be passed on to utility customers.
Sears Island, in contrast, is owned by the state. Under a previous agreement with conservation groups, two-thirds of its woods and beaches are to be a nature preserve. The other third is zoned for a port.
Supporters of choosing the island site include Habib Dagher, a godfather of Maine's offshore wind efforts and the founding executive director of the University of Maine's Advanced Structures and Composites Center. He suggested it was worth trading the existing open space of the island for lower energy prices and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
"All of us would like to think that we can have renewable energy with zero impact on the environment -- as you know, it's not possible, right?" Dr. Dagher said in an interview at his wind lab. "So our goal, and our challenge, is, how do we minimize impact on environment as we embark on this transformational energy system?"
Conservation groups have fought development on Sears Island for decades, beating back a nuclear power plant, a gas import terminal and more. They reject the idea that they must lose that fight now -- even as they lament climate change.
Rolf Olsen is a retired marketing executive and an avid day hiker. He kayaks and likes to swim in Penobscot Bay after mowing his lawn. He drives a white plug-in Toyota Prius and is vice president of a group called Friends of Sears Island, and he sat on a state advisory panel over where to locate the wind port, which he says should be at Mack Point.
On a recent hike, he described what a Sears Island port might look like, in place of the oaks and the birches.
"I have a picture in my mind's eye. You know, it's huge, flat, towering concrete and steel," he said. "It saddens me."
So, he added, does the warming of the planet.
"I have a granddaughter who's 3. She's going to have to live in a different world."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A broad, and sometimes quixotic, retail effort to win the fight against global warming is playing out one person at a time, with nary a mention of climate change.
Like many people driving an electric car for the first time, Mikey Marohn had questions: Could he drive hundreds of miles to visit his father without stopping? Where would the chargers be? How did you turn it on?
"I'm anxious," said Mr. Marohn, a 34-year-old carpenter, as he settled behind the wheel of a Chevrolet Bolt near Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.
But after a test drive with Alicia Cox, executive director of Yellowstone-Teton Clean Cities, a nonprofit group that promotes green transportation, Mr. Marohn had gone from skeptical to curious.
"I would consider it," he said after Ms. Cox explained that he could save $ 3,000 a year in fuel costs if he replaced his Chevy Impala with a Bolt. "I'd like to save money and help the planet."
Green energy and transportation have advanced faster than many experts thought possible a few years ago. But many hurdles remain, including efforts by conservative politicians to prolong the use of coal, oil and gas and campaigns by environmentalists and local residents to block new wind turbines, transmission lines and mines.
Just as important will be persuading people like Mr. Marohn that electric cars, renewable energy and electric heaters and stoves are practical, economical and exciting.
Ms. Cox, who travels Wyoming offering free rides in the Chevy Bolt, is part of a broad, and sometimes quixotic, retail effort to win hearts and minds in the fight against climate change, one person at a time. Biden administration officials are trying to highlight to voters the economic benefits of his energy and industrial policies. Corporations like General Motors, which makes the Bolt, are spending billions of dollars to build electric vehicles they hope to sell everywhere, even in conservative states like Wyoming.
In conversations with activists, policymakers and corporate executives, it becomes clear that a save-the-planet argument doesn't go very far. Most people won't buy green technology unless it will clearly save them money and wows them with stunning designs or jaw-dropping performance.
Many, conservatives in particular, chafe at the prospect of the government forcing them to buy electric cars or ditch their natural gas appliances, polls show. That's perhaps why those pitching the technology often avoid mentioning climate change. They emulate evangelists who don't lead with Jesus when trying to win over nonbelievers.
A clean energy future will require painstaking and individually tailored persuasion campaigns. About half of Americans say they are not interested in buying electric cars, and a little more than half say they have not seriously considered solar panels, heat pumps or electric water heaters, a recent Pew Research Center survey found.
"I never expect anyone to adopt an E.V. on the first go of it," Ms. Cox said. "They need someone walking along beside them as they are making the decision."
Selling Green Energy
Jae Landreth operates a solar installation business in Baldwin City, Kan., a rural town southwest of Kansas City. Though he believes in climate change, he said, he "learned the hard way" not to mention it when marketing solar panels to his neighbors.
"That's not how you sell it," he said over coffee at his home. "Nobody's ever going to make a decision unless it benefits them in a money sense."
Mr. Landreth, an ebullient man who plays percussion in a Phil Collins tribute band, owns a Tesla, an electric off-road vehicle and an electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup he uses for his business, Solar Planet.
His enthusiasm for electric vehicles is hardly the norm in this patch of corn-and-cattle country. It's not unusual for drivers of Teslas and Toyota Prius hybrids to get "coal-rolled" by diesel trucks rigged to produce clouds of black exhaust on demand.
One of Mr. Landreth's customers is Rob Leach, a dairy farmer. Mr. Leach hired Mr. Landreth to install solar panels on his barn when it was rebuilt after a 2019 tornado. The panels power the large fans that were keeping Mr. Leach's cows cool on a July day when the temperature was in the high 90s.
Cost was crucial, according to Mr. Leach. "I said, 'I just want to know at the end of the month, am I going to be paying less even with my investment in solar?' And that has been the case."
Mr. Leach has since encouraged other farmers to install solar panels. "I've had several friends of mine that were, you know, not necessarily trying to save the planet," he said. "They just wanted to save money."
The Inflation Reduction Act passed by Democrats last year allocated hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives for wind and solar manufacturing, electric vehicles and other clean energy.
Although no Republicans voted for the bill, much of the money has gone to G.O.P.-led states in the South where many automakers, battery manufacturers and solar companies are building factories in part to take advantage of the law's tax breaks.
Getting credit for the new jobs is a political imperative for President Biden, who will be seeking re-election next year. That helps explains why his energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, spent part of July traversing the Southeast in a caravan of electric vehicles.
Ms. Granholm stopped at universities and elementary schools, a hardware store and a Baptist church. She made the case that federal investment in clean energy is creating thousands of jobs, saving consumers money and even protecting the nation against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has used fossil fuel exports to exert pressure.
Not on Ms. Granholm's list of reasons to go green: climate change.
Sipping black coffee at a Starbucks outside Memphis. Ms. Granholm said she liked to focus on how Biden administration policies were turning the region into a vibrant manufacturing hub. "It's important to lean on the message that makes sense for people where they are."
Jobs and Savings
In North and South Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee -- states on Ms. Granholm's itinerary -- solid majorities accept that global warming is real, according to detailed polling by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. But there is widespread skepticism that humans are responsible.
"The climate has always been changing," said Sue Burns, 59, at a gathering of Pontiac car enthusiasts in Murfreesboro, Tenn. "The left is out of control" in insisting that burning fossil fuels is causing a planetary crisis, Ms. Burns said.
Yet Ms. Burns drives a Prius -- a far cry from a Pontiac muscle car -- that runs on an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. She said she had bought the car to save money on gas.
Among residents benefiting from the economic boost, attitudes may be softening. Outside Dalton, Ga., Qcells, a maker of solar panels, is planning to expand a manufacturing plant. The factory is in the congressional district represented by Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican who has called fossil fuels "amazing" and climate change a "scam."
William Turner, 49, one of Ms. Greene's constituents, said he didn't "really buy into that stuff" about global warming. But he added, "I don't have anything against solar, especially if it's creating jobs."
The true test of public opinion will come when the promised factories are up and running, said Jason Walsh, the executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a partnership of unions and environmental groups.
"Political messaging and press announcements" will not convince anyone, Mr. Walsh said. "But a paycheck might."
In Democratic strongholds, Ms. Granholm's clean energy message went down more smoothly. Yet even there, many people said they needed to think with their pocketbooks, not their principles.
"I care about climate change," said Tia Williams, 29, eating lunch with a friend at the Georgia Institute of Technology before an appearance by Ms. Granholm. But she said she wasn't planning to buy an electric car because they were too expensive.
"I know the corporations love them, but I don't see much use for them myself," Ms. Williams said of federal incentives designed to make electric vehicles more affordable.
Slightly less than half of Democrats say they support phasing out fossil fuels, according to Pew. And just 12 percent of Republicans support doing so. That's perhaps why Mr. Biden tends to emphasize the economic upside of his policies.
In July, Mr. Biden went to South Carolina, where he taunted Republicans who had voted against climate change and infrastructure bills yet were reaping their benefits. Mr. Biden toured Flex, which makes fast chargers for electric cars and is in the district represented by Joe Wilson, a Republican who said the Inflation Reduction Act was "to the detriment of American families."
"Didn't get much help from the other team, but that didn't stop us from getting it done," Mr. Biden told the crowd, speaking of the legislation.
Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat, said in an interview that Republicans were trying to block or roll back efforts to promote electric trucks and buses, energy efficiency and offshore wind development. But Mr. Cooper predicted that economics would prevail.
"Even if some of them deny the science of climate change, they can't deny good-paying jobs," he said.
Not 'Mission: Impossible'
In Wyoming, where coal, oil, natural gas and souped-up pickups are cherished, Patrick Lawson is fighting a lonely campaign.
A member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, he tries to get local businesses to install charging stations. He takes out his Tesla Model Y and Ford F-150 Lightning as an Uber driver at night, less to make money than to drum up interest in electric vehicles.
Once a year he participates in the Rocky Mountain Rebels Car Show in Riverton, which adjoins his reservation. "I just want to change the perception that electric cars are not as good as big, noisy muscle cars," Mr. Lawson said.
It's a tough sell. During a Friday night "cruise parade" that opened the show, Mr. Lawson's mother, Susan Lawson, drove a red Tesla Model X, its distinctive wing doors open. As she waited in a lumber store parking lot for the parade to start, a middle-age woman approached.
"Wow, it's a Tesla, beautiful car," said the woman, who identified herself only as Cheryl, "a patriot and small business owner."
But then her tone shifted. "I don't believe in electric cars," she said. "The government could turn them off. The government controls our electricity."
A few bystanders on the parade route commented favorably about the Tesla's looks. But there were brickbats, too. "They're on their way to Jackson," someone said, referring to the liberal resort town. "Good luck getting over the pass in that thing," shouted another.
After the Lawsons parked in front of the local Elks lodge, a man pretending to hold a machine gun fired a spray of imaginary bullets at the electric vehicles.
That kind of reaction doesn't deter Mr. Lawson, 42, who manages the tribe's internet company along with his small charging business, Wild West EV.
When Mr. Lawson arranged $ 174,000 to match a federal grant to install charging stations at the city hall and airport, the Riverton City Council declined the money. The one public charging station in town, outside a sandwich shop, is often blocked by trucks, sometimes deliberately parked horizontally to make charging impossible.
During an obstacle race that was part of the car show, another Tesla driver beat all 40 cars. Onlookers were impressed but still skeptical. "It doesn't fit everybody's needs," said Kent Wheeler, a technician at an auto body and paint shop.
Mr. Lawson remains optimistic. "I'm in it for the long haul," he said. "It's not 'Mission: Impossible."'
Ford Motor, G.M. and dozens of other companies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars to refit factories and build new ones to produce electric vehicles. They don't want to make cars that only Democrats buy.
One company confronting the marketing problem is Polaris, a Minnesota company that builds four-wheel off-road vehicles used by hunters and farmers.
In April, Polaris began selling a $ 25,000 electric vehicle called the Ranger XP Kinetic. Advertising barely mentions the environment, instead stressing its performance. The strategy seems to have worked. The initial production run sold out two hours after Polaris began taking orders.
"We knew the target customer," said Josh Hermes, vice president for electric off-road vehicles at Polaris. "We really focused in on the benefits of the product"
One of the first buyers was Paul Rosenzweig, a Georgia resident who is in the wholesale feed business and is skeptical that climate change is caused by mankind. Rather, Mr. Rosenzweig, who hunts deer, rabbit and squirrels in Louisiana, likes how quiet the Polaris is.
"You see more wildlife with electric than you do with the motor burning," he said.
When G.M. begins selling a battery-powered version of its Chevy Silverado pickup this year, it will emphasize the truck's 450-mile range and towing capacity.
The company's chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said the cars were winning people over. Customers are "figuring out they're really fun to drive, and it's really nice to not have to go to the gas station," she said in an interview.
There are tentative signs that conservative opposition is wavering.
The Republican-controlled Legislature in Alabama, where Mercedes-Benz makes electric cars and Polaris builds the Kinetic, has allocated $ 1 million a year for a campaign to encourage residents to buy electric vehicles.
"We want to make sure we embrace the jobs and economic opportunities that accompany this new generation of vehicles," Kenneth Boswell, director of the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, said in a statement.
Republican lawmakers in Missouri have sought to block Quinton Lucas, Kansas City's Democratic mayor, from raising the minimum wage, making buildings more energy-efficient and restricting gun ownership. But they have not tried to block Kansas City from buying electric cars and trucks, Mr. Lucas said.
Building inspectors and supervisors in the Fire Department drive electric cars. At the city-owned airport, electric tractors deliver baggage, and electric buses shuttle passengers. The technology saves the city thousands of dollars per vehicle in maintenance and fuel costs.
"They usually notice everything new that we do and often try to pre-empt it," Mr. Lucas said of the Legislature. "And so what that tells me is, actually, I don't see this being a flashpoint."

The Clean Energy Future Is Roiling Both Friends and Foes

If there is anywhere in the country primed to welcome the clean energy transition, it is Penobscot Bay in Maine. Electricity prices there are high and volatile. The ocean waters are warming fast, threatening the lobster fishery. Miles offshore, winds blow strong enough to heat every home and power every car in the state.
For more than 15 years, researchers at the University of Maine have been honing scale models of floating wind turbines inspired by oil rigs. They are now confident they can mass-produce turbine blades the length of football fields and float them miles into the ocean. It is the kind of breakthrough in clean energy technology that is allowing a much faster transition to renewables than many believed possible, aided by state officials eager to pioneer a floating wind industry.
One key to harnessing that wind lies at the end of a causeway jutting into the bay, on a mostly undeveloped island where eagles fish offshore and people walk in the quiet shade. Many officials see this spot, known as Sears Island, as the ideal site to build and launch a flotilla of turbines that could significantly lessen Maine’s reliance on fossil fuels.
Standing in their way are environmental groups and local residents, all of whom are committed to a clean energy future and worried about the rapid warming of the Earth. Still, they want the state to pick a different site for its so-called wind port, citing the tranquility of Sears Island and its popularity and accessibility as a recreation destination.
On a recent summer morning one conservationist against the plan, Scott Dickerson, sat on a picnic bench and predicted environmental groups would sue to thwart development of the island, as they had many times in the past.
“And that, as you can imagine, is going to run the clock,” he said, costing the state valuable time that could be saved by looking elsewhere.
After years of fits and starts, the transition to renewable energy like wind and solar power is finally shifting into full gear in many parts of the world, including the United States, which has been buoyed by massive new subsidies from the Biden administration. But around the country, the effort is being slowed by a host of logistical, political and economic challenges.
Breaks in supply chains have stalled big projects. Historically low unemployment makes it hard to hire workers to build or install new turbines or solar panels. Shortcomings in the power grid can block newly generated electricity from reaching customers. Federal, state and local regulations, including often byzantine permitting requirements, threaten to delay some construction for years. So do the court battles that almost inevitably follow those permitting decisions.
These problems are not unique to the United States. In Europe, orders for new turbines dropped unexpectedly last year as developers struggled with inflation and sluggish permitting. In parts of China, a growing fraction of electricity from turbines and solar panels is being wasted because the grid lacks capacity. In Australia, clean energy companies have complained about a shortage of skilled workers.
At the same time, it tends to take longer to build solar arrays, wind farms, car chargers and transmission lines in the United States than in China, India and Europe, a recent analysis by the International Energy Agency found.
But no hurdle to a clean energy transition at the speed and scale scientists say is needed to avert catastrophic warming is easier to see than the growing local backlash to large-scale wind and solar projects, like the one roiling Sears Island.
The problem boils down to this: If lawmakers want to ramp up renewables as fast and cheaply as possible, they’ll need to bulldoze or build over some places that people treasure.
While Americans broadly support renewable energy, polls show, they are less enthusiastic about having it in their backyard. One survey from 2021 found that only 24% of Americans were willing to live within 1 mile of a solar farm; the number dropped to 17% for wind farms.
Such resistance is often rooted in anxieties about broader social and economic change in communities where families have lived for generations. But in some cases, like lawsuits trying to stop wind farm development off Massachusetts, groups with funding from fossil fuel interests have stoked fear. Those efforts are their own sort of obstacle to renewables: an attempt by incumbent energy players to protect their market share, even if the economics have turned against them.
A recent analysis found that it would cost less for electric utilities to build new wind and solar farms than to operate most of the existing coal-fired power plants — a stunning shift from 15 years ago, when burning coal was the cheapest way to make electricity.
But after years of rapid growth, installations of wind, solar and batteries slowed by 15% last year, according to the American Clean Power Association, a trade group.
“There’s a lot of capital ready to flow,” said Gregory Wetstone, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, another trade group. “But to get these projects going, you need to get them permitted, you need to get them connected to the grid, you need workers, you need access to supply chains. All of that can still be quite difficult.”
In Maine, many of those challenges are concentrated at one choke point: where to put a new wind port, which state officials have not decided on.
Offshore turbines need a large slab of land where they can be built and launched to sea. That site must connect to highways, to truck in materials, but also sit beside deep water.
The state’s two main contenders are in Searsport, about 30 miles south of Bangor.
One site is an industrial area, Mack Point, clearly visible from Sears Island. It is the spot many locals and conservationists prefer. The company that owns it says it could be easily converted to build and ship offshore turbines.
But some officials have warned that it could be difficult for Mack Point to secure needed permits from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies in order to dredge the bay and build new port facilities.
In Searsport, many residents fear that state officials will bypass Mack Point, which sits on private land and would need to be leased for millions of dollars a year — costs that would probably be passed on to utility customers.
Sears Island, in contrast, is owned by the state. Under a previous agreement with conservation groups, two-thirds of its woods and beaches are to be a nature preserve. The other third is zoned for a port.
Supporters of choosing the island site include Habib Dagher, a godfather of Maine’s offshore wind efforts and the founding executive director of the University of Maine’s Advanced Structures and Composites Center. He suggested it was worth trading the existing open space of the island for lower energy prices and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
“All of us would like to think that we can have renewable energy with zero impact on the environment — as you know, it’s not possible, right?” Dagher said in an interview at his wind lab. “So our goal, and our challenge, is: How do we minimize impact on environment as we embark on this transformational energy system?”
Conservation groups have fought development on Sears Island for decades, beating back a nuclear power plant, a gas import terminal and more. They reject the idea that they must lose that fight now — even as they lament climate change.
Rolf Olsen is a retired marketing executive and an avid day hiker. He kayaks and likes to swim in Penobscot Bay after mowing his lawn. He drives a white plug-in Toyota Prius and is vice president of a group called Friends of Sears Island, and he sat on a state advisory panel over where to locate the wind port, which he says should be at Mack Point.
On a recent hike, he described what a Sears Island port might look like, in place of the oaks and the birches.
“I have a picture in my mind’s eye. You know, it’s huge, flat, towering concrete and steel,” he said. “It saddens me.”
So, he added, does the warming of the planet.
“I have a granddaughter who’s 3. She’s going to have to live in a different world.”

Body Camera Alters Account By the Police Of a Shooting: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Philadelphia police commissioner says that contrary to initial statements by the department, the driver was in his car when he was fatally shot.
The initial account on Monday afternoon of how a Philadelphia police officer had fatally shot a 27-year-old man was straightforward: After a brief car chase, a man wielding a knife got out of his car and lunged at the officer, who shot and killed him, police said at the scene, according to local press reports.
But at a news conference on Wednesday, top police officials gave a very different account. According to body camera footage, the officials said, the man was still in his car when the officer shot him.
"I understand and want to acknowledge the hurt and confusion that family and community members can experience when details of investigations change, and especially when they change in a very public way," Danielle M. Outlaw, the Philadelphia police commissioner, said. "I also understand that the information I'm about to provide will raise additional questions," she added.
The police have not named the person who was killed. However, family members identified him as Eddie Irizarry, 27, a quiet and withdrawn man who, they said, liked to tinker with motorcycles and was being treated for serious mental illness, including schizophrenia. "He didn't have problems with anybody," his sister, Maria Irizarry, said in an interview. She said that her brother, who had moved to Philadelphia about seven years ago from Puerto Rico, did not understand English.
In the news conference, Ms. Outlaw provided the following account of what the department now says occurred: Shortly after noon on Monday, two officers were sitting in a marked police car when they saw a Toyota Corolla driving erratically in the Kensington neighborhood in northern Philadelphia. The officers, whose names have not been released by the department, followed the car as it turned the wrong way down a one-way street and watched it pull into a parking spot midway down the block.
The officers approached the car from different sides. The officer on the passenger side tried to open the door, then alerted the officer on the driver's side that the man in the car had a weapon, Ms. Outlaw said. The officer on the driver's side then fired "multiple times into the vehicle," killing the man.
At the same news conference, Peter Marrero, a detective who is investigating the shooting, said that two knives were found in the car: a "kitchen-style knife" and a "a serrated folding knife." Ms. Irizarry said that her brother did carry a pocketknife everywhere he went but "always as a tool, not as a weapon."
At the scene of the shooting on Monday, a police spokeswoman told reporters that the driver had initially fled from officers and that after he stopped, he got out of the car with his knife and ignored commands for him to drop it. He then "lunged" at the officers before one of them shot him, she added.
None of that account appears to be true.
At the news conference on Wednesday, the chief of detectives, Christine Coulter, said that version of events was "something that was called into police radio." She said that on Tuesday, once the department's Officer Involved Shooting Investigation Unit had looked at body camera footage, officials realized that the initial account was wrong. The footage has not been made public.
"I understand folks not really being sure whether or not they should even trust what we're saying today because of what we said initially," Ms. Outlaw said. "But I'm hoping that they see that this is a genuine effort to do everything that we can to share what we know when we have it."
Officials said the shooting was being investigated by the police internal affairs unit to determine whether the officers followed department policy and by the district attorney's office to determine whether a crime had been committed. Police said that both offices were equipped with Tasers at the time of the shooting. The officer who fired the fatal shots has so far been identified only as a "five-year veteran" of the department; under department policy, an officer's name is released within 72 hours of a shooting.
According to the department's statistics, there have been two other "officer involved shootings" this year, neither of them fatal. There were 15 such shootings last year, five of them fatal.
None of this is comfort to Mr. Irizarry's family members, who said they had obtained a lawyer.
"They changed the story and they keep changing the story," his aunt, Zoraida Garcia, said on her way to make funeral arrangements. "What they're saying are lies. What the police did to my nephew was an abuse."

Richard J. Whalen, 87, Biographer of Kennedy Family's Patriarch: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His book about the patriarch of the Kennedy political dynasty was a best seller. He later worked, briefly and not happily, for Richard M. Nixon.
Richard J. Whalen, who in his diverse career wrote a best-selling biography of Joseph P. Kennedy, the patriarch of the Democratic political dynasty, before joining Richard M. Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign as a speechwriter -- but who left before the election and wrote a critical book about him -- died on July 18 in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. He was 87.
His daughter, Laura Whalen Aram, said his death, at a nursing home, was caused by pneumonia.
Mr. Whalen was 27 and working at Fortune when the magazine published his 13,000-word profile of Joseph Kennedy in January 1963. His article described how he had accumulated great wealth and rose to become chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and then, early in his time as the United States ambassador to Britain, with the war looming, "publicly urged coexistence between the Western democracies and Hitler's Germany."
But, the article continued, what he craved more than money was political success for his sons. "While making money," Mr. Whalen wrote, "Kennedy managed to raise three attractive, persuasive sons who come easily to leadership. Wealth made their arrival easier; it didn't guarantee it."
By early 1963, his eldest surviving son, John, was the president of the United States; his middle son, Robert, was the attorney general; and his youngest, Edward, was a senator from Massachusetts.
"In a way that goes deeper than ordinary parental pride," Mr. Whalen wrote, "their success is his."
Mr. Whalen soon had a dozen publishers, by his count, asking him to turn the article into a book. He received a $ 100,000 advance (about $ 1 million in today's dollars) from New American Library to write "The Founding Father: The Story of Joseph P. Kennedy" (1964), which preceded by decades other biographies of Mr. Kennedy like David Nasaw's "The Patriarch: The Remarkable Life and Turbulent Times of Joseph P. Kennedy" (2012).
"What was astounding," Mr. Nasaw said in a phone interview, "was that he had almost none of the documentation that I and other Kennedy biographers have had and he was able to ferret out so much information about this guy and get a sense of the conflicts, controversies and drive that motivated him."
"The Founding Father" spent 28 weeks on The New York Times's hardcover best-seller list.
Mr. Whalen left Fortune in 1965 to be a writer in residence at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan policy research think tank that at the time was affiliated with Georgetown University. An article that he wrote for the center in 1967, about nuclear defense, attracted the interest of Nixon, who asked him to be an adviser and speechwriter as he sought the Republican presidential nomination.
But Mr. Whalen, a conservative, left the campaign shortly after Nixon's nomination in August 1968. At the time, he attributed his departure to clashes with John Mitchell, the campaign manager, and other aides. But four years later, in his book "Catch the Falling Flag: A Republican's Challenge to His Party," Mr. Whalen detailed his disappointments with Nixon, including his pledge in March 1968 to end the Vietnam War, presumably swiftly, if President Lyndon B. Johnson didn't end it by the end of the year.
"This promise, implying a plan to fulfill it, splashed across the front pages and brought the reporters and TV crews rushing back to the Republican side of the New Hampshire campaign, eager for details," he wrote. "There weren't any. Nothing lay behind the 'pledge' except Nixon's instinct for an extra effort of salesmanship when the customers started drifting away."
Richard James Whalen was born on Sept. 23, 1935, in Brooklyn. His father, George, was a textile executive, and his mother, Veronica (Southwick) Whalen, was a bookkeeper.
After earning his bachelor's degree in 1957 from Queens College, where he studied English and political science, he was hired as a reporter at The Richmond News Leader in Virginia. While there he wrote about school desegregation and later became an editorial writer, working for James J. Kilpatrick, the paper's editor, who was also a nationally known conservative columnist.
In 1960, Mr. Whalen left for Time magazine, where, as a national affairs correspondent, he covered the civil rights movement. Soon after that he moved to The Wall Street Journal as an editorial writer, but in 1962 he returned to Time Inc., where he became a staff writer at Fortune.
Mr. Whalen later recalled that Henry Luce, Time Inc.'s co-founder and editor in chief, assigned him to write the profile of Joseph Kennedy, a longtime acquaintance of Mr. Luce's. The Kennedys refused to cooperate on either the article or the book that followed.
"They weren't happy," Joan (Giuffré) Whalen, Mr. Whalen's wife, said by phone. But, she added, "We were told that Rose Kennedy enjoyed reading the book and marking it up."
Mr. Whalen's experiences with the think tank and the Nixon campaign led him to other political work. He worked as a consultant and writer for William P. Rogers, Nixon's secretary of state, from 1969 to 1970 and as a personal adviser to Ronald Reagan both before and during his presidency.
In the late 1960s, Mr. Whalen started World Wide Information Resources, which provided his analyses of politics, economics and foreign policy to subscribers, first via telex and then via fax and email. His clients as a lobbyist included Toyota Motor Sales USA, Toshiba America and the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
"I'm a free trader who believes deeply that the U.S. market is regulated by the consumer," he told The Richmond Times-Dispatch in 1987 when asked about his lobbying for Japanese companies while the United States had a large trade deficit. "We are absolutely sure to injure ourselves if we go the protectionist route."
In addition to his wife and daughter, Mr. Whalen is survived by his sons, R. Christopher and Michael; four grandchildren; and a brother, George.
Mr. Whalen's book about President Nixon was published in May 1972, a month before the Watergate break-in, which evolved into the scandal that led to his resignation two years later. While promoting the book, Mr. Whalen mocked Nixon as a monarch living in a "splendid court" and castigated him for falling short of his promises as a conservative Republican.
"The difference between what your administration has done and proposed to do, and what a Humphrey administration would have done, is not very significant," he wrote in an opinion article for The New York Times, referring to his Democratic opponent in the 1968 election, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey.
"I, too, know that you have a philosophy, to which you once privately gave the name 'conservative,"' he continued. "Publicly, however, you give your government the label 'centrist,' which shifts meaning so often as to be meaningless."

Full text: The United Auto Workers leader vowed to be tougher than his predecessors in contract talks. His initial demands attach big numbers to that promise.
Detroit may be headed for a tumultuous labor showdown.
The United Auto Workers union has made a bold opening bid in negotiations for new four-year collective bargaining agreements with General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis. Its new president, Shawn Fain, has declared that the 150,000 hourly workers employed by the companies are prepared to strike to achieve the union's goals.
The U.A.W. presented the automakers with a list of demands, including a 40 percent wage increase -- premised on the compensation gains that the union says the companies' chief executives have made over the four years since the last contract talks.
And with the pivot to electric vehicles, the union wants guarantees that workers hired at the automakers' new E.V. battery plants will be covered by the U.A.W. national contracts, or at least given contracts with comparable wage and safety terms.
"I know these demands sound ambitious, but the Big Three are making record profits, so I also know they can easily afford it," Mr. Fain said in an interview. "We have to be a lot more aggressive to negotiate better agreements, to set a standard that raises people up to a middle-class life."
In addition to higher pay, the demands include regular cost-of-living wage increases, pension plans for a greater number of workers and a job security plan for workers when plants are shuttered. The U.A.W. also hopes to push Stellantis to reopen a plant in Belvidere, Ill., that was idled this year, putting 1,350 people out of work.
And it wants a workweek comprising four eight-hour days on the assembly line and a fifth day with eight hours of paid time off -- essentially a 32-hour week. Mr. Fain said many workers typically worked 50 or 60 hours a week, leaving little time for family activities or rest.
In a statement, G.M. said that it expected a new contract to provide increased wages, and that it was "important to protect U.S. manufacturing and jobs in an industry that is dominated by nonunionized competition." But the U.A.W.'s demands, the company added, "would threaten our ability to do what's right for the long-term benefit of the team."
Ford said it aimed to work with the U.A.W. on "creative solutions," without elaborating. Stellantis said it intended to "fairly reward" its workers but warned that any agreement must not "jeopardize our ability to continue investing" in new vehicles and technologies.
The automakers are investing tens of billions of dollars in electric vehicles but have yet to see significant sales or profits from them. The union is concerned that the move to E.V.s could cost thousands of jobs because electric vehicles generally require fewer workers to produce than traditional gasoline-powered cars and trucks.
Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor who follows the auto industry, said he expected that the union would score some gains -- up to a point. "I think there will be substantial wage increases, and I think the companies can afford higher wages," he said.
But he said the automakers were likely to resist other union demands, like the shorter workweek, company-paid health care for retirees or the ability to strike over plant closings. "The companies can't afford anything that puts them in a straitjacket," Mr. Gordon said. "With the E.V. transition, they are going to need flexibility to adjust plants and maybe even close plants."
Mr. Fain, an insurgent who upset the incumbent president in an election this year on a vow to bring a tougher approach to negotiations, shrugged off the notion that the union's demands would put the companies at a cost disadvantage against rivals like Toyota, Honda and Tesla, which operate nonunion plants in the United States.
"These companies are very competitive," he said of the Detroit manufacturers, noting that each had reported substantial profits over the past 10 years, and that most of their profits come from North America. In the first half of the year, Stellantis made a record 10.9 billion euros, about $ 12 billion. G.M. generated $ 5 billion in profit in the same period.
Union officials frequently note that for many years before the companies' renaissance, the U.A.W. agreed to lower pay, less costly retirement provisions for new hires and other concessions that helped the automakers regain their competitive edge after falling into dire straits and even -- for G.M. and for Stellantis's predecessor, Chrysler -- bankruptcy.
The companies' bottom lines, along with their leaders' pay, have become a rallying cry for the U.A.W. The union estimates that the chief executives -- Mary T. Barra of G.M., Jim Farley of Ford and Carlos Tavares of Stellantis -- collectively saw about a 40 percent rise in total compensation in the past four years.
In 2022, Ms. Barra received a compensation package, including salary, stock awards and bonuses, worth $ 29 million, according to financial filings. Mr. Farley's package was worth $ 21 million, and Mr. Tavares's €23.5 million.
"I think they should apply the same compensation principles to the workers that the C.E.O.s apply to themselves," Mr. Fain said. (Stock awards and bonuses, unlike wages and salaries, can vary and even decline depending on share price and company performance.)
The current agreements, which lapse Sept. 14, were reached in 2019 only after a six-week strike at G.M. -- the company that the union designated in that cycle as its negotiating target. This time, Mr. Fain says all three companies are targets.
His supporters say it may be difficult to achieve some of the union's main goals without walking out again, especially the demand that workers at electric vehicle battery plants are entitled to the same pay, benefits and safety standards as U.A.W. members at other factories.
Several battery plants are joint ventures between the Big Three and foreign battery manufacturers. A provision making it relatively easy to unionize plants owned entirely by the automakers does not apply to workers at jointly operated plants, nor would those plants automatically come under the autoworkers' national contracts if they did unionize. The battery plants are often in lightly unionized states where organizing can be difficult.
Auto company officials have said they rely on joint ventures to gain access to the expertise of other manufacturers and to help raise the enormous sums of capital such projects require.
Under President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, the federal government is providing loans to ease the cost of building the battery plants, as well as tax credits to lower the cost of the battery packs they will make.
Mr. Fain said the government should require recipients of these loans and credits to provide middle-class wages for workers. At $ 16.50 an hour, some workers at an E.V. battery plant operated by G.M. in Ohio "are scraping by and working two jobs," he said. (The plant's starting wage is $ 16.50, rising to about $ 20 after seven years. Under G.M.'s national contract, the wage is $ 17 for new hires and increases to $ 32 after eight years.)
Union officials argue that failing to bring battery workers up to the standards of the national agreements will eventually undermine the U.A.W. by allowing automakers to circumvent the union.
"I think it's existential -- it's a demand that we can't bend on," said Scott Houldieson, chairperson of Unite All Workers for Democracy, a reform group within the union that assembled the slate of candidates that Mr. Fain and other new leaders ran on.
When asked whether the union could strike the automakers over the issue, Mr. Houldieson, a worker at a Ford assembly plant in Chicago, added: "Are they going to take it to the wall? We will. We'll take it to the wall because it's our existence."

Detroit may be headed for a tumultuous labor showdown.
The United Auto Workers union has made a bold opening bid in negotiations for new four-year collective bargaining agreements with General Motors, Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis. Its new president, Shawn Fain, has declared that the 150,000 hourly workers employed by the companies are prepared to strike to achieve the union’s goals.
The UAW presented the automakers with a list of demands, including a 40% wage increase — premised on the compensation gains the union says the companies’ CEOs have made over the four years since the last contract talks.
And with the pivot to electric vehicles, the union wants guarantees that workers hired at the automakers’ new EV battery plants will be covered by the UAW national contracts, or at least given contracts with comparable wage and safety terms.
“I know these demands sound ambitious, but the Big Three are making record profits, so I also know they can easily afford it,” Fain said in an interview. “We have to be a lot more aggressive to negotiate better agreements, to set a standard that raises people up to a middle-class life.”

Teen Is Charged With Hate Crime in Killing of Dancer: [National Desk]

Full text: He faces a charge of second-degree murder, which has been charged as a hate crime, in the fatal stabbing of Mr. Sibley, a gay man, last week.
A 17-year-old has been charged with murder in the killing of O'Shae Sibley, who was stabbed to death on July 29 after a dispute over his dancing at a Brooklyn gas station.
Mr. Sibley, a gay man who was a professional dancer and choreographer, was returning from New Jersey to his home in Brooklyn with four friends that night when the group stopped at a gas station in the Midwood neighborhood, the police said on Saturday. As they filled up their car, they played Beyoncé's "Renaissance" album and began dancing, officials said, at which point a group of men approached and told them to stop.
"We can see on the video the heated verbal dispute quickly turns physical," Joseph Kenny, an assistant chief at the New York Police Department's detective bureau, said at a news conference with Mayor Eric Adams announcing the arrest.
The men yelled homophobic slurs and anti-Black statements at Mr. Sibley, who was Black, and his friends, Mr. Kenny said, all while demanding they stop dancing. Bystanders acted as "peacemakers," and the men shouting at Mr. Sibley's group began to disperse, Mr. Kenny said -- except for the defendant.
Video of the encounter, which lasted about four minutes, shows the teenager stabbing Mr. Sibley once in the chest, "damaging his heart," Mr. Kenny said. A witness said the teenager then jumped into a Toyota Highlander that sped off. Mr. Sibley was taken to Maimonides Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead that night.
The teenager, whom the police did not name, lives in Brooklyn and was identified by the police earlier this week using video and by working with other city agencies, Mr. Kenny said. The suspect turned himself in through an arrangement with his lawyer, Mr. Kenny added. He has been charged with second-degree murder, which has been charged as a hate crime, and with criminal possession of a weapon.
At the news conference, Mr. Adams said that Mr. Sibley's family had been affected by something that "clearly" was a hate crime.
"This is a city where you are free to express yourself," Mr. Adams said. "And that expression should never end with any form of violence."
For many people, the death of Mr. Sibley -- whom friends described as friendly, fun-loving and passionate about his art -- was a shocking and violent reminder of the discrimination L.G.B.T.Q. people face. It inspired an outpouring of grief over several days.
On Thursday evening, about 80 mourners gathered at the Stonewall Inn, the Greenwich Village bar known as the cradle of the gay rights movement. The next night, at an event at the Midwood Mobil station where Mr. Sibley was killed, attendees were encouraged to "vogue as an act of resistance" -- a reference to the style of dance performed by Mr. Sibley and his friends. The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center in Greenwich Village announced it would hold a memorial on Saturday evening. Public figures have also paid tribute: On Beyoncé's website, "Rest in Power O'Shae Sibley" was prominently displayed against a black backdrop.
Summy Ullah, a 32-year-old gas station attendant who witnessed the confrontation, said one of the men who approached Mr. Sibley and his friends had said: "I'm Muslim. I don't want this here."
At the news conference on Saturday, flanked by leaders from the city's gay and Muslim communities, Mr. Adams emphasized that Mr. Sibley's killing was not evidence of hatred directed at L.G.B.T.Q. people by Muslims in New York, and spoke about how both groups have been victims of hate. The two communities "stand united against fighting any form of hate in this city," he said.
Lee Soulja Simmons, executive director of the NYC Center For Black Pride, said he met Mr. Sibley about six years ago when Mr. Sibley was performing in an Off Broadway show about Black pride.
Mr. Simmons said that Black gay New Yorkers were wrestling with his death, while also living with the specter of hate crimes and discrimination being directed at them because of their identities.
Mr. Sibley "was doing nothing more but vogueing and dancing here," he added. "He did not deserve to die in that way."

Fatally Stabbed Dancer Found a Community That Saw Him Thrive: [National Desk]

Full text: O'Shae Sibley was determined to succeed in New York, where he had joined a community of artists and performers who pushed him to strive.
Karen Pendergrass kept seeing the lanky boy walk by the lunchroom where she taught dance twice a week to eighth grade students in North Philadelphia. He would peer inside, then run away as soon as Ms. Pendergrass made eye contact.
"You come peeking in my door one more time and you're coming in my class," Ms. Pendergrass told him. "From there, he never left."
For the next 15 years, O'Shae Sibley danced, working on the side as a delivery man, waiter and cleaner between auditions and performances in Philadelphia and New York, where he moved to further his career. At 28, he was preparing to audition for "The Lion King," one of his favorite Broadway musicals.
But on Saturday, Mr. Sibley and his friends made a quick stop at a Brooklyn gas station as they came back from a beach day. They were blasting Beyoncé and dancing around the car when a group of about three young men told them to stop and hurled gay slurs at them.
Summy Ullah, a 32-year-old gas station attendant who witnessed the encounter, said one of the young men said, "I'm Muslim. I don't want this here."
Mr. Sibley and his friends argued with them, and one young man began recording Mr. Sibley and his friends on his phone while cursing at them. Mr. Sibley followed the group and Mr. Ullah, who rushed over to prevent a fight, saw the young man who was recording pull out a knife.
Mr. Ullah said he did not realize Mr. Sibley had been stabbed until he saw the blood.
"I can't forget what I've seen," said Mr. Ullah. "It's not the gay guys' fault, because they were minding their own business. They didn't do anything."
The killing has shocked New Yorkers and galvanized the gay community with grief. Some are planning vigils and others have called on the public to gather at the Mobil gas station on Coney Island Avenue and "vogue as an act of resistance," a reference to the stylized dancing that Mr. Sibley and his friends performed, one that mimics models' poses and blurs the lines of gender.
On Thursday evening at the Stonewall Inn, the Greenwich Village bar known as the cradle of the gay rights movement, about 80 mourners gathered. In a gospel cadence, they sang "O'Shae Sibley was freed today" as an ensemble of wind instruments played.
"He was just a beautiful spirit, a wonderful person, just exercising his freedom to be alive," said Sunder Ganglani, 42, who rode his bike to the demonstration with a picture of Mr. Sibley attached to his rear wheel.
On Beyoncé's website, "Rest in Power O'Shae Sibley" was prominently displayed against a black backdrop. Mayor Eric Adams called the attack an act of homophobia that violated the city's ethos of "knowing and loving people of all backgrounds."
"We'll bring justice for O'Shae's family and loved ones," he said in a social media post.
The police said they were searching for a man in his late teens in connection with the killing, and on Friday said they were speaking with a person of interest. The department's hate crimes unit is assisting in the investigation.
Brian Downey, a New York Police Department detective and president of the Gay Officers Action League, said the attack underscored the violence gay people face even in a city that is supposed to be a "refuge, a place of safety."
For Mr. Sibley, New York felt like a better haven than North Philadelphia, where he had to navigate the streets carefully, his friends said.
"For many Black gay men, there is code switching, where we have to walk more masculine presenting," said Kemar Jewel, 31, a dancer and choreographer who met Mr. Sibley when they were teenagers in Philadelphia. "Maybe we're wearing looser clothing or not looking people in the eye."
Joan Myers Brown, founder of the Philadelphia Dance School, gave Mr. Sibley a full scholarship after Ms. Pendergrass recommended him.
She was impressed with his determination. In a family of 11 siblings, there was rarely extra money. Ms. Brown recalled driving him home late at night from the studio in West Philadelphia when he didn't have car fare. Ms. Pendergrass often gave him food and clothing, Ms. Brown said.
"He had a tough fortitude," Ms. Brown said. "To handle New York, you have to be tough, and he was handling it."
In New York, Mr. Sibley moved freely. He vogued at Pier 46 on the Hudson River, a favorite hangout, and had a tight-knit group of friends who collaborated on videos, dance competitions and performances.
In June 2020, as the city was swept by demonstrations against police brutality, Mr. Sibley joined four other dancers who, dressed in black berets and black clothing, vogued in locations around the city for a video directed by Mr. Jewel. The video was meant to support the Black Lives Matter movement but also showcase the joy and resistance embodied in vogueing.
Mr. Jewel directed Mr. Sibley as he strutted, pirouetted and glided on tiptoe in front of masked police officers who watched him with curiosity.
"He was so intentional in his movements," Mr. Jewel said.
Soft-spoken, quiet and friendly, Mr. Sibley would deflect tense moments with a joke or silly comment, his friends said. But he was unafraid of confronting homophobia and bristled when anyone warned him that being open about his sexuality could draw hostility.
Beckenbaur Hamilton, 51, a neighbor and friend of Mr. Sibley, who lived alone in a studio apartment in Brownsville, remembered a boisterous party Mr. Sibley threw on July 2.
He and his friends were dancing, playing loud music and drinking. Mr. Hamilton, who is gay, said he worried the "wrong person" would overhear them and react violently.
When he warned Mr. Sibley and his friends, they laughed off his concerns, Mr. Hamilton said.
"I'm just telling you for your own safety: You don't know who is who," Mr. Hamilton said he told them. "They said, 'We are just living our truths."'
Iquail Shaheed, 39, a dancer and choreographer, met Mr. Sibley when the dancer was about 16 and they were both at the Philadelphia Dance School.
By that point, Mr. Sibley had joined the school's second company and Dr. Shaheed, an alumnus assigned to mentor him, was urging the younger dancer to draw from his experiences as a boy for a piece set to the song "Someday We'll All Be Free," by Donny Hathaway.
It conveyed the feelings of a "young Black male coming of age in a world that was devastatingly hard for him," Dr. Shaheed said.
To help Mr. Sibley connect with the work, Dr. Shaheed asked Mr. Sibley to think about what it felt like to hide his sexuality and to protect himself from those who would show hatred toward him.
"I was really pushing him," Dr. Shaheed said. Mr. Sibley struggled with the direction.
"O'Shae got really mad at me," he said. "It would really get to him."
The Monday before he died, Mr. Sibley met with Dr. Shaheed and said he wanted to take classes with him at his studio in Manhattan. He wanted intensive preparation for his "Lion King" audition.
"I wasn't fully ready for the way you were pushing me when I was younger," Mr. Sibley said, according to his friend. "I'm ready for it now. I know you're not going to be easy on me."
Mr. Sibley told him he had saved enough money to pay for the classes. Dr. Shaheed, who that week left for a performance in Belgium, had no intention of letting him pay. He planned to surprise Mr. Sibley with the news when he got back to New York.
Mr. Ullah said that just before the fight began on Saturday, he had been watching Mr. Sibley and his friends and was enjoying their exuberant display. Mr. Ullah said he tried to chase the young man who stabbed Mr. Sibley, but he jumped into a Toyota Highlander that sped off.
"This was the first time I saw a hate crime in this neighborhood where I work," Mr. Ullah said.
"I'm Muslim myself," said Mr. Ullah, who immigrated from Pakistan. "When I saw them dancing, I was laughing too but I wasn't making fun of them. Everyone has their own perspective, gay, transgender. We have gay people in our countries as well. You don't make fun of them. They don't say anything to you. They aren't making fun of you."
Dr. Shaheed said after news of the stabbing broke, someone sent him a brief 2016 clip of Mr. Sibley dancing to the Donny Hathaway song.
He has tried to imagine how happy and liberated Mr. Sibley must have felt during the last minutes of his life, jumping and vogueing with his friends.
"He was free," Dr. Shaheed said. "Dancing without a care in the world."

Pope Looks to 'Youth Day' as Opportunity to Energize Church's Future: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The pope will preside over a gathering of young people from around the world, mindful that the changes he has initiated in the Roman Catholic Church will depend on them.
Pope Francis, deep into his 80s, slowed by illness and aware that his window for bringing lasting change to the Roman Catholic Church is closing, arrived in Portugal on Wednesday for a weeklong meeting of the world's young Catholics, in whose hands will rest the ultimate success or failure of his vision for a more pastoral and inclusive faith.
"I am happy to have come to Lisbon, this city of encounter, which embraces many peoples and cultures, and which, in these days, is even more global," Francis told the country's leaders in a speech on Wednesday morning in the Presidential Palace, adding that it had become "in a certain sense" a world capital, but also "the capital of the future, because the young are the future."
Before the visit, the pope, 86, said in video remarks that he wanted "to see a seed for the world's future" planted in Lisbon, and warned against the church's becoming a "club" for older people that "will die." Upon his arrival, he urged the leaders to help realize the dreams of "young people from around the world, who long for unity, peace and fraternity."
"It is my hope that World Youth Day may be, for the 'Old Continent,' an impulse toward universal openness," he added, referring to Europe, where the church's following has dwindled as the population ages. "Old," Francis underlined. "Old, we can say the elderly Continent."
The gathering is expected to attract about a million people from more than 200 countries, many of them age 16 to 35, and many in sync with Francis' emphasis on inequality and climate issues.
In remarks, Francis supported their protection of the environment, their campaigning for peace and economic justice, including the redistribution of enormous wealth, and countering demographic decline.
The meeting will also be attended by more than 700 bishops and 20 cardinals. The gathering comes as Portugal grapples with an exploding clerical sexual abuse crisis and as Francis prepares to tackle issues like the role of women and L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics in the church at a major meeting of the world's bishops that will for the first time include women and laypeople.
As pope, Francis has sought to draw more people into the church by making it more welcoming and close to its people, and less focused on rules and abstractions, power and rank. World Youth Day, and Francis' emphasis on the young, is a way to keep a lifeline open to the future as the church's present, especially in the developed world, has been marked by scandals, decreasing numbers and declining cultural relevance.
It is growing more in the developing world, especially Africa and Asia, where young Catholics are more fervent. But those are also places where the church is more conservative.
Francis has steadily filled his hierarchy with prelates in his image, but has also often balked at opportunities to make concrete changes to church policy.
His supporters argue that the death of the retired and deeply conservative Pope Benedict XVI last year freed Francis from an awkward brake. And they say that his own health problems -- he recently left the hospital after yet another surgery -- have added urgency for him to start walking in a new direction rather than just talking about it.
There is also a view that Francis may be content to prepare the ground for a major shift, and to let his successor take the real leaps. But it is not clear who will follow Francis as pope.
In the meantime, Francis is also taking steps to rejuvenate the church. In a geriatric institution, he has put middle-aged men who share his pastoral approach in charge of major archdioceses like Buenos Aires, Brussels and Madrid. He has appointed cardinals in their 50s -- spring chickens for the church -- who could vote to select popes for decades to come.
The prelate in charge of World Youth Day, Américo Aguiar, only 49, will become a cardinal at a Sept. 30 ceremony during which Francis will elevate 21 churchmen. Bishop Aguiar will be the second-youngest cardinal after the head of the church in Mongolia, where Francis will travel at the end of August.
Pope John Paul II started World Youth Day in 1986 to demonstrate that the church had a younger, fresher face. The Lisbon event will be the 16th such engagement.
While Francis framed the fraternity of the meeting as an antidote to nationalism and populism, but far from being grass-roots movements, the events are rigorously planned and have not translated into an organic return back into the pews.
The Portuguese church has also sought to portray the event as interreligious, with the participation of Protestants, Muslims and Jews. It was an "event open to all," Cardinal Manuel Clemente, patriarch of Lisbon, told reporters last month.
That presence is shrinking though, even in once-devout Portugal. The Portuguese Catholic Church, like so many across Europe, has consistently diminished and weakened, even as evangelical Christians, many of them Brazilian, have multiplied their numbers.
Lisbon, once a pious capital, is now a cosmopolitan and increasingly secular city. Newly revealed sexual abuse scandals in the Portuguese church seem destined to accelerate its falling numbers.
In February, a live broadcast of experts appointed by Portugal's own church leaders reported that at least 4,815 children, most of them 10 to 14 years old, had been abused since 1950. The experts read accounts of some victims in front of the country's top bishops, and the commission's leader said that more than 100 priests suspected of abuse still had active church roles at the time of the report's publication.
Bishop Aguiar has said that Francis will meet with some of those victims during his visit, even as the Portuguese church has waffled on possible reparation payments. Francis is expected to address the issue during his visit.
The distance between the country and the church has also been shown by criticism for the tens of millions of euros directed to finance the event. In the days before the event, a Portuguese artist, Bordalo II, laid out a red carpet made from oversized 500-euro bank notes.
"In a secular state," the artist wrote, "at a time when many are struggling to keep their homes, their jobs and their dignity, millions of public money are going to sponsor the tour of the Italian multinational."
That is not the message the Vatican is hoping for.
Instead, Francis was welcomed on Wednesday morning by two children dressed in white and seemed at ease and beamed as he met bishops and joked with local dignitaries before taking a white Toyota hybrid in a motorcade along streets sparsely populated with cheering fans. Arriving at the presidential palace, he walked a few steps with a cane and stood beside President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa for national anthems and the ceremonial shooting of rifles.
Francis will seek to animate young crowds with talk of peace on a continent once again marked by war. Francis himself has made fruitless, and critics say counterproductive, efforts to broker peace in Ukraine that Ukrainians have worried play into Russian hands. After a halting start, Francis has more clearly put the fault of the war on Russian aggression.
The pope is likely to stress his calls for peace on Saturday, when he is scheduled to return to the Shrine of Fátima, a pilgrimage site north of Lisbon where tradition holds that the Virgin Mary appeared to three shepherd children in 1917. She delivered a prophecy that the world would be destroyed if it did not convert, and that the pope could stay God's angry hand if he brought atheists and Communist Russia to her "immaculate heart."
Last year, Francis consecrated all the world, but especially Russia and Ukraine, to the Immaculate Heart of Mary before a statue of Our Lady of Fatima in St. Peter's Basilica.
In his remarks to leaders on Wednesday, Francis sought to carve out a more concrete space for Europe in delivering peace.
"We are sailing amid storms on the ocean of history, and we sense the need for courageous courses of peace. With deep love for Europe, and in the spirit of dialogue that distinguishes this continent, we might ask her: 'Where are you sailing, if you are not showing the world paths of peace, creative ways for bringing an end to the war in Ukraine and to the many other conflicts causing so much bloodshed?"'

Mexican Cartels Fight the Drug War With 'Monster' Trucks: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Taking the monster truck concept to deadly new realms, cartels are modifying pickups with gun turrets, steel armoring and battering rams.
In the United States, some truck owners delight in modifying their rigs with oversized wheels, heavy-duty suspension kits and soot-spewing exhaust systems, turning them into the monster trucks that stalk organized events like demolition derbies and mud bogs.
How quaint.
In Mexico, drug cartels are taking the monster truck concept to another terrifying level, retrofitting popular pickups with battering rams, four-inch-thick steel plates welded onto their chassis and turrets for firing machine guns.
Some of Mexico's most feared criminal groups, including the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, are using the vehicles in pitched gun battles with the police. Other organizations, like the Gulf Cartel and the Northeast Cartel, use the armored trucks to fight each other.
Mexican security forces call these vehicles monstruos (monsters), but they are also known as rinocerontes (rhinos) and narcotanques (narco-tanks). Cartels emblazon the exteriors with their initials or the latest in camouflage patterns, at times making them hard to distinguish from official military vehicles.
Flashy interiors of larger trucks feature front seats with a cockpit-like array of buttons and lights, metal seats from where gunmen can lean their rifles through holes and, in the middle, a hatch similar to that of a tank.
As more trucks roll onto the streets of Mexico's violent towns and cities, the vehicles serve as a prism to view the evolution of the country's blood-soaked drug wars -- whether with dread over the cartels' capacity to outmaneuver efforts by the authorities to impose order or a grim recognition of the vehicles' postapocalyptic "Mad Max" vibe.
The spread of the behemoths is more evidence that cartels will go to any length "to try to enforce by violent means their dominance against adversary gangs and against authority," said Jorge Septién, a Mexico City-based expert on ballistics and armaments.
They also highlight the country's sputtering efforts against brutal criminal groups that operate with seeming impunity in many parts of Mexico.
The armored trucks are among the more visible and intimidating enhancements to the lethal arsenal at the disposal of Mexico's most powerful cartels, according to Romain Le Cour, a security analyst.
Other weapons and arms include steel-penetrating Barrett .50 caliber sniper rifles, rocket launchers and rocket-propelled grenades capable of shooting down military helicopters, drones fitted with remote-detonated explosives and roadside anti-vehicle mines, used in an attack last month in Jalisco that killed six people.
"The monsters are the way to send the message, 'I'm in charge, and I want everyone to see I'm in charge,"' said Mr. Le Cour, senior expert at the Switzerland-based Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime. "These are commando-style groups looking to replicate special forces in how they're armed, how they're trained, how they look."
While the trucks are thought to have emerged in Mexico a little more than a decade ago, they seem to be multiplying and growing more sophisticated, much in the way that narco-submarines built by criminal groups to transport drugs have adapted to elude capture.
The progression of the armored trucks has followed the flow of elite soldiers into cartels, starting with the recruitment in the 1990s of Mexican Army's special forces into a paramilitary operation that became the Zetas cartel.
From the weapons they use to the vehicles they drive, the involvement of members of specialized military units in criminal organizations has led these groups to emulate and compete with the country's elite forces.
The seizure of armored trucks helps shed light on regions where cartel operations are flourishing or resurgent, like in the states of Michoacán and Jalisco, on Mexico's Pacific Coast or along the United States border.
In June, the federal attorney general's office in the state of Tamaulipas, across the border from Texas, announced that it had captured and destroyed 14 monster trucks, following the destruction of 11 other similar vehicles in February.
The state prosecutor's office in Tamaulipas, in a statement last year, cited the "danger to the safety of the community" posed by the modified vehicles, which criminal groups often use to guard their illegal activities, particularly near the border.
In Tamaulipas alone, more than 260 armored trucks were destroyed by the authorities since 2019. Providing a national figure is difficult because various federal and state agencies confiscate and demolish them.
The assembling of the vehicles, often in rural workshops, draws on the well-known skills of cartel mechanics who have long focused on modifying cars to smuggle hidden cargoes of drugs across borders.
Armoring a truck with the basics, like steel plates, takes 60 to 70 days, the work of five to six welders and mechanics and costs roughly two million pesos, or about $ 117,000, according to security experts. (Extra features like turrets, bulletproof tires and battering rams will run up the bill.)
While armoring a vehicle without authorization is a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison, the law has done little to dent their robust production.
In Small Wars Journal, an American publication focusing on intrastate conflict, an analysis said "that such armored vehicles far outclass standard Mexican police armaments."
The trucks are typically crafted from standard-issue pickups, but the analysis noted the use by cartels of heavily armored "dump truck variants" that are immune to all but the anti-vehicle weapons possessed by Mexico's armed forces.
Monster trucks are often made from popular vehicles like the Ford Lobo (the equivalent of the Ford F-150 in the United States) or the Ford Raptor. But gangs also use sport-utility vehicles better known elsewhere for making runs to the suburban big box stores, like the bulky Chevrolet Tahoe, as well as larger flatbeds, dump trucks or heavy-duty "dually" trucks with two rear wheels on each side.
Underscoring the arms race between the cartels and Mexico's armed forces, some Mexican soldiers now carry shoulder-fired rocket launchers capable of destroying armored trucks.
The trucks gained prominence in 2020, when a video that surfaced on social media showed the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes -- one of the most wanted men in Mexico and the United States -- parading his private army on the border of the states of Michoacán and Guanajuato.
The show of force included several monster trucks, as well as camouflage-clad gunmen, their faces hidden behind balaclavas, firing weapons into the air as they shouted allegiance to Mr. Oseguera Cervantes.
Since then, the trucks have leaped into the public imagination. A video captured by a drone of an attack by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel against local police officers and residents using the trucks was shown on a national television network in 2021.
Despite their terrifying reputation, the trucks do have drawbacks. Unlike the fast-moving and nimble Toyota Hilux pickups mounted with machine guns used by armed groups in many parts of the world, monster trucks laden with steel plates can be sluggish and hard to maneuver, especially in urban settings.
"They're too slow, too heavy," said Alexei Chévez, a security analyst based in Cuernavaca, Mexico. And the retrofitting of the vehicles means that some of their parts malfunction. "We see them constantly breaking down and being abandoned," Mr. Chévez said.
Still, their strategic and symbolic importance resonates in a country that has witnessed years of horrific violence perpetrated by criminal groups. The trucks often appear on TikTok and other social media, accompanied by narco rap songs or folk ballads extolling cartel exploits.
"It has to do with a status symbol," Mr. Septién said. "The first ones we saw were practically blow-torched and welded in a very shoddy way."
These days, he added, when approaching from a distance, "they look like a military vehicle."

MEXICO CITY — In the United States, some truck owners delight in modifying their rigs with oversized wheels, heavy-duty suspension kits and soot-spewing exhaust systems, turning them into the monster trucks that stalk organized events such as demolition derbies and mud bogs.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Susan Faludi suggested we show up to the "Barbie" movie in a pink Corvette, but unfortunately, the only car available was a pickup truck. So that was how one of the world's leading feminists and I showed up to her local mall: in a 2002 black Toyota Tacoma, with tickets to Auditorium 2 for "Barbie."
I'd asked Ms. Faludi, the Pulitzer-winning journalist and author -- whose 1991 book, "Backlash," became an instant classic -- to see this summer's most joyful and lucrative blockbuster with me because I was hoping she might help me make sense of its morass of hot pink contradictions.
There are few toys quite so confounding as Barbie. Even her origin story: She was based on a sex doll for men, but somehow marketed to mothers for their daughters. Barbie has been a protest slogan ("I am not your Barbie"), a bimbo (remember "Math class is tough" Barbie?), an eating disorder accelerant. In one particularly clever protest against the doll, she had her voice box swapped with G.I. Joe's, so suddenly she said, "Vengeance is mine!" and he said, "The beach is the place for summer." But Barbie has also been a lawyer, a pilot, an astronaut and the president. She has never married, lives alone and does not have children.
The movie seemed as full of contradictions as the doll. It was promoted through a marketing campaign that had more licensing deals than Barbie has outfits: There were Barbie clothes and Barbie makeup and ice cream and vacation packages and a takeover of the Google home page, which is currently filling my screen with pink explosions every time I try to fact-check this essay. But it also had a director -- Greta Gerwig -- with indie street cred, and early reviews focused on the film's subversiveness. Ms. Gerwig, it seemed, had managed to make Barbie satisfyingly self-aware, likable and mockable; she called out the hypocrisy of the manufacturer -- Mattel -- while getting its blessing on the project. And then, somehow, she -- and the company -- marketed it all back to us.
"This sounds like a kick!" Ms. Faludi said, when I first suggested we might watch the movie together. She didn't want to be a feminist wet blanket on the whole thing, but she was prepared to deliver a sober report, should it be required. We settled into our seats. "You know, asking a feminist to comment on a Barbie movie is like asking the Wicked Witch of the West to critique Oz," she said with a laugh.
I was interested in Ms. Faludi's perspective because her interests seemed to track with the complexity at the heart of the "Barbie" movie. Last year, in the wake of the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, she wrote an essay bemoaning how feminists had made a Faustian bargain with popular culture. While we'd been wearing "Smash the patriarchy" T-shirts and leaning in at work while singing "Who run the world? (Girls)," Donald Trump had been packing the Supreme Court and gutting the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Feminism had become cool, fun -- and in the process had taken its eyes off the ball.
This seemed to make her an ideal viewing companion for a film that seemed the perfect distillation of these tensions: Could a movie currently fueling Barbiecore across America actually be a vehicle for a meaningful political message?
Of course, Ms. Faludi also understands the power of entertainment. In "Backlash," she traced not only how politics and the media had tried to undermine the gains of feminism but also how film and television did, too, through films like "Fatal Attraction" and "Misery," which turned women into man-eating she-devils or sad sacks fretting about their biological clocks.
I'll stop with her bona fides in a minute -- but after "Backlash," she went on to publish "Stiffed," about the breakdown of traditional masculinity and the crisis of the American male. Two and a half decades later, echoes of that book are everywhere -- from Richard Reeves to Andrew Tate -- and they show up in Ms. Gerwig's Ken, who struggles to find an identity apart from Barbie. (As the slogan goes: "She's everything. He's just Ken.") Ken turns Barbieland into a sweaty man cave after the real world teaches him about the notion of the patriarchy, a term that was used at least eight times in the movie.
"I mean, you couldn't write the script without 30 years of women's studies," Ms. Faludi said as the lights came up, and we emerged from the theater into a swirl of Barbie pink. She was dressed in all black, though she insisted her velvet top was actually more of a deep purple, selected because of its proximity to pink.
"It seems to me that a big theme underlying the movie is shock and horror over what happened to us -- what happened to women -- from 2016 on, with the double whammy of Trump and then Dobbs. And in particular, I thought abortion was the subtext to a lot."
Hold up.
She thought "Barbie" the movie -- with a series of choreographed dances, a ballad performed by Ryan Gosling and so much pink that there was a national paint shortage -- was actually not just subversive but ... about abortion?
Warning: Spoilers ahead.
Ms. Faludi explained her position. "I mean, it begins with little girls playing with dolls learning the origin story of Barbie -- and the rejection of the idea that women can just be mothers. It ends with her going to the gynecologist."
Indeed, Barbie begins with a homage to Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey," with little girls playing with baby dolls -- which, as the narrator explains, were the only dolls available to girls back then. So when Barbie -- an adult doll -- comes along, it's an epiphany: There's more to life than motherhood! The girls smash the baby dolls.
It ends with Barbie in the real world, in pink Birkenstocks and a blazer, heading to what appears to be a job interview, except, we learn, it's actually the gynecologist. (Ostensibly, now that Barbie is a human, she has a vagina instead of her infamous nongenitals.)
Ms. Faludi went on to outline a series of other allusions to our present moment:
In an early montage introducing viewers to Barbieland, lawyer Barbie speaks before the Supreme Court about the idea of personhood -- "which immediately made me think of attempts to create the unborn as 'persons,"' Ms. Faludi said.
Later, the Kens attempt to change the Constitution, amid Barbie lamenting how hard they had worked to create Barbieland: "You can't just undo it in a day." (To which Ken responds, "Literally -- and figuratively -- watch me.") Ms. Faludi's take? "I mean, that's what happened on Election Day of 2016."
We see the Kens band together in a kind of hunky beach army, trying to occupy Barbieland (when not performing choreographed ballads), with Ken adopting a mink fur cape that did not not resemble the one worn by the QAnon shaman during the Jan. 6 uprising.
And then there's Midge, the doll once marketed as Barbie's best friend, and the one pregnant doll in the Barbie universe, before she was discontinued. (You could remove Midge's belly and baby intact from her body and then magnetically reattach it. It was weird.) Midge and her bump are in the film, too, repeatedly -- a ghost that the fictional Mattel executives, and everyone else, just wish would go away. She's there for laughs, but squint hard enough, Ms. Faludi suggested, and you could also see her as "the specter of Dobbs."
We are back at her house now, drinking Aperol and soda -- "It's sort of pink, right?" she said -- in honor of "Barbie," prepared by Ms. Faludi's husband, who has also cooked us dinner.
"Are you guys going to storyboard this?" he wanted to know.
Ms. Faludi was aware that parsing "Barbie" for answers about the state of feminism is slightly absurd. Or maybe it's not. At the center of the movie is a story about a daughter and a mother, played by America Ferrera. It is Ms. Ferrera's long monologue about the endlessly contradictory expectations of being a woman that deprograms the Barbies, who've been brainwashed into servitude by the Kens. On the opening day of "Barbie," the news was filled with the story of another mother and daughter, whose Facebook messages about administering the abortion pill had been seized by the authorities, resulting in a jail sentence for the girl and an upcoming sentencing for the mother.
"Barbie" offered not only some escape from that reality but also genuine catharsis. "Perhaps what's going on," Ms. Faludi wrote me in an email a few days after the screening, "is that women are finding a way to explore their anger about recent history without feeling like they have to drown themselves in the bathtub (in real water)."
What is it that they say -- disempower the patriarchy by laughing at it?
"Only Barbie could say, 'By giving voice to the cognitive dissonance required to be a woman under the patriarchy, you robbed it of its power!' and turn it into a laugh line," Ms. Faludi emailed.
Of course, she wasn't about to go out and buy her daughter a Barbie or anything. (She, like Barbie, doesn't have children.)
"When they come up with Radical Feminist Barbie, let me know. Valerie Solanas Barbie, anyone?"

G.M.'s Electric Vehicle Rollout Delayed by Slow Battery Production: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company is earning big profits on gasoline cars and trucks but is struggling to catch up to Tesla in the fastest-growing segment of the auto market.
General Motors is investing tens of billions of dollars to produce new electric vehicles and, it hopes, catch up to Tesla.
But those ambitious goals appear distant. This year, the company is struggling to produce a new electric car battery pack meant for the electric vehicles it plans to introduce over several years.
On Tuesday, G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said the delays were "disappointing" and stemmed from a supplier's inability to deliver automated manufacturing machinery.
"We are working on multiple fronts to put this behind us," she said in a conference call with analysts.
Many investors are increasingly worried about the company's plans because electric vehicles are the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry and are the most important piece of Ms. Barra's long-term strategy for G.M.
The company's share price was down 3.5 percent at the close of trading on Tuesday.
A big fear for investors is that G.M., Ford Motor and other large automakers stand to lose customers as more drivers buy battery-powered cars. In China, Europe and California, where electric vehicles account for a significant and growing share of new car sales, once dominant automakers like Volkswagen and Toyota have been losing market share to Tesla and Chinese automakers like BYD.
Two years ago, Ms. Barra said, G.M. aimed to double annual revenue by 2030, to about $ 280 billion. Much of the increased business is supposed to come from electric vehicles, and new revenue from software and services linked to those cars and trucks. The company has also set a goal of phasing out internal combustion models by 2035.
Right now, G.M. is "way behind where they should be," said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, a consulting firm. "If they're having trouble with the first wave of these new E.V.s, and if they can't roll them out, that's not good for the next wave of higher-volume models."
In the first half of this year, G.M. built just 50,000 electric vehicles, and about 80 percent were Chevrolet Bolts that use an older battery pack made by a supplier. In the United States, G.M. sold fewer than 2,800 vehicles that used its new, modular Ultium battery packs, which are made at an Ohio factory that the company owns with LG Energy Solution. Two other Ultium factories are under construction, in Tennessee and Michigan.
Ms. Barra said G.M. was sticking with a previous forecast that it would make 400,000 electric vehicles in North America from 2022 to 2024, and it is expected to make 100,000 in the second half of this year. But she did not repeat an earlier prediction that the company would make more than one million in 2025, most of which were supposed to use Ultium technology.
Ultium battery packs are made from Lego-like modules that can be combined in different sizes. By using them in many vehicles, from compact cars to large pickups, G.M. hopes to reap economies of scale and gain a cost advantage over other automakers.
G.M. had said it would stop making the Bolt, but Ms. Barra said the company now planned to update the car with Ultium technology.
For now, the sluggish electric vehicle rollout isn't hurting the company's bottom line. G.M. said on Tuesday that it made a profit of $ 2.6 billion from April to June, an increase of 52 percent from a year earlier. Revenue totaled $ 44.7 billion, up 25 percent.
G.M.'s chief financial officer, Paul Jacobson, said the company had benefited from higher prices and strong sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles in North America. The average price of the vehicles that G.M. sold in the second quarter was $ 52,000 -- about $ 1,600 more than in the first quarter of the year.
G.M. sold 833,000 cars and trucks in North America in the second quarter, a 26 percent increase from a year earlier. In the rest of the world, it sold 147,000 vehicles, about 8,000 fewer than a year earlier.
Mr. Jacobson also said G.M. now expected to earn $ 9.3 billion to $ 10.7 billion this year, up from a previous target of $ 8.4 billion to $ 9.9 billion. The company also expects to reduce costs by $ 3 billion by the end of 2024, $ 1 billion more than an earlier forecast.
The company could struggle to hit its financial targets this year if the United Auto Workers go on strike. The company's contract with the U.A.W. ends in September and management and union officials recently started negotiating a new deal. The union has taken a more aggressive posture to the talks under a new president, Shawn Fain.
G.M. currently offers only a few vehicles that use Ultium batteries. They include the Cadillac Lyriq, an S.U.V.; the GMC Hummer, which has a starting price of about $ 90,0000; and large delivery vans made by a new division called BrightDrop.
This summer and fall, G.M. is supposed to add three electric Chevrolets -- the Blazer and Equinox S.U.V.s and an electric Silverado pickup. The company had previously said the Silverado would go on sale in the spring, but the truck is now not expected until the fall.

Heat Waves Stifle 3 Continents as Climate Change Warms the Globe: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Across North America, Europe and Asia, hundreds of millions of people endured blistering conditions. The U.S. special envoy for climate change called it "a threat to all of humankind."
Punishing heat waves gripped three continents on Tuesday, breaking records in cities around the Northern Hemisphere less than two weeks after the Earth recorded what scientists said were likely its hottest days in modern history.
Firefighters in Greece scrambled to put out wildfires, as parched conditions raised the risk of more blazes throughout Europe. Beijing logged another day of 95-degree heat, and people in Hangzhou, another Chinese city, compared the choking conditions to a sauna. From the Middle East to the American Southwest, delivery drivers, airport workers and construction crews labored under blistering skies. Those who could stay indoors did.
The temperatures, afflicting so much of the world all at once, were a withering reminder that climate change is a global crisis, driven by human-made forces: the emissions of heat-trapping gases, mainly caused by the burning of fossil fuels.
John Kerry, the U.S. special envoy for climate change, sought to coordinate some of the global response with the Chinese premier in Beijing, as a heat wave clutched a huge swath of China.
"The world really is looking to us for that leadership, particularly on the climate issue," Mr. Kerry told Chinese officials. "Climate, as you know, is a global issue, not a bilateral issue. It's a threat to all of humankind."
The planet has warmed about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the 19th century and will continue to grow hotter until humans essentially stop burning coal, oil and gas, scientists say. The warmer temperatures contribute to extreme weather events and help make periods of extreme heat more frequent, longer and more intense.
Also affecting this year's conditions is the return of El Niño, a cyclical weather pattern that, depending on the sea surface temperature and the pressure of the air above it, can originate in the Pacific and have wide-ranging effects on weather around the world.
For hundreds of millions of people on Tuesday, the heat was hard to escape. In the United States, Phoenix broke a nearly half-century-old record on Tuesday, with the city's 19th consecutive day of temperatures above 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 Celsius). Elsewhere around the country, hot and humid conditions were expected to worsen along the Gulf Coast and throughout the Southeast.
Wildfires raged on for yet another week in Canada, having burned a staggering 25 million acres so far this year, an area roughly the size of Kentucky. With more than a month of peak fire season to go, 2023 has already eclipsed Canada's annual record, from 1989.
Fires also forced evacuations in villages south, west and north of Athens, burning an estimated 7,400 acres of forest in Greece despite aerial water bombardments to bring the blazes under control.
"We've had fires, we have them now and we'll have them in the future, and this is one of the consequences of the climate crisis that we are living with ever greater intensity," Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a statement.
Mr. Mitsotakis cut short a trip to meet European leaders in Brussels in order to oversee the firefighting. The Greek authorities, who opened air-conditioned venues in Athens to offer some relief, are also expected to restrict access to the Acropolis to cooler morning and afternoon hours, as they did last weekend after a tourist collapsed.
In many European cities, officials have introduced cooling stations. And mindful of the danger -- more than 61,000 people died in last summer's heat waves in Europe, according to a recent study -- they have urged visitors and residents alike to stay indoors during the day's hottest hours.
In Rome, where the temperatures surpassed 100 Fahrenheit (37.8 Celsius) on Tuesday, officials mobilized a task force to hand out water and help people suffering from heat stress at sites like the Colosseum and outdoor markets.
The Japanese authorities, similarly, have rushed to help people suffering from the heat: At a festival in Kyoto on Monday, nine people, ranging in age from 8 to more than 80, were taken to a hospital as temperatures neared 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In Toyota City in Aichi Prefecture, where the temperature hit more than 102 degrees Fahrenheit, the regional board of education urged 415 elementary and middle schools to cancel gym classes and outdoor activities.
And in China, where a series of heat waves have seared the country since late June, Beijing and other cities have recorded day after day of heat over 90 degrees.
Power stations, in turn, have broken records for generating electricity, according to the official China Energy News -- burning more coal to meet demand for cooling. China uses considerable solar, wind and hydro power, but still relies on coal for three-fifths of its electricity. Some internet users in two provinces, Guangdong and Sichuan, reported scattered blackouts this week; state media, which tends to be slow to acknowledge power problems, has been silent about blackouts.
A remote town in northwestern China on Sunday reported the highest temperature ever recorded in that country -- 52.2 Celsius, or 126 Fahrenheit.
For millions of people in South and Southeast Asia, the stifling heat began long before the summer. India recorded the hottest February in its history, then endured high temperatures in April, when 11 people died of heat stroke on a single day, and again in May and June. Monsoon rains cooled temperatures across the country only in recent weeks.
Even regions where high heat is normal -- and where those who can afford to barely venture outside in the summer -- have been experiencing extremes.
At Persian Gulf International Airport on Iran's southwestern coast, the heat index -- which measures how hot it really feels outside based on both temperature and humidity -- hit an extraordinary high of 152 degrees Fahrenheit (66.7 Celsius) at 12:30 p.m. on Sunday, according to weather data. The combination of 104-degree heat and soaked air, with 65 percent humidity, pushed conditions at the airport beyond what scientists have said humans can normally withstand.
In Death Valley National Park in California, the thermometer read just over 128 degrees (53 Celsius) on Sunday.
It was in Death Valley, the 3,000-square-mile stretch of the Mojave Desert along the California-Nevada border, where the highest temperature was ever recorded on earth, according to the World Meteorological Organization. In 1913 in Furnace Creek, Calif., the temperature reached 134 degrees Fahrenheit, or 56.6 Celsius.
In recent years, thermometers there have come close, hitting 130 degrees Fahrenheit in 2020 and 2021, and forecasters warned it could near the mark again this summer. But this week at least, the National Weather Service forecast that temperatures in the national park should ease, relatively speaking, to 122 to 125 degrees Fahrenheit.

America Can't Build a Green Economy Without China: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Roughly a century ago, when Henry Ford revolutionized modern car production, engineers from France, Japan, Germany and the Soviet Union flocked to Detroit to learn how to copy his miraculous methods. Ford's River Rouge plant, then the world's largest factory, ultimately inspired facilities by Renault, Volkswagen, Toyota and the Russian automaker Gaz. It also gave rise to the nightmarish wartime economies of World War II, when tanks, planes and toxic chemicals rolled off assembly lines worldwide.
Those engineers weren't in Detroit just out of curiosity. They knew they had to catch up to American methods. As one Weimar conservative said, Germany had to "study the means and mechanisms of the Americans" or become "America's prey."
Now, America is in its own game of economic catch-up -- in the booming area of clean energy. As of this year, China is the world's largest car exporter -- thanks to a surging electric vehicle industry -- and it commands at least 74 percent market share in each step of the solar panel supply chain. China learned to master the solar, battery and electric vehicle industries through the 2010s, while the United States was debating whether to pass clean-energy policy -- and even whether climate change existed at all. With the Inflation Reduction Act, the United States now has an opportunity to become more competitive, and nothing gets lawmakers from across the political spectrum pumped up faster than the prospect of crushing China.
But the United States cannot build a competitive renewable or electric vehicle industry from scratch. The history of innovation -- and of the modern world, frankly -- shows that American engineers will progress in these industries only when they can work with their Chinese counterparts.
Look no further than the pickle Ford is in now. By 2026, Ford wants to start selling electric vehicles outfitted with batteries made of a chemical cocktail known as L.F.P. -- lithium, iron, and phosphate -- to the American market. L.F.P. batteries can be charged more quickly and more often than the cobalt and nickel batteries that Ford uses today; they're also cheaper and more rugged and the minerals are easier to source.
The only problem: Ford doesn't know how to make L.F.P. batteries on a large scale. No American company does. Although Americans first invented and developed L.F.P. technology, back in the 1990s, Chinese companies were the ones that figured out how to produce it at scale. Today, Chinese companies essentially have a monopoly.
But Ford has a solution. In February, it announced plans to open a new $ 3.5 billion L.F.P. battery factory in Michigan. It would license the technology from a Chinese battery maker, whose engineers would -- in the words of Bill Ford, the automaker's chairman -- "help us get up to speed so that we can build these batteries ourselves." It seemed like a win-win: The Chinese company, CATL, would get cash and prestige; Ford would learn how to make these batteries; and America would get 2,500 new manufacturing jobs. This was, apparently, exactly the kind of situation that President Biden's climate law was meant to set up.
Yet Senator Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who helped shape the law, exploded at the news. "I'll be damned if I'm going to give them $ 900 out of $ 7,500, to let it go to China for basically a product we started," he told an energy conference in Houston. (He was referring to the subsidy that the law grants to buyers of new electric vehicles, though Ford says none of that federal money would go to the Chinese company.)
"You're telling me we don't have the smart people and the technology, and we can't get up to speed quick enough?" he asked. "That doesn't make sense."
Republicans, too, blanched at the partnership. Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, who had once angled to win the factory for his state, abruptly withdrew his proposal and criticized the project as a "Trojan horse relationship with the Chinese Communist Party." Senator Marco Rubio of Florida demanded that the Treasury Department evaluate the deal as a national security risk.
But for all the overheated rhetoric, the truth is that free-flowing, in-person collaboration has been the fundamental mode of how technology moves across borders. With few exceptions, you either let yourself learn from your competitors or you fail to compete with them at all.
Other countries understand this. It is the United States that has had to learn this lesson again and again.
We learned it first in the 1910s, when Germany had the world's greatest chemical industry. American chemical companies had to wait until after World War I to bring German scientists to the United States so that DuPont and Dow could learn to make chemicals as good as their German competitors'.
We learned this lesson again in the 1980s when the Reagan administration pushed Japanese automakers to open factories with their American counterparts -- which allowed American engineers to better understand the superior manufacturing model the Japanese had developed. Those initial factories were such a success -- in one, labor input dropped to 19 hours per vehicle from 36 hours -- that the model was adopted across the industry and the world.
As American engineers began to work with their Japanese counterparts, they marveled at how certain ideas and approaches eluded them until they could see the Japanese do it themselves. "Toyota instructs implicitly," a business-school professor observed. "They cannot tell you in words what they are doing, not even in Japanese."
In industry after industry, it is a similar story. To describe the crucial information that can't be written down in a book or described in a patent, social scientists use the term "tacit knowledge." We can use a simpler term: know-how.
Know-how is what makes our modern, technical society work. Doing surgery, refining a dangerous chemical or manufacturing a lithium-ion battery -- they all require know-how.
Anyone can buy a machine tool on the global market, but only with know-how can you use it well and deploy it on an assembly line efficiently.
And know-how is why Ford has, at last, sought out the Chinese company. Sure, Ford's engineers can study the chemistry of these more advanced batteries, but that won't help to make them, any more than memorizing the N.F.L. rule book would make you Tom Brady. China is, for now, the world's No. 1 maker of electric vehicle batteries. Only its engineers can show Ford's engineers how to produce them in a fast, reliable way -- and at a globally competitive price. That's true in all the other green industries, too.
Mr. Manchin and Mr. Rubio may find ways to discourage this kind of partnership. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, electric vehicle batteries produced by a "foreign entity of concern" are ineligible for the $ 7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. Although the meaning of that phrase remains unclear, one possible interpretation suggests that virtually any firm subject to Chinese law might be forbidden -- meaning that even if Ford produced every part of a car in the United States, the Chinese company's involvement might still disqualify the car's buyer from receiving the $ 7,500 tax credit.
But rejecting Chinese know-how would make us, ironically, more dependent on China in any future security-related rupture -- because we will simply have to import from China what we never learned to make ourselves.
This is the kind of conundrum that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had to navigate during her recent trip to China -- and that federal officials must negotiate for years to come. If American companies can't open factories with Chinese ones in the United States, then the country's workers will miss out on jobs, its consumers won't get new technology and its engineers will fall behind the world's best. Competing with China is a good idea. Being so suspicious of it that you trip over your own feet isn't.

Air Taxis May Finally Get Clearance to Fly: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Federal regulators released a plan that would allow a new generation of small aircraft to transport people short distances.
For years, flying taxis have represented an exciting but distant dream, fueled in part by industry hype. Now they have a rollout plan and a target arrival date: 2028.
In a document published on Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration outlined the steps that it and others need to take to usher in a competitive air taxi market in at least one location by 2028 with limited operations starting as early as 2025. The vehicles look like small airplanes or helicopters and can take off and land vertically, allowing them to operate from the middle of cities, whisking people to airports or vacation destinations like the Hamptons in New York or Cape Cod in Massachusetts.
The F.A.A.'s plan is notable because it reflects confidence that the technology is only a few years away, and because it comes from the agency that will oversee certification of the aircraft as well as the rules that pilots and companies must follow.
"These things will be coming on the scene, and our job is to try and be ahead of the curve," said Paul Fontaine, an assistant F.A.A. administrator who oversees the modernization of the air transportation system. The plan is intended to serve as a guide for introducing the aircraft in a way that is predictable and routine, the agency said.
Creating the conditions for air taxis to zip above one or more cities by 2028 will be no small task, and aircraft manufacturers will need the help of many others besides the F.A.A., including other federal agencies and state and local governments.
Air taxis are likely to face resistance from local officials and residents who fear that they will be safety hazards or a nuisance. Legislation and lawsuits seeking to block their use in cities and neighborhoods could set up pitched battles.
But first the aircraft must be certified. Many are designed to be fully electric, though some could be powered by hydrogen or a combination of jet fuels and batteries. The aircraft are still under development by various companies and can carry only a handful of passengers. They also contain an array of new technologies and systems, many of which will have to be individually certified to meet the F.A.A.'s standards.
"With a lot of new aircraft technology, you bring on one very novel thing and you work your way through that," said Pat Anderson, a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and a co-founder of VerdeGo Aero, a hybrid air taxi company. "In these vehicles, we're trying to bring many, many things forward, all at once."
Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation are among the U.S. air taxi companies furthest along in that certification process, and both hope to have certified aircraft and start commercial services in 2025, ahead of the F.A.A.'s 2028 goal. To achieve their targets, they will have to win the approval of the federal agency and local officials for specific services and routes.
But air taxi companies have had to delay such plans in the past. In 2017, Uber said it was working on electric air taxis that would conduct passenger flights by 2020. Instead, that was the year Uber sold its air taxi unit to Joby, which said at the time that service could begin "as early as 2023."
Even traditional airplanes made by manufacturers with decades of experience, such as Boeing and Airbus, often face long certification delays. And F.A.A. officials said they would not compromise safety to meet the 2028 target.
Limits on battery capacity mean the distance that many air taxis can fly will be restricted. As a result, the aircraft will probably first be used to transport people in cities to nearby airports -- a service that some companies already offer with helicopters in cities like New York.
Air taxi companies will have to compete for scarce real estate, navigate city and state regulations, develop the infrastructure to charge or fuel aircraft, and gain acceptance from residents. They will also have to hire and train pilots, who are in high demand.
Still, the F.A.A.'s plan underscores a growing belief among industry analysts and executives that the necessary elements are coming together for air taxis to take off.
"People always ask me, 'Why is this happening now?"' said Adam Goldstein, the chief executive of Archer. "It's the tech, the regulation and the money that allowed us get here."
The F.A.A. has been criticized for moving too slowly on certifying air taxis and other novel aircraft. In a June report, the Transportation Department's inspector general concluded that poor communication internally and externally could increase "the risk of certification and operational delays."
But the agency has been making some progress, recently updating a technical road map for rolling out air taxis in cities and publishing a proposed rule in June governing how air taxi pilots should be trained and certified.
Air taxi manufacturers have made technological strides, too, with several now regularly test-flying their aircraft.
Investors have taken notice. Several major air taxi companies have gone public in recent years, including Joby, Archer, Lilium in Germany and Vertical Aerospace in England. This year, Archer, Joby and Lilium raised more than $ 150 million each from investors.
Many of the companies have also deepened ties with major airlines or automakers. Stellantis, the automaker that owns Jeep, Peugeot and other brands, is helping to build a factory in Georgia for Archer, which has a tentative agreement to sell several hundred aircraft to United Airlines and Mesa Airlines. Joby has a close relationship with Toyota.
Boeing recently bought Wisk, which is working on an autonomous air taxi. And Embraer, a Brazilian company that makes smaller commercial planes, created its own air taxi company, Eve Air Mobility.
The businesses are all vying for a market that could someday be worth tens of billions of dollars. The aircraft might replace some trips that take place through Uber and Lyft. For airlines, air taxis could help them win over or maintain the loyalty of affluent passengers.
There are other opportunities, too. UPS is working with the air taxi maker Beta Technologies to test air taxis for cargo in the United Arab Emirates. Beta and Joby have also worked with the U.S. military.
The key to winning over the public will be making air taxis cheap enough that many people can use them, said Michael Huerta, a former F.A.A. administrator, who is now a director on the boards of Delta Air Lines and Joby.
"Over time, it will get larger public acceptance, but critical to that is going to be cost," he said. "If you see this only as a service for very wealthy people, and you're dealing with the impacts of it, you might be less accepting."

E.V. Prices Fall as Automakers Raise Production: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Ford, Tesla and other automakers are having to lower prices to lure buyers as the supply of battery-powered models begins to exceed demand.
After struggling to find enough batteries and other parts for the past couple of years, automakers are finally beginning to churn out large numbers of electric cars and trucks. More than 30 new models will arrive in showrooms this year.
What they need now are more customers.
While sales of electric vehicles are increasing -- they climbed about 48 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier -- they are not rising fast enough to keep pace with the number of vehicles rolling off assembly lines. And inventories of unsold vehicles are starting to pile up.
More than 90,000 battery-powered cars and trucks are sitting on dealer lots, four times as many as a year ago, according to Cox Automotive, a market research firm. That's enough to last 103 days at the current rate of sales, compared with about 50 days for the industry as a whole.
Manufacturers "are having a 'Field of Dreams' moment," said Jonathan Gregory, a senior manager of economic and industry insight at Cox. "They have built E.V. inventory, but now they wait for buyers to come."
In view of this unbalanced supply and demand, automakers are cutting prices and offering more incentives. On Monday, Ford Motor reduced prices of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck by $ 6,000 to nearly $ 10,000, or as much as 17 percent on some versions. The company is also offering discounted interest rates of 1.9 percent to 3.9 percent on certain loans for Lightning purchases.
These moves follow several rounds of price cuts by Tesla, the dominant seller of electric cars. Tesla's price reductions earlier prompted Ford to lower prices of its Mustang Mach-E electric sport utility vehicle, although that hasn't brought Mach-E inventory back in line with sales.
At the end of June, Ford dealers had 16,400 of that model in stock -- about 2,000 more than they sold in the first six months of the year.
While many consumers express interest in electric vehicles, they are often not ready to go through with a purchase. Many people have been put off by high prices of electric cars and are waiting for them to cost no more than comparable gasoline models -- something that could be hastened by recent price cuts.
Other car buyers have concerns about how far these cars and trucks can travel on a full charge. Many models now available need to be recharged after traveling 200 to 250 miles. Uncertainty about finding charging stations and how long it takes to charge the vehicles can put off some people.
Glenn Staub, a personal trainer from White Plains, N.Y., said he wanted to buy a hybrid or fully electric car because of the potential environmental benefits and the savings on fuel costs. But he's not going to be in the market until his 2014 Toyota Corolla conks out.
"My policy for keeping cars is I drive it until it's not serviceable anymore," he said. That might not be for a few years; his Corolla has been driven just under 100,000 miles and runs fine.
Sales have become particularly sluggish for high-priced luxury models -- a segment of the market that has a surfeit of options from the likes of Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Porsche and Lucid Motors. Many of these cars cost $ 75,000 to $ 160,000.
"I think there was a lot of hype about E.V.s, and people did their research and realized these are premium vehicles and they're not cheap," said Rick Ricart, president of Ricart Automotive, which owns nine new-car franchises in Dublin, Ohio. "And there's been some pullback."
Mr. Ricart said his family's Ford store had a top-of-the-line F-150 Lightning Platinum truck on sale for $ 92,000 for more than two months. "A year ago, it would have been sold by now," he said.
Another group of electric vehicles that are struggling to find buyers are those that no longer qualify for a $ 7,500 federal tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden's ambitious climate change law. The credit is available only on cars that are assembled in North America and that include a certain percentage of battery materials from the region or from U.S. trade partners.
In addition to those restrictions, electric sedans have to sell for $ 55,000 or less to be eligible for credits, and S.U.V.s, pickup trucks and vans have to sell for $ 80,000 or less.
Purchases of Ford's Lightning trucks can make buyers eligible for the $ 7,500 credit, and the company is planning to sell a lot more of the pickups in the coming months. The company temporarily halted production this year to upgrade its assembly line and increase output. By the fall, the company expects its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center near Detroit to be able to churn out 150,000 Lightnings a year, triple its current production capacity.
The company's decision to lower prices may also have something to do with the growing competition in the electric vehicle business. Tesla said on Saturday that it had started producing its much-delayed Cybertruck pickup, and General Motors is expected to soon begin delivering an electric version of the Chevrolet Silverado truck.
Ford began making the Lightning in spring 2022 and raised prices several times by a total of around $ 20,000, citing increasing cost of raw materials for its batteries. At the time, demand far outstripped Ford's production, and some dealers were charging thousands of dollars more than the company's suggested retail price.
"Shortly after launching the F-150 Lightning, rapidly rising material costs, supply constraints and other factors drove up the cost of the E.V. truck for Ford and our customers," Marin Gjaja, the chief customer officer for the automaker's electric vehicle division, said in a statement. "We've continued to work in the background to improve accessibility to help lower prices for our customers and shorten wait times."
The company's decision to cut prices unnerved investors who feared it would hurt Ford's profits, and its stock price fell 6 percent on Monday.
Ford said the Pro model of the F-150 Lightning now had a list price of $ 49,995, a reduction of $ 9,979. The XLT 312A model with an extended range battery was cut $ 8,879, to $ 69,995. The top-of-the-line Platinum extended-range model will sell for $ 91,995, or $ 6,079 less than its price last week.
As a result of price cuts, most Lightning models will cost less than $ 80,000, making them eligible for a $ 7,500 federal tax credit.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I get why the Biden administration is pushing electric vehicles so hard. To stop the planet from overheating, we'll eventually need motor vehicles to produce zero greenhouse gas emissions, and only fully electric vehicles can do that. Hybrids, which have combustion engines along with electric motors, will always puff some carbon dioxide (and other bad stuff) out of their tailpipes.
Right now, though, there's a good argument to be made that the government, and automakers, are leaning too hard into all-electric and neglecting the virtues of hybrid technology. When I first heard this counterintuitive argument from Toyota, I dismissed it as heel-dragging by a company that lags in electrics, but I've come around to the idea that hybrids -- at least for now -- do have a lot of advantages over all-electric vehicles.
Imagine some wheelbarrows filled with rocks. The rocks contain lithium, cobalt, manganese, nickel, graphite and other materials for lithium-ion batteries. By Toyota's calculation, the amount of rocks needed for one long-range electric vehicle would be enough for either six plug-in hybrids or 90 of the type of hybrid that can't be plugged in for a recharge. (Namely, the type whose batteries are recharged from the engine or from braking.)
"The overall carbon reduction of those 90 hybrids over their lifetimes is 37 times as much as a single battery electric vehicle," Toyota argues. That's a stunning statistic if true.
"People involved in the auto industry are largely a silent majority," Toyota's then chief executive, Akio Toyoda, told reporters on a trip to Thailand in December, according to The Wall Street Journal. "That silent majority is wondering whether E.V.s are really OK to have as a single option. But they think it's the trend so they can't speak out loudly."
Lobbying against an all-electric approach is what you might expect from an automaker that bet heavily on hydrogen fuel cells and hybrids and has only a sliver of the market in E.V.s that run on batteries. I have no doubt that Toyota is motivated at least in part by self-interest. But some people I spoke with who aren't connected with the company had similar views.
"Toyota's claim is accurate. We've crunched the numbers on this," Ashley Nunes told me. He is a senior research associate at Harvard Law School and the director for federal policy, climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute, a think tank. He testified on the topic in April before the House Subcommittee on Environment, Manufacturing and Critical Materials.
I'll speed through his points. Electric vehicles consume huge quantities of lithium and other materials because they have huge batteries. And they have huge batteries because customers suffer from "range anxiety" and won't buy an E.V. unless it can go for hundreds of miles without charging -- even though the vast majority of trips are short. The Nissan Leaf gets 149 miles with its standard battery, which seems like enough for most purposes, yet Nissan sold just 12,026 Leafs (Leaves?) last year.
Partly because of ever-bigger batteries, E.V.s are getting more expensive on average, not cheaper as was predicted. They are out of many buyers' price range. Some people will keep driving old ICE-mobiles (cars with internal combustion engines) because they can't afford an E.V. And those ICE-mobiles will continue to be major emitters of greenhouse gases.
The production of electric vehicles produces more greenhouse gases than the production of cars with combustion engines. So E.V.s have to travel between 28,000 and 68,000 miles before they have an emissions advantage over similarly sized and equipped ICE-mobiles, according to Nunes. That may take 10 years or more if the E.V. isn't driven much.
Then there's the problem of where to get all the minerals. Domestic production, even combined with extensive recycling, can't meet the need for cobalt, graphite, lithium and manganese, Nunes wrote in his prepared House testimony. Allies could help, but they're also ramping up consumption. "There is, to put it bluntly, only so much mineral supply to go around," he wrote. Lithium iron phosphate is a promising alternative battery chemistry, but its energy density is lower, so batteries would have to be even bigger to give the same range. (Sodium-ion batteries and solid-state lithium-ion batteries are other options.)
The Biden administration clearly doesn't trust electric vehicles to win over the buying public purely on their merits. That's why in April the Environmental Protection Agency proposed new rules to ensure that two-thirds of new passenger cars and a quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United States are all-electric by 2032.
That would be a wrenching change. It sometimes seems like E.V.s are everywhere, but in reality they accounted for just 5.8 percent of new cars sold in the United States last year, The Times reported. All-electric trucks accounted for less than 2 percent of new heavy trucks.
Of course, drivers could be bribed into buying E.V.s if enough money were thrust in their faces. But Nunes said that greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced far more cost-effectively through subsidies of clean power generation, particularly wind turbines.
For another perspective, I exchanged emails with Nafisa Lohawala, a Ph.D. economist who is a fellow at Resources for the Future, a think tank. She focused on the benefits of plug-in hybrids, which use less metal than all-electric E.V.s but more than non-pluggable hybrids. "From consumers' perspective," she wrote, "having a gasoline backup helps alleviate range anxiety, allowing them to adopt plug-in hybrids even when the charging network around them is sparse. Moreover, given their lower price, middle- and low-income communities would also find adopting them easier than battery electric vehicles."
Lohawala wrote that if drivers recharge their plug-in hybrids frequently, they'll be able to run on battery power almost all the time and emissions will be almost as low as with an all-electric E.V. That will tend to happen as more charging stations with faster chargers are installed. "As long as the battery ranges of plug-in hybrids are reasonably long and the electricity prices are low, consumers would voluntarily charge them rather than relying on gasoline," she wrote.
Again, I get that climate change is an existential crisis. (Take it from my Opinion colleague, David Wallace-Wells.) I also get that hybrids aren't as clean as all-electric E.V.s. "The fact is: A hybrid today is not green technology," Katherine García, the director of the Clean Transportation for All Campaign, wrote last year. "The Prius hybrid runs on a pollution-emitting combustion engine found in any gas-powered car."
However, getting to the destination of all-electric for all will take more minerals, better battery chemistry and more and better chargers, among other things. That's a big project. For now, hybrids seem like a valuable part of the vehicle mix.
The Readers Write
Amazon is in a world of hurt. They entered an established category (groceries) with entrenched competitors, including Walmart. I like to compare the position Amazon is in to that of the French forces at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. The French thought they had a superior army. The Viet Minh placed their focus on having a superior strategy. The French forces had to surrender.

New-Car Sales Take Off As Chip Shortage Eases: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: General Motors, Toyota and other automakers sold more trucks and sport utility vehicles as supply chain problems eased and demand remained strong despite rising interest rates.
Some of the country's biggest automakers reported big sales increases for the second quarter on Wednesday, the strongest sign yet that the auto industry was bouncing back from parts shortages and overcoming the effects of higher interest rates.
General Motors, the largest U.S. automaker, said it sold 691,978 vehicles from April to June, up 19 percent from a year earlier. It was the company's highest quarterly total in more than two years.
Automakers have struggled in the last two years with a shortage of computer chips that forced factory shutdowns and left dealers with few vehicles to sell. More recently, rising interest rates have made auto loans more expensive, causing some consumers to defer purchases or opt for used vehicles.
"I'm not saying we are on the cusp of exciting growth here," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, a research firm. "But we are now at a turning point where the auto market returns to more balance. It's the beginning of returning to normal."
The easing of chip shortages has allowed automakers to restock dealer lots, making it easier for car buyers to find the models and features they want, Mr. Smoke said. At the end of June, dealers had about 1.8 million vehicles in stock, nearly 800,000 more than at the same point in 2022, according to Cox data.
Sales have also been helped by strong job creation and rising wages, Mr. Smoke said.
At the same time, however, higher interest rates and higher car prices have put new-car purchases out of reach of many consumers. In the first half of the year, the average price paid for a new vehicle was a near-record $ 48,564. The average interest rate paid on car loans in the first six months of 2023 was 7.09 percent, up from 4.86 percent a year earlier, according to Cox. The average monthly payment in the first half was $ 784, up from $ 691.
"Demand will be limited by the level of prices and rates, which are not likely to come down enough to stimulate more demand than the market can bear," Mr. Smoke said.
Cox estimated that total sales of new cars and trucks rose 11.6 percent in the first half of the year, to 7.65 million. The firm now expects full-year sales to top 15 million, which would be a rise of 8 percent.
Several automakers reported solid quarterly sales on Wednesday. Toyota said its U.S. sales rose 7 percent, to 568,962 cars and light trucks. Stellantis, the company that owns Jeep, Ram, Chrysler and other brands, reported a 6 percent rise, to 434,648 vehicles.
Honda, which had been severely hampered by chip shortages, said its sales rose 45 percent to 347,025 cars and trucks. Hyundai and Kia, the South Korean automakers, each sold more than 210,000 vehicles, posting gains of 14 percent and 15 percent.
Electric vehicles remain the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry. Rivian, a maker of electric pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, said on Monday that it delivered 12,640 in the second quarter, a 59 percent jump from a year earlier. And on Sunday, Tesla reported an 83 percent jump in global sales in the second quarter.
Cox estimated that more than 500,000 electric vehicles were sold in the United States in the first six months of the year, and that more than one million would be sold in 2023, setting a record for battery-powered cars and trucks in the country.
Tesla, which does not break out its sales by country, remains the largest seller of E.V.s in the U.S. market. Cox estimated that the company sold more than 161,000 electric cars in the second quarter in the United States. Ford Motor, which offers three fully electric models., reports its quarterly sales on Thursday.
G.M. sold more 15,300 battery-powered cars and trucks, but nearly 14,000 were the Chevrolet Bolt, a smaller vehicle that the company will stop making at the end of the year. The company also sold 1,348 Cadillac Lyriq electric S.U.V.s and 47 GMC Hummer pickup trucks. Chevrolet will soon start delivering a new electric Silverado pickup truck, which uses the same battery technology as the Lyriq and Hummer.

Lithium Scarcity Has Carmakers Scrambling Into Mining Industry: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Eager to avoid falling further behind Tesla and Chinese car companies, many Western auto executives are bypassing traditional suppliers and committing billions of dollars on deals with lithium mining companies.
They are showing up in hard hats and steel-toed boots to scope out mines in places like Chile, Argentina, Quebec and Nevada to secure supplies of a metal that could make or break their companies as they move from gasoline to battery power.
Without lithium, U.S. and European carmakers won't be able to build batteries for the electric pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and sedans they need to remain competitive. And assembly lines they are ramping up in places like Michigan, Tennessee and Saxony, Germany, will grind to a halt.
Established mining companies don't have enough lithium to supply the industry as electric vehicle sales soar. General Motors plans for all its car sales to be electric by 2035. In the first quarter of 2023, sales of battery-powered cars, pickups and sport utility vehicles in the United States rose 45 percent from a year earlier, according to Kelley Blue Book.
So car companies are scrambling to lock up exclusive access to smaller mines before others swoop in. But the strategy exposes them to the risky, boom-and-bust business of mining, sometimes in politically unstable countries with weak environmental protections. If they bet incorrectly, automakers could end up paying far more for lithium than it might sell for in a few years.
Auto executives said they had no choice because there weren't sufficient reliable supplies of lithium and other battery materials, like nickel and cobalt, for the millions of electric vehicles the world needs.
In the past, automakers let battery suppliers buy lithium and other raw material on their own. But lithium shortages have forced carmakers, which have deeper pockets, to directly acquire the essential metal and have it sent to battery factories, some owned by suppliers and others owned partly or fully by the automakers. Batteries rely on lightweight lithium ions to conduct energy.
"We quickly realized there wasn't an established value chain that would support our ambitions for the next 10 years," said Sham Kunjur, who oversees General Motors' program to secure battery materials.
The automaker last year struck a supply deal with Livent, a lithium company in Philadelphia, for material from South American mines. And in January, G.M. agreed to invest $ 650 million in Lithium Americas, a company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, to develop the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada. The company beat out 50 bidders, including battery and component makers, for that stake, said Mr. Kunjur and Lithium Americas executives.
Ford Motor has made lithium deals with SQM, a Chilean supplier; Albemarle, based in Charlotte, N.C.; and Nemaska Lithium of Quebec.
"These are some of the largest lithium producers in the world with the best quality," Lisa Drake, vice president for electric vehicle industrialization at Ford, told investors in May.
The deals that automakers are striking with mining companies and raw material processors hark back to the beginnings of the industry, when Ford set up rubber plantations in Brazil to secure material for tires.
"It almost seems like 100 years later, with this new revolution, we are back to that stage," Mr. Kunjur said.
Establishing a supply chain for lithium will be expensive: $ 51 billion, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a consulting firm. To benefit from U.S. subsidies, battery raw materials must be mined and processed in North America or by trade allies.
But intense competition for the metal has helped inflate lithium prices to unsustainable levels, some executives said.
"Since the start of '22 the price of lithium has gone up so quickly and there was so much hype in the system, there were a lot of really bad deals that one could do," said R.J. Scaringe, chief executive of Rivian, an electric vehicle company in Irvine, Calif.
Dozens of companies are developing mines, and there may eventually be more than enough lithium to meet everybody's needs. Global production could surge sooner than expected, leading to a collapse in the price of lithium, something that has happened in the recent past. That would leave automakers paying a lot more for the metal than it was worth.
Auto executives are taking no chances, fearing that if they go even a few years without sufficient lithium their companies will never catch up.
Their fears have merit. In places where electric vehicle sales have grown the fastest, established automakers have lost a lot of ground. In China, where almost one-third of new cars are electric, Volkswagen, G.M. and Ford have lost market share to domestic producers like BYD, which manufacturers its own batteries. And Tesla, which has built a supply chain for lithium and other raw materials over years, has steadily gained market share in China, Europe and the United States. It is now the second-largest seller of all new cars in California after Toyota.
Chinese companies often have an edge over U.S. and European car companies because they are state owned or state supported, and, as a result, can take more risks in mining, which often encounters local opposition, nationalization by populist governments or technical difficulties.
In June, the Chinese battery maker CATL completed an agreement with Bolivia to invest $ 1.4 billion in two lithium projects. Few Western companies have shown sustained interest in the country, known for its political instability.
With a few exceptions, Western carmakers have avoided buying stakes in lithium mines. Instead, they are negotiating agreements in which they promise to buy a certain amount of lithium within a price range.
Often the deals give carmakers preferential access, crowding out rivals. Tesla has a deal with Piedmont Lithium, which is near Charlotte, that ensures the carmaker a large portion of the output from a mine in Quebec.
Lithium is abundant but not always easy to extract.
Many countries with big reserves, like Bolivia, Chile and Argentina, have nationalized natural resources or have stringent currency exchange controls that can limit the ability of foreign investors to withdraw money from the country. Even in Canada and the United States, it can take years to establish mines.
"Lithium is going to be tough to get and to fully electrify here in the U.S.," said Eric Norris, president of the Lithium global business unit at Albemarle, the leading American lithium miner.
As a result, auto executives and consultants are fanning out to mines around the world, most of which have not begun producing.
"There's a bit of desperation,," said Amanda Hall, chief executive of Summit Nanotech, a Canadian start-up working on technology to hasten extraction of lithium from saline groundwater. Auto executives, she said, are "trying to get ahead of the problem."
Yet, in their hurry, car companies are making deals with small mines that may not live up to expectations. "There are a lot of examples of problems that come up," said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity fund focused on investing in sustainable transportation. Lithium prices could eventually collapse from overproduction, she said.
The miners appear to be the big winners. Their deals with the car companies typically assure them fat profits and make it easier for them to borrow money or sell shares.
Rio Tinto, one of the world's largest mining companies, recently reached a preliminary agreement to supply lithium to Ford from a mine it was developing in Argentina.
Ford was one of several car companies that expressed interest, said Marnie Finlayson, managing director of Rio Tinto's battery minerals business. Rio Tinto takes car company representatives through a checklist, she said, that covers mining methods, relations with local communities and environmental impact "to get everyone comfortable."
"Because if we can't do that, then the supply is not going to be unlocked, and we're not going to solve this global challenge together," Ms. Finlayson said, referring to climate change.
Until a few years ago, the price of lithium was so low mining it was hardly profitable. But now with the growing popularity of electric vehicles, there are dozens of proposed mines. Most are in early development stages and will take years to begin production.
Until 2021, "there was either no capital or very short-term capital," said Ana Cabral-Gardner, co-chief executive of Sigma Lithium, a Vancouver-based company that is producing lithium in Brazil. "No one was looking at a five-year horizon and a 10-year horizon."
Auto companies are playing an important role in helping mines get up and running, said Dirk Harbecke, chief executive of Rock Tech Lithium, which is developing a mine in Ontario and a processing plant in eastern Germany that will supply Mercedes-Benz.
"I do not think that this is a risky strategy," Mr. Harbecke said. "I think it's a necessary strategy."

“It almost seems like 100 years later, with this new revolution, we are back to that stage,” Kunjur said.
Establishing a supply chain for lithium will be expensive: $51 billion, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a consulting firm. To benefit from U.S. subsidies, battery raw materials must be mined and processed in North America or by trade allies.
But intense competition for the metal has helped inflate lithium prices to unsustainable levels, some executives said.
“Since the start of ’22 the price of lithium has gone up so quickly and there was so much hype in the system, there were a lot of really bad deals that one could do,” said R.J. Scaringe, CEO of Rivian, an electric vehicle company in Irvine, California.
Dozens of companies are developing mines, and there may eventually be more than enough lithium to meet everybody’s needs. Global production could surge sooner than expected, leading to a collapse in the price of lithium, something that has happened in the recent past. That would leave automakers paying a lot more for the metal than it was worth.
Auto executives are taking no chances, fearing that if they go even a few years without sufficient lithium their companies will never catch up.
Their fears have merit. In places where electric vehicle sales have grown the fastest, established automakers have lost a lot of ground. In China, where almost one-third of new cars are electric, Volkswagen, GM and Ford have lost market share to domestic producers like BYD, which manufacturers its own batteries. And Tesla, which has built a supply chain for lithium and other raw materials over years, has steadily gained market share in China, Europe and the United States. It is now the second-largest seller of all new cars in California after Toyota.
Chinese companies often have an edge over U.S. and European car companies because they are state owned or state supported, and, as a result, can take more risks in mining, which often encounters local opposition, nationalization by populist governments or technical difficulties.
In June, Chinese battery maker CATL completed an agreement with Bolivia to invest $1.4 billion in two lithium projects. Few Western companies have shown sustained interest in the country, known for its political instability.
With a few exceptions, Western carmakers have avoided buying stakes in lithium mines. Instead, they are negotiating agreements in which they promise to buy a certain amount of lithium within a price range.
Often the deals give carmakers preferential access, crowding out rivals. Tesla has a deal with Piedmont Lithium, which is near Charlotte, that ensures the carmaker a large portion of the output from a mine in Quebec.
Lithium is abundant but not always easy to extract.
Many countries with big reserves, like Bolivia, Chile and Argentina, have nationalized natural resources or have stringent currency exchange controls that can limit the ability of foreign investors to withdraw money from the country. Even in Canada and the United States, it can take years to establish mines.
“Lithium is going to be tough to get and to fully electrify here in the U.S.,” said Eric Norris, president of the Lithium global business unit at Albemarle, the leading American lithium miner.
As a result, auto executives and consultants are fanning out to mines around the world, most of which have not begun producing.
“There’s a bit of desperation,” said Amanda Hall, CEO of Summit Nanotech, a Canadian startup working on technology to hasten extraction of lithium from saline groundwater. Auto executives, she said, are “trying to get ahead of the problem.”
Yet, in their hurry, car companies are making deals with small mines that may not live up to expectations. “There are a lot of examples of problems that come up,” said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity fund focused on investing in sustainable transportation. Lithium prices could eventually collapse from overproduction, she said.
The miners appear to be the big winners. Their deals with the car companies typically assure them fat profits and make it easier for them to borrow money or sell shares.
Rio Tinto, one of the world’s largest mining companies, recently reached a preliminary agreement to supply lithium to Ford from a mine it was developing in Argentina.
Ford was one of several car companies that expressed interest, said Marnie Finlayson, managing director of Rio Tinto’s battery minerals business. Rio Tinto takes car company representatives through a checklist, she said, that covers mining methods, relations with local communities and environmental impact “to get everyone comfortable.”
“Because if we can’t do that, then the supply is not going to be unlocked, and we’re not going to solve this global challenge together,” Finlayson said, referring to climate change.
Until a few years ago, the price of lithium was so low mining it was hardly profitable. But now with the growing popularity of electric vehicles, there are dozens of proposed mines. Most are in early development stages and will take years to begin production.
Until 2021, “there was either no capital or very short-term capital,” said Ana Cabral-Gardner, co-CEO of Sigma Lithium, a Vancouver, British Columbia-based company that is producing lithium in Brazil. “No one was looking at a five-year horizon and a 10-year horizon.”
Auto companies are playing an important role in helping mines get up and running, said Dirk Harbecke, CEO of Rock Tech Lithium, which is developing a mine in Ontario and a processing plant in eastern Germany that will supply Mercedes-Benz.
“I do not think that this is a risky strategy,” Harbecke said. “I think it’s a necessary strategy.”

Tesla Sales Are Up 10% As Perks Fuel Demand: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Incentives and price cuts made Tesla electric cars cheaper than comparable gasoline models. But the company faces growing competition in China, a key market.
Tesla sales rose a better-than-expected 10 percent in the second quarter as the company led by Elon Musk benefited from government incentives and price cuts that made its electric cars less expensive than comparable gasoline models.
Tesla delivered 466,000 vehicles from April through June, up from 423,000 vehicles in the previous quarter, the company said on Sunday. Compared with a year earlier, sales in the second quarter rose 83 percent as the company expanded production at new factories in Austin, Texas, and near Berlin.
The sales figures exceeded estimates by Wall Street analysts and showed that Tesla was able to overcome the effect of higher interest rates, which raise monthly payments for people who buy cars on credit.
Tesla was the first of the automakers to report its sales numbers. Sales of most major car brands probably rose sharply in the last quarter, analysts say. Supply chain issues have improved, making it easier for carmakers to get the components they need and for buyers to find the cars they want. Analysts at Cox Automotive forecast that U.S. new vehicle sales will rise more than 8 percent this year from 2022.
Rules that took effect this year allowed buyers of Tesla vehicles to qualify for $ 7,500 in federal tax credits. With the credit, the least expensive Model 3 sedan sells for less than $ 33,000, cheaper than similar luxury sedans sold by Mercedes-Benz and BMW that run on gasoline and in line with mass market cars like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.
Owners of electric cars also benefit from fuel savings and lower maintenance costs. Electric vehicles don't require oil changes, and electricity is generally cheaper per mile than gasoline.
Tesla is the dominant maker of electric cars in the United States, with a market share of 62 percent in the first quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book. But its share has slipped from more than 70 percent at the beginning of 2022 as established automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen have begun offering more electric models.
In China, a bigger car market than the United States or Europe, Tesla faces intense competition from local manufacturers that have newer model lineups, like BYD. On average, electric vehicles by Chinese manufacturers have been in showrooms a bit more than a year, according to AlixPartners, a consulting firm. Tesla's most popular car, the Model Y sport utility vehicle, went on sale in 2020.
Chinese manufacturers also offer interior and exterior styling and entertainment and information systems that better cater to local tastes, AlixPartners noted, citing consumer surveys.
While Tesla sales have continued to climb, the company's profitability has suffered because it has had to cut prices to prop up demand. Tesla made $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter, down from $ 3.7 billion in the last three months of 2022.
Many investors are betting that Tesla's growth will accelerate as demand for electric vehicles grows, and the company begins selling the Cybertruck, an electric pickup truck, later this year. Tesla's agreement to let other carmakers, including Ford and G.M., use its charging network could also become a new source of revenue.
Tesla's share price has more than doubled this year although it remains well below its peak in 2021, when the company was worth more than $ 1 trillion.
The carmaker said on Sunday that it would publish its financial results for this year's second quarter on July 19.

Trade Deficit in Goods Narrows as Imports Fall
The U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed in May as imports fell, but the improvement was probably insufficient to prevent trade from being a drag on economic growth in the second quarter.
The hit from trade on gross domestic product was, however, likely to be offset by a rise in inventory investment, with the report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday also showing retail inventories increasing strongly last month.
A raft of upbeat data this month, including nonfarm payrolls, retail sales, durable goods orders and housing starts, suggests that the economy remained on a steady growth path in the second quarter, defying fears of a recession.
The goods trade deficit decreased 6.1 percent to $ 91.1 billion last month, leaving the bulk of April's surge intact.
Imports dropped 2.7 percent to $ 254.0 billion. While the decline in imports helped shrink the deficit, it suggested that domestic demand was softening. REUTERS
AVIATION
Joby Says F.A.A. Backs Testing of Electric Air Taxi
Joby Aviation said Wednesday that the Federal Aviation Administration had given the nod for flight testing of its electric air taxi, taking it a step closer to commercial operations.
Joby's shares soared more than 40 percent on Wednesday. Toyota is the company's largest external shareholder, having invested around $ 400 million.
Joby, which is based in California, plans to begin commercial passenger operations in 2025. Unlike other electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVOTL) aircraft manufacturers, which plan to sell aircraft to customers like airlines and logistics companies, Joby has a business model that is similar to a rideshare app.
Once certified, the eVTOL maker will compete in a crowded market with dozens of other developers such as Archer Aviation and Vertical Aerospace.
Joby said the F.A.A. had granted a Special Airworthiness Certificate, which allows flight testing of its first production prototype without passengers. REUTERS

USA Today Brings Back List of Best-Selling Books
USA Today's weekly list of best-selling books, a publishing fixture that had been on hiatus since December, returned Wednesday.
Gannett had not run the list since Mary Cadden, the longtime compiler, was among hundreds laid off late last year. The company says the logging of sales figures has been automated.
The publishing industry has long valued the USA Today rankings as a comprehensive, data-focused way of measuring the consumer market. The list, which began in 1993 and includes the top 150 books, is "based exclusively on sales analysis from U.S. booksellers including bookstore chains, independent bookstores, mass merchandisers and online retailers." Unlike The New York Times, USA Today does not have separate categories for hardcovers, paperbacks, audiobooks and e-books. The top seller Wednesday was Elin Hilderbrand's latest beach read, "The Five-Star Weekend." ASSOCIATED PRESS

James Crown, 70, Leader In the Corporate World And a Key Obama Donor: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He was a director of General Dynamics and served on the board of JPMorgan Chase. He was also a crucial early supporter of Barack Obama.
James Crown, a scion of a wealthy Chicago family who held important positions in businesses as diverse as General Dynamics, Sara Lee and JPMorgan Chase, and who became a crucial early supporter of an up-and-coming politician named Barack Obama, died in Woody Creek, Colo., on Sunday, his 70th birthday.
Mr. Crown's family said in a statement that he died in a single-car accident at the Aspen Motorsports Park racetrack. The statement provided no further details about how he died.
Mr. Crown was the chief executive of Henry Crown & Company, the family's privately owned investment firm. The company is named for his grandfather, the son of a Lithuanian sweatshop worker, who built a family concern that sold sand, gravel, lime and coal into a Chicago business empire worth billions.
James Crown was also the lead director and a major shareholder of the defense and aerospace company General Dynamics; a former chairman of Sara Lee who helped the company split into beverage and food divisions; and a board member of JPMorgan.
An avid philanthropist, Mr. Crown met Mr. Obama in 2003, when he was preparing to run for the U.S. Senate in Illinois, and became an enthusiastic supporter.
Mr. Obama had been trounced in a 2000 congressional race against the Democratic incumbent. His advisers said he needed a greater connection to Chicago's Jewish voters. They also said he needed money, and Mr. Crown provided both.
"I was just taken with his sensibility, his intelligence, his values and how he conducted himself during that campaign," Mr. Crown told The New York Times in 2007.
Mr. Crown and his family donated a total of $ 112,500 to Mr. Obama during the Democratic primary, and Chicago's Jewish leaders raised hundreds of thousands more during the campaign. Mr. Obama won the primary, then defeated Alan Keyes for the Senate seat and began the national political career that would take him to the White House.
A few years later, Mr. Crown became Mr. Obama's chief presidential fund-raiser in Illinois. When Mr. Obama ran for president in 2008, he released a list of earmarks he had secured as a senator, including $ 750,000 to help renovate a space center named after Henry Crown at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.
In 2014, Mr. Obama appointed Mr. Crown to the president's Intelligence Advisory Board, an independent group that advises the president on the effectiveness and goals of U.S. intelligence agencies.
"When Barack was still an unlikely candidate running for the U.S. Senate, Jim became one of his fiercest advocates and most perceptive advisers," Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, said in a statement on Monday. "He believed in our family, and worked hard to convince others across Chicago that they could, too."
Another beneficiary of Mr. Crown's largess was the University of Chicago, where he served as chairman of the board of trustees from 2003 until 2009. The university named its social services school the Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy and Practice after Mr. Crown and his wife, Paula, donated $ 75 million in 2021.
After Mr. Obama left the White House, Mr. Crown continued to mingle with world leaders, including President Biden, whom he saw last week at a state dinner for Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.
"Jim lived a great Chicago story -- one that tied our nation's industrious past to an ever-hopeful future," Mr. Biden said in a statement. "He grew up the great-grandson of a sweatshop worker whose son turned a construction-supply company into an empire. Throughout his own career as a business and civic leader, Jim continued to drive that legacy forward."
Mr. Crown was a director of Bank One, a consumer banking giant in the Midwest and South, from 1991 until 2004, when JPMorgan acquired it in a deal valued at about $ 58 billion. He stayed on as a board member after the merger.
Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chairman and chief executive, wrote in a statement that Mr. Crown "has been a trusted adviser for me for nearly 20 years, playing a key role in helping our company navigate numerous business and economic challenges."
Mr. Crown and two other boardmembers, David Cote and Ellen Futter, drew criticism in 2013 after JPMorgan lost more than $ 6 billion in a bet on credit derivatives. The loss drew scrutiny from federal regulators, demands for more robust risk management and intense criticism of Mr. Dimon.
James Schine Crown was born in Chicago on June 25, 1953, to Lester and Renée (Schine) Crown. His mother also comes from a wealthy family -- her father, J. Myer Schine, made a fortune in real estate and hotels -- and she serves as a director of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and created an honors program at Syracuse University.
Lester Crown was for many years the leading shareholder of General Dynamics. Under his leadership, the Crown family became a minority owner of the Chicago Bulls and the New York Yankees.
The Crown family fortune began with Henry Crown, James's grandfather, born Henry Krinsky, whose father changed the family name to Crown when Henry was a boy. Henry left school in the eighth grade and, with his brother, eventually started the family construction materials business, which he expanded into railroads, meat packing, hotels and, for a time, a major interest in the Empire State Building.
In 2020, Forbes magazine ranked the Crown family the 34th-richest in the United States, with an estimated worth of $ 10.2 billion.
James Crown graduated in 1971 from New Trier East High School in Winnetka, Ill. (now part of New Trier High School). He earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., in 1976. After completing a law degree at Stanford, he began working for Salomon Brothers, the New York City investment bank. James Crown graduated in 1971 from
In 1983, he became a vice president at Salomon, where he met Paula Hannaway, an investment banker. They married in 1985 and moved to Chicago, where Mr. Crown joined his family's investment firm.
In addition to his wife and his parents, Mr. Crown is survived by two brothers, Steve and Daniel; four sisters, Patricia (known as PC), Susan, Sara and Janet Crown; three daughters, Torie, Hayley and Summer Crown; a son, W. Andrew Crown; and two grandsons.
Mr. Crown, who kept a home in Aspen, was also an avid skier and a managing partner of the Aspen Skiing Company, which operates a resort.
The family statement did not say what Mr. Crown was doing at Aspen Motorsports Park when the accident occurred. The park's website says that members gather twice a week to race, typically a qualifying session followed by two races with "fast-paced, wheel-to-wheel action" in "Spec Racer Toyotas."
The racetrack did not respond to phone calls or an email.
Mr. Crown recently began an effort to tackle gun violence in Chicago by encouraging the city's business leaders to create thousands of jobs in underserved areas of the city, providing millions of dollars for civilian violence intervention programs and shoring up law enforcement and low-income communities.
He said that the effort would help Chicago's upper crust as well as its lower-income residents.
"You've got altruism," Mr. Crown told The Chicago Sun-Times. "But you've also got the enlightened self-interest of: I want to be safe, I want my workers to come to work, I want the tourists to patronize my business, whatever that may be."

When Saudis Invited Visitors, They Didn't Expect Christians: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a fluid new age for the conservative Islamic kingdom, evangelicals have become some of its most enthusiastic visitors.
The caravan of five Toyota Land Cruisers raced across Saudi Arabia's rocky desert, weaving onto a highway so new it was not on the map. At the cleft of sea that splits the kingdom from Egypt, they stopped on a barren beach. Fifteen tourists spilled out and gathered around Joel Richardson, a Kansas preacher.
As the sun dipped below the mountains of the Sinai Peninsula -- hazy across the water in Egypt -- Mr. Richardson asked the group to imagine standing on the other side at the moment of the biblical Exodus, fleeing from Pharaoh's army with Moses, when the sea ripped in half.
He opened a Bible, donned his glasses and began to recite. "Who among the gods is like you, oh Lord?" he said. "Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders?"
Two Florida retirees, a Colorado pharmacist, an Idaho bookkeeper and an Israeli archaeologist listened intently.
These were not the visitors Saudi officials expected when they opened the country's borders to leisure tourists in 2019, seeking to diversify the oil-dependent economy and present a new face to the world. First would come the adventurers, they thought -- seasoned travelers searching for an unusual destination -- and then the luxury market, with yacht owners flocking to resorts that the government is building on the Red Sea coast. No one in the conservative Islamic kingdom had planned for the Christians.
Yet Christians of many stripes -- including Baptists, Mennonites and others who call themselves "children of God" -- were among the first people to use the new Saudi tourist visas. Since then, they have grown steadily in numbers, drawn by word of mouth and viral YouTube videos arguing that Saudi Arabia, not Egypt, is the site of Mount Sinai, the peak where Jewish and Christian Scriptures describe God revealing the Ten Commandments.
Mainstream biblical scholars vigorously dispute this. But that does little to dampen the pilgrims' enthusiasm as they embark on what is, for many of them, the trip of a lifetime, hunting for evidence that they think could prove the truth of the Exodus.
"It makes something tangible that you have believed in your whole life," said Kris Gibson, 53, the Idaho bookkeeper on Mr. Richardson's trip, who had never traveled beyond the United States and Mexico before she boarded a plane in February to Saudi Arabia.
For decades, nearly all of the tourists who entered Saudi Arabia were pilgrims going to Mecca, the birthplace of Islam. Openly practicing other religions was effectively forbidden. Synthetic Christmas trees were smuggled in and sold as contraband. People accused of "witchcraft" were executed.
The country's religious dogmatism began to ease early in the 2000s, when tens of thousands of Saudis studied in the United States. Then, in 2015, a new king elevated his 29-year-old son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, into the line of succession.
Prince Mohammed declared that he would turn the kingdom into a global business hub. He unleashed a cascade of social changes, stripping religious police of their powers, loosening dress codes and lifting a ban on women's driving.
He also oversaw an increase in political repression, silencing almost every Saudi voice that might challenge him. In 2018, Saudi agents in Istanbul murdered and dismembered the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a critical exile. An American intelligence assessment determined that the prince probably ordered the killing, a charge he denied.
Since then, Prince Mohammed has defied attempts to isolate him, deploying Saudi Arabia's oil wealth in new ways to cement the country's influence, including this month's surprise deal between a Saudi-backed golf league and the PGA Tour.
As Saudi Arabia traverses this fluid new age, once-unthinkable events have become commonplace, giving daily life the texture of a surreal dream.
Few Saudis would dare to speak of full religious freedom; atheists -- and even Muslims who question the tenets of Islam -- can face imprisonment. But religious taboos are shifting rapidly. Buddhist monks attended an interfaith gathering in the kingdom last year, and Jewish visitors recently planted date palm trees in Medina, Islam's second holiest city. An American-Israeli man turned up in the capital, Riyadh, with a website proclaiming himself "chief rabbi of Saudi Arabia."
The kingdom is changing so fast that people are often unsure what has official approval and what is an accident. Government entities did not respond to requests for comment about Christian tours. Some Saudis privately expressed bemusement, though, and expanding tourism is a priority as the country diversifies its economy.
There is also a more subtle incentive. Saudis have long been portrayed in North America and Europe through tropes that brand them as backward and barbaric. They view tourism as a way to redefine the narrative and showcase their culture: its hospitality, its generosity, its spiced coffee and deep-fried sweets.
"When you think of Saudi Arabia from the States, you certainly don't think of this," said Ms. Gibson, strolling through a canyon filled with palm trees.
'How Beautiful'
When Ms. Gibson told a friend she was going to Saudi Arabia, he called her crazy. She worried about offending Saudis -- wearing the wrong thing, eating with the wrong hand -- but once she arrived, no one seemed to care.
"I'm just absolutely shocked at how beautiful it is," she said. "Because, you know, in my head I'm thinking, nothing but sand."
Israel and Egypt have local Christian populations and long ago welcomed Christian travelers, drawing millions of people a year, many of them American evangelicals. Saudi Arabia is a nascent market. But several tour companies now offer packages geared toward Christians.
Like most similar journeys, Mr. Richardson's tour -- costing $ 5,199 per person -- covered an area that Prince Mohammed chose for a science fiction-inspired mega-project, Neom, where he plans to build a linear metropolis composed entirely of two parallel skyscrapers.
Neom's planners promise to preserve archaeological sites. Still, some Christian tourists worry.
"I wanted to see it in its pristine nature," said Michael Marks, 52, the pharmacist from Colorado, who accelerated his plan to visit because of the project.
Like many Christian tourists, Mr. Marks became interested in the kingdom through the story of Ron Wyatt, an American nurse who popularized the idea that Saudi Arabia was the location of Mount Sinai.
Biblical archaeologists typically place Mount Sinai in Egypt, although there are other theories. A minority points to writings by the Roman historian Flavius Josephus suggesting that Jebel al-Lawz, a mountain in northwestern Saudi Arabia, is the site. There is also local lore that Moses spent time in the area. "No historical or archaeological evidence support these stories," Saudi archaeologists wrote in a 2002 paper.
In the 1980s, Mr. Wyatt smuggled himself into Saudi Arabia and was arrested for entering illegally. He made a series of dubious claims, including that he had discovered the remains of ancient Egyptian chariots under the Red Sea.
Nevertheless, his ideas -- initially on the fringe of evangelical beliefs -- spread. Several years ago, Ryan Mauro, a self-described security analyst and Fox News commentator, narrated a popular YouTube video, "Finding the Mountain of Moses," in which he said: "The Saudis have been hiding the evidence of the Exodus."
Such conspiratorial assertions are often coupled with Islamophobia, but Saudi officials appear to see little conflict in courting conservative American Christians. For one, they are relatively inured to prejudice against Muslims; declarations by Donald J. Trump, like "I think Islam hates us," did not dent his warm ties with Prince Mohammed when he was president.
But also, links to these groups offer a new source of soft power, coveted as an alternative way of connecting to Americans even when formal U.S.-Saudi ties are rocky. In 2018, weeks after Mr. Khashoggi's murder, the prince hosted a delegation of American evangelical leaders in Riyadh.
Evidence in the Desert
Mr. Richardson led his first tour to the kingdom in 2019, when the tourist visas were first available. A bearded man with a dry sense of humor, he was raised nominally Catholic in Massachusetts. As a teenager, he was a "very successful hedonist," he joked.
But in the early 1990s, he came across a tent revival meeting in Tennessee and became an evangelical. "The Holy Spirit just spoke to me and said, 'Your entire life is just a complete lie,"' he said.
He became fascinated by end-times prophesies, and in two books published more than a decade ago, argued that the Antichrist will be Muslim, describing Islam as a "totalitarian ideology" with "satanic origins."
Asked how he reconciles his writing with what he calls a love of the Middle East, he said his perspective has changed, describing himself as a "conservative libertarian" who now has more of a live-and-let-live attitude.
On one of their last days in the kingdom, he took the tourists to a Bedouin camp, where their hosts milked a camel, pouring the frothy liquid from a silver bowl into cups for them to drink. Inside a tent lined with burgundy carpets, they dipped dates into fresh goat butter and feasted on meat and rice piled on platters the size of chandeliers. "This is such a privilege, that we get to be at the forefront of all this," he said, praising the cultural exchange.
That pleasure alone is not what brings him to the kingdom; nor is profit from the tours, which are costly in a country where tourism is still new. Like many of the tourists, he is driven by an urge to uncover proof of the Bible's stories, to walk where he believes they happened. The scenes of the Exodus fill him with awe. Finding signs that it occurred "would be the single greatest sacred biblical step forward in the past couple of thousand years," he said.
"In my opinion," he said, "all the evidence is sitting right out there in the desert."
As they planned their journey, Luis Torres, 54, and his wife, Elinette Ramirez, 55, wanted to mark the occasion. They printed shirts with an image of a mountain crowned in flames with the GPS coordinates of Jebel al-Lawz.
To get there, the group drove for hours and hiked through a golden-brown canyon. "I want to give everyone time to reflect and pray," Mr. Richardson said.
As a child, Ms. Ramirez had struggled to connect to the Bible's stories. Now, she and her husband had traveled all the way from Puerto Rico to see the peak they believed was the mountain of God.
The sun beamed, sending rays floating into the valley, as they lifted their palms to the sky. "Hallelujah! Christ is coming!" they sang. "The trumpet will sound soon and the heavens will open up."
When the time came to leave, Ms. Gibson lingered. She swayed as she gazed at the valley, wrapped in thoughts of the divine.
"All the majesty," she said, her cheeks wet with tears. "I just got overwhelmed."

HAQL, Saudi Arabia — The caravan of five Toyota Land Cruisers raced across Saudi Arabia’s rocky desert, weaving onto a highway so new it was not on the map. At the cleft of sea that splits the kingdom from Egypt, they stopped on a barren beach. Fifteen tourists spilled out and gathered around Joel Richardson, a Kansas preacher.
As the sun dipped below the mountains of the Sinai Peninsula — hazy across the water in Egypt — Richardson asked the group to imagine standing on the other side at the moment of the biblical Exodus, fleeing from Pharaoh’s army with Moses, when the sea ripped in half.
He opened a Bible, donned his glasses and began to recite. “Who among the gods is like you, oh Lord?” he said. “Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders?”
Two Florida retirees, a Colorado pharmacist, an Idaho bookkeeper and an Israeli archaeologist listened intently.
These were not the visitors Saudi officials expected when they opened the country’s borders to leisure tourists in 2019, seeking to diversify the oil-dependent economy and present a new face to the world. First would come the adventurers, they thought — seasoned travelers searching for an unusual destination — and then the luxury market, with yacht owners flocking to resorts that the government is building on the Red Sea coast. No one in the conservative Islamic kingdom had planned for the Christians.
Yet Christians of many stripes — including Baptists, Mennonites and others who call themselves “children of God” — were among the first people to use the new Saudi tourist visas. Since then, they have grown steadily in numbers, drawn by word of mouth and viral YouTube videos arguing that Saudi Arabia, not Egypt, is the site of Mount Sinai, the peak where Jewish and Christian Scriptures describe God revealing the Ten Commandments.
Mainstream biblical scholars vigorously dispute this. But that does little to dampen the pilgrims’ enthusiasm as they embark on what is, for many of them, the trip of a lifetime, hunting for evidence that they think could prove the truth of the Exodus.
“It makes something tangible that you have believed in your whole life,” said Kris Gibson, 53, the Idaho bookkeeper on Richardson’s trip, who had never traveled beyond the United States and Mexico before she boarded a plane in February to Saudi Arabia.
For decades, nearly all the tourists who entered Saudi Arabia were pilgrims going to Mecca, the birthplace of Islam. Openly practicing other religions was effectively forbidden. Synthetic Christmas trees were smuggled in and sold as contraband. People accused of “witchcraft” were executed.
The country’s religious dogmatism began to ease early in the 2000s, when tens of thousands of Saudis studied in the United States. Then, in 2015, a new king elevated his 29-year-old son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, into the line of succession.
Prince Mohammed declared that he would turn the kingdom into a global business hub. He unleashed a cascade of social changes, stripping religious police of their powers, loosening dress codes and lifting a ban on women’s driving.
He also oversaw an increase in political repression, silencing almost every Saudi voice that might challenge him. In 2018, Saudi agents in Istanbul murdered and dismembered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a critical exile. A U.S. intelligence assessment determined that the prince probably ordered the killing, a charge he denied.
Since then, Prince Mohammed has defied attempts to isolate him, deploying Saudi Arabia’s oil wealth in new ways to cement the country’s influence, including this month’s surprise deal between a Saudi-backed golf league and the PGA Tour.
As Saudi Arabia traverses this fluid new age, once-unthinkable events have become commonplace, giving daily life the texture of a surreal dream.
Few Saudis would dare to speak of full religious freedom; atheists — and even Muslims who question the tenets of Islam — can face imprisonment. But religious taboos are shifting rapidly. Buddhist monks attended an interfaith gathering in the kingdom last year, and Jewish visitors recently planted date palm trees in Medina, Islam’s second holiest city. An American-Israeli man turned up in the capital, Riyadh, with a website proclaiming himself “chief rabbi of Saudi Arabia.”
The kingdom is changing so fast that people are often unsure what has official approval and what is an accident. Government entities did not respond to requests for comment about Christian tours. Some Saudis privately expressed bemusement, though, and expanding tourism is a priority as the country diversifies its economy.
There is also a more subtle incentive. Saudis have long been portrayed in North America and Europe through tropes that brand them as backward and barbaric. They view tourism as a way to redefine the narrative and showcase their culture: its hospitality, its generosity, its spiced coffee and deep-fried sweets.
“When you think of Saudi Arabia from the States, you certainly don’t think of this,” said Gibson, strolling through a canyon filled with palm trees.
‘How Beautiful’
When Gibson told a friend she was going to Saudi Arabia, he called her crazy. She worried about offending Saudis — wearing the wrong thing, eating with the wrong hand — but once she arrived, no one seemed to care.
“I’m just absolutely shocked at how beautiful it is,” she said. “Because, you know, in my head I’m thinking, nothing but sand.”
Israel and Egypt have local Christian populations and long ago welcomed Christian travelers, drawing millions of people a year, many of them American evangelicals. Saudi Arabia is a nascent market. But several tour companies now offer packages geared toward Christians.
Like most similar journeys, Richardson’s tour — costing $5,199 per person — covered an area that Prince Mohammed chose for a science fiction-inspired mega-project, Neom, where he plans to build a linear metropolis composed entirely of two parallel skyscrapers.
Neom’s planners promise to preserve archaeological sites. Still, some Christian tourists worry.

Remembering a Revolution That So Many Forget: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: On a rainy night last month, down an alleyway in the Jackson Heights section of Queens, in a restaurant basement, sat about two dozen retirees. There was a onetime federal tax agent, a retired car salesman, a former pharmacy cashier and several taxi drivers who had shut off their meters for good.
One of these men, Golam Khan, a 72-year-old ex-cabby, was in charge. He put his arm around other gray-haired men and whispered instructions. He cleared the front row of seats for a few distinguished guests.
After some introductory speeches, Mr. Khan stood before the crowd at a lectern on a raised stage. He cast his mind to their faraway homeland, Bangladesh, and the time more than 50 years ago when they participated in the victorious but bloody war that led to the nation's independence.
"We are fortunate people who fought in the War of Liberation," he said. "In a nation's life, freedom fighters come but once."
The 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War might seem like an obscure bit of history, but it looms as an immense trauma for many New Yorkers -- people like the men in that basement. The war provided their most honored accomplishments and their most terrifying memories.
Estimates of how many Bengalis were killed in 1971 range from the hundreds of thousands to the millions. A leading American scholar of the conflict, the Princeton international affairs professor Gary Bass, calls it "a forgotten genocide."
Finding men and women who lived through the war is not difficult in New York. From 2000 to 2015, Bangladeshis were the city's fastest-growing immigrant group. Revolutionaries of the 1970s today work humble jobs on the streets and sidewalks where New Yorkers spend their days.
Fakhrul Alam, a 69-year-old owner of newsstands in Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx, says that in 1971 he guarded what he calls a "famous tree" that from time immemorial both Hindus and Muslims had believed to possess magic healing powers -- until he woke up one morning to find the whole tree somehow stolen, uprooted: a casualty of the war.
Jewel Mohammad Jamal, 69, a Midtown traffic policeman, says that during his time as a young soldier, he once saw hundreds of dead bodies floating in the Salda River, near Bangladesh's eastern border with India. If he describes this moment in conversation, he said, he fears that nightmares will haunt his sleep.
That might seem like a reason to repress memories. Yet in interviews, dozens of Bangladeshi veterans grew expansive when given the chance to recount heroic and tragic episodes from the distant world of their youth.
"Nobody asked me," said Shawkat Akbar, a 68-year-old retired seller of Fords and Toyotas, "but if somebody did ask me, I would explain very well our liberation war."
Mr. Akbar is part of the organization that held last month's event and that Mr. Khan founded and runs, Bangladesh Liberation War Veterans 1971 U.S.A. Inc. The group of about 60 veterans provides a forum for gossip, ennobles its working-class members with titles (Mr. Khan has appointed eight of them vice presidents) and stages events where poems are recited, war stories are recounted, old slogans are raised, manly tears are shed and an exalted status lost with immigration to the United States is recovered, briefly.
The occasion last month was honoring Ruhul Amin, a veteran who died in April and who, like Mr. Khan, was a retired taxi driver in his 70s.
"After five years, after 10 years, freedom fighters will not have ability to arrange these events," Mr. Khan said in his speech. His voice broke, and his eyes grew red and watery. "We will not be around anymore."
Mr. Khan discussed the meaning of this prospect in an interview a few days later.
"When the people came from Bangladesh, they have become crazy to make money," he said. "They have forgot their culture, they have forgot their nationality." But now, he continued, they have settled down. "We're all retired people."
This is the moment when a first generation of immigrants finally has time to reminisce.
Tazin Khan, 30, a cybersecurity specialist and one of Mr. Khan's daughters, asked to join one of our interviews. "I hope you don't mind if I ask questions," she said. "I am trying to learn this history, too."
Before 1971, Bangladesh was a region of Pakistan, which encompassed two halves separated by about 1,000 miles, with India in between. West Pakistan, populated largely by Punjabis who spoke Urdu, was militarily, politically and economically dominant, while East Pakistan consisted of Bengalis who felt marginalized.
East Pakistan was a poor, agrarian society with a popular, pipe-smoking, bespectacled and frequently imprisoned leader in Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who fought for greater autonomy for Bengalis.
Even in casual conversation, Mr. Khan refers to him by his full name, preceded by his sobriquet, "Father of the Nation, Friend of Bengal."
Mr. Khan and Mr. Rahman came from landowning families in the same rural district. As a teenager, Mr. Khan recalls, he found his way to a meeting at his idol's home. He stood up and announced that he would like to recite a poem by the Bengali writer Kazi Nazrul Islam.
Mr. Khan still remembers the poem.
"The mosque, church, and Buddhist temple and Hindu temple -- all crush it, break down it," he declaimed in his living room. "Start a slogan by the name of Human Being -- A Victory for the Human Being."
Mr. Rahman won Pakistan's 1970 general election, but was denied the prime ministership by the West's military authorities, who feared that he would bring about the East's secession. Bengali protest became the pretext for Mr. Rahman's arrest and a military crackdown on March 25, 1971.
Mr. Khan requested his parents' blessing to join a Bengali guerrilla uprising.
"Fight for your country," Mr. Khan recalled his father telling him. "I have another two sons."
The decision represented a grave risk.
The Pakistani army used its firepower to brutal ends, Professor Bass said in a phone interview: "You're seeing massive numbers of civilians being killed in a systematic campaign. That easily qualifies as crimes against humanity."
Mr. Khan describes his experience of the war as an Odyssean saga.
He traversed his nation by foot, he says, to be armed and trained in India before returning to his homeland. His platoon scattered after it was ambushed. He shot a Pakistani captain at close range. Twice he watched a fellow soldier die right next to him. Twice he killed someone he did not intend to in the middle of a firefight. He was tricked by a group of Maoist insurgents, who gave his troop free food and then tried to steal their guns. He allied with another Bengali military unit, defected from it and allied with yet a third group. He narrowly escaped a deadly mortar blast.
With the war still raging, he returned home. It was nighttime. He stood outside. "Ma?" Mr. Khan called.
Soon he was inside, his family surrounding him. His father told him they had received a letter stating that he had died during the ambush. Mr. Khan's family had already held his funeral.
The war ended in December 1971 with Pakistan's defeat. Mr. Rahman became the leader of independent Bangladesh, but he suspended democracy in 1974 and was assassinated in 1975. Bangladeshi politics lost the secular progressivism of Mr. Khan's poem and split into bitter divisions.
Mr. Khan became a rebel again, only to find himself imprisoned and tortured. After being released, he earned a master's degree in Bengali literature and started a prosperous furniture business. Years passed, and Mr. Khan became a well-connected businessman with the reputation of a war hero.
In the early 1990s, the political winds in Bangladesh changed and he faced the threat of another detention. He gave up everything and moved to the United States in 1993. Now he was a poor immigrant from an obscure land.
He asked himself, Am I not meant to do something better than drive a taxi?
He did the job in two stints, in the 1990s and again in the 2010s, in addition to working as a cashier at McDonald's and managing a grocery store.
His three children attended college in the United States and now have corporate or creative professions in New York City. In 2017, thanks to their financial support, Mr. Khan was able to retire. He lives with Rizia Khan, his wife since 1982, in New Hyde Park on Long Island.
Of all the occasions when Mr. Khan has spoken in America about his past, one stands out.
In September 2021, he found himself at an improbable scene: a packed hip-hop show at Manhattan's Bowery Ballroom. At one point, the concert organizers summoned him backstage.
Shortly thereafter, the headliner, a Bangladeshi American rapper named Anik Khan, paused between songs. He announced a special guest: someone who had grown up in a village, recited poetry in front of thousands, started a successful business, enjoyed the services of a personal driver -- and then left it all behind to become a driver for other people while living in a one-bedroom apartment with six people in Queens.
"If it's OK," Anik said, "I'd love to bring out my father to do one of his poems."
To the sound of a blaring klaxon and shrieks from the crowd, Mr. Khan emerged. Anik was sporting cornrows and an unbuttoned short-sleeve shirt; his father wore pointed slippers, a white kurta and a green shawl with golden trim. Turning toward the hip-hop fans, Golam folded his hands in the traditional South Asian sign of respect.
He did not, however, recite his poem.
"I was a freedom fighter in the War of Liberation," he said.
Many in the crowd could not have known what war, exactly, he was referring to, but they cheered in response.
Mr. Khan continued: "In 1971 ..."
Anik reappeared. He whispered something into his father's ear and made a straight-ahead gesture with his arm before backing away.
Mr. Khan continued his explanation.
"This poetry was very much encouragement the War of Liberation," he went on. "I was very young that time."
Anik returned. He leaned over his father's shoulder, the microphone picking up his words. "I have to do a show, Baba," Anik pleaded. "Can you do your poem? Right now. No more talking."
For two minutes, gesticulating to the crowd and to his heart, Mr. Khan recited Bengali verse.
Finally, he finished. The D.J. shouted, "Make some noise for Golam!"
He might not have made himself understood, but in that moment, Mr. Khan found glory in America.

Full text: Three years ago, Steven Kraft disappeared. This week, Jamie and Nicholas Orsini were arrested and accused of carrying out an elaborate plot to kill him and dispose of his body.
Just before 4 p.m. on April 28, 2020, Steven Kraft did as he often did on Tuesday afternoons. He left his job at a deli in Marlboro, N.Y., and headed across the Hudson River to Beacon, where he picked up his two middle-school-aged children from his ex-wife's house. He caught up with them over a fast-food dinner before returning them to their mother's home around 7 p.m.
That was the last time anyone saw Mr. Kraft alive.
His disappearance remained a mystery for more than three years. But on Thursday, Mr. Kraft's ex-wife, Jamie Orsini, and her husband, Nicholas Orsini, were arrested and each charged with one count of carjacking resulting in death and one count of conspiracy.
The Orsinis are accused of concocting and executing an elaborate scheme to murder Mr. Kraft, 34, and dismember and burn his body, according to a criminal complaint filed in Federal District Court in White Plains, N.Y.
The plan involved the use of multiple burner phones, stealing and dumping Mr. Kraft's car and the Orsinis repeatedly traveling long distances in an attempt to throw the authorities off their scent, the complaint says. Mr. Kraft's body has not been recovered, according to investigators.
If convicted, the couple could face life in prison or the death penalty.
"The Orsinis denied Kraft's family -- including Kraft's children with Jamie -- the dignity of having a proper burial," Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement.
Dean Kraft, Mr. Kraft's father, said in an interview on Friday that his family had been waiting for this moment for three years, but that they were still searching for answers.
"Steven would never have been the type of person to leave his daughters, so we have always assumed the worst, that something terrible happened to him," the elder Mr. Kraft, who lives in Illinois, said. He added that after the Orsinis' arrests, "some people have said, 'Oh, great, now you can have closure.' That may be true for some people, but I still have a son that is out there missing somewhere. Where is he? Where is his body at? What did they do with him?"
In the days leading up to Mr. Kraft's death, the Orsinis began preparing to kill him and cover their tracks, according to the complaint.
They made several trips to a Walmart and a Home Depot in Fishkill, N.Y., where they bought burner phones, a 10 foot by 100 foot tarp, duct tape and a Tyvek suit and boots. They paid for it all with cash, the complaint says.
The couple also made a "dry run" of the circuitous route they intended to take to dispose of Mr. Kraft's car: driving around Beacon, over a bridge across the Hudson River, and into Newburgh, investigators said.
By the time Mr. Kraft got to the Orsinis' house in Beacon on April 28, the complaint says, the Orsinis had rehearsed and were prepared to follow through on their plan.
They activated the burner phones and followed Mr. Kraft throughout the evening while he spent time with the children. At some point after he brought them to the Orsinis' home, the authorities believe, the couple killed him.
Just before 9 p.m., Mr. Orsini, 35, drove Mr. Kraft's car along the same route he had rehearsed just days before and left it on a street corner near the Newburgh waterfront. He then walked about a mile to a gas station, where he used a $ 100 bill to buy an energy drink and called a taxi back to Beacon from a burner phone.
Over the next several days, the complaint says, the Orsinis bought more burner phones, conducted suspicious Google searches -- including "is galvanized steel fire-proof" -- and bought materials that could be used to chop up and burn a body, including 31-gallon galvanized steel trash cans, an angle grinder, an ax and 16 bundles of firewood.
On several occasions, according to the complaint, the couple left their personal phones at home and drove more than 120 miles each way to visit Mr. Orsini's family in Amsterdam, N.Y., north of Albany. On May 2, Mr. Orsini texted his mother to ask if she had told anyone he was visiting her upstate.
Ms. Orsini, 36, also texted her ex-husband's phone in the days after his disappearance to ask about their children's report cards -- a strange move, the complaint says, because "they did not typically text about their children's academics."
She also called the police to ask about Mr. Kraft's whereabouts.
On May 4, the police discovered Mr. Kraft's Toyota Camry parked, with tickets, in the same area where authorities believe the Orsinis left it, according to the complaint. The car was impounded that day, the complaint says. On May 7, the authorities believe, the couple returned to Newburgh to check on the vehicle.
During the investigation, the New York State Police, local police departments and the F.B.I. reviewed surveillance footage, store receipts, cellphone GPS data, call and text records, Google search data, evidence found in the Orsinis' home and more.
"We worked tirelessly for three years to find some kind of closure and justice for Steven Kraft and his family," Joseph Merla, a New York State Police investigator, said.
When Mr. Kraft and Ms. Orsini got divorced, their relationship was tense and they communicated only through the courts, Mr. Kraft's father said. In more recent years, he said, the two appeared to be getting along better. Ms. Orsini kept in touch with the elder Mr. Kraft so he could maintain contact with his grandchildren.
"She said I could write them, and I did," Mr. Kraft said. "Then after Steven went missing -- it was about three months -- all communication just stopped."
Mr. Merla said the couple "definitely had their fair share of family court issues."
A 2016 appeals court decision related to custody of their two children details a yearslong effort by Ms. Orsini to obtain full custody and a similar battle by Mr. Kraft to be awarded unsupervised visitation. The judge in the case denied both requests.
At the time of Mr. Kraft's disappearance, he had custody of his children on weekends and Tuesdays from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., according to the complaint.
The Orsinis moved from Beacon to Amsterdam in the months after Mr. Kraft's disappearance, Mr. Merla said. Mr. Orsini most recently worked at a bar, and Ms. Orsini was a stay-at-home mother to her four children, including two with Mr. Orsini.
Child protective services was notified of the Orsinis' arrest and has opened an investigation into the family, Mr. Merla said.
Mr. Kraft's father said he did not know where his grandchildren are now, but he said "they still have a grandpa, and they also have family that love them dearly, even if they haven't met them."

With Economic Upswing, Japan Is Luring Investors: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Japanese stock market is up nearly 30 percent this year, far ahead of the S&P 500, as firms bet that changes in how companies are run might just finally last.
The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, stood in front of the cameras in 2014 and said he was going to shake up the staid ways companies operated in Japan. It was a tall order. Shellshocked by years of economic malaise that followed the bubble of the 1980s, Japanese executives had clung to the status quo for years. Raises for employees and returns for shareholders were scarce. The consequence was an economy that barely grew.
Now, there are signs of a significant shift in how the country's corporations are run, changes that are helping to breathe life into the economy. In recent months, Canon shareholders have demanded a diverse board of directors, Citizen Watch has said it would buy back up to a quarter of its shares, and the owner of Uniqlo has promised its workers raises of up to 40 percent. The Tokyo Stock Exchange has implored companies to be "conscious" of their share prices.
Mix in a surprisingly solid economy this year, a weak currency, ultralow interest rates -- while many of the world's biggest economies are raising them -- and a plug from Warren E. Buffett and you have the world's best performing major stock market.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index has jumped nearly 30 percent this year, far outstripping the gains for the S&P 500, the benchmark in the United States. The Nikkei has not been this high since the early 1990s, when Japan was slumping into what is known as the Lost Decade.
Some observers are quick to warn that investors have been burned in the past by being overly optimistic about a change in boardroom attitudes in Japan. But company profits are improving, and Japan's economy, the world's third largest, is basking in a postpandemic glow: Inflation has finally returned, consumer spending is rising and foreign tourists are back.
"The fundamental economic conditions in Japan, including corporate earnings, are better than in the U.S., Europe and China," said Yuichi Murao, a top executive at Nomura Asset Management in Tokyo. "In terms of G.D.P. growth, Japan is going to outperform."
The increase in Japan's gross domestic product for the first three months of the year was revised sharply up last week, to an annual rate of 2.7 percent from an initial reading of 1.6 percent. The overall picture remains mixed because the bump that came from more spending by companies was geared more to restocking the shelves and warehouses, not demand from customers. Private consumption, a gauge of how much people are spending, weakened slightly.
Still, domestic demand remains strong, Mr. Murao said. Expectations are high that it will rise further, along the lines of the so-called revenge spending that other countries saw after their lockdowns ended. Japan was among the last countries to lift restrictions, and while the number of tourists is still much lower than what it was before 2020, overseas visitors are streaming in.
"They are spending much more money than before," partly because of the weak yen, Mr. Murao said. The yen has fallen to the lowest level since the 1990s against the U.S. dollar.
Japan has also made strides against two perennial problems, with wages and inflation improving in recent months. Consumer prices, excluding fresh food, rose 3.4 percent in April, the highest level in decades. Rising inflation is more welcome in Japan than it is in the United States and Europe because it has been mired at such low levels for so long, and the Japanese central bank has indicated it will stick with monetary easing.
But the inflation has largely been driven by postpandemic supply shortages, said Chong Hoon Park, the head of economic research for Japan and South Korea at Standard Chartered Bank in Seoul. "It's not driven by wage growth," Mr. Park said, adding he expects inflation to drop next year below the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target.
The challenge is to sustain and broaden the increase in incomes that segments of the economy have witnessed recently. A survey by a business group found that large companies agreed to raise salaries an average of 3.9 percent this year, the highest rate in decades.
The government is focused on raising wages and making it easier for workers to switch jobs in pursuit of higher pay. Last week, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida repeated that his economic priorities included "structural wage increases and labor market reform."
Another leader in pushing for a change in corporate thinking is the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In March, the exchange laid out a plan that would force companies trading below their book value to increase their stock prices. Some of the easiest ways to do so is to pay bigger dividends and buy back more stock. While it's unclear when the exchange will start the policy, behemoths like Toyota and Honda, which has said it plans to buy back stock this year, are likely to have to make changes. (Toyota shares are up 27 percent and Honda's 50 percent this year.)
The Nikkei 225 index rose 1.5 percent on Wednesday to 33,502, a new high for the year.
The shift to get companies to pay more attention to profits and stock prices has been evident to Seth Fischer, a hedge fund manager who has publicly agitated for change at Japanese companies for more than a decade, perhaps most memorably by urging Nintendo to get its games on mobile phones.
"We see dramatic changes in senior executives' behavior," Mr. Fischer, the founder of Oasis Capital, said from Hong Kong.
One example Mr. Fischer points to is Canon, the camera and optical equipment company. Shareholders reprimanded its chairman and chief executive, nearly ousting him from the board, for a lack of gender diversity among directors. And the continuous prodding to invest more of the money they hold in reserve has led to Japanese corporations to announce a record $ 70 billion in buybacks in the year that ended in March, according to the Nikkei newspaper. Dividends for the current year are likely to hit another record, topping $ 100 billion. All of these moves combine to put money into the real economy.
Then there is the endorsement from Mr. Buffett, who said recently that he had increased his holdings in the Japanese conglomerates Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo. In April, he told Nikkei that he planned to invest more in Japanese companies. Foreign investors have poured money into Japanese stocks since then, some shying away from China as tensions between Beijing and Washington rise.
Mr. Fischer is among the bullish. And as companies take actions to improve their value, he said, they will help the overall economy of Japan by increasing incomes.
"Investors have finally gotten notice that there is a sea change opportunity in Japan," he said.

Inflation Pressures Ease, Lowering Producer Prices
Wholesale prices in the United States dropped 0.3 percent from April to May, another sign that inflationary pressures are easing in the face of repeated interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
The producer price index -- which measures inflation before it reaches consumers -- rose 1.1 percent last month from May 2022, the Labor Department said Wednesday
On a month-to-month basis, overall producer prices have now dropped three of the last four months. In May, wholesale inflation was pulled down by a 13.8 percent drop in gasoline prices.
Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core wholesale inflation was up 0.2 percent last from April and 2.8 percent from a year earlier, the mildest gain since February 2021.
Unleashed by an unexpectedly strong economic recovery from 2020′s pandemic recession, inflation began to rise in 2021 and last year reached levels not seen since the early 1980s. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Toyota's Shareholders Reject Climate Resolution
Toyota shareholders rejected a resolution urging greater disclosure of its climate lobbying on Wednesday, voting down the first investor proposal to come before the automaker's annual general meeting in almost two decades.
The climate resolution was submitted by a Danish pension fund, AkademikerPension, and two other European asset managers and sought to make Toyota release more details about its lobbying activities related to climate change. It was widely expected to fail after Toyota's board recommended that shareholders vote against it.
Still, the proposal sharpened focus on Toyota's electric vehicle strategy and governance ahead of the meeting, the first under its new chief executive, Koji Sato. Green investors and activists have said Toyota has been too slow to capitalize on the surging popularity of battery electrics.
Some influential U.S. funds, including top public pension CalPERS, had come out in favor of the climate resolution. REUTERS

Upside Foods Approved For Cultivated Chicken
Upside Foods has received regulatory approval from the Department of Agriculture for the label on its cell-cultivated chicken, the company said on Wednesday, making it the second producer in the United States to secure that approval.
Several companies are seeking approval from U.S. regulators for cultivated meat and fish products, hoping to appeal to consumersconcerned about the environmental impact of raising livestock for food.
Upside was the first company to receive a green light for its cultivated chicken from the Food and Drug Administration last year.
Cultivated meat is made from a small sample of livestock cells collected from living animals, which are then fed a nutrient mix and grown inside steel vats.
Upside does not yet have a timeline for when its production facility in Emeryville, Calif., will be inspected by the U.S.D.A., the company said. REUTERS

U.S. Battery Subsidies Put Allies on Edge: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The European Union is trying to assemble the building blocks to produce electric cars, but subsidies are luring companies to the United States.
European leaders complained for years that the United States was not doing enough to fight climate change. Now that the Biden administration has devoted hundreds of billions of dollars to that cause, many Europeans are complaining that the United States is going about it the wrong way.
That new critique is born of a deep fear in Germany, France, Britain and other European countries that Washington's approach will hurt the allies it ought to be working with, luring away much of the new investments in electric car and battery factories not already destined for China, South Korea and other Asian countries.
That concern is the main reason some European leaders, including Germany's second-highest-ranking official, Robert Habeck, have beaten a path to Vasteras, a city about 60 miles from Stockholm that is best known for a Viking burial mound and a Gothic cathedral.
Officials have been traveling there to court one of Europe's few homegrown battery companies, Northvolt. Led by a former Tesla executive, Northvolt is a small player in the global battery industry, but European leaders are offering it hundreds of millions of euros to build factories in Europe. Mr. Habeck visited in February to lobby the company to push ahead on its plan to build a factory near Hamburg, Germany. The company had considered postponing to invest in the United States instead.
"It's definitely attractive to be in America right now," Emma Nehrenheim, Northvolt's chief environmental officer, said in an interview last month in Vasteras. Northvolt declined to comment in detail on the discussions about the Hamburg plant, which the company committed to in May.
The tussle over Northvolt's plans is an example of the intense and, some European officials say, counterproductive competition between the United States and Europe as they try to acquire the building blocks of electric vehicle manufacturing to avoid becoming dependent on China, which dominates the battery supply chain.
Auto experts said that the tax credits and other incentives offered by President Biden's main climate policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, had siphoned some investment from Europe and put pressure on European countries to offer their own incentives.
The United States has provoked a "massive subsidy race," Cecilia Malmstrom, a former European trade commissioner, said during a panel discussion last month at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. She called on leaders to "jointly invest in the green transition and not compete against each other."
Biden officials have argued that U.S. and European policies are complementary. They have noted that the government and private money going into electric cars and batteries would lower prices for car buyers and put more emission-free vehicles on the road.
U.S. officials add that construction of battery factories and plants to process lithium and other materials is booming on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Efforts by governments to promote electric vehicles "will spur a degree of technological innovation and cost cutting that will be beneficial not only to Europe and the United States, but to the global economy and to our global effort to meet the challenge that climate change presents," Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, said in a recent interview.
The Biden administration has also been talking with European officials about allowing cars made from European battery materials and components to qualify for U.S. tax credits. And the administration has interpreted the I.R.A., which Mr. Biden signed in August, to leave room for producers in Europe and elsewhere to benefit.
"You're seeing less of a concern from Europe that those companies may be lured away from Europe to America," said Abigail Wulf, who directs the Center for Critical Minerals Strategy at SAFE, a nonprofit organization.
Still, the law has forced European leaders to put new industrial policies in place.
In March, the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, proposed the Critical Raw Materials Act, legislation to ensure supplies of lithium, nickel and other battery materials. One piece of the legislation calls for the E.U. to process at least 40 percent of the raw materials that the car industry needs within its own borders. The 27-nation alliance has also let countries provide more financial support to suppliers and manufacturers.
The money that the United States and Europe are pouring into electric vehicles will encourage sales, said Julia Poliscanova, a senior director at Transport & Environment, an advocacy group in Brussels. The legislation, which will need the approval of the European Parliament and the leaders of E.U. countries, would also bring some coherence to the fragmented policies of national governments, she said.
But Ms. Poliscanova added that European and U.S. policies risk canceling each other out. "Because everyone is scaling up at the same time, it's a zero-sum game," she said.
Business executives have complained that applying for financial aid in Europe is bureaucratic and slow. The Inflation Reduction Act, with its emphasis on tax credits, is simpler and faster, said Tom Einar Jensen, chief executive of the battery maker Freyr, which is building a factory in Mo i Rana, in northern Norway, and has plans to construct more plants in Finland and near Atlanta.
The I.R.A. has prompted "a dramatic increase in uptick in interest for batteries produced in the U.S.," Mr. Jensen said in an interview.
The future of European auto manufacturing is at stake, particularly for German companies. Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen have already lost market share in China to local automakers like BYD. Chinese automakers, including BYD and SAIC, are also making inroads in Europe. Selling cars under the British brand MG, SAIC has amassed 5 percent of the European electric vehicle market, putting it ahead of Toyota and Ford in that fast-growing segment.
European carmakers are frantically trying to build the supply chains they need to churn out electric vehicles.
In France, President Emmanuel Macron wants to convert a northern region where factory jobs have been in decline into a hub of battery production.
On Tuesday, Automotive Cells Company, a joint venture between Stellantis, Mercedes-Benz and TotalEnergies, inaugurated a factory in Billy-Berclau Douvrin, France, that aims to produce 300,000 electric batteries annually by the end of 2024. A.C.C. also plans to invest a total of 7.3 billion euros, or $ 7.8 billion, in Europe, including opening factories in Germany and in Italy, a deal sealed with 1.3 billion euros in public aid.
In Salzgitter, Germany, some 25 miles from Volkswagen's headquarters, steel beams tower above concrete foundations as excavators and dump trucks hum nearby. In a matter of months, the outlines of a battery factory have risen out of a field.
Volkswagen hopes to have battery-making machines installed before the end of the summer. By 2025, the automaker aims to produce battery cells for up to 500,000 electric vehicles a year -- a timeline that the company said was possible only because the factory was being built on land it owned.
Volkswagen is also building a factory in Ontario, but the company made the decision to do so only after the Canadian government matched U.S. incentives.
In Guben, a small city on Germany's border with Poland, Rock Tech Lithium, a Canadian company, is building a plant to process lithium ore. Mercedes has an agreement with Rock Tech to supply lithium to its battery producers.
These projects won't reach full production for several years. Recently, the Guben site was an open field. The only construction activity was a truck that dumped loads of crushed rock, making an ear-piercing screech.
Europe has some advantages, including a strong demand for electric cars: About 14 percent of new cars sold in the E.U. in the first three months of this year were battery powered, according to Schmidt Automotive Research, twice as many as in the United States.
But if Europe doesn't move quickly to aid the battery industry, "you will really lose momentum on the ground versus the North American market," said Dirk Harbecke, chief executive of Rock Tech.
Chinese battery companies have largely avoided the United States for fear of a political backlash. But Chinese battery firms have announced investments in Europe worth $ 17.5 billion since 2018, according to the Mercator Institute for China Studies and the Rhodium Group.
Political tension between Western governments and China has put German carmakers in a delicate position. They do not want to be overly dependent on Chinese supplies, but they cannot afford to displease the Chinese government.
BMW, Volkswagen and Volvo plan to buy cells from a factory in Arnstadt, Germany, run by CATL, a Chinese company that is currently the world's largest maker of electric vehicle batteries.
To balance their reliance on Chinese suppliers, European executives and leaders are keen to work with Northvolt, whose chief executive, Peter Carlsson, oversaw Tesla's supply chain for more than four years.
Northvolt wants to control all the steps of making batteries, including refining lithium and recycling old cells. That should help Europe achieve supply chain independence and ensure that batteries are produced in the most environmentally responsible way possible, said Ms. Nehrenheim, who is also a member of the Northvolt management board. "We're de-risking Europe," she said.
The company develops manufacturing techniques at its complex in Vasteras. Northvolt's first full-scale factory, at a site in Sweden 125 miles south of the Arctic Circle chosen for its abundant hydropower, is the size of the Pentagon. Northvolt also plans to build a U.S. factory, but has not yet announced a site.
Still, the company is ramping up production and is not among the world's top 10 battery suppliers, according to SNE Research, a consulting firm. And construction on its Hamburg plant is on hold until E.U. officials approve German subsidies.

Electric Vehicle Maker Seeks a Cash Infusion
The electric carmaker Lucid Group said it plans to raise about $ 3 billion through a stock offering, nearly two-thirds of which will come from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The funds come as the automaker, like its peers, struggles with mounting losses and tightening cash reserves amid recession fears and a price war sparked by Tesla.
Lucid's cash and cash equivalents had dropped to $ 900 million at the end of the first quarter, from $ 1.74 billion in the previous quarter. Sherry House, the company's chief financial officer, said the firm had about $ 4.1 billion in liquidity, enough to fund it at least into the second quarter of next year.
The maker of luxury sedans trimmed its 2023 production forecast last month and reported lower-than-expected first-quarter revenue. Despite Lucid's struggles, the Saudi fund has been a loyal investor in the automaker, with its stake currently worth nearly $ 9 billion. REUTERS

Toyota Will Beef Up E.V. Production in U.S.
Toyota will invest another $ 2.1 billion in an electric and hybrid vehicle battery factory that's under construction near Greensboro, N.C.
The plant will supply batteries to Toyota's huge complex in Georgetown, Ky., which will build Toyota's first U.S.-made electric vehicle, a new S.U.V. with three rows of seats.
Toyota plans to employ 2,100 workers at the North Carolina battery factory, which will start production in 2025. The investment will prepare infrastructure for expansion. It brings the total investment in the Randolph County plant to $ 5.9 billion to meet the company's goal of selling 1.8 million electric or hybrid vehicles in the United States by 2030.
The 9 million-square-foot Kentucky complex now employs 9,500 people who make the Camry sedan, RAV4 Hybrid SUV, several engines and other components. The company says jobs will shift to the new electric vehicle when production starts in 2025. ASSOCIATED PRESS

American Plans to Appeal Ruling Against Alliance
American Airlines will appeal a federal court decision requiring it to end an alliance with JetBlue Airways, American's chief executive, Robert Isom, said on Wednesday.
Judge Leo Sorokin of U.S. District Court in Boston ruled on May 19 that the airlines' Northeast Alliance broke antitrust law and ordered the companies to dissolve the arrangement within 30 days.
"We've got a legal system that allows for appeal, and we're going to do that," Mr. Isom said at Bernstein's annual Strategic Decisions Conference.
The Justice Department sued in 2021 to undo the alliance announced the previous year. It called it a "de facto merger" of American and JetBlue operations in Boston and New York that removed incentives to compete and would end up costing consumers an additional $ 700 million a year to fly out of the region's busy airports.

As U.S. Races Ahead, Europe Frets About Battery Factory Subsidies

VASTERAS, Sweden — European leaders complained for years that the United States was not doing enough to fight climate change. Now that the Biden administration has devoted hundreds of billions of dollars to that cause, many Europeans are complaining that the United States is going about it the wrong way.
That new critique is born of a deep fear in Germany, France, Britain and other European countries that Washington’s approach will hurt the allies it ought to be working with, luring away much of the new investments in electric car and battery factories not already destined for China, South Korea and other Asian countries.
That concern is the main reason some European leaders, including Germany’s second highest ranking official, Robert Habeck, have beaten a path to Vasteras, a city about 60 miles from Stockholm that is best known for a Viking burial mound and a Gothic cathedral.
Officials have been traveling there to court one of Europe’s few homegrown battery companies, Northvolt. Led by a former Tesla executive, Northvolt is a small player in the global battery industry, but European leaders are offering it hundreds of millions of euros to build factories in Europe. Habeck visited in February to lobby the company to push ahead on its plan to build a factory near Hamburg, Germany. The company had considered postponing to invest in the United States instead.
“It’s definitely attractive to be in America right now,” Emma Nehrenheim, Northvolt’s chief environmental officer, said in an interview last month in Vasteras. Northvolt declined to comment in detail on the discussions about the Hamburg plant, which the company committed to in May.
The tussle over Northvolt’s plans is an example of the intense and, some European officials say, counterproductive competition between the United States and Europe as they try to acquire the building blocks of electric vehicle manufacturing to avoid becoming dependent on China, which dominates the battery supply chain.
Auto experts said the tax credits and other incentives offered by President Joe Biden’s main climate policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, had siphoned some investment from Europe and put pressure on European countries to offer their own incentives.
The United States has provoked a “massive subsidy race,” Cecilia Malmstrom, a former European trade commissioner, said during a panel discussion last month at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. She called on leaders to “jointly invest in the green transition and not compete against each other.”
Biden officials have argued that U.S. and European policies are complementary. They have noted that the government and private money going into electric cars and batteries would lower prices for car buyers and put more emission-free vehicles on the road.
U.S. officials add that construction of battery factories and plants to process lithium and other materials is booming on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Efforts by governments to promote electric vehicles “will spur a degree of technological innovation and cost cutting that will be beneficial not only to Europe and the United States, but to the global economy and to our global effort to meet the challenge that climate change presents,” Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, said in a recent interview.
The Biden administration has also been talking with European officials about allowing cars made with European battery materials and components to qualify for U.S. tax credits. And the administration has interpreted the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed in August, to leave room for producers in Europe and elsewhere to benefit.
“You’re seeing less of a concern from Europe that those companies may be lured away from Europe to America,” said Abigail Wulf, who directs the Center for Critical Minerals Strategy at SAFE, a nonprofit organization.
Still, the U.S. law has forced European leaders to put new industrial policies in place.
In March, the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, proposed the Critical Raw Materials Act, legislation to ensure supplies of lithium, nickel and other battery materials. One piece of the legislation calls for the EU to process at least 40% of the raw materials that the car industry needs within its own borders. The 27-nation alliance has also let countries provide more financial support to suppliers and manufacturers.
The money that the United States and Europe are pouring into electric vehicles will encourage sales, said Julia Poliscanova, a senior director at Transport & Environment, an advocacy group in Brussels. The legislation, which will need the approval of the European Parliament and the leaders of EU countries, would also bring some coherence to the fragmented policies of national governments, she said.
But Poliscanova added that European and U.S. policies risk canceling each other out. “Because everyone is scaling up at the same time, it’s a zero-sum game,” she said.
Business executives have complained that applying for financial aid in Europe is bureaucratic and slow. The Inflation Reduction Act, with its emphasis on tax credits, is simpler and faster, said Tom Einar Jensen, chief executive of the battery maker Freyr, which is building a factory in Mo i Rana, in northern Norway, and has plans to construct more plants in Finland and near Atlanta.
The Inflation Reduction Act has prompted “a dramatic increase in uptick in interest for batteries produced in the U.S.,” Jensen said in an interview.
The future of European auto manufacturing is at stake, particularly for German companies. Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen have already lost market share in China to local automakers like BYD. Chinese automakers, including BYD and SAIC, are also making inroads in Europe. Selling cars under the British brand MG, SAIC has amassed 5% of the European electric vehicle market, putting it ahead of Toyota and Ford in that fast-growing segment.
European carmakers are frantically trying to build the supply chains they need to churn out electric vehicles.
In France, President Emmanuel Macron wants to convert a northern region where factory jobs have been in decline into a hub of battery production.
On Tuesday, Automotive Cells Co., a joint venture between Stellantis, Mercedes-Benz and TotalEnergies, inaugurated a factory in Billy-Berclau Douvrin, France, that aims to produce 300,000 electric batteries annually by the end of 2024. ACC also plans to invest a total of 7.3 billion euros, or $7.8 billion, in Europe, including opening factories in Germany and in Italy, a deal sealed with 1.3 billion euros in public aid.
In Salzgitter, Germany, some 25 miles from Volkswagen’s headquarters, steel beams tower above concrete foundations as excavators and dump trucks hum nearby. In a matter of months, the outlines of a battery factory have risen out of a field.
Volkswagen hopes to have battery-making machines installed before the end of the summer. By 2025, the automaker aims to produce battery cells for up to 500,000 electric vehicles a year — a timeline that the company said was possible only because the factory was being built on land it owned.
Volkswagen is also building a factory in Ontario, but the company made the decision to do so only after the Canadian government matched U.S. incentives.
In Guben, a small city on Germany’s border with Poland, Rock Tech Lithium, a Canadian company, is building a plant to process lithium ore. Mercedes has an agreement with Rock Tech to supply lithium to its battery producers.
These projects won’t reach full production for several years. Recently, the Guben site was an open field. The only construction activity was a truck that dumped loads of crushed rock, making an ear-piercing screech.
Europe has some advantages, including a strong demand for electric cars: About 14% of new cars sold in the EU in the first three months of this year were battery powered, according to Schmidt Automotive Research, twice as many as in the United States.
But if Europe doesn’t move quickly to aid the battery industry, “you will really lose momentum on the ground versus the North American market,” said Dirk Harbecke, chief executive of Rock Tech.
Chinese battery companies have largely avoided the United States for fear of a political backlash. But Chinese battery firms have announced investments in Europe worth $17.5 billion since 2018, according to the Mercator Institute for China Studies and the Rhodium Group.
Political tension between Western governments and China has put German carmakers in a delicate position. They do not want to be overly dependent on Chinese supplies, but they cannot afford to displease the Chinese government.
BMW, Volkswagen and Volvo plan to buy cells from a factory in Arnstadt, Germany, run by CATL, a Chinese company that is currently the world’s largest maker of electric vehicle batteries.

Older Americans
Sour on the Economy
Consumer confidence fell in May as Americans, particularly older ones, became more pessimistic about the labor market, on top of elevated anxiety over inflation.
The Conference Board reportedon Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell to 102.3 in May from 103.7 in April. It's the fourth time in five months that overall consumer confidence has declined.
The business research group's present situation index -- which measures consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions -- fell to 148.6 from 151.8 last month.
The board's expectations index -- a measure of consumers' six-month outlook for income, business and labor conditions -- inched down to 71.5 this month from 71.7 in April.
A reading under 80 often signals a recession in the coming year. The Conference Board noted that reading has come in below 80 every month but one since February 2022. ASSOCIATED PRESS

U.S. Ends Inquiry
Of Tesla Video Games
Highway safety regulators have closed an investigation into Tesla allowing video games to be played on center touch screens while vehicles are moving.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in documents posted Tuesday that Tesla disabled the feature called "passenger play" with an online software update in December of 2021, under pressure from the agency.
The agency said in documents that removing "passenger play" resolved its concerns about distracted driving that could be caused by the feature.
The software update covered more than 580,000 vehicles from the 2017 through 2022 model years.
The agency said it opened the investigation in December of 2021 after getting a complaint from a Tesla owner that games could be played by the driver while the vehicles are moving. The investigation was opened to assess the driver distraction potential.

Automakers Join Forces
On Environmental Tech
The German truck maker Daimler, Japan's top automaker Toyota and two other automakers said on Tuesday they will work together on new technologies, including using hydrogen fuel, to help fight climate change.
The companies said Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corp., whose top stakeholder is Daimler Truck, and Hino Motors, the truck maker in the Toyota group, will merge. Daimler Truck and Toyota Motor Corp. will equally invest in the holding company of the Mitsubishi-Hino merger, they said without giving a dollar amount for the deal.
The companies plan to cooperate in reducing carbon emissions and developing other technologies such as autonomous driving, net-connected services and electric vehicles.
The two truck companies will work on commercial vehicle development, procurement and production to become globally competitive, the executives said.

Full text: In 2018, after 17 seasons of dedicating his life to Formula 1, Fernando Alonso had enough.
With two world titles and 32 Grand Prix victories, he walked away, albeit unfulfilled. It had been 12 years since he was crowned champion and five since he had won a race.
"When I finished, it was on a low, and I didn't want that because my performance, my competitiveness, was as high as ever back then, but people didn't see it," Alonso of Aston Martin said in an interview. "Now, I'm proving I'm still fast, at whatever age -- that's part of the comeback story. Winning the 33rd Grand Prix or fighting for a championship would add even more drama to the story."
After all, he was away from the sport for two years, 2019 and 2020, but during that time he continued to race and rediscovered the joy of winning. He became World Endurance Champion with Toyota, took the checkered flag in the 24 Hours of Daytona, and he won one of the most prestigious races in the world, the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Twice.
Despite his strong start this season, it has been 10 years since Alonso, 41, last won a Grand Prix. Max Verstappen of Red Bull, the reigning two-time champion who leads this year's title race, would like to see Alonso win again.
"I think Fernando should have won a lot more races than he has done," Verstappen said. "I think he deserves a lot more. So I would be quite happy to see him win number 33. But in a way, I would also like to see him win more, so we'll see in the coming races."
Alonso returned to Formula 1 in 2021 with Alpine with moderate success, but midway through last year, his star rose after Sebastian Vettel of Aston Martin, a four-time champion, announced he was retiring. Alonso, an old friend of Lawrence Stroll, the team owner, quickly agreed to a deal.
"I received a phone call from Lawrence asking if I was already committed to Alpine," Alonso said. "I said not yet. My conversations with Alpine were quite advanced, but I didn't have anything on paper.
"He said if I send you something on paper today, you will consider it. He sent it, I was happy, and as I had nothing from the other side, it was an easy decision. Everything was quicker thanks to that relationship over the years."
In an interview, Stroll said he was determined to get Alonso for several reasons. "He is clearly one of the greatest drivers to ever be in Formula 1, and his motivation has never been higher.
"When I spoke to him, he said, 'Listen, I can bring something to this team in my last few years I'm going to drive and hopefully have some sort of role within Aston Martin for many years to come after when I stop driving.' When he said that, I did not need a lot of convincing."
The agreement was built on a friendship forged when Alonso first met Stroll and his then 12-year-old son, Lance, at a go-karting event in Canada in 2011.
Lance Stroll was a member of the Ferrari Driver Academy and Alonso was in his second season of five with the team. Now they are teammates at Aston Martin.
"I wouldn't say we had a relationship back when I was 12," the younger Stroll said. "I was just a fanboy. But yeah, there's a great dynamic in the team at the moment. I definitely enjoy working alongside him. He's incredibly talented, knowledgeable, experienced and hungry to get the most out of himself every day."
Alonso said he remembered first meeting his teammate, saying it's "fun to look back on now. I also remember in my last year with Ferrari in 2014, I stayed at Lawrence's house in north Canada, after the race in Montreal. I was there training for a week.
"I've also visited Lawrence in Monaco on his yacht in the past, and we have had dinner, so we have this kind of relationship, and we have always been in contact."
Alonso said it made it easy for him and Stroll to turn their friendship into "a professional partnership."
Stroll purchased the team in 2018 when it was known as Force India, rebranding it as Racing Point. Two and a half years later, he bought a major stake in the Aston Martin car company, allowing him to return the brand to Formula 1 in 2021 after a 61-year absence.
That year, he said he expected the team to challenge for the world title in five years, helped by the construction of a new factory and wind tunnel at a cost of "over $ 250 million," he said. Staff has increased from "350 people to about 780 today."
Moving into the factory is imminent. The wind tunnel, which will allow the team to aerodynamically test a scale model of a Formula 1 car, will open next spring.
With Alonso's performance, the results are ahead of forecast with the team in second place for the constructors' title.
"When we signed that agreement last year in early August, Fernando didn't know the car was going to be as quick as this," Lawrence Stroll said. "But he did know about all the passion I've put in, the great people I've hired, the great facilities I was building, and he wanted to be a part of it. He believed."
Alonso has been surprised by how quickly he has achieved results. "I trusted the project and felt it was a nice adventure for me at the end of my career, to start with a team that has so much enthusiasm and good prospects," he said.
"But I thought it would take time to reach a certain level," he added, "that maybe in 2024 we can fight for podiums. I was not expecting the car would deliver the kind of performance we have now."
A second retirement and a role with Aston Martin beyond that are far from his thoughts. Alonso is having too much fun again. "I'm aware of my age," he said. "I know I will not be here for the next 10 years, or whatever, so maybe when I stop racing, I will be linked to the team somehow."
He is hopeful that when that day comes again, his wait for win number 33 will be over.
"Winning a championship would be a perfect thing," Alonso said. "If I win another championship all these years since my previous one, that would be unprecedented, that kind of distance between two championships. That is my goal at the moment.
"Or the legacy that I want to leave in this sport, of someone who loves it so much that I kept racing for many years, keeping the level as high as possible. That would prove a point, something that was a part of my comeback."
The team owner is unsurprised that although Alonso is in his 40s, his desire and fitness are strong.
"These guys are gladiators," Stroll said. "The conditioning he has kept himself in physically and mentally and his motivation levels are higher than ever. He's absolutely determined to win. The guy is just a big motivation ball. He's picking everybody up, saying 'Come on, we're going to win."'
Another win, another title are motivations, but he has another desire. "I want to have a family," said Alonso, who is divorced and has no children. "This is my biggest dream in life. I've still not succeeded in that because of my way of living. That's something that when I stop racing, where I will find my happiness."

She's Out to Save Rare Wildflowers, But First She Has to Find Them: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The white Toyota Tacoma bumped along the dirt path, up and down hills, brush scratching the sides of the truck with a high-pitched whine. Naomi Fraga, her hair in pigtail braids under a ball cap, drove like a slightly more cautious Indiana Jones guided by an ancient map.
She stopped the vehicle on a perch overlooking an expanse of boulders and Joshua trees in eastern Kern County, about 170 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
"This is right where they're supposed to be," she said.
Dr. Fraga, 43, was on a treasure hunt, but not for gold or jewels. She was scouring the desert for delicate blooms so tiny that they are called "belly flowers," because botanists must get down on their stomachs to get a proper look at them.
This winter's relentless rain produced a bounty of flowers across California this spring, delighting residents with vibrant color in places like the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve, where visitors have lined up to take selfies with the displays. After unusually wet spells like this, species emerge that haven't been seen in years.
To Dr. Fraga, a botanist with the nonprofit California Botanic Garden in Claremont, this spring affords an extraordinary opportunity to document the existence of rare plant species so that they might be saved from the brink of extinction.
This swath of Central California, where the Sierra Nevada mountains blur into the Mojave Desert, was once part of a vast, untouched landscape. Billions of microscopic seeds lay dormant in the top layer of earth for years, even decades, until conditions were exactly right for them to emerge as wildflowers.
Historically, spring has been marked by a dazzling variety of flowers across the West, each suited for its particular environment. (California, one of the most biodiverse places on the planet, is home to at least 2,400 rare plant species.)
Over time, farms, homes, and off-road vehicles have chipped away at patches of rare-plant habitat -- a hillside here, a meadow there. Climate change has shifted when, where and how much it rains. Even in places where carpets of wildflowers still bloom in wet years, crowds can imperil their future.
So this spring and summer, Dr. Fraga and other rare-plant biologists are in an exhilarating race to find wildflowers before they disappear again.
The botanists' ultimate goal is to secure endangered or rare species designations for the most threatened plants. That can lay the foundation to legally force land managers to make accommodations for threatened species. (For instance, the Center for Biological Diversity has made wildflower protection a key piece of its lengthy fight against development of the Tejon Ranch, where almost 20,000 new homes have been proposed north of Los Angeles.)
In order to get endangered or rare species designations, Dr. Fraga and her colleagues must first prove that the plants still exist. Dr. Fraga may be the only person equipped to do that for the plants she studies, said Katie Heineman, a vice president of the Center for Plant Conservation.
"Without her, there would be no knowledge of that plant species in the entire world," she said. "It's what drives conservation action: Having people who are fully trained looking at these plants in the field."
On this trip, Dr. Fraga was looking for a species known as the Kelso Creek monkeyflower, with blossoms half golden yellow and half rich maroon.
"We each have our pet species," Dr. Fraga said. "I just wish we could do more. We keep talking about the extinction crisis, but we only know if things are going extinct if you keep track of them."
Dr. Fraga sees the broad acceptance of habitat destruction in California as a kind of slippery slope. Each flower represents millenniums of evolution. If we accept the extinction of one obscure monkeyflower, she worries, where might it end? And what consequences might there be for disrupting complex ecosystems?
Each spring, Dr. Fraga and her fellow conservationists, including amateur botany enthusiasts who use apps like iNaturalist, try to document as many rare plant populations as they can.
Scientists must meticulously plan to find targets in peak bloom. If they arrive at a location hours too early, the flowers might still be ensconced in their buds, making them harder to study. If they arrive too late, the flowers may have already shriveled in the heat.
Dr. Fraga homed in on monkeyflowers after stumbling upon a science career she never thought she'd have.
Her father, a Mexican immigrant who worked as a truck driver, thought she should become a kindergarten teacher after she was the first in her family to attend college. But at age 20, a mentor -- also a Mexican American woman -- took her on her first hike, to hunt for a rare herb. Her feet ached from her ill-fitting boots, but she was hooked. Dr. Fraga later felt the thrill of discovery; she has found five new species of monkeyflower.
As a Latina, Dr. Fraga is a trailblazer in a field long dominated by white men, dating to the 1700s when European colonists traveled the world and built collections of exotic plant specimens, many of which are used by scientists today. (The oldest specimen in the California Botanic Garden's collection dates to 1750.)
"It's a complicated legacy," she said, pausing near a patch of purple owl's clover, a native wildflower.
Later on the trail, Dr. Fraga scanned clusters of butter-colored desert dandelion and scale bud, and hustled past lines of pale cream cups. Insects buzzed and lizards darted across her path.
She stopped suddenly. "Oh my god! A hybrid!" she cried.
A Kelso Creek monkeyflower had somehow crossed with a rock jasmine monkeyflower, another close species. She had never seen one in person before. She stopped to photograph the plant and take detailed notes about its features.
"Actually, you're coming with me," she said, after spotting another one. She carried the plant back to the truck, where she pressed it between pages of the Claremont Courier.
But the Kelso Creek monkeyflower, her target for the day, was still proving elusive. She frowned, perplexed. "This is good habitat," she said.
She met up nearby with three of her students, and the group consolidated into two trucks. They splashed through the khaki-tinted Kelso Creek, for which the flowers are named, to check one more location where Dr. Fraga had seen a small bloom of a few hundred plants the year before.
Across the creek, they saw a field that, from afar, looked like green scrub and cactuses. But as they approached, the botanists gazed in astonishment: a sea of petite plants with yellow and maroon flowers rolled ahead. There were millions, the group estimated later.
"It's a micro-super bloom!" gasped Courtney Matzke, 35, one of the students.
They had finally found their flowers. The afternoon sun bore down.
It was time for Dr. Fraga and her students to get to work.

KERN COUNTY, Calif. — The white Toyota Tacoma bumped along the dirt path, up and down hills, brush scratching the sides of the truck with a high-pitched whine. Naomi Fraga, her hair in pigtail braids under a ball cap, drove like a slightly more cautious Indiana Jones guided by an ancient map.

Why Is Inflation So Stubborn? The Car Market Is a Big Reason.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Prices of new and used vehicles were supposed to recede quickly as supply chain problems dissipated. The market had other ideas.
‌Car prices soared after the coronavirus lockdowns, and two years into the United States' worst inflationary episode since the 1980s, the industry demonstrates that getting back to normal will be a long and lurching ride.
In 2021 and early 2022, global shipping problems, a semiconductor shortage and factory shutdowns coincided with strong demand to push vehicle prices sharply higher. Economists had hoped that prices might ease as supply chains healed and the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases deterred borrowers.
Instead, prices for new cars have risen further. Domestic automakers are still producing fewer cars and focusing on more profitable luxury models. Used car prices helped to lower overall inflation late last year, but rebounded in April as short supply collided with a surge in demand.
Echoes from the industry's pandemic disruptions are reverberating through the economy even though the emergency has formally ended, and illustrate why the Fed's fight to quash inflation could be a long one as consumers continued spending despite higher prices.
"Inflation is not going to be a smooth path downward -- there are going to be bumps along the road," said Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price. "There are so many idiosyncratic factors at play right now, and I think some of that has to do with demand post-pandemic."
Elevated car prices have proved uncomfortably sticky. Used car prices have declined, but in a more muted -- and volatile -- fashion than economists had anticipated. And new cars have continued to get more expensive this year as manufacturers strive to maintain the margins established in 2021.
"The big question now is: Are companies going to start competing with one another on price?" Ms. Uruci asked.
But that's a difficult question to answer, because the automotive market has drastically changed. To understand the situation, it's useful to examine how the auto industry worked before.
"Going into the pandemic, the dynamic in the automobile business was this idea that retail profitability was under constant pressure, driven by the internet," said Pat Ryan, the chief executive of CoPilot, a car shopping app that monitors prices across about 40,000 dealerships.
Automakers produced more cars than the marketplace demanded, offering incentives to clear inventory and compete with lower-cost imports. Dealers made their profits on volume and financing, often resulting in customer complaints of excess fees.
As the coronavirus spread, factories shut down. Even when they reopened, semiconductors remained scarce. Manufacturers allocated chips to their highest-priced models -- trucks and sport utility vehicles -- offsetting lower volume with higher profits on each sale. About five million cars that normally would have been produced never were, Mr. Ryan said.
Dealers got in on the action, charging thousands of dollars above list price -- especially as stimulus programs rolled out, and consumers sought to upgrade their vehicles or buy new ones to escape cities. A study by the economist Michael Havlin, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, found that dealer markups accounted for 35 percent to 62 percent of total new-vehicle consumer inflation from 2019 to 2022.
There were downsides to the lower sales volumes; dealerships also make money on service packages years after cars drive off the lot. But on balance, "it was the best of times for car dealers, for sure," Mr. Ryan said.
It was the worst of times, however, for anyone who suddenly needed a car.
That's the position that Hailey Cote of Pittsburgh found herself in last summer. After tiring of low-wage jobs on farms and in restaurants, she built a business cleaning houses for $ 25 an hour. When her 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee broke down, she knew she had to find a replacement quickly to ferry cleaning gear to each job and get to school, where she's pursuing a degree in counseling.
At that point, the used cars she could find were only a few thousand dollars less than the cheapest new cars, so she went with a 2022 base model Toyota Corolla. Her loan payment is about $ 500 a month. Insurance, which has also become more expensive, is another $ 200. Including gas and maintenance, Ms. Cote's transportation cost is almost as much as her rent, leaving nothing for savings or recreation.
"I think it's the basic necessities that are really the worst," Ms. Cote, 29, said. "Food's gone up a bit, but the cost of housing, health care and cars is pretty brutal."
The car price frenzy began to ease in the second half of 2022, as more vehicles started rolling off assembly lines. But the supply has risen only gradually. Automakers, loath to relinquish profits enabled by scarcity, started talking about exercising "discipline" in their production targets.
"During this two-year period, auto dealers and auto manufacturers discovered that a low-volume, higher-price model was actually a very profitable model," Tom Barkin, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said in an interview.
"The experience of higher prices, and the ability to move prices, does broaden the perspectives of business people in terms of what their options are," he said. "It's attractive if you can do it."
One way the automakers tried to buoy prices was jettisoning cheaper models, like the Chevrolet Spark and Volkswagen Passat. Responding to federal subsidies, car companies rolled out electric vehicles, but that didn't help to bring prices down -- they started with luxury versions, like the $ 42,995 Mustang Mach-E.
And there have been added supply constraints. The generation of cars that would typically be coming off three-year leases is smaller than usual. Those who leased cars in the spring of 2020 have an incentive to buy them at the prices that were locked in before everything became more expensive.
On top of that, some rental car companies are aggressively restocking their fleets after being starved for several years, leading dealership groups like Sonic Automotive to complain on earnings calls that they're being outcompeted at auctions.
"There are so many sources of used vehicles that just dried up over the last few years," said Satyan Merchant, a senior vice president for financial services at TransUnion, a credit monitoring company. "And it all has this downstream effect."
The Fed has been raising interest rates sharply to slow demand -- including for cars -- and cool price increases. But during the adjustment period, that is making it even tougher for many Americans to afford a vehicle. According to TransUnion, the average monthly payment for a new car rose to $ 736 in the first quarter of 2023, from $ 585 two years before. Used cars average $ 523 per month, up $ 110 over the same period.
Cars are now a bifurcated market: Demand remains strong on the high end, where wealthy buyers with excess savings from the past two-plus years are able to absorb higher interest rates, or simply pay cash. Some are only now receiving vehicles they ordered in 2022 at inflated prices.
Competition for vehicles is also fierce on the low end, since people with thin financial cushions and in-person jobs can't afford to forgo transportation, which in most of the country is synonymous with a car. The job market has remained strong, especially for in-person jobs in fields like hospitality and health care, so more people have workplaces to get to.
And many people in between, who might switch cars every few years, are waiting for prices to fall.
"What we've seen is the disappearance of the middle," said Scott Kunes, chief operating officer of a dealership group in the Midwest. He faults the automakers for abandoning cheaper, smaller, basic cars that people need just to get around, especially as interest rates put fancier versions beyond reach. "It doesn't make any sense to me at all."
The situation may start to resolve itself soon. Wholesale car prices have begun to fall, and carmakers are offering more incentives. Kelley Blue Book data shows that average prices have fallen below list for the past two months, which Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, said signaled that demand was easing. Prices have come down in recent months for electric cars -- the fastest-growing segment of new car sales, though a small portion of the overall market.
Recent history has shown, however, that pricing trajectories are rarely linear. Adam Jonas, an auto industry analyst with Morgan Stanley, said that over the short to medium term, more inventory was the only answer.
"Even though the statements from the Japanese and the Koreans are that the chip shortage is ending, it takes many months to spool it up," he said. "Dealers should prepare for a tight summer."

Car prices soared after the coronavirus lockdowns, and two years into the U.S.’ worst inflationary episode since the 1980s, the industry demonstrates that getting back to normal will be a long and lurching ride.
In 2021 and early 2022, global shipping problems, a semiconductor shortage and factory shutdowns coincided with strong demand to push vehicle prices sharply higher. Economists had hoped that prices might ease as supply chains healed and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases deterred borrowers.
Instead, prices for new cars have risen further. Domestic automakers are still producing fewer cars and focusing on more profitable luxury models. Used car prices helped to lower overall inflation late last year but rebounded in April as short supply collided with a surge in demand.
Echoes from the industry’s pandemic disruptions are reverberating through the economy, even though the emergency has formally ended, and illustrate why the Fed’s fight to quash inflation could be a long one as consumers continue spending despite higher prices.
“Inflation is not going to be a smooth path downward; there are going to be bumps along the road,” said Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price. “There are so many idiosyncratic factors at play right now, and I think some of that has to do with demand post-pandemic.”
Elevated car prices have proved uncomfortably sticky. Used car prices have declined, but in a more muted — and volatile — fashion than economists had anticipated. And new cars have continued to get more expensive this year as manufacturers strive to maintain the margins established in 2021.
“The big question now is: Are companies going to start competing with one another on price?” Uruci asked.
But that’s a difficult question to answer, because the automotive market has drastically changed. To understand the situation, it’s useful to examine how the auto industry worked before.
“Going into the pandemic, the dynamic in the automobile business was this idea that retail profitability was under constant pressure, driven by the internet,” said Pat Ryan, CEO of CoPilot, a car shopping app that monitors prices across about 40,000 dealerships.
Automakers produced more cars than the marketplace demanded, offering incentives to clear inventory and compete with lower-cost imports. Dealers made their profits on volume and financing, often resulting in customer complaints of excess fees.
As the coronavirus spread, factories shut down. Even when they reopened, semiconductors remained scarce. Manufacturers allocated chips to their highest-priced models — trucks and SUVs — offsetting lower volume with higher profits on each sale. About 5 million cars that normally would have been produced never were, Ryan said.
Dealers got in on the action, charging thousands of dollars above list price — especially as stimulus programs rolled out, and consumers sought to upgrade their vehicles or buy new ones to escape cities. A study by economist Michael Havlin, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, found that dealer markups accounted for 35% to 62% of total new-vehicle consumer inflation from 2019 to 2022.
There were downsides to the lower sales volumes; dealerships also make money on service packages years after cars drive off the lot. But on balance, “it was the best of times for car dealers, for sure,” Ryan said.
It was the worst of times, however, for anyone who suddenly needed a car.
That’s the position that Hailey Cote of Pittsburgh found herself in last summer. After tiring of low-wage jobs on farms and in restaurants, she built a business cleaning houses for $25 an hour. When her 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee broke down, she knew she had to find a replacement quickly to ferry cleaning gear to each job and get to school, where she’s pursuing a degree in counseling.
At that point, the used cars she could find were only a few thousand dollars less than the cheapest new cars, so she went with a 2022 base model Toyota Corolla. Her loan payment is about $500 a month. Insurance, which has also become more expensive, is another $200. Including gas and maintenance, Cote’s transportation cost is almost as much as her rent, leaving nothing for savings or recreation.
“I think it’s the basic necessities that are really the worst,” Cote, 29, said. “Food’s gone up a bit, but the cost of housing, health care and cars is pretty brutal.”
The car price frenzy began to ease in the second half of 2022 as more vehicles started rolling off assembly lines. But the supply has risen only gradually. Automakers, loath to relinquish profits enabled by scarcity, started talking about exercising “discipline” in their production targets.
“During this two-year period, auto dealers and auto manufacturers discovered that a low-volume, higher-price model was actually a very profitable model,” Tom Barkin, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said in an interview.
“The experience of higher prices, and the ability to move prices, does broaden the perspectives of businesspeople in terms of what their options are,” he said. “It’s attractive if you can do it.”
One way the automakers tried to buoy prices was jettisoning cheaper models, like the Chevrolet Spark and Volkswagen Passat. Responding to federal subsidies, car companies rolled out electric vehicles, but that didn’t help to bring prices down; they started with luxury versions, like the $42,995 Mustang Mach-E.
And there have been added supply constraints. The generation of cars that would typically be coming off three-year leases is smaller than usual. Those who leased cars in spring 2020 have an incentive to buy them at the prices that were locked in before everything became more expensive.
On top of that, some rental car companies are aggressively restocking their fleets after being starved for several years, leading dealership groups like Sonic Automotive to complain on earnings calls that they’re being outcompeted at auctions.
“There are so many sources of used vehicles that just dried up over the last few years,” said Satyan Merchant, a senior vice president for financial services at TransUnion, a credit monitoring company. “And it all has this downstream effect.”
The Fed has been raising interest rates sharply to slow demand — including for cars — and cool price increases. But during the adjustment period, that is making it even tougher for many Americans to afford a vehicle. According to TransUnion, the average monthly payment for a new car rose to $736 in the first quarter of 2023, from $585 two years before. Used cars average $523 per month, up $110 over the same period.
Cars are now a bifurcated market: Demand remains strong on the high end, where wealthy buyers with excess savings from the past two-plus years are able to absorb higher interest rates or simply pay cash. Some are only now receiving vehicles they ordered in 2022 at inflated prices.
Competition for vehicles is also fierce on the low end, since people with thin financial cushions and in-person jobs can’t afford to forgo transportation, which in most of the country is synonymous with a car. The job market has remained strong, especially for in-person jobs in fields like hospitality and health care, so more people have workplaces to get to.
And many people in between, who might switch cars every few years, are waiting for prices to fall.
“What we’ve seen is the disappearance of the middle,” said Scott Kunes, chief operating officer of a dealership group in the Midwest. He faults the automakers for abandoning cheaper, smaller, basic cars that people need just to get around, especially as interest rates put fancier versions beyond reach. “It doesn’t make any sense to me at all.”
The situation may start to resolve itself soon. Wholesale car prices have begun to fall, and carmakers are offering more incentives. Kelley Blue Book data shows that average prices have fallen below list for the past two months, which Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, said signaled that demand was easing. Prices have come down in recent months for electric cars — the fastest-growing segment of new car sales, though a small portion of the overall market.
Recent history has shown, however, that pricing trajectories are rarely linear. Adam Jonas, an auto industry analyst with Morgan Stanley, said that over the short to medium term, more inventory was the only answer.
“Even though the statements from the Japanese and the Koreans are that the chip shortage is ending, it takes many months to spool it up,” he said. “Dealers should prepare for a tight summer.”

Musk Warns Tesla Investors Of 'Challenging' Year Ahead: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Tesla will not escape the effects of a global economic downturn, Mr. Musk said at the carmaker's annual meeting. But he insisted Tesla would emerge stronger.
Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, warned shareholders Tuesday to expect a difficult year because of an unsteady global economy and high interest rates.
"This is going to be a challenging 12 months," Mr. Musk said at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting. He added, "Tesla is not immune to the global economic environment."
Mr. Musk's pessimistic forecast came in an otherwise upbeat presentation to a friendly crowd at Tesla's factory in Austin, Texas. He largely ignored criticism by activist investors on a variety of issues, including allegations of racial discrimination at its California factory, and whether the company was hostile to labor unions or its board was doing a good job overseeing management.
He did, however, respond to activists by promising that Tesla would investigate whether any suppliers of cobalt, a battery raw material, were using child labor.
"We will do a third-party audit," he said, shortly after Courtney Wicks, the executive director of Investor Advocates for Social Justice, asked shareholders to vote in favor of an inquiry into cobalt mining.
"In fact," Mr. Musk said, "we'll put a webcam on the mine. If anybody sees any children, please let us know."
Shareholders confirmed the company's nomination of J.B. Straubel to its board despite criticism from activist investors that he was too close to Mr. Musk. Last month eight investment funds and activist groups called on Tesla shareholders to reject the nomination of Mr. Straubel, who was a senior executive at Tesla for years before leaving to start a battery recycling and materials company in 2019. Mr. Straubel "is clearly a company insider and not an appropriate choice for a board that already has a dearth of independence," the investors wrote.
Activists also complained that they were not able to introduce as many shareholder proposals as they did at previous shareholder meetings because of what they characterized as a deliberate attempt by the automaker to suppress dissent.
In October, Tesla moved up its annual meeting from August to May and gave shareholders two fewer months to file proposals. Tesla announced the new deadline for proposals, Dec. 22, at the end of a 60-page regulatory filing, and most activist investors overlooked the change.
"It was really sneaky," said Kristin Hull, the chief executive of Nia Impact Capital, a firm in Oakland, Calif., that previously challenged a Tesla policy requiring employees to resolve complaints of discrimination before an arbitrator rather than in court.
Tesla did nothing wrong in moving up the deadline, according to a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr. Musk and Tesla's board members have dismissed activists' complaints about discrimination and pointed to the company's strong profits and sales growth as evidence that it is performing exceedingly well.
Some investors saw signs that Mr. Musk was responsive to some of the shareholder criticism when he announced last week that he would name Linda Yaccarino as chief executive of Twitter, the social media company that Mr. Musk acquired last year. Hiring Ms. Yaccarino could free Mr. Musk to spend more time managing Tesla. Investors have complained that Twitter has distracted Mr. Musk from Tesla at a time when the carmaker faces slackening demand and increased competition, which have led it to cut prices.
Tesla also faces criticism from Washington. A group of eight senators led by Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, called on Tesla this month to stop requiring employees and car buyers to resolve complaints before arbitrators.
The practice, the letter said, "prevents workers and consumers from bringing discrimination claims and consumer safety complaints to court -- effectively shielding the company from both accountability and public scrutiny."
Mr. Musk was clearly more interested in talking about Tesla's plans to eventually make 20 million cars, twice as many as the world's largest automaker, Toyota, produces in a typical year. He said Tesla would unveil two new models soon, without giving details. And he insisted that, when the economic downturn is over in a year or so, Tesla would be stronger than its competitors.
"The good times follow the bad times," he said.

Two Creative Titans Share a Deep Faith In Being Authentic: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For the Taking the Lead series, we asked leaders in various fields to share insights on what they've learned and what lies ahead.
The birth of the partnership between the creative directors Free Richardson and Phil Cho hinged on, of all things, their shared faith. In 2018, Mr. Cho, the founder of NoLedge Productions, pitched a collaboration between his company and Mr. Richardson's creative agency the Compound.
"I go to slide two, and he goes, 'Yo. Turn that off,"' Mr. Cho recently recalled. "He's like, 'Do you love God?' I was like, 'Yeah. I'm a believer,' and he goes, 'All right. We're good."'
Of course, it wasn't just spirituality that brought them together. Mr. Richardson also was impressed with the effort Mr. Cho showed when documenting an event through photos and videos at the Compound's art gallery. "Phil has something special about him," Mr. Richardson said recently. "You can just feel a good presence of energy."
The two companies are now a major force in the world of marketing, particularly around the intersection of sports and hip-hop. Together, they have curated an impressive portfolio of campaigns for brands including the shoe company Clarks, ESPN, the software company Niantic and DraftKings. Last year, the duo won two Cannes Lions and one Cannes Dolphin advertising awards and five Muse Creative Awards, given for inspirational marketing campaigns. Last month, they won 12 Clio Awards, given for creativity in advertising.
Mr. Richardson, 50, also known as Set Free, is African American and was born in the Bronx. He grew up in Queens and Philadelphia and was deeply involved in the hip-hop community and the world of street basketball culture. In 1998, he created the AND1 Mixtape, a video compilation documenting a traveling basketball competition, and in 2007, he founded the Compound.
Mr. Richardson's story has helped shape and inspire many, including Mr. Cho.
Born and raised in Edison, N.J., Mr. Cho, 33, is Korean American and grew up with a passion for both basketball and hip-hop music. He was a middle school student when the AND1 Mixtape Tour debuted. ("Some moms in Korea probably know about AND1," Mr. Cho said about the tour's reach.) Since starting NoLedge at the age of 26, he has collaborated with a variety of brands including Toyota, the record label 300 Entertainment and musicians like Akon and Year of the Ox.
Today, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Cho are innovators in the crowded landscape of creative marketing, and consider themselves family as they "navigate the invisible handcuffs of corporate rule," as Mr. Richardson put it.
"Authenticity is a word that gets thrown around a lot in our industry," Ari Weiss, chief creative officer at the advertising agency DDB Worldwide, wrote in an email. But "you're either authentic or you're not. Mr. Free Richardson and Mr. Phil Cho are pure authenticity."
The two spoke at the Compound's headquarters in Brooklyn to discuss remaining authentic to their craft, being relevant and their shared faith. The conversation has been edited and condensed.
How do you stay current?
FREE RICHARDSON I think it always goes back to staying authentic and storytelling. Everybody has a story, and you can tell it through A.I., pictures, music, all the creative elements. Look at the NFT [nonfungible token] world. It came, and though it's not gone, the whole time, I was like, I'm still going to go with touchable, feel-able art. Authenticity within. Look at a tree. The leaves will die before the root of the tree dies. A lot of things are happening through technology, and a lot of things are going to happen, but I don't know anything that is bigger than the Mona Lisa. No matter what happens in technology, the root of creativity will always be around.
PHIL CHO The root of what we are is: It's always been about relationships. When I walk into the Compound, and I see all this artwork, like Jonni Cheatwood, and you see how long it took for them to come up with these ideas and wasn't A.I.-generated, I feel like that's what drives more value.
RICHARDSON Yeah, I think it's a lot of relationships. That's with everything. The two things in life are communication and relationships. If we don't communicate, you can't make the relationship. Creativity is a revolving door. I still work with people that I worked with 20 years ago. It's the reason we still hear Fleetwood Mac and Marvin Gaye songs in the same rotation that you hear Drake. And so when things are authentic and true, the creativity never goes away.
How are you navigating challenges and opportunities facing the advertising industry?
RICHARDSON I think the ratio of African Americans and Asians is very small. I don't blame everything on race, but I think it's a tougher role for me and Phil being a minority, because there's not a lot of dominance of minorities in the advertising agency world, especially with Fortune 500 companies, C-suite level and businesses, especially small ones. [According to a 2022 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics survey, of workers in "advertising, public relations, and related services," 7.8 percent were African American and 6.6 percent were Asian American.] We're kind of small, SWAT-style -- boutique-small.
That's what I consider Compound and NoLedge. It's a strategic partnership that executes some of the same things that big advertising agencies execute, without the red tape.
CHO Before doing Compound, there weren't people telling me how to facilitate production, and I felt like I had to just learn from trial and error. And a lot of the people that I would meet, they did happen to be white. So again, I'm not trying to make it a race thing either, but I just felt like there's not a lot of people with my skin tone that are doing this and can help me out. So I think even merging with the Compound, it was a whole new world for me of just trying to be confident in what I'm doing and understanding that.
What's a lesson that you learned from your staff, team or peers?
RICHARDSON At the end of the day, everybody makes mistakes. And myself, just looking people in the eye and just being like, "All of us are the same." I think learning and working with NoLedge, it takes time. Everybody needs time -- to execute a task, to learn, to communicate, to talk. To respect time and respect people and giving them time. Not to where you just want to get them to or the client, but just everybody needs time.
CHO With the guys that are in NoLedge, for me, it's patience. I'll say this, but it's harder to practice it. You might be able to do X, Y and Z, and you want the same from your guys, but you got to understand that they also need to learn X, Y and Z first. So you can't expect people to move how you move.
How do you keep campaigns authentic and meaningful?
RICHARDSON I try to give everybody their own white box. When you go look at an apartment, you'd rather see the apartment empty so you can dream of how you're going to decorate and design it. But if you go into a home that's already furnished, it already blocks you in. You can't really put your ideas on it. And so walking into brands and working with companies, I try to give them the white box and tell them, "How do you want to design this?"
And then my job after that is just to put a magnifying glass on your ideas. You're there to help the brand, not really to put your ideas on their brands. And doing it that way, it always helps expand what the goal is. The goal is not for my ideas to be presented. The goal is for my ideas to latch onto your ideas and make them bigger.
CHO I really do feel like Free kind of sets his own trend. And I think that's what a real creative is, right? To me, the better creative director you are, the more you don't care about what other people think about you, and I think that's given me confidence, too. It's just what comes out of when we facilitate a project -- just do what we feel would be dope. Just be comfortable with it.
What are the challenges of a partnership?
RICHARDSON Time. We can't do everything we want to do. I mean, you have to understand what you're going into with partnerships. It's like a marriage. Phil, I love him. He's my brother, my little cousin and a son. Then there's times that he's my uncle. I got to look up to him in certain areas.
CHO It's always about communicating. People have different work flows. It's not like mine is exactly the same as Free's. But I think the reason this works is so many young guys want to run the ship, right? So even while doing production, there's certain things that I would do differently if I was shooting. But at the same time, a good leader is a good follower. I feel like these years right now, I'm soaking up the game. The same way Free was talking about clients and how you got to support their vision. I'm kind of doing a similar thing with Free. I'm supporting his vision.
How do you stay inspired?
RICHARDSON God. I want the world to understand that. He's just the creator of all. If you can't be inspired by thinking of that, I don't know what else you're going to be inspired by. God is my source of creativity.
CHO I agree. All the stories in this world from different people and backgrounds -- he's the biggest artist.

Russian Elites Still Obtaining Luxury Goods: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: More than a year into Vladimir Putin's invasion, the web of global trade has adjusted to Western sanctions, with a network of middlemen sending cars, electronics and more to Russia.
On a dusty roadside on the outskirts of Dubai, Sohrab Fani is profiting from the West's response to the war in Ukraine: his shop installs seat heaters into cars being re-exported to Russia.
Twelve thousand heating pads languished in his warehouse for years, he said, until Russia's invasion and the resulting Western sanctions drove American, European and Japanese automakers out of the Russian market. Now, Russians import those cars via Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates -- and because cars shipped to the Middle East tend to be made for warm climates, accessories shops like Mr. Fani's are doing a brisk business outfitting them for winter weather.
"When the Russians came, I sold out," Mr. Fani said, so he ordered several thousand more seat-heating pads. "In Russia, they have sanctions. Here, there is not. Here, there is business."
More than a year into President Vladimir V. Putin's invasion, Western sanctions have damaged Russia's economy but not crippled it. The web of global trade has adjusted, allowing the Russian leader to largely deliver on a key promise: that the war would not drastically disrupt the lifestyle of consumption for Russian elites.
Russia is still importing coveted Western goods, enabled by a global network of middlemen.
In Moscow, the latest iPhones are available for same-day delivery for less than the retail price in Europe. Department stores still stock Gucci, Prada and Burberry. Car-sales sites list new Land Rovers, Audis and BMWs.
Just about all of the West's leading electronics, automobile and luxury brands announced last year that they were pulling out of Russia. Not all of their goods technically violate sanctions, but commerce with Russia became very difficult in the face of public outrage, pressure from employees, and restrictions on semiconductor exports and financial transactions.
Still, Russian demand for luxury items remains strong, and traders in Dubai and elsewhere are meeting it.
"The wealthy people always stay wealthy," said Ecaterina Condratiuc, the director of communications at a Dubai luxury car showroom who recently shipped a $ 300,000 Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT to a Russian dealership. The war, she added, "did not affect them."
In Dubai, buyers roam the showrooms of a sprawling auto market, haggling for Western cars -- the Dodge Ram is a recent favorite -- to purchase in cash and ship to Russia. Some are wealthy Russians buying vehicles for themselves, or small-time entrepreneurs looking to resell cars for a quick buck.
In other cases, Russian car dealerships, having lost their official affiliations with Western brands, are organizing their own imports, sometimes of hundreds of cars at a time.
The Russian analytics company Autostat reported that such indirect imports accounted for 12 percent of the 626,300 new passenger cars sold in Russia in 2022.
Electronics also take circuitous routes to the Russian market. In Dubai's old commercial neighborhood, Deira, electronics wholesalers have scrambled to recruit Russian-speaking staff.
"It's an open secret thing," said the owner of Bright Zone International General Trading L.L.C., a few storefronts down from a wholesaler of hair extensions. "Competition is very tough right now for Russia."
The owner, who requested that he only be identified by his last name, Tura, said he shipped hundreds of smartphones and laptops into Russia last year ahead of the holiday season. One potential buyer wanted a quote for 15,000 iPhones, Mr. Tura said, but apparently found a better deal elsewhere.
In another electronics shop nearby, an Afghan salesman, Abdullah Ahmadzai, said he had arrived in Dubai less than a year earlier, and had since learned enough Russian to negotiate with his Russian-speaking customers. Across the street, a man from Tajikistan, a former Soviet republic, said he and his colleague quickly found employment in a shop selling phones, laptops and drones.
"All the stores here are looking for people who speak Russian," he said. "We got lucky."
After many Western companies pulled out of Russia, Mr. Putin's government encouraged unauthorized imports of their goods from other countries. The Russian trade ministry published a list of dozens of companies whose products could be imported without their makers' consent, including Apple, Audi, Volvo and Yamaha.
"Whoever wants to bring in whatever luxury goods will be able to do it," Mr. Putin pledged last May.
One Russian report estimated that such "parallel imports" of laptops, tablets and smartphones totaled $ 1.5 billion last year. At the same time, Chinese cars and electronics have flooded onto the Russian market.
"You can bring over whatever you want, as long as you have money," said Pyotr Bakanov, an auto journalist based in Moscow. "Everyone who isn't lazy is bringing cars over."
The new trade routes largely pass through countries that have friendly relations with Moscow. Western analysts and officials have pointed to Turkey, China and former Soviet republics like Armenia and Kazakhstan as countries redirecting Western goods to Russia. They say that the Kremlin is taking advantage of those imports not just to mollify a populace used to foreign phones and cars, but also to source microchips for weapons used against Ukraine.
Mr. Bakanov, like other Russian car bloggers and journalists, has gotten into the business himself: he posts advertisements on the messaging app Telegram, offering to import cars "to order from any part of the world." He said that foreign car parts are also coming in via parallel import -- some are now available in Russia for lower prices than before the war, when those parts were sold by authorized dealers charging high premiums.
The workarounds have become so widespread that Russian car publications run regular reviews of cars made for foreign markets. The multimedia console in the Toyota Camry made for China only operates in Chinese, a popular auto website warned in February; the reviewer suggested holding a smartphone translating app up to the display.
In the Dubai car market one March evening, Sergei Kashkarov sat in the passenger seat of a parked gray Toyota, negotiating his latest deal: sending six Mitsubishi cars to a dealership in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk by ferry and truck, via Iran and Kazakhstan. Mr. Kashkarov had moved to Dubai from Siberia in 2021 and, after the invasion, established himself as a broker connecting Russian car dealers with Dubai suppliers.
"I've got plenty of work," he said. "I'm really not complaining."
The new trade patterns show up in international statistics; car exports from the European Union to Russia, for instance, dropped to about 1 billion euros in 2022, from 5 billion euros in 2021.
But E.U. exports to Kazakhstan rose nearly fourfold, to more than 700 million euros, and exports to the Emirates rose some 40 percent, to 2.4 billion euros. Armenia reports that its car imports more than quintupled to $ 712 million last year.
Western car companies generally deny knowledge of their cars going to Russia in any significant quantities, or of a spike in sales in the Emirates.
"We haven't seen any of that," said Jim Rowan, the chief executive of Volvo.
Paul Jacobson, the chief financial officer of General Motors, said, "I'm not aware of anything going to Russia."
Carmakers would have trouble tracking sales of vehicles through intermediaries, industry officials say. And U.S. officials responsible for enforcing restrictions have focused more on goods that can be used for military purposes.
The United Arab Emirates has been identified as a "country of focus" by U.S. officials for its role as a hub for products shipped to Russia in violation of sanctions. Electronics are of particular concern, officials say, because their chips can be repurposed for military use.
"The U.A.E. has strict measures in place governing import and export permits for dual-use materials to prevent their exploitation for military purposes," an Emirati official said in a statement.
Browsing in Dubai's auto market, a group of three men said they split their time between Russia and Armenia. They refused to say what they did for a living but they described the import and resale of cars as a lucrative side business; one said he had bought around 100 cars in the last year.
"Dubai is a three-in-one," a man who gave his name as Aik quipped. "You go on vacation, you buy a car for yourself, and you buy some to resell."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some of the dead and injured belonged to the same families. The Mendoza sisters, in elementary school, both died.
Cindy and Kyu Cho brought their two little boys to the Allen Premium Outlets to exchange a birthday present that didn't fit their older son, who had just turned 6.
Sisters Daniela and Sofia Mendoza, both in elementary school, were there with their mother.
Aishwarya Thatikonda had come to shop with a friend before she had to head to a job site for her work at a general contracting firm.
A warm sunny day brought crowds and clusters of families to the sprawling outdoor mall in an upscale suburb north of Dallas for the most American of activities. On Saturday, it became different kind of all-American scene: the location of yet another mass shooting. By the time a police officer shot and killed the gunman, eight people had suffered fatal wounds, including three small children. At least seven other people were injured.
It was the country's second-deadliest mass shooting this year, indiscriminately wiping out individuals, and nearly one entire family.
Both the Mendoza sisters, 11 and 8, were killed. Their mother was shot and is hospitalized. The Cho parents and their 3-year-old, James, died. Their 6-year-old, William, was shot and survived.
Ms. Thatikonda, 26, died, as did a security guard named Christian LaCour, who was 20. Elio Cumana-Rivas, a 32-year-old man from Dallas, was also killed, the state's Department of Public Safety said on Monday.
The gunman appeared to embrace white supremacist ideology, based on social media accounts investigators believe belong to him. Yet his motive is unclear.
The region has become a magnet for Asians, especially South Asians, many of them professionals who work for the multitude of large corporations based in nearby Plano and Frisco.
About 25 miles outside Dallas, Allen is one of the booming suburbs north of the city whose populations have exploded in recent years. The surrounding area is home to a number of large American corporations, including the PGA in Frisco, which was named the fastest-growing large city in the nation by the Census Bureau in 2020.
Allen, a former railroad town, is now home to a $ 60 million stadium that holds 18,000 people, called by ESPN "the palace of high-school football" when it opened a decade ago. Allen has continued to grow since then, topping 100,000 people in the 2020 census.
"We are one of the safest cities in the state and country, even though this person randomly chose to visit our city to deliver evil," Allen's mayor, Kenneth Fulk, said in an email. He declined further comment.
The Chos, a Korean American family, lived in a two-story house in a newer neighborhood in Dallas, 14 miles south of the outlet mall.
Mr. Cho worked as an immigration lawyer at a firm in Richardson, Texas. A profile for Mr. Cho on the firm's website said he was born in South Korea in the early 1990s and raised in Dallas. "As an immigrant himself, Kyu has a deep pride, respect, and appreciation for the American Dream," the profile says. Mr. Cho was learning Spanish because he represented many Spanish-speaking immigrants in court.
In his free time, the profile said, he participated in church activities and enjoyed "watching his two young boys grow up."
Their neighbor, Kristy Kim, has a son the same age as William, the 6-year-old who survived. The two families had attended birthday parties and neighborhood play dates together since 2018, when the subdivision was built. The families both attended New Song Church, a large Korean Baptist congregation in nearby Carrollton.
"They were quiet and reserved," Ms. Kim said on Monday. "They were definitely homebodies, but they were so kind."
The area north of Dallas is one of the places where "Asian immigrants are the driving force of growth," as Texas Monthly put it in a 2021 cover story on "The Newest Texans."
The Dallas area has the state's largest Korean American and Indian populations, according to the Pew Research Center in 2019. Hindu temples dot the suburban landscape north of the city. And Dallas recently unveiled bilingual street signs in an older area informally known as Koreatown; "New Koreatown" is in Carrollton, with an H Mart and plentiful restaurants.
State Representative Mihaela Plesa represents the district where the Cho family lived. The area includes parts of Allen, Plano, Richardson and Dallas. More than half of the population identify as minorities and the largest demographic is Asian, said Ms. Plesa's chief of staff, Karrol Rimal.
The makeup has changed, especially in recent years, because of a population growth that is pushing some people out of Dallas and further into the suburbs. Several companies have moved their headquarters to the area in recent years, including Toyota nearly a decade ago.
"Ten to 20 years ago, this was underdeveloped," Mr. Rimal said. "Twenty to 30 years ago, it was rural. Now it's suburban, almost urban."
Daniela Mendoza, a fourth-grader, and her sister Sofia, a second-grader, were students an elementary school in Wylie, a city southeast of Allen, David Vinson, superintendent of the Wylie Independent School District, said in an email to parents.
Their mother, Ilda, was in critical condition on Monday, Mr. Vinson said.
"Our love for our kiddos and each other will get us through this," Mr. Vinson wrote. "Daniela and Sofia will not be forgotten. Hug your kids, and tell them you love them."
Flags at the girls' school, Cheri Cox Elementary, flew at half-staff on Monday. Krista Wilson, the principal, called the girls "rays of sunshine."
Aishwarya Thatikonda worked at a general contracting firm in Frisco, where her boss, Srinivas Chaluvadi, described her as being like a goddaughter to him. Ms. Thatikonda celebrated family birthdays at his house, and came to see him for a traditional Hindu blessing on her own birthday, which was coming up again next week. Last year, he accompanied her to her brother's wedding in India.
On Saturday, Mr. Chaluvadi received a call from an architect waiting on a job site for Ms. Thatikonda, who had uncharacteristically not shown up on time. He drove to her house in McKinney, which she shared with several roommates, then to the mall, and eventually to several local hospitals. It was not until Sunday that she was confirmed as one of the victims.
Mr. Chaluvadi described Ms. Thatikonda as a diligent worker who was "indispensable" to his firm. She also hoped to marry later this year, he said; her parents were in the process of "finding a suitable boy for her." Instead, they are now arranging to bring her body back home to Hyderabad.
Ashok Kolla, treasurer of the Telugu Association of North America, an organization that serves Indian Americans, is working with Ms. Thatikonda's family in India on that complex process. He said she had several cousins in the Dallas area, but no immediate family here.
"She came here with a lot of dreams," he said.
Mr. Kolla said he had advice for international students and other young immigrant workers in the United States: "Be cautious wherever they go," he said, and "carry emergency contacts to make it easier for law enforcement to contact their family."

Braving Street Battles in Sudan, 2 Taxi Drivers Rescue Dozens of Stranded People: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the first days of Sudan's war, the two university students felt helpless.
They locked themselves into their apartment in the capital, Khartoum, glued to Twitter as the battle unfolded. They winced as the walls shuddered from blasts and gunfire, taking shelter in the corridor. They wondered where Sudan was going.
On the fifth day, April 19, the phone rang: Someone needed a taxi.
A senior United Nations official, a woman in her 40s, was trapped inside her home in an upscale neighborhood, the caller explained. Her situation was desperate. Pickup trucks mounted with machine guns stood outside her building, firing at warplanes that zoomed overhead. Black smoke was streaming into her apartment following an airstrike nearby. She had run out of water. Her cellphone battery was down to 5 percent. Could they rescue her?
The students, Hassan Tibwa and Sami al-Gada, in their final year of mechanical engineering, had a side gig driving a taxi. But this call wasn't a paying job -- it was a mercy run. Mr. Tibwa phoned the woman. "She was screaming," he recalled. "We had only a few minutes before her phone died. She was on her own."
They jumped into Mr. al-Gada's car, a dinged, seven-year-old Toyota sedan, and set off into the city, horrified at its transformation. Bullet holes pocked buildings. Charred vehicles littered the streets. Fighters were everywhere.
Crunching over bullet casings, they navigated a gantlet of check posts manned by jittery fighters from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, some wearing bandages or limping. The fighters scanned the students' phones and peppered them with questions. It took an hour to travel four miles.
"We went through hell," Mr. Tibwa said.
They found the U.N. official, named Patience, alone at her apartment in an apparently deserted building. She had been hiding in her bathroom for days, slowly depleting three cellphones, she said, showing them a scatter of bullet holes in her living room wall.
The students consoled her, wrapped her in an all-covering abaya robe, and devised a cover story: Their passenger was pregnant and needed to get to a hospital. They paused to say a prayer. "We knew that the moment we stepped out, there was no going back," Mr. Tibwa said.
Forty-five minutes and 10 check posts later, their Toyota pulled up outside the Al Salam, one of Khartoum's most expensive hotels, now a five-star refugee camp. Patience wept with relief. After collecting herself and checking in, she sat the students down to ask an urgent question.
Could they go back and rescue her friends too?
Over the following week, Mr. Tibwa, 25, and Mr. al-Gada, 23, rescued dozens of desperate people from one of Khartoum's fiercest battle zones, according to interviews with the students, those they extracted and hundreds of text messages. Along the way they were robbed, handcuffed and threatened with execution. Fighters accused them of being spies. Diplomats implored them to retrieve their passports and pets. Shellfire and stray bullets fell around their car.
"The bravery of these guys is just amazing," said Fares Hadi, an Algerian factory manager who survived a hair-raising ride with them through Khartoum. "So impressive, so courageous."
Every rescuee interviewed said the students had not asked for payment.
Over six days, as the war surged between two feuding military factions -- the army and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group -- the students helped at least 60 people: South African teachers, Rwandan diplomats, Russian aid workers and U.N. workers from many countries, including Kenya, Zimbabwe, Sweden and the United States. Ten passengers said the students had swooped to their aid at terrifying, life-threatening moments, when large organizations with drivers and security guards were nowhere to be found.
"The only word for them is heroes," one U.N. official said.
Like most U.N. employees interviewed, the official spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid publicly criticizing an organization that, by many accounts, failed to rescue its own employees, even those facing immediate danger.
"Despite all the chaos, the fear, the bombing," he said, "Sami and Hassan were the ones who turned up."
From Students to Rescuers
Even as Mr. Tibwa drove strangers to safety, his own family didn't know he was in Sudan.
He arrived in 2017 from Tanzania, where his family runs a modest hardware store at a small town on Lake Victoria. An Islamic charity provided a scholarship to study engineering at the International University of Africa in Khartoum.
But he told his parents that he was going to study in Algeria, in deference to their concerns about Sudan's history of violent unrest -- a lie he easily maintained for six years, because he never had enough money to go home.
Mr. al-Gada is Sudanese, but was raised in a sleepy town in northeastern Saudi Arabia, where his father was a car mechanic.
Classmates in university, the two young men soon became friends. They shared a bright, open disposition and a gritty entrepreneurial streak, working odd jobs at night to make rent. Mr. Tibwa drove a taxi that catered mostly to African U.N. officials, with whom he also socialized.
"Everyone knew Hassan," said one Kenyan. "An outstanding gentleman."
Sudan's turbulent politics disrupted their ambition. Classes were canceled for much of 2019 when roaring protesters, including Mr. al-Gada, helped topple President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, Sudan's dictator of 30 years.
Then in October 2021, Sudan's two most powerful military leaders -- Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan of the army and Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan of the R.S.F. -- joined forces to boot out the civilian prime minister and seize power for themselves in a coup. Protests flared. The economy tanked.
The two students thought little, at first, of the shots that rang out across Khartoum early on April 15 this year: Anti-military demonstrators had been clashing with riot police for over a year.
But when Mr. al-Gada went to campus to submit a paper, the guards sent him home. This time it was not a protest, they said. It was war.
Months of tension between Sudan's ruling generals exploded into gunfights between rival units that quickly spread to the city center, concentrated around the military headquarters and the international airport.
That zone also happened to abut two of Khartoum's most expensive districts: Khartoum 2, known as K2, and al-Amarat, which were filled with embassies, U.N. offices and the homes of foreigners and well-heeled Sudanese. The area also contained several R.S.F. bases. Fighters surged through its streets, taking up positions on rooftops, breaking into homes and, in some cases, robbing their occupants.
The European Union ambassador was assaulted inside his house. A shell landed outside the British ambassador's front door but failed to explode. An American convoy came under fire.
The United Nations, like most organizations, ordered its 800 employees and dependents in Khartoum to "shelter in place." But although its security division rescued a handful of people in the first days of fighting, it soon stopped.
The U.N. had only a few armored vehicles, which were shot at or stolen, several officials said. Drivers refused to work, effectively grounding the fleet. In a conference call on Day 6 of the fighting, the U.N. security chief in Khartoum told colleagues that his department could no longer rescue anyone.
"The message was: 'You're on your own,"' said one of two senior U.N. officials who recounted that call.
Mr. Tibwa and Mr. al-Gada were not the only rescuers. Local Resistance Committees, formed years earlier to push Sudan toward democracy, pivoted to helping Sudanese and foreigners flee.
But for some stricken residents, the two students were the only option.
"They called us," Mr. Tibwa said. "They didn't have food. They had no power. Their phones were going down. We tried to imagine ourselves in that same situation. So we went out."
Hours after delivering Patience, the two students received an S.O.S. from another U.N. official. The guards at her building had vanished, and the R.S.F. had given residents three hours to get out.
"Plan to occupy the building," she texted, describing her predicament with an expletive. "I'm resigned to my fate."
Eight minutes later Mr. Tibwa responded. "We are coming to pick you," he wrote. "I promise."
Mr. al-Gada was less sure. It was nearly dark, and a fragile cease-fire was about to end. A tense argument ended with a decision to go, reluctantly. "We were not so happy with each other," Mr. Tibwa said.
At the apartment they found more than they bargained for: about 15 people, including a Korean couple with two children. They were being evicted, a U.N. official said, because the R.S.F. commander's second wife lived next door.
A three-vehicle convoy pulled out, windows down to show they were transporting women and children. Fighting resumed in the city, with airstrikes and shooting.
In the second car, Danielle Boyles, 27, a preschool teacher from South Africa, cowered under an abaya. At one checkpoint, a fighter threatened to shoot the Malawian U.N. official beside her. She started to tremble and pray.
"The R.S.F. guy cocked his gun," she said. "When I heard that sound, I thought he was dead."
Reaching the Al Salam hotel, they piled out, exhausted.
A Five-Star Refugee Camp
The Al Salam was known as the capital's political salon, a place where the rich, powerful and heavily armed wrangled over the future of Sudan. Luxury four-wheel drives with dark windows pulled up before its revolving doors. Militia leaders rubbed shoulders with Western diplomats over its $ 50 buffet. Negotiators from the African Union sipped coffee in the lounge. Mercenaries from Russia's Wagner private military company exercised in the gym.
The war transformed the hotel. By Day 5, all 236 rooms and suites were occupied, the manager said, some sleeping six people to a room.
Stray bullets punctured the lobby window and guest rooms. Guests filmed gunfights from the upper floors. Food had to be rationed. When a pitched battle erupted on Africa Street, outside the main gate, guests crowded into the basement and the gym locker rooms.
Mr. Tibwa and Mr. al-Gada became fixtures in the lobby, flopping onto sofas after rescue runs. It was still Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, and they didn't eat or drink until sunset. Guests marveled that they kept making more rescues. "They didn't seem to eat much," said the wife of a senior U.N. official. "I think they were just going on adrenaline."
Some guests were local residents who had run directly to the Al Salam when the war erupted. They asked the two students to pass by their homes to collect passports, laptops or a pet dog and cat. The students entered the deserted home of the head of the U.N. refugee agency in Sudan, lighting their way with a candle and guided by a video call with a family member. They held their noses as they passed a fridge filled with rotting food.
Mr. Hadi, the Algerian factory manager, had been using the hotel pool on his day off when the fighting started. The students drove him home to get his passport. But when a soldier at a checkpoint found something he thought suspicious in Mr. al-Gada's phone, chaos erupted. Guns were drawn and Mr. al-Gada quickly found himself face down on the street, a cocked Kalashnikov at his head.
Mr. Hadi, watching from the back seat, braced for the worst. "I was waiting for his brains to come on my face," he said.
But Mr. al-Gada kept talking and, after a long 15 minutes, the fighter backed down. As the car rolled away, Mr. al-Gada was "sweating like hell," Mr. Hadi recalled. "He was terrified."
Camel Meat and Kalashnikovs
The R.S.F. fighters could be friendly or frightening, and the student rescuers experienced both these faces directly.
Formed in 2013 from the feared Janjaweed militias that once terrorized the western region of Darfur, the R.S.F. has in recent years sought to rehabilitate its image. But few Sudanese can forget the group's participation in a massacre of over 120 democracy protesters in 2019.
The R.S.F. has spread across Khartoum in recent weeks; Western officials estimate it controls 80 percent of the city. Some residents tell of being robbed or assaulted by R.S.F. fighters, while others say smiling fighters gave them money and assurances.
As Mr. Tibwa and Mr. al-Gada drove back to their apartment on the sixth night of fighting, they said, R.S.F. troops stole from their car a cellphone and $ 1,100 -- cash pressed on them by grateful passengers. When Mr. al-Gada reported the theft at the next checkpoint, an R.S.F. officer insisted on investigating it, even as fighting raged around them.
With R.S.F. soldiers at the wheel of their car, Mr. Tibwa and Mr. al-Gada were driven back to the post where they had been robbed, then to a makeshift R.S.F. base at the back of the city airport. Scared, Mr. Tibwa sent his location to Patience and another U.N. official he had saved.
The second U.N. official urged them to get out. "Please Hassan, I'm begging you!!!!" she texted.
It was too late. Moments later, a new officer appeared, a scowling man who began treating the students as suspects, interrogating them and placing them in handcuffs.
The episode ended hours later when, finally assuaged, the fighters freed the students, handed back $ 500 and insisted on escorting them home. On the way, the convoy stopped at a checkpoint where soldiers were eating a meal: a giant platter of camel meat and rice. They insisted the students join them.
The R.S.F. commander gave them a bag of leftovers to take home and, days later, sent Mr. Tibwa a memento: a photo of their shared meal at 3 a.m. on the deserted streets of a shellshocked city.

A Final Rescue
The students' final mission was their longest: a trip across the Nile to the city of Omdurman, at the request of Rwandan diplomats, to rescue a woman who, unlike the first they rescued, really was pregnant.
As their Toyota approached the house, the woman, who gave her name as Fifi, texted them. "Alhamdulilah," she wrote -- the Arabic for "praise be to God." She was eight months pregnant, and had been stranded with her young son for 10 days.
By then, an exodus of foreigners from Khartoum was underway.
A dramatic helicopter evacuation the previous night of the American Embassy, led by SEAL team 6 commandos, set off a cascade of evacuations. British, French and Turkish military aircraft landed at an airstrip north of Khartoum, leaving with diplomats and private citizens.
Most of the people the students had deposited at the Al Salam finally left on a United Nations convoy of buses, cars and four-wheel drives that made a grueling 35-hour journey to Port Sudan, 525 miles away. From there, many took ships across the Red Sea to Saudi Arabia.
The United Nations rejected criticisms, voiced privately by numerous staff members, that it had failed to protect endangered employees or to prepare for the war despite ample warning signs.
The organization's Department for Safety and Security "is not a protective service," a U.N. spokesman, Farhan Haq, said in an email. "It has neither the mandate nor the capabilities to perform systematic extractions or 'rescues."'
Asked if the United Nations intended to investigate any shortcomings, Mr. Haq wrote, "In any crisis situation, we always look for lessons learned."
As the foreigners left, most of Khartoum's 5 million residents remained, sheltering in their homes and praying for a real cease-fire. The students stayed behind too, at first.
"Khartoum is getting empty now," Mr. Tibwa said from their apartment last week, the sound of gunfire rattling in the background.
But a day later they were gone. A friendly R.S.F. commander had warned them that "something big was coming" in the city center, Mr. Tibwa said. He advised them to get out while they could. They packed up the Toyota and drove 14 miles to the edge of the capital, where Mr. al-Gada's family has a house.
For a few days they considered their options, working out, drinking coffee and reading novels (Mr. Tibwa started Paulo Coelho's "The Alchemist"). Fighter jets scudded over the horizon and a stray bomb landed nearby, killing members of a family in their home, they said.
Mr. Tibwa wanted to stay in Sudan, a country he said he had grown to love -- and where he was a single semester away from completing his engineering degree. But his time had run out.
On Wednesday, Mr. al-Gada dropped his friend on a street where he hoped to catch a bus to Ethiopia, and from there back to Tanzania.
A personal reckoning loomed, Mr. Tibwa noted ruefully: Now his parents would learn that he had been studying in Sudan, and not Algeria, all along.
As they separated, Mr. Tibwa pulled out his cellphone and began filming.
"Saying goodbye to my boy, Sami," he said as the Toyota rolled down the street, his partner waving through the window. "See you man. See you."

In the first days of Sudan’s war, the two university students felt helpless.
They locked themselves in their apartment in the capital, Khartoum, glued to Twitter as the battle unfolded. They winced as the walls shuddered from blasts and gunfire, taking shelter in the corridor. They wondered where Sudan was going.
On the fifth day, April 19, the phone rang: Someone needed a taxi.
A senior United Nations official, a woman in her 40s, was trapped inside her home in an upscale neighborhood, the caller explained. Her situation was desperate. Pickup trucks mounted with machine guns stood outside her building, firing at warplanes that zoomed overhead. Black smoke was streaming into her apartment after an airstrike nearby. She had run out of water. Her cellphone battery was down to 5%. Could they rescue her?
The students, Hassan Tibwa and Sami al-Gada, in their final year of mechanical engineering, had a side gig driving a taxi. But this call wasn’t a paying job; it was a mercy run. Tibwa phoned the woman. “She was screaming,” he recalled. “We had only a few minutes before her phone died. She was on her own.”
They jumped into al-Gada’s car, a dinged, seven-year-old Toyota sedan, and set off into the city, horrified at its transformation. Bullet holes pocked buildings. Charred vehicles littered the streets. Fighters were everywhere.
Crunching over bullet casings, they navigated a gantlet of checkpoints manned by jittery fighters from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, some wearing bandages or limping. The fighters scanned the students’ phones and peppered them with questions. It took an hour to travel 4 miles.
“We went through hell,” Tibwa said.
They found the U.N. official, named Patience, alone at her apartment in an apparently deserted building. She had been hiding in her bathroom for days, slowly depleting three cellphones, she said, showing them a scatter of bullet holes in her living room wall.
The students consoled her, wrapped her in an all-covering abaya robe and devised a cover story: Their passenger was pregnant and needed to get to a hospital. They paused to say a prayer. “We knew that the moment we stepped out, there was no going back,” Tibwa said.
Forty-five minutes and 10 checkpoints later, their Toyota pulled up outside the Al Salam, one of Khartoum’s most expensive hotels, now a five-star refugee camp. Patience wept with relief. After collecting herself and checking in, she sat the students down to ask an urgent question.
Could they go back and rescue her friends too?
Over the next week, Tibwa, 25, and al-Gada, 23, rescued dozens of desperate people from one of Khartoum's fiercest battle zones, according to interviews with the students, those they extracted and hundreds of text messages. Along the way, they were robbed, handcuffed and threatened with execution. Fighters accused them of being spies. Diplomats implored them to retrieve their passports and pets. Shellfire and stray bullets fell around their car.
“The bravery of these guys is just amazing,” said Fares Hadi, an Algerian factory manager who survived a hair-raising ride with them through Khartoum. “So impressive, so courageous.”
Every rescuee interviewed said the students had not asked for payment.
Over six days, as the war surged between two feuding military factions — the army and the Rapid Support Forces group — the students helped at least 60 people: South African teachers, Rwandan diplomats, Russian aid workers and U.N. workers from many countries, including Kenya, Zimbabwe, Sweden and the United States.
“The only word for them is heroes,” a U.N. official said.
From Students to Rescuers
Even as Tibwa drove strangers to safety, his own family didn’t know he was in Sudan.
He arrived in 2017 from Tanzania, where his family runs a modest hardware store at a small town on Lake Victoria. An Islamic charity provided a scholarship to study engineering at the International University of Africa in Khartoum.
But he told his parents that he was going to study in Algeria, in deference to their concerns about Sudan’s history of violent unrest — a lie he easily maintained for six years, because he never had enough money to go home.
Al-Gada is Sudanese but was raised in a sleepy town in northeastern Saudi Arabia, where his father was a car mechanic.
Classmates in university, the two young men soon became friends. They shared a bright, open disposition and a gritty entrepreneurial streak, working odd jobs at night to make rent. Tibwa drove a taxi that catered mostly to African U.N. officials.
Sudan’s turbulent politics disrupted their ambition. Classes were canceled for much of 2019 when roaring protesters, including al-Gada, helped topple President Omar al-Bashir, Sudan’s dictator of 30 years.
Then, in October 2021, Sudan’s two most powerful military leaders — Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan of the army and Lt. Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the RSF — joined forces to boot out the civilian prime minister and seize power for themselves in a coup. Protests flared. The economy tanked.
The two students thought little, at first, of the shots that rang out across Khartoum early on April 15: Anti-military demonstrators had been clashing with riot police for more than a year.
But when al-Gada went to campus to submit a paper, the guards sent him home. This time, it was not a protest, they said. It was war.
Tibwa and al-Gada were not the only rescuers. Local Resistance Committees, formed years earlier to push Sudan toward democracy, pivoted to helping Sudanese and foreigners flee.
But for some stricken residents, the two students were the only option.
“They called us,” Tibwa said. “They didn’t have food. They had no power. Their phones were going down. We tried to imagine ourselves in that same situation. So we went out.”
A Final Rescue
The students’ final mission was their longest: a trip across the Nile to the city of Omdurman, at the request of Rwandan diplomats, to rescue a woman who, unlike the first they rescued, really was pregnant.
As their Toyota approached the house, the woman, who gave her name as Fifi, texted them. She wrote, “Alhamdulilah” — Arabic for “Praise be to God.” She was eight months pregnant and had been stranded with her young son for 10 days.
By then, an exodus of foreigners from Khartoum was underway.
A dramatic helicopter evacuation the previous night of the U.S. Embassy, led by the Navy’s SEAL Team 6 commandos, set off a cascade of evacuations.
Most of the people the students had deposited at the Al Salam finally left on a U.N. convoy of buses, cars and four-wheel drives that made a grueling 35-hour journey to Port Sudan. From there, many took ships across the Red Sea to Saudi Arabia.
As the foreigners left, most of Khartoum’s 5 million residents remained. The students stayed behind too, at first.
“Khartoum is getting empty now,” Tibwa said from their apartment last week, the sound of gunfire rattling in the background.
But a day later, they were gone. A friendly RSF commander had warned them that “something big was coming” in the city center, Tibwa said. He advised them to get out while they could. They packed up the Toyota and drove 14 miles to the edge of the capital, where al-Gada’s family has a house.
For a few days, they considered their options, working out, drinking coffee and reading novels. Fighter jets scudded over the horizon, and a stray bomb landed nearby, killing members of a family in their home, they said.
Tibwa wanted to stay in Sudan, a country he said he had grown to love — and where he was a single semester away from completing his engineering degree. But his time had run out.
On Wednesday, al-Gada dropped his friend on a street where he hoped to catch a bus to Ethiopia and, from there, back to Tanzania.
A personal reckoning loomed, Tibwa noted ruefully: Now his parents would learn that he had been studying in Sudan, not Algeria, all along.
As they separated, Tibwa pulled out his cellphone and began filming.
“Saying goodbye to my boy, Sami,” he said as the Toyota rolled down the street, his partner waving through the window. “See you, man. See you.”

Navigating a Real-Life Plot Twist: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: When the sudden death of Mike Hagerty, one of the show's stars, forced the creators to retool the new season, they sprinkled tributes to him throughout the episodes.
In the first episode of the new season of "Somebody Somewhere," the poignant Kansas-set comedy that returned to HBO this week, Sam (Bridget Everett) receives a letter from her father, Ed. The letter informs her that he has gone to join his brother in Corpus Christi, Texas. Ed, a farmer, has charged Sam with feeding the chickens, mowing the lawn and cleaning out the barn. Sam begins her chores, but when she finds Ed's baseball cap, she begins to tear up.
"It just feels really weird to be here with all his stuff," Sam says. "I know he couldn't have cleaned out this barn -- it would have broken his heart. I didn't know it would break mine."
Heartbreak might seem like a strong reaction to some rusted farm equipment. But Mike Hagerty, the actor who played Ed, had died unexpectedly in May 2022, at the age of 67, about a month before filming began for the Season 2. Ed lives on, sailing across the Gulf of Mexico; his absence and Hagerty's absence inform most of the season. In its quiet, fine-grained way, these episodes of "Somebody Somewhere" provide a eulogy in comedy form, with grief triangulated and transformed.
"We knew we wanted to dedicate the season to him," Hannah Bos, a "Somebody Somewhere" creator, said in a recent video call. "We wanted to celebrate him."
Hagerty, a Chicago native and an alum of the Second City comedy troupe, best known for a five-episode run as the building superintendent on "Friends," joined the series for the pilot in 2019. Carolyn Strauss, an executive producer, had worked with him before, on the short-lived series "Lucky Louie." She bet that Hagerty -- bushy haired, jowly, with a heart as big as a prairie -- would bring warmth and solidity to the taciturn Ed. She won that bet.
When Everett, a Kansas-born actress and cabaret star, met him for a chemistry read, she started crying before he had even said a word. "I felt immediately really safe," she said on that same video call. Strauss and Paul Thureen, the show's other creator, were also on the line.
"It just felt like the right match and the right person and also like I'd met a friend," Everett said. "I'm not trying to be corny; it's just really how I felt."
Bos and Thureen enjoyed writing for Hagerty, knowing that he could make any line sound grounded and sincere, that he could endow even simple dialogue with depth. And Everett felt that she grew as an actor every time she was opposite him. He felt to her, she said, like a surrogate father.
"Often I get really nervous on sets," she said. "His affable, calm, steady hand, it set me at ease."
Hagerty seemed to enjoy himself, too. In February 2022, in Los Angeles, HBO hosted a special screening for the Season 1 finale. Strauss chatted with him there, and she recalled him cracking that the show had taught him two words he'd never heard before in his long career: "Season 2." To celebrate, he bought himself a Toyota RAV4.
That spring, ‌Hagerty entered Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, feeling unwell. The Season 2 scripts had already been written, and he planned to participate in a table read from his hospital bed. But he was ultimately too ill to join. On May 5, following an adverse reaction to an antibiotic, he died.
The initial response from the producers and his co-stars was a mix of shock and grief. There was a group Zoom call, with cast and creators crying in their separate windows, sharing memories of Hagerty.
"He really did feel like a North Star in terms of what we were creating and what we had done," Strauss said. "So it was hard to believe; it felt very unreal."
Twining with the grief was an understandable amount of panic. The shoot was set to begin in two weeks, and Hagerty was meant to be in almost every episode. Amy Gravitt, HBO's executive vice president of comedy, made many individual calls, telling the showrunners and producers to take all the time that they needed to mourn -- to put off worrying about the show. But Bos and Thureen knew that to put it off for too long would risk losing actors and crew members. A frantic rewrite began.
At first, no one knew what to do about Ed, but Strauss, Bos and Thureen felt that they shouldn't have him die. Season 1 had begun shortly after the death of Sam's sister Holly -- as the show follows Sam's halting steps toward self-acceptance and a full adult life, the thinking went, another death and an explicit focus on grief would set her back too far.
Everett wasn't so sure. Her own sister and father had died a year apart, and she figured the show, which operates with an unusual degree of realism, might as well mirror that. But after sleeping on it, she agreed.
Production was pushed back two weeks. Strauss worried that wouldn't be enough time for a full rewrite, but she didn't share that worry with the others. As originally written, the season had focused partly on Ed growing too old for hands-on farming and on his relationship with his wife, an alcoholic. He also played a role in a season-ending wedding. All of that had to be retooled. So Bos, Thureen and Everett got to work on Zoom. Thureen said these sessions, however fraught, brought relief.
"It helped in a weird way to have something to focus on," he said. "It turned into a creative problem-solving thing."
With Strauss's help, they all worked to find a metaphor that would account for Hagerty's absence and honor his life. Together they came up with the idea of the brother's boat and sending Ed across the water, finally free. They also made him a presence throughout several episodes, via occasional letters and phone calls.
When it came time to do the scene in the barn, Everett was anxious about how it would feel to act without Hagerty. "That was going to be an emotional house of cards for me," she said. "We all kind of felt it. Just being there without him was devastating." She had learned the monologue about cleaning out the barn by heart, but when it came time to speak it, the loss of Hagerty overtook her. The tears she cries in the scene are very real.
"We only did it two times or three times because it was just a little much," she said. "I just wanted to say it and then let it go."
Later in the season, there is a funeral for a different character. This became an oblique tribute to Hagerty, with his memory shadowing several of the eulogies. "A poetic honoring," Thureen called it. And in the final episode, a wedding reception pauses to honor Ed.
"Raise your glasses everybody, raise them high -- this is to Ed," a character says. It was a way of making sure that Ed was still there, still a part of this family and this community.
If "Somebody Somewhere" is renewed for further seasons, Ed, however far away, will remain a part of them. The creative team is already kicking around Ed-centered ideas for Season 3. Hagerty, in his own way, remains with the show, too.
"His impact endures," Strauss said. "He's left everybody with a gift: that gravity and humor and forthrightness that characterize him, we all carry it."

Terrified of the New Neighbors Roaming Sudan's Capital: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: In parts of Khartoum that have been taken over by a feared paramilitary force, the civilians who have not fled endure an uneasy coexistence with fighters who are battling the regular army.
In the 12 days since war broke out in Sudan, the residents in the capital of Khartoum have learned to survive, living side by side with armed fighters.
Civilians negotiate with a feared paramilitary faction at roadblocks for safe passage, grudgingly share food and water with them, and sometimes receive warnings about an upcoming battle -- giving residents time to either bolt or run back inside and lock their doors.
The fighters have moved into homes and taken over stores and hospitals, alternatively terrifying and wooing civilians. In one neighborhood, a resident said, they handed out milk. In another, they invited community members to share in the spoils of their looting. In another, they turned vigilantes, punishing petty criminals.
Many residents try to avoid the faction as much as possible.
"Apparently they don't have anyone that gives them orders so they're just doing their thing," said Dania Atabani, who lives in Khartoum. "Very dangerous and chaotic."
The paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, was part of a military-led government as recently as this month, but is now combating the regular army for power in Sudan, a northeast African country of 45 million people surrounded by seven nations.
A tenuous three-day cease-fire that partly tamped down the fighting in parts of Khartoum was extended by both sides for another 72 hours on Thursday night, after intense pressure by neighboring countries, the United States, the U.K. and the United Nations.
On Thursday afternoon, the White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had urged American citizens to leave within the next 48 hours "because the situation could deteriorate at any moment." There are believed to be about 16,000 Americans in Sudan, many of them dual nationals.
Speaking by phone and text message, residents from across the capital said that R.S.F. troops appeared to control much of the city center and surrounding districts, along with parts of Khartoum's twin city, Omdurman, penetrating deep into residential areas. The regular military is positioned farther out, where it controls entry and exit, and can still use its warplanes to carry out strikes on R.S.F. targets.
"The R.S.F. remains hyper-focused on winning Khartoum," said Alan Boswell, the Horn of Africa project director at the International Crisis Group. "This is the ultimate showdown."
In the first few days of the conflict, the R.S.F. engaged in fierce fighting in Khartoum neighborhoods like Al Amarat and Khartoum 2, close to the city's international airport, occupying streets where there are many embassies and wealthy residents. They also set up checkpoints in upscale neighborhoods like al-Riyadh, where they placed antiaircraft guns in front of homes to target the circling army planes.
The R.S.F. fighters are usually in groups of five to 20 at checkpoints, residents said, though in the Kafouri neighborhood north of the capital, more than 50 gathered at one point. They usually carry bazookas, Kalashnikov rifles and machine guns, and arrive in Toyota pickup trucks. Some residents said they sometimes even had antiaircraft guns.
"Since the first day, they are spreading through the neighborhoods and they are taking the people as shields," said Gasim Amin Oshi, an engineer turned activist and community organizer.
The R.S.F. quickly moved into Mr. Oshi's Baitalmaal neighborhood in Omdurman, set up checkpoints on the bridge, then headed straight for the police headquarters, taking it after a short gun battle. Next, they went for the national radio and television station, then the hospital, a technical school, and several buildings. They ransacked the supermarket and looted bakeries. As people evacuated, the fighters began to occupy homes in the neighborhood.
"I can't move freely, I can't get my stuff freely. We have a small window to move around in," Mr. Oshi said. In the afternoons, when fighting slows, he risks going out in search of food and medical supplies, but tries not to attract attention since community members said they had been robbed by some fighters.
Mr. Oshi belongs to one of the "resistance committees" that make up a grass-roots, pro-democracy movement that protested military rule before the current fighting. They have become a lifeline for some residents in Khartoum, distributing food, medicine and cellphone credit. To do this, they have had to learn to play both sides, especially the R.S.F.
When a source within the R.S.F. warns of a strike to come, or someone within the military or secret services cautions that escalated fighting can be expected, the committee issues a social media alert, Mr. Oshi said.
In a largely residential neighborhood in Khartoum, R.S.F. fighters moved into four apartment buildings in one area, turning the streets into a war zone, said a member of the area's resistance committee, who asked not to be named out of concern for her safety.
She said the committee has had to negotiate with R.S.F. fighters to allow some families to leave, begging their way through checkpoints, where fighters have not asked for money but have asked for water or food. Most residents oblige, trying to survive, the member said.
Others simply hide, living in fear of a force with a terrifying past.
The R.S.F. originated from the notorious Janjaweed militias, which in the early 2000s helped the former dictator Omar Hassan al-Bashir brutally quash a rebellion in the western region of Darfur. Analysts and Western officials estimate that the unit has 70,000 to 100,000 fighters, and that they are better trained and equipped than the army.
The R.S.F. leader, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, was a commander with the Janjaweed who rose through the ranks to become one of the closest backers of Mr. al-Bashir, before turning on him. After Mr. al-Bashir was deposed in 2019, General Hamdan grew in power and stature, becoming the second-ranking figure behind the army commander, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, now his enemy.
Jihad Mashamoun, a Sudanese researcher and political analyst, said that in the capital, the R.S.F. had been using "hit-and-run tactics to attack and capture the positions held by the Sudanese armed forces."
The army, he said, has responded by using its key advantages, which include helicopters, tanks and heavy machinery, to recapture some of those positions.
In some neighborhoods south of Khartoum, the army has the upper hand. The suburb of Abu Adam is close to a military base. Musab Abdullah, 24, a resident there, said he usually saw soldiers in uniform or driving armored vehicles. When he ventures beyond his neighborhood though, R.S.F. checkpoints await.
They are usually searching for weapons or interrogating people to find out if they are linked to the military, Mr. Abdullah said. Despite the relative safety of living close to an army barracks, the paramilitary's reputation terrifies him.
"At any time they could break into my house, kill me or use me as a human shield for them," he said via text message.
Members of Khartoum's medical community have felt particularly vulnerable. Rumors abound that the R.S.F. is abducting doctors and nurses, forcing them at gunpoint to treat their wounded fighters. So some doctors have treated people in their homes, but the fear of the R.S.F. has driven many of them out of Khartoum.
"As a doctor, it's heartbreaking feeling useless," said Walaa Mirghani F. Almoula, a doctor who lives in central Khartoum. "We can't help people."
After a week of hiding in her home, Dr. Almoula said, she fled with her brother, who is also a doctor. They hid their professional identities through each of the four nerve-racking R.S.F. checkpoints they had to get through on the journey to Wad Madani, a refuge city southeast of Khartoum.
Even as its fighters mount attacks against the army in the capital, the paramilitary unit has become synonymous with one activity: looting. In interviews, residents in the capital said they saw R.S.F. soldiers break into markets, hospitals, university campuses, electronic shops, and in one case, even invite members of the neighborhood to help themselves to a grocery store. The few bystanders declined to follow them into the store, said one resident.
The Sudan Animal Rescue, a nonprofit group that provides sanctuary for dozens of animals including lions, said last week that a member of the paramilitary force had stolen one of its vehicles.
"It was shocking," said Mutaz Kamal, a volunteer with the center who said he had reviewed footage of the attack. "He broke the windows and just drove away. Just like that."

Full text: When rising floodwater surrounded her home the morning of July 29, Carolyn Combs felt a sense of déjà vu. The year before, floodwater had filled the first floor of her family's home in Jackson, Ky., damaging living spaces, storage and her two teenage children's bedrooms.
Ms. Combs, her husband and their children spent months living on the second floor while the lower level was gut-renovated, a project that was nearly complete when the 2022 storms began. Before evacuating this time, they moved as many belongings as possible upstairs in hopes of avoiding the previous year's losses.
But this time, nearly 10 feet of water accumulated, reaching the second story.
"Everything inside was completely, completely gone," Ms. Combs, 37, said. "We had to get rid of everything." She estimated that her family had spent between $ 6,000 and $ 7,000 replacing items like furniture and appliances after the first flood. Now, they had to start over.
When they evacuated, Ms. Combs and her daughter had each carried a backpack filled with clothes and small belongings like phone chargers. Hours later, realizing the damage that was likely, her children returned in a neighbor's kayak to grab critical medical care items for Mr. Combs, who is disabled.
The costs quickly added up. Three nights in a hotel room were nearly $ 500. With no place to cook, the family bought all meals, about $ 80 per day. Ms. Combs remembered being shocked to discover that they had spent $ 75 on laundry alone in the early days after the flood.
The Combses needed hygiene supplies, like toothbrushes and feminine care products. They bought food, crates and litter boxes for their pets.
After major disasters like the Kentucky floods, broad analyses of costs factor in losses reported to insurance companies or government agencies. But smaller expenses are often overlooked and rarely reimbursed, even though they can take a significant toll on an individual or family bank account.
"It's just the simple things," Ms. Combs said. "Groceries, everyday needs, plus taking care of my kids, all while working two jobs. It's hard on us trying to rebuild."
The day-to-day costs of rebuilding
The flooding in eastern Kentucky was severe enough that President Biden approved a major disaster declaration for 13 counties. This allowed residents to receive aid from government agencies including the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration.
The Combses knew their house was in a flood zone: In 2009, the house was damaged by about three feet of floodwater before Ms. Combs and her daughter moved in. At that time, the household was approved for FEMA assistance, which included a year of paid flood insurance.
The Combses then took over those payments for a few years until the expense -- more than $ 500 a month, Ms. Combs said -- became unaffordable. So when faced with flood damage again, they understood they would not receive assistance from the agency or insurance. Ms. Combs did apply for a loan from the Small Business Administration but was denied because of her credit score, she said. Without government aid, the family has relied on organizations like the American Red Cross and community support to make ends meet. A church group helped clean out the house, including throwing out the refrigerator, stocked with spoiled food. Aspire Appalachia, an eastern Kentucky nonprofit, installed new drywall and bought some of the major fixtures the Combses needed to replace, including a toilet, a washing machine and a dryer.
Family and friends have also pitched in, covering the price of the hotel stay, buying items from an Amazon wish list and paying for the teenagers' back-to-school needs. Critically, the Combses have been able to stay at a relative's property for free while their house is repaired.
They have been blessed, as Ms. Combs sees it. And yet, on a Friday evening in March, nearly eight months after the flood, she found herself feeling overwhelmed as she reviewed receipts. The family is still paying for water and electrical services despite not living in the damaged home. The downstairs ceiling is unfinished, and they still need a new heating system.
Ms. Combs estimated that they had spent a few thousand dollars to get back home. Adding the past flooding expenses brings the total above $ 10,000.
She hopes to move back into the house before her birthday on April 30, and expects to spend more on replacing missing household items. Priceless keepsakes from Ms. Combs's mother, who died after contracting Covid-19 the same month as the 2021 flood, remain lost.
"I had several things that were hers that are gone," Ms. Combs said. "Things like that are the hardest things to think about."
Beyond FEMA assistance
According to a report from the Ohio River Valley Institute and the Appalachian Citizens' Law Center, six in 10 households damaged in the 2022 floods reported incomes under $ 30,000, and most did not have flood insurance. For some, like the Combses, the policy cost was prohibitive; residents in the area say they've been quoted more than $ 1,000 per month.
Others were not considered to be living in a flood zone until after the storm. That was the case for Polly Barse Fleming, who said her house in Neon, Ky., had been in her husband's family for more than a century and never experienced flooding before last July.
Four days before the heavy rains, Ms. Barse Fleming, 42, bought a new car for the first time. The $ 20,000 down payment for the Toyota Highlander, a practical choice to navigate the rural roads to the middle school where she teaches science, was a significant and carefully considered expense. Then virtually overnight, her family needed to take out loans for tens of thousands of dollars to address disaster costs.
The house now relies on jacks to stay upright. Ms. Barse Fleming applied for FEMA funding, and after an in-person assessment of the damage, the agency sent $ 40,000. FEMA bases these figures on reported losses and needs, explaining that its support will not make a survivor "whole" but is meant to assist with basic living expenses.
Ms. Barse Fleming's family put the funds toward a down payment on a double-wide manufactured house. This choice was strategic: She said her insurance agent had explained that the double-wide's policy would cover flooding, saving the family an extra monthly cost. This was a selling point because even with FEMA funding and preapproval for a Small Business Administration loan, the personal expenses have been mounting.
In addition to jacks for the house, the family needed cleaning supplies and extra gas money for the longer route that Ms. Barse Fleming takes to work to avoid damaged roads. She also lost her garden, which used to provide the family with tomatoes, squash, peppers and other produce -- food she also gave to her pet tortoises and lizards.
Like Ms. Combs, Ms. Barse Fleming credits others for providing critical assistance in covering these costs. One donation that stood out was an upright bass from WoodSongs Old-Time Radio Hour, a nonprofit, for her 13-year-old daughter, a musician.
"Many of us have pieced our lives back together from the generosity of others," Ms. Barse Fleming said. "There is no way our family could have afforded new contents of the house in addition to all else we were trying to do."
Floods washing wealth away
According to Wallace Caleb Bates, community outreach coordinator with Aspire Appalachia, the organization that helped the Combs family, reckoning with day-to-day expenses after a disaster is a common experience. He told of a flood survivor who realized she didn't have any cookware -- of how the items you take for granted can feel particularly daunting to replace.
Scott McReynolds, executive director of Housing Development Alliance, another local nonprofit, said it wasn't just household items that were lost -- many residents lost cars, equipment, toys or furniture left out in their yards. His house was left untouched, Mr. McReynolds said, but he needed to pay about $ 2,500 to repair his driveway.
Even families whose properties avoided damage faced extra costs after the storm. Much of the region remained without water and power off for weeks. Months later, residents are still paying inflated prices for high-demand goods like housing materials and may need to drive farther to make purchases while local stores rebuild.
"I wonder how much wealth in the area -- and we're a pretty low-wealth area in the first place -- literally washed down the creek," Mr. McReynolds said.
Ms. Combs said some people had told her that they would leave if they were in her position, but she has not given too much thought to that idea. Family and friends are here, in addition to her two jobs and her children's school.
And then there are the financial considerations. Despite living in a flood zone, the Combses own their land, which was passed down through Mr. Combs's family. If they moved, they would have to pay for land, rent or a mortgage, and would still be shouldering the costs for new furniture, clothing and the other household supplies they are working to replace.
"You just want to go home, you know?" Ms. Combs said. "Everybody wants to go home. But I don't know that I could do it a third time."

U.S. Says Head of ISIS Cell That Bombed Kabul Airport Is Dead: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Thirteen U.S. service members and scores of Afghan civilians died in the bombing as the United States was evacuating in August 2021.
WASHINGTON -- The Taliban have killed the leader of the Islamic State cell responsible for the suicide bombing at the international airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, in August 2021 that killed 13 U.S. troops and as many as 170 civilians, the White House said on Tuesday.
Four senior American officials said that U.S. intelligence analysts became aware in early April that the mastermind of the attack, whom they declined to identify, had died in a Taliban operation in Afghanistan. It was unclear whether the Taliban were specifically targeting the insurgent or he was killed in one of the increasing number of attacks between Taliban and Islamic State fighters, the officials said.
John F. Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, called the Taliban operation "another in a series of high-profile leadership losses" that the Islamic State cell, known as Islamic State Khorasan Province, or ISIS-K, had suffered this year.
The officials said that based on classified intelligence reports -- most likely from informants, electronic intercepts or information from allied spy services -- analysts concluded with "high confidence" that the chief plotter of the airport attack had been killed. But the officials offered no evidence to support that conclusion or other details about his purported death.
The administration on Monday began calling relatives of the American troops who died in the attack to tell them that the ISIS-K leader had been killed by Taliban security forces in recent weeks. Officials were also sparing with the details they were willing to share with the families.
"They couldn't give me his name; they couldn't tell me the details of the operation," said Darin Hoover, the father of Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover of the Marine Corps, who was killed during the blast.
Mr. Hoover said that while he had not expected the military to share everything it knew, the call left him feeling "frustrated, again."
"I want the administration to take some accountability and responsibility for this," Mr. Hoover said. "Say, 'We screwed up. It's not going to happen again.' It can't happen again. He gave his life for this. This is what he wanted to do, and this is what happened -- and now we're all being treated like garbage."
The 2021 evacuation from Afghanistan and its aftermath continue to be a subject of heated debate on Capitol Hill, where Republicans have voiced similar demands of the Biden administration.
G.O.P. lawmakers have accused the administration of being directly responsible for the failures of the exit and condemned administration officials as inept when it comes to the future of counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan. Democrats have largely defended those officials, arguing they did the best they could in a difficult situation and faulting President Biden's predecessor, Donald J. Trump, for making a deal with the Taliban that committed the United States to exit.
Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, who is running one of the congressional investigations into the Afghanistan evacuation, hailed the reported killing of the terrorist leader responsible for the Abbey Gate attack. He said in a statement that "any time a terrorist is taken off the board is a good day."
"But this doesn't diminish the Biden administration's culpability for the failures that led to the attack at Abbey Gate, and will in no way deter the committee's investigation," Mr. McCaul added.
There is very limited, if any, information sharing about the Islamic State between the Taliban and the United States, and the U.S. officials said the United States had no involvement in the attack that killed the cell leader.
ISIS-K and the Taliban have been fighting pitched battles since the United States withdrew from Afghanistan in August 2021.
The attack raised ISIS-K's international profile, positioning it as a major threat to the Taliban's ability to govern the country and, according to American officials, as the most imminent terrorist risk to the United States coming out of Afghanistan.
President Biden and his top commanders have said the United States would carry out "over-the-horizon" strikes from a base in the United Arab Emirates against ISIS and Qaeda insurgents who threaten the United States.
Over the past two years, the Taliban have waged a heavy-handed campaign against ISIS-K in Afghanistan. So far, their security services have effectively prevented the group from seizing territory or recruiting large numbers of former Taliban fighters bored in peacetime -- among the worst case scenarios laid out after Afghanistan's Western-backed government collapsed.
Still, in the absence of American airstrikes and Afghan commando raids that killed many of its leaders, ISIS-K has spread from its original stronghold in eastern Afghanistan to nearly all of the country's 34 provinces, according to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. The group has also carried out major suicide attacks on government buildings and foreign embassies in Kabul.
The attacks have undercut the peaceful image the Taliban have sought to paint of Afghanistan under their rule, the first stretch of relative calm the country has seen in 40 years and a hallmark promise of the Taliban's new government. Even as some officials with the Taliban administration promote the successes of raids on purported ISIS-K hide-outs, others have outright denied the existence of ISIS-K in the country.
In February 2022, a Pentagon report concluded that a single Islamic State suicide bomber carried out the attack at the Abbey Gate of the airport. The findings by a team of Army-led investigators contradicted initial reports by senior U.S. commanders that militants fired into the crowd of people at the airport seeking to flee the country and caused some of the casualties.
The report also absolved Marines of firing lethal shots into the crowd at Abbey Gate as some officials had suspected because of the large amount of ammunition the Marines had fired after the attack, which took place on Aug. 26.
The Islamic State identified the suicide bomber as Abdul Rahman Al-Logari. American officials say he was a former engineering student who was one of several thousand militants freed from at least two high-security prisons after the Taliban seized control of Kabul 11 days before the attack. The Taliban emptied the facilities indiscriminately, releasing not only their own imprisoned members but also fighters from ISIS-K.
Perhaps the biggest error by the United States after the Abbey Gate bombing would come just three days later. On Aug. 29, American officials, fearful that another suicide bomber would attack the airport, launched a drone strike, hitting a white Toyota loaded with what were likely water canisters, not explosives. The officials who called in the strike had not noticed video footage that showed the presence of at least one child in the area two minutes before the strike.
In the end, 10 civilians, including seven children, were killed.

Full text: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the assistance was needed to offset incentives offered by the United States.
Volkswagen's first North American battery plant for electric vehicles will be built in Canada, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other Canadian politicians made it clear on Friday that the country had effectively been in a bidding war with the United States.
"We put up a lot of money," Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference in St. Thomas, Ontario, where six assembly lines covering 370 acres will be built. "Everyone wanted this."
Volkswagen announced last month that it would put its first battery plant outside Europe in Canada, but provided few details. On Friday, Canada and the province of Ontario said they would give the company a combined 1 billion Canadian dollars -- about $ 750 million in U.S. currency -- to construct the factory, which will cost 7 billion Canadian dollars overall.
A separate agreement will provide 8 billion to 10 billion Canadian dollars in subsidies over the next decade to match benefits that Volkswagen would have received under the Inflation Reduction Act if it had put the factory in the United States. That amount is tied to battery production.
Mr. Trudeau, speaking at a railway museum in front of a steam locomotive and two electric Volkswagen models, said that while it was impossible for Canada to broadly match U.S. industrial subsidies, the deal with Volkswagen had come out of a policy decision by Canada to strategically challenge its neighbor.
Volkswagen considered about a dozen other places in North America for the plant, which it said would eventually employ 3,000 people and make enough batteries annually for one million vehicles.
"Congratulations from our side for outperforming the competition and bringing this gigafactory to St. Thomas," said Frank Blome, the chief executive of PowerCo, Volkswagen's battery subsidiary. "That wasn't easy."
The Volkswagen plant will be the second major battery operation in Ontario. Last year, the automaker Stellantis and the South Korean company LG Energy Solution announced a factory in Windsor, where Stellantis has a large assembly plant that Chrysler built. That factory, which will employ 2,500 people and start production next year, also received substantial government subsidies toward its cost of 5 billion Canadian dollars.
Volkswagen will become the sixth automaker with large operations in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, and the first to establish operations there since Honda and Toyota arrived in the 1980s. St. Thomas was once home to a heavy-truck plant owned by Daimler of Germany as well as a Ford Motor factory that, in its final years, assembled cars primarily used as police cruisers and taxis. Both were closed by 2011 and not replaced by other industries.
After the initial announcement last month, Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party of Canada, criticized the government for subsidizing Volkswagen.
"This money belongs to Canadians," he wrote on Twitter. "Not to a foreign corporation. Not to Justin Trudeau."
But Andreas Schotter, an associate professor of international business at Western University in London, Ontario, and a former financial executive with Volkswagen North America, said subsidies were the reality for countries seeking to maintain their automotive industries.
"It's a good thing, but with a high risk," he said, noting that policy shifts, particularly in the United States, could slow the transition to electric vehicles or that other technologies, like hydrogen fuel cells, could dislodge batteries over time.
While St. Thomas, which is midway between Detroit and Toronto, is in the center of Canada's automotive corridor, it is a considerable distance from Volkswagen's North American factories in Tennessee and Mexico. It is, however, just down the road from a factory where General Motors recently began building electric delivery vans and a Toyota factory that makes hybrid crossovers.
Over time, Dr. Schotter said, the new factory may end up supplying batteries to other companies.

Car Show Flaunts China's Switch to Electric: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Shanghai auto show, the largest in China since before the pandemic, had one theme: The dominance of electric vehicles in the world's largest car market is here to stay.
A hall showing off electric vehicles made by Nio, XPeng Motors, Zeekr and dozens of other Chinese companies was mobbed with visitors. An area nearby full of gasoline-powered cars by foreign brands barely got a second look by anyone.
At the same event, Volkswagen, which vies with Toyota to be the world's biggest seller of cars with combustion engines, issued a bold forecast: Within two years, half the cars sold in China, the world's largest automobile market, will be electric, up from only 6 percent in 2020.
The theme at the Shanghai auto show this week was clear. Electric cars are here to stay, and Chinese automakers are leading the field.
Silvio Pietro Angori, the chief executive and managing director of Pininfarina of Italy, a nearly century-old car design business, said the global industry was not going back.
The internal combustion engine, he said, "is done, it's gone, it doesn't exist any more."
The Shanghai auto show is one of the world's biggest, and the first of its size in China since 2019. During the pandemic, when China's borders were sealed because of "zero Covid" precautions, its auto industry was quietly transformed and the market share of foreign companies shrank. Today half the cars sold in Shanghai itself are already electric.
Brian Gu, the president and vice chairman of Xpeng, said his company planned to reduce the cost of building a powertrain -- primarily the battery and electric motor -- by 25 percent by the end of the year. Powertrains, particularly the batteries, make up about two-fifths of Xpeng's overall cost of building an electric car.
Ashwani Gupta, the chief operating officer of Nissan, one-upped Xpeng, saying his company's latest designs would cut powertrain costs by 30 percent. Shohei Yamazaki, the chairman of Nissan's China investments subsidiary, said Nissan would rely heavily on Chinese suppliers.
"Price competition in China is very fierce right now," he said.
Chinese brands have adopted unusual electric car designs while foreign companies and their Chinese joint ventures have played it safe. The wheels are nearly at the corners of the Chinese brand cars, an architecture that also allows more room for batteries under the floor in the middle. Nio and Xpeng have chosen sleek designs, while Changan, based in western China, is making cars so rectangular that they look faintly Cubist.
"Some of that comes from the freedom from legacy," said Felix Kilbertus, the chief creative officer at Pininfarina.
Great Wall, a Chinese maker of sport utility vehicles, has a new electric car brand, Ora, that is targeted to women. It named car models for cats, partly to appeal to lovers of the Hello Kitty brand. It has an electric car that strongly resembles a Volkswagen Beetle.
The main market for electric cars so far is China -- E.V.s were a quarter of China's market last year, compared with less than 6 percent in the United States.
Most of the cars displayed at the auto show use lithium batteries, the current industry standard, though companies are developing vehicles that run fully or partly on batteries made of sodium.
At the moment, there is a glut of lithium batteries, but long term many in the industry believe sodium can become a viable alternative or supplement to lithium as a key ingredient in E.V. batteries. For one thing, the production of sodium batteries would be better for the climate.
Toyota's chief scientist, Gill Pratt, contended at a session of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January that overall greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced more by replacing 90 gasoline cars with hybrid cars than by using the same amount of scarce lithium to build one battery-electric car.
"If you think about the total amount of lithium that the world has, the key is let's use it where it does the most good," he said.
Toyota has a vested interest in questioning the availability of lithium. It owns many key patents for hybrid cars, and has emphasized them over entirely electric cars that require far more lithium. American and European automakers like Ford Motor and Volkswagen, as well as most Chinese automakers, are still betting on battery-electric cars.
Prototype cars with all-sodium batteries that were disclosed in recent weeks by Chinese domestic carmakers and battery manufacturers have been low-budget microcars. One of them, the Sihao Huaxianzi from JAC Motors, in collaboration with HiNA, a sodium battery start-up, is designed for a top speed of 75 miles an hour.
Pulkit Khurana, a co-founder of Battery Smart, an Indian company that provides batteries for three-wheeled auto rickshaws, expressed doubt that any technology, including sodium, would displace conventional lithium batteries soon. And with the price of lithium having dropped by two-thirds since November, the cost of lithium batteries is likely to drop significantly, he said.
A midsize car or sport utility vehicle would have enough room for a far larger sodium battery than the low-cost subcompacts that Chinese manufacturers are initially building. Another possibility is to use a combination of sodium and lithium cells in a single car battery.
Using an artificial intelligence computer program, China's CATL, the world's largest manufacturer of electric car batteries, has figured out the complex electronics and programming for battery packs with some lithium cells and some sodium cells, said Huang Qisen, the deputy dean of company's research institute.
CATL -- the company's full name is Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. -- said at the auto show that it would make sodium battery cars in cooperation with Chery, a Chinese automaker that is strongest in manufacturing low-cost subcompacts. But both companies declined to provide any details.
Switching to sodium could solve one of the biggest problems with lithium batteries, which put out much less electricity in freezing temperatures.
Because of chemical differences between sodium and lithium, a sodium battery loses less than a tenth of its power at very cold temperatures, according to battery chemistry experts.
"It is promising," said Ouyang Chuying, the president of research and development at CATL. "Sodium has no resource limit."

U.S. Brands Gain Edge With Tax Breaks for E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Rules that take effect on Tuesday will limit the $ 7,500 credits to electric cars made domestically with minerals from the U.S. or trade allies.
American brands like Tesla and General Motors will benefit most from rules that determine which electric vehicles qualify for tax credits starting on Tuesday. Foreign carmakers like Hyundai will be at a significant disadvantage because of restrictions aimed at cutting China out of the supply chain.
Only 10 vehicles will initially qualify for tax credits of $ 7,500, less than a quarter of the battery-powered cars on sale in the United States. But those 10 include many of the most popular models and accounted for two-thirds of electric vehicle sales before the new rules took effect.
Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y, the best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, will qualify for the full $ 7,500 credit, with one exception, according to a list published by the Treasury Department on Monday. The least expensive version of the Model 3 will qualify for only half the credit because its battery is made in China.
G.M.'s Chevrolet Bolt, one of the cheapest electric vehicles on the market, will also qualify, as will sport utility vehicles and pickups that the company plans to begin selling this year.
Fewer Ford vehicles will qualify for the full $ 7,500 credit because of rules requiring that a certain percentage of the battery components and minerals like lithium come from either domestic sources or trade allies. Ford's Mustang Mach-E, the third-best-selling electric vehicle in the United States last year, according to Kelley Blue Book, will be eligible for only half the credit because its Polish-made battery does not meet domestic sourcing requirements. The F-150 Lightning pickup will continue to qualify for the full credit.
Chrysler and Jeep, divisions of Stellantis, do not yet sell cars that run solely on batteries, but several of their hybrid models will qualify for at least some of the credit. Hybrid vehicles can qualify if their batteries have a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours.
The rules give U.S. carmakers at least a temporary advantage over competitors like Toyota, Volkswagen and Nissan. No foreign automakers were on the Treasury list, which is expected to grow as companies adjust their supply chains.
Carmakers that qualify for the tax credits will now have a head start as sales of electric vehicles take off. "It causes a multiplier effect in the market," Paul Jacobson, G.M.'s chief financial officer, told reporters in New York this month. The rules, he added, are "very consistent with the strategy that we had already adopted."
The rules grow out of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed last year to fight climate change and encourage domestic manufacturing among other things. The Treasury Department was responsible for writing regulations based on the legislation.
The law seeks to reduce the auto industry's reliance on China, which makes most of the world's batteries and dominates the processing of raw materials. The law also establishes limits on sales prices and excludes individuals who earn more than $ 150,000 a year and couples who make more than $ 300,000. The rules also exclude vehicles made outside North America, including in allied countries like South Korea and Germany.
"We were not happy," José Muñoz, the chief executive of Hyundai and Genesis Motor North America, said in an interview at the New York International Auto Show this month. Hyundai's Ioniq 6 electric sedan was named World Car of the Year at the show, but will not be eligible for tax credits because it is assembled in South Korea.
Hyundai, based in Seoul, is investing $ 10 billion to build car and battery plants in Georgia, which will allow the company to meet the Inflation Reduction Act requirements -- but not for several years.
Officials at the carmaker and the South Korean government asked the Biden administration to allow Hyundai and Kia cars to qualify for credits while the factories were under construction, but were told that the law did not allow such an exception, Mr. Muñoz said.
The Hyundai car factory in Georgia is expected to begin producing cars in 2025. The battery plant, which Hyundai is building with SK On, will start production in 2026. "We are working on putting ahead that date so we can qualify earlier," Mr. Muñoz said.
Tesla had already told potential buyers that the least expensive version of the Model 3 sedan would qualify for only half the credit, or $ 3,750. This month, Tesla cut the price of that car by $ 1,000 to $ 41,990. After the partial credit is accounted for, the car will effectively cost many buyers a little more than $ 38,000, about as much as a top-of-the-line Honda Accord and cheaper than an entry-level BMW 3 Series sedan.
Other versions of the Model 3 and Model Y S.U.V. will continue to receive the full credit. Tesla sold more electric vehicles in the United States last year than all other carmakers combined, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Some auto executives have said the rules are too restrictive and undermine efforts to limit climate change. Other critics, like Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, have complained that the Biden administration's rules are too lenient.
Administration officials have argued that the regulations strike a balance between promoting electric vehicles and building a domestic supply chain.
By the administration's count, besides the 10 vehicles that qualify for the full credit, seven qualify for half the credit. Vehicles can qualify for half the credit if, for example, their battery components come from the United States, Canada or Mexico but the minerals used to make the batteries do not meet the sourcing requirements.
Ten vehicles that previously qualified, including the Nissan Leaf and the Volkswagen ID.4, will drop off the list, at least temporarily.
The ID.4, an S.U.V. made in Chattanooga, Tenn., did not make the new list because it is still assessing its supply chain. But Pablo Di Si, the chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, said he expected the model to qualify. Volkswagen was fourth behind Tesla, G.M. and Ford in U.S. electric vehicle sales in the first three months of the year, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Five electric vehicles that G.M. sells or is planning to sell this year will qualify. In addition to the Bolt, the Cadillac Lyriq and electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s and the Silverado pickup will qualify for the full credit. G.M. and LG Energy Solution have begun producing battery cells at a factory in Ohio.
The new rules could be revised in response to comments from the public. It is up to carmakers to show that they qualify, but they are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service and could be penalized if they provide incorrect information. The I.R.S. publishes a list of eligible vehicles that is updated regularly.
A provision in the law for commercial vehicles allows companies to collect the credits for all leased vehicles even if the cars don't meet sourcing and manufacturing requirements. Automakers and their dealers can pass on the savings to people who lease cars, and, as a result, Hyundai has seen a spike in leases, Mr. Muñoz said. The company is also offering cars through monthly subscriptions to let customers benefit from tax incentives and try electric cars.
But that will not make up for lost sales, because most people prefer buying rather than leasing or renting cars, Mr. Muñoz said.
"We cannot compete unless we simply drop dramatically the price," he said. "It's impossible to make it work from a financial point of view."

Full text: The intense competition among the country's huge number of start-up carmakers has unsettled what had been a pillar of the economy in the last few years.
A cutthroat price war has erupted in the world's largest automobile market.
Within a week in March, Volkswagen's Chinese joint venture slashed prices on its ID.3 electric cars by 18 percent. Changan Automobile, one of China's state-owned car manufacturers, offered $ 3,000 cash rebates, free charging credits and other incentives for its electric vehicles. BYD, the country's biggest E.V. maker, unveiled a second round of markdowns in a month for some of its older models.
Amid slumping auto sales, car brands are going to extremes to stay competitive, offering dealership giveaways and deep discounts. Over 40 carmakers have discounted electric and gas-powered vehicles in China this year. The discounts have amounted to several hundred dollars for cheaper models, and tens of thousands of dollars for higher-end offerings.
"The severity of this cycle of price cuts is something that I've never seen," said Tu Le, a managing director at the Beijing consultancy Sino Auto Insights, who has worked in the automotive industry in China and the United States for 25 years.
The price competition has unsettled what was a pillar of strength in the last few years, even as strict pandemic measures shook China's economy and undermined efforts by the ruling Chinese Communist Party to instill confidence.
China's car sales fell 13 percent in the first three months of 2023. Sales of traditional automobiles plunged, while growth in electric vehicles slowed, according to the China Passenger Car Association.
China's E.V. market has grown rapidly since 2020 -- doubling in sales last year -- propped up partly by government subsidies. When that program expired in December after 13 years, the competition intensified to attract buyers in an already crowded segment of the market.
At the same time, traditional automakers are scrambling to unload inventory of older cars before tougher national emissions standards starting in July make it difficult to sell diesel- and gas-powered vehicles.
An already jittery market started to spiral in January when Tesla, the American company that makes electric vehicles in Shanghai, lowered prices in China for the second time in three months. Other manufacturers felt pressure to do the same.
This month, Wang Chuanfu, chairman and chief executive of BYD, proposed that the government extend tax exemptions, which reduce the cost of buying electric vehicles, to 2025 instead of allowing them to expire this year. And China's Auto Dealers Chamber of Commerce published an article last month calling for a six-month delay in the new emissions standards.
The price cuts are not limited to China. Tesla has also lowered prices in the United States and Europe, and its competitors have followed suit. But the intensity of competition reflects the reality that China is not only the biggest market for electric vehicles but also the most competitive.
Established domestic carmakers and local start-ups, supported by Beijing's policies encouraging growth of so-called new energy vehicles, flooded the sector, enticed by a once-in-a-generation opportunity to upend the balance of power in the car industry. By one measure, there are around 300 domestic E.V. manufacturers across China.
Didi, China's leading ride-hailing service, has developed an electric car with BYD exclusively for its drivers. Xiaomi, a maker of smartphones, has said it plans to debut an electric car next year. Even Evergrande, the beleaguered property developer, was building electric vehicles, although those plans may be in jeopardy because of its debt woes.
China is the leading market for electric cars, and more were sold there last year than in the rest of the world. Foreign automakers see an urgent need to gain a foothold in China to develop the know-how and manufacturing scale necessary to compete globally.
Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, said the price war "will definitely continue" because of the importance of producing E.V.s in large quantities.
"In the end, companies with small sales, or poor technology will be easily eliminated," Mr. Cui said.
Car companies and dealerships are now pulling out all the stops for customers. Some dealers are offering free vacations or bottles of perfume in exchange for test drives, while some eager sales teams are stalking charging stations in hopes of luring drivers away from the competition.
Last month, a promotional poster from a Toyota dealer in the southern city of Shenzhen generated buzz online. It advertised a free gas-powered sedan with the purchase of a bZ4X, the company's electric sport utility vehicle. A woman who answered the phone at the dealership said there was currently no such deal.
Kevin Yang, 29, said he visited a Volkswagen dealer in Chengdu last month to look at its electric vehicles. He was struck by a sense of desperation among the salespeople.
The salesman stayed well past the end of his workday to plead with him to take a test drive. After Mr. Yang agreed to take the car for a spin, he started receiving daily phone calls from the salesman with offers of lower prices if he was willing to return to the dealership.
"The rat race is really intense now," Mr. Yang said.
There are similarities between the frothy E.V. market in China and the early days of the smartphone boom, when a new technology product attracted scores of upstarts to jostle with established foreign brands.
In 2015, there were more than 100 Chinese smartphone manufacturers -- a number that has been whittled down significantly to four main domestic brands and Apple. Many non-Chinese brands, such as Samsung Electronics, once a mobile phone leader in China, barely register.
Zhu Jiangming, chairman and chief executive of the Chinese E.V. maker Leapmotor, said he saw another similarity. He expects electric car prices to come down faster than traditional cars because, like smartphone makers, E.V. manufacturers will benefit as the prices of components fall and features are improved.
It is possible, Mr. Zhu said, that an average to high-end electric vehicle in China could sell for around $ 7,000 in 10 years. The average price for an electric car in China is already significantly lower than in the rest of the world, around $ 35,000 compared with $ 60,000 in Europe and $ 70,000 in the United States.
William Li, chief executive of Nio, one of the top Chinese electric vehicle companies, said he planned to keep Nio out of the price war, which he called "unhealthy and unsustainable." For traditional gas-powered automakers, "cutting prices is their last resort in trying to secure market share," he said in a statement.
Some executives fear that consumers will become accustomed to waiting for price reductions. The China Automobile Dealers Association said last month that foot traffic to dealerships had soared after markdowns, but that orders had decreased.
Leapmotor and Li Auto sought to assure potential buyers with a guarantee offering to make up the difference if the company lowered prices or offered cash rebates in the next 90 days.
Mr. Yang, the car shopper in Chengdu, said he expected prices to go even lower.
"I heard that there will be more discounts soon," he said. "I'm going to wait a bit."

The Biden administration’s plan to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles — reaching a two-thirds share of new cars in less than a decade — pushes automakers further in a direction they have already been going. But meeting the new timetable will be a challenge.
Most car companies are convinced that a transition to electric vehicles is necessary and inevitable, and they have been spending tens of billions of dollars to develop electric models and build the plants needed to produce the cars and their battery packs.
Ford Motor is aiming to have EVs make up half of its sales by 2030, a big step toward the administration’s target. General Motors has overhauled a Detroit factory to make EVs, and it recently started production at a new battery plant in Ohio. Volkswagen makes an electric model in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Toyota has plans for a battery plant in North Carolina.
But the industry and its customers have a long way to go. Although sales of EVs are rising, they accounted for only 5.8% of the 13.8 million new cars and trucks sold in the United States last year.
The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday is expected to announce auto-pollution limits that are intended to ensure that all-electric models make up 54% to 60% of new vehicles sold in the United States by 2030, and 64% to 67% by 2032.
Those targets will raise the bar on ambitions outlined by President Joe Biden two years ago, when he issued an executive order putting the EV target at 50% of new cars by 2030.
Transportation is the largest source of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to changes in Earth’s climate. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law last year, provides $7,500 in tax incentives for buyers of EVs, which has helped lift EV purchases. The act also provides billions of dollars to support battery production in the United States and the mining and processing of lithium and other minerals needed for battery cells and electric motors.
Still, the push to put EVs into American garages may hinge on people such as John Torrance, of Hamburg, New York, a suburb of Buffalo. A salesperson for a packaging company, he agrees with the idea of cutting greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change, but he has a hard time imagining an EV fitting into his life.
The owner of a 2018 Ford F-150 pickup truck, he often has to haul around a trailer full of equipment for his job, and he sometimes tows a camper for vacations — driving patterns that are not very suitable for EVs. It’s also not unusual for him to have to drive 300 miles on a work trip, and farther when he visits relatives in Michigan.
“I’m a person who likes to go and not have a lot of stops,” he said. “If I’m working, I can’t really wait an hour or more to recharge an EV.”
On top of that, he lives in an apartment, so he would have no way to charge an EV at home.
Whether Americans are willing to accept changes to their work and lifestyle to drive EVs is only one of several hurdles and uncertainties. The biggest is perhaps lithium. The soft, silver-white metal is the key element in EV batteries, and the world produces only a small fraction of the amount that will be needed for a majority of car buyers to go electric in the United States, Europe and China, markets where more than 50 million cars were sold last year.
“Can we really produce enough lithium for that?” asked Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst who follows the electric car business. “We’re not even at 10% now, and it’s difficult for companies to get the lithium they need.”
Although mining companies are racing to expand lithium production, the pace at which they can is unclear. In North Carolina, for example, Albemarle is trying to reopen a pit mine along Interstate 85 near Kings Mountain, 32 miles west of Charlotte.
The mine was in operation from the 1940s to the 1980s, and to reopen it, the company must work out plans for protecting surrounding groundwater, determining if the mine’s steep walls are suitable for new operations and dealing with any contaminants that may be found in the pit lake at the mine’s bottom.
Extracting lithium from the hard ore at the site involves a more difficult and costly process than other sources, and residents in the area have begun working to block the resumption of mining operations.
The supply and production of other metals — including nickel, rare-earth metals, manganese and cobalt — must also increase to support a tenfold rise in EV sales.
On another front, the plants and assembly lines needed to produce millions of EVs every year don’t exist yet. Although GM, Ford and other manufacturers have plants under construction, they will have to produce twice or three times as many battery plants to hit their sales targets and those the Biden administration is setting.
Building and ramping up dozens of new plants will take years, and that process can be fraught. It took GM about three years to complete its battery plant near Lordstown, Ohio, and the start of production has been slow. In the first three months of this year, GM sold fewer than 1,000 EVs with battery packs from the Ohio factory.
Rivian and Lucid, two EV startups, have struggled for more than a year to get plants rolling at the expected pace. Even Ford, which started making its electric F-150 Lightning pickup a year ago, produced just over 2,000 of them a month in the first quarter of this year. Sales of another EV, the Mustang Mach-E, fell 20% that quarter. The company’s goal is to be able to produce 600,000 EVs a year by the start of 2024, and to make 2 million a year by the start of 2027.
Established automakers must balance how fast they increase sales of EVs with how fast they dial back production of the internal-combustion models that currently generate almost all of their profits. Ford recently said it expected its EV division to lose about $3 billion this year, although it forecasts that the unit will be solidly profitable by 2026.
Torrance’s issues with vehicle-charging and apartment-living highlight another obstacle. If tens of millions of people are driving EVs, an exponential increase in the number of public charging stations will be needed, especially of the DC-powered fast-charging stations.
Lastly, even with the tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, EVs remain substantially more expensive than conventional vehicles.
Despite the difficulties, Ramsey thinks that continued efforts on all fronts could move the country close to the administration’s goals.
“Two years ago, I would have said there’s no way we get there,” he said. “Now, I’d say it’s at least possible.”

General Motors Reports Raise in Quarterly Sales, Citing a Robust Demand: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: General Motors and several rivals cited robust demand in the first quarter. But affordability is a growing challenge for many buyers.
Automakers have mostly overcome the supply-chain challenges that upended production early in the pandemic. Now they are trying to weather a new challenge: higher borrowing costs for their customers.
General Motors and several other automakers reported on Monday that new-vehicle sales increased substantially in the first three months of the year, thanks to improved supplies of key components and firm demand from both consumers and commercial customers.
But the steady interest rate increases in the last 12 months have raised questions about whether the industry can maintain its sales momentum throughout 2023.
Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist at the market research firm Cox Automotive, said higher rates were already starting to put new vehicles out of the reach of buyers with lower incomes or weaker credit scores.
According to Cox, "subprime" borrowers -- those with weaker credit profiles -- make up just under 6 percent of all new-car purchases, down from 18 percent five years ago. Car buyers paid an average interest rate of 8.95 percent last month, up from 5.66 percent in March 2022.
The average monthly payment on new vehicles was $ 784 in February, compared with $ 681 a year earlier, Cox calculated.
"Affordability challenges are limiting access to the vehicle market," Mr. Smoke said. "Higher interest rates are having a huge impact."
Sticker prices have also challenged buyers. Auto prices -- for new and used vehicles alike -- have been a prominent driver of inflation over the last two years, although there are signs they are cooling off. The average price for a new car or light truck in February was $ 48,763, according to Cox -- up from $ 46,297 a year earlier, but down from $ 49,468 in January.
Mr. Smoke said automakers got off to a strong start in January and February, but saw credit tighten somewhat in March after the banking industry was shaken by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.
G.M. said its new-vehicle sales in the United States rose 18 percent in the first three months of the year, to 603,208 cars and trucks. Sales to consumers rose 15 percent and sales to rental, corporate and government fleet customers increased 27 percent.
In the last several months, G.M. has been able to keep its factories humming as a result of steadier supplies of computer chips and other critical parts. The company ended the quarter with 412,285 vehicles in dealer stocks, up slightly from what it had at the end of 2022, but nearly 140,000 more than it had a year earlier.
Honda Motor reported that its U.S. sales increased 7 percent to 284,507 cars and trucks, while Nissan saw a gain of 17 percent, to 235,818. Hyundai said its U.S. sales rose 16 percent to 184,449.
Toyota Motor, however, has continued to suffered from parts shortages that have left its dealers with slim inventories. Its first-quarter sales fell 9 percent to 469,558 cars and trucks. Stellantis, formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot SA, also reported a decline. Its sales fell 9 percent to 368,327 cars and trucks.
Ford Motor is scheduled to report its latest sales figures on Tuesday.
G.M. has forecast a rapid increase this year in sales of electric vehicles; so far, it is off to an uneven start. The company sold 19,700 Chevrolet Bolt compacts in the first quarter, more than three times the total a year earlier, but other models have yet to make a splash.
Sales of the Cadillac Lyriq, an electric sport-utility vehicle, totaled just 968, and G.M. sold only two GMC Hummer E.V.s, down from 99 in the first quarter of 2022.
G.M. started production last summer at a new plant in Ohio that is supposed to provide battery packs for the Hummer E.V., the Lyriq and several other vehicles scheduled to arrive in showrooms this year. They include electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and the Chevy Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Biden administration hopes its guidelines for up to $ 7,500 in tax credits will encourage automakers to reduce their reliance on China for batteries and raw materials.
The Biden administration on Friday released new rules that will significantly shorten the list of electric vehicles that qualify for federal tax credits. Officials hope the change will push carmakers to move their supply chains out of China and to the United States or its allies.
The rules, issued by the Treasury Department, are a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed last year to fight climate change by encouraging the use of zero-emission vehicles and green energy. The law also seeks to reduce the industry's reliance on China, which makes most of the world's batteries and dominates the processing of critical raw materials.
For purchases of their electric cars to qualify for up to $ 7,500 in tax credits, automakers must meet strict requirements for where they assemble the cars and batteries and where they get the materials that go into batteries. Only a handful of vehicles are expected to qualify for the full credit when the rules, which are more stringent than previous requirements, go into effect April 18, down from 21 now.
The new rules, which could be revised in response to comments from the public, will require that a certain percentage of the components and minerals in each electric car's battery come from domestic sources or countries with which the United States has trade agreements.
The full list of qualifying cars will not be published for a couple of weeks, but Tesla has begun informing buyers that the changes would affect its lineup. The company said on its website that the least expensive version of its Model 3 sedan, one of the most popular electric cars, would no longer be eligible for the full credit. The car uses a battery made in China.
General Motors said Friday that three electric vehicles it plans to sell this year -- the Cadillac Lyriq and electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer sport utility vehicles -- would qualify for the full credit.
James M. Wickett, a partner at Hogan Lovells who focuses on tax and energy policy, said the electric vehicle tax credit was "moving supply chains, to the tune of tens of billions."
"The details matter in a significant way," he added.
One significant detail on Friday expanded the program to include battery minerals from Japan and paved the way for adding more countries, such as the 27 members of the European Union.
Officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have also begun discussing plans to build a kind of buyers' club for critical minerals that could exert pressure over the global industry, including setting higher labor and environmental standards for mining, processing and manufacturing.
The race is on for manufacturers whose vehicles don't qualify for the U.S. tax credits to procure the minerals and components that will satisfy the requirements. The credit awards a significant competitive advantage to any car that makes the grade.
To be eligible, at least 50 percent of the components in an electric car battery must be made in North America. And 40 percent of the minerals used to make the batteries, which often contain nickel, manganese and cobalt, must come from domestic sources or from countries that have trade agreements with the United States. The minerals quota will rise every year until it reaches 80 percent by 2027, and the component quota will climb to 100 percent in 2029.
The administration said it would later issue rules clarifying how much investment that companies could receive from countries like China and Russia and still qualify for tax credits. The law includes prohibitions on using critical minerals and battery components from a "foreign entity of concern," a term that includes companies based in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.
Siyu Huang, the chief executive of Factorial Energy, a Massachusetts company that is developing advanced batteries with backing from Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Stellantis, welcomed the trade agreement with Japan. But she said it would be "very challenging" to acquire battery-grade lithium because almost all the refineries are in China.
"The critical part of this is really about where the lithium is coming from," Ms. Huang said.
In writing the rules, Biden officials have tried to balance two priorities: Encouraging Americans to buy cleaner cars to mitigate climate change, and trying to bring more factories for cars, batteries and battery materials to the United States and its allies.
Company executives, and some analysts, said the administration had come down on the side of the latter goal. Given the limited number of vehicles that currently qualify for tax credits, some consumers could decide to wait to buy an electric car until more become eligible in a few years, said William Reinsch, the Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
"What always happens if people are uncertain is they hold on to their wallets," Mr. Reinsch said.
Jennifer Safavian, the chief executive of Autos Drive America, which represents foreign carmakers like Toyota, Honda and Volkswagen, welcomed Japan's inclusion and said it would help strengthen supply chains. Yet, she added, the drop in the number of eligible cars would slow the growth of electric cars.
But some lawmakers complain the Biden administration has been too generous to foreign companies. Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a pivotal player in the Inflation Reduction Act's writing and passage, said this week that he may bring a court case challenging the administration's interpretation of the law.
In a statement Friday, Mr. Manchin said that the Treasury Department's guidance "completely ignores the intent" of the act.
"It is horrific that the administration continues to ignore the purpose of the law, which is to bring manufacturing back to America and ensure we have reliable and secure supply chains," he said. "American tax dollars should not be used to support manufacturing jobs overseas."
The legislation has already shaken up the car industry. Immediately after President Biden signed the bill in August, a provision excluded from the tax credits any electric vehicles not made in the United States, Mexico or Canada.
Hyundai and Kia cars made in South Korea no longer qualified, angering that nation's leaders, who felt betrayed by a close military and trade partner. Sales of South Korean-made electric vehicles have since lost market share in the United States.
The law also proved to be a major source of friction diplomatically. Leaders of the European Union, Japan and other U.S. allies feared the program would lure investment away from their countries or force them to offer more generous subsidies to compete with the United States.
Because the European Union, Japan and Britain do not have free-trade agreements with the United States, products from those countries, including battery materials, did not qualify for any portion of the tax credits.
Under pressure from foreign governments, the Biden administration proposed a workaround. In a news release, the Treasury Department said the law did not define the term "free trade agreement," which "could include newly negotiated critical minerals agreements." The Biden administration signed a limited trade deal with Japan on Tuesday covering critical minerals, and is negotiating a similar deal with the European Union.
But the strategy has been strongly criticized by lawmakers in Congress, who have said the administration failed to consult with them on trade policy, or argue that U.S. taxpayer money will now subsidize Japanese industry.
For consumers, the new rules are likely to make many electric vehicles more expensive.
At least some Tesla vehicles are likely to remain eligible. The company makes cars in California and Texas and batteries in Nevada. Ford Motor said it would "soon" disclose whether any of its vehicles qualify.
Carmakers will have to certify whether their vehicles meet the components and minerals requirements. The Internal Revenue Service will enforce the rules. Some vehicles may qualify for only half the credit if, for example, they meet the component quotas but not the minerals quotas.
The list of eligible cars is expected to grow as it becomes easier for companies to buy processed lithium and other materials from U.S. trade partners like Canada and Australia. Numerous companies are developing mines and building refineries. More cars will also qualify once Hyundai, Ford, Honda and other automakers finish building new car and battery plants in the United States.
And a loophole in the law allows companies to collect the credits if they lease vehicles to customers, even if the cars don't meet sourcing and manufacturing requirements. Automakers and their dealers could pass on those credits to consumers by reducing monthly lease payments.

Insurgent Wins Bid for U.A.W. Presidency: [National Desk]

Full text: Shawn Fain, an insurgent, edged Ray Curry after calling for a harder line in contract talks. The union has been dogged by corruption scandals.
An insurgent candidate has won the presidency of the United Auto Workers union, potentially setting the organization on a more confrontational path as it heads into contract talks this year with the three Detroit automakers.
Shawn Fain, a 54-year-old electrician who has been a member of the union for almost three decades, defeated the incumbent, Ray Curry, after a monthslong election battle in which Mr. Fain's allies won seats across the union's executive board.
Mr. Fain claimed victory on Saturday, and Mr. Curry conceded, as a court-appointed election monitor neared the end of the vote count.
Mr. Curry, a 57-year-old former assembly line worker with a master's degree in business administration, was appointed president in 2021 after a broad federal investigation into a series of corruption scandals. He had carried out a number of reforms but ultimately was seen by many members as not enough of a break with previous presidents and executives linked to wrongdoing.
With the count nearly complete, Mr. Fain had 69,459 votes, or 50.2 percent, and Mr. Curry had 68,976, according to an unofficial tally. The count had gone on for weeks, prolonged by the inspection of challenged ballots.
Mr. Curry said Mr. Fain would be sworn in on Sunday and would preside over a convention to hammer out plans for the contract talks.
The vote was a runoff after a contest in November in which Mr. Curry collected about 600 more votes than Mr. Fain but neither man reached the 50 percent threshold to be declared the winner.
"The winds of change run strongly through this election," said Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, who has followed the U.A.W. for more than three decades. "It defines the direction of the U.A.W. going forward."
Mr. Fain said he intended to be more confrontational in contract negotiations, a position that appealed to members after years of concessions on wages and benefits and following corruption scandals that ended with two former presidents serving time in prison.
"This is the end of company unionism, where the companies and the union work together in a friendly way, because it hasn't been good for our members," he said in an interview as the vote count neared completion. "These companies have enjoyed record profits for a decade, and our workers are still regressing and struggling to get by."
Insurgents aligned with him won a majority of offices on the union's international executive board -- an outcome widely seen as reflecting the members' desire for significant change at the top of the union.
But Mr. Fain and the new administration have little experience in running the union's operations.
It was the first election open to all members of the union, and had been mandated by a court-appointed monitor who has been overseeing the union's efforts to wipe out corruption. Previously, the union's presidents and other senior officials were chosen by delegates to a convention, in which the result was often determined by favors and favoritism and did not always reflect the sentiments of rank-and-file workers.
"I knew our members were fed up," Mr. Fain said. "It was just a matter of whether they were willing to vote for change, because they've never been able to do that before."
The shake-up comes as the U.A.W. is about to start talks with General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis on four-year labor contracts. The talks come as the automakers are again earning significant profits. G.M. reported profits of $ 9.9 billion for 2022. Ford reported a loss, but its North American operation remains its main profit generator. Stellantis, which was formed by a merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA in 2021, made 17 billion euros, with a large share coming from North America.
It also occurs as the automakers are making the transition from gasoline-powered vehicles to electric ones, which have fewer moving parts and require less labor.
"The union is in the midst of a most important transition since the introduction of the assembly line with the move toward electric vehicles, and that could result in the loss of a lot of automotive jobs," Professor Shaiken said. "How the new leadership navigates that will impact the U.A.W. and the labor movement."
For decades after its founding in 1935, the U.A.W. had the power to influence presidential elections and consistently won middle-class wages and benefits that set the standard for workers in many industries across the country. At its peak, in 1979, it had 1.5 million members.
But the U.A.W.'s membership and influence steadily declined as the Detroit automakers faced increasing competition from Toyota and other foreign automakers that were building nonunion plants across the South. As those rivals gained a greater foothold, the American companies reduced their payrolls and shut factories.
The 2009 bankruptcy filings by G.M. and Chrysler -- which is now part of Stellantis -- forced the union into major concessions, including a wage system that left newcomers earning substantially less than veteran workers.
While diminished, the U.A.W. still has influence. "The union can still turn out voters in critical states like Michigan and Ohio and other states that can determine a presidential election," Professor Shaiken said.
The U.A.W. now has about 400,000 active members, including college teaching assistants and casino workers as well as auto manufacturing workers. Both active members and the union's 600,000 retirees were eligible to vote in the elections.
For the last several years the U.A.W. has been reeling from a federal corruption investigation that eventually found a number of schemes in which senior officials embezzled millions of dollars from union coffers. They spent some of the money on expensive cigars, wines, liquor, golf clubs, apparel and luxury travel.
In total, federal investigators found that $ 1.5 million had been siphoned from membership dues, and $ 3.5 million from union training centers. More than a dozen U.A.W. officials pleaded guilty, and two former presidents, Gary Jones and Dennis Williams, were sentenced to prison. Each was released after serving nine months.
As part of a consent decree settling the investigation, the U.S. District Court in Detroit appointed an outside monitor to oversee the implementation of democratic and transparency reforms. One of the mandated reforms was a one-person-one-vote election.

Swiping at China, Lawmakers Grill Leader of TikTok: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lawmakers grilled Shou Chew, TikTok's chief executive, over the app's ties to its Chinese parent company and its effects on children, as Chinese officials said they opposed a sale of the platform.
Lawmakers lambasted TikTok's chief executive about the platform's ties to China in a roughly five-hour hearing on Thursday, punctuating how the viral video app has become a central battleground as the United States and China tussle for political, technological and economic primacy.
Shou Chew, the chief executive of TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese internet giant ByteDance, was barraged with questions about the app's relationship to its parent company and China's potential influence over the platform. Republican and Democratic lawmakers repeatedly asked Mr. Chew if TikTok was spying on Americans on behalf of the Chinese government, cut him off midsentence and angrily demanded "yes" or "no" answers from him.
The hearing, a rare display of bipartisan unity that was harsher in tone than previous congressional hearings featuring American executives of social media companies, was complicated by Chinese authorities weighing in. Hours before Mr. Chew testified, China's commerce ministry said it opposed a sale of TikTok, in a public rebuke of the Biden administration, which has demanded the divestiture and threatened a possible U.S. ban of the app.
That left Mr. Chew, 40, in a difficult position as he struggled to cast TikTok as an independent company that wasn't influenced by China. "ByteDance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government," he said at one point, a response that visibly frustrated lawmakers. "It is a private company."
The hearing and China's statement cemented how TikTok has become a focal point of geopolitical tensions between the United States and China. President Biden and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, are both campaigning to bolster their own technology sectors and have disrupted trade to each other's countries as suspicions between Washington and Beijing have mounted.
With the United States and China at odds over a TikTok sale, there are basically two paths for the app in the United States. The Biden administration could ban the app, which may run into a difficult court challenge, or it could revisit stalled negotiations for a technical fix to data security concerns.
But even as the White House considers those options, the striking bipartisan unity at Thursday's hearing was a boon for President Biden as he takes a hard line against China. Nearly every policy he has pursued has been forcefully rejected by Republicans, except for his tough position against China on trade, technology dominance, the Ukraine war and other matters.
"The future of TikTok in the U.S. is definitely dimmer and more uncertain today than it was yesterday," said Lindsay Gorman, head of technology and geopolitics at the German Marshall Fund and a former tech adviser for the Biden administration. "It's not just one side of the aisle clamoring for TikTok to address these national security concerns, but this is now coming from all sides."
To continue operating in the United States without changing its Chinese ownership, TikTok had proposed ways to protect American users by walling off their data, among other steps. But no security agreement had been reached and U.S. intelligence officials had warned that the app might be an arm of the Chinese government that spies on Americans and spreads propaganda.
The stakes heightened in recent weeks, with the Biden administration pushing for TikTok to be sold off from its Chinese owners or face a possible ban on American soil. But China's comments on Thursday against a sale narrows what the White House can potentially do to contain the app without escalating tensions, leading to acrimonious exchanges at the hearing with Mr. Chew.
It is rare for chief executives of foreign-owned companies to testify in Congress, with one of the last times being when Toyota's president appeared in 2010 to discuss the recalls of millions of cars.
Over the past few years, Republican and Democratic lawmakers have increasingly coalesced around the growing animus against Chinese businesses in the United States, with government bans on exports to Chinese telecommunications companies and several bills that aim to limit TikTok and other technologies tied to hostile foreign governments.
At the hearing, more than 50 lawmakers expressed deep skepticism of Mr. Chew's defense. They portrayed TikTok as a danger to national security, accusing it of invading people's privacy, harming the mental health of teenagers and leading to the deaths of some young people. August Pfluger, a Republican lawmaker from Texas, told Mr. Chew that the chief executive had inspired political unity that hadn't been seen in three or four years.
"We do not trust TikTok will ever embrace American values," said Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican of Washington and the chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which held the hearing. "TikTok has repeatedly chosen the path for more control, more surveillance and more manipulation. Your platform should be banned."
In a statement, a TikTok spokeswoman said the hearing "was dominated by political grandstanding."
Mr. Chew tried distancing TikTok from China, stressing that he was born in Singapore and that he lives there with his wife, who was born in Virginia, and two children. He emphasized early on that he attended business school in the United States.
But he acknowledged that he reports directly to ByteDance's chief executive, Liang Rubo, and that some TikTok employees participate in ByteDance's incentive plans for stock options.
Mr. Chew argued that banning TikTok would be a strike against free expression. The app serves many small businesses and creators and has 150 million U.S. users and 7,000 employees in the country.
He also repeatedly pointed to efforts to protect the data of Americans. The company came up with a plan, Project Texas, to store the data of American users on domestic servers run by the Texas-based software giant, Oracle. He insisted that the data security program, which the Biden administration has rejected, would be the best way to protect consumers.
"The bottom line is this: American data is stored on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel," Mr. Chew said.
Lawmakers remained skeptical. Several brought up China's declaration that it would oppose TikTok's sale, saying it was evidence of the country's influence over the company. They cited reports of ByteDance's surveillance of American journalists as proof of the company's abuse of privacy and user security. In December, ByteDance said that its China-based employees had retrieved the sensitive data of U.S. TikTok users, including reporters, to try to find who was leaking internal information to journalists.
"I'm not convinced that the benefits outweigh the risks that it poses to Americans in its present form," Frank Pallone, the ranking Democrat of New Jersey, said of TikTok. "The combination of TikTok's Beijing communist-based China ownership and its popularity exacerbates its danger to our country and to our privacy."
Concerns over TikTok increased during the Trump administration. In 2020, President Donald J. Trump tried, unsuccessfully, to ban TikTok from Apple's and Google's app stores unless it was sold to an American buyer. A deal to sell stakes in the app to Oracle and Walmart never came together.
After the Biden administration came into office, it initially focused on negotiating the security deal that would allow TikTok to keep operating in the United States. That changed in recent weeks with the White House's demand that TikTok's Chinese owners sell the app. The administration also backed a new bill, sponsored by Senators Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, that would give it more power to ban TikTok.
Mr. Chew, who was appointed TikTok's chief executive in May 2021, has in recent months embarked on a charm offensive in Washington, meeting with lawmakers, think tank leaders and journalists. This week, he tried garnering support with a video on TikTok's official account, warning users that politicians "could take TikTok away from all 150 million of you."
TikTok has support from free speech proponents, who warned against banning the app.
"Banning or restricting access to social media is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes, and we should be very wary about giving the U.S. government that kind of power," Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said in a statement.
Lawmakers also raised concerns about TikTok and young Americans in the hearing. The app is used by 67 percent of U.S. teenagers, according to the Pew Research Center. TikTok has faced criticism that it's too addictive and that its algorithm can bombard teens with videos that put them in dangerous and even lethal situations.
"TikTok could be designed to minimize the harm to kids, but a decision was made to aggressively addict kids in the name of profits," Representative Kathy Castor, Democrat of Florida, said during the hearing.
Mr. Chew said TikTok had worked to limit the repetition of videos about topics like extreme exercise and that the app's guidelines did not allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders. He also pointed to new 60-minute screen time limits, which parents can control, for users 12 and under, and prompts that now appear after 60 minutes for 13- to 17-year-olds.
Lawmakers weren't assuaged. Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, Democrat of Delaware, said Mr. Chew's testimony solidified concerns over the company's ties to China, data privacy violations and how the app treats children.
"I think that really summarizes why you see so much bipartisan consensus and concerns about your company," she said. "And I imagine that it's not going away anytime soon."

WASHINGTON — Lawmakers lambasted TikTok’s CEO about the platform’s ties to China in a roughly five-hour hearing Thursday, punctuating how the viral video app has become a central battleground as the United States and China tussle for political, technological and economic primacy.
Shou Chew, the CEO of TikTok, which is owned by Chinese internet giant ByteDance, was barraged with questions about the app’s relationship to its parent company and China’s potential influence over the platform. Republican and Democratic lawmakers repeatedly asked Chew if TikTok was spying on Americans on behalf of the Chinese government, cut him off midsentence and angrily demanded “yes” or “no” answers from him.
The hearing, a rare display of bipartisan unity that was harsher in tone than previous congressional hearings featuring American executives of social media companies, was complicated by Chinese authorities weighing in. Hours before Chew testified, China’s commerce ministry said it opposed a sale of TikTok, in a public rebuke of the Biden administration, which has demanded the divestiture and threatened a possible U.S. ban of the app.
That left Chew, 40, in a difficult position as he struggled to cast TikTok as an independent company that wasn’t influenced by China. “ByteDance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government,” he said at one point, a response that visibly frustrated lawmakers. “It is a private company.”
The hearing and China’s statement cemented how TikTok has become a focal point of geopolitical tensions between the United States and China. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are both campaigning to bolster their own technology sectors and have disrupted trade to each other’s countries as suspicions between Washington and Beijing have mounted.
With the United States and China at odds over a TikTok sale, there are basically two paths for the app in the United States. The Biden administration could ban the app, which might run into a difficult court challenge, or it could revisit stalled negotiations for a technical fix to data security concerns.
But even as the White House considers those options, the striking bipartisan unity at Thursday’s hearing was a boon for Biden as he takes a hard line against China. Nearly every policy he has pursued has been forcefully rejected by Republicans, except for his tough position against China on trade, technology dominance, the Ukraine war and other matters.
“The future of TikTok in the U.S. is definitely dimmer and more uncertain today than it was yesterday,” said Lindsay Gorman, head of technology and geopolitics at the German Marshall Fund and a former tech adviser for the Biden administration. “It’s not just one side of the aisle clamoring for TikTok to address these national security concerns, but this is now coming from all sides.”
To continue operating in the United States without changing its Chinese ownership, TikTok had proposed ways to protect American users by walling off their data, among other steps. But no security agreement had been reached, and U.S. intelligence officials had warned that the app might be an arm of the Chinese government that spies on Americans and spreads propaganda.
The stakes heightened in recent weeks, with the Biden administration pushing for TikTok to be sold off from its Chinese owners or face a possible ban on American soil. But China’s comments Thursday against a sale narrows what the White House can potentially do to contain the app without escalating tensions, leading to acrimonious exchanges at the hearing with Chew.
It is rare for CEOs of foreign-owned companies to testify in Congress, with one of the last times being when Toyota’s president appeared in 2010 to discuss the recalls of millions of cars.
Over the past few years, Republican and Democratic lawmakers have increasingly coalesced around the growing animus against Chinese businesses in the United States, with government bans on exports to Chinese telecommunications companies and several bills that aim to limit TikTok and other technologies tied to hostile foreign governments.
At the hearing, more than 50 lawmakers expressed deep skepticism of Chew’s defense. They portrayed TikTok as a danger to national security, accusing it of invading people’s privacy, harming the mental health of teenagers and leading to the deaths of some young people. Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, told Chew that the CEO had inspired political unity that hadn’t been seen in three or four years.
“We do not trust TikTok will ever embrace American values,” said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., the chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which held the hearing. “TikTok has repeatedly chosen the path for more control, more surveillance and more manipulation. Your platform should be banned.”
In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson said the hearing “was dominated by political grandstanding.”
Chew tried distancing TikTok from China, stressing that he was born in Singapore and that he lives there with his wife, who was born in Virginia, and two children. He emphasized early on that he attended business school in the United States.
But he acknowledged that he reports directly to ByteDance CEO Liang Rubo and that some TikTok employees participate in ByteDance’s incentive plans for stock options.
Chew argued that banning TikTok would be a strike against free expression. The app serves many small businesses and creators and has 150 million American users and 7,000 employees in the U.S.
He also repeatedly pointed to efforts to protect the data of Americans. The company came up with a plan, Project Texas, to store the data of U.S. users on domestic servers run by Texas-based software giant Oracle. He insisted that the data security program, which the Biden administration has rejected, would be the best way to protect consumers.
“The bottom line is this: American data is stored on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel,” Chew said.
Lawmakers remained skeptical. Several brought up China’s declaration that it would oppose TikTok’s sale, saying it was evidence of the country’s influence over the company. They cited reports of ByteDance’s surveillance of American journalists as proof of the company’s abuse of privacy and user security. In December, ByteDance said its China-based employees had retrieved sensitive data of U.S. TikTok users, including reporters, to try to find who was leaking internal information to journalists.
“I’m not convinced that the benefits outweigh the risks that it poses to Americans in its present form,” Frank Pallone, the ranking Democrat of New Jersey, said of TikTok. “The combination of TikTok’s Beijing communist-based China ownership and its popularity exacerbates its danger to our country and to our privacy.”
Concerns over TikTok increased during the Trump administration. In 2020, President Donald Trump tried, unsuccessfully, to ban TikTok from Apple’s and Google’s app stores unless it was sold to an American buyer. A deal to sell stakes in the app to Oracle and Walmart never came together.
After the Biden administration came into office, it initially focused on negotiating the security deal that would allow TikTok to keep operating in the United States. That changed in recent weeks with the White House’s demand that TikTok’s Chinese owners sell the app. The administration also backed a new bill, sponsored by Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and John Thune, R-S.D., that would give it more power to ban TikTok.
Chew, who was appointed TikTok’s CEO in May 2021, has in recent months embarked on a charm offensive in Washington, meeting with lawmakers, think tank leaders and journalists. This week, he tried garnering support with a video on TikTok’s official account, warning users that politicians “could take TikTok away from all 150 million of you.”
TikTok has support from free speech proponents, who warned against banning the app.
“Banning or restricting access to social media is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes, and we should be very wary about giving the U.S. government that kind of power,” Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said in a statement.
Lawmakers also raised concerns about TikTok and young Americans in the hearing. The app is used by 67% of U.S. teenagers, according to the Pew Research Center. TikTok has faced criticism that it’s too addictive and that its algorithm can bombard teens with videos that put them in dangerous and even lethal situations.
“TikTok could be designed to minimize the harm to kids, but a decision was made to aggressively addict kids in the name of profits,” Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., said during the hearing.
Chew said TikTok had worked to limit the repetition of videos about topics such as extreme exercise and that the app’s guidelines did not allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders. He also pointed to new 60-minute screen time limits, which parents can control, for users 12 and younger, and prompts that appear after 60 minutes for 13- to 17-year-olds.
Lawmakers weren’t assuaged. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., said Chew’s testimony solidified concerns over the company’s ties to China, data privacy violations and how the app treats children.
“I think that really summarizes why you see so much bipartisan consensus and concerns about your company,” she said. “And I imagine that it’s not going away anytime soon.”

Brands Ditch the Plastic Waste To Bring You a Greener Cleaner: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Headway is an initiative from The New York Times exploring the world's challenges through the lens of progress. We look for promising solutions, notable experiments and lessons from what's been tried.
Every week, Angela Espinoza Pierson looked at her recycling bin -- filled with detergent jugs, shampoo bottles and clamshell containers that once held strawberries -- with mixed feelings. Sure, it was a lot of plastic. But it was going to be recycled.
Or so she thought. Then her husband sent her some articles revealing that less than 6 percent of the country's plastic gets recycled, and that even recycled plastic can only be reused once or twice. Ms. Espinoza Pierson, who lives in Buda, Texas, was shocked. "All the plastic that we thought was getting recycled, it's not really, and it's just going to sit there," she said.
Determined to cut back on her plastic consumption, Ms. Espinoza Pierson got a starter kit from a company selling refillable household cleaners. In it were tablets containing concentrated hand soap as well as multi-surface, glass and bathroom cleaners -- and four empty containers. She filled each one with tap water, then dropped in a tablet and watched it dissolve. If she is happy with the cleaners, she will order more tablets but reuse the containers. No new plastic required.
Given plastic's detrimental effects on the environment, nearly three-quarters of Americans say they are trying to reduce their reliance on single-use plastic, according to Pew Research Center. Since plastic is everywhere and avoiding it altogether is extraordinarily difficult, some, like Ms. Espinoza Pierson, have revived a once-customary practice: refilling containers rather than disposing of them. If just 10 to 20 percent of plastic packaging were reused, a report from the World Economic Forum estimates, the amount of plastic waste entering the ocean could be cut in half.
Though environmentally minded consumers have long been able to refill containers by making their own concoctions or shopping at certain stores -- like the now-proliferating number of zero-waste boutiques -- finding mass market refillable products has been more challenging.
That's started to change. Over the past few years, Windex, owned by SC Johnson, introduced concentrates that dissolve in water; Dove began selling a deodorant stick that slots into a reusable case; and The Body Shop added refill stations to half its American stores.
These are tiny experiments in a country that generates nearly 500 pounds of plastic waste per person, per year. But Matt Prindiville, the chief executive of Upstream, a reuse advocacy organization and consultancy, says his organization has seen the number of reuse-refill start-ups grow from a dozen in 2019 to more than 150 today. "If you asked me about this three years ago, I wouldn't have guessed at how quickly the interest in the sector has blown up," Mr. Prindiville said. "Not just from the do-gooders, but from the biggest brands in the world."
'We're Just Shipping Around Water'
American beverage companies switched to single-use plastic containers during the 1970s, largely because it saved money, said Bart Elmore, an associate professor of environmental history at Ohio State University. No longer would companies have to collect or clean refillable bottles.
Since throwing things away, rather than cleaning and reusing them, was convenient, too, it seemed like progress. An ad for Toss'ems, a single-use baby bottle introduced in 1971, summed up the ethos with a question: "In this disposable age, is there a reason for the non-disposable bottle?" Manufacturers and consumers alike fell in love with the lightweight and unbreakable material. More than a third of all plastic ever produced has been used for packaging, most of it created and disposed of in the same year.
Today, the pressure to reduce corporate carbon footprints is forcing a second look at all that plastic packaging. "Reuse, for some types of products and packaging," Mr. Prindiville said, "can put a huge dent in reducing those climate impacts."
Household cleaners seem particularly primed for a refill revolution. Whereas shampoo and conditioner involve complicated chemical formulas, many cleaners can be easily concentrated and reconstituted with water. In fact, that's what makes up the bulk of traditional cleaning products, leading Mr. Prindiville to describe the current system this way: "We're just shipping around water. And that's dumb."
In contrast, the concentrated surface cleaners sold by Grove Collaborative each contain 1 ounce of liquid, far less than a standard 16-ounce bottle of ready-to-use cleaner, and thus require less fuel to transport. Grove's spray bottles are meant to be reused, and its concentrates are packaged in glass or aluminum -- materials that, unlike plastic, can be recycled over and over.
Grove's products are now on shelves in more than 5,000 stores, including Target, CVS and Walmart, and the company has seen its net revenue from refillables grow by more than 600 percent since 2018. But with $ 322 million in total revenue, it is a tiny player in the $ 30 billion home care market.
The Clorox Company, on the other hand, has a huge reach. Last year, the $ 7.1 billion company, which sells products in 100 countries, stepped into the refillable market with cleaning spray concentrates that can be emptied into a reusable plastic spray bottle. (Packaging accounts for more than half of all trigger spray manufacturers' greenhouse gas emissions, transportation for another third.)
This product has been in the works since 2019, when Clorox pledged to halve its virgin plastic and fiber packaging by 2030. Jodi Russell, the vice president of research and development for Clorox's cleaning division, was one of the people tasked with making it happen.
Along with her colleagues, Ms. Russell, who is a chemical engineer, spent the better part of three years formulating the concentrate, developing the supply chains to manufacture it, and sourcing longer-lasting bottles and spray triggers.
Though refillables account for just 5 percent of all trigger-spray sales, Ms. Russell is eager to see that figure grow. Concentrated cleaners not only help manufacturers lower transportation costs and reduce their carbon footprint, she says, but also help retailers by reducing the need for shelf space for bulky bottles.
But research commissioned by Clorox notes that unless all manufacturers adopt refillables, consumers will be confused, ultimately, Ms. Russell said, "destroying all of the economic value." That has led Clorox to become somewhat evangelical about concentrated refillables, hosting presentations at conferences and funding an assessment that showed that switching from ready-to-use trigger sprays to concentrated refills could cut cleaning manufacturers' greenhouse gas emissions from trigger sprays by at least 58 percent.
Not everyone is as enthusiastic. Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and founder of the anti-plastic pollution organization The Last Beach Cleanup, noted that many cleaning products are housed in PET or HDPE, two types of plastic with relatively high recycling rates. So she is less concerned about them -- and far more concerned about the packaging of other products.
"Where these companies should be focusing is on this vast portfolio of everything else that isn't recyclable, that is single use and that often becomes plastic pollution," she said, pointing to SC Johnson's Ziploc bags and Clorox's Hidden Valley ranch dipping cups. "This is just a classic example of big corporations doing a stunt over here on something that's not the main issue to distract from all the single-use plastic they're pushing out."
(In an emailed statement, Alexis Limberakis, senior director of sustainability at The Clorox Company, noted that Hidden Valley Ranch bottles, which make up the majority of that brand's packaging, are made from PET or HDPE, and that the dipping cups "represent a small portion" of Clorox's portfolio.)
The Rocky Road to a Refill Revolution
The biggest roadblock to refills, however, may be consumers. While Americans say they are concerned about plastic, persuading them to switch products -- especially to ones that require an extra step and have a higher upfront cost -- is another story.
Kate White, a professor at the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia, studies what motivates consumers to adopt pro-environmental behaviors. Beyond the perceived inconvenience of refilling in general, she said cleaning routines are deeply ingrained, noting: "If you use Tide, it's quite likely that's what your family used."
Another challenge is that, unlike cars or clothes, cleaning products are literally hidden under the sink. This reduces "social influence," which Dr. White called one of the "main drivers of sustainable behavior."
To that end, Dr. White said refillables could receive a boost if they become "connected to a particular identity," especially one that is "bougie or fancy." But that's a fate environmental advocates are trying to avoid. As Upstream's Mr. Prindiville put it: "We don't want reuse to be the new organic, where you have the wealthier part of the population consuming one way and everybody else consuming a different way."
At the moment, most refillable products are more expensive than their ready-to-use counterparts. A Grove starter kit, for example, costs much more than a ready-to-use spray from Mrs. Meyer's, a brand also marketed as "natural." But refills cost slightly less, which allows consumers to recoup costs over time if they continue reusing the bottle. "We don't have the scale today to deliver at the lowest cost," said Stuart Landesberg, a founder of Grove and the company's chief executive. "But it's not like we're making a Tesla and everyone else is driving a Camry. We're in the same ballpark."
Ms. Russell of Clorox is confident that costs will shrink as the refill market grows. The company had to invest in consumer marketing, new manufacturing equipment and additional packaging with user instructions -- costs that could eventually fall. According to research commissioned by Clorox, the market will reach a tipping point when concentrated refills account for more than half of cleaning spray sales. "That's really when the scale is unlocked," Ms. Russell said.
Both advocates and business owners are hoping that moment arrives soon.
"When I think about the steps we need to take, No. 1 is move people to refillables," Mr. Landesberg said. "It's incredible that we, as a society, feel entitled to create garbage that will last forever for something we're going to use for 90 minutes in aggregate. That is an insane paradigm."

Recyclable? Try Refillable. The Quest For a Greener Cleaner

Every week, Angela Espinoza Pierson looked at her recycling bin — filled with detergent jugs, shampoo bottles and clamshell containers that once held strawberries — with mixed feelings. Sure, it was a lot of plastic. But it was going to be recycled.
Or so she thought. Then her husband sent her some articles revealing that less than 6% of the country’s plastic gets recycled and that even recycled plastic can only be reused once or twice. Espinoza Pierson, who lives in Buda, Texas, was shocked. “All the plastic that we thought was getting recycled, it’s not really, and it’s just going to sit there,” she said.
Determined to cut back on her plastic consumption, Espinoza Pierson got a starter kit from a company selling refillable household cleaners. In it were tablets containing concentrated hand soap as well as multisurface glass and bathroom cleaners — and four empty containers. She filled each one with tap water, then dropped in a tablet and watched it dissolve. If she is happy with the cleaners, she will order more tablets but reuse the containers. No new plastic required.
Given plastic’s detrimental effects on the environment, nearly three-quarters of Americans say they are trying to reduce their reliance on single-use plastic, according to Pew Research Center. Since plastic is everywhere and avoiding it altogether is extraordinarily difficult, some, like Espinoza Pierson, have revived a once-customary practice: refilling containers rather than disposing of them. If just 10% to 20% of plastic packaging were reused, a report from the World Economic Forum estimates, the amount of plastic waste entering the ocean could be cut in half.
Although environmentally minded consumers have long been able to refill containers by making their own concoctions or shopping at certain stores — like the now-proliferating number of zero-waste boutiques — finding mass-market refillable products has been more challenging.
That’s started to change. Over the past few years, Windex, owned by SC Johnson, introduced concentrates that dissolve in water; Dove began selling a deodorant stick that slots into a reusable case; and The Body Shop added refill stations to half its U.S. stores.
These are tiny experiments in a country that generates nearly 500 pounds of plastic waste per person, per year. But Matt Prindiville, the CEO of Upstream, a reuse advocacy organization and consultancy, said his organization has seen the number of reuse-refill startups grow from a dozen in 2019 to more than 150 today. “If you asked me about this three years ago, I wouldn’t have guessed at how quickly the interest in the sector has blown up,” Prindiville said. “Not just from the do-gooders, but from the biggest brands in the world.”
‘We’re Just Shipping Around Water’
U.S. beverage companies switched to single-use plastic containers during the 1970s, largely because it saved money, said Bart Elmore, an associate professor of environmental history at Ohio State University. No longer would companies have to collect or clean refillable bottles.
Since throwing things away, rather than cleaning and reusing them, was convenient, too, it seemed like progress. An ad for Toss’ems, a single-use baby bottle introduced in 1971, summed up the ethos with a question: “In this disposable age, is there a reason for the non-disposable bottle?” Manufacturers and consumers alike fell in love with the lightweight and unbreakable material. More than one-third of all plastic ever produced has been used for packaging, most of it created and disposed of in the same year.
Today, the pressure to reduce corporate carbon footprints is forcing a second look at all that plastic packaging. “Reuse, for some types of products and packaging,” Prindiville said, “can put a huge dent in reducing those climate impacts.”
Household cleaners seem particularly primed for a refill revolution. Whereas shampoo and conditioner involve complicated chemical formulas, many cleaners can be easily concentrated and reconstituted with water. In fact, that’s what makes up the bulk of traditional cleaning products, leading Prindiville to describe the current system this way: “We’re just shipping around water. And that’s dumb.”
In contrast, the concentrated surface cleaners sold by Grove Collaborative each contain 1 ounce of liquid, far less than a standard 16-ounce bottle of ready-to-use cleaner, and thus require less fuel to transport. Grove’s spray bottles are meant to be reused, and its concentrates are packaged in glass or aluminum — materials that, unlike plastic, can be recycled over and over.
Grove’s products are now on shelves in more than 5,000 stores, including Target, CVS and Walmart, and the company has seen its net revenue from refillables grow by more than 600% since 2018. But with $322 million in total revenue, it is a tiny player in the $30 billion home care market.
The Clorox Co., on the other hand, has a huge reach. Last year, the $7.1 billion company, which sells products in 100 countries, stepped into the refillable market with cleaning spray concentrates that can be emptied into a reusable plastic spray bottle. (Packaging accounts for more than half of all trigger spray manufacturers’ greenhouse gas emissions, transportation for another third.)
This product has been in the works since 2019, when Clorox pledged to halve its virgin plastic and fiber packaging by 2030. Jodi Russell, the vice president of research and development for Clorox’s cleaning division, was one of the people tasked with making it happen.
Along with her colleagues, Russell, who is a chemical engineer, spent the better part of three years formulating the concentrate, developing the supply chains to manufacture it and sourcing longer-lasting bottles and spray triggers.
Although refillables account for just 5% of all trigger-spray sales, Russell is eager to see that figure grow. Concentrated cleaners not only help manufacturers lower transportation costs and reduce their carbon footprint, she said, but also help retailers by reducing the need for shelf space for bulky bottles.
But research commissioned by Clorox notes that unless all manufacturers adopt refillables, consumers will be confused, ultimately, Russell said, “destroying all of the economic value.” That has led Clorox to become somewhat evangelical about concentrated refillables, hosting presentations at conferences and funding an assessment that showed that switching from ready-to-use trigger sprays to concentrated refills could cut cleaning manufacturers’ greenhouse gas emissions from trigger sprays by at least 58%.
Not everyone is as enthusiastic. Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and founder of the anti-plastic pollution organization The Last Beach Cleanup, noted that many cleaning products are housed in PET or HDPE, two types of plastic with relatively high recycling rates. So she is less concerned about them — and far more concerned about the packaging of other products.
“Where these companies should be focusing is on this vast portfolio of everything else that isn’t recyclable, that is single-use and that often becomes plastic pollution,” she said, pointing to SC Johnson’s Ziploc bags and Clorox’s Hidden Valley ranch dipping cups. “This is just a classic example of big corporations doing a stunt over here on something that’s not the main issue to distract from all the single-use plastic they’re pushing out.”
(In an emailed statement, Alexis Limberakis, senior director of sustainability at The Clorox Co., noted that Hidden Valley Ranch bottles, which make up the majority of that brand’s packaging, are made from PET or HDPE and that the dipping cups “represent a small portion” of Clorox’s portfolio.)
The Rocky Road to a Refill Revolution
The biggest roadblock to refills, however, may be consumers. While Americans say they are concerned about plastic, persuading them to switch products — especially to ones that require an extra step and have a higher upfront cost — is another story.
Kate White, a professor at the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia, studies what motivates consumers to adopt pro-environmental behaviors. Beyond the perceived inconvenience of refilling in general, she said cleaning routines are deeply ingrained, noting, “If you use Tide, it’s quite likely that’s what your family used.”
Another challenge is that unlike cars or clothes, cleaning products are literally hidden under the sink. This reduces “social influence,” which White called one of the “main drivers of sustainable behavior.”
To that end, White said refillables could receive a boost if they become “connected to a particular identity,” especially one that is “bougie or fancy.” But that’s a fate environmental advocates are trying to avoid. As Upstream’s Prindiville put it, “We don’t want reuse to be the new organic, where you have the wealthier part of the population consuming one way and everybody else consuming a different way.”
At the moment, most refillable products are more expensive than their ready-to-use counterparts. A Grove starter kit, for example, costs much more than a ready-to-use spray from Mrs. Meyer’s, a brand also marketed as “natural.” But refills cost slightly less, which allows consumers to recoup costs over time if they continue reusing the bottle. “We don’t have the scale today to deliver at the lowest cost,” said Stuart Landesberg, a founder of Grove and the company’s CEO. “But it’s not like we’re making a Tesla, and everyone else is driving a Camry. We’re in the same ballpark.”
Russell of Clorox is confident that costs will shrink as the refill market grows. The company had to invest in consumer marketing, new manufacturing equipment and additional packaging with user instructions — costs that could eventually fall. According to research commissioned by Clorox, the market will reach a tipping point when concentrated refills account for more than half of cleaning spray sales. “That’s really when the scale is unlocked,” Russell said.
Both advocates and business owners are hoping that moment arrives soon.
“When I think about the steps we need to take, No. 1 is move people to refillables,” Landesberg said. “It’s incredible that we, as a society, feel entitled to create garbage that will last forever for something we’re going to use for 90 minutes in aggregate. That is an insane paradigm.”

Volkswagen Points $193 Billion at E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The German automaker announced a plan to accelerate its transition to battery-powered vehicles and bolster operations in China and North America.
Volkswagen said on Tuesday that it would spend $ 193 billion on software, battery factories and other investments as it aimed to make every fifth vehicle it sold electric by 2025.
The automaker, the world's second biggest after Toyota, will also focus on expanding its presence in North America, where it has struggled for years, and becoming more competitive in China, one of its most important markets, said Oliver Blume, Volkswagen's chief executive.
Mr. Blume laid out a 10-point plan for helping Volkswagen pivot to electric vehicles, a path it began in earnest when it effectively abandoned diesel technology after an emissions cheating scandal in 2015. The plan's centerpiece are investments totaling 180 billion euros, or about $ 193 billion. Two-thirds of that sum will be channeled into producing battery cells, developing software and shoring up supply chains of critical raw materials.
"For me, it is important that we have a clear orientation of where we are going," Mr. Blume told reporters, adding that 2023 would be "a decisive year" for the company. It is his first as chief executive; he took over in September from Herbert Diess, who aggressively pushed Volkswagen to embrace electric cars but was forced out after just four years because of disagreements with the company's board.
Mr. Blume hopes to use some of the proceeds of a 2022 initial public offering of Porsche, where he is also chief executive, to strengthen Volkswagen's electrification strategy. The listing brought in €43 billion.
Volkswagen reported a net profit in 2022 of €15.8 billion, or $ 16.7 billion, an increase of 2.6 percent from the previous year, as supply chains disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic began to normalize.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year caused energy prices to rise and contributed to high inflation, especially in Germany. Addressing those challenges, while balancing the demand for combustion-engine vehicles as the company pivots to electric-vehicle production, will be the main focus in Europe, Volkswagen said.
"We must transform ourselves into a technology and mobility services group," Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen's chief financial and operating officer, said at the Tuesday media event. "We need to focus on our platforms, such as our hardware for battery-powered electric vehicles, a unified software stack, batteries, mobility, autonomous driving."
In the short term, Volkswagen will continue to produce combustion-engine cars, which generate profits that the company needs to pay for the transition to battery-powered vehicles. In 2022, Volkswagen sold 8.2 million cars and trucks.
Despite the German government's call for companies to diversify their operations in Asia, pivoting away from China, Volkswagen is continuing to invest in the country in partnerships with local companies.
Volkswagen is the leading producer of combustion-engine vehicles in China, but has lost ground to domestic carmakers in the fast-growing market for electric cars. Last year, Volkswagen introduced an "in China for China" strategy that it plans to expand, including developing technology and software specifically for consumers there, including in-car karaoke.
The automaker's problems in North America are somewhat different. After years of trying to become a bigger player in the United States specifically, it remains far behind U.S. automakers like General Motors and Ford Motor and Asian companies like Toyota and Hyundai.
Volkswagen retooled its plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., last year to begin producing electric vehicles, and it now produces the ID.4 sport utility vehicle there. On Monday, Volkswagen said it had chosen a site in Ontario for a new battery plant. And earlier in March, the company said it would put up a factory in South Carolina to build pickup trucks and S.U.V.s that would be sold under the moribund Scout brand.
In Europe, a key element of the company's focus includes its first battery cell plant, a €2 billion factory that is rising out of a field in Salzgitter, Germany, near the company's headquarters in Wolfsburg. The new plant sits behind a site where Volkswagen has been building engines for more than 50 years and is slated to become the main provider of battery cells for the automaker.

Jump to: Today's Theme | Tricky Clues
MONDAY PUZZLE -- Congratulations to today's constructor, Lynn Lempel, for publishing her 100th puzzle in the New York Times Crossword! That's an incredible milestone, and this puzzle shows all the polish and precision one would expect from such an expert.
I spoke with The Times's senior puzzle editor, Joel Fagliano, about Ms. Lempel, whom he called "a pro in every aspect of crossword making." "One of Lynn's hallmarks, in my book, is just very to-the-point, interesting and engaging clue writing," Mr. Fagliano said. "This was an easy edit."
He also explained the test-solving process that each puzzle goes through before reaching the public. Each week, five people of different backgrounds and solving skill levels test out our puzzles and give us feedback on things like unfamiliar answers and troublesome crossings.
Let's take a look at Ms. Lempel's brilliant theme and then examine some of the clues that testers flagged as potentially challenging.
Today's Theme
This puzzle features four starred theme entries in the long Across positions, as well as a revealer that explains what the four have in common. That revealer is HUMAN NATURE ("Set of traits we all have ... or a two-part description of the answers to the starred clues?"). Each theme entry is a two-word or compound term, where the first part is a HUMAN body part and the second part is something you might find in NATURE.
The theme entries are FINGER LAKES ("*Region of upstate New York named for its bodies of water"), HEADWIND ("*Navigation hurdle for a sailboat"), FOOTHILLS ("*Climbers' warm-ups before mountains") and PALM TREE ("*Source of shade on a desert island, say").
The New York Times Crossword has featured body part themes before and nature themes before, but combining them, Mr. Fagliano said, made for an "unbelievably tight theme." He added, "It's just really impressive that she even managed to find examples, let alone symmetrical examples." In crossword lingo, a "tight" theme is one that has very few possible theme answers, and most or all are included in the puzzle. "Symmetrical" refers to the length of the theme entries and their placement in opposite positions in the grid, like HEADWIND (eight letters) and PALM TREE (eight letters).
Tricky Clues
Mr. Fagliano shared two comments from the tester panel that were considered in crafting the final puzzle, at 33D and 42D:
33D. Testers flagged the clue "Arm or leg" for LIMB, not because it was difficult but because, with its body part components, it might be confused for a theme clue. Ultimately, the team decided that it wasn't too distracting because it didn't have a "nature" element.
42D. The clue here is "Auto access item" for CAR KEY, but Ms. Lempel's original clue, Mr. Fagliano told me, was "Obsolescent auto security item." Testers said they thought of electronic fobs as keys, too, so "the word 'obsolescent' maybe wasn't accurate." Mr. Fagliano added, "I have a 2006 Toyota Corolla where I do literally have to open the trunk with a key, so it's not obsolescent to me."
21A/8D. I admit that when I initially entered 21A ("Kaitlin of 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"'), I spelled it OLSeN instead of OLSON. I'm not a big tea-drinker, so I wasn't sure whether PEKeE ("Orange ___ (tea type)") was just a type of tea I had never encountered. I had heard of PEKOE, however, so I was able to correct this error.
3D. I also don't know very much about the cider-making business or apple varieties, so I needed all of the crossings to get WINESAP ("Apple used for cider").
57D. Here's a common crossword clue form that asks the solver to identify a time zone. "Summer hrs. in D.C." is the clue for EDT, or Eastern Daylight Time (as opposed to Eastern Standard Time, the hours in D.C. outside of Daylight Saving Time). The abbreviations "hrs." and "D.C." tell the solver that the answer is also an abbreviation.
Constructor Notes
I have stacks and stacks of scribbled theme ideas, a vast majority of which never become puzzles. Most of those sit around for years until, for no particular reason, one of them beckons. Such was the case for my notion of "human nature."
My original thought was things like "mouth of the river," "eye of the storm," "neck of the woods." But I couldn't get a symmetrical set that would work. So I switched gears and ended up with the shortish answers and rather unusual grid you see here.
It seems a majority of the clues were my own, with some of the changes clearly meant to make them easier. Yes, it's Monday.
OMG, I was just reminded that this is my 100th New York Times Crossword. That means a lot of years have flown by! I'm constructing far fewer puzzles these days, but as I've said before, it remains a great alternative to cleaning or shopping or decluttering.

Funds to Bolster U.S. Chip-Making Come With Catch: [National Desk]

Full text: In return for vast subsidies, the Biden administration is asking the chip industry to make promises about its workers and finances.
WASHINGTON -- Semiconductor manufacturers seeking a slice of nearly $ 40 billion in new federal subsidies will need to ensure affordable child care for their workers, limit stock buybacks and share certain excess profits with the government, the Biden administration will announce on Tuesday.
The new requirements represent an aggressive attempt by the federal government to bend the behavior of corporate America to accomplish its economic and national security objectives. As the Biden administration makes the nation's first big foray into industrial policy in decades, officials are also using the opportunity to advance policies championed by liberals that seek to empower workers.
While the moves would advance some of the left-behind portions of the president's agenda, they could also set a fraught precedent for attaching policy strings to federal funding.
Last year, a bipartisan group of lawmakers passed the CHIPS Act, which devoted $ 52 billion to expanding U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and research, in hopes of making the nation less reliant on foreign suppliers for critical chips that power computers, household appliances, cars and more. The prospect of accessing those funds has already enticed domestic and foreign-owned chip makers to announce plans for or begin construction on new projects in Arizona, Texas, Ohio, New York and other states.
On Tuesday, the Commerce Department will release its application for manufacturers seeking funds under the law. It will include a variety of requirements that go far beyond simply encouraging semiconductor production.
For example, the department will tell companies seeking awards of $ 150 million or more to guarantee affordable, high-quality child care for workers who build or operate a plant.
Those projects will also be required to share a portion of any unanticipated profits with the federal government. Companies applying for awards will be required to submit detailed financial projections, with the federal government entitled to share in any "upside" profits. The Commerce Department depicted that requirement as a way to encourage companies to make their projections as accurate as possible, and not exaggerate any losses to try to secure more funding.
Preference will also be given to applicants that promise to refrain from stock buybacks, which tend to enrich shareholders and corporate executives by increasing a company's share price. The law already prohibits companies from directly using federal money to finance stock buybacks or pay dividends.
Gina Raimondo, the Commerce secretary, said in an interview that the financial rules would encourage companies to ask only for funding they really need and prevent them from diverting taxpayer dollars to pad the pockets of their shareholders.
"We don't want to spend a dollar more than necessary to make these projects happen," she said.
The requirements will join a growing list of administration efforts to expand the reach of President Biden's economic policies beyond their primary intent. For instance, administration officials have attached stringent labor standards and "Buy American" provisions to money from a bipartisan infrastructure law.
Companies that receive chip subsidies to build new plants will be able to use some of the funding to meet the new child care requirement. That could include building company child care centers near construction sites or new plants, paying local child care providers to add capacity at an affordable cost for workers, directly subsidizing workers' care costs or other, similar steps that would ensure workers have access to care for their children.
Other provisions of the program will encourage companies, universities and other parties to offer more training for American workers, in advanced sciences but also in fields like welding. The program will encourage colleges and universities to triple their graduation of new engineers over the next decade, Ms. Raimondo said in a speech last week, while also offering high-paying jobs to tens of thousands of American workers without four-year college degrees.
Ms. Raimondo outlined an ambitious vision for investing in the United States to build "a self-propelling engine of innovation and production." The goal of the program, she said, was to create at least two manufacturing clusters for the most cutting-edge chips, as well as factories for older chips. The ultimate aim would be to spur a vibrant semiconductor ecosystem in which every leading global chip company would feel the need to have both research and manufacturing in the United States, she said.
In interviews, Ms. Raimondo said the CHIPS requirements would help companies attract women to fill open jobs at a moment when many companies are struggling with a labor shortage.
Chip makers, Ms. Raimondo said, "will not be successful unless you find a way to attract, train, put to work and retain women, and you won't do that without child care."
The rules for chip makers come on top of other requirements written into the law, including a ban on certain new investments in China. Under that restriction, chip manufacturers that take U.S. funding cannot make new, high-tech investments in China or other "countries of concern" for at least a decade, a prohibition designed to ensure that U.S. taxpayer money does not go toward building operations in China.
But analysts have argued that some of these restrictions may be difficult to uphold, given that money is fungible and can pass from one part of a company to another outside of public sight.
Some Republican and Democratic lawmakers have also questioned the wisdom of giving any taxpayer money to the chip industry, which is generally profitable. Executives have countered that the high cost of operating in the United States -- and subsidies offered by foreign governments -- make it cheaper for semiconductor companies to manufacture their products offshore.
The next few months will provide the first test of how the Commerce Department balances those concerns. Ms. Raimondo said companies would have to open their books to her team, and that the goal would be to try to "crowd in" private investment, rather than canceling it out.
According to the funding application, companies that have secured other sources of private capital will receive "strong preference" for government aid, and applicants will need to have secured some kind of incentive from a state or local government to be eligible for the funding.
Commerce officials will prioritize projects linked to state and local incentive programs that create "spillover benefits" for communities, like investments in work force, education or infrastructure, rather than policies like direct tax abatements that benefit lone companies, it said.
The rules also seek to address rising concerns among American employers, including manufacturers, that a lack of access to affordable child care is blocking millions of Americans from looking for work, particularly women.
Mr. Biden pushed Congress to address those concerns over the past two years, proposing hundreds of billions of dollars for new child care programs, but he was unable to corral support from even a majority of Senate Democrats.
But Mr. Biden did persuade lawmakers to approve an assortment of new spending programs seeking to bolster American manufacturing. Now, the Commerce Department is trying to utilize a centerpiece of those efforts, which aims to expand American semiconductor manufacturing, to make at least a small dent in his large goals for the so-called care economy.
When it became clear last year that sweeping plans to expand and subsidize child care would not make it into the climate, health and tax bill, the culmination of Mr. Biden's economic efforts in Congress, Ms. Raimondo gathered aides around a conference table. She told them, she said, that "if Congress wasn't going to do what they should have done, we're going to do it in implementation" of the bills that did pass.
America's child care industry has not fully rebounded from the pandemic recession. It is still about 58,000 workers, or five percentage points, short of its prepandemic peak, according to an analysis of Labor Department data by the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of California, Berkeley.
Shortly before the pandemic, the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington surveyed 35 states and found more than 11 million children had a potential need for child care -- yet fewer than eight million slots were available.
That shortage is particularly acute in some of the areas where manufacturers are set to begin building new chip plants spurred by the new legislation. Commerce Department officials calculate that in the Syracuse, N.Y., area, where Micron announced a $ 100 billion chip making investment last year after Mr. Biden signed the new law, the need for slots in child care facilities is nearly three times the size of the actual care capacity in the region.
In Phoenix, where semiconductor manufacturing is booming, child care costs consume about 18 percent of a typical construction or manufacturing worker's salary. That share is higher than the national average.
In a speech last week, Ms. Raimondo called efforts to attract more women to the work force "a simple question of math" for industries complaining of labor shortages. "We need chip manufacturers, construction companies and unions to work with us toward the national goal of hiring and training another million women in construction over the next decade to meet the demand not just in chips, but other industries and infrastructure projects as well," she said.
Only about three in 10 U.S. manufacturing workers are women. Ms. Raimondo said the CHIPS Act would fail if the administration did not help companies change those numbers, by bringing in women who have children.
Some American manufacturers have already turned to on-site care facilities to help meet workers' needs. The automaker Toyota has provided 24-hour care at a factory in Kentucky since 1993 and one in Indiana since 2004.
Chad Moutray, the director of the Center for Manufacturing Research at the Manufacturing Institute, which is affiliated with the National Association of Manufacturers, wrote in a report late last year that child care availability is part of the reason women do not seek more jobs in manufacturing.
"Women represent a sizable talent pool that manufacturers cannot ignore," he wrote.

DeSantis Takes Over Zone
Of Disney as Punishment
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday signed a bill that gives him control of Walt Disney World's self-governing district, punishing the company over its opposition to the so-called "Don't Say Gay" law.
The bill requires Mr. DeSantis, a Republican, to appoint a five-member board to oversee the government services that the Disney district provides in its sprawling theme park properties in Florida.
"Today the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end," he said at a bill signing ceremony in Lake Buena Vista. "There's a new sheriff in town, and accountability will be the order of the day."
The signing came as Mr. DeSantis gears up for an expected presidential run and marks a high-profile legislative victory for a governor whose leveraging of cultural and political divides has elevated him in Republican politics.

Nissan Accelerates Shift To Electric Vehicles
Nissan is speeding up its shift toward electric vehicles, especially in Europe where emissions regulations are most stringent, the company said Monday.
Nissan said in a statement that it will make practically all its offerings in Europe electric or series-hybrids by fiscal 2026, at 98 percent. That's up from the previous target of 75 percent. In Japan, the company aims to make 58 percent of its model offerings, up from an earlier target of 55 percent.
Hybrids have both a gasoline engine and electric motor, but a series hybrid uses the motor to power the vehicle's wheels, or powertrain. The engine powers a generator for the motor. Parallel hybrids, like Toyota's Prius, switch back and forth between a gas engine and electric motor.
Nissan's sales target in E.V.s and series hybrids remain unchanged for the U.S., at more than 40 percent. In China the target was cut to 35 percent from 40 percent. That includes only pure E.V.s, not hybrids.

E.U. Official Defends Talks On Funding Tech Upgrades
Europe's existing telecom networks aren't up to the job of handling surging amounts of internet data traffic, a top E.U. official said Monday, as he defended a consultation on whether Big Tech should help pay for upgrades.
The telecom industry needs to reconsider its business models as it undergoes a "radical shift" fueled by a new wave of innovation such as immersive, data-hungry technologies like the metaverse, Thierry Breton, the European Commission's official in charge of digital policy, said at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
Mr. Breton's remarks came days after he announced a consultation on whether digital giants should help contribute to the billions needed to build the 27-nation bloc's future communications infrastructure, including next-generation 5G wireless.
"Yes, of course, we will need to find a financing model for the huge investments needed," Mr. Breton said. ASSOCIATED PRESS

WASHINGTON — Semiconductor manufacturers seeking a slice of nearly $40 billion in new federal subsidies will need to ensure affordable child care for their workers, limit stock buybacks and share certain excess profits with the government, the Biden administration will announce on Tuesday.
The new requirements represent an aggressive attempt by the federal government to bend the behavior of corporate America to accomplish its economic and national security objectives. As the Biden administration makes the nation’s first big foray into industrial policy in decades, officials are also using the opportunity to advance policies championed by liberals that seek to empower workers.
While the moves would advance some of the left-behind portions of the president’s agenda, they could also set a fraught precedent for attaching policy strings to federal funding.
Last year, a bipartisan group of lawmakers passed the CHIPS Act, which devoted $52 billion to expanding U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and research, in hopes of making the nation less reliant on foreign suppliers for crucial chips that power computers, household appliances, cars and more. The prospect of accessing those funds has enticed domestic and foreign-owned chipmakers to announce plans for or begin construction on new projects in Arizona, Texas, Ohio, New York and other states.
On Tuesday, the Commerce Department will release its application for manufacturers seeking funds under the law. It will include a variety of requirements that go far beyond simply encouraging semiconductor production.
For example, the department will tell companies seeking awards of $150 million or more to guarantee affordable, high-quality child care for workers who build or operate a plant.
Those projects will also be required to share a portion of any unanticipated profits with the federal government. Companies applying for awards will be required to submit detailed financial projections, with the federal government entitled to share in any “upside” profits. The Commerce Department depicted that requirement as a way to encourage companies to make their projections as accurate as possible, and not exaggerate any losses to try to secure more funding.
Preference will also be given to applicants that promise to refrain from stock buybacks, which tend to enrich shareholders and corporate executives by increasing a company’s share price. The law already prohibits companies from directly using federal money to finance stock buybacks or pay dividends.

To Tap Federal Funds, Chipmakers Will Need to Provide Child Care

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration plans to leverage the federal government’s expansive investment in the semiconductor industry to make progress on another goal: affordable child care.
On Tuesday, the Commerce Department will announce that any semiconductor manufacturer seeking a slice of nearly $40 billion in new federal subsidies will need to essentially guarantee affordable, high-quality child care for workers who build or operate a plant.
Last year, a bipartisan group of lawmakers passed the CHIPS Act, which devoted $39 billion to directly boost U.S. semiconductor factories as part of $52 billion in subsidies for the industry, in hopes of making the nation less reliant on foreign suppliers for critical chips that power computers, video games, cars and more.
Companies that receive the subsidies to build new plants will be able to use some of the government money to meet the new child care requirement. They could do that in a number of ways, in consultation with Commerce officials who will set basic guidelines but not dictate how companies ensure workers have access to care they can afford.
That could include building company child care centers near construction sites or new plants, paying local child care providers to add capacity at an affordable cost for workers, directly subsidizing workers’ care costs or other, similar steps that would ensure workers have access to care for their children.
U.S. employers, including manufacturers, are increasingly raising concerns that a lack of access to affordable child care is blocking millions of Americans from looking for work, particularly women. President Joe Biden pushed Congress to address those concerns over the past two years, proposing hundreds of billions of dollars for new child care programs, but he was unable to corral support from even a majority of Senate Democrats.
But Biden did convince lawmakers to approve a range of new spending programs seeking to boost U.S. manufacturing. Now, Commerce is trying to utilize a centerpiece of those efforts, which aims to expand U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, to make at least a small dent in his large goals for the so-called care economy.
It joins a growing list of administration efforts to expand the reach of Biden’s economic policies beyond their primary intent. For instance, administration officials have attached stringent labor standards and “Buy America” provisions to money from a bipartisan infrastructure law. The child care requirement will be flexible for chipmakers, but it will almost certainly divert some subsidy dollars that are meant to expand factory capacity and create jobs.
The Commerce Department is expected to release its application Tuesday, allowing companies to begin making a case for federal subsidies that the industry lobbied hard to secure from Congress.
The prospect of accessing those funds has already enticed domestic and foreign-owned chipmakers to announce billions of dollars in plans for new investments in Arizona, central New York and elsewhere.
But even as they ramp up investments, companies are complaining of difficulties in finding workers to build and operate manufacturing facilities.
The United States’ child care industry has not fully rebounded from the pandemic recession. It is still about 58,000 workers, or 5 percentage points, short of its pre-pandemic peak, according to an analysis of Labor Department data by the Center for the Study of Childcare Employment at the University of California-Berkeley.
Shortly before the pandemic, the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington surveyed 35 states and found more than 11 million children had a potential need for child care — yet fewer than 8 million slots were available.
That shortage is particularly acute in some of the areas where manufacturers are set to begin building new chip plants spurred by the new legislation. Commerce Department officials calculate that in the Syracuse, New York, area, where Micron announced a $100 billion chipmaking investment last year after Biden signed the new law, the need for slots in child care facilities is nearly three times the size of the actual care capacity in the region.
In Phoenix, where semiconductor manufacturing is booming, child care costs consume about 18% of a typical construction or manufacturing worker’s salary. That share is higher than the national average.
Gina Raimondo, the Commerce secretary, said in an interview that the child care requirements should help companies cope with a tight labor market by making it easier for them to attract and retain caregivers who have been kept from working by difficulties finding care for their children.
In a speech last week, Raimondo called efforts to attract more women to the workforce “a simple question of math” for industries complaining of labor shortages. “We need chip manufacturers, construction companies and unions to work with us toward the national goal of hiring and training another million women in construction over the next decade to meet the demand not just in chips, but other industries and infrastructure projects as well,” she said.
Only about 3 in 10 U.S. manufacturing workers are women. Raimondo said the CHIPS Act would fail if the administration did not help companies change those numbers, by bringing in women who have children.
“You will not be successful unless you find a way to attract, train, put to work and retain women, and you won’t do that without child care,” Raimondo said in an interview.
The Commerce requirement would represent a relatively small step toward Biden’s much larger, and as-yet unfulfilled, child care ambitions.
Biden unveiled a $4 trillion economic agenda in the months after he took office. It was split into two parts. One focused on physical investments: repairing bridges and water pipes, laying broadband cable, spurring a shift to low-emission sources of energy and catalyzing new manufacturing capacity to compete on a global stage. It was a source of repeated legislative success for the president, who signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill, the CHIPS bill and a climate, health and tax bill that passed with only Democratic votes.
But Biden failed to persuade centrist holdouts in his party, like Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, to back most of the provisions in the second half of his agenda. Those were largely the president’s plans to invest in people: federally guaranteed paid leave; subsidized care for children, the disabled and older Americans; universal prekindergarten; free community college for all, and more.
The lopsided nature of Biden’s success threatens to exacerbate existing gender disparities in the economy. Some economists warn they could hinder future economic growth. Many of Biden’s people-focused programs were deliberately aimed at boosting female participation in the workforce.
It could be years before Democrats have another opportunity to pass those programs. Republicans won control of the House of Representatives last fall and roundly oppose Biden on new spending proposals and the tax increases on corporations and high earners that he has called for to cover that spending. Progressive groups and liberal lawmakers largely concede there is little chance of a child care bill making its way to Biden’s desk before the 2024 election.
When it became clear last year that sweeping plans to expand and subsidize child care would not make it into the climate, health and tax bill that marked the culmination of Biden’s economic efforts in Congress, Raimondo gathered aides around a conference table. She told them, she said, that “if Congress wasn’t going to do what they should have done, we’re going to do it in implementation” of the bills that did pass.
Some U.S. manufacturers have already turned to on-site care facilities to help meet workers needs. Automaker Toyota has provided 24-hour care at a factory in Kentucky since 1993 and one in Indiana since 2004.

Full text: Thirty years ago today, Tim Lang was injured in the first attack on the twin towers, an ominous but often overlooked prelude to 9/11. He does not forget.
Thirty years ago today, terrorists left a bomb weighing more than a half-ton in a rented van parked beneath the World Trade Center, a workplace for tens of thousands. Its smoldering fuse took about 12 minutes to close the gap between the everyday and the horrific.
The lunchtime blast left a crater several stories deep, sent acrid smoke up the center's north tower and killed six people. More than 1,000 others were injured that day, including a dark-haired trader just yards from the underground detonation.
Eight years later, that same man, Tim Lang, fled Lower Manhattan as terrorists struck the World Trade Center again, this time with jetliners. He saw the first of its two towers buckle and fall in an attack that killed nearly 3,000 people, including those dear to him.
Mr. Lang is 69 now, with shock-white hair and photos of grandchildren stored in his smartphone. He describes himself as an unremarkable man. Yet he is also an everyman through-line between two remarkable events: the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which upended world politics, and the bombing of Feb. 26, 1993, which is less indelibly burned into collective memory but stands as ominous prelude.
"Just about everybody forgets about it," he said.
Not Mr. Lang. He continues to process what happened -- while working to push against feelings of hate that might consume him as easily as the burning hole left by the bomb. "There's a saying," he said. "Resentment is like taking poison and hoping the other person dies."
Still, that February Friday and that September Tuesday have become part of him. He dreads the anniversaries.
"In the days leading up to it, I don't sleep," Mr. Lang said. "And that's already begun. February's here. So I have trouble."
In the winter of 1993, Mr. Lang was succeeding on Wall Street and foundering in nearly everything else. He was the about-to-be-divorced father of two boys and two girls, alienated from devout Roman Catholic parents who believed in the sanctity of marriage. Now Tim, the fourth of the dozen children they had raised in working-class Brooklyn, was living alone and feeling alone.
He hadn't wanted to go into the city that day, but his partner insisted he was needed at a 12:30 meeting. A reluctant Mr. Lang left his New Jersey condo and drove his Toyota 4Runner through the cold, late-morning gray.
As he headed down a ramp into the World Trade Center's underground garage, a zooming Ford Taurus cut ahead of him. After a brief wait, the two vehicles entered the garage, the Ford making a right and the Toyota turning left.
If Mr. Lang saw the Ryder van parked on the same level, he took no notice. He pulled his S.U.V. beside a concrete wall, got out and opened a back-seat door to collect his coat and some documents. Then came a crack like a lightning strike.
He felt his entire body compress as he was lifted and thrown. His head hit something, and he was out.
Mr. Lang awoke to blackness, thick smoke burning his throat and dozens of car alarms bleating in his ear. He checked his legs and arms and felt a sticky wetness at the back of his head. His inability to see had him briefly thinking, of all things, that he was now the second blind bagpiper in his pipe band.
Thoughts like these jumbled in his mind. Had the car beside him exploded? Was this mob-related? What about that page from a calendar of biblical sayings he had stuck in his wallet that morning? Genesis: Do not be afraid.
Coughing and too dizzy to stand, Mr. Lang crawled through the jagged debris to a distant light -- he could see! -- coming from what turned out to be his Toyota. He climbed inside to drive away, only to realize it was crumpled.
Low to the ground and with his sweater pulled up over his nose, he tried to find an exit. Familiar with the garage's layout, he made his way toward the destroyed manager's office to find a phone, fell on a dead body, then crawled to the edge of the smoldering chasm created by the explosion.
"So if things were bad where I was before, this pit is spewing out stuff from the bottom of hell," Mr. Lang recently recalled on "Operation Tradebom," a podcast about the bombing.
He crawled away, lay down by a car, prayed for his children and for the courage to die. A calm began to settle over him. Then a bang sounded in the distance.
"And I screamed out," he said.
Someone hearing his cries alerted two members of the New York Police Department's Emergency Services Unit who arrived early to the scene: Detective Edward Joergens and Officer Cory Cuneo. Wearing air packs and using a fire hose spooled near a door as a tether, they inched through the consuming darkness.
"We carried these huge flashlights, and still you couldn't see six inches in front of you," Mr. Cuneo recalled.
Their lifeline of a fire hose ran out, but sporadic calls for help beckoned above the car-alarm cacophony. They pushed on.
Minutes later, a rescuer's boot illuminated by a flashlight appeared before Mr. Lang, and he grabbed it. Finally: connection.
The hope that he might survive competed with the fear that he couldn't breathe -- and what he was breathing was toxic. He clutched Mr. Cuneo's hand.
"I would not let go of his hand," Mr. Lang recalled. "I was shaking and crying and would never let go of his hand."
With two supporting one, the men stumbled and banged their way through the murk. Finally, they reached a stairwell, and daylight and Liberty Street, where the soot-covered man in shock was gently lowered to the sidewalk.
After several hours in the hospital, Mr. Lang returned to his isolation along the Jersey Shore. "It was the darkest time of my life," he said. "Now, I can look back and say, you know, the Lord can nudge you along, or he could have you blown up to make it right."
Mr. Lang would sit at water's edge, grateful to be alive -- glad just for the coffee in his hand -- but grieving, too, for the loss of other lives, for the state of things, for his own state. He thought about that line from Genesis and about that driver of the Taurus who had cut him off, turned right and was killed. Sometimes he cried.
"Whatever my priorities were, they changed when I came out," he said. "Like so many balls thrown up in the air and landing in a different order."
It took time to understand the new order. He found a therapist. He committed himself more deeply to his faith. He reconciled with his parents and siblings. He remarried and became the father of two more girls.
He also did a lot of reading about radical Islam. "Who are these people?" Mr. Lang said he wanted to know. "And why did they try to kill me?"
He learned that the mastermind of the bombing, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, had been disappointed with its death toll and had hoped that the north tower would topple into the south tower.
"I always knew they'd be back," Mr. Lang said.
Mr. Yousef, who fled the United States hours after the bombing, would team up with his maternal uncle, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who had sent money by wire transfer to one of Mr. Yousef's co-conspirators. Plots of terror continued.
Mr. Yousef was captured in 1995 and eventually convicted in the trade center bombing and a subsequent plot to down several American airplanes. He is serving life without parole in a federal "supermax" penitentiary in Colorado.
But his uncle continued to elude capture. And on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Lang and his brother Richard were walking into their Lower Manhattan building when someone said a plane had hit the World Trade Center's north tower. Hustling out to Rector Street, they saw the point of impact and the ensuing fire -- just below where their sister Rosanne worked as an equities trader.
The brothers raced up to their high-rise office and tried telephoning her. No answer. They then heard a tremendous ground-rattling sound and looked out to see the second jetliner fly past and into the south tower.
Fearing more attacks, the Lang brothers made it to Pier 11 at the eastern end of Wall Street and boarded one of the first ferries evacuating people to New Jersey. As the vessel pulled away, they saw the south tower fall.
"We have to pray," Mr. Lang recalled saying.
The men did not yet know that their nephew Brendan, 30, a project manager for a construction company, was among those killed in the south tower's collapse. And as their ferry approached the dock in Highlands some 40 minutes later, the captain announced that the north tower had fallen as well.
Four of the Lang brothers -- Tim, Richard, Donald and Marty, a just-retired New York firefighter -- headed out the next day to Lower Manhattan, hoping to find their loved ones alive. But they knew.
Rosanne Lang, 42, was the divorced mother of a teenage son. A glimpse of her effect on others came when Mr. Lang and a brother went to collect her Mercedes at her usual parking lot in Jersey City. He pointed out the car and the attendant burst into tears.
Federal authorities have identified Mr. Yousef's uncle, Mr. Mohammed, as the principal architect of the Sept. 11 attacks. Captured in 2003, he has been held since 2006 at a military prison in Guantánamo Bay, where efforts to prosecute him have been delayed by a host of complications, including his torture at the hands of the C.I.A.
In 2019, Mr. Lang was part of a group invited by the federal government to observe proceedings at Guantánamo Bay. Seeing Mr. Mohammed up close, in custody, he felt no hate, he says -- only a deep sadness over lost lives, wasted lives and belief systems that allow for the killing of innocent people in retaliation.
"There's a complexity to other people's lives that is beyond my own understanding," he said.
These days, Mr. Lang runs an equity trading firm, Global Liquidity Partners, from an office near his home in Monmouth Beach. He golfs, attends a men's prayer group, plays the bagpipes, marches in parades and enjoys the company of his seven grandchildren, all boys.
The years come and go, as do anniversaries.
A few days ago, on Ash Wednesday, Mr. Lang went to a Catholic church and received the gray smudge on his forehead to remind him of, among other things, his mortality. Two other days on his calendar do the same.

Beneath a Car's Chassis Lies a Thief's Treasure: [Metropolitan]

Full text: In New York City, thefts of catalytic converters, known as 'cats,' rose by nearly 5,000 in one year.
In December of 2021, David Aujero walked out of his home in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, got into his 2002 Honda Element, and turned on the ignition. The sound that came from his car was a rumbling roar, as if someone had swapped his engine with that of a dump truck. "I thought maybe the car had to warm up a little, but the sound was really loud," said Mr. Aujero, a video director for technology brands.
When he took his Honda to the repair shop, the mechanic knew what was wrong before Mr. Aujero stepped out of his car: His catalytic converter had been stolen. "It was the fourth case my mechanic had seen that week," he said.
Catalytic converters, or "cats" for short, are valuable because they contain precious metals that can be extracted and resold for up to $ 50 per gram. Nationwide, thefts of the device increased by well over 1,000 percent in 2019, according to a report from the National Insurance Crime Bureau.
In New York City, reported thefts jumped from 2,070 to 7,000 between 2021 and 2022, according to a New York Police Department spokesman. The incidents were equally distributed throughout the city, with the highest overall numbers recorded in the Bronx, Queens, and south Brooklyn. Just this week, police officers interrupted a theft in progress -- the person apprehended was using a large power saw -- in Washington Heights.
Kevin Wright, a mechanic in Midtown, who said the problem had not been this bad in 20 years, blamed the pandemic. John Mouras, another mechanic in Greenpoint, agreed. "I figure it's a lot of people not having work and trying to find a way to survive financially," he said. But there is also evidence that the robberies have ties to organized crime. In November of last year, the Justice Department busted a nationwide ring of "thieves, dealers, and processors," seizing $ 545 million in assets from 21 people, including two men from Long Island.
The device, which looks like a metal hot water bottle, is found in the car's underbody and is part of its exhaust system. It has been standard in nearly every vehicle manufactured since 1975 because of the Clean Air Act. It converts harmful emissions like carbon monoxide into safe ones like steam through the use of a chemical catalyst (hence the name).
The magic ingredients of that chemical catalyst are the precious metals rhodium, palladium and platinum; the latter two cost between $ 30 and $ 50 per gram. Each converter contains several grams of each metal and can fetch as much as $ 1,000 at unscrupulous scrap yards. The converters can be clipped off a car with a battery-powered saw in minutes, and thieves can pick off entire rows of vehicles in under an hour.
Mimi Pak had her converter clipped from her 2012 Toyota Prius in the summer of 2022. She had driven to Astoria, Queens, from her home in New Jersey to visit a friend, parking on a quiet residential street for just a few hours. But when she came back and started up her car, a sudden, off-putting roar came from the tailpipe. "It sounded like a Harley Davidson revving right outside my window," said Ms. Pak, a teacher. "I waited for it to pass me on the street but realized that the sound was coming from my car."
Ms. Pak took her vehicle to a Toyota dealership to have the part replaced last August, but she was told it would be months until the part was available. Catalytic converters on hybrid cars are especially attractive to thieves, as their reduced emissions mean less wear on the palladium and platinum catalysts.
Global supply chain issues surrounding the precious metals have been an issue since the onset of the pandemic, and now there are concerns, stemming from the Russia-Ukraine War, that Russia, which supplies 40 percent of the world's palladium, according to Moody's analytics, could pull its supply off the market. "My converter got stolen in August, and I just got my car back in January," Ms. Pak said.

NEW YORK — In December of 2021, David Aujero walked out of his home in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, got into his 2002 Honda Element and turned on the ignition. The sound that came from his car was a rumbling roar, as if someone had swapped his engine with that of a dump truck. “I thought maybe the car had to warm up a little, but the sound was really loud,” said Aujero, a video director for technology brands.
When he took his Honda to the repair shop, the mechanic knew what was wrong before Aujero stepped out of his car: His catalytic converter had been stolen. “It was the fourth case my mechanic had seen that week,” he said.
Catalytic converters, or “cats” for short, are valuable because they contain precious metals that can be extracted and resold for up to $50 per gram. Nationwide, thefts of the device increased by well over 1,000% in 2019, according to a report from the National Insurance Crime Bureau.
In New York City, reported thefts jumped from 2,070 to 7,000 between 2021 and 2022, according to a New York Police Department spokesperson. The incidents were equally distributed throughout the city, with the highest overall numbers recorded in the Bronx, Queens, and south Brooklyn. Just this week, police officers interrupted a theft in progress — the person apprehended was using a large power saw — in Washington Heights.
Kevin Wright, a mechanic in midtown who said the problem had not been this bad in 20 years, blamed the pandemic. John Mouras, another mechanic in Greenpoint, agreed. “I figure it’s a lot of people not having work and trying to find a way to survive financially,” he said. But there is also evidence that the robberies have ties to organized crime. In November of last year, the Justice Department busted a nationwide ring of “thieves, dealers, and processors,” seizing $545 million in assets from 21 people, including two men from Long Island.
The device, which looks like a metal hot water bottle, is found in the car’s underbody and is part of its exhaust system. It has been standard in nearly every vehicle manufactured since 1975 because of the Clean Air Act. It converts harmful emissions like carbon monoxide into safe ones like steam through the use of a chemical catalyst (hence the name).
The magic ingredients of that chemical catalyst are the precious metals rhodium, palladium and platinum; the latter two cost between $30 and $50 per gram. Each converter contains several grams of each metal and can fetch as much as $1,000 at unscrupulous scrap yards. The converters can be clipped off a car with a battery-powered saw in minutes, and thieves can pick off entire rows of vehicles in under an hour.
Mimi Pak had her converter clipped from her 2012 Toyota Prius in the summer of 2022. She had driven to Astoria, Queens, from her home in New Jersey to visit a friend, parking on a quiet residential street for just a few hours. But when she came back and started up her car, a sudden, off-putting roar came from the tailpipe. “It sounded like a Harley Davidson revving right outside my window,” said Pak, a teacher. “I waited for it to pass me on the street but realized that the sound was coming from my car.”
Pak took her vehicle to a Toyota dealership to have the part replaced last August, but she was told it would be months until the part was available. Catalytic converters on hybrid cars are especially attractive to thieves, as their reduced emissions mean less wear on the palladium and platinum catalysts.
Global supply chain issues surrounding the precious metals have been an issue since the onset of the pandemic, and now there are concerns, stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war, that Russia, which supplies 40% of the world’s palladium, according to Moody’s analytics, could pull its supply off the market. “My converter got stolen in August, and I just got my car back in January,” Pak said.
As a preventive measure, the New York Police Department has created a system in which car owners can etch a serial code into their catalytic converters and enter it into an online database. Still, that hasn’t made thieves any less brazen. In 2021, Dan Segal and Lana Samad were preparing to drive across the country in a 1999 RV when their catalytic converter was stolen outside an auto body shop in the Bronx the night before they were scheduled to leave.
“We came back in the morning to pick up the RV, and our mechanic was panicked. They had caught the whole thing on video,” said Segal, a management consultant who now lives in Oakland, California. “It was just one guy with an electric saw at 4 a.m. who was in and out in less than a minute.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Shoichiro Toyoda, Who Helped Turn Toyota Into a Global Force, Dies at 97: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He pushed the company into North America and beyond, setting it on its path to becoming one of the world's most powerful automakers.
TOKYO -- Shoichiro Toyoda, the chief of the automotive giant Toyota, who led the company as it expanded production into North America in the 1980s and helped transform it into a global brand, died on Tuesday. The son of the company's founder, he was 97.
Toyota said in a statement that the cause was heart failure. It did not say where he had died.
In a decade at Toyota's helm, Mr. Toyoda marshaled his considerable skills in engineering, management, politics and diplomacy to put the company on the path to passing General Motors as the world's largest automaker.
The accomplishment was all the more impressive because he took charge of Toyota at the height of U.S.-Japan trade tensions, in 1982, when Japanese cars had become a powerful symbol of American fears of a rising Japan replacing the United States as the world's largest economic power.
Despite those tensions, Mr. Toyoda expanded his company's production into North America, first forming an alliance with General Motors in 1984 before opening the company's first American plant, in Kentucky, in 1988, yielding to American pressure to produce cars in the United States.
By the end of his tenure, he had expanded production globally, making the company truly international.
Mr. Toyoda took a pragmatic approach to relations between the United States and Japan -- then the world's first and second largest economies -- arguing that as Japan rose, it needed to work harder to ingratiate itself with its competitors, a message that he made part of Toyota's corporate philosophy.
After stepping down as Toyota's chief executive, in 1994, he became the head of Japan's most powerful business lobby, where he helped shape the country's efforts to fight the economic stagnation that began in the early 1990s.
Shoichiro Toyoda was born on Feb. 27, 1925, in Nagoya, an industrial port city in central Japan, the second of four children of Kiichiro and Hatako Toyoda. He enjoyed a privileged childhood: In a 2014 column for the newspaper Nikkei Shimbun, he recounted how his elementary school classmates had teased him when he revealed that he breakfasted with his family's "maidservant."
His father founded Toyota Motor in 1937, spinning it off from an automatic loom manufacturer started by his father, Sakichi. The "d" in Toyoda was changed to a "t" in the company name because it was thought that it looked better when written in Japanese.
During World War II, Mr. Toyoda began studies at Nagoya University. He was passed over for the military draft because his major, engineering, was considered vital for the war effort, he wrote in the Nikkei article. When the war ended, he enrolled in a graduate program in Tohoku University and later received a doctorate from Nagoya University.
In 1950, a debt-racked Toyota split into two companies, one for manufacturing, which Kiichiro Toyoda ran, and the other for sales. Faced with a festering labor dispute, Kiichiro Toyoda was forced to resign, temporarily ending the family's leadership of the company. He died soon after.
Shoichiro Toyoda joined the company at 27 as director of the inspection department. Early in his career he played a key role in Toyota's first foray into the United States, signing off in 1957 on the export of the company's Crown model after taking it on an American road trip, which included a cheeky stop in front of Ford's headquarters in Detroit.
But American drivers rejected the car, complaining of its weak engine. The failure made Mr. Toyoda "determined to develop a high-quality passenger car that would perform well anywhere in the world," he wrote in the Nikkei in 2014.
Despite the flub, he quickly rose in the company's ranks, partly because of his talent for engineering and business and partly because of his family's continued influence over the business. By 1982, when the two halves of the company reunited, he was at the top.
It was a period of both great promise and risk for the company. Japan had surpassed the U.S. as the world's largest automaker, and with inflation, unemployment and protectionist sentiment running high in America, Tokyo and Washington agreed on the first of many rounds of import restrictions on Japanese automobiles.
While Nissan and Honda established American factories, Mr. Toyoda led the company into a deal with General Motors, intended to help the company increase its American sales. In an interview with The New York Times, one company executive said the move was like offering "salt to our enemy," a reference to Japan's feudal period, when warlords would sometimes feed people in enemy territory. Car and Driver magazine ran the headline "Hell Freezes Over." The partnership ended soon after General Motors declared bankruptcy in 2009.
Even as he competed with American companies, Mr. Toyoda pushed for Japanese companies to play a bigger role in the communities where they built their factories. In a 1990 speech, he encouraged Japanese industrialists to "contribute on the same level as Americans" by becoming active in local charitable organizations in the United States. (The Japanese government gave tax breaks to those that did.)
As Americans became enamored of Toyota's ultraefficient production practices, Mr. Toyoda started a management training center to help U.S. businesses. And he helped keep trade tensions down through concessions to Washington.
By 1992, when he stepped down as president to become the company's chairman, Toyota had plants in 22 countries and was competing with its former partner, General Motors, for the title of the world's largest automaker. It won that battle in 2008.
In 1994, as Japan's meteoric economic rise suddenly turned into a period of stagnation, Mr. Toyoda was appointed head of the business lobbying group Keidanren, where he spent four years pushing the country to reduce the many regulations that he believed hindered its growth.
He stepped down as Toyota's chairman in 1999 and became honorary chairman for life, a position from which he continued to influence the company's course. He was inducted into the U.S. Automotive Hall of Fame in 2007.
He is survived by his wife, Hiroko, whom he married in 1952; a son, Akio; and a daughter, Atsuko.
Reflecting on his career in the 2014 article, Mr. Toyoda wrote, "I have worked single-mindedly to add at least a few new lines to the auto industry history books."

Tesla Workers at a Factory in Buffalo Begin a Campaign to Form a Union: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: If successful, the workers who help develop Tesla's Autopilot driver-assistance system will be the first group at the company to organize.
A group of workers at a Tesla factory in Buffalo began a campaign on Tuesday to form a union, saying they want better pay and benefits. If successful, the effort could establish the first union at the fast-growing auto and energy company, which has fiercely resisted efforts to organize its employees.
The factory in Buffalo makes solar panels and components for charging equipment, according to Tesla's website, and also has about 800 workers who help develop driver-assistance software for cars. The software workers initiated the union drive, and went public Tuesday in an effort to win broader support at the site.
Tesla pays workers in Buffalo less than national averages and they receive little sick time, workers involved in the drive said. "We are only asking for a seat in the car that we helped build," Keenan Lasch, a member of a group calling itself Tesla Workers United, said in a statement.
The employees are working with Workers United, which is affiliated with the Service Employees International Union. The union campaign was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.
Attempts to organize Tesla workers have so far failed. Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, has been openly hostile to unions. In 2021, the National Labor Relations Board found that Tesla had illegally fired a worker involved in organizing at the company's car factory in Fremont, Calif., and that Mr. Musk had illegally threatened workers with the loss of stock options if they unionized.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
The company's nonunion workplaces potentially give the company a cost advantage over established automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, whose employees are represented by the United Auto Workers in the United States. Unionized workers generally receive better pay and benefits than workers who are not represented.
The U.A.W. has so far been frustrated in its attempts to expand beyond the Michigan automakers. In recent years, attempts to organize workers for foreign automakers with factories in the South, including Nissan, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, have failed.
Tesla is the latest big technology company to be the target of labor organizers. Amazon workers at a warehouse on Staten Island voted in April to unionize, but workers at an Amazon facility in Albany, N.Y., voted in October against union representation.
The drive in Buffalo has the support of Jaz Brisack, who gained national prominence for her efforts to organize Starbucks workers in Buffalo.
"So incredibly glad to be working with the Tesla workers on their campaign!" Ms. Brisack said on Twitter on Tuesday.
The Autopilot workers in Buffalo analyze data collected by cars to improve the software, which has been blamed for numerous crashes, some fatal. Federal officials have asked Tesla for documents related to the self-driving software, the company disclosed last month.
Tesla has openings for jobs in Buffalo that entail labeling images and videos collected from cars. No experience in artificial intelligence or data labeling is required, according to two job postings on its website.
Workers said they were committed to Tesla's mission but wanted a greater voice. In an open letter to fellow workers, they said they wanted to form a union that would "be as innovative as the company we work for and to build an even more collaborative environment that will strengthen the company."
"As much as I love my job, it can feel very disheartening living paycheck to paycheck when I work for one of the most successful companies in the world," Zahra Lahrache, who has worked at Tesla in Buffalo for five months, said in a statement issued by the workers, "and that is why I am exercising my right to unionize."

U.S. Loans $ 2 Billion
To Support Battery Effort
The Energy Department on Thursday announced a $ 2 billion loan to help a Nevada company step up production of critical components of electric vehicle batteries.
The company, Redwood Materials, plans to use the loan to expand a manufacturing campus near Reno, Nev., where it makes some of the components from new and recycled sources. The company was founded by J.B. Straubel, a former top Tesla executive, and has partnerships with Panasonic, Ford Motor, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo.
After construction is complete, Redwood aims to produce enough battery materials at the Nevada campus to support production of more than one million electric vehicles a year. The loan will help to create about 3,400 construction jobs, Redwood and the Energy Department said. The company said it expected about 1,600 full-time employees to work at the campus when it was finished.
The announcement was the latest loan from the department to support domestic battery manufacturing as the Biden administration seeks to bring more of the supply chain for electric vehicles to the United States and reduce reliance on China. Last month, the department said it would lend $ 700 million to support a mining project in Nevada. In December, the department announced a $ 2.5 billion loan for Ultium Cells, a battery-making joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution. NIRAJ CHOKSHI
RIDE HAILING
Lyft Blames Bad Weather
For Bleak Revenue Forecast
Lyft on Thursday forecast current-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates, blaming extremely cold weather in some of its major markets and lower prices, especially during peak hours, sending its shares down 23 percent in extended trading.
The company's outlook was in contrast to that of its larger rival, Uber, whose strong presence globally is helping it ride a boom in demand for ride-hailing services from travelers and officegoers
Lyft's bigger presence on the West Coast, a region that analysts have said was trailing the rest of the United States in return to pre-Covid demand, could be hurting its recovery compared with Uber's.
Lyft forecast first-quarter revenue of about $ 975 million, which fell below analyst estimates of $ 1.09 billion, according to Refinitiv data. REUTERS
FAST FOOD
Chick-fil-A Will Test
Plant-Based Sandwich
Chick-fil-A said Thursday that it's testing its first plant-based entrée -- a breaded cauliflower sandwich -- at restaurants in Denver; Charleston, S.C.; and the Greensboro, N.C., area. The test begins Monday.
The Atlanta-based company said its culinary team spent four years developing the sandwich after guests told the chain they wanted to add more vegetables to their diets. Chick-fil-A tested mushrooms, chickpeas and chopped vegetables formed into patties but kept returning to cauliflower for its mild flavor.
Like Chick-fil-A's signature chicken sandwich, the cauliflower steak is marinated, breaded, pressure-cooked and then served on a bun with two pickle slices.
Chick-fil-A is a relative latecomer to the plant-based fast food scene. Burger King started selling its Impossible Whopper -- featuring a plant-based burger made by Impossible Foods -- in 2019. Starbucks launched an Impossible sausage sandwich in 2020. McDonald's debuted its McPlant burger -- developed with Beyond Meat -- in the United Kingdom in 2021. And KFC began selling Beyond Meat nuggets last year. ASSOCIATED PRESS

In South Sudan, Pope Recounts Troubles of Young, Fractured Nation: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It is just over a decade since the steamy capital of South Sudan exploded in joy, with revelers singing and dancing through the night to mark the birth of their nation as it split from its old enemy, Sudan.
The new country was cheered on in 2011 by the American diplomats who had midwifed its delivery and the Hollywood celebrities who championed its cause. Billions of dollars poured into an ambitious state-building project that offered a fresh start to a people weary after decades of war. "Freedom!" they cried.
Now that feels like a very long time ago. Engulfed by civil war, famine and most recently floods, the world's newest country has been plagued by schisms and thwarted by leaders who pocketed its considerable oil wealth. No Western leader has ever made a public visit, leaving many South Sudanese feeling forgotten.
But not by Pope Francis. He arrived in the capital, Juba, on Friday, after visiting the Democratic Republic of Congo -- an African tour intended to shine a light on some of the continent's most troubled yet ignored countries.
Francis immediately issued an urgent appeal to the country's leaders whose violent squabbling plunged South Sudan into civil war in 2013, and continues to sow chaos despite a shaky peace deal.
"No more bloodshed, no more conflicts, no more violence and mutual recriminations about who is responsible for it," Francis said in the gardens of the Presidential Palace, sitting alongside the South Sudan President Salva Kiir and other authorities. "Leave the time of war behind and let a time of peace dawn!"
Excitement has been building for weeks in Juba, where colorful murals of Francis appeared on the ramshackle streets, and the authorities laid the route to the papal nunciature with a new tarmac road, still a rarity in South Sudan.
At the Juba International Airport, Francis was welcomed by Mr. Kiir, an ex-rebel who has led South Sudan since 2011, much of it locked in a vicious feud with his archrival, Riek Machar.
The last time the pope met both men was at the Vatican in 2019 when, in a dramatic gesture, he prostrated himself and kissed their shoes -- a calculated show of humility intended to pressure them into resolving the rivalry that sparked the civil war, and led to an estimated 400,000 deaths.
The two men also represent South Sudan's biggest fault line: Mr. Kiir is a member of the Dinka ethnic group, which dominates the government and security forces, while Mr. Machar belongs to the Nuer, the Dinka's bitter rivals.
If those leaders expected that Francis would be an entirely sympathetic visitor, they received a rude shock on Friday when he lashed out at the notorious, grand-scale corruption that has seen billions of dollars in oil revenue vanish into thin air -- much of it the fault of the leaders gathered around him.
"Future generations will either venerate your names or cancel their memory, based on what you now do," he said.
"The inequitable distribution of funds, secret schemes to get rich, patronage deals, lack of transparency: all these pollute the riverbed of human society; they divert resources from the very things most needed."
Francis came with unusually prominent companions: the archbishop of Canterbury and the symbolic head of the global Anglican Communion, Justin Welby, and the leader of the Church of Scotland, Iain Greenshields. In the colonial era, Christian missionaries in Sudan were divided by the river Nile, with Catholics allowed to preach on one side and Anglicans on the other.
Now the "three wise men," as some have dubbed them, are uniting for a joint pilgrimage -- the first of its kind, church leaders say -- in an effort to bring the plight of suffering South Sudanese to global attention.
Sudan is a predominantly Christian country of 11 million people, of which the Catholic Church claims six million, including the president, Mr. Kiir. Even so, the papal kiss of 2019 had only modest impact on the country's deadly divide.
Although Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar formed a unity government in 2020, local conflicts continue to rage, often manipulated by national leaders, especially Mr. Kiir, as a means of undercutting rivals or consolidating power, analysts and diplomats say. A plan to integrate dueling armed groups into the national army is incomplete.
In a brief address on Friday, Mr. Kiir said the pope's shoe-kissing gesture "did not go in vain". But he acknowledged that "not everyone is satisfied with the pace" of progress toward peace, and repeated his pledge to resume negotiations with a number of holdout rebel groups -- talks that are being convened by the Community of Sant'Egidio, a group close to Pope Francis.
In the latest violence, at least 27 people, including five children, died in clashes on Thursday in Central Equatoria state.
Lamenting that "massacre," Archbishop Welby admonished South Sudan's divided leaders on Friday. "We expected more. You promised more," he said. "The answer to peace and reconciliation is not in visits like this. But it is in your hands."
South Sudan regularly tops the least desirable rankings. Last year Transparency International rated it as the world's most corrupt country (in this year's list, published on Tuesday, it was beaten by Somalia for first place). The United Nations calls it the deadliest country for aid workers.
And a growing pile of investigative reports have documented how billions of dollars in oil revenue continues to vanish. Yet nobody seems to know where the money has gone -- not even the official in charge.
"I don't see the money," Puot Kang Chol, South Sudan's minister for petroleum, said in an interview, "I only see figures on paper."
Mr. Chol, 38, a Machar aide who joined the unity government in 2020, said that oil revenues were directed by the finance ministry, which is controlled by Mr. Kiir.
A sense of malaise pervades Juba, where glitz meets gnawing poverty. Hulking four-wheel-drive vehicles -- often the latest Toyota Land Cruisers -- jostle for space with goats and rickshaws. Luxury hotels offer comfort at Manhattan-worthy prices.
At the Pyramid Hotel, an 11th-floor restaurant offers panoramic views of the Nile and an adjoining shantytown. The fourth floor has the Las Vegas Casino, where, on a recent afternoon, Chinese-speaking gamblers gathered around the blackjack table.
The depth of South Sudan's dysfunction only emerges in places like Bentiu, the capital of Unity State, 330 miles north of Juba.
With large oil plants nearby, Bentiu should be a boomtown. Instead it resembles an impoverished village, with no electricity or running water and few concrete buildings. The wreckage of a crashed airplane is parked at the gate of the city airstrip, used largely by the aid workers who provide what services exist.
Everywhere, there is water. Floods that began three years ago, linked to climate change, now stretch across an area larger than Switzerland, impacting one million people, satellite images published by the United Nations last month show.
U.N. peacekeepers have built 55 miles of levees to prevent hundreds of thousands of refugees from being swamped again. Every day, they patrol the eight-foot-high barriers to check for cracks that could presage a catastrophic collapse.
Water is not the only danger. Most days, Nyayien Yow, a widowed mother of five, paddles out into the floodwater by canoe, where she clambers up semi-submerged trees to collect firewood for sale in a local market.
Cobras and other poisonous snakes lurk in the branches. Then, last month she was viciously beaten by a man who accused her of banging into his canoe.
With little law or order in Bentiu, Ms. Yow didn't even consider reporting the assault to the authorities. "I couldn't do anything," she said simply. "He is a man."
She eventually found help at a nearby shelter run by the International Rescue Committee, which supports women hit by an alarming surge in gender-based violence in recent years.
Longstanding worries about the health of Mr. Kiir, 71, resurfaced in December after video footage showed him urinating on his pants at an official event. Weeks later, the feared intelligence agency, the National Security Service, detained seven employees of the state broadcaster, accusing them of leaking the footage.
The incident highlighted Mr. Kiir's increasing reliance on the N.S.S., said Brian Adeba of The Sentry, a research group. "It's an army within an army, the regime's praetorian guard," he said.
The Sentry co-founder, the actor George Clooney, was once a powerful advocate for South Sudan's independence and is now a fierce critic of its government.
The U.S. government, which gives $ 1 billion in annual aid to South Sudan, has signaled its displeasure with Mr. Kiir by blocking non-humanitarian funding for his country at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Still, some South Sudanese are determined to keep alive the dream of 2011 and to move, as the pope said on Friday, "from words to deeds."
On a recent evening, a local comedian named Akau Jambo, 25, had a drink at The Baobab House, a fashionable bar in Juba, with friends who, like him, had grown up in refugee camps in Kenya or Uganda.
Despite everything, they had returned to South Sudan determined, he said, to make the best of their new country.
"We can't wait for things to change," he said. "We have to do it ourselves."

JUBA, South Sudan — It is just over a decade since the steamy capital of South Sudan exploded in joy, with revelers singing and dancing through the night to mark the birth of their nation as it split from its old enemy, Sudan.
The new country was cheered on in 2011 by the U.S. diplomats who had midwifed its delivery and the Hollywood celebrities who championed its cause. Billions of dollars poured into an ambitious state-building project that offered a fresh start to a people weary after decades of war. “Freedom!” they cried.
Now that feels like a very long time ago. Engulfed by civil war, famine and, most recently, floods, the world’s newest country has been plagued by schisms and thwarted by leaders who pocketed its considerable oil wealth. No Western leader has ever made a public visit, leaving many South Sudanese feeling forgotten.
But not by Pope Francis. He arrived in the capital, Juba, on Friday after visiting the Congo — an African tour intended to shine a light on some of the continent’s most troubled yet ignored countries.
Francis immediately issued an urgent appeal to the country’s leaders whose violent squabbling plunged South Sudan into civil war in 2013 and continues to sow chaos despite a shaky peace deal.
“No more bloodshed, no more conflicts, no more violence and mutual recriminations about who is responsible for it,” Francis said in the gardens of the Presidential Palace, sitting alongside South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir, and other authorities. “Leave the time of war behind and let a time of peace dawn!”
Excitement has been building for weeks in Juba, where colorful murals of Francis appeared on the ramshackle streets, and authorities laid the route to the papal nunciature with a new tarmac road, still a rarity in South Sudan.
At Juba International Airport, Francis was welcomed by Kiir, a former rebel who has led South Sudan since 2011, much of it locked in a vicious feud with archrival Riek Machar.
The last time the pope met both men was at the Vatican in 2019 when, in a dramatic gesture, he prostrated himself and kissed their shoes — a calculated show of humility intended to pressure them into resolving the rivalry that sparked the civil war and led to an estimated 400,000 deaths.

Pope and a Troubled Congo Energize Each Other: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Francis has been slowed by age. But his enthusiastic welcome in Africa has proved a shot in the arm and provided a reminder of the papacy's global reach.
KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo -- Pope Francis put down his prepared remarks and instructed the stadium packed with young Catholics in Congo to make clear their opposition to the corruption that had hobbled their country with a single, rousing voice.
"All together," Francis said. "No to corruption."
The tens of thousands of faithful obliged in a roaring chant as the pope's hands lifted off his knees.
Slowed by age and a bad knee, Francis, 86, had seen the global dimension of his decade-old papacy -- often mired in Vatican intrigues and ideological wars -- lose energy with him. As papal trips to the church's far corners have become more commonplace, Francis' own travels abroad, often in pursuit of interfaith dialogue or atonement for the church's sins, have often failed to draw massive crowds.
Not so in Congo -- an overwhelmingly Christian nation that is the victim of unfathomable bloodshed and exploitation at the hands of outside powers and armed neighbors hungry for its mineral wealth -- where Francis has drawn enthusiastic crowds of a million or more.
They have provided a fresh reminder of the strength not only of his pastoral message of peace and forgiveness but also of the political dimension of his power.
In Africa, while avoiding partisan politics, Francis has not been shy in tackling the most sensitive issues. He has called out corruption. Speaking in strong, even angry, tones, he has shamed the international community for what he called Congo's "forgotten genocide." Most of all, he has sought to bring global attention to the suffering of lands that are too easily overlooked.
In return, the Congolese, thankful for the pope's acknowledgment of their plight and expressions of solace and hope, have given an instant shot in the arm to a papacy seemingly in its final act.
"The pope directs the world's spotlight on us. The world sees us," said Tito Mwamba, 52, a priest who sat in a front row of the stadium in the capital, Kinshasa, where the pope convened a meeting of Catholic youth and educators on Thursday. "There was a huge need."
Much of that need was for mere recognition of the suffering of a nation where more than 100 armed groups perpetuate the spasms of violence that have wracked eastern Congo since the 1990s, killing hundreds of thousands and displacing millions.
But Francis, he said, got something out of his visit, too. "To see so many Catholics in a big country on an enormous African continent counts a lot. Despite his health, it gives him a boost, it gives him more force to finish the journey of his mission."
For Jean Paul Kahamba, 32, a teacher who had come to cheer the pope on Thursday, the symbiosis was even simpler.
"His visit shows that Africa exists," he said. "It's not the first choice for tourism maybe, but there are people here. Congo is not just minerals. It's people. It's not just problems. The headlines are always problems. We are more than that."
As the crowd erupted in chants around him, Mr. Kahamba said that Francis, who he thought was burdened by problems in Rome, received a reminder that the faith was not closed up in old churches but alive in the world and lived by a mass of humanity. "He gets hope in the future," he said. "It's not theoretical. It's here."
Africa's estimated 265 million Catholics make up about 20 percent of the world's 1.3 billion followers. But that number is growing, fueling talk in Rome about a potential African to succeed Francis or at least be in the conversation to become the first Black pope. On Friday, Francis travels to South Sudan, where he has been personally involved in peace negotiations.
But it is Congo that is home to the church's largest following on the continent -- nearly half of the country of about 100 million people is Catholic -- and its most vibrant and influential.
It is also a country that is ravaged by seemingly intractable conflicts, despite, or because, of its treasure trove of minerals such as cobalt and gold, coveted by greater powers from the United States to China.
"His voice makes an echo of the suffering of Congo," said Christian Ngazain, 44, a priest at the stadium on Thursday, who lamented the world's "silence" in the face of atrocities. "Because of the pope's international position we are sure that his message will be listened to."
He said that Africa in return had the power to put Francis at ease.
"All the young people filling the stadium shows him the vitality here," he said. "That we have a secure future."
That vitality, and the pope's gratitude for it, have been on constant display. At least a hundred thousand people, waving flags, perched on rooftops, cheering from overpasses, lined the streets to greet him after he arrived in Kinshasa on Tuesday. Children in Catholic School uniforms turned entire stretches of road blue and white.
More than a million people filled an old airfield on Wednesday for an open-air papal Mass. The faithful climbed up on the wings of old planes to get a better view as Francis waved at hundreds of little girls dancing for him in their communion dresses. "I have very much looked forward to this moment," he said.
Even the day's painful afternoon meeting with the victims of gruesome crimes in the country's embattled east, when survivors put machetes and knives on the floor near the pope to punctuate the horror of their accounts, seemed to remind him of his mission. "Thank you for these testimonies," he said gravely.
And on Thursday, the mere sight of the white Toyota pickup that had been converted into a popemobile triggered an eruption in the stadium, already pulsating with music and dancing under the searing morning sun.
"The pope travels the world, but it's different when he comes here," said Iyefa Paulus, 47. "We are joyous that he has come here, to face us."
Laurent Makesa Pasinya, 6, walked around the stands in the red robes of a cardinal ("He has the vocation," his mother said). Puati Longo, 44, wore a leaf-patterned shirt spotted with drawings of Bibles and the motto, "The Bible is my weapon."
"We have so many difficulties," he said, "but the pope coming makes me so happy."
When Francis had reached the stage, and an aide rolled his wheelchair to his seat, he took in some performances of traditional dance. Speakers, using the French still spoken in Congo decades after throwing off Belgian colonial rule, concluded with impassioned calls of "Vive le Pape!"
"I am delighted to meet you face to face," Francis said.
In his speech, he warned the country's young to avoid the "temptation to point a finger at someone, to exclude another person because he or she is different; beware of regionalism, tribalism, or anything that makes you feel secure in your own group."
To demonstrate his point, and grab the crowd's attention, he put down his speech and instructed the faithful to hold hands "to feel yourself one church and one people" and to sing together a song, which prompted full-throated choruses of hallelujah. "Your good," he told them, "depends on the other's."
That crescendo climbed when he urged the Catholics to "stop the spread of corruption" and to not permit themselves to "be manipulated by individuals or groups that try to use you to keep your country in the grip of violence and instability."
He led them in the "no to corruption" chant, but his orchestration touched such a nerve that the moment got away from him. A good chunk of the crowd, in the local Lingala language, took it significantly farther.
"Fatshi, prepare yourself, your mandate is finished" they roared, using the nickname of the president, Félix Tshisekedi, who claimed an election victory in 2019 even after polling monitors of the Catholic Church, which is an important guarantor of democracy in the country, could not vouch for his win. "Fatshi, the game is over, go away," they thundered.
The pope tried to continue his speech, but a master of ceremonies with a booming voice had to interrupt to admonish the crowd to be quiet.

Ford Lost $2 Billion in '22 As Two Investments Soured: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company's financial performance was hurt by its stake in Rivian, an electric truck company, and an autonomous car business.
Ford Motor said on Thursday that it lost $ 2.2 billion in 2022 as it wrote down the value of two big investments and struggled with high costs and supply chain problems.
The company wrote down its investments in Rivian, a young electric truck maker, by $ 7.4 billion and Argo AI, a company developing autonomous vehicles, by $ 2.8 billion last year. Ford said on Thursday that it had almost completely sold its stake in Rivian. In October, Ford said Argo was winding down.
The automaker said its revenue had risen about 16 percent, to $ 158 billion, mainly because of higher car prices. The company sold 4.2 million vehicles worldwide, up from 3.9 million in 2021.
Ford has long struggled to reduce defects and recalls in its cars and trucks. Recalls can be expensive and time consuming, and company executives said on Thursday that they were working to improve the reliability of their vehicles.
"In simple terms, we need to improve quality and lower costs now," the company's chief financial officer, John Lawler, said in a conference call.
Ford's performance was also hurt by a $ 600 million loss stemming from its joint ventures in China and about $ 12 billion in special expenses, including those related to Argo and Rivian, which has lost much of its value since it listed on the stock exchange in November 2021.
Excluding the special expenses, interest and taxes, Ford made a $ 10.4 billion profit last year, it said, roughly as much as in 2021.
"We should have done much better last year," the company's chief executive, Jim Farley, said in a statement.
In the last three months of the year, Ford had a $ 1.3 billion profit, a steep drop from a year earlier, when it booked a large gain from its stake in Rivian. Ford's revenue in the final three months of 2022 rose 17 percent, to $ 44 billion.
The company sold 1.15 million vehicles in the fourth quarter, an increase from 1.1 million a year earlier but about 500,000 fewer than Ford had expected, Mr. Lawler said.
Ford's production has been slowed by the global shortage of computer chips, and Mr. Lawler said the company expected some disruptions to continue this year and a slight increase in production volume.
"In 2023, there is still going to be volatility on chips," he said. "On the older chips used in the auto industry, there is still capacity constraint."
Ford said it expected this year's adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to range between $ 9 billion and $ 11 billion.
Shares of Ford stock were down about 7 percent in extended trading on Thursday.
Earlier in the day, Ford said that its sales of cars and trucks in the United States increased 2 percent in January and that its sales of electric vehicles more than doubled in the month.
The automaker sold 145,070 cars and light trucks last month, up from 142,445 in January 2022, when a shortage of computer chips slowed production and left dealers with few vehicles to sell. At the end of January, Ford had 370,000 vehicles on dealer lots, up from 201,000 a year earlier, a strong signal that supply chain problems were easing.
Models responsible for the increase included pickup trucks, the Bronco sport utility vehicle and battery-powered models. Ford sold 2,264 electric F-150 Lightning pickup trucks, up from just 63 in January 2022, when the vehicle had just become available. It also sold 2,626 Mustang Mach-E electric S.U.V.s, up 11 percent.
Ford halted production of the Mach-E in January while modifying its plant in Cuautitlán, just north of Mexico City, to increase output. Production will restart this month, the company said.
On Wednesday, Honda, Hyundai and Kia reported sales increases of 9 percent to 22 percent, also as a result of improved supplies of vehicles. But Toyota said its January sales fell 15 percent to 134,392 cars and trucks.

Ford Motor said Thursday that it lost $2.2 billion in 2022 as it wrote down the value of two big investments and struggled with high costs and supply chain problems.
The company wrote down its investments in Rivian, a young electric truck maker, by $7.4 billion and Argo AI, a company developing autonomous vehicles, by $2.8 billion last year. Ford said Thursday that it had almost completely sold its stake in Rivian. In October, Ford said Argo was winding down.

Toyota Will Make a Change at the Top as a Toyoda Prepares to Step Aside: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Akio Toyoda, who has been reluctant to embrace all-electric vehicles, will be succeeded as C.E.O. by a Lexus executive.
Akio Toyoda, the scion chief of the Japanese automotive giant Toyota, will make way for a younger successor as the company struggles to adapt to the world's growing demand for electric vehicles.
Mr. Toyoda, who has been a vocal skeptic of the global efforts to shift to battery-powered electric cars, will step down as chief executive and become the company's chairman on April 1, Toyota said Thursday. He will be succeeded by Koji Sato, a top executive at Toyota's luxury subsidiary, Lexus.
Over more than 13 years, Mr. Toyoda, a grandson of the company's founder, turned around Toyota's finances and helped it maintain its position as one of the world's largest and most important automakers through crises both external and internal. But his reluctance to embrace the auto industry's turn toward electrification has made him the subject of fierce criticism and raised concerns among some shareholders that the company, which once led the world in the development of eco-friendly cars, could be left behind.
"A carmaker is all that I am, and I see that as my own limit," said Mr. Toyoda, 66, explaining why he was passing the baton. Mr. Sato "has a mission to transform Toyota into a mobility company," he added. "I expect this new team to go beyond the limits that I cannot break through."
A video introducing Mr. Sato showed him and Mr. Toyoda putting an all-electric Lexus through its paces. In 2021, Lexus pledged that by 2030 battery-powered cars would account for all of the luxury brand's sales in the United States, Europe and China.
During his time as president, Mr. Toyoda successfully navigated the company through a series of challenges that threatened its position as one of the world's top automakers. When he took over in 2009, the global financial crisis had put the company in the red for the first time since 1950, casting a pall over its prospects. And he was immediately confronted with an international recall over stuck accelerator pedals that eventually forced him to testify in front of a U.S. House committee investigating the company's actions.
The company's response to those challenges made it stronger. The lessons learned from disruptions to Toyota's famously tight supply chains after Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami helped prepare the company for the coronavirus pandemic, leaving it better situated than its rivals to meet the surging demand for cars during the last several years and winning it the title of the world's best-selling automaker.
Still, "these 13 years have been a period of struggling to survive one day after the next," Mr. Toyoda said in his remarks.
The Toyoda family has had a prominent role in the company's management since 1937, when Toyota was spun off from an automatic loom manufacturer founded by Sakichi Toyoda. Akio Toyoda's grandfather and father both led the company, and he was groomed for decades to take his place at its head, working his way up through the company's ranks.
Although his family name undoubtedly eased his path to the top, there were no guarantees that he would make it there. He also spent a decade training to race cars, participating in grueling endurance trials in preparation to become the company's "master driver," a role in which he personally test-drove new models.
He is credited with making Toyota a leader in more energy-efficient vehicles -- symbolized by its best-selling Prius, a hybrid-electric car -- but Mr. Toyoda has been slow to respond to the industry's recent movement toward full electrification.
Toyota in 2017 exited an early partnership with Tesla, and Mr. Toyoda was flummoxed when the market cap of Elon Musk's electric car company surpassed that of his own company. As competitors in the United States and elsewhere embraced all electric vehicles and as governments and automakers revealed plans to phase out combustion engines, Mr. Toyoda insisted that the world wasn't yet ready to make the leap, arguing that many of the company's customers, particularly in the developing world, would continue to rely on fossil fuels. Toyota, he insisted, would continue to manufacture its pioneering hybrid vehicles, combining electric motors and internal combustion engines, for decades to come.
In an interview published by Toyota this month, Mr. Toyoda said his views on battery vehicles had been misrepresented by reporters hungry for conflict.
"I've never said B.E.V.s are wrong," he said, using an abbreviation for battery-electric vehicles. "B.E.V.s are an important option. However, they may not be the only option. That point just didn't get across."
As competitors stake out larger claims on the growing market for electric cars, however, Toyota has struggled to catch up. Its first mass-produced all-electric car -- one of many planned models -- faced a recall soon after its introduction last year. And the company has had little success so far in commercializing its big bet on hydrogen-fueled passenger vehicles. The company has also lobbied against stricter emissions standards and rules mandating electric vehicles in markets around the world.
In his remarks Thursday, Mr. Toyoda said his decision to hand over the reins had been prompted by the retirement of the current chairman, Takeshi Uchiyamada. Mr. Sato was selected, he said, because he is young, he "loves cars" and he worked "to embrace Toyota's philosophy, techniques and practices."
Mr. Sato, 53, has spent his entire career at Toyota or its subsidiaries, joining the company in 1992 after graduating from Tokyo's prestigious Waseda University. He became Lexus' chief engineer in 2016 and rose to become its president before being promoted to Toyota's chief branding officer.

Cheetahs Made a Kill. Then a Traffic Jam Began.: [Travel Desk]

Full text: A video showing dozens of vehicles moving in on a pair of big cats in a Kenyan game reserve highlights how "aggressive tourism" can put endangered animals at even greater risk.
The video surfaced online around October. Filmed from a distance, it shows an antelope grazing on the African plain. Suddenly, two cheetahs race toward it and the antelope takes off, running toward the camera. But the cats are too fast. They converge on it and bring it down. They begin to feed.
Almost at that exact moment, a second drama unfolds: The safari vehicles that have been parked in the background begin to move. One dark-colored 4x4 hits the gas and begins driving closer to the animals. Then vehicle after vehicle is on the move -- green, brown, white, in various states of repair. You can hear the voices of the guides within yelling at one another. Some start to honk their horns. The vehicles form a circle, jockeying for position as their passengers hold up cellphones to record the cheetahs and their meal.
A woman's voice can be heard in the background. "Are they stupid?" she asks.
The video was filmed in the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya, home to many of the Big Five animals (lions, leopards, elephants, buffalo and rhinoceroses) that safari participants tick off their lists. The identity of the video's creator remains unknown, as does the date it was shot.
It was originally shared by a Twitter account using the name @DrumChronicles and has been viewed more than 175,000 times since it appeared. Guides and conservationists who have seen it said the video underscored a problem many of them have observed since the Kenyan government began lifting most pandemic-related travel restrictions: safari vehicles packed with cellphone-wielding tourists led by guides who are willing to get too close to the animals.
Overcrowding at popular safari spots was a serious issue before the pandemic, but as tourists have returned to Kenya, the problem has come back with alarming speed and "appears to be heightened by pent-up travel demand," said Judy Kepher-Gona, director of the Sustainable Travel and Tourism Agenda, an organization based in Kenya that has called for stricter monitoring in the reserve.
"Sadly, what is seen in this video is the rule and not the exception in Masai Mara reserve," she said.
In February, a Toyota Land Cruiser carrying tourists got so close to a family of cheetahs, the vehicle nearly ran over one of the cubs.
In August, Simon Espley, the chief executive of Africa Geographic, a travel and conservation company, watched in horror as 60 vehicles idled on both sides of the Mara River, which runs through the reserve, mere feet from where hundreds of wildebeests and zebras were slowly amassing at a crossing point during their migration in the Masai Mara.
When the hooves hit the water, there was a "crazy, chaotic rush as hundreds of tons of steel lunged forward with screaming engines" from the 4x4s that maneuvered to get closer to the herds, Mr. Espley said.
"It was surreal and sickening as we all converged on what is only a few hundred meters of riverbank, jostled for position and somehow avoided collisions," he said.
Mr. Espley, whose company had organized the safari trip for a group of photographers, said he felt "regret and unease" about being part of that crowd. "Everyone in our safari vehicle did," he said. The travelers asked their guide, a local Masai, to drive them away immediately.
"He was happy to oblige," Mr. Espley said.
The problem, which conservationists describe as "aggressive tourism," preceded the pandemic, but it appears to have gotten worse, with guests hungry for Instagram moments and tour companies trying to make up for the losses they suffered when the world shut down.
"Personally I won't go into the Mara Reserve ever again in season because of this," said Michael Lorentz, a safari guide based in Cape Town who leads tours in Kenya. "It actually upsets me so much, and it upsets my guests to see how badly animals are being treated."
An urge to get too close
The human desire to get close to animals, however dangerous, is innate, said Prof. Philip Tedeschi, the founder of the Institute for Human-Animal Connection at the University of Denver, who frequently visits Kenya with his students.
"It's part of our DNA to pay special attention to living systems," he said.
Last summer, a small boat in Plymouth, Mass., came so close to a humpback that it almost capsized when the whale leapt out of the water and landed on its bow.
In May, a 25-year-old woman who approached a bison in Yellowstone National Park was gored and tossed 10 feet into the air. She survived, park officials said in a statement that warned visitors to stay at least 25 yards from the animals.
The behavior may be misguided and dangerous, Mr. Tedeschi said, but it is also an attempt to have a "peak experience," a term coined by the psychologist Abraham Maslow that describes a euphoric state of mind that comes from witnessing or participating in a moment so intense it changes the neurochemistry of the brain.
And it can lead us to put a premium on being far too close to animals -- "literally being able to look over the shoulder of the animal as it kills its prey" -- while forgetting that animals are sentient beings whose behavior is altered by our presence, he said.
The consequences for animals can be devastating, Mr. Tedeschi said.
In Kenya, cheetahs -- the fastest of the big cats, but also among the most timid -- can easily be scared off a hard-won kill even if they have gone days without eating. Vehicles that get too close can reveal a cheetah's position to prey or other predators, adding another challenge for animals that are already struggling to find food because of drought and habitat loss.
Large numbers of vehicles and tourists in the roughly 580-square-mile Masai Mara are also threatening the annual journey of mammals known as the Great Migration, when more than one million wildebeests, along with zebras and gazelles, move through the reserve in July and August, the peak travel months for Kenya.
The Great Migration was already being threatened by other types of human behavior, including urban development, new settlements and fencing for farms.
Tourists clamoring for front-row seats are adding pressure on the animals, who could respond by traveling in smaller numbers or deviating from their established routes to avoid the crush of vehicles and tourists, said Benson Gitau, a Kenyan guide.
Searching for a better way
Tourism is critical to many African economies. By 2030, travel to the continent is projected to generate more than $ 260 billion annually. In Kenya, before the pandemic, tourism accounted for nearly 10 percent of the gross domestic product, according to the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife.
In 2019, more than two million people visited Kenya, a number that was expected to grow by more than 7 percent in 2020, the tourism ministry said. But then the pandemic hit, forcing hotels and restaurants to close and more than 80 percent of companies in the country's tourism sector to lay off workers. And those who did not lose their jobs often had to cope with pay cuts of up to 70 percent, the ministry said.
During the height of the pandemic, many guides lost their jobs and had to use their vehicles as taxis or to deliver groceries, said Mr. Gitau, the Kenyan guide, who works in the Loisaba Conservancy, a 57,000-acre wildlife reserve north of Nairobi.
Visitors have returned steadily, though in smaller numbers. By the spring of 2022, international tourist arrivals in Africa had more than doubled compared with 2021. In October, Najib Balala, then Kenya's tourism secretary, projected 1.4 million to 1.5 million visitors to the country by the end of 2022, compared with 870,000 in 2021.
But as the country welcomed back visitors, leaders began rethinking how to manage tourism in its reserves and parks.
In May, Mr. Balala's office released a 130-page report that called for a "new tourism strategy." Among its proposals: increasing prices for the Masai Mara in July and August (it currently costs up to $ 80 for nonresident adults to visit the park) and restricting development of new lodging in the country's national parks to 30 beds.
There are dozens of camps and lodges in the reserve and the protected areas that neighbor it, according to Masai Mara Travel, a tour company in Kenya. Some camps and lodges in the reserve have up to 200 beds, Mr. Gitau said.
But conservationists and guides on the ground say few, if any, of the measures proposed by the ministry have been enacted.
The Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife, which came under new leadership in October, did not respond to repeated messages for comment. The Kenya Wildlife Service, a state corporation charged with managing and conserving the country's wildlife, declined to comment.
Zebra Plains, one of the tour operators whose vehicles can be seen in the video, did not respond to requests for comment. The video was posted in November on Zebra Plains' Facebook page by a user complaining about the drivers' conduct.
"Whilst our photographic guests usually have off road permits that does not excuse driving between other vehicles and the sighting," the company responded in the comments. "This will be taken up with the guides concerned."
With the Masai Mara increasingly under pressure from tourists, conservationists have been pushing for the "conservancy" model, in which private parcels of land owned by local communities, such as the Masai, are leased to tour companies. They agree to hire community members as guides, camp managers, kitchen staff and housekeepers and to follow rules that include caps on the number of lodges and camps and limits on the number of tourist vehicles. The largest camp in Loisaba Conservancy, for example, fits 20 to 30 tourists, Mr. Gitau said.
Since 2013, when the Maasai Mara Wildlife Conservancies Association was established, about 350,000 acres of wilderness bordering the Masai Mara reserve have come under this type of private-public partnership.
Research shows wildlife fares better where tourism is more controlled. For example, female cheetahs in the Masai Mara reserve raised far fewer cubs than cheetahs in the conservancies, according to a 2018 report in the scientific journal Ecology and Evolution.
Staying in the conservancies instead of the Masai Mara is more expensive -- at least $ 1,200 a night versus a few hundred, said Ashish Sanghrajka, president of Big Five Tours & Expeditions, a Florida-based tour company that organizes trips in the conservancies.
The answer to limiting the number of tourists in the Masai Mara may lie in raising park prices, he said.
"It should be expensive," said Mr. Sanghrajka, who was born in Kenya. "It's supposed to be a privilege. It's not supposed to be a right."
At the same time, a healthy tourism industry is critical to conservation efforts in a region of the world with some of the most endangered species, including black rhinos. Tourism offers local communities an incentive to protect wildlife, and with few other industries offering well-paying jobs, many Kenyans depend on tourism as a lifeline out of poverty.
The goal should be to improve enforcement and monitoring in the Masai Mara reserve, not to discourage travel, Ms. Kepher-Gona said.
To that end, visitors have tremendous power, she said. They can make sure tour companies have guides licensed by the Kenya Professional Safari Guide Association and ask tour companies for their codes of ethics and if the guides keep their distance from animals to avoid disturbing them.
Mr. Gitau said that as a rule, a trained guide will come no closer than 20 to 30 meters to a hunt. "When you arrive there, you have to switch off your engine, keep quiet and enjoy the scene," he said.
Tourists can also act more responsibly by tempering their expectations, Mr. Gitau said. When he picks up guests, he said, he always asks them what they want to see. Often they say they want to see "a kill."
Mr. Gitau said he tells them he will do his best to give them a memorable experience. But he always adds this reminder: "Nature is full of surprises. Whatever happens, just know that it was meant to happen."

And Now a Few Words About How Power Makes You Weird: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gail Collins: Bret, I promise not to hold you accountable for everything the House Republicans try to do during the 118th Congress, but I do want to ask you about money.
Bret Stephens: Uh-oh.
Gail: One of their priorities seems to be undermining spending for the Internal Revenue Service. The I.R.S. really needs more funding to function efficiently, and Democrats want to increase the I.R.S. budget -- a move they say would actually bring in a lot more money than it costs in the long run. But of course the Republicans hate everything related to taxes, and they just want to let the I.R.S. starve.
What's your opinion?
Bret: I'm a Hamiltonian at heart, which means I believe in effective government -- not overweening, abusive, cheap or wasteful, but capable of accomplishing the tasks it has been given. Right now the I.R.S. has reached a point where agents are picking up just 10 percent of taxpayer phone calls. Anecdotally, I hear of people getting I.R.S. letters saying they owe back taxes -- but being unable to get an agent on the phone to explain why. To adapt a slogan from the founding fathers, there should be no taxation without explanation.
Gail: Yipes, we agree again.
Bret: So I'm all for additional funding to make the I.R.S. more responsive. It's when it comes to audits that people start getting worried. Inflation has already eaten into a lot of people's incomes that are north of the $ 400,000-per-household threshold that Janet Yellen has suggested is the baseline for higher scrutiny. It's a recipe for disaster.
Your thoughts?
Gail: Ah, dissension returns.
Bret, do you truly think most Americans would regard the people who live in households making $ 400,000 a year as helpless victims when it comes to having their tax returns scrutinized? That's more than quintuple what the I.R.S. agent doing the scrutiny probably gets for a living.
Bret: Gail, I hope I won't get audited by the I.R.S. for saying this, but here goes: If you think of a middle-aged professional couple living in, say, New York City or San Francisco, each making about $ 200,000 a year, filing a joint tax return, already in a high bracket, paying through the nose for rent or maintenance or a mortgage, you're probably not going to describe their lifestyle as "rich." They're scrimping to send their kids to college, driving a Camry, if they have a car at all, and wondering why eggs have gotten so damned expensive.
Gail: Granted, although a middle-aged couple living in, say, Toledo, might have a different outlook. As much as I adore Manhattan, I don't think its housing costs should be a template for national tax policy.
But about the I.R.S.: For moderate income, or at least not-extremely-rich taxpayers, the increased staffing is mainly to have folks available to answer questions and process paperwork efficiently. The regular staff is currently way down from its norm, as you pointed out.
And for the people on top: making sure they pay what they truly owe will save the government an estimated $ 100 billion or more over the next 10 years. Which could, hey, cut the deficit.
Bret: My advice to the Biden administration, if it really wants to squeeze more money out of the very rich, is to forget the audits and change the tax code. For instance, stop allowing rich families to lock up generational wealth in complex trusts devised by expensive lawyers. If ever there was an undeserving group of people, tax code-wise, it's those trust-fund babies whose main contribution to civilization is that their great-great-granddaddy owned a copper mine.
Gail: Great! Let's make it a crusade. You begin by getting the Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee to take up the cause.
Bret: Hahaha. An even better system would be a low universal flat tax that radically simplifies the job of doing, collecting and checking taxes. Eventually we might even replace most of the I.R.S. with a fully automated system. But I know that's just wishful conservative thinking.
Switching subjects, Gail, we now have two special counsels investigating two presidents for potentially mishandling classified documents. Remember how I told you last year that going after Donald Trump on this issue was a bad idea?
Gail: Bret, once again you saw the future and how it didn't work. By the way, can I congratulate you for the great conversation you had with my former sparring partner David Brooks on Republicanism in 2023?
Bret: Regrets, we have a few. For what it's worth, David and I both agree that you're much more fun to talk to than either of us.
Gail: About the secret document thing: In the real world, President Biden's mishandling was in a different stratosphere from Trump's. Stupid sloppiness versus a deliberate attempt to pile up mountains of secret official papers and hide them away from government investigators.
But yeah, it does ruin the issue for the Democrats. I sigh a sigh of sorrow.
Bret: I guess we'll have to wait and see what the two special counsels discover and determine. But the real issue here isn't the legal one. It's politics. Republicans justifiably will demand to know why this wasn't publicly disclosed before the midterms, when Biden's lawyers first discovered the stash of documents. Trump will continue to allege that he's the victim of a deep-state plot, and wavering Republican voters will feel this vindicates him. And many Americans will ignore the fine-grained distinctions between the two cases and chalk it up to the corruption of the overall system.
All of which could have been avoided if Merrick Garland had simply taken a patient and low-key approach to the retrieval of those documents in Mar-a-Lago!
Gail: Any other advice for Biden I should be paying better attention to?
Bret: Overclassification is a serious government problem -- the point of a terrific guest essay in The Times over the weekend by the Columbia historian Matthew Connelly. Most government material stamped "secret" or "classified" probably wouldn't raise an eyebrow if you read about it in tomorrow's Times. Biden might want to order the declassification of the documents he had at his office and home so that people can know what was in them. I'd do the same for the Trump documents, assuming there are no serious state secrets there. And I'd propose a bipartisan government commission that ends the practice of overclassification. Sunshine is the best disinfectant, as the saying goes.
How about you?
Gail: I'm always good for more sunshine. Meanwhile, want to talk about something tawdry and meaningless?
Bret: Always!
Gail: How about Prince Harry? Haven't read "Spare" but it's one of those books I trust the media to tell me every single bit I need to know about.
Bret: A nauseating character. He seems to think it's OK to denounce invasions of his privacy while he invades the privacy of his whole family for the purpose of making a buck. Or that it's fair to whine about the chilly reception he got from them at his grandparents' funerals, after he'd spent the better part of a year airing the palace's dirty laundry. Or that he can sell himself as a man hard-done-by from his stunning digs in Montecito. He achieves the impossible of making me feel sorry for his father. And he embodies the worst characteristics of his former and current home countries: the unmerited entitlement of a secondary British royal and the self-pitying exhibitionism of a grifting California arriviste.
Gail: Smash!
Bret: Of course, what's really disturbing is that people -- and this includes me -- pay attention. Harry and his wife are basically two trivial people who hold a mirror to the triviality of the societies they inhabit.
Gail: The first time I ever got really interested in the royal family was pre-rupture, when Harry's wife, the former actress Meghan Markle, gave an interview complaining about her official duties -- wandering from one ribbon-cutting to another, attending events where her only real job was to shake hands with people who wanted to be able to say they'd shaken hands with a member of the royal family.
Haven't devoted a whole lot of my life to contemplating the burdens of royalty, but it did sound like the most godawful boring, meaningless job.
Bret: She might have thought a little harder about those duties before marrying into the family.
Gail: If I'm having a bad day I can always remind myself that things could be worse -- I could be a member of the British royal family.
Bret: Gail, let's close on a more uplifting note. The single best piece in The Times last week was Joseph Berger's moving obituary for Adolfo Kaminsky, who, as a Jewish teenager in Nazi-occupied France, saved thousands of lives by using his chemistry skills to produce forged identity papers for those at risk of being deported to concentration camps. On one occasion, he worked two days straight to deliver 900 birth and baptismal certificates and ration cards for 300 Jewish children, giving them crucial time to escape to neutral Switzerland or Spain. The piece is a powerful reminder of Rabbi Hillel's declaration in the Mishna that, "In a place where there are no men, strive to be a man."
May his memory be for a blessing.

Uber and Lyft Drivers Struggle to Make a Living: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Drivers' hourly earnings have increased since 2018, but the company sued to block their raise last year and inflation has taken a toll.
When Lamin Jatta began driving a yellow cab in 2012, competition was stiff to procure a taxi for his shifts from a busy garage in Queens. Along with other drivers, he would have to slip up to $ 25 to a dispatcher to make sure he got a car.
This cost, though unofficial, was on top of his daily taxi lease, $ 120 for a 12-hour shift, which took a big chunk out of his earnings. And if he got stuck in traffic returning to the garage, he would get hit with a $ 25 late fee.
So Mr. Jatta eventually traded in yellow cabs for Uber and Lyft, lured by the promise of more money and working on his own terms.
But now, Mr. Jatta, an immigrant from Gambia, cannot earn enough to support himself and his family. He and other ride-hail app drivers say they struggle to pay their rent and other bills, have maxed out their credit cards, and are stuck making payments on cars they no longer want.
"You work and you make no money," said Mr. Jatta, now 43, who is quitting Uber to become a truck driver. "This is not sustainable."
Uber and Lyft drivers now earn less in fares and tips than taxi drivers, according to new data from the Taxi and Limousine Commission, which regulates both groups. During the month of September, Uber and Lyft drivers earned an average total of $ 5,046, including $ 277 in tips, while those in taxis earned $ 5,844, including $ 865 in tips.
Drivers have increasingly battled with Uber, which sued the taxi commission to block a raise for Uber and Lyft drivers in December. Uber argued the raise could cost the company an additional $ 21 million to $ 23 million per month, and that it could force it to raise passenger fares by 10 percent.
In response, drivers organized two strikes and urged customers to boycott the Uber app. Last week, Mr. Jatta and dozens of drivers gathered outside Uber's office in Lower Manhattan, shouting "Shame on Uber."
Still, Uber prevailed in its lawsuit after a state court judge said the city had failed to sufficiently justify the increase. The ruling will also apply to drivers for Lyft, which was not part of the lawsuit.
Josh Gold, a spokesman for Uber, said that its drivers "remain busy by any metric," and that their earnings have increased significantly in recent years. Uber drivers now earn an average of $ 33.30 per hour before tips, up from $ 23.50 per hour in 2018, according to Uber data.
But the inflation rate -- as of last fall, triple what it was four years ago -- has possibly canceled out some of those wage increases. Last summer, the cost of food in the city was up by nine percent over the previous year. And drivers and passengers are both dealing with more expensive Uber rides. As of September, prices had risen 37 percent over the last three years, according to the data analytics company YipitData.
Many drivers said the higher fares had benefited Uber more than them. "Don't think what they charge you is what goes to the driver's pocket," said Ibrahima Gory, 56, who began driving for Uber in 2014.
Bruce Schaller, a transportation consultant, said the app services make money by charging passengers as much as they can -- and paying drivers as little as possible. "The point of the business is to squeeze both the driver and passenger as much as possible because the companies make more money," he said.
Uber, which arrived in New York in 2011, was once seen by many drivers as a better alternative to the yellow cabs that long ruled city streets. App services like Uber and Lyft offered bonuses and incentives to drivers to switch, and they allowed those who could not afford a taxi medallion -- city-issued permits that peaked at more than $ 1 million in 2013 -- to drive their own cars.
As riders and drivers embraced the apps, the taxi industry plummeted. Taxi owners, many of whom had borrowed hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy medallions at an inflated price, were drowning in debt. In desperation, some were pushed to suicide. Then, the pandemic decimated their business.
Nino Hervias was a taxi driver for 38 years before he lost his medallion in September 2021 because he was unable to keep up with the payments. Though he is considering reacquiring his medallion through a relief program the city created last year, he is not sure whether he will earn enough as a cabby to cover the cost.
In the meantime, Mr. Hervias, 63, is driving for Uber. He earned about $ 1,200 per week last year, but that dipped below $ 1,000 in December -- or less than one-third of the $ 3,000 a week that he could earn driving a cab before 2015.
Currently, there are about 173,000 licensed for-hire drivers in the city, down from 204,000 in early 2020 before the pandemic, according to the taxi commission. The total number of for-hire vehicles, most of which are affiliated with Uber and Lyft, also shrank from 125,000 to about 100,000 during the same period.
"There weren't enough trips for everyone at the height of the pandemic, so drivers had to switch to other industries to make a living," explained David Do, the taxi commissioner. This resulted, he said, in "a major reduction and attrition in the numbers of drivers and vehicles."
But some critics said the number of for-hire drivers was still too high, making it difficult for anyone to make a decent living. "Too many cars on the street is like too many cooks in the kitchen," said Samuel I. Schwartz, a transportation consultant who drove a taxi in the early 1970s. "Everybody bumps into each other."
In 2018, the City Council passed a bill to to establish a minimum pay standard for app service drivers. Since then, the taxi commission has significantly raised wages for Uber and Lyft drivers, who are also scheduled to receive an increase in March that will be the third since 2020 to help offset rising expenses and costs from inflation. Last month, metered taxi fares increased for the first time in a decade.
"The minimum pay standard has really changed the industry," Mr. Do said. "Drivers are making more across the board."
But it has not been enough for Ishtiaq Ahmed, 42, who works for Uber and Lyft and lives with his wife and four children in Brooklyn. Mr. Ahmed said that, more than a decade ago, he used to earn $ 700 to $ 800 a day with the app services. Now, he is lucky to make $ 140. He has $ 30,000 of credit card debt, he said, and he owes thousands more to family and friends who helped him buy an S.U.V. for the job.
Mr. Ahmed and other drivers have criticized the service fees charged by Uber and Lyft, along with government-imposed taxes and surcharges, for cutting into their earnings.
For an Uber trip from Manhattan to Kennedy International Airport in November, Mr. Ahmed earned $ 59.29, or just 65 percent of the $ 91.71 fare, while Uber's service fee was $ 17.72, or 19 percent. Another $ 14.70, or 16 percent of the fare, went to government taxes and fees, including a $ 2.75 congestion fee in Manhattan.
Mr. Gold said that Uber and Lyft drivers have earned less than taxi drivers because they work significantly fewer hours each month, and if calculating by hour, they make slightly more, according to city data. In September, taxi drivers worked an average of 7.6 hours per day compared with 6.5 hours per day for Uber and Lyft drivers.
He added that, last year, Uber reduced its average service fee to 16 percent of the total passenger fare for every trip that started in New York City, compared with generally between 20 and 28 percent before 2015. But government-imposed fees and charges have increased since 2018.
Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents for-hire drivers in the city, disputed Uber's statistics, noting that the company generally keeps data on driver pay secret and only publicizes flattering numbers. "When convenient, Uber hides behind the corporate veil," Ms. Desai said.
Mr. Gold responded that Uber reports detailed data on driver pay, passenger fares and trips to the taxi commission, as is required by city law.
Some drivers said they felt trapped because they had invested heavily in Uber and Lyft when they thought driving for a ride-hailing service would be a lucrative career.
Alpha Barry, 50, who was a yellow cabdriver for about 15 years before switching to ride-hailing apps six years ago, bought a 2017 Lexus for about $ 42,000 when he decided to work for Lyft.
Because of that investment, Mr. Barry said, he cannot return to the taxi industry, even if working conditions might have improved since he left.
"I already put myself in this car, you know, spent all this money on this car," Mr. Barry said.
Mr. Gory, the Uber driver who was a cabby for 20 years, makes about $ 800 a week with the app service and still owes about $ 51,000 on his 2022 Toyota Highlander. He recalled that he was drawn by Uber's ads and sign-up bonuses and incentives. "They were so slick," he said.
By the time he found out that he could not make a living with Uber, it was too late. He was stuck.
"I pay my insurance, I pay costs of repairs, oil change, brakes, carwash -- it's too much," he said. "Way, way too much."

In Saturated California, Evacuation Orders and Impassable Roads

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — A fresh wave of storms inundated California again Saturday, swelling rivers, downing power lines and imperiling travelers during yet another holiday weekend as a procession of atmospheric rivers continued to wallop the state.
At least 19 people have died since late December, with the toll expected to increase, in a series of powerful storms that unleashed destructive downpours from the North Coast to the southern border over the past 2 1/2 weeks.
The state’s northern and central regions have sustained the most damage: Levees have broken, thousands of trees have toppled, towering waves have shattered piers and mudslides have blocked highways. Flash flooding has shut down critical roads in the valleys and coastal areas, and heavy snow has blocked passages east over mountain ranges.
As of Saturday morning, millions of residents from Eureka, in the far north of the state, to San Diego were under flood advisories. Across the state, emergency officials said, some 29,000 people were under evacuation orders and warnings — including more than 17,000 in hard-hit Monterey County, south of San Francisco. More than 41,000 utility customers were without power statewide, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks power interruptions. A federal emergency declaration covered much of the state, with the cost of damage expected to reach hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars by the time skies clear.
The repeated lashings have left the ground beyond saturated in much of California, and the arrival of still more rain has threatened to compound the risk of flooding and mudslides. State emergency officials have sought to shore up hills, evacuate flood-prone communities and position rescue crews in vulnerable areas.
None of the current storms would be considered catastrophic individually, meteorologists say, but the cumulative impact of almost relentless precipitation and wind has posed a formidable challenge. State authorities said the storms, taken together, had claimed more lives than the entirety of the past two wildfire seasons. On Friday, Nancy Ward, director of the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, described the onslaught as “among the most deadly natural disasters in the modern history of our state.”
One to 5 more inches of rain was expected to fall by Monday morning, with 2 to 3 more feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada and up to 6 feet in some places. In Southern California, where incoming storms were expected to bring up to 1 inch of rain in the valleys and along the coast and up to 3 inches in the mountains, Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles declared a state of emergency, anticipating mudslides and flooding.
In Northern California, where the current storm system hit first, roads were a lethal maze of floodwater, landslides, downed trees, blowing snow, spinouts and closures. Authorities in San Luis Obispo County, citing unsafe conditions, temporarily paused the search for Kyle Doan, a 5-year-old who disappeared down a rushing creek Monday after being wrested from his mother’s arms as they tried to escape from floodwaters rising around their car.
At Donner Summit, scientists at the Central Sierra Snow Lab at the University of California, Berkeley, reported nearly 2 feet of snowfall in 24 hours Saturday morning, and state transportation officials were turning big rigs around amid deteriorating road conditions. At 7 a.m., more than 30 semitrucks were parked single file along the shoulder of eastbound Interstate 80 at the Nevada state line.
State, federal and local officials implored motorists to stay off roads that were filled with determined travelers bound for the slopes on a packed Martin Luther King Day weekend.
“If you can avoid travel, please consider staying home,” Mike Keever, chief deputy director of the state transportation agency, Caltrans, said at a news conference Friday. “Watch some football. Enjoy some time with your family.”
But on Olympic Valley Road, at the crest of the Sierra Nevada, a slow-moving traffic jam inched in thick snow toward Palisades Tahoe, a ski resort near Lake Tahoe where, by 6 a.m., nearly 1 foot of new snow had fallen.
Andrew Feldmeth, 24, an engineer from San Francisco, said the three- or four-hour drive from the Bay Area to Lake Tahoe took him nine hours as white-out visibility stopped traffic for hours Friday night.
“People were spinning out like crazy,” Feldmeth said, adding that it was 11 p.m. by the time he pulled into his ski lease on Lake Tahoe’s West Shore. “We were fine, it was just the other people you don’t know about.”
Since the week after Christmas, California has been pummeled by eight atmospheric rivers, a weather phenomenon that summons moisture into a powerful band and then unleashes intense blasts of precipitation. At least five of the atmospheric rivers have been powerful enough to be categorized as “strong” or greater, said Chad Hecht, a research and operations meteorologist at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. That is nearly as many intense atmospheric rivers as the state normally sees in a year, Hecht said.
Forecasts promised an incoming respite.
“We are nearing the end of this active cycle — we just need to get through this weekend and Monday,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA, noting that at least one more large storm system is expected to hit the state Sunday before a shift in weather patterns bring drier conditions.
But state officials warned that the weekend storms, on terrain that was already 95% saturated in some areas, had primed the ground for fresh disaster.
“We’re not out of the woods,” Gov. Gavin Newsom warned Friday in Montecito, where thousands had been briefly evacuated amid an earlier threat of mudslides.
Rainfall totals throughout the past several weeks have been 400% to 600% above average, according to the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center. In some parts of Northern California, more rain has been recorded in the past three weeks than would normally fall in six months.
The good news, relatively speaking, has been an increase in the statewide average snowpack to 226% of average for this time of year and a significant easing in the record drought that has gripped the state, according to environmental officials.
As climate change amplifies normal extremes of drought and flooding, climate scientists say, the state has become increasingly subject to persistent and sometimes violent “weather whiplash.” Swain at UCLA said climate change has essentially doubled the likelihood of storm sequences even more extreme than the one currently sweeping California.
In the Marin County community of Fairfax, police tape fluttered where a waterlogged hillside slid Friday into the backs of three apartment buildings. Under gray skies between storms, Lisa Almquist, 43, in a raincoat and boots, walked a small dog wearing a bright orange waterproof vest past the evacuated complex.
On the other side of the street, where she lives, she said, a nearby creek has been flooding and power has been on and off for the past three weeks, in one case for 18 hours. On Saturday morning, she said, her power had been restored, but she had no hot water.
“Marin is such a funky little place, all packed in among the trees,” she said, sighing. “It’s a beautiful place to live, but it definitely comes at a price point.”
In Los Angeles, where an undeterred brunch crowed packed a Studio City restaurant, Conner Grossman, 20, who was busing tables, said he had been unaware that more rain had been forecast.
“I feel like a lot of people here don’t check the weather,” he said, “because we don’t expect anything to change.”

Steady rain continued to fall across much of California again on Saturday, imperiling travelers, swelling rivers and filling storm drains already taxed by nearly three weeks of catastrophic downpours that have left at least 19 people dead and caused widespread flooding and destruction across the state. Nearly 26 million California residents remained under a flood watch on Saturday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service, and more than 31,000 households were without power.
Here are the details:
— Some 29,000 people statewide were under evacuation orders and warnings and in the Monterey Peninsula, south of San Jose, and rising waters were threatening to cut off access to the rest of the region. In Santa Cruz County, rescue crews conducted emergency evacuations, and officials urged some residents along the San Lorenzo River to leave immediately.
— Amid rising water levels and heavy rain, officials in San Luis Obispo County temporarily called off their search for Kyle Doan, the 5-year-old who disappeared into floodwaters this past week. Officials said they will reassess on a daily basis if it is safe to resume the search.
— Up to 6 inches of rain is expected to fall across much of the state on Saturday — not a huge amount, comparatively, but the sopping-wet soil can’t handle it, and more trees could topple in wind gusts of up to 55 mph. More rain is expected Monday, with a break after that.
— Near Lake Tahoe, heavy snow and strong wind gusts created treacherous driving conditions. From 5 to 15 inches fell in the region Friday night, and it has not stopped snowing since.
— The 19 storm victims across the state since late December have been killed by fallen trees or rockslides and in cars overtaken by floodwaters. Heavy rainfall and fierce winds have destroyed piers, opened gaping sinkholes, and flooded homes and businesses. “These weather events have taken more lives in the last two years than wildfires,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a news conference Saturday. “That’s how deadly they are.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Uber Drivers Say They Are Struggling: ‘This Is Not Sustainable’

NEW YORK — When Lamin Jatta began driving a yellow cab in 2012, competition was stiff to procure a taxi for his shifts from a busy garage in Queens. Along with other drivers, he would have to slip up to $25 to a dispatcher to make sure he got a car.
This cost, though unofficial, was on top of his daily taxi lease, $120 for a 12-hour shift, which took a big chunk out of his earnings. And if he got stuck in traffic returning to the garage, he would get hit with a $25 late fee.
So Jatta eventually traded in yellow cabs for Uber and Lyft, lured by the promise of more money and working on his own terms.
But now, Jatta, an immigrant from Gambia, cannot earn enough to support himself and his family. He and other ride-hail app drivers say they struggle to pay their rent and other bills, have maxed out their credit cards, and are stuck making payments on cars they no longer want.
“You work and you make no money,” said Jatta, 43, who is quitting Uber to become a truck driver. “This is not sustainable.”
Uber and Lyft drivers now earn less in fares and tips than taxi drivers, according to new data from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, which regulates both groups. In September, Uber and Lyft drivers earned an average total of $5,046, including $277 in tips, while those in taxis earned $5,844, including $865 in tips.
Drivers have increasingly battled with Uber, which sued the taxi commission to block a raise for Uber and Lyft drivers in December. Uber argued the raise could cost the company an additional $21 million to $23 million per month, and that it could force it to raise passenger fares 10%.
In response, drivers organized two strikes and urged customers to boycott the Uber app. Last week, Jatta and dozens of drivers gathered outside Uber’s office in lower Manhattan, shouting “Shame on Uber.”
Still, Uber prevailed in its lawsuit after a state court judge said the city had failed to sufficiently justify the increase. The ruling will also apply to drivers for Lyft, which was not part of the lawsuit.
Josh Gold, a spokesperson for Uber, said its drivers “remain busy by any metric,” and that their earnings have increased significantly in recent years. Uber drivers now earn an average of $33.30 per hour before tips, up from $23.50 per hour in 2018, according to Uber data.
But the inflation rate — as of last fall, triple what it was four years ago — has possibly canceled out some of those wage increases. Last summer, the cost of food in the city was up 9% over the previous year. And drivers and passengers are both dealing with more expensive Uber rides. As of September, prices had risen 37% over the last three years, according to the data analytics company YipitData.
Many drivers said the higher fares had benefited Uber more than them. “Don’t think what they charge you is what goes to the driver’s pocket,” said Ibrahima Gory, 56, who began driving for Uber in 2014.
Bruce Schaller, a transportation consultant, said the app services make money by charging passengers as much as they can — and paying drivers as little as possible. “The point of the business is to squeeze both the driver and passenger as much as possible because the companies make more money,” he said.
Uber, which arrived in New York in 2011, was once seen by many drivers as a better alternative to the yellow cabs that long ruled city streets. App services like Uber and Lyft offered bonuses and incentives to drivers to switch, and they allowed those who could not afford a taxi medallion — city-issued permits that peaked at more than $1 million in 2013 — to drive their own cars.
As riders and drivers embraced the apps, the taxi industry plummeted. Taxi owners, many of whom had borrowed hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy medallions at an inflated price, were drowning in debt. In desperation, some killed themselves. Then, the pandemic decimated their business.
Nino Hervias was a taxi driver for 38 years before he lost his medallion in September 2021 because he was unable to keep up with the payments. Though he is considering reacquiring his medallion through a relief program the city created last year, he is not sure whether he will earn enough as a cabbie to cover the cost.
In the meantime, Hervias, 63, is driving for Uber. He earned about $1,200 per week last year, but that dipped below $1,000 in December — or less than one-third of the $3,000 a week that he could earn driving a cab before 2015.
Currently, there are about 173,000 licensed for-hire drivers in the city, down from 204,000 in early 2020 before the pandemic, according to the taxi commission. The total number of for-hire vehicles, most of which are affiliated with Uber and Lyft, also shrank from 125,000 to about 100,000 during the same period.
“There weren’t enough trips for everyone at the height of the pandemic, so drivers had to switch to other industries to make a living,” said David Do, the taxi commissioner. This resulted, he said, in “a major reduction and attrition in the numbers of drivers and vehicles.”
But some critics said the number of for-hire drivers was still too high, making it difficult for anyone to make a decent living. “Too many cars on the street is like too many cooks in the kitchen,” said Samuel I. Schwartz, a transportation consultant who drove a taxi in the early 1970s. “Everybody bumps into each other.”
In 2018, the City Council passed a bill to establish a minimum pay standard for app service drivers. Since then, the taxi commission has significantly raised wages for Uber and Lyft drivers, who are also scheduled to receive an increase in March that will be the third since 2020 to help offset rising expenses and costs from inflation. Last month, metered taxi fares increased for the first time in a decade.
“The minimum pay standard has really changed the industry,” Do said. “Drivers are making more across the board.”
But it has not been enough for Ishtiaq Ahmed, 42, who works for Uber and Lyft and lives with his wife and four children in Brooklyn. Ahmed said that, more than a decade ago, he used to earn $700 to $800 a day with the app services. Now, he is lucky to make $140. He has $30,000 of credit card debt, he said, and he owes thousands more to family and friends who helped him buy an SUV for the job.
Ahmed and other drivers have criticized the service fees charged by Uber and Lyft, along with government-imposed taxes and surcharges, for cutting into their earnings.
For an Uber trip from Manhattan to Kennedy International Airport in November, Ahmed earned $59.29, or just 65% of the $91.71 fare, while Uber’s service fee was $17.72, or 19%. Another $14.70, or 16% of the fare, went to government taxes and fees, including a $2.75 congestion fee in Manhattan.
Gold said that Uber and Lyft drivers have earned less than taxi drivers because they work significantly fewer hours each month, and if calculating by hour, they make slightly more, according to city data. In September, taxi drivers worked an average of 7.6 hours per day compared with 6.5 hours per day for Uber and Lyft drivers.
He added that, last year, Uber reduced its average service fee to 16% of the total passenger fare for every trip that started in New York City, compared with generally between 20% and 28% before 2015. But government-imposed fees and charges have increased since 2018.
Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents for-hire drivers in the city, disputed Uber’s statistics, noting that the company generally keeps data on driver pay secret and only publicizes flattering numbers. “When convenient, Uber hides behind the corporate veil,” Desai said.
Gold responded that Uber reports detailed data on driver pay, passenger fares and trips to the taxi commission, as is required by city law.
Some drivers said they felt trapped because they had invested heavily in Uber and Lyft when they thought driving for a ride-hailing service would be a lucrative career.
Alpha Barry, 50, who was a yellow cabdriver for about 15 years before switching to ride-hailing apps six years ago, bought a 2017 Lexus for about $42,000 when he decided to work for Lyft.
Because of that investment, Barry said, he cannot return to the taxi industry, even if working conditions might have improved since he left.
“I already put myself in this car, you know, spent all this money on this car,” Barry said.
Gory, the Uber driver who was a cabbie for 20 years, makes about $800 a week with the app service and still owes about $51,000 on his 2022 Toyota Highlander. He recalled that he was drawn by Uber’s ads and sign-up bonuses and incentives. “They were so slick,” he said.
By the time he found out that he could not make a living with Uber, it was too late. He was stuck.
“I pay my insurance, I pay costs of repairs, oil change, brakes, car wash — it’s too much,” he said. “Way, way too much.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Gory, the Uber driver who was a cabbie for 20 years, makes about $800 a week with the app service and still owes about $51,000 on his 2022 Toyota Highlander. He recalled that he was drawn by Uber’s ads and sign-up bonuses and incentives. “They were so slick,” he said.
By the time he found out that he could not make a living with Uber, it was too late. He was stuck.
“I pay my insurance, I pay costs of repairs, oil change, brakes, car wash — it’s too much,” he said. “Way, way too much.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: McDonald's is gone, and the Manhattanization of the New York State Thruway has begun. Prepare to Instagram your pit stop.
Five years ago, the New York State Thruway Authority conducted a survey of more than 2,600 drivers to take measure of the customer experience at the service areas lining the 570 miles of road that make up one of the largest toll highways in the country, stretching from the edge of the Bronx up past Buffalo. Whether participants were traveling for work or for pleasure, they had needs that apparently were going unfulfilled.
Among those who identified as occasional users of the Thruway, more than half said they would like food halls with "local artisan" offerings. Some commuters wanted Blue Apron meal kits. The resulting report listed as chief takeaways that leisure travelers complained about unappealing interiors and the lack of "Instagrammable moments."
In a society so casually stratified that major airlines now offer five classes of service and airport security lines can be bypassed for an annual fee, rest stops remain one of the few spaces in modern life that can be generally counted on to level us. Whether you've arrived in an eighteen-wheeler or a Porsche S.U.V. or a 16-year-old Toyota beater, whether you are a devoted consumer of high fats or an otherwise restricted eater of lean proteins and whole grains, you will park, pass through a comfortingly dull stretch of hardscape and order the McDonald's fries either by way of habit or self-gifted nutritional loophole.
That particular indulgence, though, is no longer available on the New York State Thruway. As of New Year's Day, all outposts of McDonald's were closed, the company's contracts having expired on Dec. 31, 2022. The disappearance of the chain is part of a grand plan of "modernization," in the words of a spokeswoman for the state authority, which began more or less with cashless tolling and is currently taking hold in the reimagining of the Thruway's 27 service areas in line with the desires of a blonde-wood-admiring and flaxseed-positive traveling public.
Two years ago, following a bidding process, the job of operating the service areas went to an Irish company called Applegreen, a conglomerate of gas stations and convenience stores backed by the investment giant Blackstone. Applegreen and its partners will pick up the entire cost of the redevelopment ( $ 450 million), leaving public money untouched and delivering what renderings suggest will be the rest stop conceived as a WeWork conceived as a modern weekend place in the farmhouse style. Some spots might have business areas, and the selfie magic might begin in front of floor-to-ceiling windows under an inscription that reads: "Eat Local. Drink Local."
The Thruway's service areas were originally built in the mid-1950s and brought the equalizing experience of cafeteria food to a world that was much more egalitarian. Howard Johnson's arrived in the 1980s. McDonald's entered the frame a decade later, the last time the stops were remodeled. The current reinvention will bring local farm stands, food trucks and, among some other fast food selections, the polarizing choices of Chick-fil-A, run by a red-state billionaire contributor to anti-LGBTQ causes, and Shake Shack, founded by a liberal billionaire restaurateur who came to prominence serving expensive food around Union Square.
Certainly, there are many reasons to consider it great progress never again to be led into temptation by the golden arches on this stretch of roadway, reminded of the scourge of low-wage work, environmental damage and the aggressive undermining of public health. But on the countervailing side, where we might find some modicum of social good, McDonald's provides a business model that does not market identity. You don't get to pretend that you are chic, or rich, urbane or pious when you order a Double Quarter Pounder With Cheese. You are not buying into a philosophy or a lifestyle; you are buying 740 calories of distraction from life.
For many of its democratizing influences, social media has demanded the imposition of bourgeois aesthetic values all across retail culture, no matter how alienating they might be to those who don't live in a world of plant-based foods and felt-upholstered furniture and who have neither the time nor inclination to record their consumer transactions on camera. The newly transformed La Guardia Airport plays to the iPhone and the compulsion for rarefied space, with an almost perversely cosmopolitan restaurant scene.
On internet chat boards, however, drivers are already registering their frustration with the Thruway changes. Given the deep and longstanding tensions between central New Yorkers and those living downstate, it is not obvious that the people of Utica, for example, would be delighted by the Manhattanization of the highway, over merely maintaining functional generic space that allows them to refuel, grab a sandwich and move along, a dozen potential Instagrammable moments be damned.

U.S. Military Inquiry Reveals Errors in Botched Kabul Drone Strike: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Documents obtained through a lawsuit reveal how biases led to the deadly August 2021 blunder, and that officials made misleading statements concealing their assessment of civilian casualties.
WASHINGTON -- In the chaotic final days of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, U.S. military analysts observed a white Toyota Corolla stop at what they believed was an Islamic State compound.
The Americans were already on edge. Three days earlier, a suicide bomber had killed scores of Afghans and 13 U.S. troops at a main gate of the Kabul airport. Now, officials had intelligence that there would be another attack there, and that it would involve a white Corolla.
They tracked the car around Kabul for the next several hours. After it pulled into a gated courtyard near the airport, they authorized a drone strike. Hours later, U.S. officials announced they had successfully thwarted an attack.
As reports of civilian deaths surfaced later that day, they issued statements saying they had "no indications" but would assess the claims and were investigating whether a secondary explosion may have killed civilians.
But portions of a U.S. Central Command investigation obtained by The New York Times show that military analysts reported within minutes of the strike that civilians may have been killed, and within three hours had assessed that at least three children were killed.
The documents also provide detailed examples of how assumptions and biases led to the deadly blunder.
Military analysts wrongly concluded, for example, that a package loaded into the car contained explosives because of its "careful handling and size," and that the driver's "erratic route" was evidence that he was trying to evade surveillance.
The investigation was completed a week and a half after the strike and was never released, but The New York Times has obtained 66 partially redacted pages of it through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against Central Command.
Central Command declined to provide additional comment beyond statements it had previously made about the strike. The Pentagon previously acknowledged that the strike was a "tragic mistake" that killed 10 civilians, and told The Times that a new action plan intended to protect civilians drew on lessons learned from the incident.
Among those killed was Zemari Ahmadi, a longtime aid worker and the driver of the car.
Responding to a description of the document released to The Times, Hina Shamsi, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing families of victims, said the investigation "makes clear that military personnel saw what they wanted to see and not reality, which was an Afghan aid worker going about his daily life."
The Attack
On Aug. 29, 2021, an American MQ-9 Reaper drone shot a Hellfire missile at a white Toyota Corolla in a neighborhood near the Kabul airport.
Within 20 minutes, multiple military officials and members of the strike team learned that analysts had seen possible civilian casualties in video feeds, according to their sworn statements for the investigation.
Two to three hours after the attack, analysts who had reviewed the footage frame by frame assessed that three children had been killed. An officer then shared that information with two top commanders in Afghanistan, Maj. Gen. Christopher Donahue, the ground force commander, and Rear Adm. Peter G. Vasely.
In sworn statements, six of nine witnesses described learning immediately after the strike that civilians were in the area and may have been killed.
Later that day, Central Command said in a statement that officials were "assessing the possibilities of civilian casualties" but had "no indications at this time."
An update several hours later noted that powerful subsequent explosions may have caused civilian casualties but did not mention that analysts had already assessed three children were killed.
Three days later, Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that the strike was "righteous" and had killed an ISIS facilitator as well as "others," but who they were, "we don't know. We'll try to sort through all of that."
Over the next several weeks, Pentagon officials continued to say that an ISIS target was killed in the strike, even as evidence mounted to the contrary.
On Sept. 10, a Times investigation based on video evidence and interviews with more than a dozen of Mr. Ahmadi's co-workers and family members in Kabul found no evidence that explosives were present in the vehicle.
Mr. Ahmadi, who worked as an electrical engineer for a California-based aid group, had spent the day picking up his employer's laptop, taking colleagues to and from work and loading canisters of water into his trunk to bring home to his family.
Officials insisted that their target had visited an ISIS "safe house," but The Times found that the building was actually the home of Mr. Ahmadi's boss, whose laptop he was picking up.
A week after the Times investigation was published, military officials acknowledged that 10 civilians had been killed and that Mr. Ahmadi posed no threat and had no connection to ISIS.
Tracking a White Toyota
A subsequent review led by the Air Force inspector general, Lt. Gen. Sami D. Said, remains classified. But the general acknowledged that confirmation bias -- a tendency to look for, analyze or remember information in a way that supports an existing belief -- was an important factor in how Mr. Ahmadi became a target.
The documents obtained by The Times offer specific examples of how confirmation bias led to errors, including the military's conclusion that the car it was looking for was the one Mr. Ahmadi was driving.
According to the documents, U.S. intelligence reports on Aug. 29 indicated that an Islamic State affiliate known as ISIS-K was planning an imminent attack on the airport that could involve suicide bombers, "rockets on timers" in the back of a vehicle, and a white Toyota Corolla.
Surveillance aircraft began tracking the white Corolla that Mr. Ahmadi was driving after it stopped at an "established ISIS-K compound." Drones followed the car to "a second building," where they observed Mr. Ahmadi as he "carefully loaded" a "package" into the trunk. Analysts assessed the package to be explosives "based on the careful handling and size of the material."
Over the next several hours, analysts watched as the car made stops and dropped off "adult males," some of whom were carrying "bags or other box-shaped objects." At one point, an analyst described how the car was "gingerly loaded with a box carried by five adult males."
The investigation notes the car's other movements that day, including that it entered a mall parking garage, that "bags" and "jugs" were unloaded from the trunk, and that it stopped at a Taliban checkpoint.
Analysts said the car followed an "erratic route" that was "consistent with ISIS-K directives to avoid close circuit cameras and pre-attack posture historically demonstrated by the group."
By the time the car pulled into an open-air garage at a house enclosed by "high walls" about one mile from the airport, military officials were ready to authorize the strike.
A man who was seen opening and closing the gate for the car was also assessed to be a part of the threat. "I personally believed this to be a likely staging location and the moving personnel to likely be a part of the overall attack plot," one official recounted to investigators. "That was my perception, and it was largely based on both someone immediately shutting the gate behind the vehicle and someone running in the courtyard."
At this point, new intelligence indicated the airport attack would be delayed until the following day, according to one of the investigation's interviewees, but military personnel were concerned that they could lose the target.
Thinking that the walls would limit the blast radius from reaching pedestrians on the street, the strike team launched a Hellfire missile at the vehicle. Shortly after impact, witnesses said they saw large secondary explosions, which helped confirm investigators' belief that the vehicle contained explosives.
But the documents present a less definitive understanding of the source of the secondary explosion. "Conflicting opinions from experts regarding the secondary explosion makes it inconclusive regarding the source of the flame seen after the strike," according to the report's findings, which recommended further investigation.
Footage of the minutes after the strike obtained by The Times shows a fireball from the blast, which expands several seconds later. On Sept. 17, after additional review, military officials said the explosion was probably a propane or gas tank.
The investigation refers to an additional surveillance drone not under military control that was also tracking the vehicle but does not specify what it observed. The Times confirmed that the drone was operated by the C.I.A. and observed children, possibly in the car, moments before impact, as CNN had reported.
The military investigation includes recommendations for better coordination, but the documents do not mention that the C.I.A. drone observed children before impact.
"When confirmation bias was so deadly in this case, you have to ask how many other people targeted by the military over the years were also unjustly killed," Ms. Shamsi said.
The investigation noted that a rocket attack at the airport did occur the next day, about 200 meters from the supposed "ISIS compound" where Mr. Ahmadi first stopped -- the event that triggered the initial surveillance. Times journalists identified the car from which the rockets were launched as a white Toyota.
A year later, in August 2022, the Pentagon announced a plan for preventing civilian deaths in U.S. military operations that includes imposing a new system to reduce the risk of confirmation bias and misidentifying targets.
The Pentagon is still developing the policy, which incorporates training on mitigating cognitive bias and creates "civilian harm assessment cells." It will also give the U.S. military more ways to respond to victims, in addition to condolence payments to survivors and family members of those harmed.
None of Mr. Ahmadi's surviving relatives have received monetary assistance from the U.S. government as a result of the strike.
One of Mr. Ahmadi's brothers, Emal Ahmadi, whose toddler Malika was also killed in the strike, arrived in the United States last week.
"I thought the U.S. government would welcome us, meet with us," he said. "We are waiting for them."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company's production was limited by a global chip shortage, but it made big gains in the fastest-growing segment of the auto market.
Ford Motor reported Thursday that its new-vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2022 as shortages of computer chips and other supply disruptions slowed its production of trucks and sport utility vehicles.
The automaker said it sold 1.85 million cars and light trucks in the United States last year, as well as 13,539 heavy trucks.
Ford's sales decline was in step with most other automakers. Overall, the industry sold about 13.8 million new vehicles in 2022, about one million fewer than in 2021, according to Edmunds, a market research firm. On Wednesday, Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Stellantis reported significant declines in 2022 sales. General Motors was an exception: Its new-vehicle sales rose 2.5 percent, to 2.3 million vehicles.
For the last two years, automakers around the world have been hampered by a shortage of semiconductors, the tiny brains used in electronic devices that control a vehicle's engine, transmission, display screen and other major components. The chip shortage eased somewhat in 2022, but other supply problems were caused by Covid-19 outbreaks that at times interrupted production of key parts in China and Southeast Asia.
Supply issues limited the number of pickup trucks that Ford was able to produce, and sales of its F-Series trucks fell 10 percent, to 653,957 vehicles, although the F-Series remained the top-selling vehicle line in the U.S. market.
One bright spot for Ford was the introduction last spring of an electric pickup truck, the F-150 Lightning. The company said it sold 15,617 Lightnings in 2022, fewer than expected as it ramped up production of battery packs for the vehicle.
Ford also said it sold 6,500 electric delivery vans. Sales of an electric S.U.V, the Mustang Mach E, increased 45 percent, to 39,458 vehicles.
The company is counting on a surge in electric vehicle sales to drive growth this year. The automaker is building two battery plants in Kentucky and a third battery plant and a new electric truck plant in Tennessee.

Supply Problems and Falling Demand Hurt Auto Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A global semiconductor shortage is easing, which could allow carmakers to lift production this year. But higher interest rates could keep sales low.
Last year, sales of new cars and trucks fell to their lowest level in a decade because automakers could not make enough vehicles for consumers to buy. This year, sales are likely to remain soft, but for an entirely different reason -- weakening demand.
The Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, which are intended to slow inflation, have made it harder and more expensive for consumers to finance automobile purchases, after prices had already risen to record highs.
Analysts expect that higher rates and a slowing economy will force some U.S. shoppers to delay car purchases or steer away from showrooms altogether in 2023 even if automakers crank out more vehicles than they did last year because they can get more parts.
"For over a decade, low interest rates have helped people buy the big cars that Americans like," said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, a market research firm. "Low rates from the Fed are what made those attractive offers for zero-percent financing and 72-month loans possible, but with the higher rates, it's a pretty unfriendly market for people buying a car."
Edmunds estimates that automakers will sell 14.8 million cars and trucks in the United States this year, which would be well below the sales that automakers became accustomed to in the previous decade.
Analysts expect the industry will have sold fewer than 14 million light trucks and cars last year in the United States once large automakers have reported their deliveries for the year. That would be a decline of more than one million from 2021. Before the coronavirus pandemic, the industry typically sold more than 17 million new vehicles a year.
If the dour estimates are confirmed, last year's sales total will rank as the lowest since 2011, when the industry had only just begun recovering from the financial crisis and sold 12.7 million new cars and trucks.
"It seems likely that rising interest rates are now constraining demand in the retail auto market," Charles Chesbrough, senior economist at the market researcher Cox Automotive, said in a statement. "With record-high prices and elevated loan rates, the pool of potential new-vehicle buyers is shrinking."
Stellantis, the company formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, said its U.S. sales fell 13 percent in 2022. Honda reported a drop of by 33 percent, and Nissan's sales fell 25 percent. A main reason was the continuing shortage of computer chips, which forced manufacturers to slow or halt production at times over the last two years and left dealers with few vehicles to sell.
Toyota Motor, the world's largest automaker by number of vehicles sold, said on Wednesday that its U.S. sales fell about 10 percent, to 2.1 million vehicles in 2022. But in an indication that the supply of chips and other parts improved toward the end of the year, the company said sales in the fourth quarter jumped 13 percent from a year earlier.
General Motors was one of the few automakers that bucked the industry trend, reporting a 2.5 percent increase in U.S. sales last year, to 2.3 million vehicles, putting it just ahead of Toyota after G.M. fell to second place for the first time in decades in 2021. G.M. said deliveries in the fourth quarter were up 41 percent.
Sales of G.M.'s electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt, rose more than 50 percent to 38,120 for the year. The company also said sales of the GMC Hummer, an electric pickup truck that sells for more than $ 100,000, increased to 854. The company, which has said it aims to do away with internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035, is counting on several new electric models to increase sales this year.
Another company that did relatively well was Hyundai, the South Korean automaker that sells cars under the Hyundai and Kia brands and that has also made a big push into electric vehicles. It's full-year sales fell just 2 percent, and its fourth-quarter deliveries jumped 29 percent.
Sales were strong for electric vehicles and for companies that specialize in that fast-growing business.
Tesla on Monday reported a 40 percent increase in its global sales for 2022, but its deliveries in the last three months of the year fell short of analysts' expectations. The company's stock, which ended down 65 percent last year, fell 12 percent on Tuesday. It rose 5 percent on Wednesday by the close of trading.
And Rivian, a smaller electric vehicle company, said on Tuesday that it fell several hundred vehicles short of its goal of producing 25,000 trucks, sport utility vehicles and vans in 2022.
Ford Motor is expected to report its sales on Thursday.
Automakers have been hampered by forces beyond their control for much of the past three years. The pandemic forced them to idle factories for two months in 2020. Then, starting in early 2021, they had to limit production because of the chip shortage.
The shortage has eased, and dealer inventories have improved but remain below normal levels. G.M. said its dealers had 410,000 cars in stock, about half the number before the pandemic.
Many automakers are also struggling to acquire enough batteries for their electric cars and trucks. Some people have been waiting months to buy certain models, like Ford's F-150 Lightning and G.M.'s Hummer pickup trucks.
Many consumers who want to buy new vehicles are also staying away from showrooms because the chip shortage has pushed prices higher. The Fed interest rate increases have also effectively made cars more expensive because many people must borrow money to buy a new vehicle.
According to Edmunds, U.S. consumers on average paid $ 47,681 for new vehicles in November, the most recent month for which data is available. That was a record high and up from $ 45,872 in November 2021. And the average monthly payment on car loans rose in the fourth quarter to $ 717 from $ 659, Ms. Caldwell said.

Tesla Car Sales Rose 18% in Last Quarter

Tesla said Monday that it delivered 405,000 electric cars during the last three months of the year, an 18% increase from the previous quarter that fell short of analyst estimates and may reinforce investor fears that the electric car company is losing momentum.
Wall Street analysts had predicted that Tesla would sell around 420,000 vehicles from October through December, up from 343,000 vehicles in the third quarter.
The company sold a total of 1.3 million cars in 2022, a 40% increase from the year before. That was short of the 50% annual growth target Tesla had set for itself.
The increases in deliveries were impressive compared with established carmakers, but were less than analysts had predicted and Tesla executives had suggested just a few months ago. Wall Street has grown decidedly pessimistic about Tesla, fearful that Elon Musk, its CEO, is too focused on Twitter, which he acquired in October.
Tesla’s problems include the sharp rise of COVID-19 cases in China, which is weighing on demand and forcing the company to suspend production at its biggest factory, in Shanghai. The company is also facing more intense competition from traditional carmakers like Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen, and softening consumer demand as interest rates increase. Wait times for Tesla models have shrunk, and the company has cut car prices in China and offered incentives to buyers in the United States.
Tesla shares have plummeted in value this year as investors lose faith in Musk’s vow that the company would sell twice as many cars as Toyota, the world’s largest automaker by volume, by the end of the decade.
China, the world’s largest car market, is a big focus of investor concerns. Chinese manufacturer BYD has raced past Tesla in electric-vehicle sales in China, casting further doubt on Musk’s ability to achieve world domination in the auto industry. Tesla has had to repeatedly shut down production in China because of supply-chain problems and rising COVID cases.
Last week, Musk tried to reassure Tesla employees, telling them not to fixate on the stock price and repeating assertions that the carmaker would become the most valuable company in the world, Reuters reported.
The growth of Tesla sales exceeds any major rival in percentage terms. The company is also among the most profitable carmakers in the world and is ramping up new factories in Texas and Germany.
But investors are focused on the risk that traditional carmakers, which have decades of experience mass producing vehicles cheaply, could catch up with Tesla more quickly than expected.
Car buyers, especially the left-leaning, environmentally aware consumers who tend to buy electric cars, also appear to be turning away from Tesla because of Musk. His erratic behavior at Twitter and heated rhetoric on the social media platform have endeared him to conservatives and Silicon Valley executives but outraged many other people.
