SILVER CITY, N.M. — The insurance crisis spreading across the United States arrived at Richard D. Zimmel’s door this month in the form of a letter.
Zimmel, who lives in the increasingly fire-prone hills outside Silver City, New Mexico, had done everything right. He trimmed the trees away from his house and covered his yard in gravel to stop flames rushing in from the forest near his property. In case that buffer zone failed, he sheathed his house in fire-resistant stucco and topped it with a noncombustible steel roof.
None of it mattered. His insurance company, Homesite Insurance, dumped him. “Property is located in a brushfire or wildfire area that no longer meets Homesite’s minimum standard for wildfire risk,” the letter read. (Homesite did not respond to a request for comment.)
Zimmel has company. Since 2018, more than 1.9 million home insurance contracts nationwide have been dropped — “nonrenewed,” in the parlance of the industry. In more than 200 counties, the nonrenewal rate has tripled or more, according to the findings of a congressional investigation released Wednesday.
As a warming planet delivers more wildfires, hurricanes and other threats, America’s once reliably boring home insurance market has become the place where climate shocks collide with everyday life.
The consequences could be profound. Without insurance, you can’t get a mortgage; without a mortgage, most Americans can’t buy a home. Communities that are deemed too dangerous to insure face the risk of falling property values, which means less tax revenue for schools, police and other basic services. As insurers pull back, they can destabilize the communities left behind, making their decisions a predictor of the disruption to come.
Now, for the first time, the scale of that pullback is becoming public. Last fall, the Senate Budget Committee demanded the country’s largest insurance companies provide the number of nonrenewals by county and year. The result is a map that tracks the climate crisis in a new way.
The American Property Casualty Insurance Association, a trade group, said information about nonrenewals was “unsuitable for providing meaningful information about climate change impacts,” because the data doesn’t show why individual insurers made decisions. The group added that efforts to gather data from insurers “could have an anticompetitive effect on the market.”
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., the committee’s chair, said the new information was crucial. In an interview, he called the new data as good an indicator as any “for predicting the likelihood and timing of a significant, systemic economic crash,” as disruption in the insurance market spreads to property values.
The map of dropped policies shows how the crisis in the American home insurance market has spread beyond well-known problems in Florida and California. The jump in nonrenewals now extends along the Gulf Coast, through Alabama and Mississippi; up the Atlantic seaboard, through the Carolinas, Virginia and into southern New England; inland, to parts of the plains and Intermountain West; and even as far as Hawaii.
Silver City shows how the insurance crisis is a result of several factors over decades — and how hard it is to solve.
Founded as a mining town in the 1870s, the city of 10,000 nestles up against the foothills of the Gila National Forest, 3.3 million acres of alligator juniper, ponderosa pine and Gambel oak draped across softly sloping mountains.
That forest has also become a firetrap.
Since its designation as a national forest in 1924, the U.S. government sought to protect the land by stopping forest fires. That policy failed to take into account that fires clear out vegetation, according to Adam Mendonca, the U.S. Forest Service’s Washington deputy director of fire and aviation, who lives in Silver City. The result was the buildup of decades of additional trees and brush, which means wildfires, when they do happen, now burn larger and hotter.
That threat has been exacerbated by climate change, which has brought higher temperatures and drier conditions. Wildfires are now more likely to break out any time of year.
“We used to take our wildland gear home, put it into storage about September and then bring it back to the station in February,” said Milo Lambert, Silver City’s fire chief. “Now it doesn’t leave the trucks.”
Even as the threat of wildfires has grown, home construction has pushed farther into the forest. On a recent afternoon, Eric Casler, an assistant professor of natural sciences at Western New Mexico University, surveyed the neighborhoods that have grown north of the city limits.
“See all these scattered houses out here?” Casler said. If a wildfire started to burn through the area, “it’s going to be really hard for them to stop it.”
It’s not just where people build homes that puts them at risk, experts said, but how those homes are constructed. Outside city limits, Grant County has no zoning or wildfire building restrictions, and no inspection program to ensure that newly built homes are safe, according to Roger Groves, the fire chief for the county, which includes Silver City.
Taken together, those challenges have caused insurers to pull back, according to Susan Sumrall, an insurance agent in Silver City.
Across Grant County, 51 home insurance contracts were not renewed in 2018, based on the data provided to the committee. That’s about 1 in 100 policies. By last year, that number had doubled to 100 nonrenewals, even as the county’s total population shrank.
One of Sumrall’s clients who has lost her insurance is Charlene Rosati. Rosati and her husband had to spend months in Houston, where he was being treated for cancer. Her insurance company, State Farm, sent an inspector to check if the home was being properly maintained, Rosati said, and concluded it was not.
Rosati’s husband died in September last year. Soon after, State Farm told her it wouldn’t renew her coverage. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
Many homes in and around Silver City are mobile or manufactured homes, which can offer less protection against fires than traditional site-built houses. Lorri Williams lives in a manufactured home in a valley just outside of Silver City. She, too, got a letter from her insurer, Standard Casualty Co., based in Texas.
“Reason — unsatisfactory risk,” the company wrote in block letters. “Your home is either located inside of or in close proximity of an area that is identified as having a high risk of wildfire.”
Standard Casualty did not respond to a request for comment.
People who lose insurance often don’t have great options. Williams’ broker, Chelsea Hotchkiss, tried getting her another insurer, with no luck. Hotchkiss suggested the state-run high-risk insurance program, which offers coverage to homeowners who can’t find it on the private market. But that program is more expensive and provides less coverage.
After Zimmel got his nonrenewal letter this month, he called State Farm, which declined to cover him. His insurance agent struck out with three more carriers, including Travelers. (State Farm and Travelers did not respond to requests for comment.) Finally, a smaller company agreed to insure his house, but his premiums jumped by one-third.
Zimmel’s bigger worry, he said, is how the struggle over insurance could affect his home’s value, which his real estate agent estimates at about $725,000.
“I just don’t know what’s going to happen to the town if this keeps happening,” said Zimmel’s agent, Shelley Scarborough.
Officials are trying to reduce wildfire risk. The county is looking at setting building standards to cut fire exposure, Groves said. State officials are also considering ways to get more homeowners to clear the vegetation from their property, possibly through a pilot project in nearby Lincoln County that would make those steps necessary to qualify for the state high-risk insurance pool.
And the U.S. Forest Service is trying to clear out decades’ worth of thick brush and other excess vegetation — what experts call “treating” the forest. That process is anything but simple.
In the parts of the forest nearest the city, workers have cut down smaller trees, low-hanging branches and scrub oak, then stacked them into piles to dry out. After a year or so, the piles are set on fire — ideally during the winter, to reduce the risk of the fire spreading.
After those two steps, the Forest Service can perform a prescribed burn — deliberately setting fire to a patch of the forest to further clear out the vegetation. To maintain that work, the process should typically be repeated every five to 10 years.
The Forest Service has been treating between 25,000 and 30,000 of the 3.3 million acres in the Gila forest each year, according to Mendonca. “It’s a constant struggle for the agency to try to address,” he said, citing a shortage of staffing, money and time.
The underlying challenges that are driving insurers from Silver City can be found across the country.
In parts of Wyoming, the growing risk of wildfire is similarly pushing insurers to drop customers. Teton County, which includes Jackson Hole, saw nonrenewal rates increase 1,394% since 2018. Jeff Rude, the state insurance commissioner, said the state was focused on educating homeowners about how to reduce the risk on their land, because tougher building standards are unpopular in Wyoming.
In California, which has some of the country’s most stringent building codes to address wildfire risk, insurers have nonetheless been fleeing. In some counties, nonrenewal rates have increased more than 500% since 2018. Officials announced this month that they would make it easier for insurers to raise rates, but in exchange, those insurers must agree to keep doing business in fire-prone areas.
In Hawaii, the nonrenewal rate tripled between 2018 and 2023, one of the highest increases in the country. The growing risk from wildfires and other threats has led to what Gov. Josh Green, a Democrat, has called a “condo insurance crisis.” In August, he signed an emergency proclamation, setting up a task force to search for solutions.
In coastal South Carolina, which now has some of the highest nonrenewal rates in the country, insurers have been going out of business, reducing their exposure or just leaving the area, said Jay Taylor, an insurance agent in Beaufort County, which includes Hilton Head, an area particularly exposed to sea-level rise, hurricanes and other climate threats.
Homeowners complain about the difficulty and cost of getting insurance, he said. But the desire to live by the ocean, despite the danger, remains the stronger force.
“They may cuss us out,” Taylor said. “But they never stop building.”

Can Wall Street Pressure Ease Brutality in India?: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Pension funds and big investors are pressuring Coca-Cola, Pepsico and others over brutal working conditions in India's cane fields. Some of the sugar buyers are tiptoeing toward change.
The New York City comptroller, who oversees hundreds of billions of dollars in pension investments, is pressuring some of the world's major sugar buyers to stop profiting off child labor, debt bondage and coerced hysterectomies in western India.
The city's pension funds own nearly $ 1 billion in stock in Coca-Cola, Pepsico, Mondelez and others. Those companies, or their franchisees, are among those that buy sugar from the Indian state of Maharashtra. An investigation by The New York Times and The Fuller Project this year revealed a brutal, endemic labor system there -- one that is at times enforced by threat of kidnapping and assault.
"We will bring pressure to bear on the companies we invest in who participate in that system by sourcing their supply from it and by funding it," the New York comptroller, Brad Lander, said in a recent interview.
Mr. Lander is urging companies to work with labor groups in Maharashtra and to demand supply-chain improvements. He has rallied institutional investors including BNP Paribas Asset Management, based in Paris; Sands Capital of Virginia; and the London-based Schroders to do the same. Those firms hold hundreds of millions of dollars in stock in the sugar-buying companies.
The Biden administration is also applying pressure. The State Department has encouraged American companies to use their buying power as leverage to push sugar mills to make changes, according to a State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Diplomats have also encouraged companies to work with labor unions.
An ethics body that advises Norway's sovereign wealth fund (the world's largest, at about $ 1.8 trillion) is also investigating at least one company in its portfolio, according to people with direct knowledge of the inquiry. The company under investigation is unclear. The fund holds stock in two sugar mill owners, Dalmia Bharat and DCM Shriram, and in a major Pepsico franchisee, Varun Beverages, according to public disclosures.
The U.A.W. Retiree Medical Benefits Trust, a $ 60.5 billion pension fund, signed a letter pushing companies to improve labor practices, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Some of those who confirmed the efforts spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters or did not want to undermine their outreach to the companies. The banks and investment firms themselves declined to comment.
The moves represent an attempt to pressure companies that, otherwise, face little incentive to change. Sugar is a huge industry in Maharashtra, so buyers and producers alike have tremendous amounts at stake. Indian politicians could pass and enforce labor laws, but they own most sugar mills in Maharashtra and deny or downplay problems.
Abuse is well documented. Female workers are pushed to get hysterectomies to keep working, often to avoid menstruating or becoming pregnant in dangerous, unsanitary conditions. The industry is also rife with child labor. Workers are kept in debt bondage, The Times and The Fuller Project have reported.
The revelations have become a diplomatic issue, too. A group representing cooperative sugar mills in Maharashtra said that it had complained to the U.S. Consulate in the Indian city of Mumbai about "misleading" news reports. The group suggested that there was a conspiracy to discourage companies from buying Maharashtra sugar.
None of the investors are calling for that. Many say they would prefer that corporations keep buying from Maharashtra and pushing for improved labor practices.
But a core issue is that Maharashtra sugar mills pay their laborers through middlemen and reject responsibility for working conditions, minimum wages and other basic rights. Laborers are paid advances that function as loans, often without documentation.
No companies appear to be seeking fundamental change in how workers are recruited and paid. Labor experts say that, until they do, exploitation will continue.
"We would be encouraging companies to provide remedy to workers," said Caroline Boden of Mercy Investment Services, a small asset manager that focuses on socially responsible investing.
There are tentative signs that companies are responding. Here is how some have reacted.
Coca-Cola
The world's largest beverage company has known since at least 2019 that children were cutting sugar for them in Maharashtra and that laborers were working off debts to their employers.
The company said this month that a group it had helped establish would, in January, begin providing at least some cane cutters with first aid, health and safety training. Four mills, including three that Coke buys from, will participate, the company said. The group will also train factory middlemen on wage transparency and seek to formalize contracts with farm workers.
The company also said that it had worked to provide clean water, sanitation and female hygiene products to fieldworkers.
Coke would not say how much money it had invested in those efforts.
Pepsico
Pepsi said this spring that it was looking into the reports of abuses.
Varun Beverages, a major Pepsi franchisees, this year opened its third manufacturing and bottling plant in Maharashtra.
Pepsi has said that its franchisee buys relatively little sugar from Maharashtra when taken in the context of the state's huge production.
Nestlé
At first, Nestlé told The Times that it had stopped buying sugar from Maharashtra last year "based on the due diligence work we conduct as part of our human rights framework."
That suggested that the company had uncovered abuses.
Pressed for details, a spokeswoman said that she had been mistaken. She said that Nestlé had stopped buying from Maharashtra because of a 2022 Indian ban on sugar exports.
A company document dated late last year, however, lists Maharashtra suppliers. Nestlé said that document was outdated.
In interviews, one sugar mill said that it had sold to Nestlé this year. Others said that Nestlé continued to buy from them through brokers.
Nestlé says that is inaccurate.
Mondelez
Mondelez, a conglomerate that includes Cadbury and Nabisco, said that it was "taking steps to help address labor concerns on sugar farms in this region." It did not elaborate.
The company said it had stopped buying sugar from the Indian sugar company Dalmia Bharat, which owns a mill linked to unnecessary hysterectomies and abuses.
Dalmia, which also supplies Coca-Cola, recently arranged to provide sanitary pads, shoes, socks and gloves to some workers. A doctor had spoken to female workers about menstrual health.

Full text: Among the hundreds, if not thousands, of bites that restaurant critics take each year, there are some that suddenly make us sit up straighter, sharper and happier. These are the dishes that linger in our brains all the way home, that inspire obsessions over what exactly was going on in the kitchen to make those ingredients taste this good. They can be as simple as an ethereal tortilla or as elaborate as a deeply spiced, banquet-worthy chicken biryani.
This year, the task of eating out for The New York Times fell to three of us: Pete Wells, who left the table in August after 12 years on the job, and me and Melissa Clark, who have been serving since then as interim critics. Here are 26 New York City dishes we tasted in 2024 that we'll be thinking about long into the future. PRIYA KRISHNA
Beef Fahsa at Yemenat
It doesn't look all that promising, this thick stew darkly bubbling in a black stone pot. But fold a scalding wad of beef into some flatbread, wait until it's slightly less scalding, and all the spices of Yemen open before you. Rich cloves and cinnamon arrive first, followed by the warmth of Yemenat's custom-blended hawaij, and running through it all is a topping of fenugreek foam, both sweet and bitter. ( $ 22) PETE WELLS

Masa Pancake at Cocina Consuelo
Cocina Consuelo offers one of the homiest, coziest breakfasts in the city, thanks in no small part to this pancake. This is a dense specimen, redolent of sweet-scented masa, lathered generously with honey butter and crowned with a thick fruit compote (blueberries, at last visit). It's as if an arepa married a sticky toffee pudding. May they enjoy a longlife together. ( $ 16) PRIYA KRISHNA

Frogs' Legs at Le Veau d'Or
With their mild flavor, succulent, meaty texture and finger-food appeal, frogs' legs deserve to be as popular as chicken wings. If any restaurant in town can make the case, it's Le Veau d'Or, with its garlicky, bubbling rendition. Wait for the frantic sizzle to die down while you inhale the scent of brown butter and herbs, then use your hands to dig in. Licking the savory sauce off your digits might just be the best part.

Bake and Shark at Trinciti Roti Shop
I used to say there was no such thing as an exciting fish sandwich. Now that I've had the bake and shark from Trinciti, I'd like to take that back. The assembly process of this Trinidadian and Tobagonian favorite, sold only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, is dizzying. The toppings piled over the hunks of fried shark are almost uncountable, though they include tamarind, coriander chutney, Trini pepper sauce and a slab of pineapple. The final product is not easy to eat, but it should be eaten quickly, and with enthusiasm. ( $ 18) PETE WELLS

Patty Melt at the Commerce Inn
It was first served at family meal for the staff. Then it appeared as a blackboard special in the barroom. From there it sidled on to the brunch menu. As word got out, people started asking for it in the dining room. Of course, word got out. The Commerce Inn patty melt has all the classical attributes plus a few little subtle flourishes, like the scent of rosemary in the caramelized onions. It looks reasonably prim and proper, but mustard and mayonnaise and beef fat come gushing out when you eat it. ( $ 18) PETE WELLS

Jang Mool Hoe at Joo Ok
There's an aquarium in your bowl: barely poached bigfin reef squid, delicate Hokkaido scallops and a rich sliver of fresh sea urchin, all enveloped in a slippery, transparent layer of dashima jelly. The flavors are pleasingly restrained, accented by a few dots of chive and sesame oils and a small pool of broth (honeynut squash soy, for now). The jang mool hoe is an early course at this tasting-menu restaurant imported straight from Seoul, and it's a dish for those who delight in the tapioca pearls of bubble tea or the exuberant chew of an udon noodle. (Part of a $ 180 tasting menu) PRIYA KRISHNA
22 West 32nd Street (Fifth Avenue), Koreatown; no phone; joo-ok.com
Potato Salad With Trout Roe at Eel Bar
Potatoes and caviar are an eternal match, with the mild earthiness of the tuber balancing the saline funk of the fish eggs. At Eel Bar, the pairing is revamped as the sexiest salad imaginable, with a bed of creamy potatoes amply crowned by glowing beads of pungent trout roe. The brilliant soft and snappy contrast of textures may be as alluring as the flavors -- or almost. ( $ 18) MELISSA CLARK
252 Broome Street (Ludlow Street), Lower East Side; 646-850-0140; eelbarnyc.com
Dungeness Crab Empanada at Blanca
If you have eaten in any of Victoria Blamey's restaurants going back to Chumley's, you are probably familiar with the way she prepares Dungeness crab. It's complicated. It's based on a Chilean abalone dish. It involves Chartreuse, fermented black beans, assorted bits of crab anatomy and other things that have no business sharing a plate. When you taste it, you feel the time-space continuum yawning open below your feet. In the past, Ms. Blamey has stuffed this crab into potpies and pithiviers, but at Blanca it assumes its most humble, most exalted form yet: an empanada. (Part of a $ 275 tasting menu) PETE WELLS
261 Moore Street (Bogart Street), Bushwick, Brooklyn; 347-799-2807; blancanyc.com
Paneer Ghee Roast at Lungi
You can smell the heady scent of curry leaves before the dish even hits the table at this South Indian and Sri Lankan restaurant. The squishy cubes are fried and stewed in a potent onion gravy, absorbing the invigorating flavor of the spices. Scoop up the cheese with thin, coconut-laced hoppers that will temper the lingering, near-punishing heat in the sauce. ( $ 24) PRIYA KRISHNA
1136 First Avenue (East 62nd Street), Upper East Side; no phone; lungirestaurant.com
Squab at Noksu
The pigeon's desiccated head and clenched foot lent a horror-movie touch to a dish that was otherwise quite inviting. The Cantonese roast duck you see hanging in Chinatown windows was the point of departure for Dae Kim, the chef at this tasting counter inside a subway station. The meat was pinker and juicier, though, and Dae Kim, gave the skin a gorgeous, burnished gloss; it was as crisp and shiny as the sugar on a crème brûlée. Mr. Kim took it off the menu two months ago, but it's too good to stay away for long. (Part of a $ 195 tasting menu) PETE WELLS
49 West 32nd Street (Broadway), Koreatown; 626-657-8420; noksunyc.com
Rich Chocolate Cake at Dinner Party
The best chocolate cake is rife with contradiction. It needs to be dense and bitter but still light and sweet, and covered with enough frosting to grab your attention, but not so much that it overshadows the cake. This one hits all those notes with panache. The crumb is tender and moist, but not heavy, and full of dark cocoa powder for a bittersweet spine. Swirls of buttercream on top are infused with pink peppercorns for a spicy, piney character that might be the last thing you'd think to pair with chocolate cake -- until you take a bite. (Part of a $ 60 to $ 75 tasting menu) MELISSA CLARK
274 Hall Street (DeKalb Avenue), Clinton Hill, Brooklyn; 347-463-9173; dinnerpartybk.com
Yogurt Kebab at Bungalow
This kebab feels like a magic trick: crisp shreds of kataifi encase warm, spiced yogurt that oozes as you bite into it, with a flavor that flits between sweet and savory. The cabbage purée underneath is refreshingly tart, and its whimsical lavender hue only adds to the sense that this is more alchemy than cooking. ( $ 22) PRIYA KRISHNA
24 First Avenue (Second Street), East Village; no phone; bungalowny.com
Latifeh at Sofreh Cafe
Latifeh, a traditional Persian confection, may have assumed its highest and most fragrant form at Sofreh Cafe. Somewhere between a soft vanilla cookie and a dainty cake, two rounds of pastry are filled with fluffy, rose-scented cream, then rolled in chopped, salted pistachios, which add color and crunch to all that pale, ethereal softness. Nasim Alikhani, an owner and the chef, makes her latifeh often, so they never have a chance to get soggy. Each pastry is a diminutive masterpiece you can't help but devour. ( $ 8) MELISSA CLARK
216 Flatbush Avenue (Bergen Street), Park Slope, Brooklyn; 929-294-9240; sofrehnyc.com/sofrehcafe
Chalupas at Chalupas Poblanas el Tlecuile
First, you have to find it. This nomadic Pueblan chalupa stand bounces around northern Queens, occasionally posting intersections and hours on Facebook. From there, things get easier. While your batch of eight tortillas bathes quietly in hot lard, decide whether you want them covered with salsa verde, salsa roja, or both. Watch while they are stacked with white onions and shredded pork. Finally, come to terms with the reality that you aren't going to be hungry again for a long time. ( $ 10) PETE WELLS
Locations and hours: facebook.com/ChalupasPoblanasElTlecuile
Stir-fried Fatty Beef With Cilantro at Uluh
Cilantro, an essential ingredient in many Chinese dishes, is the whole point of this one. The juicy stems are tossed in so liberally that it almost becomes a salad. They pierce the aromatic foundation of garlic and fresh chiles like bright green needles. The beef is thinly shaved, tender and not as fatty as you might think. ( $ 28) PETE WELLS
152 Second Avenue (East 10th Street), East Village; 917-261-5963; uluhny.com
Suma Katsuo Sashimi at Sushi Ouji
Rarely seen outside Japan, suma katsuo (also called mackerel tuna) is a buttery-textured fish that's a bit like fatty tuna. Sushi Ouji is one of the few places to sample it in New York City, where it plays a starring role in the excellent omakase. To make the most of suma katsuo's bold oceanic flavor, the chef Ben Chen cold-smokes the fillets over cherry wood, then drizzles them with a tangy onion sauce sprinkled with sesame and nori. Wobbly cubes of ginger jelly on the side act as bracing palate cleansers -- and make the deeply haunting sashimi course exceedingly fun to eat. (Part of a $ 129 omakase menu) MELISSA CLARK
196 Prince Street (Sullivan Street), SoHo; 646-637-8322; ouji196.com
Passion Fruit Tajín Icebox Pie at Kellogg's Diner
The desserts from the pastry chef Amanda Perdomo often steal the show here, none more than the passion fruit pie. It's more than just a diner pie spiffed up with Tajín; there's creativity and finesse in Ms. Perdomo's vision. The graham cracker crust is elevated with brown butter, the curd filling has the creamy, wobbly texture of instant pudding and the Tajín meringue floats delicately atop, freckled with lime zest. ( $ 10) PRIYA KRISHNA
518 Metropolitan Avenue (Union Avenue), Williamsburg, Brooklyn; 718-782-4505; kelloggsdinernyc.com
Shrimp Cocktail at Penny
The brilliant simplicity of Penny's shrimp cocktail makes most other versions seem underwhelming. Argentinian red shrimp are cured, brined and steamed, then served ice-cold, their sweet, juicy flavor needing little else besides a spritz of lemon. Should you love cocktail sauce, the one at Penny is an overachiever -- tart, smooth and ketchup forward in the best way. ( $ 24) PRIYA KRISHNA
90 East 10th Street (Third Avenue), East Village; no phone; penny-nyc.com
Flour Tortilla at Corima
Serious flour tortillas are still an exciting find in New York City, and no restaurant takes them more seriously than Corima. Made from Mexican wheat, butter and sourdough starter, Corima's is almost flaky and pocked with brown patches where bubbles in the dough met the heat of the griddle, an upside-down wok. It is one flour tortilla that is delicious enough to eat on its own, which is exactly how it is served, with a smear of smoky chile butter. ( $ 9) PETE WELLS
3 Allen Street (Division Street), Lower East Side; 646-964-4836; corimanyc.com
Kohlapuri Goat at Javitri
At last, memorable goat curry around the corner from Bloomingdale's. Javitri's chef, Dhandu Ram, encourages the meat to relax during a patient, gentle braise in the pot, and wallops it with enough Maharashtrian spices and dried chiles to fell an elephant. It's a classic good cop-bad cop routine, and it's devastatingly effective. ( $ 35) PETE WELLS
132 East 61st Street (Lexington Avenue), Upper East Side; 212-206-7575; develop.stackblue.com/javitri-nyc
Pissaladière at Cafe Mado
Built on a foundation of puffy focaccia dough, this pissaladière doesn't hew to the classic line. The other ingredients in this delectably oily, savory tart are similarly innovative. Olive relish nestles next to the caramelized onions instead of whole black niçoise, fat premium Don Bocarte Spanish anchovies stripe the top in place of the usual French fish, and a shower of lemon thyme adds a deeply perfumed and unexpected aroma. It's not even quite as big as a typical pissaladière, but take one bite and you can taste the past melding with the here and now. It's not French -- nor Italian or Spanish -- but Brooklyn to its delectable core. ( $ 21) MELISSA CLARK
791 Washington Avenue (Lincoln Place), Prospect Heights, Brooklyn; 347-627-8298; cafemadonyc.com
Gongura Chicken Biryani at Hyderabadi Zaiqa
This small, subterranean restaurant dedicated to the food of Hyderabad may have more biryanis than chairs. One is made with hard-boiled eggs, another with mangoes and vegetables. More intriguing still is the variety featuring a chicken leg and seasoned with gongura. A leaf prized in parts of India for its lemony sourness, gongura wrests control away from the usual biryani spices, and this kitchen is not shy about spices, carrying the rice in a new and bracing direction. ( $ 16) PETE WELLS
366 West 52nd Street (Ninth Avenue), Hell's Kitchen; 646-952-0066; hyderabadizaiqa.com
Dry-Aged Duck at Heroes
Dry-aging is a technique usually applied to beef to tenderize it, and the process can add earthy, umami flavors to the meat along the way. At Heroes, the chef Aaron Lirette dry-ages duck breasts, and the result is an absolute stunner. After a 10-day stint in the fridge, the breasts are roasted on the bone and basted with yuzu and four kinds of peppers. Thin slices are served juicy and rare, still cloaked in their crisp skin, and impossible to stop eating ( $ 75, serves two). MELISSA CLARK
357 West Broadway (Broome Street), SoHo; no phone; heroesrestaurantnyc.com
Snow Crab Mandoo at Odre
The biggest surprise when you bite into a snow crab mandoo at Odre is the wrapper. Instead of meeting the bounce of dumpling skin, your teeth hit the delicate crunch of thinly sliced radish that's wrapped like a silky sheath around generous morsels of dense, soft crab. It's part of Odre's $ 42 tasting menu -- a true bargain, especially given the quality of the crab, and the finesse when using it. MELISSA CLARK
199 Second Avenue (12th Street), East Village; no phone; odrenyc.com
Fried Halloumi at Cafe Kestrel
These cigars of fried cheese don't look like much. But therein lies the beauty of Cafe Kestrel, where apparent simplicity belies bewitching flavors. The sharply salty halloumi is battered and coated with a coarse, heady mixture of fennel pollen and Espelette pepper. The raw wildflower honey poured over the cheese is so thick and luxurious -- and suffused with the warm spices below -- that it practically demands to be licked off the plate. ( $ 9) PRIYA KRISHNA
293 Van Brunt Street (Pioneer Street), Red Hook, Brooklyn; no phone; kesnewyork.com
Vin Jaune Gelato at Bridges
The Comté tart gets much of the spotlight at Bridges, and for good reason. But the sleeper hit is the restaurant's simplest dessert, a swoop of gelato infused with the floral, savory and even briny complexity of vin jaune, accompanied on my visit by a tart, oozy scoop of passion fruit in its nature-given glory -- seeds, pulp and all.

NEW YORK — Among the hundreds, if not thousands, of bites that restaurant critics take each year, there are some that suddenly make us sit up straighter, sharper and happier. These are the dishes that linger in our brains all the way home, that inspire obsessions over what exactly was going on in the kitchen to make those ingredients taste this good. They can be as simple as an ethereal tortilla or as elaborate as a deeply spiced, banquet-worthy chicken biryani.
This year, the task of eating out for The New York Times fell to three of us: Pete Wells, who left the table in August after 12 years on the job, and me and Melissa Clark, who have been serving since then as interim critics. Here are 26 New York City dishes we tasted in 2024 that we’ll be thinking about long into the future. — PRIYA KRISHNA
Beef Fahsa at Yemenat
It doesn’t look all that promising, this thick stew darkly bubbling in a black stone pot. But fold a scalding wad of beef into some flatbread, wait until it’s slightly less scalding, and all the spices of Yemen open before you. Rich cloves and cinnamon arrive first, followed by the warmth of Yemenat’s custom-blended hawaij, and running through it all is a topping of fenugreek foam, both sweet and bitter. ($22) — PETE WELLS

Cocina Consuelo offers one of the homiest, coziest breakfasts in the city, thanks in no small part to this pancake. This is a dense specimen, redolent of sweet-scented masa, lathered generously with honey butter and crowned with a thick fruit compote (blueberries, at last visit). It’s as if an arepa married a sticky toffee pudding. May they enjoy a long life together. ($16) — PRIYA KRISHNA

Frogs’ Legs at Le Veau d’Or
With their mild flavor, succulent, meaty texture and finger-food appeal, frogs’ legs deserve to be as popular as chicken wings. If any restaurant in town can make the case, it’s Le Veau d’Or, with its garlicky, bubbling rendition. Wait for the frantic sizzle to die down while you inhale the scent of brown butter and herbs, then use your hands to dig in. Licking the savory sauce off your digits might just be the best part.

Bake and Shark at Trinciti Roti Shop
I used to say there was no such thing as an exciting fish sandwich. Now that I’ve had the bake and shark from Trinciti, I’d like to take that back. The assembly process of this Trinidadian and Tobagonian favorite, sold only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, is dizzying. The toppings piled over the hunks of fried shark are almost uncountable, though they include tamarind, coriander chutney, Trini pepper sauce and a slab of pineapple. The final product is not easy to eat, but it should be eaten quickly, and with enthusiasm. ($18) — PETE WELLS

Patty Melt at the Commerce Inn
It was first served at family meal for the staff. Then it appeared as a blackboard special in the barroom. From there it sidled on to the brunch menu. As word got out, people started asking for it in the dining room. Of course, word got out. The Commerce Inn patty melt has all the classical attributes plus a few little subtle flourishes, like the scent of rosemary in the caramelized onions. It looks reasonably prim and proper, but mustard and mayonnaise and beef fat come gushing out when you eat it. ($18) — PETE WELLS

Jang Mool Hoe at Joo Ok
There’s an aquarium in your bowl: barely poached bigfin reef squid, delicate Hokkaido scallops and a rich sliver of fresh sea urchin, all enveloped in a slippery, transparent layer of dashima jelly. The flavors are pleasingly restrained, accented by a few dots of chive and sesame oils and a small pool of broth (honeynut squash soy, for now). The jang mool hoe is an early course at this tasting-menu restaurant imported straight from Seoul, South Korea, and it’s a dish for those who delight in the tapioca pearls of bubble tea or the exuberant chew of an udon noodle.

Potato Salad With Trout Roe at Eel Bar
Potatoes and caviar are an eternal match, with the mild earthiness of the tuber balancing the saline funk of the fish eggs. At Eel Bar, the pairing is revamped as the sexiest salad imaginable, with a bed of creamy potatoes amply crowned by glowing beads of pungent trout roe. The brilliant soft and snappy contrast of textures may be as alluring as the flavors — or almost. ($18) — MELISSA CLARK

Paneer Ghee Roast at Lungi
You can smell the heady scent of curry leaves before the dish even hits the table at this South Indian and Sri Lankan restaurant. The squishy cubes are fried and stewed in a potent onion gravy, absorbing the invigorating flavor of the spices. Scoop up the cheese with thin, coconut-laced hoppers that will temper the lingering, near-punishing heat in the sauce. ($24) — PRIYA KRISHNA

Squab at Noksu
The pigeon’s desiccated head and clenched foot lent a horror-movie touch to a dish that was otherwise quite inviting. The Cantonese roast duck you see hanging in Chinatown windows was the point of departure for Dae Kim, the chef at this tasting counter inside a subway station. The meat was pinker and juicier, though, and Kim gave the skin a gorgeous, burnished gloss; it was as crisp and shiny as the sugar on a crème brûlée. Kim took it off the menu two months ago, but it’s too good to stay away for long. (Part of a $195 tasting menu) — PETE WELLS

Rich Chocolate Cake at Dinner Party
The best chocolate cake is rife with contradiction. It needs to be dense and bitter but still light and sweet, and covered with enough frosting to grab your attention, but not so much that it overshadows the cake. This one hits all those notes with panache. The crumb is tender and moist, but not heavy, and full of dark cocoa powder for a bittersweet spine. Swirls of buttercream on top are infused with pink peppercorns for a spicy, piney character that might be the last thing you’d think to pair with chocolate cake — until you take a bite. (Part of a $60 to $75 tasting menu) — MELISSA CLARK

Yogurt Kebab at Bungalow
This kebab feels like a magic trick: crisp shreds of kataifi encase warm, spiced yogurt that oozes as you bite into it, with a flavor that flits between sweet and savory. The cabbage purée underneath is refreshingly tart, and its whimsical lavender hue only adds to the sense that this is more alchemy than cooking. ($22) — PRIYA KRISHNA
24 First Ave. (Second Street), East Village; no phone; bungalowny.com
Latifeh at Sofreh Cafe
Latifeh, a traditional Persian confection, may have assumed its highest and most fragrant form at Sofreh Cafe. Somewhere between a soft vanilla cookie and a dainty cake, two rounds of pastry are filled with fluffy, rose-scented cream, then rolled in chopped, salted pistachios, which add color and crunch to all that pale, ethereal softness. Nasim Alikhani, an owner and the chef, makes her latifeh often, so they never have a chance to get soggy. Each pastry is a diminutive masterpiece you can’t help but devour. ($8) — MELISSA CLARK

First, you have to find it. This nomadic Pueblan chalupa stand bounces around northern Queens, occasionally posting intersections and hours on Facebook. From there, things get easier. While your batch of eight tortillas bathes quietly in hot lard, decide whether you want them covered with salsa verde, salsa roja, or both. Watch while they are stacked with white onions and shredded pork. Finally, come to terms with the reality that you aren’t going to be hungry again for a long time. ($10) — PETE WELLS

Stir-fried Fatty Beef With Cilantro at Uluh
Cilantro, an essential ingredient in many Chinese dishes, is the whole point of this one. The juicy stems are tossed in so liberally that it almost becomes a salad. They pierce the aromatic foundation of garlic and fresh chiles like bright green needles. The beef is thinly shaved, tender and not as fatty as you might think. ($28) — PETE WELLS
152 Second Ave. (East 10th Street), East Village; 917-261-5963; uluhny.com
Suma Katsuo Sashimi at Sushi Ouji
Rarely seen outside Japan, suma katsuo (also called mackerel tuna) is a buttery-textured fish that’s a bit like fatty tuna. Sushi Ouji is one of the few places to sample it in New York City, where it plays a starring role in the excellent omakase. To make the most of suma katsuo’s bold oceanic flavor, chef Ben Chen cold-smokes the fillets over cherry wood, then drizzles them with a tangy onion sauce sprinkled with sesame and nori. Wobbly cubes of ginger jelly on the side act as bracing palate cleansers — and make the deeply haunting sashimi course exceedingly fun to eat. (Part of a $129 omakase menu) — MELISSA CLARK

Passion Fruit Tajín Icebox Pie at Kellogg’s Diner
The desserts from pastry chef Amanda Perdomo often steal the show here, none more than the passion fruit pie. It’s more than just a diner pie spiffed up with Tajín; there’s creativity and finesse in Perdomo’s vision. The graham cracker crust is elevated with brown butter, the curd filling has the creamy, wobbly texture of instant pudding and the Tajín meringue floats delicately atop, freckled with lime zest. ($10) — PRIYA KRISHNA

Shrimp Cocktail at Penny
The brilliant simplicity of Penny’s shrimp cocktail makes most other versions seem underwhelming. Argentinian red shrimp are cured, brined and steamed, then served ice-cold, their sweet, juicy flavor needing little else besides a spritz of lemon. Should you love cocktail sauce, the one at Penny is an overachiever — tart, smooth and ketchup forward in the best way. ($24) — PRIYA KRISHNA

Flour Tortilla at Corima
Serious flour tortillas are still an exciting find in New York City, and no restaurant takes them more seriously than Corima. Made from Mexican wheat, butter and sourdough starter, Corima’s is almost flaky and pocked with brown patches where bubbles in the dough met the heat of the griddle, an upside-down wok. It is one flour tortilla that is delicious enough to eat on its own, which is exactly how it is served, with a smear of smoky chile butter. ($9) — PETE WELLS
3 Allen St. (Division Street), Lower East Side; 646-964-4836; corimanyc.com
Kohlapuri Goat at Javitri
At last, memorable goat curry around the corner from Bloomingdale’s. Javitri’s chef, Dhandu Ram, encourages the meat to relax during a patient, gentle braise in the pot, and wallops it with enough Maharashtrian spices and dried chiles to fell an elephant. It’s a classic good cop-bad cop routine, and it’s devastatingly effective. ($35) — PETE WELLS
132 E. 61st St. (Lexington Avenue), Upper East Side; 212-206-7575; develop.stackblue.com/javitri-nyc
Pissaladière at Cafe Mado
Built on a foundation of puffy focaccia dough, this pissaladière doesn’t hew to the classic line. The other ingredients in this delectably oily, savory tart are similarly innovative. Olive relish nestles next to the caramelized onions instead of whole black niçoise, fat premium Don Bocarte Spanish anchovies stripe the top in place of the usual French fish, and a shower of lemon thyme adds a deeply perfumed and unexpected aroma. It’s not even quite as big as a typical pissaladière, but take one bite and you can taste the past melding with the here and now. It’s not French — nor Italian or Spanish — but Brooklyn to its delectable core. ($21) — MELISSA CLARK
791 Washington Ave. (Lincoln Place), Prospect Heights, Brooklyn; 347-627-8298; cafemadonyc.com
Gongura Chicken Biryani at Hyderabadi Zaiqa
This small, subterranean restaurant dedicated to the food of Hyderabad may have more biryanis than chairs. One is made with hard-boiled eggs, another with mangoes and vegetables. More intriguing still is the variety featuring a chicken leg and seasoned with gongura. A leaf prized in parts of India for its lemony sourness, gongura wrests control away from the usual biryani spices, and this kitchen is not shy about spices, carrying the rice in a new and bracing direction. ($16) — PETE WELLS
366 W. 52nd St. (Ninth Avenue), Hell’s Kitchen; 646-952-0066; hyderabadizaiqa.com
Dry-Aged Duck at Heroes
Dry-aging is a technique usually applied to beef to tenderize it, and the process can add earthy, umami flavors to the meat along the way. At Heroes, chef Aaron Lirette dry-ages duck breasts, and the result is an absolute stunner. After a 10-day stint in the fridge, the breasts are roasted on the bone and basted with yuzu and four kinds of peppers. Thin slices are served juicy and rare, still cloaked in their crisp skin, and impossible to stop eating ($75, serves two). — MELISSA CLARK

Snow Crab Mandoo at Odre
The biggest surprise when you bite into a snow crab mandoo at Odre is the wrapper. Instead of meeting the bounce of dumpling skin, your teeth hit the delicate crunch of thinly sliced radish that’s wrapped like a silky sheath around generous morsels of dense, soft crab. It’s part of Odre’s $42 tasting menu — a true bargain, especially given the quality of the crab, and the finesse when using it. — MELISSA CLARK
199 Second Ave. (12th Street), East Village; no phone; odrenyc.com
Fried Halloumi at Cafe Kestrel
These cigars of fried cheese don’t look like much. But therein lies the beauty of Cafe Kestrel, where apparent simplicity belies bewitching flavors. The sharply salty halloumi is battered and coated with a coarse, heady mixture of fennel pollen and Espelette pepper. The raw wildflower honey poured over the cheese is so thick and luxurious — and suffused with the warm spices below — that it practically demands to be licked off the plate. ($9) — PRIYA KRISHNA
293 Van Brunt St. (Pioneer Street), Red Hook, Brooklyn; no phone; kesnewyork.com
Vin Jaune Gelato at Bridges
The Comté tart gets much of the spotlight at Bridges, and for good reason. But the sleeper hit is the restaurant’s simplest dessert, a swoop of gelato infused with the floral, savory and even briny complexity of vin jaune, accompanied on my visit by a tart, oozy scoop of passion fruit in its nature-given glory — seeds, pulp and all. ($15) — PRIYA KRISHNA

Full text: Is there anything more joyful to feed people than pie? Custardy, creamy, jammy, nutty, tart -- whatever its flavor and texture, pie is celebratory, often nostalgic and deeply delicious. It makes everyone happy. That's why I believe having a slice of pie with the people in your life who make you feel whole is the perfect way to end Thanksgiving.
It wasn't always this way. I always liked eating pie, but it didn't excite me and I didn't enjoy baking it. No matter the recipe or approach I used, I was never as confident in my skills as I was in making other sweets. So when my editors asked me to come up with six new pie recipes in honor of the holiday, I made it my mission to fall in love.
Our 2024 Thanksgiving Pies
I wanted flavors that were chic and cozy in equal measure, enticing enough to inspire you to try something new, but not too intimidating for bakers who break out the rolling pins only once a year. I wanted to both embrace and update the pies we've come to associate with Thanksgiving, and for there to be at least one option for everyone, regardless of how much effort you want to put in or what flavors speak to you and your crew.
I baked about five dozen pies to create the six recipes below -- and yes, I fell head over heels in the process. I reveled in how soothing and tactile it is to make pie, and how wonderful it was to share it with others and see them sink into bliss at first bite.

[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Cranberry Citrus Meringue Pie
See the Recipe
This delightfully tart pie is an autumnal twist on a classic lemon meringue as bright, tangy citrus curd is topped with cranberry Swiss meringue. The egg white mixture can take a while to temper, slowly warming up over simmering water, then cooling as it's whisked. But patience will pay off as it results in a luxurious marshmallow consistency that holds its shape even after days in the refrigerator. Don't feel limited to lemon and orange for the curd filling: A mix of any tart and sweet citrus -- grapefruit and blood orange, for example -- will work nicely.
Sesame-Swirled Pumpkin Pie
See the Recipe
The addition of sesame in two forms -- as oil and in tahini -- results in a sumptuous spin on a Thanksgiving staple. Toasted sesame oil lends a nutty savoriness that makes this longtime favorite feel new and exciting, and a slightly sweetened tahini mixture, swirled into the pumpkin custard, creates a striking marbled surface. Gently cooling the pie in the oven will help prevent cracking, though depending on your tahini's fat content, it may end up splitting slightly along the swirl lines. (It will still be beautiful and delicious.)
Butterscotch Banana Cream Pie
See the Recipe
This is grown-up banana pudding in pie form. One bite, and you may never want banana pudding any other way. Rich, complex salted butterscotch pudding pairs with ripe, sweet bananas for a balanced (and slightly boozy, if using rum) filling. A crunchy pistachio and vanilla wafer crust nestles the thick custard, while a not-too-sweet crème fraîche topping lightens the whole thing.
Coconut Caramel Tart
See the Recipe
Eating this tart is like biting into a grown-up Girl Scout cookie. A crisp chocolate shortbread shell is filled with a creamy, slightly nutty frangipane, and topped with coconut caramel, drizzled chocolate and flaky sea salt. While making your own caramel may seem like a daunting task, the "wet" method of dissolving sugar in a little water before caramelizing it is approachable and foolproof. Take care to keep an eye on its color to ensure it doesn't burn and end up bitter. Add the cream when the caramel is amber and you'll be in for a real treat.
Coffee and Maple Chess Pie
See the Recipe
This pie is like enjoying maple-soaked pancakes with a cup of coffee, but it's great any time of day. A hint of bourbon, or vanilla if you please, enhances a custardy chess pie base that's then topped with a slightly sweetened espresso-infused whipped cream. Candied orange, while optional, makes for an especially festive, sparkly finish.
Pomegranate Cardamom Apple Pie
See the Recipe
Like most good things, terrific apple pie takes a little bit of time, but it's worth the anticipation. In this variation, sweet and tart apples are cooked first in a fragrant, jewel-toned pomegranate reduction so they all bake more evenly. Placing the pie on the bottom rack ensures that the bottom crust cooks through before the top crust gets too dark. You may be tempted to cut into it warm, but the pie needs to cool for at least four hours to be sliceable.

Is there anything more joyful to feed people than pie? Custardy, creamy, jammy, nutty, tart — whatever its flavor and texture, pie is celebratory, often nostalgic and deeply delicious. It makes everyone happy. That’s why I believe having a slice of pie with the people in your life who make you feel whole is the perfect way to end Thanksgiving.
It wasn’t always this way. I always liked eating pie, but it didn’t excite me, and I didn’t enjoy baking it. No matter the recipe or approach I used, I was never as confident in my skills as I was in making other sweets. So when my editors asked me to come up with six new pie recipes in honor of the holiday, I made it my mission to fall in love.
I wanted flavors that were chic and cozy in equal measure, enticing enough to inspire you to try something new, but not too intimidating for bakers who break out the rolling pins only once a year. I wanted to both embrace and update the pies we’ve come to associate with Thanksgiving, and for there to be at least one option for everyone, regardless of how much effort you want to put in or what flavors speak to you and your crew.
I baked about five dozen pies to create the six recipes below — and yes, I fell head over heels in the process. I reveled in how soothing and tactile it is to make pie, and how wonderful it was to share it with others and see them sink into bliss at first bite.
Cranberry Citrus Meringue Pie
By Vaughn Vreeland
This delightfully tart pie is an autumnal twist on a classic lemon meringue. Bright, tangy citrus curd is topped with cranberry Swiss meringue. The egg white mixture can take a while to temper, slowly warming up over simmering water, then cooling as it’s whisked. But patience will pay off as it results in a luxurious marshmallow consistency that holds its shape even after days in the refrigerator. Chilling the fully assembled pie will make it easier to cut, and wiping off your knife between slices will result in cleaner edges. Don’t feel limited to lemon and orange for the curd filling: A mix of any tart and sweet citrus — grapefruit and blood orange, for example — will work nicely.
Yield: 8 servings
Total time: 3 hours, plus 3 hours’ chilling and cooling
Ingredients:
For the Crust:
1 round Laminated Pie Dough
All-purpose flour, for dusting
For the Citrus Curd:
2 large eggs, at room temperature (see Tip below)
5 large egg yolks, at room temperature
3/4 cup/150 grams sugar
1 tablespoon lemon zest (see Tip below)
1 tablespoon orange zest
1/2 cup/125 grams fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup/125 grams fresh orange juice
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1/4 teaspoon fine salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces, at room temperature
For the Cranberry Sauce:
2 cups/225 grams fresh or thawed frozen cranberries
3/4 cup/150 grams sugar
1/2 cup/125 grams fresh orange juice
1 tablespoon orange zest
For the Meringue:
4 large egg whites
3/4 cup/150 grams sugar
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1/4 teaspoon fine salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Preparation:
1. Parbake the crust: Rap the dough lightly if it’s stiff from the refrigerator. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough on a floured surface into a 12-inch round. Fit the dough into a 9-inch pie plate, letting it slump into the center, taking care not to stretch it. If needed, trim the overhang so it extends 1/2 inch past the rim. Fold the overhang under itself to form a thick ridge flush with the rim. Crimp the ridge.
2. Use a fork to poke holes on the bottom of the crust, and freeze for 20 to 25 minutes, until firm.
3. Heat oven to 425 degrees. Line the firm dough with foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until the edges are golden and puffed, about 20 minutes, then remove the foil and weights and lower the temperature to 350 degrees. Bake for an additional 20 to 30 minutes, until the edges are golden brown and the bottom is light golden brown. Let cool completely.
4. Make the curd: In a heavy saucepan, whisk together the eggs, yolks, sugar and both zests. Stir in the citrus juices and salt and set over medium heat. Add the butter and cook, stirring often, until it begins to thicken and nicely coats the back of a wooden spoon, 6 to 7 minutes.
5. Strain the curd into a bowl. Pour into the pie shell. Place pie on a rimmed baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes, until the edges begin to set but the center still jiggles. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
6. Meanwhile, make the cranberry sauce: In a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, stir together the cranberries, sugar, orange juice and zest. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium-low to rapidly simmer, stirring occasionally, for another 10 minutes, until the sauce thickens. Immediately strain into a medium bowl, pressing on the solids to extract liquid. (You should have a scant cup; discard the solids.) Cool completely, then refrigerate until it’s the consistency of a thick jam.
7. Make the meringue: In a large bowl set over a pot of simmering water, whisk together the egg whites, sugar and salt. Continue whisking constantly until the sugar is completely dissolved and the mixture thickens. If using an instant-read thermometer, it should register 155 degrees, and if you rub the mixture between your fingertips, you shouldn’t feel any grittiness, and it should be quite warm.
8. Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, or use a hand mixer and the same large bowl. Beat on high for 7 to 9 minutes, until the mixture holds very stiff, glossy peaks. Add the vanilla extract and continue to whisk until incorporated.
9. Stir the congealed cranberry sauce until loose. Add about three-quarters of the sauce to the meringue and beat on high for 30 seconds to incorporate it. Carefully fold the rest of the cranberry sauce into the meringue to leave ruby red streaks.
10. Dollop the meringue on top of the chilled pie. If you’d like to brown the top, run a kitchen torch over it. Refrigerate until ready to serve if not serving right away, and serve cold. The pie will keep, refrigerated, up to 4 days (though the meringue may deflate a little).
Tip: Citrus and eggs repeat throughout this recipe: You need 7 eggs total (and will end up with 1 extra white) and 3 lemons and 5 oranges.
Sesame-Swirled Pumpkin Pie
By Vaughn Vreeland
The addition of sesame in two forms — as oil and in tahini — results in a sumptuous spin on this Thanksgiving staple. Just a couple of teaspoons of toasted sesame oil lends a nutty savoriness that makes this longtime holiday favorite feel new and exciting, and a slightly sweetened tahini mixture, swirled into the pumpkin custard, creates a striking marbled surface. Gently cooling the pie in the oven will help prevent cracking, though depending on your tahini’s fat content, it may end up splitting slightly along the swirl lines. It will still be beautiful and delicious.
Yield: 8 servings
Total time: 2 hours 55 minutes, plus 3 hours’ cooling and chilling
Ingredients:
For the Crust:
1 round Laminated Pie Dough
All-purpose flour, for rolling
For the Pumpkin Sesame Filling:
2 large eggs
2 large egg yolks
3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon/163 grams sugar
1/2 cup/120 grams heavy cream
2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, plus more if needed
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin purée
1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1/2 teaspoon fine salt
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon finely ground black pepper
1/4 cup/75 grams tahini (see Tip below)
Preparation:
1. Parbake the crust: Rap the dough lightly if it’s stiff from the refrigerator. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough on a floured surface into a 12-inch round. Fit the dough into a 9-inch pie plate, letting it slump into the center, taking care not to stretch it. If needed, trim the overhang so it extends 1/2 inch past the rim. Fold the overhang under itself to form a thick ridge flush with the rim. Crimp the ridge.
2. Use a fork to poke holes on the bottom of the crust, and freeze for 20 to 25 minutes, until firm.
3. Heat oven to 425 degrees with racks in the center and bottom of the oven. Line the firm dough with foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and bake on the center rack for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and weights, lower the temperature to 350 degrees and bake for an additional 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown all over. Let cool completely.
4. Make the pumpkin filling: In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, yolks and 3/4 cup/150 grams sugar for about a minute, until smooth. Add the cream, sesame oil and vanilla. Whisk thoroughly until homogenous. Whisk in the pumpkin, salt and spices.
5. In a small bowl, whisk together the tahini and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. If it’s too thick to drizzle, stir in a teaspoon of sesame oil.
6. Fill the cooled pie shell with about three-quarters of the pumpkin mixture. Drizzle half of the tahini mixture over the top, then swirl with a toothpick or paring knife. Dollop the remaining pumpkin filling on top of that and drizzle with the remaining tahini. Swirl again to create your desired marbled effect and lightly tap the pie plate to settle the filling.
7. Place the pie on a rimmed baking sheet and bake (at 350 degrees) on the bottom rack for 35 to 40 minutes, until the edges are set but the center is still wobbly. Turn the oven off, prop the door open with a wooden spoon and leave the pie in the oven for 45 minutes to cool gently to prevent cracking.
8. Let cool completely at room temperature, then refrigerate for at least an hour and up to 3 days before serving, covered if chilling for more than an hour.
Tip: Any tahini will work here, but a thinner one makes it easier to swirl in. If you have a thicker tahini, thin it as directed in Step 5.
Butterscotch Banana Cream Pie
By Vaughn Vreeland
This is grown-up banana pudding in pie form. One bite, and you may never want banana pudding any other way. Salted butterscotch pudding pairs with ripe, sweet bananas for a balanced (and slightly boozy, if using rum) filling. A crunchy pistachio and vanilla wafer crust nestles the thick custard, while a not-too-sweet crème fraîche topping lightens the whole thing. Be sure to slice and serve this pie directly from the refrigerator — if it doesn’t stay cold, it may be messy.
Yield: 8 servings
Total time: 1 hours 35 minutes, plus 5 hours’ cooling and chilling
Ingredients:
For the Crust:
1 1/2 cups/175 grams vanilla wafer crumbs (from about 50 wafers)
1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar
6 tablespoons/85 grams melted butter
1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1/2 teaspoon fine salt
1/4 cup/30 grams shelled unsalted pistachios, very finely chopped
For the Banana Pudding:
4 large egg yolks
3 tablespoons/27 grams cornstarch
3/4 packed cup/165 grams dark brown sugar
1 cup/240 grams heavy cream
1 cup/240 grams whole milk
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 tablespoon dark rum or vanilla extract
1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1/2 teaspoon fine salt, or more to taste
3 to 4 ripe medium bananas, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
For the Whipped Cream:
1/4 cup/60 grams crème fraîche or sour cream
1 cup/240 grams cold heavy cream
2 tablespoons powdered sugar
2 teaspoons rum or vanilla extract
1/4 cup/30 grams shelled unsalted pistachios, finely chopped, for garnishing
Preparation:
1. Make the crust: In a medium bowl, mix together the wafer crumbs, granulated sugar, butter, salt and pistachios. Pour the crust mixture into a 9-inch pie plate and use the bottom of a lowball glass or measuring cup to press evenly along the bottom and sides. Freeze for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Bake the crust for 15 minutes, until it begins to turn a slightly deeper golden brown. Cool completely.
3. Make the pudding: In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and cornstarch until thickened. Set aside close to the stove. In a heavy saucepan, heat the brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of water over medium until the sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally. Bring to a boil and continue to cook for 4 to 6 minutes, until the bubbling slows. (It should reach about 240 degrees on an instant-read thermometer; be careful not to burn it). Turn off the heat, and add the cream and milk carefully as they will bubble vigorously at first. Whisk thoroughly. You may have some bits of undissolved sugar, but they will continue to melt.
4. Return to medium heat and cook the cream mixture until it begins to simmer, an additional 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully and slowly pour about 1/4 cup of the hot cream into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly. Pour the yolk mixture into the saucepan while whisking, then continue to cook, whisking continuously, until large bubbles form on the surface. Remove from the heat, then whisk in the butter, rum and salt. Taste the pudding and stir in more salt if you’d like.
5. Layer half of the banana slices over the bottom of the cooled crust. Pour the warm pudding over the bananas and smooth out the top. Place the remaining bananas on top, cover loosely with plastic wrap so a skin doesn’t form and let cool at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Chill the pie completely, for at least 4 hours or overnight.
6. Make the whipped cream: Use a hand mixer and a large bowl or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment to beat the crème fraîche and heavy cream on high speed until medium-stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the powdered sugar and rum and beat until just incorporated. Dollop the whipped cream on top of the chilled pie, top with chopped pistachios and slice and serve immediately. The pie will keep, refrigerated, for up to 4 days.
Coconut Caramel Tart
By Vaughn Vreeland
Eating this tart is like biting into a grown-up Girl Scout cookie. A crisp chocolate shortbread shell is filled with a creamy, slightly nutty frangipane, and topped with coconut caramel, drizzled chocolate and flaky sea salt. This recipe is formatted for a 9-inch pie plate but can easily be amended to fit a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom without any difference in bake times. While making your own caramel may seem like a daunting task, the “wet” method of dissolving sugar in a little water before caramelizing it is approachable and foolproof. Take care to keep an eye on its color to ensure it doesn’t burn and end up bitter. Add the cream when the caramel is amber and you’ll be in for a real treat.
Yield: 8 servings
Total time: 2 hours 15 minutes, plus 1 1/2 hours’ cooling
Ingredients:
For the Chocolate Crust:
1 cup/128 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling
1/2 cup/56 grams powdered sugar
1/4 cup/20 grams Dutch-processed cocoa powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1/2 teaspoon fine salt
6 tablespoons/85 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes
1 large egg, beaten, at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
For the Coconut Filling:
8 tablespoons/114 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1/2 cup/60 grams almond flour
1/2 cup/52 grams unsweetened shredded coconut, toasted (see Tip below)
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1/4 teaspoon fine salt
For the Caramel Topping:
3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar
1/2 cup/120 grams full-fat coconut milk or heavy cream
1 cup/104 grams unsweetened coconut, toasted (see Tip below)
4 tablespoons/56 grams unsalted butter
1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1/2 teaspoon fine salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 ounces/58 grams semisweet chocolate, chopped (1/3 cup)
Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling
Preparation:
1. Make the crust: In a food processor, pulse together the flour, powdered sugar, cocoa and salt until fully combined. Add the cold cubed butter and pulse about 10 times, until the mixture resembles wet sand. Add the beaten egg and vanilla and continue to pulse until a ball begins to form around the blade. (See Tip below to prepare by hand.)
2. Form the dough into a disk about an inch thick, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.
3. On a lightly floured surface, use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll the dough into a 12-inch round. Press the dough evenly into a 9-inch pie plate (or 10-inch tart pan) and freeze until very firm, about 20 minutes. Trim the edges flush with the rim of the pan and use a fork to dock the dough by poking holes all over the bottom.
4. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Bake the crust for 15 minutes, until fragrant and slightly dried out. Cool completely to room temperature, and lower the oven to 350 degrees.
5. Make the coconut filling: In a large bowl with a hand mixer or with a stand mixer, beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and continue to beat another minute until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the almond flour, coconut, all-purpose flour, vanilla and salt and beat for another minute, until fully incorporated. Spread the mixture evenly into the cooled crust and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until slightly puffed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool at room temperature while you prepare the coconut caramel.
6. Make the caramel: In a heavy saucepan over medium heat, stir the sugar and 2 tablespoons of water and cook until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium-high and boil, without stirring, but swirling the pan occasionally. Carefully brush the sides of the pan with water to dissolve any sugar crystals that may be sticking. Continue cooking for 10 to 12 minutes, until the bubbles begin to slow down and the sugar gradually turns an amber color, registering about 320 degrees on a candy thermometer.
7. Slowly add the coconut milk and stir carefully, as it will bubble rapidly when added. Continue to cook the caramel another 7 to 10 minutes, until visibly thickened and glossy. It should register 250 degrees on a candy thermometer. Remove from the heat, add the coconut, butter, salt and vanilla, and stir to combine. Let cool for about 10 minutes before spreading the caramel over the top of the baked tart, then let cool completely.
8. Melt the chocolate by stirring in a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Alternatively, place the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for about 30 seconds. Stir, then microwave in 15-second bursts, stirring after each interval, until completely melted. Drizzle the melted chocolate over the cooled tart, top with flaky salt, slice and serve. The tart will keep, covered, at room temperature for 2 to 3 days, and up to 4 days in the refrigerator. If it’s been refrigerated, let it stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before slicing.
Tips: To toast coconut, bake on a sheet pan in a 350 degree oven until golden brown, 4 to 7 minutes, stirring halfway through.
To make the crust by hand, whisk the dry ingredients, then cut the butter into it using a pastry cutter or your fingers until fine crumbs form. Mix in the egg and vanilla until a ball of dough forms.
Coffee and Maple Chess Pie
By Vaughn Vreeland
This pie is like enjoying maple-soaked pancakes with a cup of coffee, but it’s great any time of day. A hint of bourbon, or vanilla if you please, enhances a custardy chess pie base that’s then topped with a slightly sweetened espresso-infused whipped cream. Candied orange, while optional, makes for an especially festive, sparkly finish. You can make the chess pie up to a day ahead of time and store it tightly wrapped at room temperature if it’s not topped with the whipped cream.
Yield: 8 servings
Total time: 2 hours 15 minutes, plus 1 1/2 hours’ cooling
Ingredients:
For the Crust:
1 round Laminated Pie Dough
All-purpose flour, for dusting
For the Buttermilk Filling:
4 large eggs, at room temperature
1/3 cup/67 grams granulated sugar
2/3 cup/210 grams maple syrup
8 tablespoons/113 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1/3 cup/78 grams buttermilk
1 tablespoon bourbon or vanilla extract
1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1/2 teaspoon fine salt
1/4 cup/40 grams fine cornmeal
For the Espresso Whipped Cream:
1 cup/240 grams heavy cream
2 tablespoons powdered sugar
2 teaspoons instant espresso
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1/8 teaspoon fine salt
Candied orange strips, cut into thin slivers, for garnishing (optional)
Preparation:
1. Parbake the crust: Rap the dough lightly if it’s stiff from the refrigerator. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough on a floured surface into a 12-inch round. Fit the dough into a 9-inch pie plate, letting it slump into the center, taking care not to stretch it. If needed, trim the overhang so it extends 1/2 inch past the rim. Fold the overhang under itself to form a thick ridge flush with the rim. Crimp the ridge.
2. Use a fork to poke holes on the bottom of the crust, and freeze for about 20 minutes, until firm.
3. Heat oven to 425 degrees with racks in the center and lowest position. Line the firm dough with foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and bake on the center rack for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and weights, lower the temperature to 350 degrees and bake for 20 minutes, until golden brown all over. Let cool completely.
4. Make the filing: In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and granulated sugar until smooth. Add the syrup, butter, buttermilk, bourbon and salt and whisk until incorporated. Whisk in the cornmeal and immediately pour the mixture into the cooled crust.
5. Bake on the bottom rack at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes, until the top is light golden brown and the edges are set but the center is still slightly jiggly. Cool completely at room temperature. You can store the untopped pie tightly wrapped at room temperature for up to a day.
6. Make the cream: Using a hand mixer and large bowl or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the heavy cream, powdered sugar, instant espresso and salt until medium-stiff to stiff peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Spread the cream over the top of the cooled pie, decoratively spiral if desired, and top with candied orange peel. Or instead of spreading the cream on top, you can serve it alongside the pie. Serve immediately. The topped pie will keep refrigerated for up to 4 days.
Pomegranate Cardamom Apple Pie
By Vaughn Vreeland
Like most good things, terrific apple pie takes a little bit of time, but it’s worth the anticipation. In this variation, sweet and tart apples are cooked first in a fragrant, jewel-toned pomegranate reduction so they all bake more evenly. Placing the pie on the bottom rack ensures that the bottom crust cooks through before the top crust gets too dark. You may be tempted to cut into it warm, but the pie needs to cool for at least four hours to be sliceable.
Yield: 8 servings
Total time: 2 hours 40 minutes, plus 4 hours’ cooling
Ingredients:
For the Filling:
1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup/294 grams pomegranate juice
1 tablespoon lemon zest (from 2 lemons)
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1/4 teaspoon fine salt
6 apples, such as Honeycrisp and Granny Smith (about 2 3/4 pounds; see Tip below), peeled, cored and sliced 1/2-inch thick
For the Topping:
2 tablespoons coarse sugar (such as turbinado)
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 tablespoon heavy cream, for brushing the dough
For the Crust:
2 rounds Laminated Pie Dough
All-purpose flour, for dusting
Preparation:
1. Make the filling: In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, whisk together the granulated sugar and cornstarch. Add the pomegranate juice, lemon zest and juice, ginger, cardamom and salt, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking often. Lower the heat to medium and continue to cook for about 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened to the consistency of molasses.
2. Add the apples and stir to coat all the slices evenly in the sauce. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring often, until the apples start to soften. Remove from the heat and let cool completely. To cool the mixture more quickly, spread it evenly on a rimmed baking sheet.
3. Prepare the topping: In a small bowl, mix together the coarse sugar and cardamom and set aside. Heat oven to 400 degrees with a rack in the lowest position.
4. Prepare the crust: Remove dough rounds from the refrigerator and allow to sit at room temperature for 5 minutes. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll one round of dough on a floured surface into a 12-inch circle. Fit the dough into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate, letting it slump into the center, taking care not to stretch it. Refrigerate the dough in the plate. Repeat the rolling process with the remaining round of dough, rolling it into a 16-inch circle. Using a knife or a pizza wheel, cut the round into 2-inch-wide strips of dough.
5. Assemble the pie: Fill the pie shell with the cooled filling and spread evenly. To create a lattice, lay half of the dough strips vertically over the top of the filling, leaving a scant 1/2 inch between each strip. Carefully fold every other strip upward away from you so that most of the filling it covered is now exposed. Lay one strip horizontally across the vertical strips and bring the folded strips back down the length of the pie, so that the horizontal strip weaves under and over every other vertical strip of dough. Repeat this process with the other vertical strips you did not fold, and alternate this process until the lattice is complete.
6. Trim any excess dough so a half inch hangs over the lip of the plate. Fold the overhang inward and crimp. At this point, if your dough is too soft, freeze the pie for about 10 minutes. Lightly brush the edges and the lattice with heavy cream and sprinkle with the cardamom sugar.
7. Place on a rimmed baking sheet lined with foil and bake on the lowest rack for 15 minutes. Lower the temperature to 350 degrees and bake for an additional hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, until the top is deep golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Cool completely to room temperature, at least 4 hours, before slicing and serving. The pie will keep at room temperature for up to 3 days, but is freshest day-of.
Tip: A mixture of firm apples that are both tart and sweet work best for baking: Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, Braeburn, Pink Lady and Golden Delicious are preferred.
Laminated Pie Dough
By Vaughn Vreeland
Wonderful pie crust requires only a couple of ingredients and tricks to ensure it’s extra flaky and tender. This dough is hydrated with ice water and apple cider vinegar, which helps prevent a tough, chewy crust. Quartering the dough and stacking it before rolling yields many flaky layers, giving you a shortcut version of laminated pastry. This recipe makes enough dough for two crusts: freeze the extra round of dough, if you’re not using it, for up to 4 months. When you’re ready to use it, thaw it, wrapped, overnight in the refrigerator.
Yield: 2 rounds of dough for 9-inch crusts
Total time: 30 minutes, plus 2 hours’ chilling
Ingredients:
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2/3 cup/115 grams ice water
3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons/28 grams sugar
2 teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1 teaspoon fine salt
1 1/4 cups/285 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes
Preparation:
1. In a liquid measuring cup, add the vinegar to the ice water. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar and salt. Add the butter and gently flatten some of the larger pieces with your hands as you massage them into the flour. You want some pieces about the size of a marble, and some small and flat. Larger pieces create flakes in the crust while smaller pieces make it tender.
2. Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in about 1/2 cup of the icy vinegar water. Using a fork, gently work the flour into the water until it is mostly hydrated, adding more liquid if needed. Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and gently knead it together a few times until the unincorporated bits of flour begin to disappear. Some floury bits are OK.
3. Press the dough into a square, about 1 1/2 inches thick, and cut into quarters. Stack 2 of the quarters on top of one another (place the others to the side) and gently press into another square about 1 1/2 inches thick. Slice that into quarters again, and stack those 4 quarters on top of one another. Form that stack into a round and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Use a rolling pin to gently roll over the covered dough round to flatten it out into a round about 1 1/2 inches thick. Repeat this process with the remaining two quarters. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days until ready to use.

The Chewy, Multicolored Cluster That Has Garnered a Cult Following: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: How does a candy brand that was started 40 years ago suddenly become one of the most popular treats in America, with a cult following, a Super Bowl ad and TikTok fame?
The answer lies at the center of a chewy ball rolled in smaller, crunchier balls. In other words, Nerds Gummy Clusters.
In 2018, a group of scientists developed a plan to make Nerds relevant again, according to Anna Walsh Olsen, head of research and development at Ferrara Candy Company. The colorful pebbles had long been on store shelves, but their popularity was lagging behind hits like Sour Patch Kids, and other, less messy treats like Starburst candies and Skittles were favored by some customers.
"What is the right amount of chewiness, crunchiness and flavor delivery that is really optimal for consumers?" the scientists wondered, according to Ms. Olsen.
For six months, a team of candy scientists and developers at the company's headquarters in Chicago met almost every day on their quest to create a gummy core that could hold just enough mini Nerds to pack a perfect crunch. A previous Nerds product had been made in hopes of solving that issue -- Nerds Rope, a long, gummy rope with Nerds stuck to it -- but some had found it messy or difficult to eat.
Enter: Nerds Gummy Clusters.
The effort seems to have worked. In 2018, Nerds products brought in $ 40 million in sales. In the past calendar year, the company said, that number jumped to $ 800 million, a 20-fold increase in about six years. The company declined to specify its profits. The new product's following also led to the first Super Bowl ad in Ferrara's history, and the company said it planned to release a second Super Bowl ad in 2025.
In 1983, the Willy Wonka Candy Company invented Nerds, the small, tart, crunchy candies that are found in pink-and-purple cardboard boxes and gobbled in loose handfuls. The candy was novel at the time and remains popular in fun-size containers on Halloween. About two decades later, Nestlé, which bought the Wonka candy company in 1988, made the Nerds Rope, hoping to attract customers who preferred a gummy-esque candy.
In 2018, Ferrara acquired Nestlé's U.S. sugar confectionery business and set out to transform Nerds from a brand "that was not very high in consumer's consideration" to a household staple, said Katie Duffy, the vice president of global brands and Ferrara Candy Company.
The company saw flaws in the Nerds Rope. It was popular, but it was messy to eat, Ms. Duffy said. Nerds tumbled off the gummy twine when customer took a bite. The Rope was also awkward to eat on the go and the texture could be more satisfyingly toothy.
Gummy Clusters seemed to be the answer. A factory in the Chicago suburb of Forest Park, Ill., where many are made, looks like a multicolor dream world fit for Willy Wonka. Melted gel -- slightly different than the kind used in Nerds Rope -- gets poured into molds to create small, chewy orbs with a gummy bear-esque consistency. Then, in a stainless steel bowl that looks like a massive KitchenAid with a metal mixing paddle, dots of sugar are spun in a process called panning until "baby Nerds," smaller than the original candy, are created.
Finally, the two forms meet, and the gummy balls are sent tumbling through a river of baby Nerds until they are completely coated in the colorful, crunchy dots.
At first, the idea of the Nerds Gummy Cluster got mixed reviews in conceptual consumer testing trials, Ms. Duffy said. But the company took "the risk to press ahead," she said, and in 2020 launched the new product in stores.
And in January 2021, one particular customer got her hands on a bag.
"These?? NERDS Gummy Clusters??? This is next level."
That customer was Kylie Jenner, a mogul, a model and the youngest Kardashian-Jenner sister. She shared her rave review in an Instagram story that essentially served as free advertising directed at the more than 200 million followers she had at the time.
"Obsessed," she whispered.
With that one review, the candy received its "first big hit," Ms. Duffy said. Nerds saw "an immediate spike" in Google searches after Ms. Jenner's post and sales "took off like a rocket ship," she said. The more people tried them, the more TikTok cameras started rolling.
"If you haven't tried these yet, you should go get yourself a bag, because they're unreal," one user posted on the app in 2021. Since then, thousands of videos have been posted by accounts big and small, generating millions of views and, for Ferrara, free advertisements.
Some reviews simply praise the candy while others are sillier. Nerds Gummy Clusters are "like kibble for people with A.D.H.D.," a TikToker quipped. "My wife left me because I was spending so much money on gummy clusters but I honestly do not care," a Reddit user joked (hopefully).
There are also videos -- horrifying to some purists -- of people ripping off the Nerds coating, leaving behind just the gummy core.
Then, in 2024, the Nerds Gummy Cluster went from a gamble that was being marketed in part by word of mouth, to being showcased on a national stage in Ferrara's first Super Bowl ad. In a 30-second spot, a gummy blob danced to Irene Cara's "Flashdance ... What a Feeling" before it was covered in Nerds raining from the sky. The camera zoomed out to a live-action scene and the gummy cluster became a snack for Addison Rae, one of the world's biggest TikTokers.
(The company said it was planning another Nerds Gummy Clusters ad for the upcoming Super Bowl, but it did not share details.)
Even a widely shared video showing that some Nerds Gummy Clusters are colored with carmine, a common food dye made from crushed bugs, seemed to have little impact on its more than 32 million viewers.
"So what I'm hearing is ... candy has protein, so I should eat more," read one user's comment with nearly 200,000 likes.
On a recent Friday, Mitchell Cohen, the owner of Economy Candy on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, hauled a five-pound bag of Nerds Gummy Clusters up to the counter.
Handing out king-size chocolate bars used to be the way to become the popular house on Halloween, Mr. Cohen said. This year, however, the hot trick-or-treat item was fun-size bags of Nerds Gummy Clusters.
"We know kids are going to love it," Mr. Cohen said. "Someone would rather get a pack or two of Nerds Clusters than their 700th mini Kit Kat."

Scallions Can Cut the Smell and Stress of Cooking Fish: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Concerned about odors and splatters? This simple dinner, infused with a silky scallion oil, is ready to allay any worries.
If you live in a small space, the lure of crispy fish skin -- the bacon of the sea -- can lead to fishy pillow cases until laundry day. (Totally worth it.)
But a fish dinner doesn't have to be defined by a hard sear in a pan, oil splatter all over your stovetop, kitchen counter and clothes. For nights when you want something gentler on the cook (and the fish), you can turn to this oil-poaching method, which turns out the most flavorful, tender fillets imbued with the deep savoriness of scallions.
Recipe: Scallion-Oil Fish
Cooking fish at home always begins at the store. You may already know the secret to great fish for dinner is getting to know your fishmonger, who not just sells the fish but also knows when it came in and where from. Fostering this connection is the best way to establish your own relationship to cooking fish.
"A fresh fish should have an ocean-like scent, not a strong fishy odor," said Chris Addis, an owner of Fish Tales, a seafood market in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, adding that any skin "should be glistening and moist." For this recipe, you may lean toward cod, halibut, black sea bass, haddock, flounder, tilapia or even lemon sole. But take Mr. Addis's advice and grab whichever looks and smells the freshest that day.
Rather than fry that fish on high once you're home, nestle a few fillets into a pan of hot, flavored oil. Simmering sliced scallions in olive oil over gentle heat removes their moisture, crisping them and concentrating their savoriness. In turn, the oil will be tinted a vibrant Chartreuse and perfumed with a scallion aroma. At this point, you can turn off the flame. The residual heat from that oil will softly poach the fish, leaving you with the silkiest texture -- low splatter, low smell and low stress.
Think of the scallion oil, called pa gireum in Korean, as both cooking medium and irresistible sauce. If you're a scallion fiend, you could even double the scallions and oil, and reserve half before cooking the fish for future uses beyond this simple meal: say, for frying eggs or eggplants, for whisking into vinaigrettes and for roasting vegetables.
Though this method doesn't yield crisp skin, the pile of crunchy fried scallions in the pan, eaten with the tender white fish, is a worthwhile compromise. Be sure to dip crusty bread into that glorious scallion oil, and rest easy knowing that this lovely fish will linger in your dreams, not on your pillow.

Full text: The greening of Seattle's commercial waterfront could not happen until a blighting highway was ripped down and a crumbling sea wall replaced.
Impatient ice skaters await the replacement for the Lasker Rink and Pool in Central Park, and its restored setting. Called the Harlem Meer Center, it is the largest restoration ever undertaken by the Central Park Conservancy.
At Olana, the home of the 19th-century Hudson River painter Frederic Church, a painstaking restoration has brought back the artist's lost Romantic landscape.
The venerable Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania's Brandywine Valley has "reimagined" itself with a playfully swaying greenhouse rising from a shallow pool. It opens as 200 acres of outdoor displays settle into winter slumber.
This is a golden age for parks, with cities sprucing up waterfronts, transforming abandoned industrial sites and bringing some green space to neighborhoods where treeless cracked-asphalt sports courts are the rule.
These eagerly awaited, high-ambition park and garden projects will open when trees are bare and people are choosing indoor pursuits. If this seems counterintuitive, consider that each took more than a decade to come to fruition and navigated construction complications and supply-chain delays. Opening at the perfect moment wasn't an option. All will offer distinctive experiences to the intrepid cold-weather patron -- and will be visitor-tested by the time crowds flock in the spring and summer.
Seattle's Waterfront Park, a 'New Front Porch'
Visitors and locals already swarm a new promenade hugging Seattle's downtown commercial shoreline, where beefy wood-framed wharves alternate with vistas across Elliott Bay. They dodge construction fences and heavy equipment, as a line of trees and dense plantings come together, interwoven with bike lanes, quiet shaded paths, stormwater-filtering bioswales, and public artwork (much of which tells stories of Indigenous tribes).
There's even a recreated natural beach, restoring the kind of gravelly shoreline where Coast Salish tribes harvested shellfish and salmon.
James Corner, founder of Field Operations, the landscape architecture firm that designed Waterfront Park, calls it a "new front porch" for the city. The firm has been dodging regulation and construction contingencies since 2010.
In part the crowds are celebrating the waterfront's emergence from the shadow of the fume- and noise-spewing Alaskan Way Viaduct, which formed a highway barrier that Seattleites reviled since its construction in the 1950s. Its 2019 demolition made room for the promenade.
Though the full 20 acres won't open until early spring, an acrobatic section of the park welcomed the public Oct. 4. The Overlook Walk rises in a pair of curved stairways where the promenade takes a sharp turn inland around a new Ocean Pavilion serving the Seattle Aquarium. As visitors ascend a 110-foot bluff, culminating at the city's famous Pike Place Market, vistas of downtown skyscrapers and the cranes of the container port open up, as does a moody expanse of Puget Sound (now increasingly referred to as the Salish Sea) that even on an inevitable gray day can offer views of mist-wrapped islands and mountains below a pewter plane of clouds. (Elevators serve the mobility-challenged and those who think only fitness fanatics would climb so many stairs.)
Marshall Foster, who heads Seattle Center, the park's operating entity, and who has worn a number of hats during the 15-year project, called it a multibillion-dollar infrastructure rebuild led by the landscape design. The viaduct had to come down, a $ 3.3 billion replacement tunnel had to be bored, and a tangle of aging utilities needed to be rebuilt before the $ 781 million park could begin construction. The first phase replaced the waterfront's sea wall, into which Field Operations scribed niches to encourage colonization by harbor species friendly to migrating juvenile salmon. It works, according to University of Washington researchers.
The city's civic and business leaders think -- or desperately hope -- that the park crowds will spread into downtown's commercial core, which is still too quiet, because of years of remote work. Foster is an optimist. "Though the Waterfront Park was in the pipeline well before the pandemic," he said, "it has preloaded a shot in the arm for downtown."
An Oval Pool Restores the Harlem Meer
The Loula D. Lasker skating rink and swimming pool was Central Park's most jarring addition, a concrete flying saucer that looked as if it crash landed in a ravine at the edge of the Harlem Meer, the picturesque lake that meanders across much of the park's northern edge. At its 1966 opening, the New York Times's architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable let 'er rip, calling it "an oppressively jazzed-up military installation of sawtooth-trimmed concrete." It also leaked from the beginning.
Now a $ 160 million replacement, named the Gottesman Pool and Rink, is coming to completion and will open in the first quarter of 2025 for skating.
Susan T. Rodriguez, who heads her own architecture firm (working with Mitchell Giurgola), stretched the round pool into an oval and tucked it into the eastern slope of the ravine, tight against the park drive. The new pool, with a shallow slope at one end to invite children and people with disabilities, can be covered with an artificial turf lid; the rink goes on top. The lid extends the usefulness of the facility. Lasker was only used two months for swimming and four months for skating.
The contractor has been placing several feet of soil atop the roof of the 30,000-square-foot Davis Center, a building containing concessions, changing rooms and equipment. The soil supports plantings that will make the building largely invisible to the hordes of cyclists that whiz around it on the East Park Drive. The Conservancy's landscape architects, led by Christopher Nolan, have shaped sloping planted areas around the edge of the new rink so that it nestles near to -- rather than bulges into -- the Meer. "The goal was to emphasize the landscape experience" for visitors, "rather than using landscape to soften the impact of the building as an object," Nolan said in an email.
As a bonus, the trimmer new footprint makes room for the restoration of a lost mini-estuary. A stream flows north from the Pool in a series of ponds and waterfalls braided with paths through the North Woods Ravine, then spills through the picturesquely stacked boulders of the Huddlestone Arch beneath the park drive. The Lasker rink, by damming the ravine and confronting path users with a high wall and untidy service area, had forced the stream into a pipe.
Now it is reopened to daylight, with its boulder-strewn course running along the west side of the rink-pool. The view from the arch will unfold as the original designers, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, intended, with the spreading of the stream into the calm surface of the Meer framed by trees.
The Conservancy has just delayed the rink-pool opening until April, when the full scope of the project -- which includes the Meer Center and other park projects north of 97th Street Street and cost a total of $ 310 million -- will begin revealing itself, as water-loving plants edging the Meer invite turtles and egrets. Largely native trees and shrubs will complete the softly Romantic landscape silhouette the designers intended.
Church's Romantic Vision Reconstructed at Olana
Among the most striking historic sites in the Hudson River Valley is Olana, the polychromed masonry pile built atop a high hill by Frederic Edwin Church (1826-1900), among the most beloved painters of the 19th-century Hudson River School. Its exotic architecture, dubbed "Persian Gothic" by the art historian John Wilmerding, hosts Orientalist interiors featuring paintings by Church as well as other art and decorative objects.
From the house's numerous vantages, Church could gaze upon and paint the Hudson River as it curved lazily around the property to the southwest. He captured roiling clouds above the river and lurid sunsets behind the tree-carpeted slopes and sharp peaks of the Catskill Mountains that march into the distance.
Though the house and its breathtaking views have been the primary draw, many of the 250 acres that Church acquired around the hilltop and turned into an idealized Romantic landscape have now been restored.
Beginning in 1860, Church bought land that had been denuded of vegetation for timber and subsistence farms. Over decades, he "planted trees by the thousands," explained Sean Sawyer, president of the Olana Partnership, the nonprofit stewardship entity that operates this New York State historic site.
He shaped his new forest to frame meadows that opened vistas to hilltops and other picturesque natural landmarks. He dug a pond which visitors encounter as they begin the ascent to the house. He connected the meadows he planted with carriage trails that gently wind up the steep slopes. He would paint and sketch from the vantages he had constructed and shared these idealized places with visitors.
Though the house was designed by Church and Vaux, who was working at that time with Olmsted (Church's fourth cousin) on Central Park, "the landscape was entirely engineered by Church," Sawyer said on a tour. He united the house and its setting as an "artistic environment, a total work of art."
The problem in 2015, when a master plan was drawn up by the landscape architecture firm Nelson Byrd Woltz, was that Church's work had largely vanished due to neglect. The meadows had been obliterated by invasive tree growth.
"Our task was to physically re-establish Church's intentions," said Thomas Woltz, the senior principal. With painstaking research and projects undertaken over years, visitors can again appreciate most of Church's constructed natural world. "The idea is that no one would know we had been there," Woltz added.
A new Frederic Church Center for Art and Landscape also welcomes visitors at the site's edge. Interpretive displays will acquaint visitors with features they may have overlooked in the past, such as the bucolic cluster of farm structures that Church called the Ferme Ornée.
The firm Architecture Research Office (ARO) has designed the visitor center as a low, barn-red, wood-framed pavilion, hidden from Church's vistas and invisible beyond Olana's borders.
A stone stair ascends from the center to a tiny clearing framed by trees. There a reclaimed view unfolds across the pond, up a meadow and through a gap to the grand house rising from the hilltop. Church, Woltz observed, "leads you upward to seduce you with this vista."
Longwood Gardens Reimagined Under Rippling Glass
Inspired by the glass houses of Philadelphia's 1876 Centennial Exposition, Pierre S. du Pont, the longtime chairman of the company then called E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., spared no expense when he founded Longwood Gardens in the 1920s. It is a 200-acre display garden that includes a conservatory complex, thematic exhibits, topiaries, a 600-jet water-fountain garden and a meadow inspired by Andrew Wyeth paintings. It lies within larger holdings totaling 1,000 acres in the Brandywine Valley at the southeastern corner of Pennsylvania.
The palatial formality of Longwood's famous conservatories, where visitors walk around large, densely planted set pieces pierced by flowing water, contrasts with the immersive new West Conservatory that subtly dips, kinking a bit to one side, seeming almost to shimmy. It floats atop a reflecting pool. That's quite an act for a 32,000-square-foot greenhouse.
There is a method to the apparent oddness of this centerpiece of "Longwood Reimagined," a $ 250 million project that adds several new attractions to the greenhouse core as well as a restaurant that opens toward the fountain garden and its choreographed water spectacles.
The saw-toothed profile of the new conservatory shapes subtly warping bays that vary in height from 15 to 48 feet. Supporting columns rise, then curl like unfurling fronds, to support the glass roof. The intention of this manipulation of the conventionally symmetrical botanic greenhouse, said Marion Weiss, co-founder of the architecture firm Weiss/Manfredi, is to "taper some perspectives and open others up."
In the West Conservatory, visitors find themselves immersed in permanent and changing plantings native to Mediterranean climates worldwide, orchestrated by the landscape architect Reed Hilderbrand.
The conservatory extends the visitor itinerary that moves westward from the original greenhouse complex but used to end abruptly at a traditional waterlily court. Weiss/Manfredi restored this court and used it to frame a close-up view of the new building behind a scrim of ginkgo trees.
Other elements of the "Reimagined" project are tucked around the glass house. A diminutive greenhouse encloses the Cascade Garden, a painstaking reconstruction of the stylish little tropical rainforest conjured by the beloved Brazilian Modernist landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx. A similarly intimate garden court, screened by hedges, hosts a bonsai collection. Weiss's co-founder, Michael Manfredi, describes the informal arrangement of these attractions as "a checkerboard of gardens and crystal pavilions."
Hilderbrand draws the eye to a stand of London plane trees given pride of place on a grassy rise. They front a Brandywine Valley meadow view that seems infinite.
"Creating beauty and bringing joy to people through the gardens we share -- that's what we do," explained Paul Redman, Longwood's chief executive. Its expansion opens Nov. 22, past the time when outdoor gardens die back. "It's our slowest season," Redman said, "but now we offer almost five acres of gardens under glass."

In the airport terminal, two different grab-and-go snacks may appeal to travelers rushing to catch their flights: One is a candy bar, wrapped in chocolate and caramel. The other is also a bar wrapped in chocolate and caramel, but it's "high in protein."
If that promise of protein has ever influenced your purchase, the "health halo" may have been at work. The term refers to a phenomenon where people may perceive a food product (or drink or supplement) as healthy based on a single claim -- even if the snack is not-so-angelic.
"Health halo" borrows from "halo effect," a cognitive bias where people perceive someone or something in an overall positive way based on a single trait. (A well-used example: assuming a physically attractive person is also kind.)
A single claim (think "low calorie" or "organic") emblazoned on a package, or a nutritious-sounding ingredient in large font, can do the heavy lifting for a food brand. The claim may be true, but that doesn't mean the product is healthy: The sugar content of a protein bar, for example, may rival that of a candy bar. Still, the halo has cast a good-for-you glow over the North American protein bar market, which, according to one estimate, could grow to over $ 11 billion by 2030.
/hĕlth hā-lō/
The Food and Drug Administration has some regulations around food labeling. The agency will review an assertion that, say, a bar of dark chocolate could lower blood pressure. But food manufacturers can persuade shoppers with nods and winks.
They've been winking for a while, because research suggests it works. For example, one study from 2016 found that people were more likely to think bags of chips were healthier, and buy them, when they were "vitamin-fortified" -- even when they were worse dietary decisions.
"If the marketing is well done, it slips below the radar of critical thinking," said Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University. "If you're in a supermarket and it's got vitamins, it's no G.M.O., it's organic, no artificial sweetener, no sugar added -- all of those have the same kind of effect: unconscious, subliminal, emotional."
But some consumers are challenging claims: Last year, three plaintiffs filed a class action complaint against PepsiCo, arguing that it had created a "deceptive health halo" around its Gatorade protein bars, including by marketing the bars as science-backed tools to "help muscles rebuild." A federal judge ruled in August that the lawsuit against PepsiCo could proceed.
So many decisions around what to eat come down to impulse buys -- and those choices are often made in the haze of the health halo.

Spending Stays Hot, Signaling Strong Growth: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A new report showing a rise in retail sales in September indicates that consumer spending, a key engine of economic growth, remains robust.
Shoppers spent more than expected on a wide range of goods last month, a sign that consumer demand, the engine of U.S. economic growth, remains solid.
Retail sales, which are not adjusted for inflation, rose 0.4 percent in September from the previous month, slightly ahead of economists' expectations, the Census Bureau reported on Thursday. Sales, excluding cars and gasoline, which can be more indicative of underlying trends, rose 0.7 percent, far ahead of forecasts.
"The September growth is a positive sign for the overall economy considering the pressure on consumers' wallets due to persistently high prices," said Mickey Chadha, a vice president at Moody's Ratings.
Inflation has been cooling, but the past spike in prices continues to weigh on consumers. The labor market has held up, with 254,000 jobs added in September, helping to drive wage growth.
"The underlying trend in consumer spending remains strong," Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a note. A resilient job market and declining interest rates are likely to bolster consumer spending in the coming year, he said.
Federal Reserve policymakers cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years at their meeting last month, and projected gradually lower rates in the coming months. Mary C. Daly, the president of the San Francisco Fed, said on Tuesday that the central bank should keep cutting rates even if the economy is robust, as long as inflation continues to cool.
Executives at consumer-facing companies have recently expressed some caution about the state of consumers.
Laurent Freixe, the chief executive of Nestlé, told analysts on Thursday that consumer demand has been "subdued" across the food giant's operations in recent months, with particular softening in the Americas and Europe. Last week, PepsiCo lowered its annual sales growth forecast, which Ramon Laguarta, the company's chief executive, attributed to weaker consumer spending as a result of inflation and higher interest rates over the past few years.
Matthew Shay, the chief executive of the National Retail Federation, said on a call with reporters this week that he expected consumers to be price-conscious and pragmatic during the holiday shopping season, a crucial period for retailers.
Big-ticket purchases like furniture, electronics and appliances were among the few weak spots in the retail sales report, recording declines in September.
The National Retail Federation said it expected holiday sales this year to be in line with the 3.6 percent annual increases that were typical before the coronavirus pandemic. The economy "looks much more like a prepandemic economy in terms of the spending patterns and the growth," Mr. Shay said.

On Sept. 17, 2014, an ambitious new app made its debut: New York Times Cooking, which collected thousands of archival Times recipes in one elegantly designed, easy-to-use place.
In the 10 years since, Cooking has grown into a whole universe of food, videos, personalities, newsletters, cookbooks and comments — with readers at its center. You’ve invited us into your kitchens and made us part of your lives.
To mark the anniversary, here are 25 of our best recipes according to you, our community. It’s not a ranked list of our most popular recipes by traffic numbers alone, but a wider, more curated view of NYT Cooking.
These are dishes that have emerged as classics and racked up 5-star ratings, recipes that became popular just about immediately after we hit publish, went viral on social media and inspired the most memorable comments. But we easily could’ve filled this list with 500 more. There are so many you’ve loved, in so many ways. — KRYSTEN CHAMBROT

THE ICONS
C lassics old and new
Buttermilk-Brined Roast Chicken
By Samin Nosrat, published in 2017
This recipe, adapted from Samin Nosrat’s “Salt Fat Acid Heat,” is inspired by the Southern grandma method of marinating chicken overnight in buttermilk before frying it. You’re roasting here, but the buttermilk and salt still work like a brine, tenderizing the meat on multiple levels to yield an unbelievably juicy chicken. As an added bonus, the sugars in the buttermilk will caramelize, contributing to an exquisitely browned skin. Be sure to leave 24 hours for marinating the chicken. While the beauty of roast chicken is that you can serve it anytime, anywhere, try serving it alongside panzanella, which plays the role of starch, salad and sauce.
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: About 1 3/4 hours, plus overnight marinating
Ingredients:
1 chicken, 3 1/2 to 4 pounds
Kosher salt or fine sea salt
2 cups buttermilk
Preparation:
1. The day before you want to cook the chicken, remove the wingtips by cutting through the first wing joint with poultry shears or a sharp knife. Reserve for stock. Season chicken generously with salt and let it sit for 30 minutes.
2. Stir 2 tablespoons kosher salt or 4 teaspoons fine sea salt into the buttermilk to dissolve. Place the chicken in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag and pour in the buttermilk. (If the chicken won’t fit in a gallon-size bag, double up 2 plastic produce bags to prevent leaks and tie the bag with twine.)
3. Seal the bag, squish the buttermilk all around the chicken, place on a rimmed plate, and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours. If you’re so inclined, you can turn the bag periodically so every part of the chicken gets marinated, but that’s not essential.
4. Pull the chicken from the fridge an hour before you plan to cook it. Heat the oven to 425 degrees with a rack set in the center position.
5. Remove the chicken from the plastic bag and scrape off as much buttermilk as you can without being obsessive. Tightly tie together the legs with a piece of butcher’s twine. Place the chicken in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet or a shallow roasting pan.
6. Slide the pan all the way to the back of the oven on the center rack. Rotate the pan so that the legs are pointing toward the rear left corner and the breast is pointing toward the center of the oven. (The back corners tend to be the hottest spots in the oven, so this orientation protects the breast from overcooking before the legs are done.) Pretty quickly you should hear the chicken sizzling.
7. After about 20 minutes, when the chicken starts to brown, reduce the heat to 400 degrees and continue roasting for 10 minutes.
8. Move the pan so the legs are facing the rear right corner of the oven. Continue cooking for another 30 minutes or so, until the chicken is brown all over and the juices run clear when you insert a knife down to the bone between the leg and the thigh. If the skin is getting too brown before it is cooked through, use a foil tent. Remove it to a platter and let it rest for 10 minutes before carving and serving.
Shakshuka With Feta
By Melissa Clark, published in 2013
Shakshuka may be at the apex of eggs-for-dinner recipes, though in Israel it is breakfast food, a bright, spicy start to the day with a pile of pita or challah served on the side. (It also makes excellent brunch or lunch food.) It’s a one-skillet recipe of eggs baked in a tomato-red pepper sauce spiced with cumin, paprika and cayenne. First you make that sauce, which comes together fairly quickly on top of the stove, then you gently crack each of the eggs into the pan, nestling them into the sauce. The pan is moved into the oven to finish. Shakshuka originated in North Africa, and like many great dishes there are as many versions as there are cooks who have embraced it. This one strays from more traditional renditions by adding crumbled feta cheese, which softens into creamy nuggets in the oven’s heat.
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
Total time: 50 minutes
Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 large onion, halved and thinly sliced
1 large red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon sweet paprika
1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne, or to taste
1 (28-ounce) can whole plum tomatoes with their juices, coarsely chopped
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed
1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more as needed
5 ounces feta, crumbled (about 1 1/4 cups)
6 large eggs
Chopped cilantro, for serving
Hot sauce, for serving
Preparation:
1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low. Add onion and bell pepper. Cook gently until very soft, about 20 minutes. Add garlic and cook until tender, 1 to 2 minutes; stir in cumin, paprika and cayenne, and cook 1 minute. Pour in tomatoes and season with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; simmer until tomatoes have thickened, about 10 minutes. Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed. Stir in crumbled feta.
2. Gently crack eggs into skillet over tomatoes. Season eggs with salt and pepper. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until eggs are just set, 7 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve with hot sauce.
No-Knead Bread
By Jim Lahey, adapted by Mark Bittman, published in 2006
Here is one of the most popular recipes the Times has ever published, courtesy of Jim Lahey, owner of Sullivan Street Bakery. It requires no kneading. It uses no special ingredients, equipment or techniques. And it takes very little effort — only time. You will need 24 hours to create the bread, but much of this is unattended waiting, a slow fermentation of the dough that results in a perfect loaf.
Yield: One 1 1/2-pound loaf
Total time: 1 hour 30 minutes, plus about 20 hours’ resting time
Ingredients:
3 1/3 cups/430 grams all-purpose or bread flour, plus more for dusting
Generous 1/4 teaspoon/1 gram instant yeast
2 teaspoons/8 grams kosher salt
Cornmeal or wheat bran, as needed
Preparation:
1. In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add 1 1/2 cups/345 grams water and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees.
2. Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.
3. Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.
4. At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is OK. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.
Red Lentil Soup
By Melissa Clark, published in 2008
This is a lentil soup that defies expectations of what lentil soup can be. Based on a Turkish lentil soup, mercimek corbasi, it is light, spicy and a bold red color (no murky brown here): a revelatory dish that takes less than an hour to make. The cooking is painless. Saute onion and garlic in oil, then stir in tomato paste, cumin and chile powder and cook a few minutes more to intensify flavor. Add broth, water, red lentils (which cook faster than their green or black counterparts) and diced carrot, and simmer for 30 minutes. Puree half the mixture and return it to the pot for a soup that strikes the balance between chunky and pleasingly smooth. A hit of lemon juice adds an up note that offsets the deep cumin and chile flavors.
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 45 minutes
Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling
1 large onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 teaspoon ground cumin
Salt and black pepper
Pinch of chili powder or ground cayenne, plus more to taste
1 quart chicken or vegetable broth
1 cup red lentils
1 large carrot, peeled and diced
Juice of 1/2 lemon, more to taste
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
Preparation:
1. In a large pot, heat 3 tablespoons oil over high until hot and shimmering. Add onion and garlic, and saute until golden, about 4 minutes.
2. Stir in tomato paste, cumin, 1/4 teaspoons each salt and black pepper and the chili powder, and saute for 2 minutes longer.
3. Add broth, 2 cups water, lentils and carrot. Bring to a simmer, then partly cover pot and turn heat to medium-low. Simmer until lentils are soft, about 30 minutes. Taste and add salt if necessary.
4. Using an immersion or regular blender or a food processor, puree half the soup, then add it back to pot. The soup should be somewhat chunky.
5. Reheat soup if necessary, then stir in lemon juice and cilantro. Serve soup drizzled with good olive oil and dusted lightly with chili powder, if desired.
Jollof Rice
By Yewande Komolafe, published in 2019
A successful batch of jollof rice requires a few key ingredients (tomatoes, peppers, onions, a few herbs, spices and some stock) and a perfect sauce-to-rice ratio, so the cooked grains remain separate. I have found that the best, no-fuss way to do this is in the oven. Jollof is typically made with long-grain rice, though in Nigeria, parboiled rice is the norm. Most jollof is prepared over an open flame or on a stovetop. Missing from this oven version is the slightly smoky flavor you get from the little bits of rice that have browned on the bottom of your pan, but that’s nothing a pinch of smoked paprika can’t fix. Serve with braised goat or other stewed meats, and a side of fried plantains.
Yield: 8 to 10 servings
Total time: 1 1/2 hours
Ingredients:
For the obe ata:
1 (14-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes with their juices
1 medium red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and roughly chopped
1/2 medium red onion, peeled and roughly chopped
4 garlic cloves, peeled
1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped
1 red habanero chile, stemmed
2 tablespoons canola or other neutral oil
For the jollof rice:
1/2 cup canola or other neutral oil
2 medium red onions, peeled, halved and thinly sliced
4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional)
3 cups parboiled long-grain rice (such as Carolina Gold or Uncle Ben’s Original), basmati or jasmine rice (about 1 1/4 pounds)
5 fresh thyme sprigs
1 fresh bay leaf
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 cups beef, chicken or vegetable stock
Preparation:
1. Prepare the obe ata: Working in batches if needed, combine all the obe ata ingredients except the canola oil in a blender and puree on high until smooth. The liquid from the can of tomatoes should suffice, but you can add up to 1/4 cup of water if necessary to get the puree going. (You should have about 3 cups of purée.)
2. Heat the 2 tablespoons canola oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high. Add the puree and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium, cover and simmer until the sauce is slightly reduced by about a third of its original volume, 18 to 20 minutes. (It should make about 2 cups. Obe ata can be cooled and refrigerated for up to 2 weeks, or frozen for up to 1 month.)
3. Prepare the rice: Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Heat the 1/2 cup canola oil in a large Dutch oven over medium until shimmering, about 1 minute. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove half the onions to a plate and set aside. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste, turmeric and smoked paprika, if using, and toast, stirring occasionally, until turmeric is fragrant and tomato paste has deepened to a dark red color, about 2 minutes.
4. Stir in the obe ata sauce and bring to a simmer over medium heat. The habanero oils love to disperse in the air, so you may want to turn on your stovetop fan or open a window while simmering the obe ata. Stir in the rice, thyme and bay leaf, and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the stock and cover with a lid. Transfer the pot to the oven and cook until rice is just tender, 35 minutes.
5. Remove the pot from the oven and let sit, covered (no peeking) for 15 minutes. Uncover, fluff the rice with a fork and stir in the reserved sauteed onions. Adjust seasoning, if necessary, and discard the thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Serve warm.
Original Plum Torte
By Marian Burros, published in 1983
The Times published Marian Burros’ recipe for Plum Torte every September from 1983 until 1989, when the editors determined that enough was enough. The recipe was to be printed for the last time that year. “To counter anticipated protests,” Burros wrote a few years later, “the recipe was printed in larger type than usual with a broken-line border around it to encourage clipping.” It didn’t help. The paper was flooded with angry letters. “The appearance of the recipe, like the torte itself, is bittersweet,” wrote a reader in Tarrytown, New York. “Summer is leaving, fall is coming. That’s what your annual recipe is all about. Don't be grumpy about it.” We are not! And we pledge that every year, as summer gives way to fall, we will make sure that the recipe is easily available to one and all. The original 1983 recipe called for 1 cup sugar; the 1989 version reduced that to 3/4 cup. We give both options below.
Yield: 8 servings
Total time: 1 hour 15 minutes
Ingredients:
3/4 to 1 cup sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup unbleached flour, sifted
1 teaspoon baking powder
Pinch of salt (optional)
2 eggs
24 halves pitted purple plums
Sugar, lemon juice and cinnamon, for topping
Preparation:
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Cream the sugar and butter in a bowl. Add the flour, baking powder, salt and eggs and beat well.
3. Spoon the batter into a springform pan of 8, 9 or 10 inches. Place the plum halves skin side up on top of the batter. Sprinkle lightly with sugar and lemon juice, depending on the sweetness of the fruit. Sprinkle with about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, depending on how much you like cinnamon.
4. Bake 1 hour, approximately. Remove and cool; refrigerate or freeze if desired. Or cool to lukewarm and serve plain or with whipped cream. (To serve a torte that was frozen, defrost and reheat it briefly at 300 degrees.)
TIP: To freeze, double-wrap the torte in foil, place in a plastic bag and seal.

THE SUPER STARS
Five-star recipes reviewed thousands of times
Strawberry Spoon Cake
By Jerrelle Guy, published in 2020
This unfussy cake with a top layer of jammy strawberries is so gooey it’s best to serve the whole thing with a spoon. The batter comes together quickly with minimal effort, using basic pantry ingredients and a small handful of berries — frozen or fresh. If you’re using frozen, be sure to defrost them in the microwave first. Extract as much juice as possible from the fruit by macerating and mashing it, so that it lends the cake additional moisture while baking. Add a dash of freshly ground cardamom or ground ginger on top before baking it off, if you like, or some ribbons of fresh basil once it’s hot out of the oven. Whatever embellishments you decide on, burrowing warm spoonfuls of this cake beside scoops of vanilla ice cream is the most important thing.
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 30 minutes, plus cooling
Ingredients:
1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted, plus more for greasing
5 ounces/145 grams frozen and thawed or fresh, hulled strawberries (about 1 cup)
2/3 cup/150 grams packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup/120 milliliters whole milk, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
Vanilla ice cream, for serving
Preparation:
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees and grease an 8-inch (square or round) baking dish with butter. Set aside.
2. Using your hands or the back of a fork, mash the berries to release all their juices, and stir in 1/3 cup of the brown sugar. Set aside.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the melted butter, remaining 1/3 cup brown sugar, milk and salt, then add the flour and baking powder and continue whisking just until the batter is smooth. Transfer the batter (it’s not much) to the greased baking dish, and spread evenly into corners.
4. Spoon the strawberries and all their juices over the top of the cake batter. Place in the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or just when a toothpick comes out clean in the center. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 3 to 5 minutes before spooning into bowls. Serve warm with ice cream.
Sheet-Pan Bibimbap
By Eric Kim, published in 2021
Bibimbap, the Korean mixed rice dish, is a kaleidoscope of flavors and textures. The popular dish has multiple origin stories and, like banchan and kimchi, many variations. Cooks who ordinarily keep namul (seasoned vegetable) banchan in the fridge may add them to a bowl with leftover rice and seasonings like spicy-sweet gochujang and nutty sesame oil, for example. Or, if starting their bibimbap from scratch, some may prep each component separately. But here’s a fun way to accomplish everything at once: Roast a melange of bits and bobs on one sheet pan as rice heats and eggs oven-fry on another. The caramelized sweet potato and salty kale in this formula come highly recommended, but you can use any vegetables on hand, reducing cook times for delicate options such as spinach, scallions or asparagus.
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 35 minutes
Ingredients:
6 ounces oyster mushrooms, torn into bite-size pieces
1 medium sweet potato (about 6 ounces), scrubbed and thinly sliced into half-moons
1 small red onion (about 6 ounces), thinly sliced crosswise into half-moons
3 packed cups coarsely chopped Tuscan or curly kale (from 1 small bunch)
6 tablespoons olive oil
Kosher salt and black pepper
4 cups cooked medium-grain white rice, preferably cold leftovers
4 large eggs
4 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, plus more to taste, for serving
4 teaspoons gochujang, plus more to taste, for serving
Kimchi, for serving (optional)
Preparation:
1. Position racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and heat oven to 450 degrees.
2. On a large sheet pan, arrange the mushrooms, sweet potato, red onion and kale into four separate quadrants. Drizzle the vegetables with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and toss to coat, keeping the types of vegetables separate. Try to not crowd the vegetables; you want them to brown, not steam. Roast on the top rack until the sweet potato is fork-tender, the onion and mushrooms are slightly caramelized and the kale is crispy but not burnt, 20 to 25 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, place another large sheet pan on the bottom rack to heat. When the vegetables are almost done cooking, in the last 5 minutes or so, remove the heated pan from the oven and evenly drizzle the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil on it. Spread the rice over half of the pan. Crack the eggs onto the other half and carefully transfer to the oven. Bake until the whites are just set and the yolks are still runny, 3 to 6 minutes (this time may vary depending on your oven, so watch it carefully).
4. To serve, divide the rice evenly among four bowls. Now divide the vegetables evenly as well, placing them in four neat piles over each portion of rice. Use a spatula to slide the eggs over the vegetables. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and dollop with 1 teaspoon of gochujang, adding more if desired. Mix everything together with a spoon or chopsticks before diving in, and serve kimchi alongside, if you prefer.
Chile Crisp Fettuccine Alfredo With Spinach
By Genevieve Ko, published in 2022
Swirling chile crisp, a popular Chinese condiment, and spinach into fettuccine Alfredo gives you an immensely satisfying meatless one-dish dinner. The firecracker crunch of chile crisp intensifies when sizzled in butter before cream tempers its heat. Parmesan heightens the sauce’s savory umami, and pregrated cheese works just fine here. This astoundingly simple meal — it doesn’t even require any chopping — comes together in under 30 minutes but tastes as complex as anything you’d get at a restaurant.
Yield: 6 servings
Total time: 25 minutes
Ingredients:
Salt
4 tablespoons butter
1 to 2 tablespoons chile crisp, plus more to taste (see tip)
1 cup heavy cream
1 pound dried fettuccine
1 (5-ounce) package baby spinach
3/4 cup finely grated Parmesan (2 1/4 ounces), plus more for serving
Preparation:
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. While the water heats, melt the butter with the chile crisp in a very large skillet or Dutch oven over low heat.
2. Whisk in the cream and keep warm over low. (It should steam, not bubble.)
3. Cook the fettuccine until al dente according to the package directions. Use tongs to transfer the noodles to the cream mixture, reserving the pasta water.
4. Add the spinach and turn with tongs until the noodles are well coated.
5. Add the Parmesan and toss, still over low heat, until the noodles are slicked with a creamy sauce, adding a spoonful or two of pasta water if needed to loosen the sauce. Divide among serving dishes and top with Parmesan and more chile crisp, if you’d like. Serve immediately.
TIP: You can make chile crisp easily at home or buy it in supermarkets or online. It varies in spiciness, so adjust the amount to your taste. For this dish, try to add more of the solids than the oil to the sauce for the most flavorful dish.
Sheet-Pan Baked Feta With Broccolini, Tomatoes and Lemon
By Yasmin Fahr, published in 2020
When baked, feta gains an almost creamy texture, similar to goat cheese but with feta’s characteristic tang. In this easy vegetarian sheet-pan dinner, Broccolini (or broccoli), grape tomatoes and lemon slices roast alongside the feta until the Broccolini crisp, the tomatoes burst and the lemon rinds soften. (Remember, Broccolini has a tender, delicious stalk so only the bottom half-inch needs to be trimmed.) Serve this dish over a pile of orzo for a complete meal. If you like, cut the Broccolini, feta and lemon into bite-size pieces and toss with the orzo.
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 25 minutes
Ingredients:
1 bunch Broccolini, ends trimmed, thick stalks split lengthwise, or broccoli, stalks trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces
1 pint grape tomatoes, halved (about 2 cups)
1 small red onion, peeled, quartered and cut into 2-inch wedges
1 lemon, 1/2 cut into thin rounds and the remaining 1/2 left intact, for serving
3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
Kosher salt and black pepper
2 (6- to 8-ounce) blocks feta, cut into 1-inch slices
Cooked orzo or farro, for serving
1/2 cup fresh basil or cilantro leaves and fine stems, roughly chopped (optional)
Preparation:
1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees with a rack set in the lower third. On a sheet pan, combine the Broccolini, tomatoes, onion and lemon slices with the olive oil and toss. Add cumin and red-pepper flakes, season with salt and pepper, and toss again until evenly coated. Nestle the feta slices into the vegetables. (It’s OK if they break apart a little.)
2. Roast 15 to 20 minutes, stirring halfway through but leaving the feta in place, until the Broccolini is charred at the tips, the stems are easily pierced with a fork and the tomato skins start to blister and break down.
3. Serve over orzo or farro. Drizzle with olive oil and serve with the remaining lemon half for squeezing. Top with fresh herbs, if using.
Dumpling Tomato Salad With Chile Crisp Vinaigrette
By Hetty Lui McKinnon, published in 2023
Harness the crowd-pleasing power of dumplings in this hearty yet light main course salad. The base is simple and summery: Ripe tomatoes are lightly touched with salt, garlic and basil, providing a perfectly fragrant canvas for pan-fried pot sticker dumplings. Salting intensifies the tanginess and fruitiness of tomatoes, while also coaxing out some of the juice, which becomes a light sauce for the dumplings. (Salting also works wonders for out-of-season tomatoes, meaning you could eat this salad all year round.) Use your favorite chile crisp as it is the dominant flavor in the dressing and will greatly impact the final dish; all brands of crisp will have different levels of saltiness and spice, so season accordingly.
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 20 minutes
Ingredients:
For the salad:
2 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes (any variety), cut into roughly 1- to 2-inch pieces (at room temperature)
1 garlic clove, grated
1/2 cup basil leaves, torn
Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal brand) and black pepper
1 pound frozen pot sticker dumplings (not thawed)
Neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable
1 to 2 tablespoons store-bought crispy fried shallots (optional)
For the chile crisp vinaigrette:
3 tablespoons chile crisp (or chile oil)
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce, or more to taste
Preparation:
1. Place the tomatoes on a large serving plate or in a bowl. Add the garlic, half the basil leaves, 1 teaspoon of salt and a big pinch of black pepper. Toss to combine and set aside.
2. To make the vinaigrette, combine the chile crisp, rice vinegar and soy sauce and whisk to combine. Taste and if it needs more saltiness, add 1/2 teaspoon more soy sauce.
3. Heat a large (12-inch) nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium high for 1 to 2 minutes until very hot. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil and, working in batches, add the dumplings, flat-side down, and cook until the bottoms of the dumplings are lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Immediately add about 1/4 cup of water to the pan, just enough to cover the base of the dumplings, then cover and cook until the water has evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes. (If your dumplings contain meat, cook for an extra 1 to 2 minutes, or according to packet instructions). Transfer the cooked dumplings to a plate and continue cooking the remaining dumplings. (If you prefer to steam the dumplings, see tip.)
4. To serve, place the warm dumplings over the tomato salad and drizzle with the chile crisp vinaigrette. Toss very gently. Top with the crispy fried shallots (if using) and the remaining basil leaves. Serve either while the dumplings are still warm or at room temperature.
TIP: To steam, arrange the dumplings in a steaming basket lined with baking paper or cabbage leaves, place over a pan of boiling water and steam for 10 to 15 minutes.
Coconut-Miso Salmon Curry
By Kay Chun, published in 2019
This light, delicate weeknight curry comes together in less than 30 minutes and is defined by its deep miso flavor. Miso is typically whisked into soups toward the end of the recipe, but sweating it directly in the pot with ginger, garlic and a little oil early on helps the paste caramelize, intensifying its earthy sweetness. Adding coconut milk creates a rich broth that works with a wide range of seafood. Salmon is used here, but flaky white fish, shrimp or scallops would all benefit from this quick poaching method. A squeeze of lime and a flurry of fresh herbs keep this curry bright and citrusy. For a hit of heat, garnish with sliced fresh jalapeño or serrano chile peppers.
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 25 minutes
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons safflower or canola oil
1 medium red onion, halved and sliced 1/2-inch thick (about 2 cups)
1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, minced (about 2 tablespoons)
3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
Kosher salt and black pepper
1/4 cup white miso
1/2 cup unsweetened, full-fat canned coconut milk
1 (1 1/2-pound) salmon fillet, cut into 2-inch pieces
5 ounces baby spinach (about 5 packed cups)
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, plus lime wedges for serving
Steamed rice, such as jasmine or basmati, for serving
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
Preparation:
1. In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium. Add onion, ginger and garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add miso and cook, stirring frequently, until miso is lightly caramelized, about 2 minutes.
2. Add coconut milk and 3 cups water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until liquid is slightly reduced, about 5 minutes.
3. Stir in salmon, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer gently until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Turn off heat and stir in spinach and lime juice.
4. Divide rice among bowls. Top with salmon curry, basil and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing on top.
Crisp Gnocchi With Brussels Sprouts and Brown Butter
By Ali Slagle, published in 2019
For a fantastic meal that can be ready in 20 minutes, toss together seared gnocchi and sauteed Brussels sprouts with lemon zest, red-pepper flakes and brown butter. The key to this recipe is how you cook the store-bought gnocchi: No need to boil. Just sear them until they are crisp and golden on the outside, and their insides will stay chewy. The resulting texture is reminiscent of fried dough. Shelf-stable and refrigerated gnocchi will both work here, but the shelf-stable ones do crisp up a bit better.
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 20 minutes
Ingredients:
1 pound Brussels sprouts (or cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower or even cabbage)
1 lemon
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
1 (18-ounce) package shelf-stable or refrigerated potato gnocchi
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced into 6 pieces
1/2 teaspoon honey
Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving
Preparation:
1. Trim and halve the Brussels sprouts. Using a vegetable peeler, peel thick strips of lemon zest, then coarsely chop. (You should have about 2 teaspoons chopped zest.)
2. In a large (preferably 12-inch) skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high. Add the Brussels sprouts, season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, then arrange the Brussels sprouts in an even layer, cut side down. Scatter the lemon zest over the top and cook, undisturbed, until the Brussels sprouts are well browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the red-pepper flakes, stir and cook until the Brussels sprouts are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.
3. In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high. Break up any gnocchi that are stuck together, add them to the pan and cook, covered and undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the butter and honey, season with salt and a generous amount of black pepper, and cook, stirring, until the butter is golden, nutty smelling and foaming, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the Brussels sprouts until warmed through. Serve with grated Parmesan.

Caramelized Shallot Pasta
By Alison Roman, published in 2020
This pasta is all about the shallots, cooked down in a bath of olive oil to a jammy, caramelized paste. Tomato paste is there for tanginess, and anchovies for saltiness, but they serve more as background flavors to the sweetness of the shallot. This recipe makes enough caramelized shallot mixture for a double batch of pasta, or simply keep it refrigerated to spoon over fried eggs, or to serve underneath crispy chicken thighs or over roasted root vegetables like carrots or sweet potatoes.
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 40 minutes
Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
6 large shallots, very thinly sliced
5 garlic cloves, 4 thinly sliced, 1 finely chopped
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste
1 (2-ounce) can anchovy fillets (about 12), drained
1 (4.5-ounce) tube or (6-ounce) can of tomato paste (about 1/2 to 3/4 cup)
10 ounces pasta
1 cup parsley, leaves and tender stems, finely chopped
Flaky sea salt
Preparation:
1. Heat olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium high. Add shallots and thinly sliced garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallots have become totally softened and caramelized with golden-brown fried edges, 15 to 20 minutes.
2. Add red-pepper flakes and anchovies. (No need to chop the anchovies; they will dissolve on their own.) Stir to melt the anchovies into the shallots, about 2 minutes.
3. Add tomato paste and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly to prevent any scorching, until the tomato paste has started to cook in the oil a bit, caramelizing at the edges and going from bright red to a deeper brick red color, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer about half the mixture to a resealable container, leaving the rest behind. (These are your leftovers to be used elsewhere: in another batch of pasta or smeared onto roasted vegetables, spooned over fried eggs or spread underneath crispy chicken thighs.)
4. To serve, cook pasta according to package instructions in a large pot of salted boiling water until very al dente (perhaps more al dente than usual). Transfer to Dutch oven with remaining shallot mixture (or a skillet if you are using the leftover portion) and 1 cup pasta water. Cook over medium-high heat, swirling the skillet to coat each piece of pasta, using a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up any bits on the bottom, until pasta is thick and sauce has reduced and is sticky, but not saucy, 3 to 5 minutes.
5. In a small bowl, combine parsley and finely chopped garlic clove, and season with flaky salt and pepper. Divide pasta among bowls, or transfer to one large serving bowl, and top with parsley mixture and a bit more red-pepper flakes, if you like.
Pork Chops in Lemon-Caper Sauce
By Toni Tipton-Martin, adapted by Sam Sifton, published in 2019
Here’s my favorite recipe in Toni Tipton-Martin’s excellent and invaluable “Jubilee: Recipes From Two Centuries of African American Cooking” (2019). It’s a remix of one that chef Nathaniel Burton collected into his 1978 opus, “Creole Feast: Fifteen Master Chefs of New Orleans Reveal Their Secrets,” and one that Tipton-Martin glossed-up with lemon zest, juice and extra butter, a technique she learned from the restaurateur B. Smith’s 2009 collection of recipes, “B. Smith Cooks Southern-Style.” It’s a dish of smothered pork chops, essentially, made into something glorious and elegant. “The food history of Blacks in America has been a story of the food of survival,” she said. “We need to start celebrating the food they made at work."
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 35 minutes
Preparation:
4 bone-in pork chops (about 8 ounces each)
Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 very small shallot, minced (about 1 tablespoon)
2 garlic cloves, minced (about 1 teaspoon)
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1 cup dry white wine
1 1/2 cups chicken stock, homemade or low-sodium, if store-bought
2 tablespoons drained capers
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, plus more for garnish
1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest, plus 2 tablespoons juice
Hot sauce (optional)
Ingredients:
1. Dry the chops with paper towels, and season aggressively with salt, pepper and the thyme. Swirl the olive oil into a large skillet, and heat over medium until the oil begins to shimmer. Add chops, and cook until well browned on each side and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chops to a plate, and cover to keep warm.
2. Drain the fat from the skillet, then melt 2 tablespoons of butter in it over medium heat until sizzling. Add the shallot and garlic, and saute until the aromatics soften, reducing the heat if necessary, about 1 minute. Sprinkle in the flour, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Whisk in the wine and chicken stock, raise heat to high and bring the liquid to a boil, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook, uncovered, until the liquid is reduced by half, 7 to 10 minutes.
3. Stir in the capers, parsley, lemon zest and juice and hot sauce to taste (if you’re using it), and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter until it’s melted and the sauce looks smooth. Nestle the pork chops into the sauce, and allow them to warm up for a couple of minutes, then serve, pouring sauce over each pork chop to taste. Garnish with more fresh parsley.
Southern Macaroni and Cheese
By Millie Peartree, adapted by Kiera Wright-Ruiz, published in 2019
There is macaroni and cheese, and then there is special occasion macaroni and cheese like this one. Unlike most recipes, which start with a roux, this one begins with a milk-and-egg base, which gives the dish an incredibly rich, silky taste. It’s adapted from Millie Peartree, owner of Millie Peartree Fish Fry & Soul Food restaurant in the Bronx, New York, who has been making this dish since she was a little girl. The recipe was passed down in her family for generations, but because of the generous amount of cheese used, the dish was only made for events like Christmas and Thanksgiving. Extra-sharp cheddar adds tartness and a layer of colby jack creates a gooey, molten center. If you can’t find a colby jack blend, shredded mozzarella or a Mexican-style blend will work in its place.
Yield: 8 to 10 servings
Total time: 45 minutes, plus cooling
Ingredients:
Kosher salt and black pepper
1 pound elbow macaroni
2 cups whole milk
2 large eggs
4 cups shredded extra-sharp cheddar (about 16 ounces)
1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick), melted
2 cups shredded colby jack (about 8 ounces)
Preparation:
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook according to package directions until a little under al dente, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a colander and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, whisk milk and eggs. Add cooked macaroni, 2 cups extra-sharp cheddar, melted butter, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and stir until well combined.
3. Add half the macaroni mixture to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish in an even layer. Sprinkle 1 1/2 cups Colby Jack evenly on top. Spread the remaining macaroni mixture on top in an even layer. Cover with aluminum foil, transfer to the middle rack of the oven and bake for 30 minutes.
4. Remove from oven. Carefully remove and discard the aluminum foil. Top the macaroni mixture with the remaining 2 cups cheddar and 1/2 cup colby jack. Broil on top rack until cheese is browned in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. (The broiled cheese can go from golden to burnt fairly quickly, so keep a close eye on it.)
5. Remove from oven and let cool until the macaroni and cheese is fully set, 10 to 15 minutes. (The mixture may first appear jiggly, but it will firm up as it cools.) Serve warm.
Oven-Roasted Chicken Shawarma
By Sam Sifton, published in 2015
Here is a recipe for an oven-roasted version of the flavorful street-side classic usually cooked on a rotisserie. It is perfect for an evening with family and friends. Serve with pita and tahini, chopped cucumbers and tomatoes, some olives, chopped parsley, some feta, fried eggplant, hummus swirled with harissa, rice or rice pilaf. You can make the white sauce that traditionally accompanies it by cutting plain yogurt with mayonnaise and lemon juice, and flecking it with garlic. For a red to offset it, simmer ketchup with crushed red pepper and a hit of red-wine vinegar until it goes syrupy and thick, or just use your favorite hot sauce instead.
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
Total time: 45 minutes, plus marinating
Ingredients:
2 lemons, juiced
1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil
6 cloves garlic, peeled, smashed and minced
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons paprika
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
A pinch ground cinnamon
Crushed red pepper, to taste
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1 large red onion, peeled and quartered
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
Preparation:
1. Prepare a marinade for the chicken. Combine the lemon juice, 1/2 cup olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, turmeric, cinnamon and crushed red pepper in a large bowl, then whisk to combine. Add the chicken and toss well to coat. Cover and store in refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.
2. When ready to cook, heat oven to 425 degrees. Use the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to grease a rimmed sheet pan. Add the quartered onion to the chicken and marinade, and toss once to combine. Remove the chicken and onion from the marinade, and place on the pan, spreading everything evenly across it.
3. Put the chicken in the oven and roast until it is browned, crisp at the edges and cooked through, about 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven, allow to rest 2 minutes, then slice into bits. (To make the chicken even more crisp, set a large pan over high heat, add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan, then the sliced chicken, and saute until everything curls tight in the heat.)
4. Scatter the parsley over the top and serve with tomatoes, cucumbers, pita, white sauce, hot sauce, olives, fried eggplant, feta, rice — really anything you desire.
Birria de Res (Beef Birria)
By Josef Centeno, adapted by Tejal Rao, published in 2021
Birria took off in the United States as a soupy style made with beef and as birria tacos, popularized by birria vendors in Tijuana. Chef Josef Centeno, who grew up eating beef and goat birria in Texas, makes a delicious, thickly sauced version based on his grandma Alice’s recipe, mixing up the proteins by using oxtail, lamb on the bone and even tofu (you can, too). Preparing the adobo takes time, as does browning the meat, but it’s worth it for the deep flavors in the final dish. The best way to serve birria is immediately and simply, in a bowl, with some warm corn tortillas, which can be used to wrap the meat for tacos. But make sure to put any leftovers to work: Extra meat, pulled from the bones, can be shredded for crisp quesabirria tacos, fried in the birria fat for cheesy, lacy edges. And the leftover broth, or consome, is ideal for a comforting bowl of birria ramen, with an egg and some fresh herbs on top.
Yield: 8 to 10 servings
Total time: 2 3/4 hours
Ingredients:
2 poblano chiles
5 guajillo chiles, seeded, stemmed and halved lengthwise
5 pounds bone-in beef shoulder, cut into large pieces, or goat or lamb stew cuts on the bone
1 tablespoon fine sea salt
1/4 cup neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed
1 medium white onion, finely chopped
1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
6 garlic cloves, peeled
2 tablespoons finely grated fresh ginger
2 teaspoons dried Mexican oregano
2 teaspoons toasted white sesame seeds
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
4 cloves
Fresh black pepper
1 cinnamon stick
2 fresh or dried bay leaves
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 limes, quartered
Corn tortillas, warmed
Preparation:
1. Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
2. Prepare the chiles: Use tongs to place the poblano chiles directly over the open flame of a gas burner set to high. Cook the poblanos until totally charred all over, turning as needed, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a small bowl and cover with plastic wrap so the poblanos can steam. After 10 minutes, use your fingers to pull the blackened skins away from the poblanos, then remove the stems and seeds. Roughly chop the poblanos and set aside.
3. While the poblano chiles steam, place a large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches to cook the guajillo chiles evenly in one layer, flatten the chile halves on the hot skillet and toast them for about 15 seconds, turning once. Put the chiles in a bowl and add 2 cups hot water to help soften them. Set aside.
4. Prepare the meat: Season the meat all over with the salt. Heat the oil in a large, ovenproof pot over medium-high. Working in batches, sear the meat on all sides until well browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side, transferring the browned meat to a large bowl as you work.
5. After you’ve seared all the meat, add the onion to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes. Return all the meat to the pot.
6. Meanwhile, add the tomatoes, vinegar, garlic, ginger, oregano, sesame seeds, cumin, cloves and a few grinds of black pepper to a blender, along with the chopped poblanos, toasted guajillos and the chile soaking liquid. Puree until smooth, scraping down the edges of the blender as needed.
7. Pour the blended mixture into the pot with the meat. Add the cinnamon stick and bay leaves, along with about 4 to 6 cups of water, enough to amply cover the meat.
8. Cover and cook in the oven until the meat is fork-tender, about 2 hours.
9. Divide among bowls and sprinkle with cilantro. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing on top, and a side of warm tortillas.

Gochujang Caramel Cookies
By Eric Kim, published in 2022
Gochujang, the fermented Korean chile paste, offers intrigue in this otherwise classic chewy sugar cookie. A gentle amount of ground cinnamon lends snickerdoodle vibes, and the dough is raked through with ripples of clay-red gochujang “caramel,” in which brown sugar and butter mellow the chile’s heat. Mixing this dough by hand is highly recommended for the most defined crinkles and the chewiest texture.
Yield: About 8 large cookies
Total time: 45 minutes
Ingredients:
1/2 cup (8 tablespoons)/115 grams unsalted butter, very soft
2 packed tablespoons dark brown sugar
1 heaping tablespoon gochujang
1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar
1 large egg, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon coarse kosher salt or 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cups/185 grams all-purpose flour
Preparation:
1. In a small bowl, stir together 1 tablespoon butter, the brown sugar and gochujang until smooth. Set aside for later, at room temperature.
2. In a large bowl, by hand, whisk together the remaining 7 tablespoons butter, the granulated sugar, egg, salt, cinnamon and vanilla until smooth, about 1 minute. Switch to a flexible spatula and stir in the baking soda. Add the flour and gently stir to combine. Place this large bowl in the refrigerator until the dough is less sticky but still soft and pliable, 15 to 20 minutes.
3. While the dough is chilling, heat the oven to 350 degrees and line 2 large sheet pans with parchment.
4. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. In 3 to 4 separately spaced out blobs, spoon the gochujang mixture over the cookie dough. Moving in long circular strokes, swirl the gochujang mixture into the cookie dough so you have streaks of orange-red rippled throughout the beige. Be sure not to overmix at this stage, as you want wide, distinct strips of gochujang.
5. Use an ice cream scoop to plop out 1/4-cup rounds spaced at least 3 inches apart on the sheet pans. (You should get 4 to 5 cookies per pan.) Bake until lightly golden at the edges and dry and set in the center, 11 to 13 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through. Let cool completely on the sheet pan; the cookies will flatten slightly and continue cooking as they cool. The cookies will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.
Limonada (Brazilian Lemonade)
By Gabriella Lewis, published in 2023
Creamy, frosty and tart, this popular Brazilian drink is a fantastic refreshment for a hot day. In Brazil, it’s also known as limonada Suíça, which translates to Swiss lemonade, because it typically includes sweetened condensed milk, which was marketed by the Swiss company Nestlé in Brazil in the 1940s. Sweetened condensed milk is essential to Brazilian sweets, including desserts like brigadeiros. A shelf-stable dairy product that doesn’t curdle in the presence of acid, it gets blended here with limes, sugar, ice and water to make this tangy beverage creamy. Limonada Suíça always includes condensed milk, but limonada sometimes leaves it out. And even though it’s called lemonade, it often uses limes since the word limão is often used interchangeably for lemons and limes in Portuguese. Pulsing the entire lime into this drink adds an extra layer of brightness and depth from the rind. This drink takes only minutes to blend and is best served immediately.
Yield: 6 servings
Total time: 10 minutes
Ingredients:
4 limes, scrubbed and washed, plus wedges or wheels for serving
1/3 cup sugar
7 ounces sweetened condensed milk (or, for a dairy-free version, use 7 ounces sweetened condensed coconut milk)
4 cups cold water
4 cups ice, plus more for serving
Preparation:
1. Cut off and discard the tips of the limes, then cut the limes in quarters.
2. Working in batches if your blender is smaller, pulse limes, sugar, sweetened condensed milk, water and ice in a blender 5 to 8 times until the ingredients are just combined. You’re looking to extract flavor from the limes, but not to pulverize them, which can make the drink too bitter. Pieces of lime rind may still be visible.
3. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a large pitcher or bowl with a spout. Use the back of a spoon to push out as much liquid as possible; discard the solids.
4. Divide among tall, ice-filled glasses, garnish with lime wedges and serve immediately.
Tinto de Verano

A drink built and named for summer, Spain’s effervescent tinto de verano (summer red wine) matches the season’s easygoing nature. At its most traditional, the recipe sticks to just three ingredients: ice, red wine and citrus soda. (La Casera, from Spain, is most classic, but 7UP and Sprite also work.) This version includes an option for a bright lemon-lime syrup mixed with soda water to stand in for the classic’s soft drink, plus a pour of vermouth for rounder, herbal notes. But, should you prefer your tinto de verano adhere to tradition, feel free to add more red wine in place of the vermouth. While the below recipe will yield a balanced, light and fizzy tinto de verano, there’s no need to get overly caught up on perfect measurements, the drink readily adapts to personal preference — and eyeballing ounces.
Yield: 1 drink
Total time: 20 minutes, plus 1 1/2 hours for optional syrup
Ingredients:
For the lemon-lime syrup (optional):
Peel of 1 lemon
Peel of 1 lime
3/4 cup sugar
Pinch of fine sea salt
3/4 cup/6 ounces fresh lemon juice (from about 2 1/2 large lemons)
For the drink:
Ice
2 ounces dry red wine
3/4 ounce sweet vermouth (optional)
4 ounces lemon-lime soda, such as La Casera, 7UP or Sprite (or use 3/4 ounce Lemon-Lime Simple Syrup, plus 2 to 4 ounces soda water)
Lemon wheel, for garnish
Preparation:
1. If making the lemon-lime syrup, place the citrus peels in a small saucepan, and add the sugar and salt. Use a muddler or the end of a rolling pin to break down the mixture, working the sugar mixture into the peels until they start to express their oils. Add the lemon juice and stir to combine. Heat over low, stirring frequently, just until the sugar dissolves. Immediately remove the pan from the heat and set aside to steep for 1 to 2 hours. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids. (You should have about 1 cup syrup. The syrup can be stored, in an airtight container in the refrigerator, for up to 3 weeks.)
2. In an ice-filled cocktail shaker, combine the wine, vermouth and syrup, if using. Cover and shake until cold, then strain into an ice-filled highball or wineglass. Top with soda (or soda water), and mix gently to combine. Garnish with the lemon wheel and serve.
French Onion Grilled Cheese
By Ali Slagle, published in 2019
Grilled cheese is a near-perfect food on its own, but adding bacon, kimchi or, in this case, heaps of caramelized onions really makes it special. Caramelizing onions takes a good half-hour, so save this recipe for when you have a little extra time and company (this recipe serves two). If time permits, you could even prep them ahead in a slow cooker. Rather than layer the grated Gruyère and the warm caramelized onions in the sandwich, you should stir them together before assembling, which guarantees that the cheese will melt evenly throughout and that each bite will contain the perfect ratio of fragrant cheese to jammy onions. A splash of sherry, red-wine or white-wine vinegar added to the onions balances out the buttery flavors, but a side salad dressed with a tangy mustard vinaigrette would do the trick, too.
Yield: 2 servings
Total time: 45 minutes
Ingredients:
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 pound yellow or Vidalia onions, peeled, halved and thinly sliced
Kosher salt and black pepper
2 teaspoons sherry, red-wine or white-wine vinegar (optional)
4 ounces Gruyère cheese, grated
4 slices bread, cut no wider than 1/2-inch thick
Preparation:
1. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add the onions and season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook, stirring once or twice, until the onions are softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Uncover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. If the onions look dry or like they might burn, add a few tablespoons of water at a time, scraping up any browned bits that are stuck to the bottom of the skillet. If desired, once the onions are done, deglaze the skillet with vinegar and cook until the liquid has evaporated, about 1 minute. Transfer the onions to a medium bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper. Wipe out the skillet, or wash it, if necessary.
2. Add the cheese to the onions and stir to combine. Put down two slices of bread, and scoop half of the cheese-onion mixture onto each one. Top with the remaining slices of bread, and press down gently.
3. In the skillet, melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Add the sandwiches and cook until the bottoms turn golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes, reducing the heat to prevent toast from darkening too quickly, if needed. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, flip the sandwiches, press down and cook until the cheese has fully melted and the bottoms turn golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately.
Black Sesame Rice Krispies Treats
By Eric Kim, published in 2024
The combination of butter-fried black sesame seeds and toasted sesame oil creates an aromatic whammy of nutty sesame flavor in otherwise classic Rice Krispies Treats. To quickly and evenly distribute the cereal in the sticky melted marshmallows, it helps to use two utensils and stir the blend like you’re frying rice. Pressing the mixture into a 9-inch square baking pan turns out perfect squares, but the size and shape of your vessel is up to you. Another option is to spread out the mixture on a greased sheet pan into airy clusters. If you want to feel like a kid (or are one), you can put those clusters into a bowl and pour over milk to enjoy as cereal.
Yield: 16 servings
Total time: 30 minutes
Ingredients:
2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, plus more for greasing
6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter
1/4 cup/38 grams black sesame seeds (see tip)
1 (12-ounce/340-gram) bag marshmallows
3/4 teaspoon coarse kosher salt or 1 teaspoon flaky kosher salt
6 cups/160 grams Rice Krispies cereal
Preparation:
1. Grease a 9-inch square baking pan with sesame oil.
2. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until the milk solids at the bottom of the pan start to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and add the sesame seeds. Cook, stirring constantly, until the seeds smell toasty, 1 to 2 minutes.
3. Add the marshmallows and salt and stir until melted, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the 2 teaspoons sesame oil.
4. Add the cereal and quickly stir until evenly coated. Immediately press into the greased pan.
5. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before flipping out onto a cutting board and slicing into squares. The treats can be stored in an airtight container for up to 4 days at room temperature.
TIP: Black sesame seeds are sold raw or roasted. Both work here, but roasted ones will toast more quickly. The seeds taste bitter if they’re rancid, so be sure to check the expiration date and taste a few seeds before using.

THE TALKERS
Standout stories from the best comments section on the internet
Katharine Hepburn’s Brownies
By The New York Times, published in 2003
Much like its author, this recipe is a no-fuss classic. It calls for just 1/4 cup of flour, which yields an incredibly rich and gooey brownie, and it’s super easy to make. So easy, in fact, that baking a batch of these might just become part of your weekend routine.
Yield: 12 brownies
Total time: About 45 minutes
Ingredients:
1/2 cup cocoa
1/2 cup butter (1 stick)
2 eggs
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup flour
1 cup chopped or broken-up walnuts or pecans
1 teaspoon vanilla
Pinch of salt
Preparation:
1. Heat oven to 325 degrees.
2. Melt butter in saucepan with cocoa and stir until smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes, then transfer to a large bowl. Whisk in eggs, one at a time. Stir in vanilla.
3. In a separate bowl, combine sugar, flour, nuts and salt. Add to the cocoa-butter mixture. Stir until just combined.
4. Pour into a greased 8 x 8-inch-square pan. Bake 30 to 35 minutes. Do not overbake; the brownies should be gooey. Let cool, then cut into bars.
Marcella Hazan’s Bolognese Sauce
By Marcella Hazan, adapted by The New York Times, published in 2013
After the death in 2013 of Marcella Hazan, the cookbook author who changed the way Americans cook Italian food, the Times asked readers which of her recipes had become staples in their kitchens. Many people answered with one word: “Bolognese.” Hazan had a few recipes for the classic sauce, and they are all outstanding. This one appeared in her book “Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking,” and one reader called it “the gold standard.” Try it and see for yourself.
Yield: 2 heaping cups, for about 6 servings and 1 1/2 pounds pasta
Total time: At least 4 hours
Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 tablespoons butter plus 1 tablespoon for tossing the pasta
1/2 cup chopped onion
2/3 cup chopped celery
2/3 cup chopped carrot
3/4 pound ground beef chuck (or you can use 1 part pork to 2 parts beef)
Salt
Black pepper, ground fresh from the mill
1 cup whole milk
Whole nutmeg
1 cup dry white wine
1 1/2 cups canned imported Italian plum tomatoes, cut up, with their juice
1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds pasta
Freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese at the table
Preparation:
1. Put the oil, butter and chopped onion in the pot and turn the heat on to medium. Cook and stir the onion until it has become translucent, then add the chopped celery and carrot. Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring vegetables to coat them well.
2. Add ground beef, a large pinch of salt and a few grindings of pepper. Crumble the meat with a fork, stir well and cook until the beef has lost its raw, red color.
3. Add milk and let it simmer gently, stirring frequently, until it has bubbled away completely. Add a tiny grating — about 1/8 teaspoon — of nutmeg, and stir.
4. Add the wine, let it simmer until it has evaporated, then add the tomatoes and stir thoroughly to coat all ingredients well. When the tomatoes begin to bubble, turn the heat down so that the sauce cooks at the laziest of simmers, with just an intermittent bubble breaking through to the surface. Cook, uncovered, for 3 hours or more, stirring from time to time. While the sauce is cooking, you are likely to find that it begins to dry out and the fat separates from the meat. To keep it from sticking, add 1/2 cup of water whenever necessary. At the end, however, no water at all must be left and the fat must separate from the sauce. Stir to mix the fat into the sauce, taste and correct for salt.
5. Toss with cooked drained pasta, adding the tablespoon of butter, and serve with freshly grated Parmesan on the side.

Sticker Covering Your Camera? OK, Go Clubbing.: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: It's standard practice in Berlin, and camera covering is catching on in London, Ibiza and New York as clubs seek to protect an anything-goes atmosphere.
On a recent Sunday afternoon, the line outside Berghain, the Berlin techno club, stretched for hours. Hundreds of visitors, sweating in black outfits, lined the dusty path to the door, hoping to be allowed into the former power station, which is known worldwide for its tough door policy, starry D.J. lineups and hedonistic parties lasting nearly 36 hours.
The club is also notorious because, despite its reputation as one of the world's pre-eminent techno venues, its parties aren't documented online. Clubgoers are warned at the door that photos and videos are banned: Any violation will result in expulsion. To ensure compliance, door staff place stickers on the front and back of patrons' smartphones, covering their cameras.
Although this may seem excessive to visitors, such camera policies have become standard practice in Berlin clubs as a crucial tool for maintaining an anything-goes atmosphere, and clubs elsewhere are increasingly following Berlin's lead.
Respected venues, including Fabric in London and Radion in Amsterdam have all brought in similar sticker rules in recent years. Pikes Ibiza, on the Spanish island famous for its nightlife, announced last month that all visitors must now cover their cameras, so that "what happens at Pikes stays at Pikes."
Téa Abashidze, a founder of Basement, a Brooklyn techno club that has been stickering visitors' phones since 2019, said in an email that it was part of a "cultural shift" toward "genuine, distraction-free experiences." The club rigorously enforced the rule, she said, sometimes throwing several rule-breakers out per night.
Daniel Plasch, a co-director of the Berlin venue R.S.O., said that the growing international popularity of such policies reflected an appreciation for the city's clubbing ethos.
"Other cities have clubs, but Berlin has a clubbing culture," he said. "There is something unifying, ritualistic about the dance floor," he added, but the atmosphere was ruined when people use their phones to take images that "they will never look at again, anyways."
"By taking a photo," Plasch said, "you are destroying the moment even as you are documenting it."
In recent decades, Berlin's clubbing scene has become more professionalized and venues like Berghain and Tresor have become some of the city's biggest tourist draws. According to a 2019 study from the city's Club Commission, visitors who come to Berlin for the clubbing contributed around $ 1.7 billion to the city's economy.
Paradoxically, the city's economic success has threatened the existence of many clubs, with some struggling to adapt to gentrification and conflicts with new, affluent neighbors. This month, Watergate, an influential club located on the Spree River, announced that it would be closing at the end of the year because of rising rent and energy prices.
Aside the city's exacting door policies, the no-photo rule remains one of the few ways for the venues to retain a countercultural atmosphere despite the influx of tourists. Stathis Tsitinis, a Berlin D.J. who co-founded a gay party called Power Dance Club, said that he had noticed an explosion of interest in techno among young people weaned on the internet during the pandemic.
Many of these newcomers, he added, had little sense of the unspoken laws of Berlin clubs, including the ban on photography, making it crucial to cover their cameras. "It used to be that you were part of the community, and you knew the rules, but now you can't control the quality of the clubbers," Tsitinis said. "Do you really want to be in someone's picture in your jockstrap? That's not exactly everyone's cup of tea."
Matthias Pasdzierny, a professor of musicology partly focusing on techno at Berlin's University of the Arts, said that photo bans have also allowed clubs to assert "power and control" over their image. "The less photos there are of something, the more exciting it becomes," he said. "It's very smart marketing."
People's obsession with finding out what happens inside the clubs "can be absurd," he said, noting a 2009 illustrated feature in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, a German newspaper, that showed the interior of Berghain, drawn entirely from memory. "It almost makes it seem like a fairy tale," he said.
But on a recent Sunday night, people lining up to enter R.S.O., where the party had already been going for 20 hours, were uniformly in support of the club's stickering policy.
Zandra Hedlund, 41, a programmer who had moved to Berlin from Sweden, said that she valued the ways it allowed people to enjoy sex-positive spaces without worrying about their behavior being posted online. "When people are taking photos near me, I think about how I look, or have to try to avoid being in the photos," she said, adding that the photo ban made her feel "more relaxed."
Another clubgoer, Maud Ferrier, 25, who works as a bartender at the Kitkat Club, a fetish nightclub in the city, said that "many of the tourists really fight against the rule, because they feel like it is removing their freedom." But in the end, she said, by giving up something, they always end up feeling more free.

High Cost Of Growth For OpenAI: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: As the company looks for more outside investors, documents reviewed by The New York Times show consumer fascination with ChatGPT and a serious need for more cash.
OpenAI, the San Francisco start-up behind ChatGPT, has been telling investors that it is making billions from its chatbot and that it expects to make a lot more in the coming years. But it has not been quite so clear about how much it is losing.
OpenAI's monthly revenue hit $ 300 million in August, up 1,700 percent since the beginning of 2023, and the company expects about $ 3.7 billion in annual sales this year, according to financial documents reviewed by The New York Times. OpenAI estimates that its revenue will balloon to $ 11.6 billion next year.
But it expects to lose roughly $ 5 billion this year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses like employee salaries and office rent, according to an analysis by a financial professional who has also reviewed the documents. Those numbers do not include paying out equity-based compensation to employees, among several large expenses not fully explained in the documents.
OpenAI has been circulating the documents with potential investors for an investment round that could bring in $ 7 billion and value the company at $ 150 billion, among the highest ever for a private tech company. The round, which could close as early as next week, comes at a crucial time for OpenAI, which is experiencing rapid growth but has lost a number of important executives and researchers in the past few months.
The documents offer the first detailed look into OpenAI's financial performance and how it is presenting itself to investors, but they do not neatly explain how much money it is losing. The fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products.
OpenAI declined to comment on the documents.
OpenAI's revenue in August more than tripled from a year ago, according to the documents, and about 350 million people -- up from around 100 million in March -- used its services each month as of June.
Most of that has come from the continuing popularity of ChatGPT, which was released in November 2022. The documents show a spike in growth after ChatGPT began allowing people to use the service without creating an account or logging in. The company expects ChatGPT to bring in $ 2.7 billion in revenue this year, up from $ 700 million in 2023, with $ 1 billion coming from other businesses using its technology.
Roughly 10 million ChatGPT users pay the company a $ 20 monthly fee, according to the documents. OpenAI expects to raise that price by $ 2 by the end of the year, and will aggressively raise it to $ 44 over the next five years, the documents said. More than one million third-party developers use OpenAI's technology to power their own services.
OpenAI predicts its revenue will hit $ 100 billion in 2029, which would roughly match the current annual sales of Nestlé or Target.
Like other high-profile tech start-ups of the last few decades, OpenAI is struggling to get its costs under control.
Its biggest cost is the computing power it gets through a partnership with Microsoft, which is also OpenAI's primary investor. Microsoft has pumped more than $ 13 billion into the San Francisco company. But OpenAI spends much of that money on Microsoft's cloud computing systems, which host OpenAI's products.
In addition to Thrive Capital, the lead investor in the new round, OpenAI is in talks with Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Tiger Global and MGX, a technology investment firm controlled by the United Arab Emirates, according to three people familiar with the discussions.
OpenAI is offering unusual deal structures to investors. Thrive Capital has invested $ 750 million into OpenAI's latest round of funding, according to a person familiar with the deal. In addition to putting in its own money, the firm plans to use a financial instrument called a special purpose vehicle to gather an additional $ 450 million from other investors, the person said.
As the deal's lead investor, Thrive also has an unusual perk: the option to invest up to $ 1 billion more into OpenAI at the same $ 150 billion valuation through 2025, according to the documents. That could be lucrative to Thrive given how quickly OpenAI's valuation has escalated to $ 150 billion, up from just $ 30 billion a year ago.
None of OpenAI's other investors have been granted the same terms, and some of them were frustrated by the special preference, according to two people familiar with those discussions.
(The Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)
OpenAI's deal discussions could be affected by three high-profile departures from the company this week. On Wednesday evening, its chief technology officer, Mira Murati, resigned, followed quickly by Bob McGrew, the chief research officer, and Barret Zoph, a vice president of research.
The funding discussions also come as OpenAI works to restructure itself into a for-profit company. Sam Altman, now the company's chief executive, the tech kingpin Elon Musk and several other technologists founded the A.I. research lab in late 2015 as a nonprofit, whose board still maintains control over the company's operations.
But in 2018, after Mr. Musk and his funding left, Mr. Altman transformed the operation into what is called a capped-profit company so that he could raise the billions of dollars needed to build artificial intelligence. This organization provided a return for investors, but these profits were capped. And it has been governed by a nonprofit board of directors that does not answer to investors.
As part of the investment round, OpenAI has two years to convert to a for-profit business, or its funding will convert into debt, according to the deal documents.

Full text: Our 50 favorite places in America right now.
We have finished our annual search for America's best restaurants.
Over the last 12 months, reporters and editors traveled to nearly every state scouting restaurants for our annual list. This year, it was about spaces as much as places. We ate hyperlocal dishes served out of a trailer in a rural Virginia field, experienced one of America's most refined seasonal tasting menus in one of San Francisco's most refined rooms, dined on Creole fare in a strip mall down the road from NASA in Texas and joined a party behind a tattered ranch house in Johns Island, S.C.
Of our choices, 32 are new, opened since the 2023 list was assembled. But we also made space for longstanding restaurants still in top form, including one that opened in 1976. As always, there were no-brainers and tough choices -- the United States has a vast, diverse spread of great restaurants these days -- but these are our 50 favorites for 2024. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Mr. Baan's Bar and Mookata
Phoenix Thai Opened November 2023 mrbaans.com
Three things to know: You will need an appetite. You will be better off with a big group. And you will want cocktails. One of only three restaurants in the United States that serves the mookata style of Thai cooking -- the other two are in Queens and San Francisco -- Mr. Baan's is the next-door sibling to Phoenix's acclaimed Lom Wong. The mookata setup is a dome-shaped charcoal-fired grill on which you cook your own soy-marinated pork, coriander beef or black-pepper chicken. Surrounding the dome is a moat filled with already rich pork broth that is further fortified by the meat drippings. To this, you add noodles, minced pork, vegetables, mushrooms and various sauces to create a soup of your own specifications, hot-pot style. It's a party, and, never fear, refills on all elements are included. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Quince
San Francisco Seasonal Tasting Menu Opened 2003, Reopened 2023 quincerestaurant.com
After more than 20 years, dinner at Michael and Lindsay Tusk's Quince is still a master class in the NorCal culinary vernacular. The produce, much of it grown 30 miles up the coast in Bolinas, is superb. And naturally, the menu changes with the seasons. But Mr. Tusk's dishes -- a roasted spiny lobster with black trumpet mushrooms and fava greens, for instance, or sunchoke velouté with a local oyster, chanterelles and sorrel -- are a deft balance of cheffing and sourcing. The recently redesigned space feels at once contemporary and timeless. The elegantly spare décor and widely spaced tables are de rigueur for a three-Michelin-starred restaurant, but the dining room is warmed by Ms. Tusk's presiding presence. Dinner is an expensive occasion at $ 390 a person (though you can have a four-course lunch for $ 175). But when you imagine a perfect California fine-dining restaurant, you're imagining Quince. You just may not know it until you eat there. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Four Kings
San Francisco Cantonese American Opened March 2024 itsfourkings.com
Four Kings is breathing much-needed fire into San Francisco's dining scene. The chefs Franky Ho and Mike Long, from the acclaimed Mister Jiu's, and their partners Millie Boonkokua and Lucy Li have conjured a restaurant where the surgical precision of their fine-dining past flows as an undercurrent. But the spot-on vibes and energetic dishes are singular here. Nuggets of XO escargot are tucked into shells blanketed with a buttery sheen, served with pillowy milk bread. Sichuan cabbage presents as deceivingly simple on the menu, but surprises as one of the best dishes thanks to a generous dusting of scallion powder. And that's what Four Kings will do: grab you in a way that's bold, exhilarating and needed. ELEANORE PARK
Fikscue
Alameda, Calif. Texas Barbecue, Indonesian Opened November 2023 fikscue.com
When the married couple Reka and Fik Saleh opened their brick storefront, Fikscue, last November, their clientele -- devoted since the pandemic-pop-up days -- followed swiftly across the Bay, where halal Texas-style barbecue and Indonesian cuisine coalesce. Ms. Saleh deftly weaves together the electric brightness and texture of Indonesia's underrepresented cuisine with the stalwart comfort of barbecue. The meltingly tender, jiggly brisket and smoked dino ribs alone are worth the nearly two-hour wait to eat here. But Indonesian dishes -- like the Sumatran beef noodle soup, batagor, where beef ribs slowly simmer in a pool of lemongrass, makrut lime leaves and galangal, and the balado plate of smoked fried chicken nested under a sauce punched up with fermented heat -- round out a menu unlike anything else in the country. ELEANORE PARK
Camélia
Los Angeles Japanese, French Opened July 2024 cameliadtla.com
A delicately crunchy slice of ham katsu, enrobed in Mornay sauce, rests on a slice of sweet, buttery house-made shokupan, almost entirely hidden by a softly fried egg. Even the basic croque-madame here is a thoughtfully composed thrill. Charles Namba and Courtney Kaplan, known for their sake-focused Japanese restaurants, have opened a chic, freewheeling bistro that almost feels as if it were imported from the 11th Arrondissement, but has a distinctly Los Angeles flavor. It's an ideal spot to meet for an aperitif and an aioli garni, but even better to make a long and winding dinner out of its hits. Take the tomatoes and burrata (yawn!) scattered here with fried shiso leaves and a habit-forming ponzu jelly, so soft and delicate that it becomes the dressing. This is the magic of a good bistro: a place where you can come across the familiar, and even predictable, and fall in love with it again. TEJAL RAO
Azizam
Los Angeles Iranian Opened March 2024 azizamla.com
With all due respect to grilled meat on skewers, Cody Ma and Misha Sesar have been using the hashtag #notjustkebabs since they started Azizam as a pop-up in 2021, determined to expand the idea of Iranian food in Los Angeles. Their casual Silver Lake cafe is devoted to the kind of deeply delicious, often labor-intensive cooking that doesn't like to show off about how much prep (a lot) goes into it. The kitchen bakes nigella seed-freckled barbari each day for its sandwiches, which might be filled with sliced beef tongue or herb-packed kuku sabzi. Stay for a bigger meal, and the rewards are bigger, too: The kofteh Tabrizi is a single, family-size, fruit-studded meatball in tangy broth. The ash-e-jo -- an unassuming jewel based on Mr. Ma's mother's recipe -- is a luxuriously slippery rendition of the stew, stacked with barley, lentils, kidney beans and chickpeas, and crowned with caramelized onions and fried mint. It tastes like being home, no matter where you're from. TEJAL RAO
Yuan Wonton
Denver Chinese Opened September 2023 instagram.com/yuanwonton
After four years as a beloved food truck, the chef Penelope Wong's dumpling operation found a brick-and-mortar home last year. Part of the joy here is the variety of choices, several of which rotate. There are Hong Kong-style "YW OG" wontons in Sichuan chile oil, tom kha chicken wontons, Chinese chive pockets and steamed chashu pork bao. All are expertly constructed with handmade doughs. Much of the rest of the menu changes as well, but on one visit, the hero was the jok, a Chinese congee with chicken and a warming, nervy duet of ginger and pickled bird's-eye chile that made the dish hum. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Sap Sua
Denver Modern Vietnamese Opened 2023 sapsua.com
Since the husband-and-wife team Anna and Ni Nguyen opened what they call their "nontraditional Vietnamese restaurant," they have been stacking accolades, including best new restaurant mentions from national media and a James Beard semifinalist nod for the same. All well deserved. Their trứng và trứng alone would warrant the praise. Described simply as "soft scrambled egg, brown butter, fish sauce, trout roe, rice," the dish coaxes the humble egg into an improbably rich, custardy realm. And the rest of the menu does not disappoint. Skeins of mint, chiles and ginger run through dishes that play on traditional Vietnamese preparations, but still taste wholly original. Booking at prime dinner hour can still be tricky, though not as Sisyphean as it once was. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Meander Eatery
Pagosa Springs, Colo. New American, Farm-to-Table Opened 2022 meandereatery.com
Tucked into the southern reaches of the San Juan Mountains, Meander is a gem of a country restaurant. The chef Justin Jacobs spent time in the kitchen at Frasca, in Boulder, among the region's most renowned restaurants, but has left the white-tablecloth life behind. The menu here is unapologetically eclectic, with quality ingredients, especially produce, and sure-handed cooking keeps it coherent. A Dutch baby topped with a creamy lump crab meat mixture made a novel twist on breakfast for dinner, while a "patio smoked" bratwurst, made in house, was a deftly spiced version of that quintessential cased meat. Particularly on a warm evening, a table on the back deck is the perfect place to have dinner and watch the San Juan River, well, meander by. BRIAN GALLAGHER
The Shipwright's Daughter
Mystic, Conn. Seafood, American Opened 2020 shipwrightsdaughter.com
Mystic is your classic New England tourist town, well provisioned with fudge, ice cream and, famously, pizza. But it's also becoming a dining destination, with two innovative bar-restaurants from the chef Renee Touponce and this refined but deceptively casual-looking entry from David Standridge, who won this year's James Beard award for Best Chef: Northeast. His website's paean to sustainability and local seafood (including undervalued species like sea robin, green crab and limpets) is more than backed up by dishes like velvety roasted oysters and a delicate batter-fried fillet of whiting. But the highlights here range far beyond the sea: inventive pastas built around the produce of the moment, an exemplary roast chicken and the crispy pig's head, a voluptuous take on tête de veau that should become a tourist attraction in itself. PATRICK FARRELL
Walrus Rodeo
Miami Modern Italian Opened 2022 walrusrodeo.com
A slice of lasagna at Walrus Rodeo is thin, with a dark, charred surface. From a distance it looks like a healthy serving of parmigiana. Forkfuls reveal wilted mustard greens, tangy stracchino, lamb ragù hinting of moussaka. The food here toys with your expectations in this way, with dishes that look familiar, only to reveal flavors you didn't predict. Servers mash carrot tartare, bound by espuma and salsa verde, as soon as it lands on the table; charred long beans hold dollops of lemon curd. The staff will make you feel lucky to be part of the scene unfolding nightly in this unassuming Little Haiti strip mall. And while the restaurant lives up to its "not just a pizzeria" tagline, you should order at least one pie. BRETT ANDERSON
La Camaronera
Miami Cuban Seafood Opened 1976 lacamaronera.com
La Camaronera's pan con minuta is a sandwich containing a whole gutted fried snapper, minus the head but including the tail. It's more fish than the lightly toasted Cuban roll can contain. The sandwich, the most popular order at this 50-plus-year-old Little Havana seafood joint, is both hard to miss and hard to resist. The qualities that make it so delicious -- notably the fried-to-order crispness of the fresh fish -- are found across the menu, which contains some of the South's best fried seafood and more. That great-looking hogfish for sale at the retail counter? Order a skin-on fillet of it grilled, with a side of black-eyed-pea fritters. BRETT ANDERSON
Bread & Butterfly
Atlanta French, Haitian Opened August 2023 bread-and-butterfly.com
After a series of pop-ups, Demetrius Brown quietly took over a much-loved French cafe and transformed dinner into a showcase for French cuisine as interpreted by Caribbean cooks, particularly from Haiti. Cilantro, thyme and epis, the herbaceous spice blend, perfume a delicate interpretation of the classic beef patty. In the same way, Mr. Brown uses English peas and local mushrooms to enhance djon-djon, a dish named after a type of Haitian mushroom. He marinates halibut for escovitch, and marries single-origin Haitian chocolate with coconut ice cream. The kitchen-driven cocktail list gets a special nod, especially nonalcoholic surprises made with snap pea juice and matcha. If more traditional French food is what you had in mind, there are always the lunch and breakfast menus. KIM SEVERSON
Nàdair
Atlanta Scottish, Southern Opened May 2024 nadairatl.com
Nàdair is the Scottish-Southern mash-up no one knew American dining needed. It's the latest and most personal restaurant from Kevin Gillespie, the red-bearded chef who became a star in the early seasons of "Top Chef." With a carpet woven in the colors of his family's tartan and a pocketful of his Scottish granny's recipes, you'd think the place would be a stodgy tribute to oats and haggis. It's anything but. Yes, there is haggis, but it's a clever vegetarian version in crisp pastry with peated whiskey cream and mushroom velouté. A tender cornmeal crust gives a Scottish cheese and onion pie a Georgia kiss. Lacquered pork shoulder that takes a couple of weeks to cure and smoke arrives with a collard-green dumpling. A small plate with fancy twists on sweet Scottish classics like tablet candy and snowball cookies sends you off into the Atlanta night. KIM SEVERSON
Asador Bastian
Chicago Basque Opened 2023 asadorbastian.com
It is no small thing to call this chophouse's steak the best in Chicago. But it's hard to argue with the evidence, be it a bone-in rib-eye of Galician beef, rimmed with yellow fat, or a cut of dry-aged Holstein that all but instructs you to order an old Rioja Gran Reserva (there are some good ones). Now consider that those steaks have to fight for supremacy with seafood from the plancha and even a simple tortilla, albeit crowned with a ribbon of nutty jamón. You know how New York carnivores can't get enough of neo-brasseries like Frenchette and Minetta Tavern? Asador Bastian is kind of like that, only Basque, and in the city that was once the meatpacking capital of the world. BRETT ANDERSON
North of Bourbon
Louisville, Ky. Modern Cajun-Creole Opened 2021 northofbourbon.com
Lawrence Weeks is among a growing cadre of chefs breathing fresh life into New Orleans cuisine with restaurants outside Louisiana. He does so with cunning refinements to common dishes. Things like fried catfish set under a drift of chopped Haitian pikliz, and crab dressing sparked by cilantro and lime. The gumbo is as dark and enticing as what you'll find in Cajun Country, only thick with smoked brisket and wilted greens. North of Bourbon established Mr. Weeks as one of the region's most exciting new chefs. A similar dynamism is on display at Enso, which opened last year, where the chef looks beyond Louisiana with food that blends Southern and Japanese cuisine. BRETT ANDERSON
Acamaya
New Orleans Mexican Opened July 2024 acamayanola.com
The food at Acamaya falls into roughly two categories. There are the dishes that send your eyebrows upward at first sight, like the painterly aguachile or the arroz negro topped with mussels that look like a display of emeralds. And there are the dishes that don't appear far removed from what you'd find on a grandmother's stove in Mexico City (at least until you take your first bite), like the luxuriously rich acoyote beans or chochoyotes, thick with Louisiana lump crab meat. Ana Castro, already one of the most gifted young chefs in New Orleans, really finds her voice at this stylish, seafood-focused restaurant, which she owns with her sister Lydia. It's food that excites the mind while aiming for your heart. BRETT ANDERSON
Zeeland Street
Baton Rouge, La. Southern, Cajun-Creole Opened 1992 zeelandstreet.com
Casual restaurants known through much of the South as meat-and-threes are more commonly identified as plate-lunch places in south Louisiana. Zeeland Street is a paragon of the form. The chef-owner, Stephanie Phares, learned to cook while growing up in Mississippi, where her grandmother Rachel Drain taught her scratch recipes using fresh ingredients. She's been honing those techniques for more than 30 years at Zeeland Street, where the food tastes as you would expect it to in this swampy corner of Louisiana, roughly halfway between flavor-proud New Orleans and Lafayette. Even the most familiar dishes in Ms. Phares's deep repertoire of soul-soothing staples -- from the eat-with-a-spoon smothered chicken to the gently cooked, notably meatless vegetable sides -- tastes of the kitchen's pride in preparation. BRETT ANDERSON
The Alna Store
Alna, Maine Farm-to-Table Opened 2022 thealnastore.com
On a rural crossroads covered in white clapboard, the Alna Store looks like the old-time country shop that it was for decades. But now, the shelves in back are stocked with natural wines, imported tinned fish and bracing housemade ferments (kimchi, hot sauce, curry kraut). And in front, an ambitious restaurant serves a thoroughly of-the-moment, local menu that's full of sophisticated touches without being at all pretentious. The house margarita is made with mezcal; the buttermilk wedge salad is dusted with crispy fried shallots and capers; and the shrimp topping a mound of creamy grits are coated in warm, fragrant spices, then seared until caramelized. The place is also open for brunch -- a great option if you'd prefer to take a long drive to Midcoast Maine during daylight hours. MELISSA CLARK
Ammoora
Baltimore Syrian Opened 2023 ammoora.com
Jay Salkini, the owner of this ambitious, elegant restaurant in a somewhat corporate condominium complex, and Dima Al-Chaar, the chef, want diners to taste the enchanting, multidimensional sorts of foods they grew up eating in Syria. For anyone steeped in generic Middle Eastern takeout staples, Ammoora will be a revelation. Dishes like muhammara (roasted red peppers seasoned with chile and pomegranate molasses) and kebbet karaz (minced lamb with tart cherry sauce, cinnamon and pine nuts) achieve a thrilling balance of sweet and sour, spicy and breezy. Another dish, kofta kawaj (spiced ground lamb with sweet eggplant and onions in a tomato sauce) builds in complexity and flavor as you eat. Even a familiar hummus or baklava can make you feel as if your eyes have been opened, revealing vivid new colors. ERIC ASIMOV
Somaek
Boston Korean Opened March 2024 somaek.com
In a minimalist space on a quiet side street in busy Downtown Crossing, Somaek presents Korean home cooking in all its magnificence and abundance. Chefs often say their mothers taught them to cook, but Jamie Bissonnette's jangmonim (wife's mother), Soon Han, gets full menu credit for its focused flavors. Alongside robust classics like chilled pork belly, seared beef and stir-fried squid with rice cakes, Soamaek serves a master class in banchan like chive-garlic salad, radish kimchi and pickled perilla leaf. The restaurant is named after a cold fizz of soju (clear liquor) and maekju (beer), popular for chugging and on Korean reality shows; it's just part of a full and festive bar program here. Mr. Bissonnette, a veteran of Boston's fine-dining kitchens (and the tapas juggernaut that was Toro), has built his dream chef cave, with a vinyl listening bar next door and a sushi speakeasy downstairs. JULIA MOSKIN
Noori Pocha
Clawson, Mich. Korean Opened August 2023 nooripocha.com
Walk through the door of Noori Pocha, and you'll wonder if you've found a portal to South Korea without the jet lag. Here you are, on set in Seoul, surrounded by the facades of a bus station and a market. K-pop is on the sound system, and the platters before you bear heaping, steaming plates of bulgogi, chicken buldak and jokbal. The restaurant's name comes from the Korean food carts -- pojangmacha, or pocha -- that cater to the after-work crowd with the types of dishes that sit well with a belly filled with soju. The owner In Yeol Kwon runs a franchise of the Korean fried chicken chain Noori next door, but Noori Pocha is something wholly different, with a menu from the chef Bak Sanghwan and Mr. Kwon's sister, Nali. It's rare for a restaurant to be this transporting, and rarer still to have a meal that's this much fun. SARA BONISTEEL
Oro by Nixta
Minneapolis Mexican Opened 2023 nixtampls.com
This restaurant grew out of the takeout place that itself was the offshoot of a tortilleria instrumental in elevating the quality of tacos across the Twin Cities. The common denominator of all these businesses: a passion for nixtamalized corn. Made from a multihued array of heirloom corn varieties, the supple tortillas and tamales are not inert vessels. They're the base of a menu that the chef Gustavo Romero, who owns Oro by Nixta with his wife, Kate, builds out with braised and roasted meats, in-season produce and an impressive repertoire of moles, salsas and other sauces. Imagine a taqueria with a tasting-menu restaurant's ambitions, and none of its pretensions. BRETT ANDERSON
Vinai
Minneapolis Hmong Opened July 2024 vinaimn.com
Vinai takes its name from a refugee camp in Thailand where the chef-owner Yia Vang was born, and to which his family, along with tens of thousands of fellow Hmong people, fled genocide and war. That somber story comes to life at a restaurant that is, above all else, ebullient, thanks in no small part to the affable presence of Mr. Vang. Hmong cuisine shares characteristics with the food of Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. The chef's personal take on it is arresting, packed with chile and citrus, often streaked with wood smoke, and always suffused with back story. Vinai isn't the only exciting new local restaurant showcasing the cuisine of Minnesota's sizable Hmong community. Diane's Place, a terrific, Hmong American bakery and cafe, is a short walk away. BRETT ANDERSON
Sweet Amalia Market & Kitchen
Newfield, N.J. Seafood, Sandwiches Opened 2021 sweetamalia.com
It's a farm-to-table restaurant. OK, the farm in question is an oyster-growing aquaculture operation more than 25 miles away in the Delaware Bay, but still. The place is set up like any other South Jersey roadside farm stand where you might buy a carton of eggs, a bunch of radishes and a basket of strawberries. This farm stand, though, has a raw bar, and naturally, the oysters are exceptional. There's also a counter where you can order casual, colorful plates of whatever happens to have caught the eye of Melissa McGrath, the chef, that week: a towering BLT piled with heirloom tomatoes; falafel over cucumbers and juicy yellow Sungolds; grilled eggplant sandwiches with peperonata. Certain standbys remain no matter the month, like the fried oysters on a grilled buttered roll and the Italian cold-cut hoagies. When your food is ready, you take it to one of the picnic tables outside. PETE WELLS
Blanca
New York City Tasting Menu Opened 2012, Reopened January 2024 blancanyc.com
Blanca, in Brooklyn, is the closest thing you'll find to an avant-garde restaurant among New York's tasting counters, most of which seem to make a religion of playing it safe. Not that Victoria Blamey's cooking is particularly experimental or confrontational, but it is complex and, at times, challenging. Other restaurants will juice yuzu for a precise dose of acidity; Ms. Blamey turns it into a potent sauerkraut that she drapes over clams. Blanca will fill your head with strong flavors in ways that other places charging these prices (dinner costs $ 275 and lasts about three hours) seem afraid to do. Even gentler ingredients can make your head spin: The creamy sauce for king crab grilled over charcoal is speckled with vanilla seeds, and the snails wrapped in bundles of fresh pasta are seasoned with lavender. PETE WELLS
Penny
New York City Seafood Opened March 2024 penny-nyc.com
Almost all the seating at Penny is at a long marble seafood counter broken in two. The section up front is the raw bar, where fresh oysters and clams are popped open; pink sheets of tuna are dressed with cipollini onions and olive oil; and the best shrimp cocktail you're likely to find in New York is arranged over trays of ice. The far end of the counter is where the cooking happens. Squid bodies filled with tuna and chard are carefully grilled over charcoal, and tall golden columns of puff pastry are set on top of steaming bowls of oyster pan roast. Joshua Pinsky's cooking looks simple, and in some ways it is. But whenever there's a chance to make an element of a dish better, he takes it. Taste the fresh, fluffy brioche in the ice cream sandwich (Penny's only dessert) and you'll see what I mean. PETE WELLS
Shaw-naé's House
New York City Soul Food Opened 2021 shawnaeshouse.com
The soul food at Shaw-naé's House, on Staten Island, is as high-spirited as the six-table dining room, where customers invariably skip the short wine list in favor of a house rum punch or a pitcher of sangria. Almost every dish is a party in its own right, like the Soul Fries that are buried under cheese sauce, cubes of fried chicken, spoonfuls of collard greens and molten orange heaps of warm macaroni and cheese. It's hard to imagine a soul-food restaurant without fried fish, but there's probably no other place where that means a whole snapper that's been deep-fried twice for a resounding crunch and posed upright over a small sea of crisp fresh vegetables, as if it were still swimming. Shaw-naé Dixon, the chef and owner, got her start in catering for movie shoots, and she still knows how to lay out a spread that can excite a crowd. PETE WELLS
Bungalow
New York City Indian Opened March 2024 bungalowny.com
What happens when Indian food stops trying to cater to a white audience and finally gets to be itself? You get Bungalow, a for-us-by-us restaurant, where the chef Vikas Khanna weaves ambitiously through India's lesser-known regional dishes, putting personal, creative spins on each. A Lucknowi galouti kebab is constructed with silky kidney beans that are mashed, fried and sandwiched between rounds of lotus root. The ghee roast swaps the meat for plantains, enhancing the richness and sweetness of the fruit. The lamb chops, rich yet tangy with sour mango powder, are just plain primal. Mr. Khanna is one of the most famous Indian chefs in the world, and each night he strolls through the dining room to pose for selfies and sign cookbooks. But the boldness of these flavors shows he's so much more than his celebrity charm. PRIYA KRISHNA
Good Hot Fish
Asheville, N.C. Seafood Opened January 2024 goodhotfish.com
Southern fish camp meets Black Appalachian foodways at Ashleigh Shanti's easy, walk-in restaurant in the center of the brewery-heavy South Slope district. Leave it to a former chef de cuisine to make her own versions of Old Bay and sorghum-kissed hot sauce to season thick, tender fried fillets of catfish encased in crunchy, locally milled cornmeal. Have it on squishy white bread with buttermilk tartar, or as part of a lunch plate (served on an actual school cafeteria tray) with meaty Sea Island red peas, macaroni and cheese, and some righteous round hush puppies. The sleepers: a "Ranchovy" salad built with crispy local iceberg showered with fried shallot, chives and black pepper, and a burger made from shrimp caught off the coast of North Carolina.

The Aperture
Cincinnati Mediterranean Opened January 2024 theaperturecinci.com
While the Aperture just opened this winter, it's not hard to find diners who have already made a ritual of visiting this Art Deco building for live-fire cooking from the chef-owner Jordan Anthony-Brown. The restaurant's regulars already have favorite bartenders and go-to orders like glazed hamachi collar, pita dips built from roasted vegetables, and tomato spaghetti swirled with candied chiles -- stars on a menu that reflects the kitchen's firm grasp of Mediterranean cuisine, particularly its eastern rim. For a snapshot of how fully Levantine cooking has been embraced by diners in the United States, book a table at this date-night restaurant in the city's Walnut Hills area. BRETT ANDERSON
Noche Woodfired Grill and Agave Bar
Tulsa Mexican Opened November 2023 eatdrinknoche.com
At first look, you might think Noche resembles a zillion other popular Mexican restaurants. It's sleek, festive and loud, with a crowd spilling out of the colorful dining room onto an expansive downtown patio. Beers and margaritas all around! That familiarity ends with your first bite. The complimentary chips are housemade, presented not with a generic salsa but with a purée of black beans and fruity guajillo chiles. Fiery chile heat is reserved for the shrimp aguachile, served in a bath of lime juice, radish and serranos, while Yucatán-style pork shoulder in salsa verde is like great barbecue, smoky and complex. Wrap it in blue corn tortillas. But don't forget the extensive collection of agave spirits. ERIC ASIMOV
L'Orange
Portland, Ore. Seasonal, Modern French Opened June 2023 lorangepdx.com
L'Orange is a real charmer. Occupying the second floor of a Victorian house that has variously been a telegram office and a butcher shop over the last 100-odd years, the dining room has a homey sophistication. The menu, which the chef Joel Stocks changes with the seasons, speaks French with a Pacific Northwest accent. Nestle into a chair at the six-seat chef's counter (read: bar) for a glass from the wine list curated by Jeff Vejr, a co-owner, and a couple of plates as the afternoon light fades to early evening. An ornate ruffle of shaved tête de moine cheese or the chicken liver mousse, presented in tartlet form with a strawberry and red wine gelée, will do very nicely. But so will a buckwheat crepe, amply filled with bay shrimp, Gruyère and zinged with candied jalapeño. And with nothing on the menu more than $ 30, becoming a regular is a tempting prospect.

Yaowarat
Portland, Ore. Thai Chinese Opened October 2023 yaowaratpdx.com
Inspired by Bangkok's Chinatown, the latest project from Akkapong Earl Ninsom (whose Langbaan is widely regarded as one of the best Thai restaurants in the country) is a freewheeling affair. Both the room and the food have a night-market feel. Paper lanterns and candles cast a moody light, while dishes like double-fried chive cakes, with a perfect crisp-outside-to-fluffy-inside ratio, and Yaowarat Road Squid, sloshed with fish sauce and Thai chiles, bring the bewitching depth of flavor found in the best street food. The kuay teow kua gai, chewy wide rice noodles with pork-fat chicken and a steamed egg, is a must. And a delightfully silky mapo tofu may render any other version of the dish disappointing hereafter. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Fet-Fisk
Pittsburgh Seafood Opened March 2024 fetfisk.net
Fet-Fisk is the restaurant equivalent of a cozy sweater. It feels lived in -- and not just because of the vintage platters and wood paneling. The co-founders Nik Forsberg and Sarah LaPonte have created an atmosphere, and a Nordic-inflected menu, that is refined (the bright and fennel-y seafood salad is a far cry from the gloppy picnic version) yet comfortable and unfussy. The duo started Fet-Fisk as a pop-up in 2019, and it became so beloved that Mr. Forsberg was nominated for a James Beard award in 2023 even without a brick-and-mortar spot. He and his co-chef, Csilla Thackray, can make a delicate appetizer of thin-sliced scallops and pickled strawberries feel at home alongside a rustic main of chicken brined in whey and smothered with lingonberries and fresh cheese.

Little Walter's
Philadelphia Polish, American Opened June 2024 littlewaltersphilly.com
With Fishtown already overrun with boutiques and chic restaurants, it was only a matter of time until the overflow spread to nearby East Kensington. Navigate the tight residential streets and you'll find this dimly lit, low-slung corner restaurant serving robust and deftly executed Polish cuisine. The pierogies are a nonnegotiable, of course, but there are other equally appealing dishes: the rustic sourdough served with dill butter and smalec (lard); the wieprzowina z rożna, sumptuous rotisserie pork on a bed of hearty kapusta (stewed cabbage with onions and sauerkraut); and because this is Philadelphia, a seasonal take on water ice, which at the time of this writing featured blueberries and sour cherry. NIKITA RICHARDSON
Passerine
Lancaster, Pa. French, American Opened June 2024 cafepasserine.com
To outsiders, Lancaster may evoke rolling farmland and Amish families in horse-drawn buggies, but such imagery belies a city of far more diverse and cosmopolitan tastes. (It is only 80 miles west of Philadelphia, after all.) Downtown Lancaster is an especially attractive setting for this months-old restaurant, which since June has been quietly serving outstanding dishes made with the bounty of the surrounding farmland and accented by global sensibilities. Think perfectly seared scallops set into a colorful salad of sweet summer corn and shishito peppers, or a 25-layer zucchini and goat ricotta crepe cake under a shower of ramp powder. Based on my visit in July, it's unclear whether Lancastarians know that they have an absolute gem of a restaurant in their midst. Consider this a heads-up. NIKITA RICHARDSON
Gift Horse
Providence, R.I. Korean, Seafood Opened June 2023 gifthorsepvd.com
On any given night, the shuckers behind the horseshoe bar at Gift Horse are prying open oysters grown in about a dozen spots along the Rhode Island coast. The quality of the shellfish is impressive even before you dress them with kimchi mignonette or a few jade-colored drops of hot sauce drawn from fermented green chiles. Sky Haneul Kim, the chef, reworks the traditional New England raw bar using the flavors of South Korea, where she was raised. Kimchi of crisp spring asparagus is piled over steamed littlenecks dug from Narragansett Bay. Whipped smoked fish pâté is served with puffed sheets of fried nori. Butterfish, standing in for mackerel, is broiled under a dark glaze of sweet-potato miso. Gift Horse deserves to be talked about in the same breath with Yangban in Los Angeles, Atoboy in New York and a handful of other restaurants that are busy bringing American ways of dining into the orbit of Korean cuisine.

Lost Isle
Johns Island, S.C. Southern, Global Opened December 2023 lostislechs.com
There's a party going on behind a tattered ranch house outside Charleston: a cluster of tables, under swoops of sailcloth and some improbable-looking outdoor chandeliers, where the entire menu is cooked just a few feet away over open fires of white oak. Lost Isle calls itself "a truly local experience" -- the chef, Josh Taylor, who grew up in North Georgia, leans on Lowcountry staples like collards, grits and roasted clams. Yet the big flavors he applies (chimichurri, harissa, tamarind, togarashi) evoke his world travels. And though he leads with steaks and chops, the real standouts are non-meat dishes like sweet roasted carrots amped up with chiles and brown butter. Even sweeter are the celebratory vibe, a bustling bar and the hot slabs of semolina sourdough, streaked with olive oil and char, that get the festivities started. PATRICK FARRELL
City Limits Barbeque
West Columbia, S.C. Barbecue Opened 2016 citylimitsq.com
With a cooler of free beer for people waiting in line and a big white sign with just the letters BBQ out front, City Limits is the place students of regional smoked meat dream of. Robbie Robinson, recently nominated for a James Beard award, presides. His vinegary South Carolina-style chopped pork sandwich is a master class, with crisp bits of cracklings mixed into the luscious meat, at its best topped with a proper scoop of slightly creamy, finely chopped coleslaw. He veers expertly into Texas territory, too. Snappy Hill Country sausages and meaty beef ribs sell out early. Don't sleep on the warm peach cobbler, either. The bad news? The barbecue is available only on Saturdays (with the exception of a monthly whole hog situation on Sunday). KIM SEVERSON
Bad Idea
Nashville Lao, Wine Bar Opened October 2023 badideanashville.com
Bad Idea may well be what many seasoned diners thought when they heard there was a wine bar specializing in envelope-pushing Lao food opening inside an East Nashville church. But given the level of cooking here, the name turned out to be a self-aware joke, rather than a self-own. The concept coheres in the hands of the owner, Alex Burch, a seasoned sommelier and first-time restaurateur. He had the good sense to bring on Colby Rasavong as executive chef. The former top lieutenant to Sean Brock grew up working in his Laotian family's Thai restaurant. He invests the weight of his life experience in food that stretches the boundaries of Southeast Asian cooking to the edge of Appalachia. And the wine list is wise beyond this restaurant's years, mixing tantalizing obscurities, affordable crowd pleasers and connoisseur selections you'll rarely find poured by the glass. BRETT ANDERSON
Edessa
Nashville Kurdish Opened 2018 edessarestauranttn.net
Any meal at this Kurdish restaurant should begin with an assortment of dips, ideally including the walnut-studded haydari, along with savory baked items like lavash, which comes straight from the oven, filled with hot air and covered in sesame seeds, and the spinach-and-cheese stuffed gozleme flatbread. From there, you'll have to make some hard choices. Pide, stuffed cabbage and magnificent lamb stew poured straight from its clay pot? You'll definitely want a mixed grill of kebabs and an order of cig kofte, the spicy, inscrutably delicious bulgur wheat balls. Yes, it's a lot of food, so bring friends. That's what everyone else seems to do at this convivial restaurant in the Little Kurdistan section of Nashville, home to the country's largest Kurdish population. BRETT ANDERSON
Simply South
Irving, Texas South Indian Opened February 2024 simplysouth.us
The Sunday scene here speaks volumes: The wait is three hours, the chatter of Telugu fills the space and the tables are full of bisi bele bath, filter coffee and every variety of dosa and idli you can imagine. In a former Tex-Mex restaurant on the side of Highway 635, Simply South quickly earned the blessing (and then some) of Dallas's sizable Indian population, thanks to a menu of dishes from Andhra Pradesh, in southern India, that tastes like home cooking from the chefs Venkatesawara Rao Muttavarapu, Manikandan Ramalingam and Anoop Muraleedharan. The flat discs of gunturu thatte idli, made with fermented rice, come steaming and soaked in ghee and podi, a deeply savory blend of dry lentils and chiles. There's a dosa made of nutty millet, and another, the benne dosa, that is enriched with butter. All come with six different chutneys and a sinus-awakening sambar that you'll want to guzzle from a mug. PRIYA KRISHNA
Barbs B Q
Lockhart, Texas Barbecue Opened 2023 barbsbq.com
Barbs B Q honors centuries of barbecue traditions while also bucking them. The owner, Chuck Charnichart, has an impressive résumé that includes institutions like Franklin and Goldee's, and she has opened her restaurant in the barbecue capital of Texas. But more crucially, she brings a distinct point of view that makes her food stand out in a crowded meat landscape. The pork ribs are inspired by the flavors of chamoy, the fruity, tangy condiment that she loved during her upbringing in the Rio Grande Valley, and brightened with a sprinkle of lime zest. The brisket is tender in all the right ways, with a smoky, peppery crust, but a piquant rub of chile de arbol and chile de guajillo brings an unexpected flash of heat. And the sides are not to be outdone, particularly the poblano-based green spaghetti, which tastes like fettuccine Alfredo with a huge, verdant personality. PRIYA KRISHNA
Viola and Agnes' Neo Soul Cafe
Seabrook, Texas Creole Opened 2015 neosoulfood.org
Located down the street from NASA (yes, that NASA), Viola and Agnes' Neo Soul Cafe has poor signage but big flavors. A crab claw juts thrillingly out of the gumbo, along with a cloud of white rice and several fat rounds of okra. This is a soul-food dreamscape, suffused with the flavors of the sea; salty, snappy links of andouille sausage; and fat hunks of bone-in chicken just waiting to be discovered as you dig in. The fried catfish is so long it barely fits the plate, and every bite is as crisp as the last. Puffs of cornbread disappear into the various porky, spicy stews, and into your mouth. The chef Aaron Davis -- who has Louisiana roots and named the restaurant after his grandmothers -- has spent the last few years honing this rustic Southern cooking that embodies all the delights this planet has to offer. PRIYA KRISHNA
Joon
Vienna, Va. Persian Opened June 2023 eatjoon.com
Through her award-winning cookbooks and acclaimed cooking classes, Najmieh Batmanglij has spent her 40-year career exploring the history and richness of ancient Persian and modern Iranian cuisines. In 2023, she brought these exquisite tastes to life by opening Joon (in partnership with Christopher Morgan, the ex-chef at the Middle Eastern standout Maydan) in this suburb of Washington, D.C. The cavernous space, accented in watery blues, is like a portal to another world, scented with rose water and saffron. Both are used exuberantly on the mostly classic menu, designed for sharing. Bring a crowd to savor heaping platters of lamb shoulder with fava beans and dill, duck fesenjoon with pomegranate and fried onions, and a stunning pistachio soup laced with sour orange that's both creamy and tart. MELISSA CLARK
Sumac
Sperryville, Va. Farm-to-Trailer Opened 2020 sumac-va.com
One of the best, most elegant bites I've eaten all year -- slivers of golden tilefish with juniper and whey over sticky rice -- wasn't arranged on a ceramic plate in a fancy restaurant. It wasn't served on a plate at all, but nestled into a paper bowl at a picnic table in front of Pen Druid Brewery in rural Virginia. That's how it goes at Sumac, where all the proteins, dairy, vegetables and grains are grown within a 150-mile radius and cooked over a fire in a trailer parked in a field. The setting may be rustic, but Abigail and Dan Gleason's cuisine is fiercely refined, with a menu that changes as the hyperlocal ingredients come into season, like the black walnuts paired with rabbit or the wild persimmons strewed over masa cake for dessert. MELISSA CLARK
Familyfriend
Seattle Guamanian, Filipino American Opened December 2023
It's never a bad idea to start with a killer burger. And Familyfriend's version -- a paragon of the smashed double-cheese form plied heavily with Kewpie mayo, chopped pickles and onion -- is already getting national renown. This Seattle newcomer describes itself as a "Vibe Dispensary on Beacon Hill," but lucky for the neighborhood, it doesn't stop at burgers and vibes. The owner, Elmer Dulla, is from Guam, and like the food of that island (and the team of cooks in the kitchen), the menu is proudly pan-Pacific. The diners lined up at opening time are there for the burger, sure, but also piquant chicken adobo tacos and batchoy "La Paz Style," an envelopingly unctuous noodle soup of pig offal and fermented shrimp broth. The cocktail menu is similarly laced with flavors from around the Pacific, like calamansi and salted Chinese plum. And if you don't end with the fried-to-order Typhoon Donuts with white-peach coulis, you've left your meal unfinished. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Moon Rabbit
Washington, D.C. Modern Vietnamese Opened January 2024 moonrabbitdc.com
Kevin Tien is a Vietnamese American chef from Cajun Country. Those bare facts help explain many of the flavors found in the string of well-regarded restaurants he has opened in Washington, but they only begin to capture the breadth of the cooking at Moon Rabbit. Mr. Tien co-owns this latest, most fully realized restaurant with Judy Beltrano, its co-chef, and Susan Bae, the pastry chef whose desserts you don't want to miss. The food is playfully creative, but their cooking chops are serious, as evidenced by dishes as varied as boudin-stuffed quail, luscious green curry sponge cake and pâté chaud worthy of Antonin Carême. That this collective is showcasing such excellence so close to the Capitol somehow makes everything all the more delicious. BRETT ANDERSON
Pascual
Washington, D.C. Mexican Opened January 2024 pascualdc.com
It took the chefs (and life partners) Isabel Coss and Matt Conroy several years to bring Pascual to life. The wait was well worth it. Named for the patron saint of cooks beloved in Mexico, Pascual is both homey and elegant, exuding the stylish energy of Mexico City. Many of the best dishes are inspired by Ms. Coss's upbringing in Mexico -- fideos charged with black garlic and huitlacoche, an umami-fied version of the ones she would eat after school, and the giant, airy buñuelo that fills an entire plate and comes alongside a bitter, warm chocolate sauce and toasty cajeta. No table is complete without the lamb-neck barbacoa, brined in salt and orange juice, marinated in adobo, seared over the wood fire, cooked overnight and served over creamy ayocote beans. You'll stuff the fatty, pull-apart strands of meat into homemade tortillas and understand why these chefs are in a league of their own -- not just for Mexican cooking, but all cooking. PRIYA KRISHNA

Restaurants Are Preparing to Take Diners Down a Size: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The towering burger and ballooning bagel have withstood public health campaigns, but a new movement to shrink servings is finally gaining traction.
Portion sizes in American restaurants shot up in the 1980s and never came down. The average serving of spaghetti and meatballs doubled. Bagels ballooned into six-inch-wide monstrosities. Burritos started to weigh more than a Harry Potter hardcover.
Nutritionists and policymakers haven't had much success fighting portion creep, which has been linked to health problems associated with obesity. Attempts to legislate soda sizes were shot down. Calorie counts on menus have largely gone ignored and might even be harmful. Even celebrity-dusted public health campaigns from the White House didn't move the needle much.
But today, a combo plate of economics, demographics and climate science may accomplish what years of official hand-wringing could not: loosening the grip that super-size restaurant portions have on the national diet.
Americans are not likely to break up with endless pasta bowls and half-pound burgers overnight. But the relationship has shifted significantly. More than 75 percent of customers say they want smaller portions for less money, according to the 2024 National Restaurant Association report on the industry.
Restaurants sinking under rising food costs are trying to figure out how to sell smaller servings without upsetting value-minded customers. This month, the Portion Balance Coalition, based at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, began a yearlong study to puzzle out the problem. They hope to sign on at least 10 high-volume chains like Panda Express and Chick-fil-A.
Some restaurants have already taken action. In January, Subway introduced a snack-focused menu that includes smaller bites like $ 3 hot wraps. Burger King's largest franchisee shrank its 10-piece chicken nugget order to eight. Panera Bread's You Pick Two -- a cup of soup with half a sandwich or half a salad -- is among its most popular menu items.
Chip Wade, who in 2022 left a career running Red Lobster's North America operations to become chief executive of the Union Square Hospitality Group, predicts that the restaurant industry will eventually reconsider oversize portions. "We're getting ready to get ready," he said.
Food costs aren't the only pressure on serving sizes. As much as 40 percent of food served at restaurants never gets eaten, according to a 2020 study on food waste. In an effort to slow climate change, states including California and Massachusetts have restricted how much food can end up in landfills. And millions of people taking GLP-1 drugs are eating much less than they once did.
Then there's what market researchers call "snackification." Especially among younger people, traditional meals are being replaced with snacks and small assemblages of food that approximate meals. Millennials and Gen Z-ers in particular are snacking more as a way to manage schedules that vary widely day to day, to explore bolder flavors in a low-risk way and to create more nutritionally sound diets.
On average, U.S. adults describe half the occasions they eat in a day as snacks, according to data from the Hartman Group, a market research company.
For younger diners, value is a much more complex calculus than getting the largest portion for the lowest price, said Shelley Balanko, the group's senior vice president. They care about whether a price is fair given the quality of the ingredients and cost of labor, and how much their food impacts the environment.
"When it comes to quantity," she said, "it's the right size for me or for my needs at the moment."
Customizing portion sizes should be as easy as it is for a morning coffee or a lunchtime salad, said Dana Gunders, the president of ReFED, the nation's leading organization fighting food waste and one of the groups working on the Georgetown portion study.
She'd like to see restaurants offer half-bowl options or baby burritos. "I can customize everything about my order except the size," she said. "People want this choice and they are not getting it."
Many diners already navigate their way around big portions by ordering kids' meals, sticking to appetizers or embracing restaurants that offer shareable small plates.
Meal bundles -- a collection of dishes sold in family-size portions for a slightly reduced price -- have become popular in these inflationary times. At Olive Garden, for example, a lasagna bundle with salad and breadsticks designed to serve four to six people costs about $ 59. Diners can stretch the food into several meals, or feed more people than the menu suggests.
When Abby Fammartino eats out with her husband and son, they control how much they get by under-ordering. "We may only order two things to share because we know that the portion sizes are high," she said.
As the director of health and sustainability programs and research at the Culinary Institute of America, Ms. Fammartino is coordinating the yearlong experiment with ReFED and the Portion Balance Coalition, an organization that began in 2017 and collaborates with food manufacturers, restaurant chains, researchers and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Among the questions they're asking: How can restaurants shift diners' perspectives on appropriate portion sizes? Would it help to change menu descriptions, use smaller plates or add images to show the size of each dish? How about serving fewer French fries but allowing diners to order more for free. Many diners wouldn't, but it might feel like a good deal -- and help the restaurant avoid throwing away uneaten food.
Part of the problem, researchers say, is that most people have no idea what a reasonable amount of food looks like because they have "portion distortion."
"Once you get used to larger portions, anything that looks like a normal-sized portion seems like you are getting cheated," said Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University who has researched the link between portion size and obesity. "I think it's very hard to go back. It feels awful to people."
In a 2023 experiment with three independent restaurants in Southern California, Kaiser Permanente helped create a "balanced portions" menu that featured portion sizes that nutritionists would consider reasonable. Restaurant dinner portions average about 900 to 1,500 calories, and the balanced-portion dinners are not more than 700 calories. That might include three ounces of chicken, three-quarters of a cup of rice and a couple of cups of vegetables.
The approach proved so popular that two restaurants decided to keep it. One that didn't want to change its larger portions marketed them as "dinner today, lunch tomorrow." Two new restaurants have since joined the study.
"What I like about the balanced-portion menu is that I do not have to do any mental work in ordering," one participant told the researchers. "You've done all of the homework."
Deborah Cohen, the author and research scientist who led the study, likens the battle to shrink portions to the public health campaign to get people to stop smoking, which took years. That required limiting access to cigarettes and underscoring how addictive smoking is.
Most people lack the ability to control how much they eat when they are served too much, Dr. Cohen said.
"We have to go in that direction of changing the environment, not just letting people go at it on their own," she said. "They are not likely to succeed if everything is stacked against them. It's like trying to swim in the tsunami."
But many customers like portion sizes the way they are, said Kevin Hochman, chief executive officer and president of Brinker International, which owns Chili's Grill & Bar and Maggiano's Little Italy, a chain he said was built on the concept that "Grandma always wanted you to leave overly stuffed and feeling like you can't eat any more."
For every guest who wants the chance to customize a meal, he said, there's another who doesn't want to do all that work. For every diner seeking smaller portions, there's one who wants to splurge on a hearty meal, or get the most for their money.
"There is a truth about American consumers: People want what they want," he said. "It's our job to meet guests where they are and not where we think they should be."
Chipotle Mexican Grill recently learned that portion sizes matter a lot to its customers, and not because they want smaller ones. Reviewing a Chipotle in May, the online food influencer Keith Lee complained that there wasn't enough chicken in his bowl.
His fans sprang into action, recording workers as they assembled their bowls, and walking out if the servings seemed small. When the company's chief executive, Brian Niccol, posted a video saying big portions were part of the chain's ethos, he was widely mocked. He eventually relented and told investors in a call that at least 10 percent of his restaurants were serving portions that were too small.
Jack Goldburg, the popular globe-trotting restaurant influencer behind Jack's Dining Room, joined the thousands of Chipotle critics. He's a fan of the restaurants, but he remembers when he could spend $ 14 or so there and get a feast.
"No one thinks they're going to walk into Chipotle or Sweetgreen and think, 'Yeah, this is going to be the best meal I've ever had in my life,"' he said. "What you think is, 'I'm going to spend $ 15 to $ 20 and I'm going to get the best bang for my buck.' But now you're like, 'Maybe I could just go cook the same thing and get way more food for a lot less money."'
Like others, he believes that the era of giant plates of food are over, and that quality matters more than ever.
But smaller portions may still be a tough sell. "If you go and you spend, you know, $ 20 on an appetizer and it's a couple cucumbers in a bowl," he said, "you're going to be pretty upset."

Portion sizes in American restaurants shot up in the 1980s and never came down. The average serving of spaghetti and meatballs doubled. Bagels ballooned into 6-inch-wide monstrosities. Burritos started to weigh more than a Harry Potter hardcover.
Nutritionists and policymakers haven’t had much success fighting portion creep, which has been linked to health problems associated with obesity. Attempts to legislate soda sizes were shot down. Calorie counts on menus have largely gone ignored and might even be harmful. Even celebrity-dusted public health campaigns from the White House didn’t move the needle much.
But today, a combo plate of economics, demographics and climate science may accomplish what years of official hand-wringing could not: loosening the grip that supersize restaurant portions have on the national diet.
Americans are not likely to break up with endless pasta bowls and half-pound burgers overnight. But the relationship has shifted significantly. More than 75% of customers say they want smaller portions for less money, according to the 2024 National Restaurant Association report on the industry.
Restaurants sinking under rising food costs are trying to figure out how to sell smaller servings without upsetting value-minded customers. This month, the Portion Balance Coalition, based at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, began a yearlong study to puzzle out the problem. They hope to sign on at least 10 high-volume chains like Panda Express and Chick-fil-A.
Some restaurants have already taken action. In January, Subway introduced a snack-focused menu that includes smaller bites like $3 hot wraps. Burger King’s largest franchisee shrank its 10-piece chicken nugget order to eight. Panera Bread’s You Pick Two — a cup of soup with half a sandwich or half a salad — is among its most popular menu items.
Chip Wade, who in 2022 left a career running Red Lobster’s North America operations to become CEO of the Union Square Hospitality Group, predicts that the restaurant industry will eventually reconsider oversize portions. “We’re getting ready to get ready,” he said.
Food costs aren’t the only pressure on serving sizes. As much as 40% of food served at restaurants never gets eaten, according to a 2020 study on food waste. In an effort to slow climate change, states including California and Massachusetts have restricted how much food can end up in landfills. And millions of people taking GLP-1 drugs are eating much less than they once did.
Then there’s what market researchers call “snackification.” Especially among younger people, traditional meals are being replaced with snacks and small assemblages of food that approximate meals. Millennials and Gen Z-ers in particular are snacking more as a way to manage schedules that vary widely day to day, to explore bolder flavors in a low-risk way and to create more nutritionally sound diets.
On average, U.S. adults describe half the occasions they eat in a day as snacks, according to data from the Hartman Group, a market research company.
For younger diners, value is a much more complex calculus than getting the largest portion for the lowest price, said Shelley Balanko, the group’s senior vice president. They care about whether a price is fair, given the quality of the ingredients and cost of labor, and how much their food impacts the environment.
“When it comes to quantity,” she said, “it’s the right size for me or for my needs at the moment.”
Customizing portion sizes should be as easy as it is for a morning coffee or a lunchtime salad, said Dana Gunders, the president of ReFED, the nation’s leading organization fighting food waste and one of the groups working on the Georgetown portion study.
She’d like to see restaurants offer half-bowl options or baby burritos. “I can customize everything about my order except the size,” she said. “People want this choice, and they are not getting it.”
Many diners already navigate their way around big portions by ordering kids’ meals, sticking to appetizers or embracing restaurants that offer shareable small plates.
Meal bundles — a collection of dishes sold in family-size portions for a slightly reduced price — have become popular in these inflationary times. At Olive Garden, for example, a lasagna bundle with salad and breadsticks designed to serve four to six people costs about $59. Diners can stretch the food into several meals or feed more people than the menu suggests.
When Abby Fammartino eats out with her husband and son, they control how much they get by underordering. “We may only order two things to share because we know that the portion sizes are high,” she said.
As the director of health and sustainability programs and research at the Culinary Institute of America, Fammartino is coordinating the yearlong experiment with ReFED and the Portion Balance Coalition, an organization that began in 2017 and collaborates with food manufacturers, restaurant chains, researchers and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Among the questions they’re asking: How can restaurants shift diners’ perspectives on appropriate portion sizes? Would it help to change menu descriptions, use smaller plates or add images to show the size of each dish? How about serving fewer french fries but allowing diners to order more for free? Many diners wouldn’t, but it might feel like a good deal — and help the restaurant avoid throwing away uneaten food.
Part of the problem, researchers say, is that most people have no idea what a reasonable amount of food looks like because they have “portion distortion.”
“Once you get used to larger portions, anything that looks like a normal-sized portion seems like you are getting cheated,” said Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University who has researched the link between portion size and obesity. “I think it’s very hard to go back. It feels awful to people.”
In a 2023 experiment with three independent restaurants in Southern California, Kaiser Permanente helped create a “balanced portions” menu that featured portion sizes that nutritionists would consider reasonable. Restaurant dinner portions average about 900 to 1,500 calories, and the balanced-portion dinners are not more than 700 calories. That might include 3 ounces of chicken, three-quarters of a cup of rice and a couple of cups of vegetables.
The approach proved so popular that two restaurants decided to keep it. One that didn’t want to change its larger portions marketed them as “dinner today, lunch tomorrow.” Two new restaurants have since joined the study.
“What I like about the balanced-portion menu is that I do not have to do any mental work in ordering,” one participant told the researchers. “You’ve done all of the homework.”
Deborah Cohen, the author and research scientist who led the study, likens the battle to shrink portions to the public health campaign to get people to stop smoking, which took years. That required limiting access to cigarettes and underscoring how addictive smoking is.
Most people lack the ability to control how much they eat when they are served too much, Cohen said.
“We have to go in that direction of changing the environment, not just letting people go at it on their own,” she said. “They are not likely to succeed if everything is stacked against them. It’s like trying to swim in the tsunami.”
But many customers like portion sizes the way they are, said Kevin Hochman, CEO and president of Brinker International, which owns Chili’s Grill & Bar and Maggiano’s Little Italy, a chain he said was built on the concept that “Grandma always wanted you to leave overly stuffed and feeling like you can’t eat any more.”
For every guest who wants the chance to customize a meal, he said, there’s another who doesn’t want to do all that work. For every diner seeking smaller portions, there’s one who wants to splurge on a hearty meal or get the most for their money.
“There is a truth about American consumers: People want what they want,” he said. “It’s our job to meet guests where they are and not where we think they should be.”
Chipotle Mexican Grill recently learned that portion sizes matter a lot to its customers, and not because they want smaller ones. Reviewing a Chipotle in May, online food influencer Keith Lee complained that there wasn’t enough chicken in his bowl.
His fans sprang into action, recording workers as they assembled their bowls and walking out if the servings seemed small. When the company’s CEO, Brian Niccol, posted a video saying big portions were part of the chain’s ethos, he was widely mocked. He eventually relented and told investors in a call that at least 10% of his restaurants were serving portions that were too small.
Jack Goldburg, the popular globe-trotting restaurant influencer behind Jack’s Dining Room, joined the thousands of Chipotle critics. He’s a fan of the restaurants, but he remembers when he could spend $14 or so there and get a feast.
“ No one thinks they’re going to walk into Chipotle or Sweetgreen and think, ‘Yeah, this is going to be the best meal I’ve ever had in my life,’” he said. “What you think is, ‘I’m going to spend $15 to $20, and I’m going to get the best bang for my buck.’ But now you’re like, ‘Maybe I could just go cook the same thing and get way more food for a lot less money.’”
Like others, he believes that the era of giant plates of food are over, and that quality matters more than ever.
But smaller portions may still be a tough sell. “If you go and you spend, you know, $20 on an appetizer, and it’s a couple cucumbers in a bowl,” he said, “you’re going to be pretty upset.”

Push to Defer E.U. Rules On Climate: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Leaders around the world are asking the European Union to delay rules that would require companies to police their global supply chains.
The European Union has been a world leader on climate change, passing groundbreaking legislation to reduce noxious greenhouse gasses. Now the world is pushing back.
Government officials and business groups around the globe have jacked up their lobbying in recent months to persuade E.U. officials to suspend a landmark environmental law aimed at protecting the planet's endangered forests by tracing supply chains.
The rules, scheduled to take effect at the end of the year, would affect billions of dollars in traded goods. They have been denounced as "discriminatory and punitive" by countries in Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa.
In the United States, the Biden administration petitioned for a delay as American paper companies warned that the law could result in shortages of diapers and sanitary pads in Europe. In July, China said it would not comply because "security concerns" prevent the country from sharing the necessary data.
Last week, the chorus got larger. Cabinet members in Brazil, the director general of the World Trade Organization and even Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany -- leader of the largest economy in the 27-member European Union -- asked the European Commission's president to postpone the impending deforestation regulations.
The uproar underscores the bruising difficulties of making progress on a problem that most everyone agrees is urgent: protecting the world's population from devastating climate change.
The widespread, often illegal, destruction of tropical forests and woodlands contributes to the buildup of carbon emissions and rising temperatures, increases soil erosion and flooding and destroys habitats for thousands of animals, putting them at risk of extinction.
After years of debate, lawmakers approved a ban in 2023 on all products derived from seven key commodities -- cattle, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, rubber, soybeans and wood -- cultivated on newly cleared forest land. The result are rules that affect pretty much every item used in your home, slathered on your body or put in your mouth, from living room sofas and lipstick to soap and instant noodles. Penalties for traders are steep.
The hope was that the law would have a cascading effect, spurring nations like the United States, China, India and Japan to pass similar legislation.
Yet proving that each step of a supply chain is free of ingredients linked to deforestation is formidable in a globalized world of mass production.
"Both the private sector and governments are rapidly innovating solutions," said Tina Schneider, director of forest governance at the World Resources Institute, "but the challenges remain complex and varied across both commodities and geographies."
Some countries already have monitoring systems in place. Argentina and Uruguay have been tracing cattle for more than 15 years. Ghana, one of the world's largest exporters of cocoa, has mapped 1.2 million farms so far and has said it can start tracking cocoa beans from farms to ships next month.
Several multinational food giants including Nestlé, Mars Wrigley, Mondelez and Unilever have backed the deforestation rules, while ADM announced that its verifiable supply chain for soybean oil and meal was ready.
And the United Nations Development Program, which has conducted workshops on compliance, noted that several countries including Peru and Vietnam were establishing certification systems.
Progress, though, is uneven. And officials, farmers and trade associations around the globe have complained that the law, which requires companies to map every square foot of farmland and trace the origin of every soybean or wood chip, is nearly impossible to comply with.
Even within the European Union, agricultural ministers in 20 countries, including Austria, France, Italy and Sweden, have reportedly asked for a delay.
For some countries, the response to the law is akin to passing through the seven stages of grief. Some are still in denial; many are in the anger and bargaining phases; a few have progressed to acceptance and hope.
At the same time, the law has become a flashpoint for other concerns and grievances.
Developing nations complain that former colonial powers are dictating rules that affect their economies. Small farmers worry they could be squeezed out of business by the cost of compliance. Poor and middle-income governments argue the law is another example of how they are bearing the costs of climate damage primarily caused by richer, technologically advanced nations. Politicians in Europe and the United States are responding to voters disgruntled about rising costs and regulations.
Protests by farmers across Europe this year have pushed European leaders to weaken other regulations and scale down climate goals.
The difficulties are real, supporters of the current timetable say, but not insurmountable. More important, they argue, the costs of delay are worse.
The consequences of inaction are "already being felt within the E.U. through worsening droughts and forest fires," a coalition of 170 environmental and human rights organizations wrote in a letter to Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission's president, opposing any postponement. Around the world, the letter said, "the destruction of forests and ecosystems continues unabated."
And groups of small farmers support the law, even though they could be dropped by large mills and refiners worried about being fined. Scores of civil society and farmer groups in the Ivory Coast, Indonesia and Brazil, for instance, have argued that the regulations would help make the supply chain more transparent and equitable.
"The new regulation enforcement does not create new, unachievable technical requirements," but builds on existing tracing tools and systems, a group of Brazilian organizations wrote in a letter to the European Union asking that the deadlines be enforced.
As the group pointed out, the regulations went through a process of public comment in 2020 before approval that resulted in 1.2 million responses.
A summary of the results found that a majority of stakeholders, which included business associations and nongovernmental organizations, "showed strong support for legally binding options," like deforestation-free requirements, mandatory due diligence and public certification.
Tania Li, a professor of anthropology at the University of Toronto who has studied land use in Indonesia, argues that a major hurdle has been government failures to monitor the practices of large conglomerates or support small farmers so they can be certified.
Ms. Li questioned whether requests for delay were part of good faith efforts to comply, or instead a tactic to water down or kill the regulations.
In any case, delaying the rule's onset is not easy. The legislature would have to approve any amendments to the law, said a spokesman for the European Commission.

From Crisis of Aging, a 'Silver Economy' Is Born: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For more than a decade, Li Dongmei operated a series of kindergartens and schools for young children, withstanding the realities of China's declining birthrate. She finally faced the music in 2020.
The shrinking number of children meant ever smaller enrollments of babies and toddlers at her schools. The social and economic ruptures of the Covid-19 pandemic were the breaking point, and she shifted her focus to a different and more abundant set of pupils: the elderly.
At her education center in Jinan, a city in eastern China, she now offers singing, dancing, music and art classes for seniors. She organizes activities and educational trips for her students. Unlike schoolchildren who have summer and winter holidays, Ms. Li said, older people take classes all year round. And the classes are full.
"The biggest economy is the silver economy," said Ms. Li, 36. "It is bigger than the children's market."
China's aging society is expected to deplete the vigor and vitality of the world's second-largest economy in the coming decades. But the adverse effects of demographic change are already apparent for Chinese businesses that cater to children. Many are scaling back operations or changing course.
Dairy companies that produced formula for China's infants are now developing powdered milks for seniors. Proprietors of preschools and kindergartens are closing those facilities to start senior care centers. A technology firm that made devices for parents to track their young children is now designing products allowing grown children to keep tabs on their aging mothers and fathers.
In 2022, China's population shrank for the first time since 1961. Deaths outnumbered births again last year, and the number of people age 60 and over topped 290 million, or one in every five Chinese people. China's National Health Commission estimates that the country's elderly population will grow to more than 400 million by around 2035.
To address its aging population, China announced on Friday that it had approved a plan to raise the country's statutory retirement age for the first time since the 1950s.
China has tried for years to stave off its demographic crisis. It fully lifted its one-child policy in 2016 and offered a range of incentives to encourage people to have more children. But the country's recent economic troubles have given young people more reason to question whether they can afford bigger families.
One concern is that fewer babies will lead to a smaller labor force that will whittle away at tax revenue and add stress to health care and pensions.
In a 2021 directive, China's State Council, or cabinet, called for "actively fostering the silver economy" and developing "elderly-friendly industries."
Ms. Li, the education executive who has shut her schools for children, now offers a variety of classes for seniors, including one on how to strut like fashion models on the catwalk. Ms. Li said she teaches her students how to become online influencers with lessons on creating short videos.
Also eyeing older customers, Xinjiang Tianrun Dairy, a state-owned company, acquired a smaller rival last year to focus on creating powdered milk for middle-aged and elderly consumers.
Nestlé, the Swiss food and beverage maker, cited the sharp decline in births in China last year when it announced plans to close its infant formula factory in Ireland. It and Chinese dairy firms have introduced special powdered milk products with health benefits for seniors including preventing muscle atrophy, improving sleep and helping digestion.
A leading Chinese dairy company, Yili Group, is promoting its products for seniors through television commercials. In one, a young couple buys specialized powdered milk -- without cane sugar -- as a gift for relatives at Chinese New Year.
It's not just milk. The Chinese cybersecurity firm 360 Security Technology since 2013 has been making smartwatches for kids that allow parents to contact their children and monitor their whereabouts and internet use.
In 2019, citing "the advent of an aging society," the company introduced smartwatches for seniors with features such as blood pressure and heart rate monitors, location tracking for concerned family members and one-click emergency calling.
The size of the growing seniors market is forcing the hand of Chinese companies that once targeted children and their parents, said He-Ling Shi, an associate economics professor at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.
"They have no choice," he said.
Births in China fell to nine million in 2023, down about 6 percent from the previous year. And the number of preschool children plummeted nearly 12 percent, according to China's Ministry of Education.
Last year Zhang Youlan responded to a job posting for a kindergarten teacher in Xi'an, a city in central China. When she showed up for an interview, the facility was not a kindergarten. It was a nursing home.
Ms. Zhang, a former kindergarten teacher, said she was told that the position had been advertised that way because many of the responsibilities are the same. She said her new job is similar to her old one: She leads a class in singing and dancing and teaches arts and crafts. She sends pictures of her students eating lunch to their guardians, usually their grown children.
Ms. Zhang said she had noticed that kindergartens were shutting down. More than 20,000 closed in China in 2022 and 2023, according to China's Ministry of Education, with the ranks of kindergarten teachers declining 5 percent last year.
By contrast, the senior care sector is booming. The number of elderly care facilities in China has doubled since 2018.
"It has a better future than kindergarten," Ms. Zhang said. "There are more and more elderly people and fewer and fewer children."
Cai Hao opened a maternity and baby goods store in 2018 in Shijiazhuang, a city in China's northern Hebei Province. His store initially carried clothes and footwear, for infants and toddlers.
A surge of newborns in the years after China adopted a two-child policy soon fizzled out, and the pandemic hurt foot traffic into the store.
"There were no customers," Mr. Cai said. "Without children, customers had no reason to shop here."
Then a few years ago, customers started to ask whether his store carried powdered milk for older people. Figuring he didn't have much to lose, Mr. Cai began to stock it. Sales grew so he added different varieties including one for diabetics and another for people with hypertension.
Mr. Cai said that he never made a strategic decision to start targeting older customers, but that about 10 percent of his sales now come from dairy products for seniors.
He added, "Who wouldn't be willing to sell more if they could?"

China’s ‘Silver Economy’ Is Thriving as Birthrate Plunges

SEOUL, South Korea — For more than a decade, Li Dongmei operated a series of kindergartens and schools for young children, withstanding the realities of China’s declining birthrate. She finally faced the music in 2020.
The shrinking number of children meant ever smaller enrollments of babies and toddlers at her schools. The social and economic ruptures of the COVID-19 pandemic were the breaking point, and she shifted her focus to a different and more abundant set of pupils: the elderly.
At her education center in Jinan, a city in eastern China, she now offers singing, dancing, music and art classes for seniors. She organizes activities and educational trips for her students. Unlike schoolchildren who have summer and winter holidays, Li said, older people take classes all year round. And the classes are full.
“The biggest economy is the silver economy,” said Li, 36. “It is bigger than the children’s market.”
China’s aging society is expected to deplete the vigor and vitality of the world’s second-largest economy in the coming decades. But the adverse effects of demographic change are already apparent for Chinese businesses that cater to children. Many are scaling back operations or changing course.
Dairy companies that produced formula for China’s infants are now developing powdered milks for seniors. Proprietors of preschools and kindergartens are closing those facilities to start senior care centers. A technology firm that made devices for parents to track their young children is now designing products allowing grown children to keep tabs on their aging mothers and fathers.
In 2022, China’s population shrank for the first time since 1961. Deaths outnumbered births again last year, and the number of 60-year-olds topped 290 million, or one in every five Chinese people. China’s National Health Commission estimates that the country’s elderly population will grow to more than 400 million by around 2035.

All That the Burger Can Be: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: One hundred years ago, a teenager named Lionel Sternberger dropped a blanket of American cheese over a hamburger at his father's sandwich shop in Pasadena, Calif., creating the first cheeseburger. The story may be as flimsy as a Kraft single, but it attests to the decades of tinkering and reinvention that have made the burger a lasting, ever-evolving American genre, like jazz or the Hollywood movie.
Today, burgers can come packed with the cultural ingredients that make the country what it is: regional tradition and immigrant inspiration, deep history and blue-sky creativity, plantains and gochujang and even more of that cheese. Here are 11 variations that reflect the moment -- and the limitless things a great burger can be.
The Burger Is ... Steadfast
Cheeseburger at Sun Cattle Co. in Oklahoma City
800 West Sheridan Avenue, $ 7, suncattle.com
The signature dish at Sun Cattle is not exactly innovative. It's a meticulous recreation of the fried-onion burger made famous in the diners of El Reno, about 30 miles west. Equal parts of ground beef and sliced onion are piled onto a griddle and cooked hard, creating a trinity of different onion flavors: slightly burnt, a little caramelized and almost raw -- all enveloped by the funk of beef fat. American cheese is melted on top, with a stack of pickles to finish. It's the kind of genius technique that wasn't worth messing with, said the chef, Brad Ackerman. He uses beef from a nearby ranch run by one of Sun Cattle's owners, Matt Parsons. Mr. Ackerman has no plans to change the menu seasonally or come up with non-burger innovations. "The heart of the American soul is burgers," he said.
The Burger Is ... a Taco
Campechana at Cuantas Hamburguesas in Austin, Texas
1108 East 12th Street, $ 8.75, cuantashamburguesas.com
Tacos and hamburgers are more alike than they are different. At least, that's what Beto Robledo, the owner of this food truck and its sibling, Cuantos Tacos, has always thought. Both foods, he points out, are portable, casual dishes that speak to life's simple pleasures. So why not combine them? He opened the hamburger truck in 2023, four years after the taqueria, and its signature offering is the Campechana. The burger has longaniza, diced onions, cilantro, chimichurri mayo and a beef patty splashed with the same Maggi sauce he uses to season his carne asada. A mozzarella-crusted corn tortilla known as a costra takes the place of a cheese slice. It's as if someone inserted a quesadilla into a burger, and it's marvelous.
The Burger Is ... an Ambassador
Lao Burger at Ox Burger in Seattle
1523 East Madison Street, Suite 101, $ 15, oxburgerseattle.com
When Khampaeng Panyathong first devised his Lao burger, it was as a bonus dish using ingredients prepped for his restaurant's salad station. He grabbed jeow bong -- an aromatic, labor-intensive dip typically served with sticky rice -- and thinned it into an aioli. Instead of sliced tomato, he smeared tomato jeow between two slices of provolone. He layered patties with the kitchen's cured pork belly and swapped in taro stems for lettuce, stacking it all in a glossy pub bun.
It was a burger absolutely crammed full of Lao ingredients, and for many diners visiting his restaurant Taurus Ox, it was also their first experience of Lao flavors. "They saw all these words, these unfamiliar words," said Mr. Panyathong, "but the dish was so familiar." It was also delicious, which kept customers coming back to try the chunky Lao sausage and the papaya salad made with unfiltered fish sauce. In 2023, Mr. Panyathong opened Ox Burger, a restaurant devoted to the Lao burger, which has doubled as an irresistible culinary ambassador.
The Burger Is ... Vegetarian (and Not Boring)
Made in Lagos Burger at Akara House in Brooklyn
642 Nostrand Avenue, $ 14.50, akarahouse.getsauce.com
Working as an Instacart shopper at the height of the pandemic, Funso Akinya noticed that people kept buying plant-based burgers from companies like Impossible Foods. So he bought one to try. "I was like, 'Wow, this is very terrible,' " he recalled. Surely, he thought, he could make a better vegetarian burger. He found his solution in akara, a Nigerian fritter made of peeled, mashed beans seasoned with plenty of fresh herbs, garlic and onion, and deep-fried until the outside is lightly crunchy and the interior is soft and lush.
Mr. Akinya is well-acquainted with Americans' love of burgers -- his first job when he immigrated 24 years ago was as a McDonald's cashier. Last year, he opened a Nigerian veggie-burger joint, Akara House, where the most exciting item is the Made in Lagos burger, which pairs the akara patty with two fried plantains spiced with a peanutty suya seasoning. The sweet-spicy plantains and the herby beans make a remarkably harmonious duo. "I think this is the only way to have people like our food," Mr. Akinya said. "By turning it into the burger."
The Burger Is ... Street Food
Ramly Burger at Kampar in Philadelphia
611 South Seventh Street, $ 19, kamparphilly.com
The modern hamburger may have originated in the United States, but it's just as big a sensation in Malaysia, said Ange Branca, the chef and owner of Kampar. In her homeland, street vendors duel to make the best version of the Ramly burger, a local invention with a saucy, omelet-wrapped patty and shredded cabbage. Its credited inventor is Ramly bin Mokni, who started selling halal burger patties to Malaysian vendors in the 1970s.
Ms. Branca first offered the burger during the pandemic; it sold so well that when Kampar reopened in March, she included it on the menu. The beef is enriched with Worcestershire sauce, cumin and coriander, the cheese is sharp Cheddar, the ultra-plush bun is made from sweet potatoes, and the whole thing is quite sloppy, with sambal mayonnaise dripping off the sides. "There are some customers who question, 'Why is there a burger on the menu?' Because they do expect me to be a more classical Malaysian chef," said Ms. Branca. She tells them: This is Malaysian food.
The Burger Is ... Living History
Classic Smash Burger at Hamburger America in Manhattan
51 MacDougal Street, $ 7.25, hamburgeramerica.com
The long, rich saga of the American hamburger can be found packed into this 15-stool diner in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. The owner, George Motz, is a devoted student of the dish, which he calls "one of the only truly American food inventions of the last 120 years." And the fruits of his research are on display: the photos of classic diners lining the walls, the printed menu above the counter (mimicking the one at Convention Grill in Edina, Minn.), and the "No newspapers or laptops at counter" sign, a homage to White Hut in Springfield, Mass. The classic smash burger at Hamburger America, which opened last November, is the same, thrillingly simple one Mr. Motz has been making at pop-ups for years -- a thin, crisp-edged patty, a melting slice of American cheese and a generously buttered and toasted Martin's potato roll. To further his mission of spreading burger knowledge, each month Mr. Motz flies in an owner of a renowned diner -- like Solly's Grille in Glendale, Wis., or Weston's Kewpee Sandwich Shop in Lansing, Mich. -- to give customers a delicious lesson in history.
The Burger Is ... Limited-Edition
Double Smash Burger at Burger Bodega in Houston
4520 Washington Avenue, $ 9.95, burgerbodega.com
As a Houston teenager, Abbas Dhanani spent many hours standing in line to buy the latest special-edition sneaker. Now crowds wait patiently at Burger Bodega for his limited-edition burger collaborations. Mr. Dhanani, whose family owns about 500 Burger King and 400 Wendy's franchises throughout the United States, partners with local chefs and TikTok influencers to create short-run specials like chapli burgers and beef rendang smash burgers. During Ramadan last year, he and an aunt who runs a catering business staged a pop-up for Suhoor selling cheeseburger samosas. Burger Bodega's double smash burger, with its caramelized, almost pizzelle-like (and halal) beef skirt, is available year-round but still a hot seller. It tastes the way a fast-food burger should, but rarely does.
The Burger Is ... a Mess (in a Good Way)
Lucy Goosey at Hot Dish Pantry in Milwaukee
4125 South Howell Avenue, $ 14, hotdishpantry.com
Midwesterners are a measured lot, especially when it comes to food. Chefs mess with classics like the beefy Tater Tot-covered casserole called hot dish at their peril. But the Wisconsinites Nathan Heck and Laura Maigatter have bravely waded into their region's culinary canon at their restaurant, Hot Dish Pantry, where standards like pierogi come dressed up like aloo chaat, and the classic pounded pork tenderloin sandwich has an eggplant cousin. Their cheese-stuffed Lucy Goosey -- with Wisconsin Cheddar sealed between two beef patties -- was inspired by the Juicy Lucy, a drippy burger with a molten core of American cheese that was invented in a Minneapolis bar in the 1950s.
While the original sits on a soft bun, topped only with fried onions or a few pickles, the Lucy Goosey is dressed like a more traditional burger on a toasted brioche bun, with lettuce, raw onions, tomato and pickles. A gooey slice of American cheese on top underscores the cheesy concept, and yellow mustard and a squeeze of mayo finish things up. If you're lucky, a bit of the Cheddar will have leaked out and hit the grill, crisping up into a Midwestern frico. KIM SEVERSON
The Burger Is ... Proudly Local
Cholms Single at Cholms Burger in Bozeman, Mont.
319 North Seventh Avenue, $ 7, instagram.com/cholmsburger
A buttered, toasted potato roll, a slice of melting American cheese and a three-ounce patty, pressed against the grill so its edges brown: It doesn't sound radical, but in a cattle-rich state that paradoxically imports most of its meat from as far away as Brazil, Cory Taber has developed and refined his simple hamburger in symbiosis with a local butcher shop, Daniel's Gourmet Meats. Daniel's processes beef from ranchers in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho and, in a custom blend for Mr. Taber, grinds in a portion of smoky bacon ends.
Mr. Taber says he aims to keep prices low in an increasingly expensive tourist town, where his trailer is a welcoming spot for fellow food service workers, local families and students. As he tells it, his love of burgers is just as homegrown: "I grew up with a single mom; she was a bartender. When she couldn't find a babysitter, she'd bring me to work and I'd see cooks smashing balls of beef on the flattop all night long. The smash burger wasn't trendy, it was just good."
The Burger Is ... Expansive
Amelia's Frita at Amelia's 1931 in Miami
13601 Southwest 26th Street, $ 18, amelias1931.com
Any Miami restaurant famous for Cuban comfort food will offer its version of the frita, a Cuban-style smash burger topped with fried potato strings that spill over the sides of a Cuban roll. The chef Eileen Andrade resisted putting a frita on her menu, but her mother, Nancy Andrade, who runs Islas Canarias, persuaded her to embrace its popularity. Ms. Andrade did it her own way, referencing both her Korean and Peruvian culinary training. Her frita starts with a beef and chorizo patty, marinated in sesame oil, sweet chile sauce and gochujang. It's topped with Gruyère, crispy fried potato strings and diced sweet plantains, slicked with a Peruvian huacatay mayo and served on a housemade Cuban bun. It's a substantial and idiosyncratic take on the frita, which dates back to the 1920s, when vendors sold them from roadside pushcarts in Havana. CARLOS FRÍAS
The Burger Is ... the Next Generation
Laab Smash Burger at Ban Ban Burger in Los Angeles
1644 Sawtelle Boulevard, No. 3149, $ 13, instagram.com/banbanburger
The sisters Katy Noochlaor and Amanda Maneesilasan grew up in their family's restaurant, Chao Krung, a Los Angeles fixture in the 1970s, before Thai food businesses, markets and bakeries flourished in the city. In an effort to distinguish their work from their parents', they opened Ban Ban Burger in April. The shop reimagines dishes like krapow and laab as nostalgic, paper-wrapped smash burgers that look and taste as if they've always existed. For the krapow smash burger, a thick smear of garlic, holy basil and hot bird's-eye chiles is slathered on the patty. As you eat it, the fried egg breaks, covering the thin patty in runny yolk. The laab burger is seasoned with an aromatic paste of fresh lemongrass, makrut lime, mint, chiles and toasted rice powder. It's all held together, appropriately, by a sticky slice of American cheese.

The signature dish at Sun Cattle is not exactly innovative. It’s a meticulous recreation of the fried-onion burger made famous in the diners of El Reno, about 30 miles west. Equal parts of ground beef and sliced onion are piled onto a griddle and cooked hard, creating a trinity of different onion flavors: slightly burnt, a little caramelized and almost raw — all enveloped by the funk of beef fat. American cheese is melted on top, with a stack of pickles to finish. It’s the kind of genius technique that wasn’t worth messing with, said the chef, Brad Ackerman. He uses beef from a nearby ranch run by one of Sun Cattle’s owners, Matt Parsons. Ackerman has no plans to change the menu seasonally or come up with non-burger innovations. “The heart of the American soul is burgers,” he said.

The Burger Is … a Taco
Campechana at Cuantas Hamburguesas
Tacos and hamburgers are more alike than they are different. At least, that’s what Beto Robledo, the owner of this food truck and its sibling, Cuantos Tacos, has always thought. Both foods, he points out, are portable, casual dishes that speak to life’s simple pleasures. So why not combine them? He opened the hamburger truck in 2023, four years after the taqueria, and its signature offering is the Campechana. The burger has longaniza, diced onions, cilantro, chimichurri mayo and a beef patty splashed with the same Maggi sauce he uses to season his carne asada. A mozzarella-crusted corn tortilla known as a costra takes the place of a cheese slice. It’s as if someone inserted a quesadilla into a burger, and it’s marvelous.

The Burger Is … an Ambassador
Lao Burger at Ox Burger
When Khampaeng Panyathong first devised his Lao burger, it was as a bonus dish using ingredients prepped for his restaurant’s salad station. He grabbed jeow bong — an aromatic, labor-intensive dip typically served with sticky rice — and thinned it into an aioli. Instead of sliced tomato, he smeared tomato jeow between two slices of provolone. He layered patties with the kitchen’s cured pork belly and swapped in taro stems for lettuce, stacking it all in a glossy pub bun.
It was a burger absolutely crammed full of Lao ingredients, and for many diners visiting his restaurant Taurus Ox, it was also their first experience of Lao flavors. “They saw all these words, these unfamiliar words,” said Panyathong, “but the dish was so familiar.” It was also delicious, which kept customers coming back to try the chunky Lao sausage and the papaya salad made with unfiltered fish sauce. In 2023, Panyathong opened Ox Burger, a restaurant devoted to the Lao burger, which has doubled as an irresistible culinary ambassador.

The Burger Is … Vegetarian (and Not Boring)
Made in Lagos Burger at Akara House
Working as an Instacart shopper at the height of the pandemic, Funso Akinya noticed that people kept buying plant-based burgers from companies like Impossible Foods. So he bought one to try. “I was like, ‘Wow, this is very terrible,’” he recalled. Surely, he thought, he could make a better vegetarian burger. He found his solution in akara, a Nigerian fritter made of peeled, mashed beans seasoned with plenty of fresh herbs, garlic and onion, and deep-fried until the outside is lightly crunchy and the interior is soft and lush.
Akinya is well-acquainted with Americans’ love of burgers — his first job when he immigrated 24 years ago was as a McDonald’s cashier. Last year, he opened a Nigerian veggie-burger joint, Akara House, where the most exciting item is the Made in Lagos burger, which pairs the akara patty with two fried plantains spiced with a peanutty suya seasoning. The sweet-spicy plantains and the herby beans make a remarkably harmonious duo. “I think this is the only way to have people like our food,” Akinya said. “By turning it into the burger.”

The Burger Is … Street Food
Ramly Burger at Kampar
The modern hamburger may have originated in the United States, but it’s just as big a sensation in Malaysia, said Ange Branca, the chef and owner of Kampar. In her homeland, street vendors duel to make the best version of the Ramly burger, a local invention with a saucy, omelet-wrapped patty and shredded cabbage. Its credited inventor is Ramly bin Mokni, who started selling halal burger patties to Malaysian vendors in the 1970s.
Branca first offered the burger during the pandemic; it sold so well that when Kampar reopened in March, she included it on the menu. The beef is enriched with Worcestershire sauce, cumin and coriander, the cheese is sharp cheddar, the ultra-plush bun is made from sweet potatoes, and the whole thing is quite sloppy, with sambal mayonnaise dripping off the sides. “There are some customers who question, ‘Why is there a burger on the menu?’ Because they do expect me to be a more classical Malaysian chef,” Branca said. She tells them: This is Malaysian food.

The Burger Is … Living History
Classic Smash Burger at Hamburger America
The long, rich saga of the American hamburger can be found packed into this 15-stool diner in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. The owner, George Motz, is a devoted student of the dish, which he calls “one of the only truly American food inventions of the last 120 years.” And the fruits of his research are on display: the photos of classic diners lining the walls, the printed menu above the counter (mimicking the one at Convention Grill in Edina, Minnesota), and the “No newspapers or laptops at counter” sign, an homage to White Hut in Springfield, Massachusetts. The classic smash burger at Hamburger America, which opened in November, is the same, thrillingly simple one Motz has been making at pop-ups for years — a thin, crisp-edged patty, a melting slice of American cheese and a generously buttered and toasted Martin’s potato roll. To further his mission of spreading burger knowledge, each month Motz flies in an owner of a renowned diner — like Solly’s Grille in Glendale, Wisconsin, or Weston’s Kewpee Sandwich Shop in Lansing, Michigan — to give customers a delicious lesson in history.

The Burger Is … Limited-Edition
Double Smash Burger at Burger Bodega
As a Houston teenager, Abbas Dhanani spent many hours standing in line to buy the latest special-edition sneaker. Now crowds wait patiently at Burger Bodega for his limited-edition burger collaborations. Dhanani, whose family owns about 500 Burger King and 400 Wendy’s franchises throughout the United States, partners with local chefs and TikTok influencers to create short-run specials like chapli burgers and beef rendang smash burgers. During Ramadan last year, he and an aunt who runs a catering business staged a pop-up for Suhoor selling cheeseburger samosas. Burger Bodega’s double smash burger, with its caramelized, almost pizzelle-like (and halal) beef skirt, is available year-round but still a hot seller. It tastes the way a fast-food burger should, but rarely does.

The Burger Is … a Mess (in a Good Way)
Lucy Goosey at Hot Dish Pantry
Midwesterners are a measured lot, especially when it comes to food. Chefs mess with classics like the beefy Tater Tot-covered casserole called hot dish at their peril. But Wisconsinites Nathan Heck and Laura Maigatter have bravely waded into their region’s culinary canon at their restaurant, Hot Dish Pantry, where standards like pierogi come dressed up like aloo chaat, and the classic pounded pork tenderloin sandwich has an eggplant cousin. Their cheese-stuffed Lucy Goosey — with Wisconsin cheddar sealed between two beef patties — was inspired by the Juicy Lucy, a drippy burger with a molten core of American cheese that was invented in a Minneapolis bar in the 1950s.
While the original sits on a soft bun, topped only with fried onions or a few pickles, the Lucy Goosey is dressed like a more traditional burger on a toasted brioche bun, with lettuce, raw onions, tomato and pickles. A gooey slice of American cheese on top underscores the cheesy concept, and yellow mustard and a squeeze of mayo finish things up. If you’re lucky, a bit of the cheddar will have leaked out and hit the grill, crisping up into a Midwestern frico. — KIM SEVERSON

The Burger Is … Proudly Local
Cholms Single at Cholms Burger
A buttered, toasted potato roll, a slice of melting American cheese and a 3-ounce patty, pressed against the grill so its edges brown: It doesn’t sound radical, but in a cattle-rich state that paradoxically imports most of its meat from as far away as Brazil, Cory Taber has developed and refined his simple hamburger in symbiosis with a local butcher shop, Daniel’s Gourmet Meats. Daniel’s processes beef from ranchers in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho and, in a custom blend for Taber, grinds in a portion of smoky bacon ends.
Taber says he aims to keep prices low in an increasingly expensive tourist town, where his trailer is a welcoming spot for fellow food service workers, local families and students. As he tells it, his love of burgers is just as homegrown: “I grew up with a single mom; she was a bartender. When she couldn’t find a babysitter, she’d bring me to work and I’d see cooks smashing balls of beef on the flattop all night long. The smash burger wasn’t trendy, it was just good.”

The Burger Is … Expansive
Amelia’s Frita at Amelia’s 1931
Any Miami restaurant famous for Cuban comfort food will offer its version of the frita, a Cuban-style smash burger topped with fried potato strings that spill over the sides of a Cuban roll. Chef Eileen Andrade resisted putting a frita on her menu, but her mother, Nancy Andrade, who runs Islas Canarias, persuaded her to embrace its popularity. Eileen Andrade did it her own way, referencing both her Korean and Peruvian culinary training. Her frita starts with a beef and chorizo patty, marinated in sesame oil, sweet chile sauce and gochujang. It’s topped with Gruyère, crispy fried potato strings and diced sweet plantains, slicked with a Peruvian huacatay mayo and served on a housemade Cuban bun. It’s a substantial and idiosyncratic take on the frita, which dates back to the 1920s, when vendors sold them from roadside pushcarts in Havana. — CARLOS FRÍAS

The Burger Is … the Next Generation
Laab Smash Burger at Ban Ban Burger
Sisters Katy Noochlaor and Amanda Maneesilasan grew up in their family’s restaurant, Chao Krung, a Los Angeles fixture in the 1970s, before Thai food businesses, markets and bakeries flourished in the city. In an effort to distinguish their work from their parents’, they opened Ban Ban Burger in April. The shop re-imagines dishes like krapow and laab as nostalgic, paper-wrapped smash burgers that look and taste as if they’ve always existed. For the krapow smash burger, a thick smear of garlic, holy basil and hot bird’s-eye chiles is slathered on the patty. As you eat it, the fried egg breaks, covering the thin patty in runny yolk. The laab burger is seasoned with an aromatic paste of fresh lemon grass, makrut lime, mint, chiles and toasted rice powder. It’s all held together, appropriately, by a sticky slice of American cheese.

Left Sows Misinformation of Its Own: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: America's right flank remains the chief purveyor of misinformation, but this summer's political tumult created ideal conditions for falsehoods to spread among progressives.
Several elected officials, along with a top political aide for the billionaire Reid Hoffman, recently suggested, without proof, that former President Donald J. Trump may have staged an attempt to assassinate him in July.
Mark Hamill, an actor and advocate for Democratic causes with more than five million followers on X, criticized a conservative policy proposal by railing against ideas that were not part of the document.
And last month, Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential campaign misleadingly suggested, in posts viewed millions of times, that Mr. Trump was confused about his whereabouts during a campaign stop. Her followers seized on the posts to claim that Mr. Trump was suffering from cognitive decline.
For years, the discussion about misinformation online has focused on falsehoods circulating on the American right. But in recent weeks, a flurry of conspiracy theories and false narratives have also been swirling on the left.
Some misinformation researchers are worried that the new spate of left-leaning conspiracy theories could further polarize political discourse before the November election. More than one-third of President Biden's supporters believed the assassination attempt may have been staged, according to a poll in July by Morning Consult.
"I don't anticipate that we will collectively become less conspiratorial," said Adam Enders, an associate professor of political science at the University of Louisville. "If anything, the closer we get to Election Day, the more it'll increase."
The researchers emphasized that the falsehoods and exaggerations were not as entrenched or as toxic as those permeating right-wing spaces online. Several studies have shown that the political right is more likely to share false narratives and misinformation. Researchers at Northeastern University found that Democrats were generally better than Republicans at discerning true from false news.
This is not, however, the first time misinformation has circulated on the left. In 2004, for example, a contingent of disheartened Democrats claimed that President George W. Bush's re-election over Senator John Kerry had been marred by election fraud. Experts quickly issued rebuttals to the accusations.
Neither Mark Hamill nor the Harris campaign provided a comment for this article. Mr. Hoffman's aide apologized for questioning whether the assassination attempt against Mr. Trump had been staged. He parted ways with the billionaire soon after.
The shooting at the Pennsylvania rally became a lightning rod for conspiracy theories almost as soon as shots were fired. Unfounded rumors that Mr. Trump had staged his own shooting festered into lasting conspiracy theories, which are still shared both by anonymous users and by liberal influencers with hundreds of thousands of social media followers.
Secret Service agents, some popular influencers on X and Threads have claimed, were in on the plan. The blood from the bullet that hit Mr. Trump's ear was actually ketchup, others theorized. Never mind that there was no evidence behind these claims.
Mentions of the word "staged" surged on X in the days after the shooting, with more than 300,000 mentions, according to a report by NewsGuard, a company that monitors online misinformation. Many users claimed the shooting had been staged, while others criticized the idea as preposterous. Some left-leaning users who shared conspiracy theories about the assassination attempt saw their number of followers grow, sometimes substantially, NewsGuard found.
Joy Reid, a host on MSNBC with more than 340,000 followers on Threads, raised questions about Mr. Trump's injury from the shooting, doubts that some of her followers interpreted, when his medical details were not released, as implying a cover-up. Majid M. Padellan, who is known as "Brooklyn Dad Defiant" on X and has more than 1.3 million followers, amplified such suspicions by offering his own doubts about Mr. Trump's injury. (The F.B.I. later said a bullet had struck Mr. Trump.)
MSNBC did not respond to requests for comment. In an emailed response, Mr. Padellan defended his questions about the nature and treatment of Mr. Trump's injury and about Secret Service actions that day.
The assassination attempt sparked a similar wave of conspiracy theories from America's right flank -- echoed by prominent Republicans -- including that Democrats had ordered the attack. As the presidential campaign continued, Ms. Harris was targeted by a barrage of racist and sexist falsehoods from conservatives, who have also invented falsehoods about Gov. Tim Walz, her running mate from Minnesota. Mr. Trump has personally unleashed a barrage of disproven claims in just the past month.
Research has shown that Mr. Trump plays an important role in spreading falsehoods on the right, acting as a megaphone that prompts influencers and politicians to spread falsehoods in lock step with one another. Left-wing misinformation, in contrast, tends to spread more loosely and organically among a varied collection of users and organizations, researchers have found.
"There's just a world of difference between what you're hearing episodically out of the left and the systemic production of pretty vile and dangerous stuff that we have seen now for years coming out of that right-wing ecosystem," said Steven Livingston, the founding director of the Institute for Data, Democracy and Politics at George Washington University.
Researchers believe the whiplash of the current campaign season helped create the ideal conditions for voters of all political persuasions to feel distrustful and bewildered. Conspiracy theories tend to take hold in moments of distress and upheaval, research has shown.
"When you're presented with information you don't really know what to do with, you fill in the narrative blanks," said Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor of media ethics and digital platforms at the University of Oregon.
Social media have become a major source of news for many Americans, allowing voters to nestle into their own ideological silos, which prize virality -- and exaggeration -- over nuance. Fact-checkers and their peers, meanwhile, are struggling to make a dent in misinformation while fighting for more support.
These conditions have paved the way for even bizarre claims to catch national attention. A vulgar, untrue joke about Senator JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, spread rapidly after he was added to the ticket, with nearly 400,000 mentions and 4.6 million interactions from July 15 to July 31, according to online and social media data analyzed by Hootsuite. The joke became fodder for late-night television hosts and even for the Harris campaign, which alluded to it on social media and during a rally.
Articles debunking left-wing misinformation have faced pushback online from critics and journalism watchdogs, who have claimed that the traditional fact-checking process is not suited to tackling falsehoods from the left. The Associated Press was roundly mocked online for trying to debunk the joke by writing a staid fact check that was soon deleted. The news agency said that the fact check had not gone through its "standard editing process."
"Since most of what Democrats are saying is provably -- or at least arguably -- true, fact-checkers have descended to hairsplitting at best and worst," wrote Dan Froomkin, the founder of Press Watch, a nonprofit website covering political journalism.
Snopes, the fact-checking website, is used to seeing pushback over its frequent debunking of right-wing disinformation. But since the war started between Israel and Gaza -- and through this year's presidential election -- the website has also faced scrutiny after running fact-check articles about left-wing falsehoods, according to Doreen Marchionni, the executive and managing editor for the site.
"We kind of get hit by all sides whenever what we report doesn't conform to certain left or right talking points," she said.

Michel Guérard, 91, Who Cut the Calories In Haute Cuisine, Dies: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Appalled by the food options available to those seeking to lose weight, he developed a form of nouvelle cuisine for dieters at a spa in southwestern France.
Michel Guérard, a driving force behind the 1960s culinary movement known as nouvelle cuisine and the creator of the enormously influential "slimming cuisine" at his 19th-century spa in Eugénie-les-Bains, France, died at his home there. He was 91.
His daughters, Eléonore and Adeline, said that he died overnight between Sunday and Monday.
Mr. Guérard was already recognized as one of the most daring and innovative chefs in France, in 1974, when he took over Les Prés d'Eugénie, one of the smaller, less developed properties in a chain owned by the family of his wife, Christine. Together, the couple turned the spa into a major tourist destination, despite its remote location in southwestern France, in large part because of what Mr. Guérard called "cuisine minceur," a low-fat, no-starch, no-sugar, low-calorie application of nouvelle cuisine. (Guests could also go for the full-fat, lavish experience on the other half of the menu if they liked.)
His own efforts to lose weight at the spa, and his disgust with traditional diet dishes, inspired him to develop dishes that relied on vegetable purées combined with low-calorie fromage blanc for sauce, rather than butter and cream. Rather than sautéing in oil or butter, he steamed fish and meats in sealed containers with herbs to infuse and retain flavor.
He regarded traditional spa cuisine, which was imposed on him when he first visited Eugénie and needed to lose 15 pounds, as additional pain for patients already struggling with the rigors of weight-loss regimens. "The punishment was too severe to be borne," he wrote in "Michel Guérard's Cuisine Minceur" (1976), "evasive action had to be taken."
To put pleasure back into the equation, he created dishes like mousseline of crayfish with watercress sauce, leg of milk-fed lamb cooked in wild hay, and a 60-calorie pear soufflé "as light and fragrant as hickory smoke," in the words of the Washington Post food writer William Rice.
"The point of slimming cuisine is that it is delicious," Mr. Guérard told the website European Food in 2017. "You don't feel like you're making a sacrifice. Moreover, you eat what you need. You are not starved." Without sacrificing flavor, he drastically pared down calorie counts.
He pulled off the neat trick of slimming down the veal stew known as blanquette de veau from the usual 1,000 calories to a slender 250 by eliminating butter, cream and egg yolks. Instead, he steamed the veal with carrots, cress, celery root and mushrooms and then whipped up a low-calorie béarnaise sauce using the cooking liquid and fromage blanc.
"My attitude towards food did not make sense to chefs at the time," he told Time magazine in 2017. "I was at worst an outcast and at best a crazy cook."
The skeptics soon came around. Paul Bocuse, after harboring doubts, was quoted as calling Mr. Guérard "the most imaginative of us all" in a 1975 profile of Mr. Guérard in The New Yorker. Daniel Boulud told Bloomberg.com in 2016: "Out of all the chefs I ever worked with, Guérard had the greatest sensibility and was the most poetic. The way he engaged his cooks always led us toward a kind of creativity that was never conventional."
Mr. Guérard's cookbook, published in France as "La Grande Cuisine Minceur," became a best seller there, and his growing reputation propelled him to the cover of the European edition of Time in 1976, under the headline "The New Gourmet Law: Hold the Butter." A year later, the Michelin Guide awarded Les Prés d'Eugénie three stars, a rating it has maintained ever since.
Michel Etienne Robert-Guérard was born on March 27, 1933, in Vétheuil, about 40 miles northwest of Paris, and grew up after the age of 6 in Pavilly, outside Rouen, where his parents, Maurice and Georgine (Boulanger) Robert-Guérard ran a butcher shop. He attended the Lycée Pierre Corneille, a secondary school in Rouen, but left at 16 to become an apprentice pastry chef under a prestigious caterer, Kléber Alix, in Mantes-la-Jolie, 35 miles northwest of Paris.
After completing his military service in the Navy, which he spent cooking for an officers' mess in Cherbourg, he found work as a pastry chef at the Hôtel de Crillon in Paris and in 1958 passed the grueling series of tests required for the title Meilleur Ouvrier de France (finest craftsman in France). At the time, he was the youngest chef to have received that honor. Soon after, he left the Crillon to work at Le Lido, a splashy cabaret and restaurant frequented by international celebrities.
In 1965, Mr. Guérard bought a tiny rundown bistro, which he renamed the Pot-au-Feu, in Asnières-sur-Seine, just outside Paris. The neighborhood was dodgy. In the early days, he sold sandwiches to workers at a nearby rivet factory. The clientele included a fair share of gangsters.
Encouraged by his friend Jean Delaveyne, a wildly inventive chef who inspired a number of nouvelle cuisine chefs, he created what he called an "alchemist's laboratory." He scandalized critics by pouring a vinaigrette over foie gras in his signature salade gourmande, much copied and popularly known as "crazy salad." Saltwater fish steamed under seaweed, later a feature at Eugénie-les-Bains, also originated at the Pot-au-Feu.
"I was never satisfied until I had an answer to everything," he told The New Yorker in 1975. "I always asked myself, Why am I doing this and that? Once I knew, there seemed no point in more reading. I closed all the cookbooks. I crossed the border and went my own way."
The Pot-au-Feu was awarded a Michelin star two years after opening and a second star in 1971. The Gault-Millau guide called it "the best suburban bistro in the world."
A road-widening project forced the restaurant to close in 1974; in the meantime, Mr. Guérard had met and married Christine Barthélémy, who whisked him away to Eugénie-les-Bains. She died in 2017. In addition to his daughters, who run the family spa business, the Chaîne Thermale du Soleil, he is survived by three grandchildren.
Mr. Guérard undertook a number of side ventures over the course of his career. In the late 1960s, the singer and nightclub impresario Régine Zylberberg invited him to run the kitchen at her Russian-themed cabaret Le Réginskaïa; she later brought him to New York to direct the kitchen at Régine's. In the late 1970s, he worked with the research and development department of Nestlé to develop frozen entrees, notably a fish version of the flaky almond pastry known as a pithivier and deluxe ice creams. He created a specialty food store, Le Comptoir Gourmand, opening branches in Paris and Lyon before setting up shop in Bloomingdale's, in New York, in 1981.
Mr. Guérard was the author of "La Cuisine Gourmande" (1978). "Mémoire de la Cuisine Française" (2020), a book based on a series of interviews conducted by Benoît Peeters, was published in 2020. In 2013 he created a school, the Institut Michel Guérard, to provide training in the principles of healthy cooking.
He remained at the stove well into his 80s, constantly revisiting and revising his menus. "When I'm brushing my teeth, when I'm driving my car," he told Bloomberg, "I'm always thinking of new dishes."

Full text: In Counterculture San Francisco, a Church Has Become the Place to Be
We're exploring how America defines itself one place at a time. In San Francisco, a city that loves the new, many residents are flocking to an old cathedral.
San Francisco residents have always celebrated the new, the innovative, the cutting-edge. The weirder, the better. But these days, they are flocking to a surprising venue for the cool factor: a church that is older than the city itself.
High atop Nob Hill, above the clanging cable cars and luxury hotels, stands the majestic Grace Cathedral. The Episcopal congregation dates back to 1849, the year before the city was incorporated, when pews were filled with miners tossing gold dust into the offering plates at a precursor to the current building.
The Gothic cathedral, built in 1927 for the same congregation, has for decades been home to traditional religious rites and events: Sunday services, baptisms, weddings, funerals and Christmas choral performances. But in the past few years, it has boomed for reasons that have nothing to do with the Bible. Just the other week, a public art display featuring colorful lasers beamed from the roof of the nearby Fairmont Hotel into the big, round window at the front of the cathedral. The event drew more than 1,000 onlookers, including Sergey Brin, the billionaire co-founder of Google, and Kudra Kalema, a Ugandan prince and tech founder.
Kanye West, the rapper, has visited the cathedral during quiet hours to play the organ. Bobby McFerrin, the singer made famous by his 1988 hit, "Don't Worry, Be Happy," regularly leads cathedral goers in improvised song circles.
But it's not just star power fueling the interest in Grace. In a city where office buildings remain among the emptiest in the nation, many remote workers in San Francisco are longing for a real-world community.
Two years ago, the San Francisco cathedral created Grace Arts, a program designed like a museum membership that charges an annual fee in exchange for benefits that include discounts on classes and events.
It has proven so popular that Grace Arts members now outnumber regular church members. About 820 households subscribe to Grace Arts, compared with 550 churchgoing households. Annual surveys show the average age of a Grace participant has dropped from 63 to 40 in just two years, signaling the new program is drawing a younger crowd.
Kimberly Porter-Leite volunteers at the cathedral's twice-weekly yoga classes, sessions so popular she has to perform what she calls "mat Tetris" to ensure everybody fits between the columns and pews. The fire department has even required the cathedral to block off an open path with colorful cones so that the yogis can get out in an emergency, she said.
Ms. Porter-Leite, wearing black leggings and heart socks at a recent session, said she felt incredibly lonely during the pandemic, a hole made worse by the death of her mother.
She is not religious and is married to a woman she described as "a recovering Catholic" who felt mistreated by the church for being a lesbian. A cathedral was an unlikely place for her to spend her time, but she lives nearby and knew that Grace had a reputation for being liberal and welcoming. In 2021, she tried out a yoga class and was hooked.
"This place was a lifeline for me," she said. "It is so weird and quirky and lovely and inclusive. It was such a relief."
Darren Main has taught yoga classes at the cathedral for many years but said they used to be small and only recently have swelled. He, too, is gay and felt shamed by the Catholic church in which he was raised.
"A lot of people here left the church, not feeling particularly welcome or safe," he said. "But we still need a space where we can be together for some reason besides bickering about politics."
Others are finding community and joy at the cathedral by packing monthly sound baths, where they nestle into their sleeping bags to listen to musicians play by candlelight. They are dancing in the pews at tribute concerts to Sting, Queen -- and, of course, Taylor Swift.
They are joining tours that allow them to venture into nooks of the cathedral that were long barred to visitors -- including the closets where the bishop's vestments are kept, the bell tower and the catwalks overlooking large stained glass windows featuring biblical scenes in vibrant colors. In some areas, the clearance is so low, visitors must don hard hats.
The cathedral has even hosted carnivals, drag queens and trapeze artists swinging from its soaring ceilings.
"Crazy San Francisco! Isn't it great?" joked the Very Rev. Malcolm Clemens Young, the dean of Grace Cathedral, who regularly ditches his collar for a T-shirt and shorts at yoga class.
The groundswell of interest may seem unlikely in a city known for its counterculture and where organized religion is not a focus of many residents' lives -- except on Easter Sunday when they pack the hills of Dolores Park for the annual Hunky Jesus contest. One 2020 study, conducted by the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies, found that 35 percent of San Franciscans were religious adherents, compared with nearly 49 percent nationally.
Mr. Young said he was heartened that people of all religious stripes, as well as those who are agnostic and atheist, were joining the fun at the cathedral.
"We always say you can belong before you believe, or you can belong and never believe," he said. "There's such a spiritual hunger. We're always going to look up at the stars in wonder. And we're always going to ask why we're here."
Of course, the unusual offerings were designed out of self-interest, too.
Grace is just one of many churches around the country that has tried to pay the bills in an era in which fewer people are going to church and tithing every Sunday.
Maintaining the cavernous structure and paying for staff and utilities cost a staggering $ 17,000 a day. The cathedral relies mostly on large private donations, but its Grace Arts membership fees, as well as charges for one-off classes, tours and concerts help, too. Praying and meditating at the church remain free.
Some churches have had after-lives as cafes, nightclubs or fraternity houses. Housing proponents see an opportunity for congregations with a surplus of land, such as expansive parking lots, to build affordable units alongside their churches, using the slogan YIGBY, "Yes in God's Backyard."
Mark Elsdon, a consultant who works with churches on transitioning their properties to other uses and is also an ordained minister, said more and more churches will face these conundrums.
"It's a wave, a tsunami, and we're actually just on the beginning of it," he said. "There just isn't the need for all that space."
Mr. Young said he hears from the deans of cathedrals in Washington, D.C., New York City and elsewhere who want ideas on how to draw more people to their buildings, if not to their church services.
"We definitely consult with each other," he said. "But we are the ones who are pushing the envelope more than they are."
Or unfurling the yoga mat as the case may be.
On a recent Tuesday evening, Paul Wong performed his weekly routine: arriving early to claim a prized yoga spot on the labyrinth at the center of the cathedral, and stripping off his work clothes to reveal shorts and a T-shirt.
He is a religious agnostic but said he feels at home at Grace.
"It does feel like going to church a little bit, but it's not pushed on you," he said. "Whatever worries or stresses I have, it helps me release them."
He lay down on his back and gazed up at the waning sunlight streaming through the stained glass windows. He took a deep breath. He was at peace.

Study Aims to Learn Why Ultraprocessed Foods Are So Irresistible: [National Desk]

Full text: It was 9 a.m. on a Friday in March, and Ernest Jones III was hungry.
From a hospital bed at a research facility at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, he surveyed his meal tray: Honey Nut Cheerios with fiber-enriched whole milk, a plastic-wrapped blueberry muffin and margarine.
"Simple, old school," one of those "Saturday morning breakfasts from back in the day," said Mr. Jones, 38, who is studying to become a pastor.
He was about halfway through his 28-day stay at the N.I.H., and Mr. Jones was one of 36 people participating in a nutrition trial that is expected to be completed in late 2025. For one month each, researchers will draw participants' blood, track their body fat and weight, measure the calories they burn, and feed them three meticulously designed meals per day.
The subjects don't know it, but their job is to help answer some of the most pressing questions in nutrition: Are ultraprocessed foods harmful to health? Are they a major driver of weight gain and obesity? And why is it so easy to eat so many of them?
If researchers can answer these questions, they say, perhaps there are ways to make ultraprocessed foods healthier.
The Trouble With Processing
Ultraprocessed foods encompass a large range of foods and drinks that are made using methods and ingredients you wouldn't typically use or find in a home kitchen. Sodas, processed meats and flavored yogurts are part of this category, as are most breakfast cereals, packaged breads and plant milks.
Ultraprocessed foods are a major source of calories in the United States -- making up about 58 percent of those consumed by children and adults, according to one recent estimate.
Kevin Hall, a senior investigator at the N.I.H. who is leading the trial, said that there is a "mountain of epidemiological data" linking ultraprocessed foods to poor health -- including 32 health concerns like heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, depression and certain gastrointestinal conditions and types of cancer.
But many questions remain, including whether it is the ultraprocessed foods themselves that cause those conditions, or whether it is something about the lives of the people who eat them. Scientists also still don't know why ultraprocessed foods might cause poor health.
There's a "gaping hole in our knowledge," Dr. Hall said -- one he hopes to begin to fill with this research.
The 'Most Important Study Done in Nutrition in Years'
In 2019, Dr. Hall and his colleagues published the results of a trial that has been hailed as one of the most influential studies in nutrition.
In it, 20 adults lived at the N.I.H. and spent two weeks following a diet made of ultraprocessed foods and two weeks following one prepared from unprocessed foods. Both diets had similar nutrient levels, and the participants were instructed to eat as much or as little as they liked.
The results were surprising: During the ultraprocessed weeks, the participants consumed about 500 more calories per day than they did during the unprocessed weeks, and gained an average of two pounds. By the end of the unprocessed weeks, they had lost about two pounds.
It was "the most important study done in nutrition in years," said Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University.
Researchers hadn't directly tested how ultraprocessed foods might influence calorie consumption and weight gain before, she said, and the answer was relevant to a large portion of Americans. It also rigorously controlled the participants' diets for a month -- something most nutrition studies don't do.
But the trial was small and hadn't been replicated, Dr. Hall said. It also didn't explain why people tend to overeat ultraprocessed foods.
So Dr. Hall is using this new study to replicate those findings, and to test two theories about why the foods may lead to weight gain.
One idea is that they often contain certain combinations of enticing nutrients -- like fats, sugars, sodium and carbohydrates -- that might trigger the brain's reward system in a way that makes people want to eat a lot of them.
After munching on salty potato chips, "your brain is like, 'Oh my god, we need another bite of that,"' even if "your stomach is like, 'Oh, please don't do that, we're so full,"' said Tera Fazzino, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Kansas. Dr. Fazzino defined the term used to describe this phenomenon, called hyperpalatability.
A second hypothesis, Dr. Hall said, is that ultraprocessed foods often contain many calories per bite. And because they can be less filling than unprocessed foods, you might consume more of them without thinking in order to feel satisfied.
Dr. Hall thinks that if food companies could make ultraprocessed foods less calorie-packed and irresistible, we might be less likely to consume extra calories and gain weight.
Tracked, Scanned and Chaperoned
Every day at 6:30 a.m., a nurse knocked on the door of Mr. Jones's room to wake him, check his blood pressure and take his weight.
At 9 a.m., it was time for his first meal. Every tray was carefully prepared in a basement kitchen at the N.I.H., each ingredient weighed to the nearest tenth of a gram. Participants were instructed to eat as much or as little as they liked. Some meals contained as many as 2,000 calories -- the amount some people have in an entire day.
Once he was finished, Mr. Jones's tray was whisked back to the basement, where scientists weighed any leftovers to calculate exactly how much he had eaten.
Mr. Jones didn't know about the food scales in the basement, or that the number of calories he consumed was the key part of the study. He also wasn't allowed to see his weight, over fears it might influence how much he ate.
Every week, the characteristics of the meals would change, depending on what the researchers were testing. One week was all unprocessed foods, like unsweetened yogurts, nuts, baked cod, stir-fried beef, rice and lots of vegetables.
For the other three weeks, at least 80 percent of the meals' calories were made up of ultraprocessed foods -- breakfast cereals, sausages, deli meats, sweetened yogurts, baked goods -- with slight tweaks between weeks to test how their calorie concentrations and palatability might affect how much the participants ate.
For the entire study, Mr. Jones wore a continuous glucose monitor on his upper arm to track blood sugar fluctuations. He also wore activity trackers on one of his wrists, an ankle and his waist to account for any variations in his activity. One day per week, his blood was drawn before breakfast and then six times more over the next three hours to measure his insulin, glucose, lipid and hunger and satiety hormone levels, as well as his inflammation markers.
Several times per day, an iPad would ping with survey questions about his mood, appetite and satisfaction with the meals.
Once a week, Mr. Jones would also get a full body scan to measure his body fat and a test to see how many calories he burned while resting in bed. And he'd be sealed into a dormlike room called a metabolic chamber for a 24-hour period every week, where researchers would measure how many calories he burned while eating, watching TV, riding a stationary bike, sleeping and doing other activities.
To see how the diets affected his gut microbiome, Mr. Jones also had to give a stool sample once a week -- his least favorite part of the study.
"That was the one thing that I was like, 'I don't know if I want to do this,"' Mr. Jones said.
In his downtime, he watched a lot of documentaries and sports -- including all of the March Madness games -- and he read, wrote in his journal, and attended divinity courses and church services online.
Living at the N.I.H. took some getting used to. Mr. Jones was the only trial participant at the N.I.H. during his stay; the researchers don't have space or staffing to accommodate more than one or two subjects at a time. And he was not allowed to snack or have caffeine, which can affect metabolism, Dr. Hall said, and people's preferences for coffee creamer and sweeteners would complicate things. Alcohol was also forbidden.
Mr. Jones missed sipping hot tea and eating homemade popcorn when he did his homework in the evenings, and he would have liked an occasional Jolly Rancher or honey bun. He sometimes craved a soda, which, despite being a major ultraprocessed product in the United States, was not part of the study.
He also missed his daily walks, which often stretched for more than 10 miles in his mother's Richmond, Va., neighborhood, where he'd lived for the year before coming to the N.I.H.
During the trial, Mr. Jones agreed to ride a stationary bicycle for an hour each day so he could get a standard amount of exercise. He was allowed to step outside or take short walks around campus, but they had to be chaperoned -- to prevent "stopping by the vending machine or the cafeteria," Dr. Hall said.
Mr. Jones asked to go outside only a handful of times during his month at the facility, but he was thrilled when a nurse handed him a pair of eclipse glasses on April 8 and told him it was time to go watch the celestial event.
What A Trial Like This Might Tell Us
If the study can give researchers some clarity about why ultraprocessed foods may cause unintentional weight gain, the results could help to guide nutrition policies, said Josiemer Mattei, an associate professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. For instance, she said, policymakers could develop labels for certain foods to warn about their potential health risks.
The ultraprocessed category includes so many foods and drinks that it's impractical -- and maybe not necessary -- for most people to avoid them all, Dr. Hall said.
But if the trial suggests that some of these foods cause weight gain because they are packed with calories or engineered to be extremely tasty, those findings can help distinguish which of the foods may be OK to eat, and which are most important to avoid, Dr. Hall said. Food manufacturers could potentially use that information to make processed foods that are less likely to cause weight gain, he said, such as by reducing their sodium or sugar, or by adding fiber, which adds bulk without adding calories.
Carlos Monteiro, a nutritional epidemiologist at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, who defined the term ultraprocessed foods with his colleagues in 2009, is skeptical that the companies would willingly implement these changes, though. Making a product less irresistible, for example, could cut into their profits, he said.
Still, Dr. Hall thinks it's worth a try to push for less harmful ultraprocessed foods, in part because it's unlikely that Americans will have the desire or time to go back to making everything from scratch, he said.
Dr. Hall's family eats plenty of unprocessed foods, but chicken nuggets and frozen pizzas still make occasional appearances in his home. They're convenient and his young children enjoy them. "I don't want to not have chicken nuggets as an option," he said.
He acknowledged that it'll take more research to understand how these foods affect health before they can be re-engineered so that they don't cause weight gain.
"It sounds pie in the sky," he said. But, he added, "I think there's a real shot at this."

Jones missed sipping hot tea and eating homemade popcorn when he did his homework in the evenings, and he would have liked an occasional Jolly Rancher or honey bun. He sometimes craved a soda, which, despite being a major ultraprocessed product in the United States, was not part of the study.
He also missed his daily walks, which often stretched for more than 10 miles in his mother’s Richmond, Virginia, neighborhood, where he’d lived for the year before coming to the NIH.
During the trial, Jones agreed to ride a stationary bicycle for an hour each day so he could get a standard amount of exercise. He was allowed to step outside or take short walks around campus, but they had to be chaperoned — to prevent “stopping by the vending machine or the cafeteria,” Hall said.
Jones asked to go outside only a handful of times during his month at the facility, but he was thrilled when a nurse handed him a pair of eclipse glasses April 8 and told him it was time to go watch the celestial event.
What A Trial Like This Might Tell Us
If the study can give researchers some clarity about why ultraprocessed foods may cause unintentional weight gain, the results could help to guide nutrition policies, said Josiemer Mattei, an associate professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. For instance, she said, policymakers could develop labels for certain foods to warn about their potential health risks.
The ultraprocessed category includes so many foods and drinks that it’s impractical — and maybe not necessary — for most people to avoid them all, Hall said.
But if the trial suggests that some of these foods cause weight gain because they are packed with calories or engineered to be extremely tasty, those findings can help distinguish which of the foods may be OK to eat and which are most important to avoid, Hall said. Food manufacturers could potentially use that information to make processed foods that are less likely to cause weight gain, he said, such as by reducing their sodium or sugar, or by adding fiber, which adds bulk without adding calories.
Carlos Monteiro, a nutritional public health researcher at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, who defined the term ultraprocessed foods with his colleagues in 2009, is skeptical that the companies would willingly implement these changes, though. Making a product less irresistible, for example, could cut into their profits, he said.
Still, Hall thinks it’s worth a try to push for less harmful ultraprocessed foods, in part because it’s unlikely that Americans will have the desire or time to go back to making everything from scratch, he said.
Hall’s family eats plenty of unprocessed foods, but chicken nuggets and frozen pizzas still make occasional appearances in his home. They’re convenient, and his young children enjoy them. “I don’t want to not have chicken nuggets as an option,” he said.
He acknowledged that it’ll take more research to understand how these foods affect health before they can be reengineered so that they don’t cause weight gain.
“It sounds pie in the sky,” he said. But, he added, “I think there’s a real shot at this.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Health concerns have been mounting for decades. Here's what the research suggests.
When artificial sweeteners entered the U.S. market in the 1950s, food manufacturers made a big claim: That they could satisfy the American sweet tooth without the negative health effects -- and calories -- of sugar.
Today, artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes have become ubiquitous in the food supply, showing up in a slew of products including diet sodas, sliced bread and low-sugar yogurts -- not to mention your morning coffee.
But questions about sugar substitutes have been swirling for decades, with scientists and public health officials suggesting they might come with certain health risks of their own.
The research on how sugar substitutes affect our bodies is preliminary, complex and sometimes contradictory.
"They haven't been studied as much as they should be in humans," said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University.
That leaves us with many questions about how to weigh their potential benefits and risks. Here's what we know.
What is a sugar substitute?
The term includes a range of substances that taste sweet but lack the calories found in sugar. They are sometimes hundreds to tens of thousands of times sweeter than sugar, so a little goes a long way.
They're used to sweeten many "sugar-free" and "diet" foods and drinks, including energy drinks, chewing gum, candies, baked goods and frozen desserts. Many are also sold as stand-alone products, in powder or liquid form.
Sugar substitutes are grouped according to how they're made:
Artificial sweeteners are synthetic food additives that are 200 to 20,000 times sweeter than table sugar, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Since the 1970s, the agency has approved six of them: aspartame (sold under the brand names NutraSweet and Equal), sucralose (Splenda), saccharin (Sweet'N Low), acesulfame potassium (Sweet One, Sunett), neotame (Newtame) and advantame.
Plant- and fruit-based sweeteners are made from the leaves or fruits of certain plants and are at least 100 times sweeter than sugar, according to the F.D.A. They include extracts from the stevia plant (Truvia, Pure Via, Enliten) and from monk fruit. Thaumatin, a less common low-calorie sweetener sold under the brand name Talin, is made from the West African katemfe fruit. The F.D.A. generally recognizes these sweeteners as safe, so manufacturers can add them to foods and drinks.
Sugar alcohols, which are neither sugars nor alcohols, are a type of carbohydrate that tastes sweet but has fewer calories (and carbohydrates) than sugar. They have names like sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol and erythritol and are naturally found in certain fruits and vegetables like pineapples, prunes and mushrooms. The kind used in packaged products are synthetically produced and permitted by the F.D.A. for use as sugar substitutes.
What are the potential benefits and risks?
There is some evidence that if you regularly drink sugar-sweetened beverages like sodas and sweet teas, switching to diet versions may help you lose a little weight -- as long as you don't consume more calories from other sources, said Maya Vadiveloo, an associate professor of nutrition at the University of Rhode Island.
In one 2022 review of 12 randomized clinical trials, most lasting six months or less, researchers concluded that substituting sugar-sweetened beverages with low- or no-calorie sweetened beverages could lead to some weight loss -- about two to three pounds, on average -- in adults who are overweight or obese and who have (or are at risk for) diabetes.
Dr. Karl Nadolsky, an endocrinologist and assistant clinical professor at the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, said he's seen that amount of weight loss, and often more, in many of his patients when they switch to diet beverages.
But longer-term studies on sugar substitutes have found no weight loss benefits, and even some harms. For this reason, the World Health Organization recommended in 2023 that people avoid using sugar substitutes for weight control or better health, citing research that linked them to greater risks of health concerns like Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity and earlier death.
The sugar alcohols erythritol and xylitol have also been associated with a greater risk of heart attack and stroke.
It's hard to draw firm conclusions from studies on diet and health. This type of research is observational, meaning it can link the consumption of sugar substitutes with certain health effects, but it can't prove cause and effect, said Valisa E. Hedrick, an associate professor of nutrition at Virginia Tech. It's possible that diet soda drinkers are simply less healthy to begin with, she explained. Or perhaps other ingredients in the foods or drinks are responsible for causing harm.
Many scientists have tried to account for these limitations and still found consistent links between the sweeteners and health issues, said Dr. Jim Krieger, a professor emeritus at the University of Washington School of Public Health.
But to completely resolve these issues of cause and effect, scientists would need to design studies that directly measure how sugar substitutes affect human health in the long term, said Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. And that research is practically impossible to do. "You can't lock people up long enough to feed them one or another artificial sweetener and see what happens," she said.
Still, some (but not all) well-controlled animal studies and small human experiments, which can show cause and effect, have shown hints of how certain sweeteners might lead to health problems, Dr. Krieger said. Some research has found that sugar alcohols can increase the risk of blood clotting, and therefore the risk of heart attack and stroke, and that other sugar substitutes can change the gut microbiome and impair blood sugar control.
The takeaway
Enough research has raised concerns about sugar substitutes to warrant a closer look, said Dr. Eran Elinav, an immunologist and microbiome researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel who has studied them. In the meantime, "the jury is still out" on whether they're harmful, he said, or if certain sugar substitutes are safer than others.
Too much sugar, on the other hand, is unquestionably harmful to health, Dr. Elinav said, with research linking it to greater risks of Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and obesity. The American Heart Association recommends that women consume no more than 25 grams of sugar per day, and men no more than 36 grams per day. A 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola contains 39 grams of sugar.
Given those known harms, it's better to choose artificially sweetened beverages like diet sodas over regular ones if you drink them every day, Dr. Mozaffarian said. But, he added, the goal is to minimize your consumption of both over the long term.
Dr. Vadiveloo agreed, suggesting ways to gradually reduce both added sugars and sugar substitutes in your diet.
To cut back on regular or diet soda, you might try seltzer sweetened with a small amount of fruit juice, she suggested; or instead of buying sweetened yogurt, try topping plain yogurt with fruit and a little honey.
Years ago, Dr. Vadiveloo took her coffee with Splenda, but she slowly reduced the amount she used. "Now I just take my coffee with milk, and I don't miss the sweetness," she said.

Full text: His innovative version of the chocolate chip cookie, studded with irregular pieces of dark Swiss chocolate, led to a chain of more than 100 stores worldwide.
David Liederman, whose confections redefined the chocolate chip cookie and whose chain, David's Cookies, grew to more than 100 stores nationwide, died on Thursday in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 75.
His wife, Susan Liederman, said the cause of his death, at a hospital, was a heart attack. He was also being treated for myelofibrosis, a type of blood cancer. He lived in nearby Katonah, N.Y.
Mr. Liederman's innovative version of the chocolate chip cookie will keep his name alive.
The cookie's unique feature was that it was not made with standard Toll House chocolate chips but was studded with irregular pieces of dark Swiss Lindt chocolate. He chopped the chocolate by hand, the way Ruth Graves Wakefield did when she created the Toll House cookie in 1938 in Whitman, Mass., before Nestlé took over the brand and began manufacturing its chocolate drops.
Mr. Liederman called his cookies chocolate chunk, a term that has become widely understood and used in the world of baking and confections.
But long before his revisionist cookie came on the scene, creating his reputation and cranking up his income, his career in food as a chef was starting to simmer like a good pot-au-feu.
He was 19, still an undergraduate, when he went to France. Intrigued by Michelin three-star restaurants -- there were only a handful at the time -- he decided to eat at Troisgros in Roanne, near Lyon, because it seemed to be the cheapest. The meal set him back $ 19 (the equivalent of about $ 172 today), but the food was an epiphany.
Mr. Liederman persuaded the Troisgros brothers to let him hang out in the kitchen and work for the next few summers despite his lack of culinary training. While he was studying for a degree at Brooklyn Law School and clerking for Judge Maxine Duberstein of the New York State Supreme Court, he began taking classes at night in the culinary program at New York Technical College (now the New York City College of Technology) in Downtown Brooklyn.
After graduating from law school and passing the bar, he worked for a time at a law firm. But after a few months he took off for France for a full-time job at Troisgros, where he eventually became a line cook. He was the first American employed in that kitchen; it would be decades before chefs of every nationality began working in top kitchens in France and elsewhere.
Mr. Liederman's talent for innovation and for meeting challenges head-on was showing its colors. "He was always trying to do something that no one else thought of," his younger brother, William, said in an interview.
Mr. Liederman then used his French culinary expertise to start manufacturing Saucier, a high-quality sauce base meant to be a superior replacement for bouillon cubes. His business partner was the book publisher Herbert Nagourney.
"They were two dear, enterprising if quixotic fellows easily seduced by entrepreneurial ideas," Mr. Nagourney's wife, Ann Bramson, said in an email. "Neither had a fondness for authority figures."
While on a publicity tour for Saucier, Mr. Liederman went to a chocolate chip cookie store in San Francisco. He did not like the cookies and decided he could do better. He also figured that cookies might do better than French sauces.
He opened his first cookie store, David's Cookie Kitchen, on Second Avenue and 53rd Street in Manhattan in 1979. Shops around the country had begun selling chocolate chip cookies and finally started popping up in New York. His cookies were clearly the best, in large measure because they were made with high-quality ingredients, including good butter, fresh nuts and that chocolate. A little-known sideline of his enterprise was bread, namely fresh baguettes made from scratch.
A chain of more than 100 David's Cookies stores followed, nationwide and in Japan, along with several restaurants. Other entrepreneurial efforts included an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to buy Zabar's, the Upper West Side food emporium, and turn it into a national chain.
Mr. Liederman sold David's Cookies to Fairfield Foods in New Jersey in 1995 and retired from the company, which is still thriving, though he often said the quality of the cookies no longer met his standards. At his death he was tinkering with the notion of going back into the cookie business.
David Liederman was born on March 15, 1949, in Manhattan. His parents, Donald Liederman, who had an investment company, and Adele Kaplan, who became the head of the Small Business Development Center at Rutgers University, divorced when he was 3 and his brother was a year old.
David was raised in Princeton, N.J.. His stepfather, Arthur Adlerstein, was a professor of psychology at Princeton University, and David graduated from the Hun School there. He attended Denison University in Granville, Ohio; graduated from the State University of New York at Old Westbury, on Long Island; and then went to law school. Having a law degree became a useful string in his entrepreneurial bow.
Mr. Liederman valued his cookie business at about $ 35 million in the mid-1980s (about $ 102 million in today's currency), but his passion was restaurants. Soon after leasing the location for his first cookie store, he opened Manhattan Market in the same space with Susan Vare, an actress, who became his wife.
"Cooking the Nouvelle Cuisine in America," the 1979 book he wrote with Michele Urvater, who owned a cooking school in Manhattan, connected Mr. Liederman to the latest food trends coming from France, where cutting-edge chefs were turning their backs on Georges Auguste Escoffier's fat and flour and opting for a fresh, lighter approach.
But nouvelle cuisine with small decorative portions on big white plates was not what Manhattan Market was serving; rather, with its emphasis on fresh, top-drawer ingredients, it was a forerunner of the farm-to-table movement.
A number of well-known chefs worked there, including Michael Romano and Matthew Tivy. Mr. Liederman was as generous a mentor as he was a host, all of which worked to his advantage.
"As a chef and a cook it was more important to him to have flavor, texture and quality products; he was not a showman," said Eberhard Muller, a chef who worked at Lutèce, where the Liedermans dined frequently, and who is now a partner in Satur Farms, a fresh produce company on Long Island.
The actor and writer Michael Tucker also bonded with Mr. Liederman over cooking. He "was smart," Mr. Tucker said in an interview, "he knew how to cultivate people of influence, and he was also incredibly generous."
He was also willing to learn from other chefs. On another trip to France he dined at the venerable and purposely shabby bistro Chez L'Ami Louis in Paris and was so impressed with the roast chicken that he befriended the owner and chef, Antoine Magnin.
The encounter led him to replace Manhattan Market in 1985 with Chez Louis, a Second Avenue establishment, near 54th Street, whose specialty was a memorably delicious roast chicken and a few other items, like a garlic potato cake, based on L'Ami Louis's menu. Bryan Miller gave Chez Louis two stars in The New York Times in 1987.
Another of his restaurants was Broadway Grill, near Times Square. And with his brother, who owned the New York Restaurant School, Mr. Liederman opened a Rockefeller Center restaurant, Television City. "I credit him with getting me into this business," William Liederman said.
In 1994, after moving to northern Westchester County, David Liederman opened Restaurant Luna in Mount Kisco. It is no longer in business. (He also served on the board of Citymeals on Wheels.)
Mr. Liederman's love for food showed in his girth, which he knew was a problem -- he even wrote a book in 1990 called "David's Delicious Weight-Loss Program." He said his doctor had advised him to lose weight "or you'll never live to see grandchildren." So, despite being a connoisseur of French wine, he gave up drinking. But he continued to sniff glasses of wine, prizing their qualities from bouquet alone, as experts can. And he did live to see two grandchildren.
In addition to his wife, his brother and those two grandchildren, he is survived by his daughters, Katie Liederman, a psychotherapist, and Elizabeth Liederman Rossi, who worked in marketing for the Yankees; and a half sister, Ann Liederman.

Liederman’s love for food showed in his girth, which he knew was a problem — he even wrote a book in 1990 called “David’s Delicious Weight-Loss Program.” He said his doctor had advised him to lose weight “or you’ll never live to see grandchildren.” So, despite being a connoisseur of French wine, he gave up drinking. But he continued to sniff glasses of wine, prizing their qualities from bouquet alone, as experts can. And he did live to see two grandchildren.
In addition to his wife, his brother and those two grandchildren, he is survived by his daughters, Katie Liederman, a psychotherapist, and Elizabeth Liederman Rossi, who worked in marketing for the New York Yankees; and a half sister, Ann Liederman.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: She painted and sculpted, but she was best known for her oversized still lifes, painted from photographs and crowded with color and detail.
Audrey Flack, a pioneer of photorealism who became known for oversize, in-your-face still lifes crowded with color and detail, died on Friday in Southampton, N.Y. She was 93.
Her daughter Hannah Marcus said her death, in a hospital, was caused by an aortic tear.
Ms. Flack's best-known paintings were still lifes painted from photographs, sometimes with an airbrush. In "Queen," a dewy rose, an orange section, a playing card and a photo locket with pictures of Ms. Flack and her mother nestle among other symbolic and sentimental objects on a canvas six and a half feet square. "Macarena of Miracles," which was shown at the 1972 Whitney Biennial, is a precise close-up study of a wooden madonna sculpture in the cathedral of Seville attributed to the 17th-century sculptor Luisa Roldán, with special attention to her elaborately gilded robes and crystal tears. In "World War II (Vanitas)," Ms. Flack depicts a red candle, a string of pearls and a small silver tray of oversize petits fours sitting on a photograph of concentration camp inmates.
Before those still lifes, which mostly date to the 1970s, she made simpler, more deadpan photo-based work like "The Kennedy Motorcade," in which an ordinary press image becomes ominous and otherworldly, or "Farb Family Portrait," whose syrupy shadows add an eerie eccentricity to the image of an Upper West Side family at home.
Works like these were so straightforward and literal that they seemed to invite misunderstanding. The fact that Ms. Flack was often the only woman in a cohort of male painters didn't help.
A painting like "Banana Split Sundae" could easily be taken for a critique of American excess, or a joke, while her appropriation of Baroque Catholic aesthetics in the Macarena paintings was read as satirical, even though she had traveled to Spain to photograph the sculpture after being introduced to the piece by a picture postcard from the curator Marcia Tucker.
Ms. Flack always insisted that she was motivated by nothing more than a pure, almost abstract interest in light and color -- the same interest that peers like Robert Bechtle or Chuck Close channeled into matte automobiles and expressionless faces -- and by a desire to make her work accessible to as many viewers as possible.
She did paint "Chanel," a study of lipsticks and perfume bottles, as, in her words, an "intentionally feminist painting" in 1974, and sexual politics became more explicit in her work later on. But if her subject matter initially seemed feminine, or feminist -- and it did -- it wasn't because she had made a programmatic choice to make it so. It was simply because, however fierce her ambition, she was determined to follow her interests and honor her own life.
Audrey Lenora Flack was born on May 30, 1931, in Manhattan, the younger of two children of Morris Flack, who owned a garment factory, and Jeanette (Flichtenfeld) Flack. Her parents were both immigrants from Poland.
In a memoir, "With Darkness Came Stars," published this year, she described her mother as a high-stakes poker addict who often disappeared for days at a time. But she also crocheted, embroidered, cut old master reproductions out of magazines and hung Alberto Vargas pinups in the bathroom.
Ms. Flack graduated from the High School of Music & Art (now the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts) and won admission to the Cooper Union. From there she transferred to Yale, where she earned her B.F.A. in 1952, after being recruited by the artist and educator Josef Albers. She later studied anatomy with Robert Beverly Hale at the Art Students League.
While at the Cooper Union, Ms. Flack began visiting the Cedar Tavern, a well-known artists' hangout in Greenwich Village, and met older painters like Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. For a while she was a member of their crowd, producing powerful nonfigurative paintings -- even as she fended off unwanted advances. (According to her memoir, Mr. Albers made such advances, too.)
"I have asked myself why I didn't sleep with Jackson Pollock, Bill de Kooning, Franz Kline, Mike Goldberg, Mort Feldman or Clement Greenberg," she wrote. "Power, fame, entree into intellectual circles, exhibitions and reviews all came with these men, yet I couldn't do it. I wasn't attracted to testosterone-fueled aggression and out-of-control drinking."
In any case, she loved figuration: Under Mr. Albers's gaze at Yale, she splattered paint on canvas from 10 feet away, but alone in her room she copied old masters. In 1956, she was included in a large Abstract Expressionist group show at Stable Gallery in Manhattan, and her piece, "Lady With a Pink," was hung between works by Lee Krasner and Milton Avery -- but when people noticed its figurative elements, it was moved to a dark corner on the second floor.
Ms. Flack's first marriage, to the cellist Frank Levy, ended in divorce. Their older daughter, Melissa, was eventually diagnosed with severe autism and placed in a residential school, but not before Ms. Flack's worries about her, as she struggled to care for her, were brushed off by her husband and several pediatricians.
When she married Bob Marcus, a former high school sweetheart, in 1970, he adopted her daughters.
In addition to her daughter Hannah, she is survived by her other daughter, Melissa Marcus; her stepdaughter, Leslie Marcus; her stepson, Mitchell Marcus; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Mr. Marcus, a commodities trader, died in May. Another stepdaughter, Aileen Marcus, died in 2022.
In the early 1960s, Ms. Flack began painting from photographs, including snapshots of her daughters as well as press photos of John F. Kennedy and of people mourning his assassination. She went on to paint directly over projections, starting with the "Farb Family Portrait" commission from Oriole Farb, the director of the Riverside Museum, which paid for Melissa's first residential treatment. She also bought a square-format Hasselblad camera, turned her bathroom into a darkroom and learned to paint with an airbrush.
In the early 1980s, Ms. Flack switched to sculpture, working in bronze with more unambiguously feminist subjects, as in "Egyptian Rocket Goddess"; after three decades she returned to painting, making intricate, cartoonlike scenes she described as "Post Pop Baroque" that she showed with the Hollis Taggart gallery. She had previously been represented by Louis K. Meisel, starting with his gallery's first show, in 1973.
Her "Leonardo's Lady" (1974) was the first photorealist painting acquired by the Museum of Modern Art, and her work has been collected by numerous other museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She and Mary Cassatt were the first two women to be included in the comprehensive textbook "Janson's History of Art."
She was also a dedicated musician. She fronted a band called the History of Art, for which she wrote art-related songs, and which performed at art museums, comedy clubs and the Cooper Union.
Ms. Flack's dogged commitment to painting in the face of setbacks and sexism was matched by her commitment to her family -- but she always knew she had to keep the two separate.
"I kept my children and Melissa's autism secret from the art world," she wrote in her memoir. "I also never spoke of my husband's total rejection of his own child and his increasingly abusive behavior. I never let them see the pain or the struggle I was dealing with.
"Having children was bad enough, but I thought that having a special-needs child would surely define me as nothing but a mother, a failure, a weak person, and that my work would be dismissed as 'ladies' art.' I couldn't let that happen. Art was my life long before I had children, and it would remain so forever."

Simple Tips to Grilling Better Dogs: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Millions of Americans will be eating hot dogs this week. Here's a streamlined method with a final easy tweak to ensure yours sizzles and snaps.
Freeze a hot dog until it's solid. That's the first step to cooking one, according to a video published last month and now viewed tens of millions of times. The icy cold hot dog is then shaved with a vegetable peeler and air-fried into bouncy curls.
In other videos, hot dogs have undergone more extreme treatments: sliced into ringlets and pine cones or slashed with cross hatches and fish scales. Though these preparations promise browned bits and quicker cook times, not all glow-ups are worth the effort.
Recipe: Grilled Hot Dogs
In tests with various brands of hot dogs (including beef, pork, poultry and plant-based) on charcoal and gas grills, and a campfire, on their own and in buns with toppings, the soundest method for consistently snappy sizzled hot dogs was also the most straightforward. Vegetable peeler and TikTok tutorials not required.
The set up is minimal: a flame, a grate and tongs. Same with the method. Here are the three tips to keep in mind.
Build a fire that's not too hot.
In testing, moderate heat most consistently yielded crisp outsides and hot insides. Gradually warming the hot dog minimizes the risk of bursting and allows more time over the fire to pick up smoky flavor. To get that not-too-hot temperature, wait for a charcoal fire to move past blazing to smoldering coals that are coated in ash, or set your gas grill to 325 degrees to 375 degrees. You should be able to hold your hand four to five inches above the grates for six to seven seconds.
Skip extra prep and steps.
Halving a hot dog lengthwise so it lays flat on the grill like an open book makes it very crispy and creates a convenient channel to hold toppings, but the meat curls easily and dries out. Carving patterns asks a lot of the chef, who ideally is more focused on sipping a cold drink than artfully sculpting hot dogs. And keeping them whole ensures their juiciness. During recipe tests, slicing resulted in the greatest loss of moisture and fat by weight: 20 percent compared with 10 percent from hot dogs cooked right from the package.
In short, the only prep you need to do is pat the hot dogs dry.
If you're using hot dogs with a natural casing, there is one additional step: Prick them all over with a fork before cooking to allow some of the steam to release -- and ensure that they don't burst when cooking. Or, if you have a saucepan handy, simmer them in water until warmed through, then char on the grill for a minute or two.
Arrange the hot dogs parallel to the grates.
Grill marks look neat, but a fully browned hot dog tastes more delicious. Instead of setting the dogs perpendicular to the grates, nestle them between the rods like the ones rotating in cases at a ballpark or convenience store. This setup exposes more of the meat to the flame, toasting the dogs more quickly and preventing them from rolling. (Make sure there's also at least an inch between the hot dogs so heat can circulate and turn them every minute for even browning.)
Hot dogs are hand-held happiness, best when not overthought. Just change the direction you set them on the grate and sizzle them over a moderate fire until they look, smell and taste good. Then it's just buns, toppings, smiles.

Making Something From Nothing Is an Art: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: A quick spin through the pantry can produce a dinner to remember.
In John Guare's play "Six Degrees of Separation," there's a scene in which a father asks a second-grade teacher, at parents' night, why the art her students make is so especially brilliant. "Look at the first grade," he says to her.
Blotches of green and black. Look at the third grade. Camouflage. But the second grade -- your grade. Matisses everyone. You've made my child a Matisse. Let me study with you. Let me into second grade! What is your secret? And this is what she said: "Secret? I don't have any secret. I just know when to take their drawings away from them."
I think of this scene -- the father is played by Donald Sutherland in Fred Schepisi's film version -- every time I make the sort of pasta dish that's known in our house as pasta nada. The key to a true pasta nada is deep restraint. The Zen-secret is knowing when to stop.
Pasta nada is better known to the world as pantry pasta. These are the pasta dishes you make, vastly better and less expensive than ordering out, from ingredients that are already in your kitchen.
There are dozens of books, thousands of articles and many industrious websites devoted to the making of pantry pastas. The more the merrier; I like nearly all of them. But once I heard the phrase pasta nada for the first time three decades ago -- from my father-in-law, the chef Bruce LeFavour, and his wife, the photographer Faith Echtermeyer, who used it to describe their own last-minute pasta dishes -- I've never called it anything else.
Names matter. Would you rather eat calf's thymus, or sweetbreads? Would "The Joy of Sex" be a cultural touchstone if it had been issued under its original title, "Alex Comfort's Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking"? A good name is the difference, as Mark Twain put it in a slightly different context, between the lightning bug and the lightning.
The word nada, from the Spanish and classical Latin, means "nothing." It's a word that implies renunciation, and it has a much better ring, in this context, than bupkis. If you don't count olive oil (we don't), the best pasta nadas employ two ingredients: Parmesan and fresh herbs. Olive oil, Parmesan and herbs are pasta's rhythm section, and on their own they make sublime pasta nada.
Recipe: Sage and Walnut Pasta Nada
Our longtime favorite, for its elegance, is sage and walnut. We tend to have a small baggie of sage in the fridge. If we don't, we pluck a few leaves from one of the sage plants my wife, Cree, tends. Toast the walnuts in the oven. Chop coarsely or crush. Chop the sage leaves, too. This meal is worthy of any bottle of red wine.
If you make this as an off-the-cuff dinner, in a rental house or when friends drop in, people will be jolted by your minimalist dexterity. These dishes are a return to first things. A good baguette and a salad will seal the deal.
Pasta nada passes the Calvin Trillin test. The rule of thumb when ordering pasta, Trillin wrote, is that the dish "is likely to be satisfying in inverse proportion to the number of ingredients that the menu lists as being in it."
Recipe: Puttanesca Pasta Nada
Our next-favorite pasta nadas are lo-fi variations on the theme of puttanesca. Instead of employing each of the classic ingredients -- anchovies, capers, black olives, garlic and tomatoes -- try just, let's say, black olives and anchovies.
This won't be for everyone. The novelist Beverly Lowry wrote that the fastest thing she ever saw was "Larry McMurtry pulling an anchovy out of his mouth." Or use just finely minced garlic and a few capers. Or good canned tuna and tomatoes. These flavors cry out to be tested in variations.
"The great restorative" -- that's what the writer and gastronome Jim Harrison called puttanesca. These pasta nada versions act similarly. Annia Ciezadlo, in her memoir "Days of Honey," which is in part about cooking in Baghdad and Beirut during wartime, writes that because of its name -- "in the style of the prostitute" -- pasta puttanesca has "a residual taste of sex." It's earthy, honest, a little bit greasy. This is true of the pared-down versions, too.
Pasta nadas are so simple that sometimes it is a treat to make two at once -- sage and walnut, and anchovies and black olives -- and nestle discrete piles of each on a dinner plate. This is an inexpensive way to feel like Mario Puzo, the author of "The Godfather," who when in his favorite restaurants was known to order every pasta on the menu, just so his friends could have a taste.

Are Prebiotic Sodas Good for Gut Health?: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Experts weigh in on just how likely Poppi drinks and others are to nourish your microbiome.
The sodas come in fun flavors like Cherry Vanilla and Orange Cream, and carry an alluring claim: They're good for your gut. That pitch has helped prebiotic soft drink brands like Poppi and Olipop stand out in the soda aisle.
The drinks contain prebiotics, or dietary fibers that can't be digested by humans, but can feed the beneficial microbes that live in our guts, said Hannah Holscher, an associate professor of nutrition at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. (Probiotic products, by comparison, contain live microbes themselves.)
But nutrition experts say you don't need a special soda to reap those benefits: Many foods, like garlic, onions, peas, beans, lentils, grains and some fruits, are naturally rich in prebiotic fibers.
"If you eat a high fiber diet, you're taking care of your prebiotics pretty well," said Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University.
Inulin, the main prebiotic fiber used in these sodas, can be isolated from plants, such as agave or chicory root, said Dr. Holscher, who has accepted travel and speaking fees from Beneo, a company that manufactures ingredients, including prebiotic fibers.
The amount of fiber in prebiotic beverages varies. A can of Orange Cream Poppi has two grams of dietary fiber; a Strawberry Vanilla Olipop has nine grams. U.S. dietary guidelines recommend 28 grams of fiber for a 2,000 calorie per day diet, but most Americans fall far short of this goal.
It's best to get your fiber from a variety of foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes, because they're also rich in vitamins, minerals and beneficial compounds called phytochemicals that can only be found in plants, Dr. Holscher said. A medium apple, a cup of cooked broccoli, and a cup of cooked steel cut oatmeal each contain five grams of fiber; a half cup of lentils and a cup of raspberries each contain eight grams.
These foods also provide multiple types of fibers -- not just one or two, as you might find in sodas or other products with supplemental fiber. "It's these complex mixtures of different fibers that support lots of different microbes" and general gut health, Dr. Holscher said.
But, Dr. Holscher added, foods or beverages with added fibers can help you meet your fiber goals. And some small studies have linked prebiotics, in both supplements and added to foods, with a healthier gut lining, improved insulin sensitivity and increased feelings of fullness. They also suggest that prebiotics may be able to provide some relief from constipation. That said, this evidence is mixed; other studies have not found benefits of prebiotics.
You typically need at least three grams of prebiotic fibers to begin to see any benefits, and at least 12 grams of inulin are generally needed to relieve constipation, Dr. Holscher said.
But there can be downsides to fiber, too, especially if you increase your consumption too suddenly. Inulin fiber, which is used in prebiotic sodas, can cause digestive discomfort, Dr. Holscher said. As little as one to five grams can cause mild flatulence, for instance, and larger doses may lead to bloating. Some people "can't even look at a food product that contains inulin without getting gas and bloating," Dr. Holscher said, while others may experience no symptoms.
People with irritable bowel syndrome can be particularly sensitive to these effects; inulin and other prebiotic fibers are considered FODMAPs, types of carbohydrates that can worsen I.B.S. symptoms in some people. While these drinks typically have significantly less added sugar than a traditional soda, they still contain sugar -- which might also exacerbate I.B.S. symptoms, said Dr. Sean Paul Spencer, a gastroenterologist and researcher at Stanford University.
The best way to nourish the microbiome, he said, is to eat whole foods and limit sugar, processed foods and emulsifiers, which may negatively affect it.
Poppi soda also contains apple cider vinegar, which some small studies suggest can help lower blood sugars when consumed before a meal. But whether there is enough vinegar in a can of Poppi to have that effect isn't clear, said Carol Johnston, a professor of nutrition at Arizona State University. The company did not respond to a question about the amount of apple cider vinegar in its beverages.
Olipop is marketed as containing "botanicals," with several plant extracts like calendula and nopal cactus listed among its ingredients. As to whether there are any benefits of these substances, Dr. Johnston said: "Who knows?" These ingredients haven't been well studied.
Prebiotic sodas aren't likely to harm your health, Dr. Nestle said, but it's also not likely that they'll be beneficial.
"Really, if people are concerned about their microbiome, they need to eat vegetables," Dr. Nestle said. "Vegetables would do wonders."

Civil War Pushes Ravaged Sudan Toward Abyss: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The gold market is a graveyard of rubble and dog-eaten corpses. The state TV station became a torture chamber. The national film archive was blown open in battle, its treasures now yellowing in the sun.
Artillery shells soar over the Nile, smashing into hospitals and houses. Residents bury their dead outside their front doors. Others march in formation, joining civilian militias. In a hushed famine ward, starving babies fight for life. Every few days, one of them dies.
Khartoum, the capital of Sudan and one of the largest cities in Africa, has been reduced to a charred battleground. A feud between two generals fighting for power has dragged the country into civil war and turned the city into ground zero for one of the world's worst humanitarian catastrophes.
As many as 150,000 people have died since the conflict erupted last year, by American estimates. Another nine million have been forced from their homes, making Sudan home to the largest displacement crisis on earth, the United Nations says. A famine looms that officials warn could kill hundreds of thousands of children in the coming months and, if unchecked, rival the great Ethiopian famine of the 1980s.
Fueling the chaos, Sudan has become a playground for foreign players like the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Russia and its Wagner mercenaries, and even a few Ukrainian special forces. They are all part of a volatile stew of outside interests pouring weapons or fighters into the conflict and hoping to grab the spoils of war -- Sudan's gold, for instance, or its perch on the Red Sea.
The greatest tragedy is that none of it was necessary, said Samawal Ahmed, as he picked his way through the remnants of a famous market, past looted jewelry stores and a mangled tank. A year ago, in the first weeks of the war, a rocket smashed into his apartment, and the medical lab where he worked closed down for good. Now he was back, to salvage what he could.
"I lost everything," he said, holding a batch of documents pulled from the wreckage of his home: his children's school certificates, his professional qualifications, and a passport. Across the street, the withered remains of three fighters, reduced to bones, were splayed among the debris.
"It makes my stomach churn," Mr. Ahmed said. "All this could have been avoided."
The war erupted without warning in April 2023, when a standoff between Sudan's military and a powerful paramilitary group it helped create -- the Rapid Support Forces -- burst into gunfire on the streets of Khartoum.
Few Sudanese expected it would last long. Since independence in 1956, their country has experienced more coups than any other in Africa, most short-lived and bloodless. The rivals this time -- the national army and the paramilitary force that once did its bidding -- had seized power together in 2021, but fell out over how to merge their armies.
Almost immediately, the fighting ripped across Khartoum and far beyond, in pulsing waves that quickly consumed Africa's third-largest country. Sudanese have been stunned by the destruction, but neither side looks capable of victory, and the war is metastasizing into a devastating free-for-all.
Another genocide now threatens Darfur, the region that became synonymous with war crimes two decades ago. Fields have become battlegrounds in the country's breadbasket. The health system is crumbling. And a plethora of armed groups, including hard-line Islamists, foreign mercenaries and even former pro-democracy protesters, has piled into the fight.
With American-led peace talks stalled, the Sudanese state is collapsing and threatening to drag down a fragile region with it. Experts say it is a matter of time before one of Sudan's many neighbors, like Chad, Eritrea or South Sudan, gets sucked in.
Though often overshadowed by the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, the conflict in Sudan has global ramifications. Iran, already allied with the Houthis in Yemen, is now backing military forces on both sides of the Red Sea. Europeans fear a wave of Sudanese migrants heading for their shores. A recent U.S. intelligence assessment warned that a lawless Sudan could become a haven for "terrorist and criminal networks."
As we approached the capital, artillery boomed, a warplane swept overhead and, across the Nile, an oily plume of smoke rose from Sudan's largest refinery -- the latest flashpoint in a sprawling urban battle. With the city in tumult, we slept in an abandoned house, where a neighbor told of how a bomb killed his sister in their kitchen.
It was just one corner of a country three times larger than France. Yet it was possible to see, up close, the immense damage to a capital once considered a jewel on the Nile -- and how, if unchecked, it could still get much worse.
The River
Gunfire and mortars splashed into the waters around Col. Osman Taha, a badly wounded officer in the Sudanese military, as he crossed the Nile on a moonless night last November. Around him, he recalled, other wounded soldiers huddled in the boat, hoping to avoid being hit again. Several died.
Colonel Taha made it to the far bank, and five days later his right leg was amputated. Even then, there was no respite. As he recovered in a military hospital overlooking the Nile, he said, shells slammed into its walls, fired by the Rapid Support Forces across the river. Patients moved their beds to avoid being hit as artillery fell.
The Nile has long defined Khartoum. Its tributaries merge in the city center before pushing north through the desert into Egypt. Now, the great river divides Khartoum militarily as well, yet another front line in a splintered capital.
Snipers nestle in the riverbank beneath a giant bridge, blown up in fighting, that slumps into the river. Drones swoop over the water, hunting for targets. And an island in the center of the Nile, where people once picnicked and swam, has become a kind of open-air prison controlled by the R.S.F., residents say.
"Watch your step," said Dr. Manahil Mohamed as she led us up a sandbag-lined staircase to the fourth floor of the Aliaa Specialist Hospital, overlooking the Nile, where a line of blown-out windows offered a stark panorama.
On the deserted street below, burned-out vehicles clustered around the Parliament building. In the distance stood the skeletal skyline of downtown Khartoum: government ministries, luxury hotels and mirrored high-rises that poked over the city's poverty, many built during Sudan's oil boom of the 1990s, now pocked by shelling or gutted by fire. Among them stood the old Republican Palace where followers of the Mahdi, a cleric, toppled and beheaded the country's British governor-general, Charles Gordon, in 1885. It, too, has gone up in smoke.
In many ways, the destruction in Khartoum is a bitter historical reckoning. For over half a century, Sudan's military waged ugly wars in the nation's distant peripheries, quelling rebellions by deploying ruthless militias. Khartoum was left untouched, its residents insulated from the consequences of wars fought in their name.
Now, the army's most powerful creation -- the Rapid Support Forces, a successor to the infamous Janjaweed militias that terrorized Darfur in the 2000s -- has turned against the military and brought its trademark havoc to the capital.
Half of Khartoum state's nine million residents have fled, the United Nations estimates. Its international airport is closed, bullet-pocked jets abandoned on the runway. Nearly all of the city's 1,060 bank branches have been robbed, officials say, and many thousands of cars stolen -- some later located as far away as Niger, 1,500 miles west -- in a campaign of street-by-street looting, most but not all, by the Rapid Support Forces.
"A city of this size, this wealth, and nothing remains?" Mohamed Eldaw, a banker, said. "It must be the biggest episode of looting in history."
At the Aliaa hospital, a triple thud of outgoing artillery shattered the calm. Warning of snipers, Dr. Mohamed urged us back inside.
For months, shells rained on the hospital, which mostly treated soldiers, often punching through its walls, she said. With no electricity, surgeons performed operations by the light of mobile phones.
Relief came in February when the military, armed with powerful new Iranian drones, recaptured this part of the city. (By contrast, the R.S.F. uses drones supplied by the United Arab Emirates).
The military's advance allowed hundreds of wounded troops to be evacuated by air to Port Sudan, where they lie in the crowded wards of a military hospital. One man had extensive facial injuries from a drone strike. Amputations were common.
The evacuees included Colonel Taha, who sat up in his bed to show a series of videos that he took during his last battle. Jubilant soldiers can be seen whooping and hugging, thinking they have won. Bleeding R.S.F. fighters lie in the dust, and are kicked or taunted by the soldiers. The camera flips to show Colonel Taha himself, sweating heavily, his eyes glazed from battle.
But the soldiers had missed one R.S.F. fighter, a sniper hidden in a residential block, and he shot Colonel Taha in the leg. Later that night, he said, medics moved him to an ammunition factory beside the Nile, where they embarked on their perilous crossing.
He was pessimistic the war would end anytime soon.
"Guns can't solve this problem," he said. "We need to talk peace."
The Famine Ward
To Amna Amin, war means hunger.
After Rapid Support Forces fighters swept into her part of Omdurman, one of the three cities that make up greater Khartoum, Ms. Amin, 36, had no way to feed her five children.
Her husband, a gold miner in the distant north, had vanished. She lost her job as a cleaner. Neighbors shared what they could, but it wasn't enough. And soon she had two more mouths to feed: Iman and Ayman, twins born in September.
Within months, the twins started losing weight and suffering diarrhea, classic signs of malnutrition. Panicking, Ms. Amin bundled her children in her arms and made a desperate dash across the front line, traveling by donkey cart and minibus to reach Al Buluk children's hospital, the last place they might be saved.
The United Nations has yet to officially declare a famine in Sudan, but few experts doubt that one is already underway in parts of Darfur and, shockingly, Khartoum, one of the largest capitals in Africa.
More than 220,000 children could die in the coming months alone, the U.N. says. And both sides use hunger as a weapon of war, aid officials say. The army withholds visas, travel permits and permission to cross the front lines. Rapid Support Force fighters have looted aid trucks and warehouses and raised their own obstacles.
"One of the most horrific situations on Earth is on a trajectory to get far, far worse," said Tom Perriello, the United States envoy for Sudan.
The hospitals still functioning are strained to the point of collapse. Every day hundreds of new patients arrive at Al Nau hospital, near the frontline in Omdurman. Many sleep two to a bed.
Patients spoke of pinballing from one neighborhood to another as the front line shifts, running a gauntlet of checkpoints defended by fighters who demand money, steal phones and sometimes open fire.
Huda Adil, 30, was paralyzed from the waist down after R.S.F. fighters shot up the bus she was traveling in. (Three passengers died, she said).
Amouna Elhadi sat over her son, Hassan, a 14-year-old shot in the stomach by the mustanfareen, as new youth groups fighting alongside Sudan's military have become known.
Mujahid Abdulaziz, however, was smiling.
For 10 weeks, he had been trying to get a bullet removed from his leg. An R.S.F. fighter shot him at a checkpoint after a drone strike on a nearby fuel station killed several other fighters. "The guy was angry," Mr. Abdulaziz said.
For Mr. Abdulaziz, a 20-year-old engineering student, it was just the start of a torturous search for help.
One hospital patched up his wound, but couldn't extract the bullet. A second hospital couldn't, either. He crossed the Nile three times, circling the capital in buses that passed through deserts and around a mountain. Finally, after a journey of 100 miles that should have been 10, he reached Al Nau hospital, where doctors pulled out the bullet, at last.
Not long ago, Mr. Abdulaziz believed he was part of an exciting future. He participated in the euphoric mass protests in 2019 that helped topple President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, Sudan's autocratic ruler of three decades, a moment of triumph for the country. Two years later, he returned to the streets, defiantly flinging stones at riot police officers following the military coup that set back hopes for civilian rule.
Some protesters now run soup kitchens that provide much of the limited aid available in Khartoum.
But Mr. Abdulaziz just felt defeated.
Before the war, "we were just dreaming," he said. "Those hopes are gone."
Clinging to Hope
Mudassir Ibrahim, 50, lifted his shirt to show welts across his back -- evidence, he said, of a week spent in R.S.F. detention inside the headquarters of Sudan's national radio and television station. His captors beat him with iron rods and electrical cables, he said: "It felt like death a thousand times over."
At the television station in Omdurman, we saw evidence to back his claims. Ropes and other restraints hung from barred rooms in the finance department. Piles of dry excrement were scattered on the floor. Filthy walls were scrawled with names, pleas and snatches of poetry.
"The treachery of your tears is no use to fight injustice," read one.
"Friends forever" read another, under a list of six names.
Most of the compound stood in ruins. Its main building had been incinerated by airstrikes, while a film archive dating back to the 1940s, one of the largest in Africa, had been blown open by gunfire. The R.S.F. had retreated across the river, soldiers said, but some left behind their own wartime wisdom.
"As long as death is certain," read a line scrawled on one wall, "don't live like a coward." (The R.S.F. did not respond to the allegations of torture and other abuses by its fighters).
As the fighting raged, some Omdurman residents refused to leave. "We were born here, we grew up here, and we will die here," said Edward Fahmy, 73, sitting in his courtyard of his modest home in the old city, where pictures of Jesus hung on every wall.
Mr. Fahmy and his cousin, Janette Naeim, 50, stayed put even as bombs rained down. Ms. Naeim was hit by a stray bullet as she went to fetch water. When two relatives died, they buried them outside their front door, they said, showing a pair of freshly dug mounds.
Both Orthodox Christians, they are testament to the enduring religious and ethnic diversity of a country whose image was often obscured by three decades of harsh Islamist rule. The war risks washing away that richness as well.
At the Marmina Coptic Orthodox church, shafts of dusty light shone through holes in a rooftop fresco of Jesus, punctured in the fighting. The bishop fled after R.S.F. fighters smashed into his home, firing guns and shouting "Where are the dollars?" said Andrews Hanna, a local businessman.
When Mr. Hanna turned up, an hour later, the floor was smeared with the blood of a priest who had shielded the bishop from rifle blows, he said. Then Mr. Hanna's factory was raided by fighters who carted away 8,000 motorbikes and rickshaws, he said. Weeks later, his family fled.
Families ate from a communal kitchen and fetched water from the Nile, he said, showing us around a mosque, a well-stocked pharmacy and apartments. His followers helped bury the dead, and at night they performed zikir, a devotional dance that is an expression of Sufi spirituality. "It soothed our souls," he said.
A soup kitchen still offered meals. Sheikh Elamin, a towering man in flowing green robes, said he paid for it all from his own pocket. Beyond running a Sufi Muslim order with branches in London, New York and Dubai, he was also a businessman who owned a gold mine and a meat export business, he said.
Before the war, the sheikh was sometimes criticized for his lavish choices, like chartering a private jet to attend the World Cup in Qatar in 2022. But his charity now has brought praise.
"In this time of war, he's become the most popular figure in the country -- period," said Suliman Baldo, a veteran Sudan analyst. "People need something positive to hold onto."
Nearby, we passed a giant mural with the word "Freedom," leftover from the protests of 2019 and pocked by gunfire. Down the street, men huddled over a pot of bubbling lentils as they prepared to return to their shattered homes -- a cautious gesture of hope as the war dragged on.
"We will have a beautiful future, God willing," said Mahmoud Mustafa, a rickshaw driver clutching a plastic food bowl.
He didn't even flinch when another artillery barrage rang out, sending more shells across the Nile.
The Militias
Hundreds of black-clad young women, turning in perfect unison, marched through a schoolyard in Omdurman early one morning, the latest recruits in a rapidly expanding conflict.
The war started as a dispute between two men -- Sudan's army chief, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces leader, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan. But since last fall, when a succession of R.S.F. victories set off widespread alarm, a proliferation of armed groups has joined the fight, mostly backing the military. There are rebels from Darfur, ethnic militias, Islamists once loyal to former President Bashir, and thousands of young people, women as well as men, recruited from the streets.
Even idealistic young Sudanese who once risked their lives to protest against Mr. Bashir and, later, the military, have joined in.
Whether the militias will decide the war, or cause it to spin entirely out of control, is unclear. Sudan's military tumbled into the war because it outsourced its fighting to a powerful group, the Rapid Support Forces, that ultimately turned against it.
Now, critics say, the military is in danger of repeating that mistake by empowering more militias.
Even some military leaders are worried. In March, a member of the military high command, Lt. Gen. Shams al-Din al-Kabbashi, warned that, unless the militias were kept in check, "the next danger will come from" them.
Days later he was rebuked by another commander, Lt. Gen. Yasser al-Atta, who said the army "blessed" the popular militias.
"Any mistakes can be corrected as we move forward," he said.
The Weapons Store
Wooden crates lay scattered across the weapons depot we sifted through next to an abandoned R.S.F. base. Any identifying marks -- serial numbers or other clues that showed who had supplied the weapons -- had been carefully scraped off. The foreign powers fueling Sudan's war seemed to be covering their tracks.
Yet traces remain.
American officials have grown increasingly critical of the United Arab Emirates, the war's biggest foreign sponsor. It has extensive gold and agricultural interests in Sudan, and before the war signed a deal to build a $ 6 billion port on the Red Sea. Since last year, it has smuggled weapons to the R.S.F. through a base in Chad, in breach of a U.N. arms embargo, The Times reported.
Egypt, by contrast, has backed Sudan's military. But it is the army's recent turn to Iran for drones and other weapons that has caused alarm in Washington, several Western officials said.
Russia seems to have helped both sides.
Earlier in the war, Wagner mercenaries supplied the R.S.F. with antiaircraft missiles, U.N. investigators say. Russians later traveled to Khartoum, where they trained fighters to shoot down Sudanese military warplanes, said two senior Sudanese officials who provided the Russians' names and details of their movements.
Today, nearly two dozen Wagner operatives remain in the capital, mostly Libyan and Syrian recruits, flying drones and firing mortars for the R.S.F., the Sudanese said.
The Russian presence even spurred Ukraine to deploy a small team of special forces to counter its nemesis abroad by helping the Sudanese military in Khartoum.
But Russia's posture may have changed since the death of Wagner's founder, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin. Following a visit to Port Sudan by Russia's Middle East envoy in April, a top Sudanese general said recently that Sudan was prepared to allow Russian naval access to its ports, a longstanding desire for Moscow, in exchange for arms and ammunition.
The foreign meddling is frustrating American- and Saudi-led diplomacy to reach a cease-fire, though critics say even those efforts to save Sudan have been shamefully weak. The country, they warn, is barreling into a protracted conflict that could lead to anarchy or rival fiefs, like Somalia in the 1990s or Libya after 2011.
The war could easily spill beyond Sudan's borders. It is already causing tensions inside the security services of Chad, and has cut off vital oil revenues for South Sudan. Now it risks sucking in Ethiopia, Africa's second-most populous country.
Sudanese officials accuse Ethiopia of backing the R.S.F. Meanwhile, Eritrea, Ethiopia's traditional enemy, has sided with Sudan's military. And thousands of rebels from Ethiopia's restive Tigray region are stationed at a camp in eastern Sudan, officials and aid groups said -- part of a combustible mix that threatens to open a new front in the war.
Some Sudanese in exile desperately want the outside world to intervene. But so far, they say, it's only made things worse.

KHARTOUM, Sudan — The gold market is a graveyard of rubble and dog-eaten corpses. The state TV station became a torture chamber. The national film archive was blown open in battle, its treasures now yellowing in the sun.
Artillery shells soar over the Nile, smashing into hospitals and houses. Residents bury their dead outside their front doors. Others march in formation, joining civilian militias. In a hushed famine ward, starving babies fight for life. Every few days, one of them dies.
Once a proud city of gleaming high-rises, oil wealth and five-star hotels on the Nile, Khartoum, the capital of Sudan and one of the largest cities in Africa, has been reduced to a charred battleground. A feud between two generals fighting for power has dragged the country into civil war and turned the city into ground zero for one of the world’s worst humanitarian catastrophes.
As many as 150,000 people have died since the conflict erupted last year, by American estimates. An additional 9 million have been forced from their homes, making Sudan home to the largest displacement crisis on Earth, the United Nations says. A famine looms that officials warn could kill hundreds of thousands of children in the coming months and, if unchecked, rival the great Ethiopian famine of the 1980s.
Fueling the chaos, Sudan has become a playground for foreign players like the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Russia and its Wagner mercenaries, and even a few Ukrainian special forces. They are all part of a volatile stew of outside interests pouring weapons or fighters into the conflict and hoping to grab the spoils of war — Sudan’s gold, for instance, or its perch on the Red Sea.
The greatest tragedy is that none of it was necessary, said Samawal Ahmed, as he picked his way through the remnants of a famous market, past looted jewelry stores and a mangled tank. A year ago, in the first weeks of the war, a rocket smashed into his apartment, and the medical lab where he worked closed down for good. Now he was back, to salvage what he could.
“I lost everything,” he said, holding a batch of documents pulled from the wreckage of his home: his children’s school certificates, his professional qualifications and a passport. Across the street, the withered remains of three fighters, reduced to bones, were splayed among the debris.
“It makes my stomach churn,” Ahmed said. “All this could have been avoided.”
The war erupted without warning in April 2023, when a standoff between Sudan’s military and a powerful paramilitary group it helped create — the Rapid Support Forces — burst into gunfire on the streets of Khartoum.
Few Sudanese expected it would last long. Since independence in 1956, their country has experienced more coups than any other in Africa, most short-lived and bloodless. The rivals this time — the national army and the paramilitary force that once did its bidding — had seized power together in 2021 but fell out over how to merge their armies.
Almost immediately, the fighting ripped across Khartoum and far beyond, in pulsing waves that quickly consumed Africa’s third-largest country. Sudanese have been stunned by the destruction, but neither side looks capable of victory, and the war is metastasizing into a devastating free-for-all.
Another genocide now threatens Darfur, the region that became synonymous with war crimes two decades ago. Fields have become battlegrounds in the country’s breadbasket. The health system is crumbling. And a plethora of armed groups, including hard-line Islamists, foreign mercenaries and even former pro-democracy protesters, has piled into the fight.
With U.S.-led peace talks stalled, the Sudanese state is collapsing and threatening to drag down a fragile region with it. Experts say it is a matter of time before one of Sudan’s many neighbors, like Chad, Eritrea or South Sudan, gets sucked in.
Though often overshadowed by the wars in the Gaza Strip and Ukraine, the conflict in Sudan has global ramifications. Iran, already allied with the Houthis in Yemen, is now backing military forces on both sides of the Red Sea. Europeans fear a wave of Sudanese migrants heading for their shores. A recent U.S. intelligence assessment warned that a lawless Sudan could become a haven for “terrorist and criminal networks.”
The New York Times spent three weeks traveling through Sudan, where few foreign reporters have gained access in the past year. Driving through sandstorms and dozens of checkpoints guarded by jumpy fighters, we traveled from Port Sudan, the new de facto capital on the Red Sea, to Khartoum, the ravaged city where the war began.
As we approached the capital, artillery boomed, a warplane swept overhead and, across the Nile, an oily plume of smoke rose from Sudan’s largest refinery — the latest flashpoint in a sprawling urban battle. With the city in tumult, we slept in an abandoned house, where a neighbor told of how a bomb killed his sister in their kitchen.
It was just one corner of a country three times larger than France. Yet it was possible to see, up close, the immense damage to a capital once considered a jewel on the Nile — and how, if unchecked, it could still get much worse.
The River
Gunfire and mortars splashed into the waters around Col. Osman Taha, a badly wounded officer in the Sudanese military, as he crossed the Nile on a moonless night in November. Around him, he recalled, other wounded soldiers huddled in the boat, hoping to avoid being hit again. Several died.
Taha made it to the far bank, and five days later his right leg was amputated. Even then, there was no respite. As he recovered in a military hospital overlooking the Nile, he said, shells slammed into its walls, fired by the Rapid Support Forces across the river. Patients moved their beds to avoid being hit as artillery fell.
The Nile has long defined Khartoum. Its tributaries merge in the city center before pushing north through the desert into Egypt. Now, the great river divides Khartoum militarily as well, yet another front line in a splintered capital.
Snipers nestle in the riverbank beneath a giant bridge, blown up in fighting, that slumps into the river. Drones swoop over the water, hunting for targets. And an island in the center of the Nile, where people once picnicked and swam, has become a kind of open-air prison controlled by the RSF, residents say.
“Watch your step,” Dr. Manahil Mohamed said as she led us up a sandbag-lined staircase to the fourth floor of the Aliaa Specialist Hospital, overlooking the Nile, where a line of blown-out windows offered a stark panorama.
On the deserted street below, burned-out vehicles clustered around the parliament building. In the distance stood the skeletal skyline of downtown Khartoum: government ministries, luxury hotels and mirrored high-rises that poked over the city’s poverty, many built during Sudan’s oil boom of the 1990s, now pocked by shelling or gutted by fire. Among them stood the old Republican Palace where followers of the Mahdi, a cleric, toppled and beheaded the country’s British governor-general, Charles Gordon, in 1885. It, too, has gone up in smoke.
In many ways, the destruction in Khartoum is a bitter historical reckoning. For more than half a century, Sudan’s military waged ugly wars in the nation’s distant peripheries, quelling rebellions by deploying ruthless militias. Khartoum was left untouched, its residents insulated from the consequences of wars fought in their name.
Now, the army’s most powerful creation — the Rapid Support Forces, a successor to the infamous Janjaweed militias that terrorized Darfur in the 2000s — has turned against the military and brought its trademark havoc to the capital.
Half of Khartoum state’s 9 million residents have fled, the United Nations estimates. Its international airport is closed, bullet-pocked jets abandoned on the runway. Nearly all of the city’s 1,060 bank branches have been robbed, officials say, and many thousands of cars stolen — some later located as far away as Niger, 1,500 miles west — in a campaign of street-by-street looting, most but not all, by the Rapid Support Forces.
“A city of this size, this wealth, and nothing remains?” said Mohamed Eldaw, a banker. “It must be the biggest episode of looting in history.”
At the Aliaa hospital, a triple thud of outgoing artillery shattered the calm. Warning of snipers, Mohamed urged us back inside.
For months, shells rained on the hospital, which mostly treated soldiers, often punching through its walls, she said. With no electricity, surgeons performed operations by the light of mobile phones.
Relief came in February when the military, armed with powerful new Iranian drones, recaptured this part of the city. (By contrast, the RSF uses drones supplied by the United Arab Emirates).
The military’s advance allowed hundreds of wounded troops to be evacuated by air to Port Sudan, where they lie in the crowded wards of a military hospital. One man had extensive facial injuries from a drone strike. Amputations were common.
The evacuees included Taha, who sat up in his bed to show a series of videos that he took during his last battle. Jubilant soldiers can be seen whooping and hugging, thinking they have won. Bleeding RSF fighters lie in the dust, and are kicked or taunted by the soldiers. The camera flips to show Taha, sweating heavily, his eyes glazed from battle.
But the soldiers had missed one RSF fighter, a sniper hidden in a residential block, and he shot Taha in the leg. Later that night, he said, medics moved him to an ammunition factory beside the Nile, where they embarked on their perilous crossing.
He was pessimistic the war would end anytime soon.
“Guns can’t solve this problem,” he said. “We need to talk peace.”
The Famine Ward
To Amna Amin, war means hunger.
After Rapid Support Forces fighters swept into her part of Omdurman, one of the three cities that make up greater Khartoum, Amin, 36, had no way to feed her five children.
Her husband, a gold miner in the distant north, had vanished. She lost her job as a cleaner. Neighbors shared what they could, but it was not enough. And soon she had two more mouths to feed: Iman and Ayman, twins born in September.
Within months, the twins started losing weight and suffering diarrhea, classic signs of malnutrition. Panicking, Amin bundled her children in her arms and made a desperate dash across the front line, traveling by donkey cart and minibus to reach Al Buluk children’s hospital, the last place they might be saved.
The United Nations has yet to officially declare a famine in Sudan, but few experts doubt that one is already underway in parts of Darfur and, shockingly, Khartoum.
More than 220,000 children could die in the coming months alone, the U.N. says. And both sides use hunger as a weapon of war, aid officials say. The army withholds visas, travel permits and permission to cross the front lines. Rapid Support Forces fighters have looted aid trucks and warehouses and raised their own obstacles.
“One of the most horrific situations on Earth is on a trajectory to get far, far worse,” said Tom Perriello, the U.S. envoy for Sudan.
At Al Buluk hospital, Amin cradled her daughter, rubbing her thin limbs and papery skin. The twins, Iman and Ayman, had been saved, for now.
But many more starving children arrive every day, and the entire health system is crumbling.
Half of Khartoum’s 50 hospitals are closed, many destroyed in fighting, said Dr. Sohail Albushra, a state health official. At the deserted city maternity hospital, a sniper’s nest was located in an empty ward.
The hospitals still functioning are strained to the point of collapse. Every day hundreds of new patients arrive at Al Nau hospital, near the front line in Omdurman. Many sleep two to a bed.
Patients spoke of pinballing from one neighborhood to another as the front line shifts, running a gantlet of checkpoints defended by fighters who demand money, steal phones and sometimes open fire.
Huda Adil, 30, was paralyzed from the waist down after RSF fighters shot up the bus she was traveling in. (Three passengers died, she said.)
Amouna Elhadi sat over her son, Hassan, a 14-year-old shot in the stomach by the mustanfareen, as new youth groups fighting alongside Sudan’s military have become known.
Mujahid Abdulaziz, however, was smiling.
For 10 weeks, he had been trying to get a bullet removed from his leg. An RSF fighter shot him at a checkpoint after a drone strike on a nearby fuel station killed several other fighters. “The guy was angry,” Abdulaziz said.
For Abdulaziz, a 20-year-old engineering student, it was just the start of a torturous search for help.
One hospital patched up his wound but could not extract the bullet. A second hospital couldn’t, either. He crossed the Nile three times, circling the capital in buses that passed through deserts and around a mountain. Finally, after a journey of 100 miles that should have been 10, he reached Al Nau hospital, where doctors pulled out the bullet, at last.
Not long ago, Abdulaziz believed he was part of an exciting future. He participated in the euphoric mass protests in 2019 that helped topple President Omar al-Bashir, Sudan’s autocratic ruler of three decades, a moment of triumph for the country. Two years later, he returned to the streets, defiantly flinging stones at riot police officers after the military coup that set back hopes for civilian rule.
Some protesters now run soup kitchens that provide much of the limited aid available in Khartoum.
But Abdulaziz just felt defeated.
Before the war, “we were just dreaming,” he said. “Those hopes are gone.”
Clinging to Hope
Mudassir Ibrahim, 50, lifted his shirt to show welts across his back — evidence, he said, of a week spent in RSF detention inside the headquarters of Sudan’s national radio and television station. His captors beat him with iron rods and electrical cables, he said: “It felt like death a thousand times over.”
At the television station in Omdurman, we saw evidence to back his claims. Ropes and other restraints hung from barred rooms in the finance department. Piles of dry excrement were scattered on the floor. Filthy walls were scrawled with names, pleas and snatches of poetry.
“The treachery of your tears is no use to fight injustice,” read one.
“Friends forever,” read another, under a list of six names.
Most of the compound stood in ruins. Its main building had been incinerated by airstrikes, while a film archive dating to the 1940s, one of the largest in Africa, had been blown open by gunfire. The RSF had retreated across the river, soldiers said, but some left behind their own wartime wisdom.
“As long as death is certain,” read a line scrawled on one wall, “don’t live like a coward.” (The RSF did not respond to the allegations of torture and other abuses by its fighters.)
As the fighting raged, some Omdurman residents refused to leave. “We were born here, we grew up here, and we will die here,” said Edward Fahmy, 73, sitting in the courtyard of his modest home in the old city, where pictures of Jesus hung on every wall.
Fahmy and his cousin, Janette Naeim, 50, stayed put even as bombs rained down. Naeim was hit by a stray bullet as she went to fetch water. When two relatives died, they buried them outside their front door, they said, showing a pair of freshly dug mounds.
Both Orthodox Christians, they are testament to the enduring religious and ethnic diversity of a country whose image was often obscured by three decades of harsh Islamist rule. The war risks washing away that richness as well.
At the Marmina Coptic Orthodox church, shafts of dusty light shone through holes in a rooftop fresco of Jesus, punctured in the fighting. The bishop fled after RSF fighters smashed into his home, firing guns and shouting “Where are the dollars?” said Andrews Hanna, a local businessperson.
When Hanna turned up, an hour later, the floor was smeared with the blood of a priest who had shielded the bishop from rifle blows, he said. Then Hanna’s factory was raided by fighters who carted away 8,000 motorbikes and rickshaws, he said. Weeks later, his family fled.
“We love this country,” Hanna said in Port Sudan. “The problem is that it has too many armies.”
A rare haven from the fighting was run by Sheikh Elamin Omar Elamin, a charismatic Sufi cleric who said he sheltered about 1,000 people at his sprawling compound in the old city for over a year. “I had to stay,” he said.
Families ate from a communal kitchen and fetched water from the Nile, he said, showing us around a mosque, a well-stocked pharmacy and apartments. His followers helped bury the dead, and at night they performed zikir, a devotional dance that is an expression of Sufi spirituality. “It soothed our souls,” he said.
A soup kitchen still offered meals. Sheikh Elamin, a towering man in flowing green robes, said he paid for it all from his own pocket. Beyond running a Sufi Muslim order with branches in London, New York and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, he was also a businessperson who owned a gold mine and a meat export business, he said.
Before the war, the sheikh was sometimes criticized for his lavish choices, like chartering a private jet to attend the World Cup in Qatar in 2022. But his charity now has brought praise.
“In this time of war, he’s become the most popular figure in the country — period,” said Suliman Baldo, a veteran Sudan analyst. “People need something positive to hold on to.”
Nearby, we passed a giant mural with the word “Freedom,” leftover from the protests of 2019 and pocked by gunfire. Down the street, men huddled over a pot of bubbling lentils as they prepared to return to their shattered homes — a cautious gesture of hope as the war dragged on.
“We will have a beautiful future, God willing,” said Mahmoud Mustafa, a rickshaw driver clutching a plastic food bowl.
He did not even flinch when another artillery barrage rang out, sending more shells across the Nile.
The Militias
Hundreds of black-clad young women, turning in perfect unison, marched through a schoolyard in Omdurman early one morning, the latest recruits in a rapidly expanding conflict.
The war started as a dispute between two men — Sudan’s army chief, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces leader, Lt. Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo. But since last fall, when a succession of RSF victories set off widespread alarm, a proliferation of armed groups has joined the fight, mostly backing the military. There are rebels from Darfur, ethnic militias, Islamists once loyal to al-Bashir, and thousands of young people, women as well as men, recruited from the streets.
Even idealistic young Sudanese who once risked their lives to protest against al-Bashir and, later, the military, have joined in.
Whether the militias will decide the war, or cause it to spin entirely out of control, is unclear. Sudan’s military tumbled into the war because it outsourced its fighting to a powerful group, the Rapid Support Forces, that ultimately turned against it.
Now, critics say, the military is in danger of repeating that mistake by empowering more militias.
Even some military leaders are worried. In March, a member of the military high command, Lt. Gen. Shams al-Din al-Kabbashi, warned that, unless the militias were kept in check, “the next danger will come from” them.
Days later he was rebuked by another commander, Lt. Gen. Yasser al-Atta, who said the army “blessed” the popular militias.
“Any mistakes can be corrected as we move forward,” he said.
The Weapons Store
Wooden crates lay scattered across the weapons depot we sifted through next to an abandoned RSF base. Any identifying marks — serial numbers or other clues that showed who had supplied the weapons — had been carefully scraped off. The foreign powers fueling Sudan’s war seemed to be covering their tracks.
Yet traces remain.
U.S. officials have grown increasingly critical of the United Arab Emirates, the war’s biggest foreign sponsor. It has extensive gold and agricultural interests in Sudan, and before the war signed a deal to build a $6 billion port on the Red Sea. Since last year, it has smuggled weapons to the RSF through a base in Chad, in breach of a U.N. arms embargo, the Times reported.
Egypt, by contrast, has backed Sudan’s military. But it is the army’s recent turn to Iran for drones and other weapons that has caused alarm in Washington, several Western officials said.
Russia seems to have helped both sides.
Earlier in the war, Wagner mercenaries supplied the RSF with anti-aircraft missiles, U.N. investigators say. Russians later traveled to Khartoum, where they trained fighters to shoot down Sudanese military warplanes, said two senior Sudanese officials who provided the Russians’ names and details of their movements.
Today, nearly two dozen Wagner operatives remain in the capital, mostly Libyan and Syrian recruits, flying drones and firing mortars for the RSF, the Sudanese said. The Russian presence even spurred Ukraine to deploy a small team of special forces to counter its nemesis abroad by helping the Sudanese military in Khartoum.
But Russia’s posture may have changed since the death of Wagner’s founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin. After a visit to Port Sudan by Russia’s Middle East envoy in April, a top Sudanese general said recently that Sudan was prepared to allow Russian naval access to its ports, a long-standing desire for Moscow, in exchange for arms and ammunition.
The foreign meddling is frustrating U.S.- and Saudi-led diplomacy to reach a cease-fire, though critics say even those efforts to save Sudan have been shamefully weak. The country, they warn, is barreling into a protracted conflict that could lead to anarchy or rival fiefs, like Somalia in the 1990s or Libya after 2011.
The war could easily spill beyond Sudan’s borders. It is already causing tensions inside the security services of Chad and has cut off vital oil revenues for South Sudan. Now it risks sucking in Ethiopia, Africa’s second-most populous country.
Sudanese officials accuse Ethiopia of backing the RSF. Meanwhile, Eritrea, Ethiopia’s traditional enemy, has sided with Sudan’s military. And thousands of rebels from Ethiopia’s restive Tigray region are stationed at a camp in eastern Sudan, officials and aid groups said — part of a combustible mix that threatens to open a new front in the war.
Some Sudanese in exile desperately want the outside world to intervene. But so far, they say, it’s only made things worse.
“It’s sheer madness,” said Ibrahim Elbadawi, a former economy minister now in Cairo, calling for a U.N. peacekeeping force to save his country from collapse.
“The people of Sudan demand it,” he said. “Enough is enough.”

Full text: More fun, less drudgery. That's my goal for the summer -- and specifically for my summer cooking. In my dreams, I'm whisking together a vinaigrette in a seaside cottage with a big breezy kitchen and a farm stand down the road (think Diane Keaton's place in "Something's Gotta Give"). While that's not the reality for most of us -- myself included -- you can still welcome that relaxed sensibility in the recipes you cook and how you cook them (barefoot, good music playing, windows thrown open -- or the A.C. on full blast).
We've rounded up 100 of our most delightful summer salads, desserts, easy dinners, grilling and no-cook recipes that will excite, not exhaust, you. The vast majority -- with the exception of the desserts, most of which take about an hour -- can be made in 30 minutes or less. (No kidding!) Quite a few travel well and taste great at practically any temperature, making them perfect for picnics. But since summer can look a lot like the rest of the year, with more sweat and sunblock, all are the kinds of dishes you can throw together on a busy weeknight when the kids are worn out from day camp and the traffic was hellish.

Spicy Watermelon Salad With Pineapple and Lime. A party salad if there ever was one, this watermelon, pineapple, jalapeño and feta situation goes great with practically anything hot off the grill.
Avocado Salad With Herbs and Capers. You need four perfectly ripe -- not too soft, not too hard -- avocados for this lush, yet fresh salad, so set them aside and keep watch. It'll be worth it.

Tomato Salad With Cucumber and Ginger. Thai papaya salad inspires this blend of tomatoes and cucumbers, dressed with a zingy mix of lime, fish sauce and chile, then tossed with peanuts, ginger, basil and cilantro.
Corn Salad With Mango and Halloumi. A jumble of flavors that works together beautifully: soft halloumi, sweet mango, crunchy corn and cucumbers and salty pita chips. Sub in fresh peaches for the mango if you're lucky enough to get your hands on a perfectly ripe one.
Puttanesca Chickpea-Tomato Salad. Classic puttanesca ingredients -- tomatoes, capers, olives and garlic -- are combined with chickpeas and Parmesan nubs for a substantial desk (or poolside if you're lucky) lunch.
Southern Broccoli Salad. Sometimes known as "candy broccoli" because of the on-the-sweet-side mayo dressing, this classic picnic salad is loaded with bacon, red onion, Cheddar, raisins and sunflower seeds. The recipe calls for blanching the broccoli briefly, but if you're in summer mode, letting it sit for a few hours in the fridge will soften it.
Cucumber-Avocado Salad. In this five-ingredient dish, crunchy cucumbers and silky avocados get a smattering of chopped scallions, a squeeze of lemon juice and a sprinkle of crushed red pepper.
Chopped Wedge Salad. All of the delightful parts of a wedge salad without any of the fork-and-knife gymnastics.

Sweet and Sour Eggplant With Garlic Chips. "Even my 8-year-old -- a known hater of eggplant -- declared it delicious," said Sarah G, a reader.
Tomato Risotto. Stir this dish regularly and keep an eye on it, but do so with a glass of wine in your other hand. The best kind of multitasking.
Caramelized Corn and Asparagus Pasta With Ricotta. A pinch of sugar helps speed up the caramelization of the corn (fresh or frozen!) in this fantastic summery dinner. Sub in zucchini for the asparagus if you like.

❖
Grilling
Sweet and Salty Grilled Steak With Cucumber Salad. Fish sauce, brown sugar, garlic, jalapeño and lime juice first marinate the steak, then dress the cucumber-radish salad.
Grilled Zucchini With Miso Glaze. Swiping zucchini with a miso-brown sugar glaze, then searing it with high heat means this sometimes-soggy squash retains a little of its pleasant bite.
Grilled Vegetables With Spicy Italian Neonata. A spicy condiment of anchovies, salami, olives and cherry peppers, neonata is the perfect complement to soft and silky grilled vegetables.
Shish Kebab. Why does meat taste better when it's served on a stick? Make this yogurt-marinated lamb version with beef if you prefer.

Grilled Salmon Salad With Lime, Chiles and Herbs. "Woah," wrote one reader about this vibrant full-meal salad that was inspired by nuoc cham. Sub in a different fish or chicken for the salmon.
Grilled Oysters With Hot Sauce Butter. A dollop of a hot-sauce-anchovy butter melts and mingles with the oyster's liquor while grilling, keeping the delicate meat fresh and juicy.
Honey Butter Grilled Corn. Drenching grilled corn in melted honey butter creates a glaze that makes even supermarket corn shine.
Grilled Chicken With Tomatoes and Corn. Once you're done grilling chicken breasts, slide them onto a bed of fresh tomatoes and corn. The juices drip down onto the vegetables, seasoning them with no effort on your part.
Spiced Grilled Halloumi. As simple as can be. Top slices of ruby red tomatoes with singed halloumi, then sprinkle them with coriander, cumin, crushed red pepper and a pinch of sugar.
Grilled Harissa Shrimp. A quick dip in harissa, honey and lemon juice before grilling takes run-of-the-mill grilled shrimp to the next level.

Shrimp Salad. Using both lemon zest and juice is the key to this creamy yet zippy shrimp salad. Toss in a pound of cooked orzo or ditalini for a potluck pasta salad.
White Bean Hummus With Tahini and Coriander. Instead of traditional chickpeas, white beans are used in this creamy dip. Miso, if you have it, lends a welcome earthy undertone.
Greek Goddess Dip. This bright green herby-feta dip is so good you'll want to eat it with a spoon.

Cold Tofu Salad With Tomatoes and Peaches. Silken tofu stands in for mozzarella in this vibrant vegan dish inspired by Italian caprese salad.

Ham and Jam Sandwich. Adding a generous smear of jam, Dijon mustard and a twist of freshly ground black pepper lends a little "je ne sais quoi" to this sweet riff on a jambon beurre.

More fun, less drudgery. That’s my goal for the summer — and specifically for my summer cooking. In my dreams, I’m whisking together a vinaigrette in a seaside cottage with a big breezy kitchen and a farm stand down the road (think Diane Keaton’s place in “Something’s Gotta Give”). While that’s not the reality for most of us — myself included — you can still welcome that relaxed sensibility in the recipes you cook and how you cook them (barefoot, good music playing, windows thrown open — or the air conditioning on full blast).
We’ve rounded up some of our most delightful summer salads, desserts, easy dinners, grilling and no-cook recipes that will excite, not exhaust, you. The vast majority — with the exception of the desserts, which take about an hour — can be made in 30 minutes or less. (No kidding!) Quite a few travel well and taste great at practically any temperature, making them perfect for picnics. But since summer can look a lot like the rest of the year, with more sweat and sunblock, all are the kinds of dishes you can throw together on a busy weeknight when the kids are worn out from day camp and the traffic was hellish.
Recipe: Grilled Harissa Shrimp
Harissa paste is a spicy North African condiment that is typically made from some combination of red chiles or peppers, garlic and a slew of fragrant spices, often including coriander and cumin. Here the paste is used alongside a bit of honey and lemon as a quick marinade for grilled shrimp. Prepared harissa varies quite a bit from brand to brand in its heat level, but this dish is meant to be punchy and spicy. Serve the grilled shrimp with rice or flatbread, or on top of a crunchy salad, and you’ll have an easy dinner sorted. Make sure that your grilling area is very well ventilated, as the paste will get quite smoky once it hits the hot grates.
By Yossy Arefi
Yield: 3 to 4 servings
Total time: 15 minutes
Ingredients:
1/4 cup harissa paste
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon lemon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving
1 tablespoon olive oil
Kosher salt
1 pound large peeled and deveined shrimp
Bamboo skewers
1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes (optional)
Preparation:
1. In a large bowl, combine the harissa, honey, lemon juice, olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. Add the shrimp and toss to coat. Let the shrimp marinate while you heat the grill (or grill pan) to medium-high. (If grilling indoors, you may want to open windows and make sure your space is very well ventilated, as the grilled shrimp might get quite smoky.)
2. Thread the shrimp on bamboo skewers while making sure to poke the skewer through the thick end and the tail. Alternate with tomatoes, if using.
3. Grill the shrimp until lightly charred and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Serve the shrimp with lemon wedges for squeezing over the top.

Recipe: Tajín Grilled Chicken
Tajín is a Mexican seasoning made from dried, ground red chiles, sea salt and dehydrated lime juice. It is great sprinkled over fresh cut fruit like mango and pineapple or rimmed on an ice cold margarita. But it is also an easy way to add chile and lime to your favorite grilled meats, rubs or sauces. In this dish, the lime in the Tajín balances out the sweetness from the agave syrup, while the red chiles complement the smoky flavor of the chipotles. Serve the chicken as is or on toasted hamburger buns with a schmear of mayonnaise, chopped grilled scallions, cilantro leaves and sliced pickled jalapeños. This Tajín sauce also would pair well with grilled bass, cod or salmon, or with shrimp skewers.
By Rick A. Martinez
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 35 minutes
Ingredients:
Vegetable oil, for the grill
8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs (about 2 pounds)
Sea salt (or kosher salt)
1/2 cup light agave syrup or honey
1/2 cup fresh orange juice
1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
3 chipotle chiles in adobo, finely chopped, plus 1/4 cup adobo sauce
6 garlic cloves, finely grated
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon Tajín Clásico
8 scallions, root ends trimmed
1/2 cup cilantro leaves and tender stems
Preparation:
1. Prepare a grill for medium-high, direct heat; clean the grates well, then brush them with vegetable oil. Alternatively, heat a grill pan on medium-high and brush the pan with oil.
2. Arrange the chicken on a sheet tray and generously season both sides with salt. Whisk together the agave syrup, orange juice, orange zest, chipotles, adobo, garlic, olive oil and Tajín in a medium bowl.
3. Brush both sides of the chicken with the Tajín sauce. Grill the chicken, turning and basting often with the Tajín sauce, until cooked through, charred but brick red and glazed, 7 to 9 minutes. Grill the scallions, turning occasionally, until lightly charred on all sides, about 5 minutes.
4. Serve the chicken with the grilled scallions, topped with cilantro.

Recipe: Crispy Cheddar Chicken Tacos
These quick tacos use leftover or store-bought rotisserie chicken, and have a satisfying crispy cheddar frico called a costra (crust) that is common both in taquerias in the northern half of Mexico and in the southwestern United States. In some taquerias, you can order a taco using only the costra as the shell without a tortilla. In this recipe, the tortilla and costra are layered together to wrap a simple but delicious shredded chicken and chipotle filling.
By Rick A. Martínez
Yield: 8 tacos
Total time: 35 minutes
Ingredients:
1/2 medium red onion, thinly sliced (lengthwise, from root to stem end)
1 cup hot water (tap water is fine)
Salt
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons fresh orange juice
2 cups shredded, cooked chicken, warmed
2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, chopped, plus 2 tablespoons adobo sauce
6 ounces medium cheddar, Monterey Jack or queso Chihuahua, grated
8 (6-inch) corn tortillas
Sliced avocado, salsa and lime wedges, for serving
Preparation:
1. Set an oven rack in the middle position; heat the oven to 375 degrees.
2. In a medium bowl, stir the onion, hot water and 1 teaspoon salt until the salt has dissolved. Let sit for 5 minutes. This will soften the onion and lessen any bitter or harsh flavors. Rinse the onion under cold water and drain. In the same bowl, toss the onion with the oregano, lime juice, orange juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt; reserve.
3. In a separate bowl, quickly toss together the chicken, peppers and adobo sauce, making sure the chicken is completely coated. Season with salt. Cover and keep warm.
4. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat (do not use foil or the cheese might stick). Arrange cheese in 8 equal mounds on the prepared baking sheet. Spread each mound evenly to about 3 inches wide, and space at least 1 inch apart. Bake until the cheese is bubbly and deep golden brown in spots and around the edges, about 14 minutes. Remove from the oven and place 1 tortilla over each cheese crust and return to the oven to heat the tortillas, about 2 minutes.
5. Use tongs to carefully remove each tortilla with its costra, flipping each one onto a plate so that the cheese is facing up. Top with chicken, onions, avocado, salsa and a squeeze of lime.
_______ Recipe: Pizza Salad
For pizza in salad form, this recipe tosses a crisp and briny mix of romaine lettuce, pepperoncini, black olives and red onion in a fresh, grated tomato vinaigrette. Spicy pepperoni strips are sizzled until crisp; their zesty fat gets sopped up by toasty breadcrumbs that are spiked with the classic New York slice flavors (oregano, garlic and red-pepper flakes). (You can make a big batch of these crumbs, store them in the fridge and use them to top pasta, eggs, roasted veggies and anything else you want to take to pizza town.) This salad is showered with the salty pepperoni crumbs, offset by mozzarella morsels running throughout.
By Sohla El-Waylly
Yield: 2 big salads or 4 side salads
Total time: 35 minutes
Ingredients:
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 ounces pepperoni slices (pork, turkey or plant-based), cut into thin strips (see Tip)
3/4 cup panko breadcrumbs
1 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons dried oregano
Salt
Red-pepper flakes
1 beefsteak tomato
1 tablespoon pepperoncini brine, plus more to taste
Granulated sugar (if needed)
1 large head romaine lettuce, roughly chopped
1/3 cup sliced pepperoncini, drained
1/3 cup sliced black olives
1/4 red onion, thinly sliced
4 ounces fresh mozzarella
Preparation:
1. In a medium nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet, add 2 tablespoons olive oil and the pepperoni and place over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until the pepperoni is rendered and crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and use a slotted spoon to transfer the pepperoni to a plate.
2. Return the skillet with the fat to medium-low heat. Add the breadcrumbs and cook, stirring frequently, until browned and toasty, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add the garlic powder, then the oregano, crumbling it between your fingers as you sprinkle it over the mixture. Add the pepperoni bits, scraping in any fat clinging to the plate, and stir until evenly combined. Season with salt and red-pepper flakes to taste.
3. On the large holes of a box grater, grate the tomato into a large bowl, discarding the remaining skin. Whisk in the pepperoncini brine and the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add salt, sugar and more brine to taste. Add the romaine, pepperoncini, olives and red onion; toss to combine.
4. Divide the salad among plates, pouring over any dressing remaining in the bowl. Tear mozzarella and divide over salad. Top with the pepperoni breadcrumbs and serve right away.
Tip: If using turkey pepperoni, increase the olive oil you use to cook the pepperoni to 3 tablespoons. If using a plant-based substitute, increase the initial oil to 4 tablespoons.
_______ Recipe: Gochujang Caramel Cookies
Gochujang, the fermented Korean chile paste, offers intrigue in this otherwise classic chewy sugar cookie. A gentle amount of ground cinnamon lends snickerdoodle vibes, and the dough is raked through with ripples of clay-red gochujang “caramel,” in which brown sugar and butter mellow the chile’s heat. Mixing this dough by hand is highly recommended for the most defined crinkles and the chewiest texture.
By Eric Kim
Yield: About 8 large cookies
Total time: 45 minutes
Ingredients:
1/2 cup (8 tablespoons)/115 grams unsalted butter, very soft
2 packed tablespoons dark brown sugar
1 heaping tablespoon gochujang
1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar
1 large egg, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon coarse kosher salt or 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cups/185 grams all-purpose flour
Preparation:
1. In a small bowl, stir together 1 tablespoon butter, the brown sugar and gochujang until smooth. Set aside for later, at room temperature.
2. In a large bowl, by hand, whisk together the remaining 7 tablespoons butter, the granulated sugar, egg, salt, cinnamon and vanilla until smooth, about 1 minute. Switch to a flexible spatula and stir in the baking soda. Add the flour and gently stir to combine. Place this large bowl in the refrigerator until the dough is less sticky but still soft and pliable, 15 to 20 minutes.
3. While the dough is chilling, heat the oven to 350 degrees and line 2 large sheet pans with parchment.
4. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. In 3 to 4 separately spaced out blobs, spoon the gochujang mixture over the cookie dough. Moving in long circular strokes, swirl the gochujang mixture into the cookie dough so you have streaks of orange-red rippled throughout the beige. Be sure not to overmix at this stage, as you want wide, distinct strips of gochujang.
5. Use an ice cream scoop to plop out 1/4-cup rounds spaced at least 3 inches apart on the sheet pans. (You should get 4 to 5 cookies per pan.) Bake until lightly golden at the edges and dry and set in the center, 11 to 13 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through. Let cool completely on the sheet pan; the cookies will flatten slightly and continue cooking as they cool. The cookies will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.
________ Recipe: Spicy Corn and Shishito Salad
In this recipe, shishito peppers are sliced, lightly sautéed, then tossed with raw summer corn and a cumin-lime vinaigrette for a summer salad that’s crunchy, smoky and a little spicy. Traditionally used in Japanese and Korean cooking, shishitos are small, thin-skinned green peppers that have become increasingly popular in the United States. They are typically mild in flavor, but the occasional pepper packs a spicy punch. If you can’t find them, use diced green bell peppers in their place. Finally, cilantro-averse cooks can substitute fresh mint.
By Lidey Heuck
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 15 minutes
Ingredients:
3 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
Kosher salt
1/3 cup diced red onion
1 garlic clove, minced
3 cups fresh corn kernels (from 4 to 6 ears of corn)
6 ounces shishito peppers, stemmed and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slices, or green bell peppers, stemmed and diced
1 large jalapeño, seeds and ribs removed, diced
1/4 cup grated Cotija or crumbled feta cheese (optional), or to taste
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems, plus more to taste
Preparation:
1. In a small bowl, whisk 2 tablespoons olive oil with the lime juice, cumin and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Stir in the red onion and garlic and set aside until ready to use. (Do this step first so the onions and garlic have time to mellow slightly in the dressing.)
2. Place the corn kernels in a large bowl and set aside. In a medium (10-inch) saute pan, heat the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add the shishitos, jalapeño and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the peppers are tender and beginning to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.
3. Add the peppers and dressing to the bowl with the corn and toss well. Add the cheese, if using, and toss. Garnish with cilantro.
_______ Recipe: Chez Panisse’s Blueberry Cobbler
This cobbler, which comes from the kitchens of Chez Panisse, prizes the berries above all, using only 1/3 cup of sugar. The dough rounds for the top are placed so they don’t cover all the berries, and the juice from the berries bubbles up around the dough.
Recipe from Lindsey Remolif Shere
Adapted by Molly O'Neill
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
Total time: 1 hour 15 minutes
Ingredients:
For the berries:
4 1/2 cups fresh blueberries
1/3 cup sugar
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
For the dough:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
3/4 cup heavy cream, plus additional for serving, if desired
Preparation:
1. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. To prepare the berries, place in a bowl and toss with the sugar and flour. Set aside.
2. To make the dough, mix the flour, salt, sugar and baking powder in a bowl. Cut in the butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the cream and mix lightly, just until the dry ingredients are moistened.
3. Put the blueberries in a 1 1/2-quart gratin or baking dish. Make patties out of the dough, 2 to 2 1/2 inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick. Arrange them over the top of the berries. Bake until the topping is brown and the juices bubble thickly around it, about 35 to 40 minutes.
4. Let cool slightly. Serve warm, with cream to pour on top, if desired.
Recipe: Sheet-Pan Baked Feta With Broccolini, Tomatoes and Lemon
When baked, feta gains an almost creamy texture, similar to goat cheese, but with feta’s characteristic tang. In this easy vegetarian sheet-pan dinner, Broccolini (or broccoli), grape tomatoes and lemon slices roast alongside the feta until the Broccolini crisp, the tomatoes burst and the lemon rinds soften. (Remember, Broccolini has a tender, delicious stalk, so only the bottom 1/2-inch needs to be trimmed.) Serve this dish over a pile of orzo for a complete meal. If you like, cut the Broccolini, feta and lemon into bite-size pieces and toss with the orzo.
By Yasmin Fahr
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 25 minutes
Ingredients:
1 bunch Broccolini, ends trimmed, thick stalks split lengthwise, or broccoli, stalks trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces
1 pint grape tomatoes, halved (about 2 cups)
1 small red onion, peeled, quartered and cut into 2-inch wedges
1 lemon, 1/2 cut into thin rounds and the remaining 1/2 left intact, for serving
3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
Kosher salt and black pepper
2 (6- to 8-ounce) blocks feta, cut into 1-inch slices
Cooked orzo or farro, for serving
1/2 cup fresh basil or cilantro leaves and fine stems, roughly chopped (optional)
Preparation:
1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees with a rack set in the lower third. On a sheet pan, combine the Broccolini, tomatoes, onion and lemon slices with the olive oil and toss. Add cumin and red-pepper flakes, season with salt and pepper, and toss again until evenly coated. Nestle the feta slices into the vegetables. (It’s OK if they break apart a little.)
2. Roast 15 to 20 minutes, stirring halfway through but leaving the feta in place, until the Broccolini is charred at the tips, the stems are easily pierced with a fork and the tomato skins start to blister and break down.
3. Serve over orzo or farro. Drizzle with olive oil and serve with the remaining lemon half for squeezing. Top with fresh herbs, if using.
_______ Recipe: White Bean Hummus With Tahini and Coriander
Coriander seeds add a welcome aroma to this white bean dip, rich with tahini and bright with lemon juice. The miso paste is optional, but it gives the mellow white beans a nice savory depth.

Total time: 5 minutes
Ingredients:
1 garlic clove
1 (15-ounce) can white cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup tahini

2 teaspoons coriander seeds, coarsely ground, or 1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander
2 teaspoons white miso paste (optional)
Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Full text: In addition to new Warner and HBO films, the streamer has a treasure trove of Golden Age classics, indie flicks and foreign films. Start with these.
'Good Time' (2017)
Summoning the grit and grime of New York's seedy underbelly, Josh and Benny Safdie nestle a touching portrait of brotherly love within a crime thriller that seethes like a burning ulcer. Robert Pattinson stars as a thief who takes increasingly desperate measures to spring his cognitively impaired brother (Benny Safdie) from Rikers Island after the two botch a bank robbery. As with other Safdie brothers films like "Heaven Knows What" and "Uncut Gems," "Good Time" sustains a gnawing tension from the start while evoking a bygone era of New York City filmmaking. Though Pattinson scrubs his performance of movie-star vanity, his ne'er-do-well character earn sympathy through scrappiness alone.
'Modern Times' (1936)
Nearly a decade after the first "talkie," Charlie Chaplin opted to keep his last performance as the Little Tramp silent, using sound to minimal (though exceptional) effect in his jaundiced take on the ills of the industrialized world. At once scabrously funny and disarmingly sweet, "Modern Times" follows the Tramp as he loses his job as a bolt-tightener at a factory, goes in and out of jail, and gets mistaken for a communist rabble-rouser, though he does find love with a streetwise gamine (Paulette Goddard). Noting its social commentary, Frank S. Nugent called it "a rousing, rib-tickling, gag-be-strewn jest for all that and in the best Chaplin manner."
'Coffee and Cigarettes' (2003)
In 1986, the same year he cast the Italian comic Roberto Benigni in his Bayou comedy "Down By Law," Jim Jarmusch made a black-and-white "Coffee and Cigarettes" short in which Benigni and the deadpan comic Steven Wright sat around puffing and sipping and sharing ideas, like Benigni's concept of freezing coffee into a "caffeine Popsicle." That short and a 1993 follow-up with Tom Waits and Iggy Pop are added to nine new conversations for this delightfully eccentric anthology film, which features such pairings as Jack and Meg White of the White Stripes, Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan, and Cate Blanchett and herself. A.O. Scott praised the film's "unmistakably nostalgic, even elegiac feel."
'Mikey & Nicky' (1976)
Released by Paramount Pictures at a time when the auteur inmates ran the studio asylum, writer-director Elaine May's vital crime drama was like her version of a heightened John Cassavetes production, only with her distinctly spiky brand of dark humor. As Mikey and Nicky, respectively, she cast Cassavetes and one of his troupe members, Peter Falk, as lovable lowlifes whose friendship is tested when Mikey summons Nicky to a hotel room and asks for help getting away from a mob hit. What follows is a wild, irrational, dark-night-of-the-soul odyssey that pushes the boundaries of commercial cinema. J. Hoberman praised it as the unique buddy movie that "shows bromance from the point of view of its victims."
'Kwaidan' (1965)
Drawn from Lafcadio Hearn's collections of Japanese folk tales, Masaki Kobayashi's visually arresting horror anthology tells four separate stories with no narrative overlap, which allows Kobayashi to give each its own supernatural texture. Much of the aesthetic language that would fuel the J-horror movement decades later with films like "Ringu" are present in stories like "Black Hair," in which a samurai returns to an eerier version of the wife he divorced, and "In a Cup of Tea," about the haunted soul of a samurai reflected in water. Bosley Crowther called it "a horror picture with an extraordinarily delicate and sensuous quality."
'The Informant!' (2009)
Kurt Eichenwald's nonfiction book about a whistle-blower who exposed price-fixing in the lysine business was an unlikely thriller, but Steven Soderbergh's screen adaptation does it one better by turning it into a zany Midwestern comedy. Packed with narration that gets into its lead character's odd obsessions and delusions, "The Informant!" stars Matt Damon as Mark Whitacre, a midlevel executive at Archer Daniels Midland in the 1990s who offers to assist the F.B.I. in a white-collar case but assumes far too active a role in the investigation. Despite the laughs, Manohla Dargis noted, "anger inspires its giggles, forces its tears and might even explain the fiery orange that colors so many faces."
'Carrie' (1976)
Coming-of-age films are often about teenage girls making an awkward transition into womanhood, and the potency of Brian De Palma's pulpy shocker, adapted from the novel by Stephen King, lies in its supernatural manifestation of familiar agonies. From the beginning, "Carrie" aligns itself with a misfit daughter (Sissy Spacek) of a Bible-thumping mother (Piper Laurie), who grows into violent telekinetic powers that she has trouble controlling, especially when prodded by classmates. When her anguish turns prom night into a gruesome affair, De Palma and Spacek pull off the neat trick of holding our sympathies as her psychic pain is unleashed.

The Elaborate Menu: A Little Dinner Theater
An act of altruism. An act of service. An act of love. Cooking for others has been called many things, but it is always an act.
“What is a party if not a private performance?” wrote Ruth Reichl in 1985, in the magazine Metropolitan Home. “When you invite people into your home, you are issuing invitations to a special sort of theater.”
Oceans of ink have been devoted to denouncing “entertaining” as fussy, but performances — good ones, at least — demand a bit of fuss. For hosts like myself, so much of the fun lies in the blocking and choreography, the set design, the script.
I’ve pinned poached shrimp to Styrofoam towers, printed out paper menus, made Dutch babies and latkes to order, stretched prep work across days and even designed custom matchbooks to grab on the way out, all in service of making my home feel like a sexy restaurant for the regulars of my life.
I’ve tried to contort myself into the shape of a nonchalant host, and it always feels like a sham. True effortlessness lies in ordering a few pies and tearing up some romaine to serve alongside. So why not lean into whimsy and work, and stretch yourself for an audience deserving of a show?
The following menu, enough for you and five guests, embraces the elaborate, and the many forms it can take. There are dressings and flourishes to make ahead for two sprightly salads; a dish of braised lentils that works as both side and vegetarian centerpiece; a lacquered, glistening bird fit for showy presentation; and even a project dessert that you can set aflame for your guests.
Call it extra, call it Marthaesque. But no one will call it boring.
— TANYA SICHYNSKY
Finger Food With a Little Fuss
Throughout this menu, there are little opportunities to take things over the top, and this appetizer is one of them. A slippery supermarket shrimp ring this is not. Poaching your own shrimp in a seasoned bath — as Eric Kim does — imparts the seafood with the subtle yet distinct aromas of chile and celery seed, and ensures none of it ends up rubbery. Sure, you could make a straightforward horseradish-y cocktail sauce, but why not make three dipping sauces? Many might, at first, gravitate toward the garlicky dill butter, but the real spotlight-stealer is the unexpected curried honey mustard.
Tip: Lay the shrimp atop a bed of ice on your biggest platter, or divvy them up across coupe glasses and spoon in some dip. Or if you’re lucky enough to have a tiered tray around (or can find one at a thrift store!), now is absolutely the moment to break it out, seafood tower style.
SHRIMP COCKTAIL
By Eric Kim
Yield: 8 servings
Total time: 15 minutes
Ingredients:
For the Shrimp:
2 pounds large (21- to 25-count) shrimp, shelled and deveined
Kosher salt
8 cups ice cubes (about 2 pounds), plus more for serving
1/4 cup mild red chile powder, gochugaru or sweet paprika with a dash of ground cayenne
1 tablespoon celery seeds
2 lemons
For the Cocktail Sauce:
1/2 cup ketchup
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons prepared horseradish
1 large garlic clove, finely grated
Kosher salt and black pepper
Tabasco sauce
For the Garlicky Dill Butter:
1/2 cup unsalted butter
2 large garlic cloves, finely grated
1/4 packed cup finely chopped fresh dill (from 1 small bunch)
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon granulated sugar
Kosher salt and black pepper
For the Curried Honey Mustard:
1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne
Kosher salt and black pepper
Preparation:
1. Make the shrimp: In a large bowl, toss together the shrimp and 2 teaspoons salt, and set aside. Keep the 8 cups ice nearby, either in another large bowl or directly in the icemaker tray of your refrigerator.
2. Meanwhile, fill a large pot with 8 cups water, 1/2 cup salt, the chile powder and celery seeds, and bring to a boil. Remove the pot from the heat and add the shrimp to the hot liquid, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through and no longer translucent on the inside, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Immediately dump the ice into the pot to stop the cooking, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is cool to warm or room temperature, about 1 minute. Pour the contents of the pot into a colander in the sink, then transfer the drained, celery seed-dotted shrimp to a large platter and refrigerate until ready to eat. Cut the lemons into quarters lengthwise, then cut each piece in half crosswise.
4. Make the cocktail sauce: In a small bowl, stir the ketchup, lemon juice, horseradish and garlic to combine, and season to taste with salt, pepper and Tabasco sauce.
5. Make the garlicky dill butter: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat or in the microwave. Add the garlic, dill, lemon juice and sugar to a small bowl and stir in the hot melted butter. Season generously with salt and pepper.
6. Make the curried honey mustard: In a small bowl, stir the mayonnaise, mustard, honey, lemon juice, curry powder and cayenne to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. All three sauces can be stored in separate airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. (The dill butter will need to be reheated in the microwave or on the stove over medium-low heat until liquid again.)
7. To serve, cover a large platter with cubed or crushed ice, top with the poached and cooled shrimp and scatter the lemon pieces all over. Serve with one or more of the dipping sauces on the side.
A Showy Whole Bird
A whole chicken is hardly demanding on the host, but it elicits some of the more passionate oohs and aahs from guests, especially if you present it in all its freshly roasted glory, then saunter off to the kitchen to expertly carve and plate it. For a bird reminiscent of both Cantonese soy sauce chicken and American Chinese orange chicken, Genevieve Ko pairs poultry with whole, peel-on tangerines, yielding a remarkable amount of flavor from just a few ingredients. The citrus slices soften in the chicken’s juices, giving the peels a candied quality that makes them a thrill to eat.
ROASTED ORANGE CHICKEN
By Genevieve Ko
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 1 hour 15 minutes
Ingredients:
5 small tangerines or clementines
1/2 packed cup dark brown sugar
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons rice vinegar or distilled white vinegar
1 teaspoon ground cayenne or other hot red ground chile
1 (4-pound) whole chicken
Salt and black pepper
8 slices peeled fresh ginger
Preparation:
1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
2. Squeeze 1/4 cup juice from 2 to 3 tangerines into a small bowl; reserve the spent peels. Cut the remaining tangerines into wedges with their peels intact, and set aside. Add the brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar and cayenne to the tangerine juice and whisk until the sugar dissolves.
3. Generously season the chicken inside and out with salt and pepper. Tuck the wingtips behind the body. Stuff the tangerine peels and 6 ginger slices into the cavity, then tie the legs together using kitchen twine. Place in a large ovenproof skillet, and scatter the tangerine wedges and remaining 2 slices ginger around the chicken.
4. Slowly pour the juice mixture all over the chicken, then slide the skillet into the oven. Roast for 30 minutes.
5. Using a large spoon or baster, quickly and carefully coat the chicken with the pan sauce. Continue roasting, basting every 10 minutes, until the chicken is browned and cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes longer. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast should register 155 degrees and, in the leg, 170 degrees. The chicken will continue to cook while it rests.
6. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for about 5 minutes. If the pan sauce isn’t already syrupy, bring it to a boil over medium-high heat on the stovetop. Be sure to wear oven mitts or use a kitchen towel to hold the skillet (the handle is hot). Cook, stirring occasionally, until the bubbles grow larger and paler brown, and the sauce is the consistency of syrup, about 5 minutes. Discard the ginger.
7. Serve the chicken whole or carved with the glaze poured all over the meat. Arrange the tangerine wedges from the pan around the bird. You can eat them, if you’d like.
A Dish on Double Duty
A substantial side dish that doubles as a vegetarian main ensures no eaters are left out of the fanfare. This Gabrielle Hamilton recipe is broken up into three delicious parts, providing the cook with a dish to linger over before guests arrive: the base of slowly simmered lentils fragrant with fennel; a middle layer of meaty mixed mushrooms, on which you can splurge, if you like; and a final flourish of buttery croutons flecked with parsley and lemon zest.
ROASTED MUSHROOMS WITH BRAISED BLACK LENTILS
By Gabrielle Hamilton
Yield: 8 servings
Total time: 1 1/2 hours
Ingredients:
2 pounds mixed mushrooms, such as cremini, shiitake or hen-of-the-woods
Kosher salt
Black pepper
Extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium white onion, minced
1 large bulb fennel, diced, stalk and fronds reserved
1/4 cup slivered garlic
2 cups black lentils, rinsed
2 bay leaves
1/2 cup unsalted butter
2 cups diced dense country bread (remove crusts before cutting)
1/4 cup finely chopped parsley
Zest of 2 lemons
Preparation:
1. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. For mushrooms, trim any woody stems, and clean with a damp kitchen towel as needed. Place face down on a parchment-lined sheet tray. Season assertively with salt and pepper. Generously drizzle with olive oil, and roast until tender, about 20 minutes. Set aside.
2. In a heavy-bottomed wide sauté pan, heat 1/4 cup olive oil over gentle heat. Add onion, fennel and garlic. Season with salt and black pepper, and cook until tender, stirring often, about 10 minutes, taking care not to brown the vegetables. Add the lentils, stirring to coat with the olive oil and vegetable mix. (Add more olive oil, if needed, to get a glossy coating on the lentils.) Cover just barely with cold water, add the bay leaves and fennel stalk, and season again with salt and pepper. Simmer, partly covered, until the lentils are tender but not mushy, stirring occasionally and adding water as needed, as you might for a risotto. (You want to end up with wet-juicy cooked seasoned lentils but not lentil soup.) Turn off heat, remove bay leaves and cooked-out fennel stems or fronds, and finish with a healthy drizzle of olive oil.
3. For croutons, melt the butter over medium heat in a skillet large enough to hold the diced bread in a single layer. Add the bread, stir to coat evenly with the butter and season with salt. Toast the croutons in the butter on the stovetop, stirring frequently, until golden brown and crispy. The butter will smell browned and toasted. Remove from the heat, season with salt and black pepper and allow to cool briefly before tossing with chopped parsley and lemon zest.
4. Combine lentils with the roasted mushrooms and any accrued roasted mushroom juices, scatter croutons over top and serve.
A Salad to Make You Blush
Apart from slicing the tomatoes and assembling, every step of this dynamic, restaurant-caliber salad from Hetty Lui McKinnon can be accomplished ahead of time. A day or two before the party, fry the shallots over low heat, paying close attention to them so they don’t venture a shade past light golden brown, and whisk up the tangy dressing.
HERBY TOMATO SALAD WITH TAMARIND-MAPLE DRESSING
By Hetty Lui McKinnon
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 30 minutes
Ingredients:
For the Salad:
2 pounds mixed tomatoes, such as cherry, heirloom, Sungold or beefsteak
Kosher salt and black pepper
1/2 bunch cilantro, leaves picked and stalks finely chopped
1 packed cup fresh basil leaves, preferably Thai
12 perilla, shiso or mint leaves, finely chopped
2 scallions, finely sliced
For the Fried Shallots:
3/4 cup neutral oil, such as grapeseed or vegetable
4 shallots, sliced into 1/16-inch-thick rounds
Sea salt
For the Dressing:
4 tablespoons tamarind concentrate
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, grated
1 garlic clove, grated
1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
1 teaspoon sea salt
Preparation:
1. Start the salad: Cut the tomatoes into different shapes — this creates different textures and visual interest — and place them in a colander. Sprinkle with a big pinch of salt, and set in the sink to drain as you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
2. Place a strainer over a heatproof bowl. Line a baking sheet or large plate with paper towels.
3. Prepare the fried shallots: Add oil and shallots to a medium saucepan, and place over low heat. Bring oil to a simmer, stirring shallots with a fork to separate the rings. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes until the shallots are light golden brown, watching them closely, as they will brown quickly toward the end of cooking. (They will continue to cook after out of the oil.)
4. Remove the shallots to the strainer to drain, then transfer them to the paper towels. Season with salt and allow to cool. Reserve the oil. Shallots can be fried 5 days ahead and stored in an airtight container at room temperature.
5. Prepare the dressing: Whisk together all the ingredients.
6. Assemble the salad: Combine the tomatoes, two-thirds of the herbs and scallions, and half the dressing. Season with salt and pepper, and toss to combine. To finish, top with remaining dressing, a drizzle of the shallot cooking oil and the rest of the herbs and scallions, then finally with the fried shallots. (Reserve remaining shallot oil for other uses, like vinaigrettes, stir-fries and soups.)
A Playful Nod to a Party Classic
At an elaborate dinner party, a “simple salad” has the potential to be anything but. So take a big bowl of crisp lettuces — that’s it! — and douse it in Jesse Szewczyk’s sour cream and onion dressing for a luxurious yet playful pop of green, inspired by a hall-of-fame party food. And because we’re in the business of going big, finish it all off with a handful of crushed potato chips.
Tip: The most cost-effective way to mimic the intimate ambience of your favorite restaurant? Low lighting (a mix of scentless taper candles and tea lights of various heights will do the trick) and some smooth and groovy tunes (Sade? Steely Dan? Whatever you like!) make all the difference. Any handwritten menus, name cards, florals or favors are just meringue on the baked Alaska.
GREEN SALAD WITH SOUR CREAM AND ONION DRESSING
By Jesse Szewczyk
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
Total time: 10 minutes
Ingredients:
1/2 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon onion powder
2 teaspoons honey or agave nectar
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce (optional)
1 garlic clove, finely grated or minced
Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and freshly ground pepper
1/4 cup finely chopped chives, plus more for serving
10 loosely packed cups torn or chopped lettuce leaves, such as butter lettuce or romaine hearts (about 8 to 10 ounces, depending on the variety)
Preparation:
1. Make the dressing: In a large bowl, combine the sour cream, vinegar, onion powder, honey, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, garlic and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Whisk until the mixture is completely smooth. Stir in the chives. (The dressing can be made up to 3 days in advance and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.)
2. Dress the salad: Add the lettuce to the dressing and gently toss until evenly coated. Taste for seasoning, adding salt or pepper as desired.
3. Serve the salad with additional chives sprinkled on top and a few more cracks of pepper.
Dessert and a Show
End the meal on a dramatic note with a project recipe that doubles as table-side entertainment. Zoë François’ birthday baked Alaska, adapted by Dorie Greenspan, allows you to make things as complicated or as easy as you’d like (you’ve already worked so hard!). Make ice cream from scratch or buy your favorite pints. Line the base with store-bought ladyfingers, as the recipe instructs, or go as far as to use homemade pound cake as your foundation. Nonnegotiable, though, is that the whole affair go up in flames.
BIRTHDAY BAKED ALASKA
By Dorie Greenspan
Yield: 12 servings
Total time: About 1 hour, plus at least 7 hours’ freezing
Ingredients:
For the Ice Cream Cake:
1 cup/125 grams sliced fresh strawberries (cut 1/4-inch thick; not thicker)
1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar
2 teaspoons fresh lime or lemon juice
1 pint/480 milliliters premium or homemade blueberry ice cream
1 pint/480 milliliters premium or homemade vanilla ice cream
1 cup/120 grams shredded, sweetened coconut
1 quart/960 milliliters premium or homemade strawberry ice cream
Enough ladyfingers to cover the bottom of the cake (about 10 to 20, depending on their size)
For the Swiss Meringue:
1 cup/240 milliliters egg whites (from about 8 large eggs)
2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar
1/4 cup/60 milliliters kirsch (omit if using a torch)
Preparation:
1. Make the cake: Line a 9-by-5-by-3-inch pan with plastic wrap or parchment, leaving an overhang.
2. Put sliced strawberries, sugar, and lime or lemon juice in a small bowl, stir and set aside for 2 hours while you put together the rest of the cake.
3. Each type of ice cream has to be softened before you can use it, so, as you need it, cut it into hunks, put the pieces in a large bowl, and beat them with a sturdy flexible spatula or wooden spoon until spreadable. If using homemade ice cream, take it straight from the ice cream maker.
4. Soften the blueberry ice cream, then spread it evenly over the bottom of the loaf pan. Smooth the top. Cover, and freeze for at least 1 hour.
5. Soften the vanilla ice cream, stir in the coconut, then smooth it over the blueberry ice cream. Level the top. Cover, and freeze for at least 1 hour.
6. Drain the strawberries. Soften the strawberry ice cream, and stir the berries into it. Spread the ice cream over vanilla layer, and smooth the top.
7. Gently press ladyfingers into the soft ice cream to make the base; don’t worry if you have bare spots. Cover, and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours. (Do this up to 1 week in advance of serving, if you’d like.)
8. At least 1 hour (or up to 8 hours) before serving, make the meringue: Simmer a few inches of water in a large saucepan that can hold the bowl of a stand mixer or large bowl that you can use with a hand mixer. Whisk together egg whites and sugar in the bowl, place over the water — making sure it’s not touching — and whisk until sugar is completely dissolved and smooth. The mixture should be 160 degrees. Don’t rush this; it needs about 10 minutes. If necessary, attach the bowl to the mixer, and fit with the whisk. Beat the meringue on medium-high speed for about 6 minutes, or until it’s fluffy, glossy and holds stiff peaks.
9. Unmold the cake onto a serving platter large enough to catch the kirsch, if you’re using it, and peel away the plastic or paper. Using a spatula, cover the sides with a thick layer of meringue — creating swirls, if you’d like — and cover the top with a thinner one.
10. Now, either pipe meringue spikes over the top, layer more on top, and swirl or spike it with the back of a spoon, or pull the meringue into points with your fingers. Continue until you’ve got a pattern you like. Freeze the cake for at least 1 hour.
11. To finish the cake, use a kitchen torch to brown the meringue on the top of the cake or use flaming kirsch: Put the kirsch in a small pan over low heat for about 2 minutes. Carefully light the kirsch with a long match. Slowly drizzle the flaming alcohol evenly over the entire cake, and watch it toast the meringue. It will burn off on its own.
12. Cut into thick slices, and serve immediately. You can keep the cake covered and frozen for a day, but it’s at its best the day it is made.
A Boozy, Batchable Beverage
Resist the temptation to play bartender all night. Instead, mix up Rebekah Peppler’s batched 50-50 martinis in advance so that everyone can prepare their own tipple as they snack on shrimp. Make two batches — one for the gin loyalists, one for the vodka apologists — and put them out on ice alongside glassware, preskewered stuffed olives, pickled onions and cornichons, bitters and brine, and twisted citrus peels for a communal cocktail hour.
BATCHED 50/50 MARTINI
By Rebekah Peppler
Yield: 6 (3 3/4-ounce) drinks
Ingredients:
9 ounces dry gin
9 ounces dry vermouth
4 1/2 ounces filtered water
Lemon twists, green olives, olive brine, cocktail onions and orange bitters, for serving
Preparation:
1. Combine the gin, vermouth and water in a spouted measuring cup or pitcher, or a medium bowl. Pour the cocktail blend, using a funnel if needed, into a 750-milliliter bottle; seal, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or up to 2 weeks. (You can also freeze the 50-50 martini for several hours before serving.)
2. To serve, pour 3 3/4 ounces into a coupe glass and serve immediately with assorted garnishes.
Tip: Several parts of this menu can be done in advance: You can build the inside of the baked Alaska an entire week ahead, and the meringue the morning of. Make both salad dressings and shrimp dips a couple of days in advance; you could even poach the shrimp the day before. And you can also prepare lentils and mushrooms a few hours ahead and gently warm them before serving.

The Effortless Menu: A Feast That Requires No Thought
“A good dinner is of great importance to good talk,” Virginia Woolf, a professed fan of the feast, writes in “A Room of One’s Own.”
But it has taken me nearly two decades to understand that one shouldn’t come at the expense of another.
For years, I was the kind of host who thought dinner had to be an event: There must be concepts, two-day cassoulets, endless pizzas flowing from an oven. I’d work until the very last minute, or sometimes well into the party, then finally sit down, exhausted, short on coherent thoughts and covered in flour, just in time to ask everyone if they were enjoying everything.
They’re enjoying everything, right?
Then one Christmas, after spending six hours on a spread for two people, I finally realized how much fun I wasn’t having. It was too much pressure — on me, on my long-suffering guests who, to my surprise, just wanted to hang out with me, not my handiwork.
With that in mind, I present a breezy menu that’s easy and actually fun to put together, my dream dinner party for six: an effortless large-format salmon, a cucumber-avocado salad that sings, a strawberry cake. Each feels lush, abundant and, dare I say, impressive. But with just a few ingredients to shop for and minimal prep, they won’t leave you drained.
Scale it up! Scale it down! Do what comes most natural. In short, have fun, have a few drinks and get to the point where, Woolf writes, there’s “no need to hurry. No need to sparkle. No need to be anybody but oneself.”
It’s your party, after all. Remember to invite yourself.

The Ultimate Conversation Starter
Kick off this especially relaxed celebration with this irresistible recipe from Yossy Arefi. A tangy mix of yogurt and feta, brightened with herbs, it comes together lightning-fast in a food processor and is impossible to stop eating. Serve it alongside some pita chips and a verdant mix of vegetables for a starter that’ll move even the most introverted snack-table hoverers to party.
HERBY FETA AND YOGURT DIP
By Yossy Arefi
Yield: 6 servings (about 1 1/4 cups)
Total time: 5 minutes, plus chilling
Ingredients:
1 cup full-fat Greek yogurt
3/4 cup crumbled feta (about 130 grams)
1 tablespoon lemon juice
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, plus more for serving
2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint, plus more for serving
2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions, plus more for serving
2 teaspoons dried sumac, plus more for serving
Salt, to taste
Olive oil, for serving
Pita chips or crudités, for serving
Preparation:
1. Add the yogurt, feta and lemon juice to the bowl of a food processor. Purée the mixture until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the parsley, mint, scallions and sumac, and pulse a few times just to combine.
2. Transfer the dip to a bowl, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
3. Just before serving, give the dip a good stir and add salt to taste, if necessary. Top the dip with a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle with additional parsley, mint, scallions and sumac. Serve with pita chips or crudités. Store leftovers, covered, in the fridge for up to 3 days.
An Easygoing Star
This salmon is arguably the chillest guest at the table, down for pretty much whatever. Ali Slagle roasts it simply and slowly in a pool of fragrant olive oil enhanced with whatever you want to throw in: Mellow bay leaves and garlic, maybe even some olives are especially nice for this menu. Individual fillets make for easy serving and doubling, tripling or quadrupling, but a whole slab of salmon makes for a showstopping centerpiece without much effort.
OLIVE OIL BAKED SALMON
By Ali Slagle
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 25 minutes
Ingredients:
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets or 1 (1 1/2-pound) salmon fillet (skin-on or skinless), patted dry
Salt and pepper
2 lemons
Optional flavorings: rosemary, thyme or oregano sprigs; smashed garlic; fresh or dried chile; olives; anchovies; bay leaves; crushed fennel or coriander seeds
Preparation:
1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Drizzle the oil in a baking dish that will fit the salmon. Place the salmon in the dish, skin-side down if applicable. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Using a vegetable peeler, peel thick strips of zest from 1 lemon, then add to the baking dish. Juice 3 tablespoons of the lemon and pour over the salmon. Nestle in the optional flavorings if using. Bake, basting halfway through with the lemon oil, until just cooked through, 13 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of the fillets. (You will know if the salmon is done when the fish flakes when cut into with a knife or fork or when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part reaches 120 degrees.)
3. Transfer the salmon to plates to rest at least 5 minutes; discard the skin if applicable. Remove and discard the lemon peels and any aromatics you don’t want to eat, like herb sprigs. Squeeze about 1 tablespoon of the reserved lemon juice into the baking dish until the sauce is tangy but not puckery. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Eat the salmon with a spoonful of the lemon sauce.
A Crunchy Salad Tinged With Sesame
It can be hard to nail a dish that’s equal parts crisp and creamy, but Hetty Lui McKinnon does so with finesse. This no-cook salad comes together in 10 minutes — hoping your avocados are sufficiently ripe may be the only stressful part — and can be easily prepared as the salmon roasts.
SESAME CUCUMBER AND AVOCADO SALAD
By Hetty Lui McKinnon
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 10 minutes
Ingredients:
For the sesame dressing:
2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce or tamari
1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
For the salad:
2 ripe avocados
1 pound cucumbers (such as Persian or English), trimmed and thinly sliced
2 green, red or purple scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced
Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
Toasted sesame seeds, for topping
Preparation:
1. Make the dressing: Place the sesame oil, rice vinegar, sesame seeds, sugar, soy sauce and red-pepper flakes into a small bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of water and whisk until emulsified. Taste, and adjust seasonings. (Dressing should taste acidic, a little sweet and salty.)
2. When you’re ready to eat, prepare the salad: Halve the avocados and discard the pits. Using a small paring knife, carefully score the avocado flesh into 1/2-inch cubes, avoiding cutting through the skin. Use a large spoon to scoop out the avocado flesh (in one spoonful, if possible), as close to the skin as possible. Transfer avocado cubes to a large bowl and add the dressing; toss gently.
3. Add the cucumbers and scallions and toss everything together. Season with salt and black pepper, top with more sesame seeds, and serve immediately.
A Jam-Packed Finish
Even the most inexperienced bakers can pull off this practically one-bowl cake from Jerrelle Guy, and guests will clamor for the recipe. To both make it easier and surprisingly more delicious, skip hulling the fruit altogether by using frozen thawed berries. A dusting of Demerara sugar, cinnamon and/or salt before baking amps up the deliciousness. Whipped cream is a gorgeous accompaniment, but nothing beats streams of vanilla ice cream running along this cake while it’s still warm.
Tip: When it comes to decorating, do only the things that bring you joy. Do you live to arrange flowers? Lose yourself in making a bouquet. Do you spend your downtime thrifting plates? Put them all out! Anything else is bound to feel like a chore.
STRAWBERRY SPOON CAKE
By Jerrelle Guy
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 30 minutes, plus cooling
Ingredients:
1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted, plus more for greasing
5 ounces/145 grams frozen and thawed or fresh, hulled strawberries (about 1 cup)
2/3 cup/150 grams packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup/120 milliliters whole milk, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
Vanilla ice cream, for serving
Preparation:
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees and grease an 8-inch (square or round) baking dish with butter. Set aside.
2. Using your hands or the back of a fork, mash the berries to release all their juices, and stir in 1/3 cup of the brown sugar. Set aside.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the melted butter, remaining 1/3 cup brown sugar, milk and salt, then add the flour and baking powder and continue whisking just until the batter is smooth. Transfer the batter (it’s not much) to the greased baking dish, and spread evenly into corners.
4. Spoon the strawberries and all their juices over the top of the cake batter. Place in the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or just when a toothpick comes out clean in the center. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 3 to 5 minutes before spooning into bowls. Serve warm with ice cream.
A Breezy Mocktail
This simple nonalcoholic tonic from Rebekah Peppler drinks like a grown-up lemonade, with just enough salt and depth to feel sophisticated. And unlike a lot of mocktails, it comes together without any advance prep, thanks to some store-bought preserved lemons. Spike it, if you like, but there’s no need. It’s already an adult beverage.
Tip: Let people bring whatever drinks they want: wine, beer, fun sodas. Giving people a chance to share and discuss their picks is part of the fun. But if you know someone isn’t drinking, it’s always a power move — and deeply appreciated — to keep something that isn’t tap water around.
NONALCOHOLIC DIRTY LEMON TONIC
Rebekah Peppler
Yield: 1 drink
Total time: 5 minutes
Ingredients:
2 teaspoons finely chopped preserved lemon, store-bought or homemade
5 very thinly sliced fresh lemon wheels
1 teaspoon granulated sugar
Ice
4 ounces dry tonic water, chilled
Slice of preserved lemon rind, green olives (such as Castelvetrano or Manzanilla) and half wheel of lemon, for garnish
Preparation:
1. In the bottom of a sturdy rocks glass, add the preserved lemon, lemon wheels and sugar. Muddle until the sugar dissolves and the lemon wheels release their juices. Add the ice to the glass and top with tonic water.
2. Thread a skewer with a slice of preserved lemon rind, a few olives and a lemon half wheel; garnish.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This week in Newly Reviewed, Martha Schwendener covers Tamiko Nishimura's arresting black-and-white photographs, Tanya Merrill's playful portraits and Enrique Martínez Celaya's link to a Spanish master.
Tamiko Nishimura
Through June 8. Alison Bradley Projects, 526 West 26th Street, Manhattan; 646-476-8409, alisonbradleyprojects.com.
The best photography show in town is also the American debut for the Japanese photographer Tamiko Nishimura, who is in her mid-70s. Her exhibition, "Journeys," organized by Pauline Vermare, a curator at the Brooklyn Museum, serves as an excellent introduction to this artist, who graduated from the Tokyo College of Photography in 1969 and has had a full career in Japan but is less known abroad.
The photographs in "Journeys," mostly from the 1970s, feature sharply oblique angles, grainy surfaces and subjects -- largely women and children -- turned away from their viewers. Telephone wires cut through urban landscapes, and roads lead to places outside the picture frame. There are echoes of the French master Eugène Atget, with his uncanny shop windows, and the Surrealists who distorted their pictures. However, the photographs fall very much in line with the radical Japanese Provoke movement and artists like Daido Moriyama, who offered a sharper, more critical view of Japan than what was seen in the mainstream media.
Most of the photographs here are vintage prints, and several photography books display a medium in which Japanese artists historically excelled. (Nishimura's first photobook, "Shikishima," was published in 1973 and captured her journeys around Japan.) This show is important for photography experts as well as for anyone who wants a window into the art and craft of Japanese photography in the 20th century, and particularly with a sly, insurgently feminist perspective.
Tanya Merrill
Through May 18. 303 Gallery, 555 West 21st Street, Manhattan; 212-255-1121, 303gallery.com.
I was showing someone an image on my phone of the titular canvas in Tanya Merrill's "Watching Women Give Birth on the Internet and Other Ways of Looking" at 303 Gallery and they asked, "Is that a thing?" (i.e., women giving birth on the internet). Well, of course it's a thing: Everything's on the internet, just as for thousands of years, painting was the clearinghouse for representing human experience, from the birthing of babies to memorializing deaths.
Nine paintings are here, and they offer astute, playful depictions of how we look at the world today, through art history and newer digital means. There is a painting of a woman on the couch with a laptop; another with a Venus-like pregnant woman taking a selfie; and a zany composition of human and animal skeletons hovering over a village that harks back to pictures of people confronting death or pandemics.
The show's title feels important, too. "Ways of Looking" conjures, for me at least, John Berger's seminal book, "Ways of Seeing" (1972), based on a BBC television series. Berger looked at the social and political systems that produced, for instance, a Dutch portrait, rather than merely marveling over its surface.
Merrill is more lighthearted than Berger, but the laptops and computer keys lined up like tiles in her paintings remind us that ways of looking are determined not just by social and political elements, but also by the technology that surrounds and conditions us.
The Word-Shimmering Sea: Diego Velázquez / Enrique Martínez Celaya
Through July 14. The Hispanic Society Museum & Library, 613 West 155th Street, Manhattan; 212-926-2234, hispanicsociety.org.
There are places you can't easily return to, like childhood or, for many migrants and refugees, the country where they were born. This was true for Enrique Martínez Celaya, who was born in Cuba and relocated with his family to Madrid when he was a young boy. Celaya, now almost 60, returned to Cuba only in 2019, but he has found a way of retrieving both childhood and homeland in this impressive exhibition at the Hispanic Society.
Large canvases by Celaya include blown-up snippets from his childhood notebook, surrounded by interpretations of waves and seascapes. In a stroke of kismet, the notebook from which these early drawings were copied was given to him by his mother and featured a reproduction of a painting on its cover: Diego Velázquez's "Portrait of a Little Girl" circa 1638-42, which is in the collection of the Hispanic Society. That painting is displayed at one end of the room.
Objects and their historical hierarchies are irreverently jumbled in the show: Velázquez, the great Spanish painter, sits alongside Celaya's childish doodles. In another series of paintings by Celaya, the "Little Girl" holds objects that he coveted as a boy. The exhibition also includes work by other artists, like the 1971 notebook of Emilio Sánchez, an artist born in Cuba in 1921 who never went back to his homeland after 1960. In the end, the subject of the exhibition is really an immaterial poetic thread in which memory is fleeting but art, in its various forms, connects people, places and history.
Last Chance
Carole Gibbons
Through May 4. White Columns, 91 Horatio Street, Manhattan; 212-924-4212, whitecolumns.org.
As other writers have noted, the Scottish painter Carole Gibbons has an extraordinary gift for color. The dozen still lifes and one self-portrait in her imposing, and belated, American debut (she is 88) at White Columns favor complex earth tones offset by searing hot pink and turquoise. These unlikely combinations are bolstered by an awkward way with form, tables that tilt and vases whose upper lips float away.
What photographs don't capture so well is the imposing internal scale of Gibbons's compositions, which makes most of the paintings here larger-than-life still lifes. Everything about them projects forward and gives the show a startling jolt in person. Gibbons's influences include Gauguin, Bonnard and Picasso. (Note the pink Picassoid gaping compote in "Still Life, Pink Bowl and Fruit" (from around 1996-98). But it's also possible to see these works as filtering the domesticity of the School of Paris painting through Abstract Expressionism's often raw boldness.
While Gibbons applies her heated pastels in relatively flat and thick layers, elsewhere she often varies color and brushwork, creating forms that feel light, even hollow. We see through the artist's right shoulder in "Self-Portrait With Muse" while her face is another kind of hollow: an empty-eyed mask not unlike the visage in Matisse's "Portrait of Yvonne Landsberg" (1914, Philadelphia Museum of Art).
Another jolt is simply Gibbons's obscurity. Her work has not been shown much outside of Scotland. It could have easily been included in the Royal Academy's "The New Spirit in Painting" show in 1981, which signaled the return of various sorts of figurative painting to the mainstream. But worry not, Gibbon's art will find its place in history. ROBERTA SMITH
Candace Hill-Montgomery
Through May 4. Blank Forms, 468 Grand Avenue, Brooklyn; (347) 916-0833, blankforms.org.
Candace Hill-Montgomery's remarkable résumé includes everything from runway modeling to babysitting Count Basie's daughter while she was growing up in Queens. She exhibited at Artists Space in 1979 and created installations devoted to Black activists like Fred Hampton and to cuts in federal assistance. However, she's been absent from the New York gallery scene since the early 1980s, and her current show of textiles made between 2016 and 2023 at Blank Forms offers a strong reintroduction.
A majority of the works in "Pretty Birds Peer Speak Sow Peculiar" are small weavings created on a handmade loom. Like jazz musicians improvising, Hill-Montgomery goes way off the grid of the loom, piecing together different sections and attaching non-textile elements. One work is dedicated to "the Carters" (that is, Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, Jay-Z and family) and has foam earplugs dangling from its threads. Another has a 3D-printed chain, while a third has a skirt of little pendant weavings that echo the patterns on afghans. Other works are dedicated to Kanye West, Richard III and a secret trip to Afghanistan that Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California took in 2019.
From the famous Bauhaus, where women who wanted to paint were sent to the weaving workshop, to the Black female artists in Alabama making Gee's Bend quilts, fiber arts have proven to be a powerful vehicle for some of the most canny and talented artists in the last century. Hill-Montgomery's weavings add another entry to this field. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Al Freeman
Through May 6. Venus Over Manhattan, 39 Great Jones Street, Manhattan; 212-980-0700, venusovermanhattan.com.
Through May 24. 56 Henry, 56 Henry Street, Manhattan; 646-858-0800, 56henry.nyc
Al Freeman makes satirical, Claes Oldenburg-style sculptures of beer cans, electrical cords and other lowly objects. She finds absurd photos on the internet to juxtapose with canonical paintings that happen to be similar. But I didn't realize until this double show of her drawings of book and album covers that she's basically a cartoonist.
A good drawing lets you see the world not just through someone else's eyes, but through her mind. And Freeman's mind, it turns out, is a homespun and jokey but curiously earnest place, where the well-known artists and writers of her parents' generation nestle together in comfortable free-for-all. Philip Roth's "Portnoy's Complaint," Joan Didion's "White Album," Roald Dahl's "The Twits" -- Freeman's drawings of their covers are all the same size, their edges are all a little wonky, their spines are rendered with comic-strip Cubism as stripes on the left. Sometimes Freeman's choice of a title -- e.g., Danielle Steel's "Daddy," or a tattered blue Bible -- seems to mean something special. Sometimes it offers the chance for her deft, charming line to "cover" someone else's art, like Andy Warhol's flowers, the blood vessels on the "Gray's Anatomy" textbook, or Quentin Blake's unforgettable illustration of the Twits.
But sometimes, as with a Japanese edition of Paul Simon's single "You Can Call Me Al," the only obvious significance of the subject is its very mundane specificity. It's a grain of human experience that artist and viewer, by means of the drawing, can share. WILL HEINRICH
More to See
Richmond Barthé
Through May 31. Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, 100 11th Avenue, Manhattan; 212-247-0082, MichaelRosenfeld.com.
Richmond Barthé, the great African American sculptor, gets kudos for his realism, but that's faint praise that damns him: In the 1930s, when his career took off, there were hundreds of artists who had as fine a technique; there are still lots in Times Square, sculpting tourists' faces in clay.
Looking at the 16 busts and figures in the Barthé survey at Rosenfeld -- it's curated by the British artist Isaac Julien, who has a stunning video in the Whitney Biennial -- I realized that it's best to ignore technique and to think of them as three-dimensional photographs, or as much as you possibly could before the age of 3-D scanners. The sculptures look forward to our technology, not backward at traditional realism.
The best of Barthés's figures make his Black sitters as directly available as possible to our eyes, the way a photo seems to. There's no interfering dose of modernist style, which was imbued with stereotypes about Blackness and "primitive" African art that invoked ideas of the "savage" and the "primeval," or, calling on an opposite set of clichés, of the "Edenic" and "authentic." Those were applied to African Americans in Barthé's era, forcing them into cultural pigeonholes.
He gives his subjects more room to breathe.
"African Woman," from 1935, shows someone whose hairdo may distance her from 1930s America, but she's not exotic or ancestral. She's another person of today who happens to come from far away.
The male head in "The Negro Looks Ahead" enacts its title by just being there and looking out onto the world.
Three portraits of Black boys are just three children waiting to grow up, into a world they still imagine might treat them fairly. BLAKE GOPNIK
Life Cycles: The Materials of Contemporary Design
Through July 7. Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan; 212-708-9400, moma.org.
My favorite clock of all time is a video: A camera looks down onto two skinny mounds of garbage, maybe 20 and 15 feet long, meeting at one end like the hour and minute hands on a watchface; for the 12 hours of the video, we see two men with brooms sweeping these "hands" into ever new positions, at a pace that keeps time.
The piece is by the Dutch designer Maarten Baas, and it's among the 80 works in "Life Cycles: The Materials of Contemporary Design," a group show now in MoMA's street-level gallery, which has free admission.
The "materials" of today's most compelling design turn out to be ideas, even ethics, not the chrome or bent wood that MoMA's title would once have invoked. This show's ethical ideas center on the environment and how we might manage not to abuse it.
Baas's "Sweeper's Clock," is perfectly functional -- could I view it on an Apple Watch? -- but it also works as a meditation on the Sisyphean, 24/7 task of dealing with the trash we generate.
All-black dishes by Kosuke Araki look very like the minimalist "black basalt" china designed by Josiah Wedgwood way back in 1768 (it's some of the oldest "modernism" claimed by MoMA) except that Araki's versions are made with carbonized food waste.
Food not at all wasted, but consumed -- by cattle -- goes into making Adhi Nugraha's lamps and speakers, as explained by the title of the series they're from: "Cow Dung." BLAKE GOPNIK
Beau Dick
Through May 11. Andrew Kreps Gallery, 22 Cortlandt Alley & 394 Broadway, Manhattan; 212-741-8849, andrewkreps.com.
Not many people have the balance of Beau Dick (1955-2017). An activist and artist, he was a devotee of the wealth-redistributing feast known as the potlatch, which he called "the best form of resistance we have" against Western capitalism. He made masks for ceremonial dances within his Kwakwaka'wakw community in Pacific Northwest Canada and restored the practice, long discouraged by Western anthropologists, of burning them after use.
But he also sent his masks out into the gallery system, and the 23 examples now at Andrew Kreps, made between 1979 and 2016, are one of the most beautiful exhibits I've ever seen. As is often the case with ritual implements, Dick's masks bring with them a sense of life, a vividness and allure, that conventional art works, made only to be bought and sold, can hardly compete with.
But they're equally stunning even if you pretend they're just sculptures. They stand for traditional characters, like the wild woman of the woods, but the artist's inspired carving makes them as supple, as particular and as expressive as living actors. Without being flashy about it, the masks' sharp lines and bright acrylic colors also illustrate Dick's awareness of all the other currents of 20th-century art.
In a mask titled "Wind," a white-painted face purses bright red lips, and its cheeks sink in with perfect anatomical fidelity. The eyeholes, one inch deep, are outlined in black, but their white inner surfaces, coming in and out of view as you move from side to side for a closer look, seem to be blinking. WILL HEINRICH
Meghan Brady
Through May 11. Mrs., 60-40 56th Drive, Maspeth, Queens; 347-841-6149, mrsgallery.com.
The prolific painter Meghan Brady's latest body of work fills two galleries, one in Maspeth, Queens, and one at Dunes Gallery in Portland, Maine, a couple of hours from her home base in Camden. You may not get to both (I only made it to Maspeth), but in either you'll find striking, paper-cut-like patterns rendered in oil over acrylic in an alluring range of scales, from nearly pocket-size to over six feet tall.
Brady's distinctive, milky palette is bright but nonconfrontational, so that her canvases have the mellow splendor of a beloved 1960s concert poster that's been hanging in the sun. (They also remind me of the printmaker Corita Kent's winsome hand with blocks of bold color.) The action is very much in the surface, which means that even a small amount of visible painterly texture -- or just placing one layer of shapes like a stencil over another -- produces a tremendous increase in the sense of depth.
In "Wrong Number," a small canvas on which two tulips emerge on either side of a small lavender sun, a thin layer of white sitting over a block of teal looks formidably complex. "Nothing Fixed" is full size, but feels more compact; circles, flowers and stripes, peering out through a butterfly-shaped grille of muddy, grade-school orange, feel eager but just out of reach. Sometimes the rough, intuitive quality of Brady's paintings can come across as a little hasty and undercooked -- but when they work, they're wonderful. WILL HEINRICH
Marian Zazeela
Through May 11. Artists Space, 11 Cortland Alley, Manhattan; 212-226-3970, artistsspace.org.
Marian Zazeela died on March 28 at age 83. A central figure of the New York avant-garde since the 1960s, Zazeela worked with light, paint and sound, often in collaboration with her husband, the minimalist composer La Monte Young. By coincidence (or resonance), a show at Artists Space called "Dream Lines" provides a rare concentrated view of her delicate and deep abstract calligraphy.
Moving clockwise around the gallery, you can see her technique grow. In pieces from 1962 and 1963, blocks of flared squiggles recall the holy pictorial lettering of Islam, ornamental strokes molded into bold shapes and replete with magnetic detail. The early drawings have the casual flair of studies. Pencil sketches underpin the compositions. One example, a rectangular congregation of serpentine blots, is inked on a paper towel.
By the late 1960s (one imagines, with devotional practice), Zazeela's marks are so saturated and clean that they don't feel drawn so much as placed. The lines curl into dense molars and concise arabesques, like visual mantras, repeated to form airy mandalas. The most seductive pieces include designs in colored ink; one square constellation of ruffled lines reminiscent of a Gothic chapel's floor plan steps from indigo to yellow. In another, rings of unerring green curls accent a hot pink page.
In 1963, Zazeela and Young moved into a TriBeCa apartment two blocks from Artists Space. On the third floor of their building is a 1993 iteration of their "Dream House," a public installation rigged with lavender light and a deep, droning raga -- a total calligraphy. TRAVIS DIEHL
Christopher Wool
Through July 31. 101 Greenwich Street (entrance on Rector Street), Manhattan; seestoprun.com.
The dilapidated 19th-floor office space hosting Christopher Wool's recent sculptures and paintings could not be more simpatico with them. In its state of abandoned tear-down, the venue offers melodious visual rhymes: electrical cords dangling from the ceiling ape Wool's snarls of found-wire sculpture; crumbling plaster mirrors the attitudinal blotches of his oils and inks. Scrawls of crude graffiti or quickly penciled notes left by workmen emulate the tendril-like lines dragged through Wool's globular masses of spray paint. The space is a horseshoe-shaped echo of Wool's work -- raw, agitated -- and the restless elegance he wrenches from a feeling of decay.
Wool said he started to think about how environment affects the experience of looking at art when he began splitting his time between New York and Marfa, in West Texas. Photographic series he made there, like "Westtexaspsychosculpture," depict forlorn whorls of fencing-wire debris that look like uncanny mimics of Wool's own writhing scribbles, and which inspired scaled-up versions cast in bronze. (The Marfa landscape is fertile ground for New York artists. Rauschenberg made his scrap metal assemblages after witnessing the oil-ruined landscape of 1980s Texas, what he called "souvenirs without nostalgia," a designation that's appropriate here, too.)
Place has always seeped into Wool's work. His photographs of the grime and trash-strewn streets of the Lower East Side in the 1990s -- compiled as "East Broadway Breakdown" -- aren't included here, but "Incident on 9th Street" (1997), of his own burned-out studio, are. The chaos of those scenes repeat here, the wraparound floor plan and endless windows letting the city permeate the work, just as it did in their making. MAX LAKIN

Up on the Roof, and All Over: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When the Kosovar artist Petrit Halilaj received an invitation for his biggest project ever in the United States, he knew just where to go: back to school.
For "Abetare," his spare, smart, absolutely delightful sculptural installation on the roof of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Halilaj, who is 38, traveled to elementary schools across southeastern Europe, documenting the doodles that generations of schoolchildren left on their desks and walls. (The project's title refers to the Albanian-language ABC book from which Halilaj learned the alphabet.) Those children's drawings from the Balkans formed the templates for the sprightly, sometimes bawdy bronze and steel sculptures that now garland the skyline of New York -- large ones, but also flowers, birds and graffiti that nestle in the topiaries, and hide behind the cocktail bar.
Halilaj was born in 1986 in Kosterrc, a small village outside the town of Runik. (At Art Basel one year he answered that perpetual question, Where are you from?, by dumping 60 tons of Kosterrc soil in the white cube of the art fair.) His own school days took place amid the most horrific fighting in Europe between World War II and the present war in Ukraine. Serbian forces burned down the Halilaj family home in 1999, at the height of the Kosovo war, one of the most brutal chapters of a decade-long nightmare of ethnic and religious conflicts in the Balkans. The family fled to Albania, where psychologists in a refugee camp encouraged the boy to draw. War reporters at the time chronicled an ambidextrous child prodigy, drawing chickens and peacocks with both hands.
Halilaj now lives in Berlin, but in both art and life he remains deeply engaged with Kosovo, which became independent in 2008 and where Halilaj is advising the culture ministry on the creation of a museum of contemporary art. (He figures among an exciting generation of artists from Europe's youngest country, including Flaka Haliti, Alban Muja, and Doruntina Kastrati, the last of whom just won a prize at the Venice Biennale.) And for a decade now I've been captivated by Halilaj's art, which pirouettes around questions of nationality, family and sexuality through a dense register of symbols -- especially birds, whose wings and claws appear everywhere from the surface of Balkan antiquities to the fuselage of a Boeing 737.
In two conversations, which have been condensed and edited, he and I spoke about the trauma of displacement, the magic of flight, and the universal language of schoolchildren's scribbling. While we were on the Met roof one morning he pointed out his little sculpture of a dove, high up in the sky. A pigeon -- an echt New Yorker -- had touched down next to Halilaj's bronze bird, and was making friends with its Balkan counterpart.
The project you've done for the Met roof continues one that began more than a decade ago, when you went back to your elementary school in Kosovo. What was it like, returning to the village you had to flee as a child?
In 2010 I went back to Runik for a holiday. My old school -- which had actually survived the war -- was being torn down to build a new one. [The Serbian army] had burned 99 percent of the town, this was one of the few buildings that remained, and still it was going to be replaced by new, cheap construction! And while I was at the school all these kids showed up. Some were teenagers, but others were very little, maybe 8, 9: little devils. A classic small-town crowd of naughty kids. I loved them.
Some of them knew me, that I'm an artist, and they were like, "You have to go in. "We entered, and I started filming. They started doing everything you are not supposed to do in a school -- just out-of-control fun.
These kids would have been born after 2000, after the war.
Exactly. They started painting on top of pictures of national heroes and poets, which, honestly, I would have never had the courage to do when I was a kid.
Then one of the kids took me into a classroom. And then I see the pile of these green school desks there since before the war. The desks were older than me. And this kid says to me, "Come see the drawings," because there is everything there. These desks contain 40 years of unconscious, crazy secrets. There's this encyclopedic aspect, these layers of generations. But you also see how local and global these things are, and also how funny.
I was just so touched by the language of drawing, and in a moment I saw another loss -- this time not from the war, but from the postwar craziness, wanting everything new. I asked the principal if I could save at least one classroom of desks. He said, "Yes, if you finance new desks." We made a deal. I hope he used the money to really buy them ...
You exhibited the desks from your hometown in a show in Cologne in 2015. Why did you go further, all around the Balkans, for the Met project?
It was a personal journey. I started three years ago, going to Kukes, in Albania, where I was a refugee. Then to Rozaje, in Montenegro, where we used to go on holidays before the war. Very, very, very small towns. I actually went to all the countries of ex-Yugoslavia, except Serbia, where I had friends send me images.
What I was amazed by, as I was going to the schools, was to feel so connected everywhere. For me, these drawings are a language that I just get. I had experts in education, or from museums, or even local artists, who accompanied me everywhere. Because otherwise it's hard to convince a school superintendent that you aren't a maniac. "Can I enter your classrooms to see the drawings of kids?" [Laughs] You have to really take time and build trust.
Some sculptures on the Met roof clearly refer to the Balkans. There's one with the letters "KFOR," a reference to the NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo. But there are also birds and stars, and Lionel Messi, and the Chanel logo, and then the same naughty drawings of body parts you could find on a school desk in America.
It's a really funny way of seeing history, through all these politically incorrect drawings. But I love the queerness in them, these secrets. They are codes. You can see the euro symbol screwing Yugoslavia ...
One little queer joke I caught up here on the roof is the sculpture that spells out "IDGAF" -- which stands for "I don't give a [expletive]," but is also a song by the unofficial president of Kosovo, Dua Lipa .
[Laughs] It's kind of a tribute to her, but it's also a little celebration of new possibilities. Both locally in Kosovo, or regionally, there is a chance for new generations to really question all these static historical, nationalist narratives that are so hard to move.
Tell me about why birds have such a notable place in your work. For your 2017-18 New Museum show, you translated antiquities from your hometown, many of which are now in museums in Serbia, into birdlike figures with spindly claws. There were giant brass bird claws in your show in Madrid, and a performer dressed as a white raven.
The birds and the chickens always bring me back to the Albanian ABC book, the Abetare. In the lesson for the letter P, there is a boy named Petrit. "Pulat e Petritit." Petrit and the chickens. So imagine, when you are little, and people ask you, "What's your name?" I would say "Petrit," and they would say, "Ah, Petrit with the chickens!" I didn't get it for years. Why am I Petrit with the chickens?! I just knew we had chickens in our garden ...
Later on, I understood that all these adults went through this Abetare and learned this lesson.
Language politics were such a flashpoint in the wars of the 1990s.
Students were allowed to learn in Albanian until 1989, with the ending of autonomy. After that it's this story of hidden classrooms, hidden universities. The school became a place of discussion, where we could see what was going to happen. My Abetare was burned when they burned the house in '99.
In shows before this one you've incorporated your own childhood drawings of birds, and also flowers. Is there something that links those redeployments of your drawings as a refugee with the doodles you found for the Met project?
Questioning adulthood, or questioning established canons by going back to a part of childhood is the way to understand the world around me that scares me the least. Going through the schools and the desks, there was a way to build a counternarrative: a network of symbols and alphabets and drawings that come to the Metropolitan Museum and form a kind of joint landscape.
Two years ago you did a wonderful project on the roof of the Grand Hotel in Pristina, Kosovo's capital. Once it was a five-star hotel; and as it declined through the war years, the stars on its roof sign were taken down one by one. You restored the stars, added dozens of new ones, and replaced the sign "Grand Hotel" with a phrase from a Kosovar child: "When the sun goes away we paint the sky."
This is a work that I ended up donating to the city, to the people of Pristina. We're talking about, literally, the hotel where Tito was coming to sleep. You can still sense this glamour that was once there. I mean, you had this fantastic article in The New York Times about it ...
The then-president of Kosovo told our reporter, "I don't think it is the worst hotel in the world, but that is because the world is very big."
And I had this idea of coming back to Kosovo and lighting it back up. Making something that is rotten into a 28-star hotel. Poetically, you can dream of something bigger than the hotels in Dubai, you know?
But to me the stars against the blue Pristina sky were also the stars of the flag of the European Union. The installation is just as much about Kosovo's still incomplete recognition as an independent European state.
It was about bringing in a different language that we hardly see in public spaces. And also about seeing sculpturally a fallen ideology in these fallen stars. In Yugoslavian times, there was a whole generation of people who were so proud of this hotel, and they had no money to enter.
You have these two rooftop projects, in Pristina and in New York, both rooted in the voices of children. And what interests me most is how these children's voices, even as they cement a claim to Kosovo's independence, also escape the nationalist traps of so much artistic advocacy.
At the Met there is an equilibrium. Maybe there are some nationalist symbols. But then you have a big heart. You have "Michael Jackson" written on the walls in Albania. You have group agendas, but also personal things. I felt like an archaeologist, discovering how people are so much more interconnected, more global, more human, than the national politics that dominate this area of Europe. And to me, that is really good news.

Supplement Stores Angle To Tap Into Ozempic Boom: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: GNC and the Vitamin Shoppe are redesigning displays and taking other steps to appeal to people who are taking or are interested in drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy.
As diabetes and weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy took off in the last few years, many people turned away from established diet and nutrition products.
Now, two retailers that specialize in nutritional supplements -- GNC and the Vitamin Shoppe -- are trying new approaches to win over people who are taking those drugs or who are interested in them.
GNC is dedicating a wall of supplements in its more than 2,300 stores to products that it believes will appeal to people on Ozempic, which contains the compound semaglutide, and other drugs that are known as GLP-1 medicines. The chain is also training workers to help customers assess which substances could help them manage common side effects of those prescription drugs.
Michael Costello, chief executive of GNC, said his company saw a "big opening" in helping individuals taking such drugs for weight loss.
"As we were looking at the trends with folks, where people are going, Ozempic and obviously Wegovy and other GLP-1s started blowing up," Mr. Costello said in an interview. "We saw there were significant side effects for a lot of those drugs."
It's not clear exactly how many Americans are taking Ozempic and similar drugs for weight loss, but Mr. Costello referred to a study from Goldman Sachs that estimates up to 70 million Americans will have tried the medicines by 2028.
GNC thinks it can expand its weight-management category through this push. Currently, less than 10 percent of GNC's business comes from its weight-management products, but recently, it said, sales in the category have grown more than 20 percent.
Retailers, food and other companies are all trying to figure out how Ozempic and similar drugs will hurt or help their businesses and what, if anything, they should be doing in response.
In October, Walmart, which has a sizable pharmacy business, said it had seen that people taking GLP-1 drugs bought slightly less food than other customers. The month before, an executive at Nestlé, the world's largest food company, expressed optimism about consumers turning to its Lean Cuisine meals, which is "exactly what you'd end up eating on these kind of drugs." And the fitness club chains Life Time Fitness and Equinox are offering training programs tailored to people on the medications.
GNC executives said they had assembled more than 20 products that could be used to treat common side effects like occasional fatigue, nutrient deficiency, reduced bone density and loss of muscle mass. It was already selling some of these products, but others are new to the retailer. The supplements include women's once-daily multivitamins, ginger root capsules and a chocolate lean shake. On the wall, signs list side effects alongside shelves of supplements that can alleviate them.
None of the supplements that GNC has in its reconfigured store were specifically made for or clinically tested on users of the new weight-loss drugs. Medical experts say most people can get all the nutrients they need from a well-balanced diet. In addition, experts say some supplements may not be effective and could cause their own side effects.
"Most patients will not need any supplements," said Dr. Maria Daniela Hurtado Andrade, an assistant professor at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla., whose research focuses on reducing obesity. She also treats patients who take GLP-1 medications.
Executives at the retail chains said they had curated the assortment in their displays after consulting external doctors, toxicologists, nutritionists and other professionals.
"All recommendations GNC is making for GLP-1 support align with the scientific substantiation, outcome of our consultations with doctors and review of credentialed professionals' positions on this topic," Rachel Jones, GNC's chief product innovation and science officer, said in a statement.
Some retailers have gone a step further. The Vitamin Shoppe has teamed up with WellSync, a telehealth company that fulfills prescriptions of GLP-1 medications. It is the first time the Vitamin Shoppe, which started in 1977, has worked with another business to offer customers a pharmaceutical option -- a sign of how seriously retail executives are taking Ozempic and its kin.
"I think there's no question that we have seen people that have said, 'Hey, if this isn't something you offer, I'm going to look elsewhere,"' Lee Wright, chief executive of the Vitamin Shoppe, said in an interview.
In a Vitamin Shoppe survey of more than 1,500 customers, 40 percent of the respondents said they would be "extremely" or "very likely" to use a telehealth service that the retail chain offered. Mr. Wright said learning that some employees in his stores were already on GLP-1 drugs had helped persuade him to work with WellSync.
The Vitamin Shoppe is keeping an arm's-length distance from the evaluation and prescription process, which involves an online questionnaire of medical history and goals and in some cases a live video interview with a licensed medical provider. (One of the questions is about body mass index.) WellSync manages that process, including working with clinicians. The companies have created a subscription service called Whole Health Rx, which starts at $ 219.
To bring people back to the chain, the Vitamin Shoppe offers people who subscribe a $ 25 voucher for use in its stores or on its website.
Similar to GNC, the Vitamin Shoppe is highlighting products like protein powders at its locations to attract people on Ozempic or similar drugs. By early May, Vitamin Shoppe and its sister brand, Super Supplements, will have displays in all 700 stores advertising its telehealth partnership and providing a QR code that directs consumers to the telehealth portal.
The market for supplements related to GLP-1 is pretty new. There have not been any significant trials testing the effectiveness of such products in easing the discomforts that come with using the drugs. And some doctors say many of the common side effects from weight-loss medicines can be easily managed or diminish over time, reducing the need for long-term use of supplements.
For example, Dr. Hurtado Andrade said, instead of recommending probiotic supplements, which have live micro-organisms like bacteria, she encourages her patients to eat food that contains those micro-organisms, like yogurt or kefir. After a detailed assessment, she has, in some cases, recommended protein shakes, powders and supplements to patients who aren't consuming enough protein, she said.
"I think having that medical supervision is extremely important because we can truly mitigate, or decrease the incidence of, severe side effects that I believe could happen if patients were not closely followed," Dr. Hurtado Andrade said.
GNC and Vitamin Shoppe executives said their workers -- whom they refer to as health enthusiasts or coaches -- weren't standing in for medical professionals. The executives also said the companies' approaches and strategies had been devised in consultation with staff nutritionists.
"We don't want our health enthusiasts to try and act," Mr. Wright at the Vitamin Shoppe said. "They're not doctors. They're not trying to give out any medical advice whatsoever."
GNC's Mr. Costello said his workers were trained to show empathy for the challenges. To that end, he has asked retail workers to watch Oprah Winfrey's recent special on Ozempic. The company has also taught them to ask "lifestyle questions" before pointing out supplements, like "What are your goals?" and "What are you currently doing to achieve your goals?"
That's all fine and good, Dr. Hurtado Andrade said, but she worries that retail workers are not as well informed as medical professionals about how to interpret and address symptoms. That requires knowing what questions should be asked, something that trained health practitioners and providers are trained to do, she said.
"I don't think a retailer is going to have the capability of thinking of the questions that need to be asked in order to narrow that differential and understand what the diarrhea or any other side effect is related to," she said.
Those concerns, however, are unlikely to stop retailers and the makers of supplements from diving deeper into what many analysts believe is going to be a fast-growing market.
Four years ago, before Ozempic had become a blockbuster drug, Supergut, a Los Angeles-based company, started selling prebiotic supplements, which feed micro-organisms in the gut. It marketed these products, like shakes and snack bars, in part as a way to help people control their blood sugar level.
Two years ago, Supergut began highlighting the potential benefits of its products for gut health and devoted a section on its website to GLP-1 drugs.
"This is the way that we're going to connect to the consumer consciousness," Marc Washington, chief executive of Supergut, said. "We're super relevant for this time and for this Ozempic era," he added.
In the past six months, sales have quadrupled, he said. GNC is stocking Supergut on its shelves in the GLP-1 section of its stores, the first time the brand is being sold in a national chain. Mr. Washington said he was talking to other national retailers, too.

Full text: Beau Dick
Through May 11. Andrew Kreps Gallery, 22 Cortlandt Alley & 394 Broadway, Manhattan; 212-741-8849, andrewkreps.com.
Not many people have the balance of Beau Dick (1955-2017). An activist and artist, he was a devotee of the wealth-redistributing feast known as the potlatch, which he called "the best form of resistance we have" against Western capitalism. He made masks for ceremonial dances within his Kwakwaka'wakw community in Pacific Northwest Canada and restored the practice, long discouraged by Western anthropologists, of burning them after use.
But he also sent his masks out into the gallery system, and the 23 examples now at Andrew Kreps, made between 1979 and 2016, are one of the most beautiful exhibits I've ever seen. As is often the case with ritual implements, Dick's masks bring with them a sense of life, a vividness and allure, that conventional art works, made only to be bought and sold, can hardly compete with.
But they're equally stunning even if you pretend they're just sculptures. They stand for traditional characters, like the wild woman of the woods, but the artist's inspired carving makes them as supple, as particular and as expressive as living actors. Without being flashy about it, the masks' sharp lines and bright acrylic colors also illustrate Dick's awareness of all the other currents of 20th-century art.
In a mask titled "Wind," a white-painted face purses bright red lips, and its cheeks sink in with perfect anatomical fidelity. The eyeholes, one inch deep, are outlined in black, but their white inner surfaces, coming in and out of view as you move from side to side for a closer look, seem to be blinking.
Al Freeman
Through May 6. Venus Over Manhattan, 39 Great Jones Street, Manhattan; 212-980-0700, venusovermanhattan.com.
Through May 24. 56 Henry, 56 Henry Street, Manhattan; 646-858-0800, 56henry.nyc
Al Freeman makes satirical, Claes Oldenburg-style sculptures of beer cans, electrical cords and other lowly objects. She finds absurd photos on the internet to juxtapose with canonical paintings that happen to be similar. But I didn't realize until this double show of her drawings of book and album covers that she's basically a cartoonist.
A good drawing lets you see the world not just through someone else's eyes, but through her mind. And Freeman's mind, it turns out, is a homespun and jokey but curiously earnest place, where the well-known artists and writers of her parents' generation nestle together in comfortable free-for-all. Philip Roth's "Portnoy's Complaint," Joan Didion's "White Album," Roald Dahl's "The Twits" -- Freeman's drawings of their covers are all the same size, their edges are all a little wonky, their spines are rendered with comic-strip Cubism as stripes on the left. Sometimes Freeman's choice of a title -- e.g., Danielle Steel's "Daddy," or a tattered blue Bible -- seems to mean something special. Sometimes it offers the chance for her deft, charming line to "cover" someone else's art, like Andy Warhol's flowers, the blood vessels on the "Gray's Anatomy" textbook, or Quentin Blake's unforgettable illustration of the Twits.
But sometimes, as with a Japanese edition of Paul Simon's single "You Can Call Me Al," the only obvious significance of the subject is its very mundane specificity. It's a grain of human experience that artist and viewer, by means of the drawing, can share.
Meghan Brady
Through May 11. Mrs., 60-40 56th Drive, Maspeth, Queens; 347-841-6149, mrsgallery.com.
The prolific painter Meghan Brady's latest body of work fills two galleries, one in Maspeth, Queens, and one at Dunes Gallery in Portland, Maine, a couple of hours from her home base in Camden. You may not get to both (I only made it to Maspeth), but in either you'll find striking, paper-cut-like patterns rendered in oil over acrylic in an alluring range of scales, from nearly pocket-size to over six feet tall.
Brady's distinctive, milky palette is bright but nonconfrontational, so that her canvases have the mellow splendor of a beloved 1960s concert poster that's been hanging in the sun. (They also remind me of the printmaker Corita Kent's winsome hand with blocks of bold color.) The action is very much in the surface, which means that even a small amount of visible painterly texture -- or just placing one layer of shapes like a stencil over another -- produces a tremendous increase in the sense of depth.
In "Wrong Number," a small canvas on which two tulips emerge on either side of a small lavender sun, a thin layer of white sitting over a block of teal looks formidably complex. "Nothing Fixed" is full size, but feels more compact; circles, flowers and stripes, peering out through a butterfly-shaped grille of muddy, grade-school orange, feel eager but just out of reach. Sometimes the rough, intuitive quality of Brady's paintings can come across as a little hasty and undercooked -- but when they work, they're wonderful.

More Old Chums, Trying to Live It Up: [Review]

Full text: Eddie Redmayne and Gayle Rankin star in a buzzy Broadway revival that rips the skin off the 1966 musical.
Just east of its marquee, the August Wilson Theater abuts an alley you probably didn't notice when last you were there, perhaps to see "Funny Girl," its previous tenant. Why would you? Where the trash goes is not usually part of the Broadway experience.
But it is for the latest revival of "Cabaret," which opened at the Wilson on Sunday. Audience members are herded into that alley, past the garbage, down some halls, up some stairs and through a fringed curtain to a dimly lit lounge. (There's a separate entrance for those with mobility issues.) Along the way, greeters offer free shots of cherry schnapps that taste, I'm reliably told, like cough syrup cut with paint thinner.
Too often I thought the same of the show itself.
But the show comes later. First, starting 75 minutes beforehand, you can experience the ambience of the various bars that constitute the so-called Kit Kat Club, branded in honor of the fictional Berlin cabaret where much of the musical takes place. Also meant to get you in the mood for a story set mostly in 1930, on the edge of economic and spiritual disaster, are some moody George Grosz-like paintings commissioned from Jonathan Lyndon Chase. (One is called "Dancing, Holiday Before Doom.") The $ 9 thimbleful of potato chips is presumably a nod to the period's hyperinflation.
This all seemed like throat clearing to me, as did the complete reconfiguration of the auditorium itself, which is now arranged like a large supper club or a small stadium. (The scenic, costume and theater design are the jaw-dropping work of Tom Scutt.) The only relevant purpose I can see for this conceptual doodling, however well carried out, is to give the fifth Broadway incarnation of the 1966 show a distinctive profile. It certainly does that.
The problem for me is that "Cabaret" has a distinctive profile already. The extreme one offered here frequently defaces it.
Let me quickly add that Rebecca Frecknall's production, first seen in London, has many fine and entertaining moments. Some feature its West End star Eddie Redmayne, as the macabre emcee of the Kit Kat Club (and quite likely your nightmares). Some come from its new New York cast, including Gayle Rankin (as the decadent would-be chanteuse Sally Bowles) and Bebe Neuwirth and Steven Skybell (dignified and wrenching as an older couple). Others arise from Frecknall's staging itself, which is spectacular when in additive mode, illuminating the classic score by John Kander and Fred Ebb, and the amazingly sturdy book by Joe Masteroff.
But too often a misguided attempt to resuscitate the show breaks its ribs.
The conception of Sally is especially alarming. As written -- and as introduced in the play and stories the musical is based on -- she is a creature of blithe insouciance if not talent, an English good-time gal flitting from brute to brute in Berlin while hoping to become a star. Her first number, "Don't Tell Mama," is a lively Charleston with winking lyrics ("You can tell my brother, that ain't grim/Cause if he squeals on me I'll squeal on him") that make the Kit Kat Club audience, and the Broadway one too, complicit in her naughtiness.
Instead, Frecknall gives us a Sally made up to look like she's recently been assaulted or released from an asylum, who dances like a wounded bird, stretches each syllable to the breaking point and shrieks the song instead of singing it. (Goodbye, Charleston; hello, dirge.) If Rankin doesn't sound good in the number, nor later in "Mein Herr," interpolated from the 1972 film, she's not trying to. Like the cough syrup-paint thinner concoction, she's meant to be taken medicinally and poisonously in this production, projecting instead of concealing Sally's turmoil.
That's inside-out. The point of Sally, and of "Cabaret" more generally, is to dramatize the danger of disengagement from reality, not to fetishize it.
The guts-first problem also distorts Redmayne's Emcee, but at least that character was always intended as allegorical. He is the host to anything, the amoral shape-shifter, becoming whatever he must to get by. Here, he begins as a kind of marionette in a leather skirt and tiny party hat, hiccupping his way through "Willkommen." Later he effectively incarnates himself as a creepy clown, an undead skeleton, Sally's twin and a glossy Nazi.
Having seen Frecknall's riveting production of "Sanctuary City," a play about undocumented immigrants by Martyna Majok, I'm not surprised that her "Cabaret" finds a surer footing in the "book" scenes. These are the ones that take place in the real Berlin, not the metaphorical one of the Kit Kat Club. She is extraordinarily good when she starts with the naturalistic surface of behavior, letting the mise en scène and the lighting (excellent, by Isabella Byrd) suggest the rest.
And naturalism is what you find at the boardinghouse run by Fräulein Schneider (Neuwirth), a woman who has learned to keep her nose down to keep safe. Her tenants include a Jewish fruiterer, Herr Schultz (Skybell); a prostitute, Fräulein Kost (Natascia Diaz); and Clifford Bradshaw (Ato Blankson-Wood), an American writer come to Berlin in search of inspiration. Soon Sally shows up to provide it, having talked her way into Cliff's life and bed despite being little more than a stranger. Also, despite Cliff's romantic ambivalence; over the years, the character has had his sexuality revamped more times than a clownfish.
The Schneider-Shultz romance is sweet and sad; neither character is called upon to shriek. And Rankin excels in Sally's scenes with Cliff, her wry, frank and hopeful personality back in place. The songs that emerge from the boardinghouse dramas are not ransacked as psychiatric case studies but are rather given room to let comment proceed naturally from real entertainment. Rankin's "Maybe This Time," with no slathered-on histrionics, is riveting. It turns out she can properly sing.
The interface between the naturalism and the expressionism does make for some weird moments: Herr Schultz, courtly in a topcoat, must hug Sally goodbye in her bra. But letting the styles mix also brings out the production's most haunting imagery. The intrusion of the Nazi threat into the story is especially well handled: first a gorgeously sung and thus chilling version of "Tomorrow Belongs to Me," then the swastika and then -- well, I don't want to give away how Frecknall stages the scene in which Schultz's fruit shop is vandalized.
That so many of these moments arise from faithful attention to the original material should be no surprise. "Cabaret" hasn't lasted this long for nothing. Created at the tail end of Broadway's Golden Age, it benefited from the tradition of meticulous craftsmanship that preceded it while anticipating the era of conceptual stagings that followed.
All this is baked into the book, and especially the score, which I trust I admire not merely because I worked on a Kander and Ebb show 40 years ago. That the lyrics rhyme perfectly is a given with Ebb; more important, they are always the right words to rhyme. (Listen, in the title song, for the widely spaced triplet of "room," "broom" and, uh-oh, "tomb.") And Kander's music, remixing period jazz, Kurt Weill and Broadway exuberance, never oversteps the milieu or outpaces the characters even as it pushes them toward their full and sometimes manic expression.
When this new "Cabaret" follows that template, it achieves more than the buzz of chic architecture and louche dancing. (The choreography is by Julia Cheng.) Seducing us and then repelling us -- in that order -- it dramatizes why we flock to such things in the first place, whether at the Kit Kat Club or the August Wilson Theater. We hope, at our risk, to forget that, outside, "life is disappointing," as the Emcee tells us. We want to unsee the trash.

Full text: Portraits go undercover in the new Metropolitan Museum show "Hidden Faces," about the practice of concealing artworks behind sliding panels and reverse-side paintings.
The Met's delightful show "Hidden Faces: Covered Portraits of the Renaissance" illuminates a curious trend in 15th- and 16th-century painting: the slow reveal. The works on view, originally concealed in special cases and behind sliding or reversible panels, gamify the experience of looking at portraiture; they have to be moved, before they can move us.
Of course, we can't actually handle these artworks, many of them on loan to the Met from European museums including the Courtauld in London and the Uffizi in Florence. But we can peer at them from double-sided glass cases and watch animations of faces emerging from sliding panels. The covers are marvelous works in their own right, with elaborate emblems and allegories that are themselves a form of representation.
The interactions between the different components can be quite playful, with a literary and theatrical flair. A mesmerizing portrait of a Florentine lady in a flowing sheer veil, attributed to the early-16th-century Italian painter Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, is accompanied by a decorative panel with the Latin inscription "To each his own mask" and a trompe l'oeil face covering to match.
Among the show's many examples of Netherlandish portraiture, a clever narrative unfolds through a double-sided work by Hans Süss von Kulmbach, a protégé of Albrecht Dürer. On the front is a bust-length image of a man who seems to be looking at the upper left corner of the painting -- or, perhaps, he is gazing up at the woman sitting in a window who appears when the panel is flipped.
The Renaissance practice of covering paintings was rooted in earlier religious traditions and liturgical rituals, a point made in the show by a work borrowed from the Cloisters: a private devotional shrine with wings that open to display images of a female donor and her husband next to Saint Catherine.
The catalog essay by Alison Manges Nogueira, the organizer of the exhibition and the curator of the Met's Robert Lehman Collection, goes deeper into history -- back to the second century and a curtained statue from the Temple of Zeus at Olympia. And, as Nogueira writes, artworks from antiquity to the present have also been concealed for a variety of secular motivations, prurience being the most obvious one. (Gustave Courbet's famous close-up of female genitalia, "Origin of the World," was originally concealed by a sliding shutter.)

Yet another reason, mentioned in the catalog, was suggested by the French Baroque painter Nicolas Poussin, in a 1648 letter to the collector Paul Fréart de Chantelou: "The intention of covering your paintings is excellent, and to make them visible one by one will mean we do not grow tired, for seeing them all at the same time fills the senses too much at once." The idea was to create a measured, controlled aesthetic experience, lest the viewer succumb to the psychosomatic disorder we know today as Stendhal Syndrome.
The show interprets "cover" somewhat liberally, including multisided works alongside those incorporating sleeves and containers. But the concept is the same: that a painted portrait could be enriched and enlivened by a secretive and complementary image, often one that spoke to the character or lineage of the subject.
A double-sided painting from the workshop of Rogier van der Weyden depicts a serious man with a furrowed brow and a hand resting on an open book; he is thought to be the Burgundian cleric Guillaume Fillastre. On its reverse side is an arrestingly naturalistic rendering of a holly branch with light glinting off its spiky leaves. An inscription at the top of the panel reads, "I hate what bites" -- a cryptic motto that has been interpreted as a gesture of self-defense against intellectual critics.
The exhibition itself is double-sided, roughly split between the Netherlands and Italy. And it has a kind of symmetry, in that both halves contain many works commissioned from merchants and bankers -- middle-aged men who were looking to solidify their social status and family lineage. When women appear, it is in the role of wife, daughter or paramour. (The Florentine lady with the mask, for instance, is thought to be a member of the city's powerful Antinori family.)
Heinrich zum Jungen, a Frankfurt trader, was a typical client; his portrait by an unidentified artist includes a coat of arms, painted in a matching palette of red and green, on its verso. It was painted the same year his father established a burial site for the family, and comes across as a transparent but nonetheless poignant bid for legacy.
Sending a different message -- "you can't take it with you" -- is a painting from the circle of Jacometto Veneziano, a Venetian artist credited with introducing the Netherlandish style of portraiture to Northern Italy. Its rosy-cheeked female subject wears a loosely draped yellow scarf that identifies her, per city law of the time, as a prostitute. An inscription in Latin on the reverse, made to look as if it had been carved into marble, translates as: "Satisfy the soul with delights, for after death there is no pleasure."
This work is one of many that play with illusionistic surfaces. One of the exhibition's standouts is Jacometto's portrait of a boy, tender yet almost Dürer-esque in its precision, with a flip side painted to look like porphyry (a precious stone with an imperial, funereal history). Covers such as this associated portrait subjects and their families with substance and permanence.
In a gallery of "capsule portraits," or small-scale, portable keepsakes, covers are more of a practical necessity than a poetic device. Images of loved ones (the mistress of an Elector of Saxony) and leaders (the Protestant reformer Martin Luther) nestle in boxes, cases and bags, and in one piece a spectacularly luxurious watch, for wearability and ease of transport.
It would have been interesting to see the show extend from portraits with removable lids and twin faces to encompass the many artworks in the Met's collection that have curtains and veils painted into the scene. For that, you'll have to head upstairs to the Titians and Vermeers in the European Paintings galleries.
Still, the discrete physical barriers in "Hidden Faces" are mysterious, compelling intermediaries. The cover, here, is a gateway between the sacred and the secular, or between this life and the next. It seems to say that portraiture exists in a magical realm that remains off-limits to mortals, even as the artwork itself invites us to manipulate a physical object. And in a matter-of-fact way, it reminds us that art is precious and extremely vulnerable.

Recycling Of Plastic Falls Short Of Promise: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: By 2025, Nestle promises not to use any plastic in its products that isn't recyclable. By that same year, L'Oreal says all of its packaging will be "refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable."
And by 2030, Procter & Gamble pledges that it will halve its use of virgin plastic resin made from petroleum.
To get there, these companies and others are promoting a new generation of recycling plants, called "advanced" or "chemical" recycling, that promise to recycle many more products than can be recycled today.
So far, advanced recycling is struggling to deliver on its promise. Nevertheless, the new technology is being hailed by the plastics industry as a solution to an exploding global waste problem.
The traditional approach to recycling is to simply grind up and melt plastic waste. The new, advanced-recycling operators say they can break down the plastic much further, into more basic molecular building blocks, and transform it into new plastic.
PureCycle Technologies, a company that features prominently in Nestlé, L'Oréal, and Procter & Gamble's plastics commitments, runs one such facility, a $ 500 million plant in Ironton, Ohio. The plant was originally to start operating in 2020, with the capacity to process as much as 182 tons of discarded polypropylene, a hard-to-recycle plastic used widely in single-use cups, yogurt tubs, coffee pods and clothing fibers, every day.
But PureCycle's recent months have instead been filled with setbacks: technical issues at the plant, shareholder lawsuits, questions over the technology and a startling report from contrarian investors who make money when a stock price falls. They said that they had flown a drone over the facility that showed that the plant was far from being able to make much new plastic.
PureCycle, based in Orlando, Fla., said it remained on track. "We're ramping up production," its chief executive, Dustin Olson, said during a recent tour of the plant, a constellation of pipes, storage tanks and cooling towers in Ironton, near the Ohio River. "We believe in this technology. We've seen it work," he said. "We're making leaps and bounds."
Nestlé, Procter & Gamble and L'Oréal have also expressed confidence in PureCycle. L'Oréal said PureCycle was one of many partners developing a range of recycling technologies. P.&G. said it hoped to use the recycled plastic for "numerous packaging applications as they scale up production." Nestlé didn't respond to requests for comment, but has said it is collaborating with PureCycle on "groundbreaking recycling technologies."
PureCycle's woes are emblematic of broad trouble faced by a new generation of recycling plants that have struggled to keep up with the growing tide of global plastic production, which scientists say could almost quadruple by midcentury.
A chemical-recycling facility in Tigard, Ore., a joint venture between Agilyx and Americas Styrenics, is in the process of shutting down after millions of dollars in losses. A plant in Ashley, Ind., that had aimed to recycle 100,000 tons of plastic a year by 2021 had processed only 2,000 tons in total as of late 2023, after fires, oil spills and worker safety complaints.
At the same time, many of the new generation of recycling facilities are turning plastic into fuel, something the Environmental Protection Agency doesn't consider to be recycling, though industry groups say some of that fuel can be turned into new plastic.
Overall, the advanced recycling plants are struggling to make a dent in the roughly 36 million tons of plastic Americans discard each year, which is more than any other country. Even if the 10 remaining chemical-recycling plants in America were to operate at full capacity, they would together process some 456,000 tons of plastic waste, according to a recent tally by Beyond Plastics, a nonprofit group that advocates stricter controls on plastics production. That's perhaps enough to raise the plastic recycling rate -- which has languished below 10 percent for decades -- by a single percentage point.
For households, that has meant that much of the plastic they put out for recycling doesn't get recycled at all, but ends up in landfills. Figuring out which plastics are recyclable and which aren't has turned into, essentially, a guessing game. That confusion has led to a stream of non-recyclable trash contaminating the recycling process, gumming up the system.
"The industry is trying to say they have a solution," said Terrence J. Collins, a professor of chemistry and sustainability science at Carnegie Mellon University. "It's a non-solution."
'Molecular washing machine'
It was a long-awaited day last June at PureCycle's Ironton facility: The company had just produced its first batch of what it describes as "ultra-pure" recycled polypropylene pellets.
That milestone came several years late and with more than $ 350 million in cost overruns. Still, the company appeared to have finally made it. "Nobody else can do this," Jeff Kramer, the plant manager, told a local news crew.
PureCycle had done it by licensing a game-changing method -- developed by Procter & Gamble researchers in the mid-2010s, but unproven at scale -- that uses solvent to dissolve and purify the plastic to make it new again. "It's like a molecular washing machine," Mr. Olson said.
There's a reason Procter & Gamble, Nestlé and L'Oréal, some of the world's biggest users of plastic, are excited about the technology. Many of their products are made from polypropylene, a plastic that they transform into a plethora of products using dyes and fillers. P.&G. has said it uses more polypropylene than any other plastic, more than a half-million tons a year.
But those additives make recycling polypropylene more difficult.
The E.P.A. estimates that 2.7 percent of polypropylene packaging is reprocessed. But PureCycle was promising to take any polypropylene -- disposable beer cups, car bumpers, even campaign signs -- and remove the colors, odors, and contaminants to transform it into new plastic.
Soon after the June milestone, trouble hit.
On Sept. 13, PureCycle disclosed that its plant had suffered a power failure the previous month that had halted operations and caused a vital seal to fail. That meant the company would be unable to meet key milestones, it told lenders.
Then in November, Bleecker Street Research -- a New York-based short-seller, an investment strategy that involves betting that a company's stock price will fall -- published a report asserting that the white pellets that had rolled off PureCycle's line in June weren't recycled from plastic waste. The short-sellers instead claimed instead that the company had simply run virgin polypropylene through the system as part of a demonstration run.
Mr. Olsen said PureCycle hadn't used consumer waste in the June 2023 run, but it hadn't used virgin plastic, either. Instead it had used scrap known as "post industrial," which is what's left over from the manufacturing process and would otherwise go to a landfill, he said.
Bleecker Street also said it had flown heat-sensing drones over the facility and said it found few signs of commercial-scale activity. The firm also raised questions about the solvent PureCycle was using to break down the plastic, calling it "a nightmare concoction" that was difficult to manage.
PureCycle is now being sued by other investors who accuse the company of making false statements and misleading investors about its setbacks.
Mr. Olson declined to describe the solvent. Regulatory filings reviewed by The New York Times indicate that it is butane, a highly flammable gas, stored under pressure. The company's filing described the risks of explosion, citing a "worst case scenario" that could cause second-degree burns a half-mile away, and said that to mitigate the risk the plant was equipped with sprinklers, gas detectors and alarms.
Chasing the 'circular economy'
It isn't unusual, of course, for any new technology or facility to experience hiccups. The plastics industry says these projects, once they get going, will bring the world closer to a "circular" economy, where things are reused again and again.
Plastics-industry lobbying groups are promoting chemical recycling. At a hearing in New York late last year, industry lobbyists pointed to the promise of advanced recycling in opposing a packaging-reduction bill that would eventually mandate a 50 percent reduction in plastic packaging. And at negotiations for a global plastics treaty, lobby groups are urging nations to consider expanding chemical recycling instead of taking steps like restricting plastic production or banning plastic bags.
A spokeswoman for the American Chemistry Council, which represents plastics makers as well as oil and gas companies that produce the building blocks of plastic, said that chemical recycling potentially "complements mechanical recycling, taking the harder-to-recycle plastics that mechanical often cannot."
Environmental groups say the companies are using a timeworn strategy of promoting recycling as a way to justify selling more plastic, even though the new recycling technology isn't ready for prime time. Meanwhile, they say, plastic waste chokes rivers and streams, piles up in landfills or is exported.
"These large consumer brand companies, they're out over their skis," said Judith Enck, the president of Beyond Plastics and a former regional E.P.A. administrator. "Look behind the curtain, and these facilities aren't operating at scale, and they aren't environmentally sustainable," she said.
The better solution, she said, would be, "We need to make less plastic."
Touring the plant
Mr. Olsen recently strolled through a cavernous warehouse at PureCycle's Ironton site, built at a former Dow Chemical plant. Since January, he said, PureCycle has been processing mainly consumer plastic waste and has produced about 1.3 million pounds of recycled polypropylene, or about 1 percent of its annual production target.
"This is a bag that would hold dog food," he said, pointing to a bale of woven plastic bags. "And these are fruit carts that you'd see in street markets. We can recycle all of that, which is pretty cool."
The plant was dealing with a faulty valve discovered the day before, so no pellets were rolling off the line. Mr. Olson pulled out a cellphone to show a photo of a valve with a dark line ringing its interior. "It's not supposed to look like that," he said.
The company later sent video of Mr. Olson next to white pellets once again streaming out of its production line.
PureCycle says every kilogram of polypropylene it recycles emits about 1.54 kilograms of planet-warming carbon dioxide. That's on par with a commonly used industry measure of emissions for virgin polypropylene. PureCycle said that it was improving on that measure.
Nestlé, L'Oréal and Procter & Gamble continue to say they're optimistic about the technology. In November, Nestlé said it had invested in a British company that would more easily separate out polypropylene from other plastic waste.
It was "just one of the many steps we are taking on our journey to ensure our packaging doesn't end up as waste," the company said.

Full text: Snacking for the Masters, a benefit for a culinary careers program and a fond farewell to this column.
Add cassava to that wardrobe of tortillas. A new line, Coyotas, is an alternative to flour tortillas. It uses gluten-free organic cassava flour and organic coconut oil with only water and salt. The result behaves like flour tortillas, holds up well with fillings and comes in three sizes: small for tacos, medium for larger tacos and quesadillas, and large for burritos and other wraps. The company, based in San Diego, was started by Janet Flores Pavlovich, a native of Hermosillo in Sonora, in Northern Mexico, where the flour tortilla reigns. She learned to make them in her hometown and while she was at it, innovated by using cassava flour. And in one of those felicitous culinary accidents like the Toll House cookie, wound up with a gluten-free product. There are 12 in a pack of small, eight of medium and six of large; three packs for $ 37.50.

A Gift Basket for Caper Obsessives
I'm not sure I would have given my mother a gift basket of herbs and capers from the volcanic Sicilian island of Pantelleria for Mother's Day. But for me? Any time. John A. Savittieri, a furniture designer from Maplewood, N.J., was exploring his family's roots on the island when he became hooked on capers, the savory buds of the capparis spinosa flower that thrive there. Fast forward a year or so, he's now importing them, tiny or piccoli ones, packed in Trapani sea salt (rinse it off), along with larger caper berries, fragrant dried herbs and the salt, all starting at $ 4.50. The gift basket, $ 132.50, comes with a ceramic caper-keeper box shaped like the dammuso houses of the island.

A Twist on a Neapolitan Easter Specialty
A new take on Pastiera di Grano, a Neapolitan Easter specialty that legend says was created by a nun, can grace your holiday table this year. Kara Blitz, the new pastry chef at Lincoln Ristorante in Lincoln Center, makes a lovely version, more delicate than some, incorporating tiny wheat berries in the orange-scented custard filling made with buffalo ricotta, mascarpone and orange confit. Tradition has it that the nun wanted to capture the orange fragrance from the convent gardens in her tart. Ms. Blitz bakes hers in a rectangle with a lattice top, enough to serve eight to 10. It's available, pre-ordered online, for pickup this week through Easter Sunday at the restaurant, $ 42.

A Benefit for Culinary Careers and Asylum Seekers
C-Cap, Careers through Culinary Arts, the nonprofit that prepares middle and high school students with limited resources for work in food service, has added its reach to include adult asylum seekers holding work permits. The pilot program, with a grant of $ 360,178 from the office of Gov. Kathy Hochul, has just graduated nine students from Central and South America, at its training center in Francis Lewis High School in Queens, six of whom have already secured jobs. The organization will hold a fund-raiser for this and its other programs Monday at Chelsea Piers, honoring Mary Attea and Jennifer Vitagliano of the Musket Room and Raf's with tastings by more than a dozen chefs.
C-Cap's National Benefit, from 5:45 p.m. (V.I.P.), Pier 60, Chelsea Piers, 23rd Street and West Street, $ 700 and up, ccapinc.org.
The Perfect Snacking for the Masters
The nosh of choice for the Super Bowl is wings. For the Masters, the first of four annual golf tournaments, it's pimento cheese, a specialty of the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Ga., where the competition is held. This year it runs from April 11 through 14, with three pre-tournament events starting April 8. For the first time, Goldbelly is selling a special Taste of the Masters package for munching, including the cheese. A package to serve 12 to 14, $ 179.95, also includes pork barbecue, egg salad, chocolate chip cookies and pecan-caramel popcorn.

Unilever Plans To Slash Jobs, And Spin Off Ben & Jerry's: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The consumer goods giant said the moves would make for a "simpler, more focused company" as consumers trade down to cheaper brands amid high inflation.
Unilever, the consumer goods giant, said on Tuesday that it would cut 7,500 jobs and spin off its ice cream unit, which includes Ben & Jerry's, to reduce costs and simplify its portfolio of brands.
The moves would make for "a simpler, more focused and higher performing Unilever," Ian Meakins, the London-based company's chair, said in a statement. The group's ice cream unit generated 7.9 billion euros ( $ 8.6 billion) in sales last year, or about 13 percent of the group's total.
The division is home to Ben & Jerry's, which Unilever acquired in 2000, along with brands like Cornetto, Magnum, Talenti and Wall's. The spinoff is expected to be completed by the end of 2025.
Hein Schumacher, who took over as Unilever's chief executive in July, announced a plan late last year to "drive growth and unlock potential," in part by focusing more attention on just 30 of the group's hundreds of brands.
On Tuesday, he said the job cuts and ice cream spinoff would "accelerate" the plan, saving nearly $ 870 million in costs over the next three years. The layoffs, of "predominantly office-based roles" around the world, amount to about 6 percent of Unilever's work force.
In early 2022, Nelson Peltz, one of Wall Street's most prominent activist investors, began building a stake in Unilever. Mr. Peltz, who is known for pushing companies to simplify their corporate structures, got a seat later that year on Unilever's board, where he remains.
After the proposed spinoff, Unilever's remaining units would include health and beauty brands like Dove soap, consumer goods like Surf detergent and food brands including Hellmann's mayonnaise.
Unilever rival Nestlé shifted many of its European ice cream brands to a joint venture with a private equity firm in 2016 and sold its U.S. brands, including Dreyer's and Häagen-Dazs, to the venture in 2019.
Unilever has struggled in recent years, with revenue growth propped up by steep price increases as sales volumes have declined. Squeezed by inflation, consumers have been turning instead to cheaper brands in many of Unilever's biggest categories, most notably less essential products like ice cream.
The ice cream division faced the highest input-cost inflation in Unilever's portfolio last year, the company said in an earnings report last month. It passed on some of those costs to consumers, prompting them to buy less or switch to cheaper brands, leading to a "disappointing year with declining market share and profitability," the company said.
"The company has tried accelerated cost-cutting for accelerated growth for at least a decade," analysts at Bernstein wrote in a research note. "This plan remains 'we will try harder' to execute the same plan, or hope over experience," they added. Unilever's shares rose about 3 percent on Tuesday, but have been roughly flat over the past year.
Ben & Jerry's, which has been run by an independent board since its takeover by Unilever, has not always sat comfortably in the portfolio of a staid multinational corporation. The founders of the Vermont-based brand are outspoken on hot-button social and political issues; in 2021, they said they would end sales in Israeli-occupied territories.
That led some U.S. pension funds to divest from Unilever and prompted a shareholder lawsuit. Ben & Jerry's sued Unilever in 2022 to stop it from selling distribution rights to a licensee in Israel. Unilever eventually sold the rights to its longstanding local partner there, which continues to sell the ice cream with slightly different branding.

The Billionaire's Giant Mealtime Gamble: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Dunn, Elizabeth G

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Marc Lore, the entrepreneur behind Diapers.com and Jet.com, would like to disrupt food delivery. But he really wants to build a brand that actually lasts.
When Marc Lore, the e-commerce billionaire, left his position as the chief executive of Walmart.com in 2021, he began to dabble in a variety of long-odds attempts to change the world. He backed a nuclear fusion start-up, and another designing flying taxis. Frustrated with the current state of capitalism, he embarked on plans to build, from scratch, a Bjarke Ingels-designed city of five million in the American West.
Recently, though, Mr. Lore has put all that aside to focus on an even bigger moonshot: solving dinner.
Mr. Lore's business ideas often begin with a widely felt consumer frustration and back into a solution. In the aughts, his company Diapers.com keyed in on the annoyance, for new parents, of having to constantly run out for more diapers; imagine if they could be delivered to your door? His latest scheme, a start-up called Wonder, exists to tackle food delivery, which Mr. Lore believes too often disappoints customers by arriving too slowly.
Wonder's opening salvo, in 2021, was flooding the New Jersey suburbs with hundreds of Mercedes Sprinter vans that could cook menus designed by celebrity chefs like Bobby Flay or José Andrés in customers' driveways. Demand for food delivery is most concentrated in cities, but Mr. Lore thought that the suburbs held plenty of untapped potential; a van-based strategy faced more challenges in crowded urban environments, which the company planned to work up to.
Initially, after founding the company, Mr. Lore (rhymes with story) was involved only as an adviser and investor. Then in late 2022, shortly after a $ 350 million capital raise brought Wonder's funding total to $ 800 million, he took over leadership of the company, installing himself as chief executive.
"This is once in a lifetime," Mr. Lore told me, with characteristic zeal. "This could be the Amazon of food and beverage."
On a recent Wednesday morning, Mr. Lore, 52, was huddled with his senior executive team at Wonder's research and development facility in Parsippany, N.J., preparing for a board meeting. It had been a busy 2023: The company started the year by abandoning the meals-on-wheels strategy -- the biggest problem, Mr. Lore said, was finding enough parking -- and began cooking food the old-fashioned way, in kitchens.
Wonder built 10 locations in and around New York City, from Park Slope to Chelsea to Westfield, N.J. It more than doubled the breadth of its food offerings, bought the meal kit company Blue Apron, secured a $ 100 million strategic investment from Nestlé, and signed a deal with Walmart to build Wonders in four of its stores. It had also been expanding a part of the business that provides food and technology to food service operations at venues like sporting arenas, hotels and airport lounges.
The vision that Mr. Lore is now selling to his investors calls for Wonder to not just maintain that furious pace of growth, but ramp it up. Mr. Lore is attempting to round up $ 500 million in additional capital, which he says is crucial to getting the company through the next two years, at which point he plans to have 100 locations open. He has $ 200 million personally invested in Wonder, with a plan to commit $ 100 million more.
Mr. Lore says he's targeting an initial public offering in three to five years, aiming for a valuation of $ 30 billion.
That plan is ambitious, to say the least. By way of comparison, it took Chipotle, the biggest restaurant industry success story in a generation, nearly 30 years to reach a $ 30 billion market cap. The salad chain Sweetgreen is hovering just over $ 2 billion. After its recent I.P.O., Cava, the Mediterranean fast casual brand with 300 locations, is valued around $ 7 billion.
Previous upstarts attempting to reinvent food delivery have fizzled or flopped. Mr. Lore seemed unfazed. "There's going to be a lot of failures," he said. "And then somebody's going to figure it out."
The 'Super-App' of Mealtime
Among the great many things there are to figure out at Wonder is how to describe to customers what it is. The business doesn't fit neatly into an existing food service category. "Delivery company" implies just an app and courier network, like Uber Eats or Grubhub, but Wonder makes all its own food in its own kitchens, too. "Ghost kitchen" and "virtual restaurant" describe brands that exist only as a menu on an app, with no street-level commercial presence; Wonder has slickly designed locations where customers can order, pick up, and, at least in theory, dine in at a handful of tables. Lately, the company's internal creative team of seven has coalesced around the tagline "A New Kind of Food Hall."
"I think that gets to the variety aspect," said Daniel Shlossman, who left a role as the marketing chief at Sweetgreen to join Wonder's senior leadership team in 2023. But also, he said, "we talk about it as the 'super-app of mealtime,"' a description that sums up Mr. Lore's ambition for Wonder's app to sell and deliver not only food from its own kitchens, but food from other restaurants, too, as well as meal kits, even groceries. (Wonder's offerings are not available via other delivery apps, which means customers will have to want its food enough to seek it out.)
Today, though, the main focus at Wonder is getting its own restaurants up and running. Its kitchens don't require gas-powered stoves and exhaust systems to vent cooking fumes, making for cheaper, quicker build-outs. Everything on the Wonder menu is designed to be cooked using three pieces of electric equipment: a hot water bath, a rapid-cook oven, and a fryer.
During a visit to Parsippany in January, Mr. Shlossman took me to see Wonder's research and development center, a series of gleaming test kitchens staffed with dozens of professional cooks clad in Wonder-branded chef's whites.
Wonder prepares and in many cases, par-cooks, all of its menu items in large commissary facilities, then distributes the dishes individually portioned to its restaurants, where employees can finish the preparation in a matter of minutes, with little cooking skill required. This allows the restaurants to be staffed by what Mr. Lore calls "lightly trained labor."
A small team of chefs demonstrated how a variety of items on Wonder's menus are cooked. Pasta alla vodka from Wonder's Alanza menu (theme: Italian American comfort food) is heated in a rapid-cook oven for 4 minutes and 30 seconds. A strip steak from Bobby Flay Steak cooks for 6 minutes on a polymer tray that Wonder's engineers say mimics the surface of a cast iron skillet.
There are as many as 500 items available for order at a given Wonder, across 28 distinct menus -- many of which were developed with, and bear the names of, well-known chefs like Mr. Flay, Mr. Andrés and Michael Symon. Mr. Lore said the company has spent $ 60 million to date acquiring the intellectual property, and hundreds of millions more on the culinary engineering, necessary to develop this particular food preparation system. More options will drive demand, goes the theory, and that demand will allow Wonder to cap its delivery zone to no farther away than 10 minutes.
Haunted by Failed Ghost Kitchens
Americans have been sending out for dinner since the 1950s, when a Los Angeles restaurant called Casa D'Amore began offering pizza for home delivery. For decades, though, the practice didn't move much beyond the pie or Chinese food. It wasn't until 1999, when a new website called SeamlessWeb began offering customers a way to order from their favorite restaurants via the internet, that delivery began its slow creep across the industry as a whole.
Today, delivery orders make up around 10 percent of all restaurant transactions, according to the food service consultancy Technomic; a 2021 poll conducted by Gallup showed that three-quarters of respondents ordered delivery at least once a month, with 14 percent ordering more than once a week. That's a major shift for an industry that for centuries revolved around customers eating on site, and it's fair to say that there are some kinks left to work out.
For restaurants, commissions paid to online marketplaces like Uber Eats and DoorDash are large enough that, in some cases, they erase the business's entire profit margin on the order. For the marketplaces, even those steep commissions don't always cover the cost of completing a delivery. For consumers, getting meals delivered is expensive, and the food not infrequently arrives soggy and lukewarm.
Mr. Lore is the latest in a long list of entrepreneurs -- most of whom, like him, have no prior experience in the restaurant business -- to look at this state of affairs and see an opening. During the 2010s, new services like Maple, Sprig, Spoonrocket, and Munchery popped up, serving meals that existed only for delivery. None were able to compete with the marketing muscle of apps like Seamless or Grubhub, and the wide array of options that they offered.
Then there are the ghost kitchens. CloudKitchens, Reef Kitchens and Kitchen United started out renting low-cost kitchen space to restaurants looking to expand their delivery output on the cheap; all three have begun to retrench, and the latter two companies have announced pivots to become software providers instead.
"A lot of the limitation for companies like this has to do with the fact that there's only so much delivery in the market," said Rich Shank, a senior principal at the food service consultancy Technomic. Although delivery grew substantially during the pandemic, Technomic's numbers show that demand has leveled off, and even contracted slightly.
The sector's less-than-stellar track record can make it hard to see why investors such as Bain Capital, GV (formerly known as Google Ventures) and Accel have been willing to back Wonder with such large sums.
Gad Allon, director of the Management and Technology Program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, says that Mr. Lore's main advantage is just that: capital. Previous start-ups were working with far less -- Munchery was by far the largest, with $ 125 million raised over its lifetime. "Munchery and all the rest of them, the moment they raised money, there was a lot of pressure to grow, not optimize and then grow," Mr. Allon said. "Lore's textbook from day one is to take an idea that sounds crazy and do everything that's possible to optimize it, and only then scale it."
Going Up Against Bezos
Friends and business associates like to talk about Mr. Lore in almost mythic terms. There's an oft-told story about the time Mr. Lore, a former college track athlete, challenged Jerry Rice, the legendary wide receiver, to race him in the 40-yard dash, and won (Mr. Lore was 47 at the time; Mr. Rice, 57). There's another one about how, on a whim, Mr. Lore qualified for the United States Olympic bobsledding team in 1996. He can count cards, and has been barred from playing blackjack at many casinos.
"I call him a five tool player, which is the highest compliment you can give in baseball," Alex Rodriguez told me. Mr. Lore and Mr. Rodriguez share part ownership in an N.B.A. team, the Minnesota Timberwolves, as well as in the W.N.B.A.'s Minnesota Lynx, and a venture capital fund they set up together in 2021.
Gwyneth Paltrow met Mr. Lore years ago through a mutual investor who felt he'd be useful to her as a mentor (she now sits on Wonder's board). "We became friends, and spent time together socially," she said, "but would have these very deep, deep dives both on e-commerce and marketing metrics and then on gut health, stuff like that."
Ms. Paltrow was one of many people to attest to Mr. Lore's reputation as a skilled magician and mentalist. Mr. Lore once did an illusion for her where he borrowed her phone, began typing, then put it face down on the table and asked her to name any song. When he turned up the volume on the phone, that song was playing. (Ms. Paltrow doesn't recall the exact song but remembers it was "something really random," possibly by Tears for Fears).
Mr. Lore, who grew up on Staten Island and in New Jersey, describes himself as a kid with lots of hustle but little interest in academics (he claims that, to this day, he has never read a work of fiction in its entirety). After Bucknell University, he worked his way up in the banking industry, working as the head of risk at Sanwa Bank by the time he was 27.
By that point, in the late '90s, the start-up scene was building momentum. Mr. Lore abruptly quit his job and plowed his life savings into creating an online trading card marketplace called the Pit, which he and his partners sold to Topps, the trading card company.
Mr. Lore's next start-up, Diapers.com, which he co-founded in 2005 with his childhood friend Vinit Bharara, was the one that made him rich -- and yet, it was also a defeat.
His vision was to take diapers, an item that was already a loss leader for brick-and-mortar stores, and lose even more money on them by selling them online with free, fast shipping. Mr. Lore believed that if you could use the diapers to create a loyal audience of new parents, you could then sell them enough other, high-margin items over time to make a profitable business. That notion was a direct threat to Amazon, which was still establishing itself as a store for far more than books. Jeff Bezos made it a personal mission to force Diapers.com into submission.
Amazon first slashed its own diaper prices so deeply that the rival site could not sustain the growth necessary to continue raising capital, and would be forced to entertain a sale. Walmart made a competing offer for Mr. Lore's company. Then Mr. Bezos's negotiators reportedly threatened that, if Walmart's offer was accepted, Amazon would discount diapers on its own site even more steeply to run Diapers.com into the ground. Before Diapers.com had yet turned profitable, Mr. Lore sold it to Amazon in 2011 for $ 550 million. According to an account of the transaction in Brad Stone's 2014 book "The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon," Amazon's offer was accepted "largely out of fear."
Mr. Lore said the sale didn't feel like a victory.
With his next startup, Jet.com, Mr. Lore came straight for Mr. Bezos. He aimed to create a new challenger to Amazon, luring away a segment of the retail giant's customer base by offering lower prices on household basics in exchange for small compromises, like fewer brand choices or slower shipping speeds. Mr. Lore raised $ 800 million on the idea, even while estimating that Jet would burn through $ 3 billion before reaching the scale necessary to become profitable. The company was acquired in 2016, just 10 months after its debut. Walmart, which was trying to build up its e-commerce, bought it for $ 3.3 billion.
Those wild, improbable exits have made Mr. Lore a figure of cult worship among aspiring billionaire types. As a guest on countless entrepreneurship podcasts, he lays out his win-big playbook, which centers on an atypical view of risk. Mr. Lore believes that while smaller investments can feel lower risk because the stakes are lower, in fact, the momentum generated by large capital investments actually reduces their risk of failure. Mr. Lore's strategy has served him well in the specific environment of big-money start-ups, yet neither of his big dot-com gambles managed to mature into stand-alone businesses that exist today.
"That's the chip on his shoulder," said Mr. Allon, of Wharton. "We know he can build a brand that sells to a larger firm. But can he build a brand that outlasts him?"
Going Into Sixth Gear
Mr. Lore's primary residence is a $ 44 million penthouse in the TriBeCa neighborhood of Manhattan, decorated in muted neutrals, and with a generosity of proportion reminiscent of a Restoration Hardware showroom. A Steinway grand piano sits in one corner, which Mr. Lore was learning to play until he bought the Timberwolves and decided it made more sense to focus on improving his basketball game instead.
Over a lunch of salmon and quinoa prepared by his personal chef, Mr. Lore said he'd been focused on addressing a string of other challenges, like optimizing Wonder's delivery operations. Thanks to the company's considerable upfront investment in designing hyper-efficient culinary processes, 10 of Wonder's 11 locations are profitable, the company said. Mr. Lore wants to figure out how to get future stores there faster.
One challenge that Mr. Lore does not mention is maintaining the food quality he needs to keep customers coming back as the company continues to grow. Wonder sells not just $ 7 burgers and $ 11 burritos, but also a $ 26 pork chop, $ 34 steaks, and many other items in the "fast fine" category. Conventional wisdom within the industry is that it becomes increasingly difficult to build a good enough ingredient supply chain, and find enough skilled labor, to execute at such a high level consistently across hundreds of outlets. Mr. Lore believes he's gotten around the issue by doing so much of the labor in manufacturing facilities, but it remains to be seen whether he's right.
"There's a lot that can fall apart going from one to 10 to 100 units," said Rich Shank of Technomic. "You start to get subtle inconsistencies that pop into the system, many of which require an elevated skill level to handle. You have to be willing to really invest in training and skill-building."
Mr. Lore describes himself as "24/7 on Wonder"; this latest capital push might require him to go into what he calls "sixth gear" -- a turbo-boost to his already hard-driving professional rhythms. As of mid-January, Mr. Lore had taken 160 fund-raising meetings in pursuit of the money he needs to move Wonder forward, sometimes stacking as many as 10 into a day. But this was merely fifth gear, he explained. He hadn't been in sixth gear yet at Wonder.
"I mean, you hope you don't have to go there," Mr. Lore said. "But somehow if this round doesn't come together or whatever, I am hyped up."

He’s Not Just Looking to Make a Quick Billion

When Marc Lore, an e-commerce billionaire, left his position as the CEO of Walmart.com in 2021, he began to dabble in a variety of long-odds attempts to change the world. He backed a nuclear fusion startup, and another designing flying taxis.
Recently, though, Lore has put all that aside to focus on an even bigger moonshot: solving dinner.
His latest scheme, a startup called Wonder, exists to tackle food delivery, which Lore believes too often disappoints customers by arriving too slowly.
Wonder’s opening salvo, in 2021, was flooding the New Jersey suburbs with hundreds of Mercedes Sprinter vans that could cook menus designed by celebrity chefs like Bobby Flay or José Andrés in customers’ driveways.
Initially, after founding the company, Lore was involved only as an adviser and investor. Then in 2022, shortly after a $350 million capital raise brought Wonder’s funding to $800 million, he took over leadership of the company, installing himself as CEO.
“This is once in a lifetime,” Lore said. “This could be the Amazon of food and beverage.”
On a recent Wednesday, Lore, 52, was huddled with his senior executive team at Wonder’s research and development facility in Parsippany, New Jersey, preparing for a board meeting. It had been a busy 2023: The company started the year by abandoning the meals-on-wheels strategy — the biggest problem, Lore said, was finding enough parking — and began cooking food the old-fashioned way, in kitchens.
Wonder built 10 locations in and around New York City. It more than doubled the breadth of its food offerings, bought meal kit company Blue Apron, secured a $100 million strategic investment from Nestlé, and signed a deal with Walmart to build Wonders in four of its stores.
The vision that Lore is now selling to his investors calls for Wonder to not just maintain that furious pace of growth, but ramp it up. Lore is attempting to round up $500 million in additional capital, which he says is crucial to getting the company through the next two years, at which point he plans to have 100 locations open. He has $200 million personally invested in Wonder, with a plan to commit $100 million more.
Lore said he’s targeting an initial public offering in three to five years, aiming for a valuation of $30 billion.
Previous upstarts attempting to reinvent food delivery have fizzled or flopped. Lore seemed unfazed. “There’s going to be a lot of failures,” he said. “And then somebody’s going to figure it out.”
Among the great many things there are to figure out at Wonder is how to describe to customers what it is. Lately, the company’s internal creative team has coalesced around the tagline “A New Kind of Food Hall.”
“I think that gets to the variety aspect,” said Daniel Shlossman, who left a role as the marketing chief at salad chain Sweetgreen to join Wonder’s senior leadership team in 2023. But also, he said, “we talk about it as the ‘super-app of mealtime,’” a description that sums up Lore’s ambition for Wonder’s app to sell and deliver food not only from its own kitchens but from other restaurants, as well as meal kits and even groceries.
Today, though, the main focus at Wonder is getting its own restaurants up and running. Its kitchens don’t require gas-powered stoves and exhaust systems to vent cooking fumes, making for cheaper, quicker build-outs. Everything on the Wonder menu is designed to be cooked using three pieces of electric equipment: a hot water bath, a rapid-cook oven and a fryer.
Wonder prepares, and in many cases par-cooks, all of its menu items in large commissary facilities, then distributes the dishes individually portioned to its restaurants, where employees can finish the preparation in a matter of minutes, with little cooking skill required.
Gad Allon, director of the Management and Technology Program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said that Lore’s main advantage is capital. Previous startups were working with far less. “Lore’s textbook from Day 1 is to take an idea that sounds crazy and do everything that’s possible to optimize it, and only then scale it,” Allon said.
Lore worked his way up in the banking industry, working as the head of risk at Sanwa Bank by the time he was 27. By that point, in the late ’90s, the startup scene was building momentum. Lore abruptly quit his job and plowed the sum total of his life savings into creating an online trading card marketplace called the Pit, which he and his partners sold to Topps, the trading card company.
Lore’s next startup, Diapers.com, which he founded in 2005 with his childhood friend Vinit Bharara, was the one that made him rich — and yet, it was also a defeat.
His vision was to take diapers, an item that was already a loss-leader for brick-and-mortar stores, and lose even more money on them by selling them online with free, fast shipping. Lore believed that if you could use the diapers to create a loyal audience of new parents, you could then sell them enough higher-margin items over time to make a profitable business. That notion was a direct threat to Amazon, and Jeff Bezos made it his goal to force Diapers.com into submission.
Amazon first slashed its own diaper prices so deeply that the rival site could not sustain the growth necessary to continue raising capital, and would be forced to entertain a sale. Walmart made a competing offer for Lore’s company. Then Bezos’ negotiators reportedly threatened that if Walmart’s offer was accepted, Amazon would discount diapers on its own site even more steeply. Before Diapers.com had yet turned profitable, Lore sold it to Amazon in 2011 for $550 million. According to an account of the transaction in Brad Stone’s 2014 book “The Everything Store,” Amazon’s offer was accepted “largely out of fear.”
Lore said the sale didn’t feel like a victory.
With his next startup, Jet.com, Lore aimed to create a new challenger to Amazon, luring away a segment of the retail giant’s customer base by offering lower prices on household basics in exchange for small compromises, like fewer brand choices or slower shipping speeds. Lore raised $800 million on the idea, even while estimating that Jet would burn through $3 billion before reaching the scale necessary to become profitable. The company was acquired in 2016, just 10 months after launch. Walmart, which was trying to build up its e-commerce, bought it for $3.3 billion.
Those wild, improbable exits have made Lore a figure of cult worship among aspiring billionaires. As a guest on countless entrepreneurship podcasts, he lays out his win-big playbook, which centers on an atypical view of risk. Lore believes that while smaller investments can feel lower-risk because the stakes are lower, in fact, the momentum generated by large capital investments actually reduces their risk of failure. Yet neither of Lore’s big dot-com gambles managed to mature into stand-alone businesses that exist today.
“That’s the chip on his shoulder,” Allon said. “We know he can build a brand that sells to a larger firm. But can he build a brand that outlasts him?”

Maine Kills Bill to Limit Extraction Of Its Water: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Maine's Legislature voted down a bill that would have limited large-scale pumping of groundwater in the state. Poland Spring, the bottled-water giant, had lobbied aggressively against the measure.
The proposal would have placed a 10-year limit on large-scale water-extraction contracts, a restriction that the bill's supporters said would protect Maine's precious groundwater at a time when water levels are falling across the country. It failed to pass on Thursday by a 21-to-12 vote in the State Senate.
Poland Spring, a major presence in Maine, draws water from eight locations around the state to bottle and sell. It is trying to lock in a new contract of up to 45 years to pump water in Lincoln, a former mill town.
BlueTriton -- which owns Poland Spring and other major bottled-water brands, including Arrowhead and Deer Park -- lobbied against the changes. Last year, The New York Times reported that the company wrote, and circulated among legislators, a proposed amendment that would have gutted the bill.
BlueTriton is backed financially by the private equity funds One Rock Capital Partners and Metropoulos & Co., which paid $ 4.3 billion in 2021 to buy Nestlé's North American bottled-water business.
The bill eventually made it to the full Legislature, where BlueTriton continued its lobbying. For example, one flyer circulated by a Poland Spring lobbyist to lawmakers noted that the state's public advocate's office had said that it encouraged local water utilities "to enter into agreements to sell water whenever it is cost effective to do so." However, William S. Harwood, Maine's public advocate, said in an email interview that he supported the 10-year limit. An earlier version of the bill had called for a seven-year limit.
In response to questions, BlueTriton said it stood by the statements in the circular, calling it a "a fact-based explanatory document." The company also said it had "a dedicated team of geologists, hydrogeologists, and engineers who work closely with state and local water agencies and environmental organizations to protect and conserve water as a renewable resource."
The bill was voted down in the Maine State House and the Senate, with Republicans voting against it, along with several Democrats. Margaret M. O'Neil, a Democrat from Saco, in Southern Maine, who sponsored the bill, said, "Mainers don't want Poland Spring to lock our communities into bad deals, and certainly not bad deals that last for decades."
Mark Lawrence, a Democrat who headed the committee that considered the bill and voted against it in the State Senate, and Trey Stewart, the Republican Senate minority leader who also voted against it, didn't respond to requests for comment.

Confronted With Child Labor in the U.S., Companies Move to Crack Down: [National Desk]

Full text: McDonald's, Costco and other major brands say they are stepping up efforts to keep minors from the grueling, often dangerous work that goes into their products.
Many major U.S. companies -- including some of the country's biggest consumer brands -- say they are taking steps to eliminate child labor in their domestic supply chains amid revelations that children are working throughout American manufacturing and food production.
As hundreds of thousands of migrant children have crossed the southern border without their parents since 2021, growing numbers have ended up in dangerous, illegal jobs in every state, including in factories, slaughterhouses and industrial dairy farms, The New York Times has reported in a series of articles.
Working to exhaustion, children have been crushed by construction equipment, gotten yanked into industrial machinery and fallen to their deaths from rooftops.
Now, McDonald's says it is requiring private inspectors to review overnight shifts at slaughterhouses that provide some of its meat, where children as young as 13 were cleaning heavy machinery. Suppliers for Ford Motor Company must now scrutinize the faces of employees when they arrive for work. Costco is commissioning more audits with Spanish-speaking inspectors.
Corporations have relied on private auditors to check for safety and labor problems at their suppliers, but those inspectors repeatedly failed to spot ongoing child labor violations, The Times reported in December. Auditors left factories in the afternoon, even though children are most often hired to work at night. They examined paperwork to check ages, but children tend to submit fake documents. And they focused on workers hired directly by plants, although children are often brought in by outside staffing agencies or contractors.
Along with McDonald's and Costco, Starbucks, Whole Foods and PepsiCo are revising the kinds of audits they require at their suppliers. The changes include enhancing reviews of night shifts and shifts run by outside contractors, such as cleaning companies, and moving away from announcing audits in advance.
"We have been actively evolving our focus on the risk of migrant child labor domestically," Whole Foods said in a statement.
Spanish-speaking auditors said recruiters were courting them as firms raced to staff up.
"United States Department of Labor and New York Times investigations into child labor at US businesses have shown that the United States is not a low-risk country for human rights risk for brands and retailers," read a recent job listing from the auditing firm Arche Advisors. "In the US we cannot complete all of the work requested."
The firm's chief executive, Greg Gardner, said in an interview that his company had seen an increase of almost 50 percent in its domestic audit business, including requests to look specifically for child labor. "We're doing a kind of audit we were never doing before," he said. "This is the biggest change I've seen in 29 years."
After The Times found children working for a Ford supplier in Michigan, the automaker said it was increasing audits and requiring that thousands of manufacturers begin looking over workers more carefully, even after they are hired. Security guards will inspect workers before every shift to ensure that their faces match their identification cards. Bob Holycross, the company's chief sustainability officer, said that while Ford had not itself found child labor, it had "strengthened our supplier code of conduct globally based on lessons learned."
Suppliers are also adding safeguards.
The Northwest Dairy Association said it was hiring auditors to interview night-shift workers at some 300 dairy farms. Children were operating industrial milking machines on some of these farms in violation of labor laws, and were sometimes seriously injured, The Times found. A major producer, the association provides milk for brands including Nestlé, Costco's Kirkland label and Safeway's house brand Lucerne through its marketing arm, Darigold.
Smithfield Foods, the country's largest pork producer, said it would bring in auditors annually to check the night shifts at 41 slaughterhouses and processing plants. The company has also posted signs in Spanish and other languages around its plants emphasizing age requirements.
Tyson Foods said it had added unannounced audits for sanitation shifts, and instructed security guards to watch for young faces. Still, some shareholders are pressing for more robust action.
Perdue Farms, where a 14-year-old's arm was maimed while he was working for a cleaning company at a Virginia slaughterhouse, said it has added age verification audits for contractors. After The Times reported last year that children hired by an outside staffing agency were working on Cheerios and other household products at the contract manufacturer Hearthside Food Solutions, the company said it had begun requiring workers to prove their ages with government-issued photo identification.
Packers Sanitation Services, which last year paid a $ 1.5 million fine from the U.S. Department of Labor for sending children to clean slaughterhouses, has gone even further. It has told hiring managers to reject job applicants if they look too young to match the ages in their documents, even if they pass every other kind of screening.
Some companies are opting to hire night-shift workers directly, rather than using contractors, to avoid potential violations. These include the global meatpacker JBS, where middle schoolers brought in by Packers Sanitation suffered chemical burns. This work will now be done in-house, by unionized workers.
The Times's December report focused on shortcomings in audits performed by UL Solutions, one of the country's largest firms that checks workplaces for labor violations as part of a so-called social audit. The company is planning an initial public offering, with a targeted valuation of $ 5 billion. This year, UL has been exploring selling off its social auditing business before the public offering, according to three people familiar with the talks. UL Solutions declined to comment.
Auditors expect child labor to be a major focus of corporations this year. In January, Amazon convened companies including Target, Disney and PepsiCo to discuss ways to eliminate underage workers in American supply chains. Another summit, this one sponsored by Walmart and focusing on improving social audits, is planned for March.
The nonprofit groups Verité and AIM-Progress, which promote responsible labor practices, are retraining 600 American suppliers and staffing agencies. The initiative is funded by 12 corporations, including some companies that The Times found had benefited from migrant child labor: McDonald's; General Mills; the snack food giant Mondelez, which owns Oreo and dozens of other products; Cheez-It's owner, Kellanova; and Unilever, the company behind Ben & Jerry's. The new guidance directs suppliers to ensure that any children found working are given social services, and not simply fired.
"They should also be looking at what they're paying people," said Verité's chief executive, Shawn MacDonald, "and why they're having trouble finding people beyond children who are willing to take this work."

This Chicken and Rice Dish Has a Little Bite: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: In this easy sheet-pan meal, turmeric-ginger chicken roasts on a bed of crispy, scallion-flecked rice.
My first attempt at crunchy rice was not entirely on purpose. I was a young, multitasking cook with a pot of rice left on low heat until ... wait, was something about to burn?
I salvaged what tender grains I could and was about to plunge the pot and its residual crust into a sink of soapy water, when I caught a whiff of something caramelized and toasty. I dislodged a shard of crust with a butter knife to sample, then went back, sprinkling the next with salt. Before I knew it, I was full, and the pot was clean.
Recipe: Sheet-Pan Turmeric Chicken and Crispy Rice
By now, I've learned that this layer of crunchy, golden rice that can form at the bottom of the pot is rightly prized across cultures, be it Persian tahdig, Korean nurungji or Spanish socarrat, to name just a few. Achieving the ideal layer of crisp rice is the kind of culinary feat that takes long practice -- or, occasionally -- dumb luck.
Or you could use this simple hack: Spread cooked, oiled rice on a sheet pan and bake it at high heat. The large surface area of the sheet pan will dry the rice before it browns, making it especially crunchy, and the oven's steady, indirect heat helps keep the rice from burning -- a welcome relief for us multitasking cooks.
For this technique, I particularly adore the textural contrast of short-grain rice, because while the plump, starchy grains get nicely crisp where they meet the bottom and edges of the pan, the top stays softer and chewy. But long-grain rice, which takes on a consistently crunchy texture, also works.
Since you have a sheet pan of rice in the oven, you may as well put some protein on top to make it a meal. For this recipe, I slather bone-in chicken legs with a pungent mix of turmeric, ginger and garlic, and nestle them into a pan of rice flecked with scallion for sweetness. The spiced chicken fat renders and coats the rice as it roasts. Then, at the very end, I dab everything with more of the turmeric-ginger mixture, adding yet another dimension of fragrance and verve.
There are, of course, no shortcuts to the nuanced flavors of tahdig or nurungji or socarrat, but this dish makes for a deliciously easy one-pan meal that will come out right every time, without either practice or luck.

Full text: One day about 60 years ago, the comedian Bert Lahr put on a devil suit, held up a potato chip and uttered a phrase that would become a food-marketing milestone: "Betcha can't eat just one."
Positioning food as deliciously addictive, as Lay's did in its sly TV commercial, became advertising gold. In the decades that followed, Oreos and freezer waffles ("L'eggo my Eggo!") were portrayed as so irresistible that people fought over them. A popular stoner movie, "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle," chronicled two friends' obsessions with fast-food sliders.
Craveability became such a selling point that Kellogg's went all in and named a chocolate-filled cereal Krave. High-end chefs weren't immune. Christina Tosi, known for the hyper-sweet desserts at her Milk Bar shops, named one of them Crack Pie.
But we're now in the Ozempic era. A class of new drugs that eliminate food cravings, as well as a fresh body of scientific studies, have focused attention on the connection between addiction and food. Ultra-processed foods, made with cheap industrial ingredients and potentially as addictive as tobacco or gambling, are emerging as a national concern.
What's a food marketer to do? Some who work in or study the nation's $ 1 trillion food industry describe the moment as not much more than a speed bump. Food companies are nimble at surfing the cultural waves and finding new ways to keep customers reaching for another helping.
Others say it's a watershed moment in how Americans eat, and will change how companies sell food.
"It's an existential threat to the food industry and certainly an existential threat to the processed food industry," said Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University who has written extensively on food policy and science. "You've got all these things coming together in a way they've never come together before."
Back in the 1960s, when Lay's dared the nation to resist, "it didn't even occur to anybody that wanting more chips could be bad," said Steve Siegelman, a marketing creative director who has worked with the beef industry, Kikkoman and Häagen-Dazs.
Casting food as irresistible or craveable has already begun to fall out of favor, he said, but it remains perfectly acceptable as a business-to-business tactic. Hidden Valley Ranch, for example, uses the slogan "Give them the cup they crave" in its ads in restaurant trade publications.
Sheer overuse has started to sap the marketing power of craveability, said Mike Kostyo, a vice president of the food industry consulting company Menu Matters, whose clients include brands like Dunkin' and Del Monte Foods. But as an underlying concept, he said, it's not going away.
"It's so central to how we market so many foods," he said. "All that imagery of oozing cheese and the sound of the crunch."
Mr. Kostyo said several clients have asked him how worried they should be about the runaway popularity of drugs like semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (in Mounjaro), which people credit with silencing what they describe as "food noise," or constant thoughts about eating. He tells them it's too early to say.
If selling the addictive nature of a snack stops working, he said, the industry will find something else that will.
Food companies ran into a similar challenge in the early 1990s, when fat was cast as the dietary demon. They responded with products like SnackWell's, a line of fat- and cholesterol-free cookies that was so popular it was often in short supply. Baked Lay's, with fewer calories and less fat than the original, mounted a $ 50 million ad campaign showing supermodels fishing or playing poker. The slogan: "You can eat like one of the boys, but still look like one of the girls." The commercials ended, of course, with Lay's time-tested tagline.
Michael Moss, a former New York Times reporter who has written two books explaining how some food companies use science, marketing and political influence to get consumers hooked on their products, doesn't expect drugs like Ozempic to make any difference.
"Getting us to lose control is part of their business plan," he said of the processed food industry. "I was chatting with an industry lobbyist who said Vitamin O scares us about as much as Michelle Obama's 'Let's Move' campaign" to get children to eat better and exercise more.
In its recent annual report on the food and beverage industry, the market research company Mintel posited that consumer demand for minimally processed food will grow, and suggested that manufacturers focus on the benefits of food processing, like extending freshness or promoting food safety.
The report also offered a strategy for selling products with no redeeming nutritional value: "Brands that produce highly, overly or ultra-processed food and drink products will need to remind consumers of the joy and comfort they get from these products."
But instead of telling consumers what a product can do for them, many marketers pore through social media to find out what they want, said Caitlin Reynolds, an executive vice president at the advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi.
"It's like an unprompted focus group that runs 24/7," she said.
In 2021, Ms. Reynolds led a team that in created an award-winning ad campaign for Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers inspired by the shutdown phase of the pandemic, when people posted that they ate the snacks by the handful while working from home. The multiplatform campaign featured Boban Marjanovic, the N.B.A. player with the largest hands, holding as many of the crackers as he could.
Although Goldfish are a mainstay in homes with young children, the snack has become a top seller with teenagers who grew up eating them. "Gen Z loves nostalgia," Ms. Reynolds said.
And although brand integrity matters to members of Generation Z, according to Mr. Kostyo of Menu Matters, they don't have the same health focus as the Millennial generation, with its grain bowls and nut milks.
"With Gen Z we see a movement away from that," he said. "They love candy and Taco Bell and TikTok-y foods."
Strategies for selling food to Generation Z and it successor, Alpha, the oldest members of which are 14, rely less on one message repeated in traditional advertising and more on deft use of social media. They also include fun, outrageous collaborations between brands, like the Nacho Cheese Dorito-flavored liquor that the snack giant recently created with Empirical, a company started by alumni of the elite Copenhagen restaurant Noma.
Still, some companies are sticking with the old get-'em-hooked approach. In 2022, Taco Bell pioneered a subscription offer, in which $ 10 bought a taco a day for a month. In November, it added a subscription for nacho fries.
And last week -- because sometimes sheer irresistibility still works -- the company introduced a Cravings Value Menu.

What America's Eating Affects Its Water: [Letter]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "America's Diet Is Feeding a Groundwater Crisis" ("Uncharted Waters" series, front page, Dec. 30):
The world has been making meat basically the same way for about 10,000 years, by feeding crops to animals, so that humans can eat animals.
This method of meat production is inefficient, requiring vast quantities of land and water, and shifting crop production to lower-value crops for animal feed from high-value crops for human consumption.
Plant-based and cultivated meat use far less land and water, and they have a host of other benefits. The Center for Strategic and International Studies released a report in May documenting how these "alternative proteins" can create opportunities for farmers, jobs in the heartland, more choices for consumers and robust export markets.
Like any more efficient production method, these new ways of making meat are a win-win for industry, which is why we're seeing leadership in these sectors from major meat and food companies including ADM (Archer-Daniels-Midland), Cargill, Tyson, Nestle and JBS.
The C.S.I.S. report also documents benefits to our economic and national security and argues that the government should create favorable policies for these industries, similar to policies that support "pharmaceuticals, clean energy technology and advanced chips for artificial intelligence."

To the Editor:
You know what else besides changing tastes may be contributing to the overtaxing of America's aquifers? More mouths to feed.
Your story identifies the cause of the water crisis as a "dietary shift" in the country toward more chicken and cheese, which it says has driven a huge acreage expansion of water-intensive crops used for animal feed. But there is not a single mention of population growth.
It's not just that Americans doubled their per capita chicken and cheese consumption in the past 40 years; it's that there are more than 100 million additional U.S. residents than there were back then. And the portion of U.S. animal feed that is exported is going to a world population that has increased 80 percent from 1980.
How much of the stress on the country's groundwater is attributable to the general nutritional needs of a growing population versus its "food choices"? The article never addresses the matter. In fact, the population effect gets little, if any, attention in much environmental reporting, which seems like a conspicuous omission.

Don't Resist Paxlovid as Covid Rises Again
To the Editor:
Re "Few Take Paxlovid, Even as Covid Surges Again" (front page, Jan. 5):
I regret that so few of my primary care colleagues prescribe Paxlovid to adults who test positive for Covid.
Drug interactions are easy to manage, usually by temporarily stopping or reducing the dose of the interacting medication. The metallic aftertaste is easy to manage (I advise patients to purchase mints, Life Savers or Tic Tacs when they pick up their Paxlovid prescription).
And the idea that relapse is more common in those who take Paxlovid as compared with those who don't has been soundly debunked (the risk of relapse is small, whether or not Paxlovid is used).
Primary care providers who are unavailable to patients who need them after hours or on weekends -- online comments on the article were replete with stories of patients unable to obtain prescriptions -- need to reconsider their choice of profession.
And 48,000 avoidable deaths from Covid, cited in a Paxlovid study that you report on, are not to be taken lightly.
Mark E. Horowitz

The writer is a family physician.
To the Editor:
While your article accurately identifies barriers to Paxlovid use, it overlooks how pandemic fatigue shapes public attitudes about new Covid treatments. Attributing low use in part to patient wariness overlooks the need for proactive physician engagement and public health outreach.
This outreach should target vulnerable communities directly, such as seniors, the uninsured and people of color. For instance, assisted living facilities and retirement communities could partner with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to run awareness campaigns.
Rather than assume that patients will decline, providers ought to start conversations to address hesitancy and falsehoods. Indeed, physicians should proactively address pandemic fatigue and other concerns, while educating patients about Paxlovid's lifesaving potential.

Taylor Swift's Community of Fans
To the Editor:
Re "The Joy of Communal Girlhood, the Anguish of Teen Girls," by Jessica Bennett (Opinion, Dec. 31):
I couldn't resist this essay as a die-hard Beyoncé and Taylor Swift fan, a mother of young kids, and someone who remembers viscerally the difficult days of middle school and worries for today's kids who navigate them amid social media.
Ms. Bennett's account of watching the Eras movie (which I also watched, riveted, from my couch) rang true. That "perfect window of girlhood" Ms. Swift helps us access is not something only girls can reach. Adults are accessing it, too. It's a state, as Ms. Bennett notes, of self-knowledge without self-consciousness and of owning imperfections and sharing them freely. It's being open and vulnerable without fearing (or even realizing) it.
As we get older, notwithstanding the constant oversharing on social media, authentic vulnerability becomes scarce. Ms. Swift's lyrics, capturing every detail of her ups and downs, transport us back to that place of unabashed imperfection and figuring-it-all-out -- and we experience that as a community. The communal fan experience, cheesy though it sounds, helps us overcome today's obstacles to authentic human connection.

Replace Harris With Whitmer as the V.P. Candidate
To the Editor:
Re "The Election No One Seems to Want Is Coming," by Gail Collins and Bret Stephens (The Conversation, Jan. 9):
I agree with Mr. Stephens that replacing Kamala Harris with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan as President Biden's vice-presidential candidate would be a smart move for the Democratic ticket.
Ms. Harris shows little spark and is a drag on a Biden re-election. She does not present any particular reasons to vote for Mr. Biden.
Ms. Whitmer would. She has been a charismatic governor, standing up to the far right in her state and not taking any nonsense from her political opponents. I believe she would be appealing to many centrists as a future president. She's someone you can believe in.
Mr. Biden should appeal to Ms. Harris to step aside in the interests of the party and the country, with promises of a significant role -- certainly more substantial than what veeps tend to do -- in a hoped-for second Biden term.
This idea could be a win-win, especially if Ms. Harris could find her way to proposing it herself for reasons easily explained to her supporters.

Full text: The fourth album by the Colombian American songwriter makes bliss triumphant.
Kali Uchis basks in pleasure on her fourth studio album, "Orquídeas." Make that pleasures: carnal, material, romantic, sonic, competitive and, if necessary, vengeful, all with a girlish nonchalance. The album begins with loops of laughter and ethereal oohs and ahs; it ends with Uchis thanking listeners with a "mwah" kiss. It's an album of breezy confidence and sly ingenuity, easily moving among futuristic electronics, 1990s nostalgia and Latin roots.
"Orquídeas" are orchids: the national flower of Colombia, where Uchis's parents were born. Uchis -- Karly-Marina Loaiza -- was born and grew up in Virginia, but she made long visits to Colombia while growing up. Orchids are colorful, alluring, fleshy, delicate, demanding and coveted, just as Uchis has presented herself throughout her recording career. In her new songs, she's an irresistible, knowing object of desire. "I make 'em beg for it," she announces in the album's opening song, "¿Cómo Así?" ("How So?"), singing, "If you come around here, you'll never wanna leave."
Uchis, 29, has deliberately alternated between albums with lyrics primarily in English or Spanish, and "Orquídeas" is nominally her latest Spanish-language album. But now that she has built a worldwide audience, her new songs are fluidly bilingual; they casually switch between English and Spanish, sometimes in mid-phrase. "I get a lil bit crazy pero es no mi culpa," she sings in "Me Pongo Loca" ("I Get Crazy"), adding "Es que soy apasionada." ("It's not my fault -- it's that I'm passionate.")
Uchis and her many songwriting and production collaborators draw on expertly seductive pop and R&B from past generations, often using 21st-century technology to extrapolate from the plush, whispery fantasies of 1990s R&B hitmakers like Janet Jackson and Aaliyah. Lavishly layered vocals nestle among glimmering electronic sounds and programmed beats, and on "Orquídeas," her voice sounds completely untethered by gravity.
She polished this approach on her 2020 album, "Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios)." But while songs on that album -- like the irresistible hit "Telepatía" ("Telepathy") -- often dealt with unfulfilled longings, on "Orquídeas" Uchis is triumphant. She gets whatever she desires: pampering and a man's submission in "Diosa" ("Goddess"), loyalty and togetherness in "Tu Corazón Es Mío" ("Your Heart Is Mine"), blissful sex in "Young Rich & in Love," where she coos, in Spanish, "On top of you, I feel free."
Most of "Orquídeas" luxuriates in slowly swaying ballads. But now and then, Uchis gets friskier; that's when she turns to Latin styles and star connections. She enlisted the rappers El Alfa, from the Dominican Republic, and JT, from the Miami group City Girls, for "Muñekita" ("Doll"), a plinking, thumping, cleverly tempo-shifting dembow track that celebrates hotness while it brutally dismisses rivals. In "Labios Mordidos" ("Bitten Lips"), Uchis and the Colombian songwriter Karol G harmonize over a reggaeton beat and tease, "Tonight I'm a lesbian, you make me want it."
Uchis reaches back to vintage Latin styles for two pivotal tracks: "Te Mata," ("It Kills You") midway through the album, and "Dame Beso/Muévete" ("Give Me a Kiss/Move It") as the finale. "Te Mata" is an old-fashioned, string-laden bolero with a halo of overdubbed voices; Uchis sweetly twists the knife as she tells an ex that she's happy with a new lover. "Dame Beso/Muevete" embraces two eras of Dominican Republic tradition, starting as a modern, piano-and-horn-driven merengue and then jumping further back to an older, rural-style, accordion-pumped perico ripiao. It carries Uchis from her celestial electronic flirtations to an earthy, sweaty dance floor, where she's ready to let her body move.

Full text: The stories are juicy, but the volume is perhaps tied to a persistent question: Why do so many people believe so many crazy things?
Nobody joins a cult. They just joined an exciting group of people trying to change the world. They just wanted to empower themselves, to feel better, to know Jesus, to do drugs with interesting people, to be different from their parents, to live off the grid. Then things got hairy and now here they are, sagely describing this process to a dutiful filmmaker.
Our current cult documentary boom has been going strong for years now, beginning in earnest with 2018's "Wild Wild Country" and not really letting up. There has been "Jonestown: Terror in the Jungle," "Heaven's Gate: The Cult of Cults," "The Way Down," "Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey," "Stolen Youth: Inside the Cult at Sarah Lawrence," "Waco: American Apocalypse," "Shiny Happy People," "The Deep End," "In the Name of God: A Holy Betrayal." There were two Nxivm documentaries -- "The Vow" and "Seduced: Inside the Nxivm Cult" -- and two more on the online romance group Twin Flames Universe: "Desperately Seeking Soulmate" and "Escaping Twin Flames." In the past month or so there has been "Love Has Won" on HBO and "Born Into Synanon," on Paramount+. This is nowhere near a comprehensive list.
So what's to account for our apparently bottomless appetite for such tales? (Streamers wouldn't keep making them if nobody was watching.) Well, on a purely craven level, these stories are juicy as hell -- sex, love, murder, redemption, ecstatic connections and a rending of the social fabric. Money, money, money. You'd be crazy not to make a documentary about all of it, about all the weird hairdos and strange lingo, all the anguish and absurdity.
But the volume and repetition perhaps reflects a broader, persistent sense of unease, a need to ask, over and over: How in the world do people believe things like this? Why do people worship lies? Is there a way to show them the light?
Oh, gosh, if anyone knew the answer to that, we'd be living in a very different world. Individually, these documentaries demonstrate that lots of people believe lots of garbage. Taken as a whole body, though, they suggest that, actually, nearly everyone believes at least a little garbage.
Some of the better documentaries stress the relationship between high-control groups and general social ills: "Seduced," the shorter but more perceptive Nxvim documentary, highlights the misogyny that drove much of the organization. "The Way Down" traces an Evangelical leader's message from intense body shaming to even more intense advocacy for corporal punishment.
The less curious instantiations, which present the leaders' hectoring and philosophizing at length, can start to feel misguided. They're like those 1990s girls-magazine articles about the dangers of eating disorders that also doubled as how-to guides for budding anorexics.
But even as quality and particulars vary, there is a sameness to a lot of these shows. Subjects ready themselves and chat to off-camera producers. We see joyous footage of the early days, and then usually an ex-member says, "Or that's what I thought," or sometimes, "But then things started to change." Some former members are horrified by what they've done, and others want to make sure the story includes the good parts, too, or they even still believe. Sometimes family members describe their heartache.
Many of these groups have already been the subjects of at least one podcast or article before making the leap to television. If you're interested in high-control groups in general, this can make the TV documentaries feel even more repetitive.
In format, perspective, style and distribution, the contemporary cult exposé nestles in comfortably with two other recent booms: true crime and scam sagas. Cults are also adjacent to conspiracies, another growth industry -- both are forms of tribalism defined by their distance from reality. Synanon and the like sit alongside stories of Theranos, crypto frauds, pyramid schemes and QAnon not just on streaming services, but also within the greater misinformation and disinformation diaspora.
There's a gawking appeal to this programming, of course, and a reasonable desire to hold people accountable for causing so much despair. But after spending hundreds of hours hearing from all sorts of devotees, what becomes clear is that participation in a cult is often a response to the sorrows of the world, to its shortcomings and capricious cruelty, to being stuck or maligned or afraid. No, we are not all equally susceptible to undue influence, but if you've ever bought something because of advertising, easy does it on that high horse.
In "Escaping Twin Flames," a former member says her deconstruction occurred when the leader told her to write a report on the two Nxivm documentaries to affirm the ways he was not a cult leader. "Every point we were coming across when we were doing this research was pointing to the fact that he was, in fact, a cult leader," she says. "Things started to churn at that point."
Perhaps things start to churn for viewers, too. The drive to understand others is also a drive to understand ourselves. Could it be that the appeal of cult stories partly reflects a desire to deconstruct pernicious control in our own lives? Or to at least reconsider the extent to which we've substituted the standards of capitalism, patriarchy, diet culture, consumerism, improv comedy, whatever, for our own? If we can nail down how other people get fooled and then unfooled, then maybe we'd know what to do when something seems not quite right.
It is scary when you begin to think that the institutions, leaders and premises that define your life and way of thinking may be corrupt and illegitimate. But maybe if you could watch, oh, hundreds of people in a variety of smaller contexts on every streaming platform and cable network go through that process, the path forward would become a little clearer. You would have some idea of where to head. You might feel less isolated. Actually, maybe we could watch together. In fact, we could form a little group.

An Industry Paid to Find Child Laborers, Doesn't: [National Desk]

Full text: One morning in 2019, an auditor arrived at a meatpacking plant in rural Minnesota. He was there on behalf of the national drugstore chain Walgreens to ensure that the factory, which made the company's house brand of beef jerky, was safe and free of labor abuses.
He ran through a checklist of hundreds of possible problems, like locked emergency exits, sexual harassment and child labor. By the afternoon, he had concluded that the factory had no major violations. It could keep making jerky, and Walgreens customers could shop with a clear conscience.
When night fell, another 150 workers showed up at the plant. Among them were migrant children who had come to the United States by themselves looking for work. Children as young as 15 were operating heavy machinery capable of amputating fingers and crushing bones.
Migrant children would work at the Monogram Meat Snacks plant in Chandler, Minn., for almost four more years, until the Department of Labor visited this spring and found such severe child labor violations that it temporarily banned the shipment of any more jerky.
In the past two decades, private audits have become the solution to a host of public relations headaches for corporations. When scandal erupts over labor practices, or shareholders worry about legal risks, or advocacy groups demand a boycott, companies point to these inspections as evidence that they have eliminated abuses in their supply chains. Known as social compliance audits, they have grown into an $ 80 billion global industry, with firms performing hundreds of thousands of inspections each year.
But a New York Times review of confidential audits conducted by several large firms shows that they have consistently missed child labor.
Children were overlooked by auditors who were moving quickly, leaving early or simply not sent to the part of the supply chain where minors were working, The Times found in audits performed at 20 production facilities used by some of the nation's most recognizable brands.
Auditors did not catch instances in which children were working on Skittles and Starburst candies, Hefty brand party cups, the pork in McDonald's sandwiches, Gerber baby snacks, Oreos, Cheez-Its or the milk that comes with Happy Meals.
In a series of articles this year, The Times has revealed that migrant children, who have been coming to America in record numbers, are working dangerous jobs in every state, in violation of labor laws. Children often use forged documents that slip by auditors who check paperwork but do not speak with most workers face-to-face. Corporations suggest that supply chains are reviewed from start to finish, but sub-suppliers such as industrial farms remain almost entirely unscrutinized.
The expansion of social compliance audits comes as the Labor Department has shrunk, with staffing levels now so low that it would take more than 100 years for inspectors to visit every workplace in the department's jurisdiction once. For many factories, a private inspection is the only one they will ever get.
Auditors for several firms said they are encouraged to deliver findings in the mildest way possible as they navigate pressure from three different sources: the independent auditing firms that pay their salaries; corporations, such as Walgreens, that require inspections at their suppliers; and the suppliers themselves, which usually must arrange and pay for the audits.
The auditor who looked at the Minnesota jerky factory for Walgreens was Joshua Callington. He has conducted more than 1,000 audits in the past decade.
"If audits are done correctly, the world could be a better place," he said. "Bettering the lives of workers is what these audits are supposed to be about."
But more and more, he said, each audit had begun to feel like a struggle between wanting the truth and trying to avoid conflict.
He had not seen any child labor in the Minnesota factory. To keep to his work schedule, he had to leave for his next audit at 4 p.m., long before the late shift arrived. Spotting problems had also led to tension between Mr. Callington and his employer, UL Solutions, which began as a safety testing business and expanded more than two decades ago into social compliance audits. The company took in $ 2.5 billion in revenue last year and is on the cusp of an initial public offering.
What Mr. Callington saw as a commitment to his job, his firm seemed to see as overzealousness.
"The assessment is not meant to be a policing effort," the UL Solutions employee handbook says.
After Mr. Callington failed three Walgreens suppliers in 2017 and 2018 for abusive working conditions, the chain complained about his communication style and asked for him to be taken off its account. UL put him on a remediation plan for about a year. (Walgreens declined to comment on the incident, but said it only rarely asks for auditors to be removed. In response to questions about the Monogram factory, the company said it had cut ties with the supplier. Monogram said it is now using stronger age-verification procedures.)
This spring, Mr. Callington flagged labor issues involving adult migrant workers at a warehouse that supplies Costco's potatoes. The plant's management complained that he was demanding and argumentative, and his supervisor barred him from returning. Mr. Callington believed that the supplier objected to his finding 21 violations when the previous audit had found none. UL Solutions, which still employs Mr. Callington, declined to comment on either incident.
The supervisor said Mr. Callington would have to complete a series of customer service trainings, and concluded with an inspirational quote that he attributed to the poet Maya Angelou.
"'People will forget what you said. They will forget what you did. But they will never forget how you made them feel,"' he wrote in an email. "Keep this in mind as you are interacting with our clients during your audits."
Night Shifts, Daytime Audits
In dozens of interviews, auditors said that sometimes their firms provide little more than a veneer of compliance for global corporations, which overstate how rigorously they review sprawling supply chains.
Auditors typically start their inspections in the morning and stay for about seven hours, even at 3,000-person factories that operate around the clock. In practice, this means that late afternoon and night shifts, where child labor violations most often occur, are almost never seen.
This year, the Department of Labor imposed a $ 1.5 million fine against Packers Sanitation Services, which provides cleaning crews to slaughterhouses. Investigators found that the company was employing more than 100 children, including 13-year-olds, to clean back saws and head splitters overnight.
These plants had been supplying McDonald's and Costco for years, and the corporations required regular audits. Some of those auditors noted that there was a large night shift run by the sanitation company, but said they had not been able to observe any of the workers. One auditor who was checking a Nebraska plant for Costco's Kirkland brand beef spoke with 20 out of 3,500 workers -- as is standard in much of the industry -- and left at noon, an inspection showed. In another audit at the same plant, the inspector left at 1:30 p.m.
Costco and McDonald's said in statements that they were strengthening their auditing standards. Packers said it had improved age verification of its workers.
Even if auditors had stayed later at the plants, they might not have been able to talk privately with the migrant child workers, who largely speak Spanish or Indigenous languages of Central America. Auditing firms rarely provide interpreters.
"You're supposed to ask another worker to translate. But you're trying to unearth something that people aren't trying to yell from the rooftops," said Juanita Sanchez-Sevilla, a Spanish speaker who has been conducting audits since the 1990s, including for the leading firms Intertek and Bureau Veritas. "If you look at the upper echelons of the industry, they're all white."
In the absence of in-person interviews, auditors rely on paperwork. But children use forged documents. This summer, for instance, a 16-year-old from Guatemala was killed while cleaning a Mississippi slaughterhouse that supplies Chick-fil-A. His documents said he was in his 30s. In a statement, Chick-fil-A said it was reviewing how it investigates violations at plants.
Research has shown that outside audits are less conclusive than companies suggest. A 2021 analysis of 40,000 audits by a Cornell professor found that nearly half had relied on forged or dubious documents. An earlier study that explored the industry's financial conflicts of interest found that auditors report fewer violations when factories are paying the bill.
In a statement, UL Solutions said that audits provide a snapshot for companies, which are ultimately responsible for enforcing their standards. An audit, the statement said, "cannot and does not guarantee that an audited facility is in full compliance with requirements against which it was audited, and does not confirm or certify compliance with laws."
In the absence of thorough inspections, child workers can stay hidden for years.
In 2020, an auditor visited a snack food factory in Geneva, Ill., to do an inspection required by the baby food giant Gerber. As it always had, Gerber's report came back clear of child labor. The factory was also being regularly audited for the makers of Starburst and Skittles candies, Oreos and Cheez-Its. The companies behind those products said in statements that they had not seen indications of child labor in any inspections.
However, some migrant children were working on these products at the time. Among them was Efren Baldemar, who described getting the job with false identification at 14 years old. He was working from 10 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. to help support his family in Guatemala, renting space in a house of strangers.
In the mornings, he went from the factory to ninth grade and often fell asleep at his desk. The pace on the assembly lines was grueling. "If you didn't keep up, the product would back up, and the machines would smoke," he said.
The manufacturer, Hearthside Food Solutions, has been under federal and state investigations since The Times revealed child labor at other facilities in February. In a statement last week, the company said it "has never knowingly employed underage labor in our facilities." It said it could not find a record of Efren working at its plant.
Plant inspections are typically scheduled weeks in advance, and auditors say they risk upsetting factories by arriving even a few minutes early.
"If you tell them when you're showing up, they can game it," said Doug Cahn, who created the audit system for Reebok International and now advises other corporations. "They know auditors don't come back to see if the lights are on at the meatpacking plant at 3 a.m."
In some cases, the Times review of audits showed, auditors certified plants as free of child labor but acknowledged in their reports that they didn't really know if that was true.
An auditor representing Walgreens reported that there was no way to verify the ages of workers at a Chicago-area factory distributing disposable plates and cups. At the time, the factory was also supplying products for Sysco, Hefty and Walmart's Great Value brand, according to the audit. The plant was using a staffing agency that refused to share paperwork, the auditor noted.
Hefty and Walgreens said that they have stopped using the supplier. Sysco said it did not generally audit U.S. suppliers, while Walmart declined to comment.
The staffing agency is now under a state investigation for possible child labor violations.
Nagging Questions
In his career, Mr. Callington had never found a case of migrant child labor, which would trigger an automatic failing grade. But now looking back, he suspected he had often audited plants where children were working.
Earlier this year, Mr. Callington asked managers at UL Solutions if Costco or other corporations might be willing to start requiring unannounced nighttime inspections. He pointed out news coverage that mentioned child labor raids at slaughterhouses.
"I have audited these locations and was never able to detect these issues given that we are only present for the first shift," he wrote.
A manager said she would raise the question with higher-ups. He never heard anything more about it.
Mr. Callington sometimes squeezes in five audits a week, staying on the road for six-week stretches. He flies between coasts so regularly that he has stopped thinking of himself as having a home-base time zone, and during long drives occasionally turns to his phone to ask, "Hey, Siri, where am I?"
This fall, he found himself in Oregon looking over the supply chain for the store-brand milk sold at Costco.
A company called Darigold, which processes milk for an association of 300 Northwest dairy farms, was paying for Mr. Callington to review its Portland plant. A manager toured him around the gleaming factory, which was suffused with the sweet smell of milk.
He looked over the spinning bottling machines, but did not ask about the dairies that supplied the milk. He had once tried to look at a sub-supplier for Costco when he wandered into a hen house at a different facility that was packing eggs. The factory complained that he had gone beyond the scope of his audit, he said.
By late afternoon, he was thanking the Portland team for their hospitality and leaving to prepare for his next inspection. He had given the milk plant a perfect score on Costco's child labor standards: free of illegal child labor (requirement No. 140), free of children working excessive hours (No. 144) and free of instances of child labor in the past (No. 142).
But a few hours away, 17-year-old Miguel Sanchez was in the middle of his shift at a Darigold milk supplier, where he had been working 12-hour days for nearly two years.
'No Option Except to Keep Going'
Miguel came to Washington's Yakima Valley from Mexico to live with an older brother, and immediately began working at an industrial dairy with fake identification that said he was an adult. It was a violation of child labor laws for him to work instead of going to school, but he had to contribute to the rent, and felt pressure to support his parents back home.
"I was tired a lot when I started because you have to work really fast, but my family was proud of me," he said.
In May, Miguel was trying to corral several dozen cows in a milking pen when a co-worker accidentally shut the gate and trapped him inside. Two cows, each weighing about half a ton, pushed him up against the metal bars.
Miguel felt the air leave his lungs and his spine start to buckle. He tried to shout, but his co-worker did not hear him over the thrum of machinery, and he began to pass out. A supervisor took him to the hospital.
Six months later, pain still radiated from his back into his legs as he ran up and down the floor of a warehouse hooking and unhooking cows from milking machines. He regularly downed an over-the-counter drug called Backaid to get through the workday, but it seemed to do less and less. Even standing had become excruciating.
"It feels like electric shocks all through my body," he said last month. "But I have no option except to keep going. I have to make money."
It is unclear if the milk Miguel collected ended up in the facility that Mr. Callington audited. Darigold's milk is processed in 11 plants around the Northwest. Workers said they often saw minors in the dairies, and The Times spoke with a half-dozen children who came to the United States alone and worked full time for Darigold suppliers in Washington, Idaho and Oregon.
In separate statements, Costco and Darigold said they had not been aware of any child labor issues and would investigate.
Years before Mr. Callington audited the Portland factory, Costco was warned about working conditions on Darigold supplier dairies. One adult worker in the Yakima Valley drowned in a manure lagoon. Another had her face crushed by a cow. A third lost both her legs in a feed grinding machine.
In 2018, Costco began meeting with farmworker advocates as well as representatives from Darigold and UL Solutions to draw up a framework for auditing industrial dairies. But a year later, the initiative fell apart, with Costco telling the others that the extra monitoring was not feasible. In its statement to The Times, Costco said it remains interested in "collaborative partnerships" to improve conditions on dairy farms.
A major producer, Darigold also supplies McDonald's and Nestlé and processes Safeway's house brand Lucerne. None of those corporations inspect the dairies where the milk originates. McDonald's, Nestlé and Safeway said in statements that they expect suppliers to comply with their responsible sourcing standards.
Miguel tries to keep his mind blank during the workday, but he worries that he will get hurt again. When he returned home after another shift last month, he nodded at his brother and lay down on an air mattress on the floor. The sole table in the apartment was covered with boxes of Backaid and receipts for wire transfers the brothers had sent home.
"Maybe they'll let me take some sick days next week," Miguel said.
"I hope so," his brother said. "I don't know if you're going to be able to keep going."
Also scattered on the table were letters from the state explaining how Miguel could put in a workers' compensation claim and collect benefits. Neither brother could read, though, and in any case, the letters were written in English. The last one said that the deadline to apply had passed.
Miguel said that when he got hurt, his supervisor told him not to give his real age at the hospital. In the milking warehouse, though, most everyone knew he was a minor.
There was no need to hide on the night shift. No one was coming to look for him.

UL put him on a remediation plan for about a year. (Walgreens declined to comment on the incident, but said it only rarely asks for auditors to be removed. In response to questions about the Monogram factory, the company said it had cut ties with the supplier. Monogram said it is now using stronger age-verification procedures.)
This spring, Callington flagged labor issues involving adult migrant workers at a warehouse that supplies Costco’s potatoes. The plant’s management complained that he was demanding and argumentative, and his supervisor barred him from returning. Callington believed that the supplier objected to his finding 21 violations when the previous audit had found none. UL Solutions, which still employs Callington, declined to comment on either incident.
The supervisor said Callington would have to complete a series of customer service trainings, and concluded with an inspirational quote that he attributed to the poet Maya Angelou.
“‘People will forget what you said. They will forget what you did. But they will never forget how you made them feel,’” he wrote in an email. “Keep this in mind as you are interacting with our clients during your audits.”
Night Shifts, Daytime Audits
In dozens of interviews, auditors said that sometimes their firms provide little more than a veneer of compliance for global corporations, which overstate how rigorously they review sprawling supply chains.
Auditors typically start their inspections in the morning and stay for about seven hours, even at 3,000-person factories that operate around the clock. In practice, this means that late afternoon and night shifts, where child labor violations most often occur, are almost never seen.
This year, the Department of Labor imposed a $1.5 million fine against Packers Sanitation Services, which provides cleaning crews to slaughterhouses. Investigators found that the company was employing more than 100 children, including 13-year-olds, to clean back saws and head splitters overnight.
These plants had been supplying McDonald’s and Costco for years, and the corporations required regular audits. Some of those auditors noted that there was a large night shift run by the sanitation company, but said they had not been able to observe any of the workers. One auditor who was checking a Nebraska plant for Costco’s Kirkland brand beef spoke with 20 out of 3,500 workers — as is standard in much of the industry — and left at noon, an inspection showed. In another audit at the same plant, the inspector left at 1:30 p.m.
Costco and McDonald’s said in statements that they were strengthening their auditing standards. Packers said it had improved age verification of its workers.
Even if auditors had stayed later at the plants, they might not have been able to talk privately with the migrant child workers, who largely speak Spanish or Indigenous languages of Central America. Auditing firms rarely provide interpreters.
“You’re supposed to ask another worker to translate. But you’re trying to unearth something that people aren’t trying to yell from the rooftops,” said Juanita Sanchez-Sevilla, a Spanish speaker who has been conducting audits since the 1990s, including for the leading firms Intertek and Bureau Veritas. “If you look at the upper echelons of the industry, they’re all white.”
In the absence of in-person interviews, auditors rely on paperwork. But children use forged documents. This summer, for instance, a 16-year-old from Guatemala was killed while cleaning a Mississippi slaughterhouse that supplies Chick-fil-A. His documents said he was in his 30s. In a statement, Chick-fil-A said it was reviewing how it investigates violations at plants.
Research has shown that outside audits are less conclusive than companies suggest. A 2021 analysis of 40,000 audits by a Cornell professor found that nearly half had relied on forged or dubious documents. An earlier study that explored the industry’s financial conflicts of interest found that auditors report fewer violations when factories are paying the bill.
In a statement, UL Solutions said that audits provide a snapshot for companies, which are ultimately responsible for enforcing their standards. An audit, the statement said, “cannot and does not guarantee that an audited facility is in full compliance with requirements against which it was audited, and does not confirm or certify compliance with laws.”
In the absence of thorough inspections, child workers can stay hidden for years.
In 2020, an auditor visited a snack food factory in Geneva, Illinois, to do an inspection required by the baby food giant Gerber. As it always had, Gerber’s report came back clear of child labor. The factory was also being regularly audited for the makers of Starburst and Skittles candies, Oreos and Cheez-Its. The companies behind those products said in statements that they had not seen indications of child labor in any inspections.
However, some migrant children were working on these products at the time. Among them was Efren Baldemar, who described getting the job with false identification at 14 years old. He was working from 10 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. to help support his family in Guatemala, renting space in a house of strangers.
In the mornings, he went from the factory to ninth grade and often fell asleep at his desk. The pace on the assembly lines was grueling. “If you didn’t keep up, the product would back up, and the machines would smoke,” he said.
The manufacturer, Hearthside Food Solutions, has been under federal and state investigations since the Times revealed child labor at other facilities in February. In a statement last week, the company said it “has never knowingly employed underage labor in our facilities.” It said it could not find a record of Efren working at its plant.
Plant inspections are typically scheduled weeks in advance, and auditors say they risk upsetting factories by arriving even a few minutes early.
“If you tell them when you’re showing up, they can game it,” said Doug Cahn, who created the audit system for Reebok International and now advises other corporations. “They know auditors don’t come back to see if the lights are on at the meatpacking plant at 3 a.m.”
In some cases, the Times review of audits showed, auditors certified plants as free of child labor but acknowledged in their reports that they didn’t really know if that was true.
An auditor representing Walgreens reported that there was no way to verify the ages of workers at a Chicago-area factory distributing disposable plates and cups. At the time, the factory was also supplying products for Sysco, Hefty and Walmart’s Great Value brand, according to the audit. The plant was using a staffing agency that refused to share paperwork, the auditor noted.
Hefty and Walgreens said that they have stopped using the supplier. Sysco said it did not generally audit U.S. suppliers, while Walmart declined to comment.
The staffing agency is now under a state investigation for possible child labor violations.
Nagging Questions
In his career, Callington had never found a case of migrant child labor, which would trigger an automatic failing grade. But now looking back, he suspected he had often audited plants where children were working.
Earlier this year, Callington asked managers at UL Solutions if Costco or other corporations might be willing to start requiring unannounced nighttime inspections. He pointed out news coverage that mentioned child labor raids at slaughterhouses.
“I have audited these locations and was never able to detect these issues given that we are only present for the first shift,” he wrote.
A manager said she would raise the question with higher-ups. He never heard anything more about it.
Callington sometimes squeezes in five audits a week, staying on the road for six-week stretches. He flies between coasts so regularly that he has stopped thinking of himself as having a home-base time zone, and during long drives occasionally turns to his phone to ask, “Hey, Siri, where am I?”
This fall, he found himself in Oregon looking over the supply chain for the store-brand milk sold at Costco.
A company called Darigold, which processes milk for an association of 300 Northwest dairy farms, was paying for Callington to review its Portland plant. A manager toured him around the gleaming factory, which was suffused with the sweet smell of milk.
He looked over the spinning bottling machines, but he did not ask about the dairies that supplied the milk. He had once tried to look at a sub-supplier for Costco when he wandered into a hen house at a different facility that was packing eggs. The factory complained that he had gone beyond the scope of his audit, he said.
By late afternoon, he was thanking the Portland team for their hospitality and leaving to prepare for his next inspection. He had given the milk plant a perfect score on Costco’s child labor standards: free of illegal child labor (requirement No. 140), free of children working excessive hours (No. 144) and free of instances of child labor in the past (No. 142).
But a few hours away, 17-year-old Miguel Sanchez was in the middle of his shift at a Darigold milk supplier, where he had been working 12-hour days for nearly two years.
‘No Option Except to Keep Going’
Miguel came to Washington’s Yakima Valley from Mexico to live with an older brother, and he immediately began working at an industrial dairy with fake identification that said he was an adult. It was a violation of child labor laws for him to work instead of going to school, but he had to contribute to the rent and felt pressure to support his parents back home.
“I was tired a lot when I started because you have to work really fast, but my family was proud of me,” he said.
In May, Miguel was trying to corral several dozen cows in a milking pen when a co-worker accidentally shut the gate and trapped him inside. Two cows, each weighing about half a ton, pushed him up against the metal bars.
Miguel felt the air leave his lungs and his spine start to buckle. He tried to shout, but his co-worker did not hear him over the thrum of machinery, and he began to pass out. A supervisor took him to the hospital.
Six months later, pain still radiated from his back into his legs as he ran up and down the floor of a warehouse hooking and unhooking cows from milking machines. He regularly downed an over-the-counter drug called Backaid to get through the workday, but it seemed to do less and less . Even standing had become excruciating.
“It feels like electric shocks all through my body,” he said last month. “But I have no option except to keep going. I have to make money.”
It is unclear if the milk Miguel collected ended up in the facility that Callington audited. Darigold’s milk is processed in 11 plants around the Northwest. Workers said they often saw minors in the dairies, and the Times spoke with a half-dozen children who came to the United States alone and worked full time for Darigold suppliers in Washington, Idaho and Oregon.
In separate statements, Costco and Darigold said they had not been aware of any child labor issues and would investigate.
Years before Callington audited the Portland factory, Costco was warned about working conditions on Darigold supplier dairies. One adult worker in the Yakima Valley drowned in a manure lagoon. Another had her face crushed by a cow. A third lost both her legs in a feed grinding machine.
In 2018, Costco began meeting with farmworker advocates as well as representatives from Darigold and UL Solutions to draw up a framework for auditing industrial dairies. But a year later, the initiative fell apart, with Costco telling the others that the extra monitoring was not feasible. In its statement to the Times, Costco said it remains interested in “collaborative partnerships” to improve conditions on dairy farms.
A major producer, Darigold also supplies McDonald’s and Nestlé and processes Safeway’s house brand Lucerne. None of those corporations inspect the dairies where the milk originates. McDonald’s, Nestlé and Safeway said in statements that they expect suppliers to comply with their responsible sourcing standards.
Miguel tries to keep his mind blank during the workday, but he worries that he will get hurt again. When he returned home after another shift last month, he nodded at his brother and lay down on an air mattress on the floor. The sole table in the apartment was covered with boxes of Backaid and receipts for wire transfers the brothers had sent home.
“Maybe they’ll let me take some sick days next week,” Miguel said.
“I hope so,” his brother said. “I don’t know if you’re going to be able to keep going.”
Also scattered on the table were letters from the state explaining how Miguel could put in a workers’ compensation claim and collect benefits. Neither brother could read, though, and in any case, the letters were written in English. The last one said that the deadline to apply had passed.
Miguel said that when he got hurt, his supervisor told him not to give his real age at the hospital. In the milking warehouse, though, most everyone knew he was a minor.
There was no need to hide on the night shift. No one was coming to look for him.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X," from 1986, receives its grandest treatment yet, in a production expected to play on opera stages from coast to coast.
The epigraph of Anthony Davis's opera "X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X" is a quote from an interview in which, asked about the cost of freedom, Malcolm responds, "The cost of freedom is death."
That tension -- between hope and reality, between liberation and limitation -- courses through a new production of "X" that opened at the Metropolitan Opera on Friday, in the work's company premiere. This staging dreams of a better future, with a towering Afrofuturist spaceship that, at the beginning, appears to be calling Malcolm X home. But the beam-me-up rays of light are pulled away to reveal a floating proscenium, gilded at the edges and decorated with a landscape mural. It is a replica of the podium at the Audubon Ballroom in Manhattan, where he was assassinated on Feb. 21, 1965.
As an outlook it's unsettling, but true to Malcolm X. In his autobiography, narrated to Alex Haley and posthumously published, he recounts the killing of his father and says: "It has always been my belief that I, too, will die by violence. I have done all that I can to be prepared." And since "X" premiered, in 1986, there has been only more violence, a fact lost neither on the work's creators -- Davis, following a story by his brother, Christopher Davis, and a libretto by their cousin Thulani Davis -- nor on this production's director, Robert O'Hara, who at times treats the surface of the spaceship as a memorial, projecting the names of Black victims onto it.
The list covers decades -- the Rev. George W. Lee, James Byrd Jr., Breonna Taylor, to mention just a few -- and it's an unfamiliar sight at the Met, where complex, current political realities rarely make their way onstage. But "X," Davis's first opera, has arrived there as part of a programming wave that inevitably speaks to contemporary life: After the murder of George Floyd, the Met announced that it would return from its pandemic closure with its first work by a Black composer, Terence Blanchard's "Fire Shut Up in My Bones." It wasn't long before "X" was in the pipeline, too.
"X" had its official debut next door to the Met in a New York City Opera production at what is now the David H. Koch Theater. It had the makings of a great American opera score: a breakdown of genre boundaries that restlessly flows between detailed notation and improvisation, as well as between classical and modern, homegrown styles like swing and jazz. Avant-garde idioms nestle comfortably next to tuneful pop melodies like that of "Shoot your shot!" In its subject matter, the work fits alongside so-called CNN operas like John Adams's "Nixon in China," which premiered a year later in Houston and took a similarly mythic approach to characters from recent history.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
But "Nixon" became firmly a classic, while "X" languished for decades -- revived by Oakland Opera Theater in 2006, then dormant again until O'Hara's staging of a newly revised score premiered at Detroit Opera last year. This production, thankfully, was also commissioned by Lyric Opera of Chicago, Opera Omaha and Seattle Opera. At last, "X" is set to be played from coast to coast.
In its move from Detroit to New York, "X" has been scaled to fill the Met's stage. The creative team, all in their company debuts, has made everything bigger: the spaceship, the centerpiece of Clint Ramos's scenic design; the chorus, about half in period dress and the others in Dede Ayite's spectacular Afrofuturist costumes; Yee Eun Nam's projections, almost constantly present, by turns sci-fi and documentary.
Bigger, though, in this case also means busier. (And Davis's score is busy enough.) In Detroit, four dancers complemented and accentuated the action; but now, there is a full ensemble that, in Rickey Tripp's slight choreography, distracts more than it illuminates. Still, all these elements cohere into a grand, pageantry treatment of Malcolm X's life that eschews realism for dreamy abstraction befitting the opening's oratorio-like choral incantation "We've been waiting for a prophet," and Brechtian touches that signal "X" as distinctly theatrical storytelling.
We don't hear from the adult Malcolm until the end of Act I. (Before that, he is represented by a child, Bryce Christian Thompson, who is given the achingly simple aria "Momma, help me.") But when we do, the moment is meant to arrive like a lightning bolt. On Friday, it was more of anticlimax. The orchestra, under the baton of Kazem Abdullah, who also led the Detroit run, pulled back to accommodate the small baritone sound of Will Liverman's Malcolm.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This is a role that demands charisma and titanic presence, especially as the evening progresses. In Detroit, the bass-baritone Davóne Tines commanded the stage with ease and resonant authority. (He also made an excellent recording with the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Odyssey Opera las year.) But Liverman, while passionate and warm as always, hasn't found a role he can fully inhabit.
Liverman might have had more success in a concert setting, but onstage his performance had dramatic consequences: His was a Malcolm X repeatedly overshadowed by those around him. As Malcolm's mother, Louise, and later as his wife, Betty, the soprano Leah Hawkins persuasively traced within brief, contained appearances the pained arcs of women who come to terms with the doomed lives of their partners. And the mezzo-soprano Raehann Bryce-Davis, another singer doing double duty, as Malcolm's sister Ella and Queen Mother, was a smooth-voiced source of comfort.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mighty, too, were the men surrounding Malcolm: the penetrating bass-baritone Michael Sumuel, as Reginald; and the tenor Victor Ryan Robertson, bright and assured as Street and as Elijah Muhammad -- the Black separatist and religious leader whom Malcolm X adulated before breaking from him, politically and philosophically, near the end of his life.
Supporting this cast was a chorus that performed with the kind of unevenness that tends to improve after opening night. The same could be said for the orchestra, which despite Abdullah's sure hand occasionally lapsed in its articulation but still communicated the expansive variety in Davis's score.
With a few further changes since Detroit, Davis has settled on a version of "X" with true staying power: its shifts from meditative pause to propulsive action confidently balanced, its unbroken flow from genre to genre as graceful as anything in opera. A hallmark of this music is the use of improvising instrumentalists, who follow directions both free ("respond to Malcolm") and evocative ("à la Jimmy Garrison" and "Miles Davis Funk!").
It shouldn't be taken for granted that a score with instructions like "'Bitches Brew' Miles!" should be at the Met. This was unfathomable only a few years ago. Just as history moves quickly in "X," so, too, is it beginning to in opera. Neglected for decades, this work can now be discussed with multiple casts and recordings to compare. And, with performances planned long after the run in New York, it has the opportunity to become what it always should have been: an American classic.

If You Plant Milkweed, They Will Come: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: These underappreciated plants attract a "hungry throng" of beneficial insects. They're not bad to look at, either.
To see a field of common milkweed in midsummer -- a sea of a thousand nodding pink flower heads -- you would not imagine that anything could ever stand in the way of the genus Asclepias.
Yes, common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), the most widespread milkweed east of the Rocky Mountains, can colonize disturbed sites and form impressive stands. But it is an exception among the more than 90 recognized North American species of milkweed, many of which often find it not so easy to continue making themselves at home.
"The milkweed is a displaced citizen in its own land," writes Eric Lee-Mäder in the opening of his new book, "The Milkweed Lands: An Epic Story of One Plant, Its Nature and Ecology." "Where once it owned the continent, it's now a kind of vagrant, occupying the botanical equivalent of homeless encampments."
As one example, he cites 2012 research, by John M. Pleasants of Iowa State University and Karen S. Oberhauser of the University of Minnesota, that estimates a nearly 60 percent decrease in the milkweed populations of the Midwest since 1999.
"Milkweeds, at least the North American ones, are like so many other meadow and grassland species," Mr. Lee-Mäder said in a recent conversation. "They're both dependent upon us and also subject to the various indignities of coexisting with us."
The beginnings of our agrarian legacy set much of their displacement in motion, when vast tracts of original prairie sod were plowed up to create croplands. Since the 1990s, the use of increasingly sophisticated chemical herbicides that kill everything but the crops genetically engineered to resist them has essentially "targeted milkweeds for elimination," he said.
Once, milkweed "would get shredded and pulverized by cultivation equipment, but it would spring back from the live rhizomes underground," he continued. Now, "the milkweed within those systems just dies."
We have relegated milkweed to ditches and abandoned lots, said Mr. Lee-Mäder, an ecologist at the invertebrate-focused Xerces Society, where he is the co-director of pollinator and agricultural biodiversity. He directs the nonprofit's private-sector initiatives, supporting pollinator-conservation work across thousands of acres with companies like General Mills, Nestlé and Danone, undertaking habitat restoration on farms that supply them with ingredients like almonds and blueberries.
Mr. Lee-Mäder and his wife, Mari Lee-Mäder, also operate Northwest Meadowscapes, in Port Townsend, Wash., a supplier of regional native seeds that also provides consultation services for meadow makers.
They know something that anyone who gives milkweed refuge will soon learn: If you welcome this plant, a diverse, living fan base will follow close behind -- and not only monarch butterflies.
If you plant it, they will come. Sometimes as if out of thin air.
A Two-Way Chemistry Equation
If someone says "milkweed," maybe you also hear "monarch butterfly" in your head. It's almost as if the two are inextricably linked.
Mention of this plant probably also brings to mind stories of its distinctive chemistry. Many plants defend themselves against herbivory by producing unpalatable or toxic chemicals, but "milkweeds take this strategy especially seriously," Mr. Lee-Mäder writes.
Asclepias produce potent steroids called cardenolides "that can disrupt the life functions of vertebrate animals unlucky enough to feed on them," he adds. (A bonus: These chemicals may also discourage deer.)
But while milkweeds have evolved their chemical defenses to protect themselves, they may also "be gifting these chemical defenses to some of the animals that live in association with them," Mr. Lee-Mäder said, "as much as using these to check and control the amount of herbivory that they have to sustain."
One notable example: monarchs, which have famously evolved to ingest milkweeds without harm. Their larvae rely on Asclepias as an obligate host plant, or a food required for at least one stage of development. Eating it fosters an anti-predation chemical defense of their own.
So critical is this relationship that female monarchs lay their eggs on milkweed leaves, ensuring that the needed sustenance is at hand when offspring emerge.
"They use their olfactory sense to identify the locations of milkweeds on wind currents," Mr. Lee-Mäder said, "tracking those down like bloodhounds on a trail, to be able to lay their eggs on those plants."
The monarch-milkweed connection is often spoken of as "chemical warfare," but Mr. Lee-Mäder prefers to think of it as a "two-way relationship" or "a partnership."
The monarchs' part: Although the adult butterflies are not great pollinators, they do visit milkweed flowers for nectar, potentially moving some pollinia (milkweeds' pollen-bearing structures) long distances during their migrations.
"That gene flow that monarchs may facilitate is probably unmatched by other flower visitors to milkweeds," Mr. Lee-Mäder said.
Not Just Monarchs
As intimate and celebrated as the plants' relationship with monarchs is, the community surrounding milkweeds is far more diverse.
"The hungry throng" that Mr. Lee-Mäder enumerates includes at least 40 insect species that "feed often or exclusively on North American milkweeds in the summer," he writes. They include butterflies, moths, beetles and aphids.
In a milkweed seed-farm field in the Midwest, he recalls witnessing a cloud of aphids descend on the breeze, as if tuned in by GPS to the emerging crops' location. "It's like seeing nature sort of manifest itself out of thin air around this plant," he said.
Before you say, "No, not aphids; not in my garden," think about their role in the big picture, Mr. Lee-Mäder said -- as food for beneficial insects like lady beetles and lacewing insects, for instance, which are, in turn, food for birds. And one of the most abundant milkweed-visiting aphids, the nonnative oleander aphid, is host-specific, meaning it doesn't eat other plants.
Other invertebrates, including slugs, snails and spider mites, may feast on milkweeds, too, as do some larger animals, like rabbits and ground squirrels, which are apparently resistant to poisoning.
Beyond so many opportunities for herbivory, Asclepias flowers provide nectar to adult butterflies and moths, along with an astonishing lineup of bee species and wasps.
And just look at them: Milkweeds are "among the most elaborate in the plant kingdom," he writes, with "a complexity comparable to that of rare orchids."
Which Ones to Grow?
It's easy to take delight in a stand of common milkweed or its Western counterpart, showy milkweed (A. speciosa) -- whether in bloom or later, holding their substantial seed-filled pods, or follicles. Lanky as these three- or four-footers may be, they put you "face to face with the wildness of what this genus can represent," Mr. Lee-Mäder said.
He expresses awe for rush milkweed (A. subulata), a three- to five-foot plant with whitish-green blooms that grows alongside the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) in nearly rainless parts of the desert Southwest. "It's a plant made up of stems -- it produces almost no leaves," he said, explaining its adaptation for survival.
There are other choices for gardens without a meadow-size space to offer, though, or those that aren't in the most arid places.
It's no surprise that butterfly weed (A. tuberosa), with its vivid orange flowers, has received the most horticultural attention.
"It's beautiful, it's compact, it's charismatic," Mr. Lee-Mäder said, noting also that orange is fairly uncommon among prairie and meadow flowers. Although the palette of Asclepias is generally quite different from East to West, "tuberosa is one that crosses the Continental Divide," he said, residing even in parts of the desert Southwest.
At just about two and a half feet high, a mature plant can produce "strikingly abundant blooms for the space that it takes up, and attract a really remarkable spectrum of flower visitors," he added. It is also pretty well adapted to the often highly altered soils of our human landscapes.
As its common name implies, swamp milkweed (A. incarnata), with its distinctive magenta flowers on stems of up to about four feet, can handle it wet. With rain gardens and bioswales increasingly being planted to manage more insistent runoff in a changing climate, this widespread species should get more play. Do you have a spot for it just beneath a downspout, or maybe at a pond's edge?
Another important but underappreciated species that Mr. Lee-Mäder wants to put in a word for, especially with Western gardeners, is the lavender-and-white-flowered narrowleaf milkweed (A. fascicularis), "one of the most widespread breeding plants for Western monarchs," he said.
Unlike Eastern butterfly populations, which overwinter in Mexico, Western monarchs spend the winter in coastal California and then move inland around March for breeding season. Their clusters break up and typically move straight eastward, into the Central Valley or Sierra Nevada foothills, fanning out from there.
"A monarch that wintered in Monterey might end up in Las Vegas or Boise or Spokane that next spring and summer," he said. They need more narrowleaf milkweed along their routes.
Like so many native plants, milkweeds may have persisted only on the fringes in nature, but gardeners can offer them prominent spots. A good place to begin researching which ones to choose is the Xerces Society's Project Milkweed and its region-specific plant lists.
"Planting milkweeds in a garden may be a small dent -- but it's a dent," Mr. Lee-Mäder said. "If everybody does it, it will add a different kind of richness to our landscapes."

Inspired Use Of Scissors And Bodies: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A show at the Japan Society focuses on four innovators who created a blueprint for a new society with postcards, scissors, chess sets and instructions.
Squatting over a large paper surface with a paintbrush dangling between her legs. Sitting onstage at Carnegie Hall while audience members come up to snip her clothing off with scissors. Blowing soap bubbles to make musical sounds. These are some of the actions taken in the name of art in "Out of Bounds: Japanese Women Artists in Fluxus" at the Japan Society, an exhibition that focuses on four revolutionary women, Shigeko Kubota, Takako Saito, Mieko Shiomi, and one you've probably heard of before, Yoko Ono.
Fluxus was founded in the early 1960s and paved the way for Conceptual art, Minimalism, performance and video. It saw the future in other words. Rather than create traditional paintings or sculpture, these artists did things like play games, mail postcards, cook meals and offer instructions inspired by notated musical scores. (The composer John Cage was a central figure.) There was a logic -- or anti-logic -- to this approach. Serious, "rational" society had produced mass destruction in the 20th century. Maybe novel methods of producing culture could serve as a salvo or blueprint for a new society.
But by focusing on four Japanese women, the show asks: Who stands the test of time? Who doesn't? Was Fluxus really a blueprint for the future? The exhibition, organized by Midori Yoshimoto and Tiffany Lambert, with Ayaka Iida, features around 150 objects, which range from boxes full of curious objects to videos, films and photographs.
One of the things that's obvious immediately is just how international Fluxus was -- a portent of today's much more global art world. Kubota and Shiomi moved to New York in 1964 -- partly because they felt their career prospects were limited in Japan -- and quickly became involved with Fluxus. Kubota focused on everyday activities, preparing meals and making "Flux Napkins" (c. 1967).
Kubota's infamous "Vagina Painting" (1965) was a performance in which she either attached a paintbrush to her underwear or inserted the brush into her body (the details of this are left a little unclear) and waddled over a large paper surface. The idea of "birthing" a painting and using the body in such a crudely basic way was echoed in feminist art by Ana Mendieta and Marina Abramovic, or Carolee Schneemann's "Interior Scroll" (1975), which consisted of pulling a written text out of her own vagina. In many ways, this serves as a precursor of all the bodily performance you see in the art world today.
Kubota was also a pioneering video artist. (A recent exhibition at MoMA showcased a handful of her video sculptures.) One of her works here, "Video Poem" (1970-75), features a monitor playing close-up images of her face as she nestles inside a sleeping bag. It is a sweet, somewhat sad work (the sleeping bag was her ex-boyfriend's), but not a blockbuster.
Technology and its relationship with the body was a mainstay of Fluxus, as it was for other Fluxus artists like Nam June Paik, in the postwar era. Information theory was burgeoning alongside game theory -- and games. These artists seized upon chess, a medieval war and strategy game, approaching it in an absurd, playful way, giving it exalted status.
Saito's wildly imaginative and beautifully crafted chess sets are among the best works here. Saito's "Sound Chess" from around 1977 is an interactive artwork in the form of a series of identical-looking wooden cubes containing different unknown objects (actually buttons, beans and bells). Pick them up and shake them, or attempt to play using hearing, memory and touch.
The artist's "Grinder Chess" (c. 1964) uses mechanical drill attachments as chess pieces and designs chess sets made with tiny booklets as playing pieces or a glove as a board. What does it mean to remake chess? It means, quite literally, to remake the rules of the game. And yet, chess has become popular again, on the internet and the Netflix mini-series "The Queen's Gambit" (2020). (For another take on chess in the art world, head downtown to Hamishi Farah's paintings at Maxwell Graham's gallery on the Lower East Side, where paintings of traditional black and white chess pieces are explored in a racial context.)
Mieko Shiomi came out of experimental music and improvisation, and that is her strongest suit. A projected video here shows her performing in 1961 with Group Ongaku, a Japanese noise and sound ensemble, blowing soap bubbles. (The video also includes the artist Yasunao Tone, a founding member of the Japanese section of Fluxus who will be performing at the Japan Society in conjunction with this show.)
Shiomi also created "action poems," including "Event for Late Afternoon" (1963) that consisted of lowering a violin from the top of a building to street level without making a sound. Long before the internet and its instant global connections, her "Spatial Poem" treated communication as a network. Shiomi provided participants with cards and instructions to write something on them, place them somewhere and report back to her. Then, like a social scientist, she would track and map the results. These are nice, poetic gestures, but don't carry the punch of some of the others.
And then there was Yoko Ono. Her famous "Cut Piece" performed in New York in 1965 and filmed by the Maysles Brothers, is on view here. You see Ono sitting onstage at Carnegie Hall while members of the audience come up and cut off her clothing. "Cut Piece" -- like her terrific "Grapefruit," a book of instructions and drawings that invited readers to do things like laugh, cough or scream for various durations -- has been performed by people around the world, taking on a new meaning based on the time and the setting.
Of course, Ono became best known outside the avant-garde art world as the partner of John Lennon -- and, for decades, a scapegoat for the breakup of the Beatles, which many consider to be a convenient misogynist and anti-Asian claim. On the other hand, Ono's infiltrating the Beatles might be among her best, unacknowledged performances ever. (What if Taylor Swift was showing up at art openings instead of football stadiums? That would be a game-changer.)
Peter Jackson's recent film about the making of the last Beatles album, "Let It Be" (1970), captured Ono sitting in the studio doing Fluxus-y things: painting at an easel, eating a pastry, paging through a Lennon fan magazine. As Amanda Hess observed in The New York Times, it's "as if she is staging a marathon performance piece, and in a way, she is."
The American artist David Horvitz flips this scenario with a T-shirt that reads: "John Lennon Broke Up Fluxus." This isn't 100% true: George Maciunas, the Lithuanian-born artist who was a driving force behind Fluxus, died in 1978 and the movement foundered after that. After wedding Lennon in 1969 though, Ono did become apprehensive about performing "Cut Piece" -- that is, sitting alone onstage as strangers approached her clutching scissors. (Ono's wild, proto-punk music is now considered by some to be more radical and interesting than Lennon's solo musical efforts.)
Like the Horvitz T-shirt, "Out of Bounds" offers a new way of thinking about Fluxus, placing Japanese women's contributions at the center, and white European and American men in supporting roles. With a roster of ongoing activities, the exhibition also seems to suggest that maybe Fluxus never broke up at all, but continues every time we play "Sound Chess" or follow Ono's "Grapefruit" instructions; listen to a heartbeat or the sound of the earth turning; step in all the puddles in a city or, as she suggested in "Map Piece" (1964), "Draw a map to get lost."
The current art world is characterized by biennials, art fairs and the art market. This runs counter to the ethos of Fluxus, which focused on more ephemeral gestures and less on objects of value. And yet, the whole contemporary art world runs like a giant, high-stakes game. Who is visible? Who is marketable? Who counts? Maybe, with its emphasis on randomness and chance, Fluxus predicted something it didn't even realize, and Ono & Company plotted, one canny gesture at a time, the world we live in.

In Maine, Bottled-Water Giant Upends the Rules: [Series]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Maine lawmakers tried to rein in large-scale access to the state's freshwater this year, the effort initially gained momentum. The state had just emerged from drought, and many Mainers were sympathetic to protecting their snow-fed lakes and streams.
Then a Wall Street-backed giant called BlueTriton stepped in.
BlueTriton isn't a household name, but its products are. Americans today buy more bottled water than any other packaged drink, and BlueTriton owns many of the nation's biggest brands, including Poland Spring, which is named after a natural spring in Maine that ran dry decades ago.
Maine's bill threatened BlueTriton's access to the groundwater it bottles and sells. The legislation had already gotten a majority vote on the committee and was headed toward the full Legislature, when a lobbyist for BlueTriton proposed an amendment that would gut the entire bill.
"Strike everything," starts the proposed amendment, which was written in a Word document that contained a digital signature showing that it had been created by Elizabeth M. Frazier, who represents BlueTriton and is one of the most influential lobbyists in Maine. The document was emailed by Ms. Frazier to lawmakers in the days after the committee vote.
After BlueTriton's intervention, the committee pulled the bill back. The company's actions, which haven't previously been reported, were described to The New York Times by three state legislators. The Times also reviewed several of the emails sent by Ms. Frazier as well as the Word document.
"We couldn't believe it. Their amendment strikes the entire bill," said Christopher Kessler, a Democratic state representative who represents South Portland and a committee member who voted to advance the bill. "Because all this happened behind closed doors, the public doesn't know that Poland Spring stalled the process."
His panel, the Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology, plans to meet on Wednesday to discuss the fate of the bill.
Bottlers have faced increasing scrutiny for the millions of throwaway plastic bottles they produce, the marketing message that their products are safer or healthier than tap water, and for a business model in which they buy freshwater, often at low cost, only to sell it back to the public at much higher prices.
And while the bottled-water business doesn't use nearly as much groundwater as the nation's thirstiest industries, like agriculture, the pressure on bottlers is building as awareness grows of the stress that intensive pumping can place on local water supplies. A Times investigation this year revealed that many of the aquifers that supply 90 percent of the nation's water systems are being severely depleted as overuse and global warming transform fragile ecosystems.
BlueTriton has been caught up in issues of local opposition and water use, and not only in Maine. The company also is fighting for access to water sources in numerous states, including Michigan, Colorado and others.
In response to detailed questions, BlueTriton on Monday pointed the The Times to a new page on its corporate website. "After thoughtful consideration, BlueTriton opposes the proposed legislation," the page says, because the bill "would make it unaffordable for any large-scale water purchaser, including Poland Spring, to invest in infrastructure and operations."
Ms. Frazier didn't respond to detailed questions.
Groundwater use is regulated by states, not the federal government, which means there is little national coordination, monitoring or management of a vital natural resource. Maine's bill seeks, among other things, to put a seven-year limit on contracts for large-scale freshwater pumping by corporations that ship water out of Maine, and to make the deals subject to local approval. That would block BlueTriton's current efforts to lock in contracts up to 45 years long for pumping water.
Industries and other interest groups routinely try to influence lawmaking, and there has been no suggestion that Ms. Frazier violated any rules. But it seemed "unusual procedurally" for a corporation to propose rewriting an entire bill after it had already advanced within the Legislature, said Anthony Moffa, associate professor at the University of Maine School of Law.
State senator Mark Lawrence, a Democrat who heads the committee considering the bill, said the committee would consider amendments proposed by any interested person or party. In Maine, "a lot of the legislation that's proposed is written by lobbyists, companies, different people like that," he said.
Mr. Lawrence also said that, at the same time the amendment was proposed, several members had begun to express fresh concerns that the State Legislature would be setting overly stringent curbs on contracts.
Water Clashes Nationwide
BlueTriton finds itself pitted against local water boards, environmentalists and other groups across the country.
In Colorado, environmental groups have been battling a 10-year contract that BlueTriton renewed with a semi-arid county to pump water from the Upper Arkansas River Basin, a region affected by historic drought.
In California, BlueTriton has publicly criticized and vowed to fight a cease-and-desist order issued by the state's water board to stop diverting millions of gallons of water from a spring in San Bernardino County.
In Michigan, lawmakers have proposed legislation that would close a loophole that enables BlueTriton and other commercial water users to pump water from the protected Great Lakes watershed. Known as the "bottled-water loophole," it allows for water to be used this way if it's in containers that are 5.7 gallons or less.
On its new corporate page, BlueTriton said "there is no evidence of adverse impacts to the aquifer" in Colorado, and that California's ruling "negatively impacts every water agency and farmer in California that relies on groundwater, and in doing so, indirectly harms every Californian."
BlueTriton is a major presence in Maine, drawing water from eight locations around the state. It is currently trying to lock in a new contract of up to 45 years to pump water in Lincoln a former mill town.
That would be BlueTriton's second decades-long contract in the state, the kind of deals that would run afoul of the State Legislature's proposed seven-year cap. The company's pursuit of these deals, and the uncertainties of how climate change may affect Maine's water supplies in the future, is what inspired the legislation, said Margaret M. O'Neil, the Democratic state legislator who introduced the bill.
"We're seeing our communities get locked into these contracts that are going to last, basically, the rest of my lifetime," which is too risky, she said, considering climate uncertainties.
In Lincoln, BlueTriton said, the local water district had the right to reduce or suspend sales to Poland Spring to ensure service to customers.
In 2016-17 and in 2020-22, Maine experienced significant drought, followed by wet years. The state has also started seeing what scientists call "snow drought": As winters warm because of climate change, snowpack and groundwater recharge can dwindle.
John Mullaney, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's New England Water Science Center, said that a warming climate meant Maine was likely to experience more variability, with stronger rains but also worsening drought. "The question is, what will we be able to do in 50 years," he said. "There might be changes that need to be made, including reducing groundwater extraction."
Industry groups emphasize that Maine still has ample groundwater and that bottled water accounts for only a small portion of its use compared to practices like irrigation. They also stress bottled water's value in emergencies when drinking water is disrupted.
And in Maine, BlueTriton has a powerful local ally: local water utilities, which say the revenue generated by selling water to bottlers helps keep costs down for everyone else.
"Turning away a customer that's seeking to pay money to the utility because of an alleged problem with extraction would be contrary" to ratepayers' interests, said Roger Crouse, a board member at the Maine Water Utilities Association. "If they have a contract that could be expiring in seven years, and the math doesn't work out, they're going to have to invest their money somewhere else."
Still, hydrologists warn that bottled water should not be discounted as an additional strain on aquifers and watersheds, as well as on residential wells. Last month, the United States Geological Survey began its first-ever study of how the activities of the bottled water industry result in changes to groundwater levels, spring flows and water quality. "Withdrawals, no matter what the use, influence movement of groundwater," Cheryl Dieter, a hydrologist who is leading the study, said in an interview.
The Rise of BlueTriton
BlueTriton is only the latest steward of a brand that dates back more than 150 years.
Poland Spring water was first packaged as a local elixir in the mid-1800s. It bubbled from the ground, and was bottled by the proprietors of a Maine inn.
Today, it embodies a different era.
The original spring has long since gone dry and is now encased behind glass in a mausoleum-like structure tucked behind a golf course. But BlueTriton now pumps freshwater from other locations in Maine, the bulk of it shipped out of the state under the Poland Spring label. New York is a major market.
BlueTriton itself is a creation of Wall Street. It is owned by the private equity funds One Rock Capital Partners and Metropoulos & Co., which paid $ 4.3 billion in 2021 to buy Nestlé's North American bottled-water business.
Metropolous grabbed national attention in 2013 when it acquired Hostess, the struggling maker of Twinkies. It turned around the popular sponge cake and sold the company a few years later for a gain of more than $ 2 billion after slashing costs and jobs.
Private equity firms often look for such deals, involving undervalued or distressed businesses that they can buy using borrowed money and then turn around. The purchase of Nestlé's bottled-water businesses had some of these elements.
Nestlé said at the time that it was selling because of increasing competition from lower-cost rivals, as well as environmental concerns such as difficulty reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Companies like Nestlé also faced risks to their reputation because of all the plastic waste created by disposable water bottles, which often don't get recycled.
The company's private equity roots have raised concerns. In March, the credit rating company Moody's Investors Service downgraded the BlueTriton's debt rating, citing its high debt load.
If and when BlueTriton is sold off by its investors, the county's water could end up being controlled by "a revolving door of owners," said John McGowan, a sustainable investing adviser in Chaffee County, Colorado, and member of a group that has been advocating for stricter curbs on the company, which pumps groundwater there.
In Maine, some neighbors of BlueTriton, like Natalie DiPentino, are skeptical of the company for more personal reasons.
Ms. DiPentino, who lives near Lincoln, can't prove it but wonders if pumping by Poland Spring contributed to a crisis in her home during a drought in 2017, when her well ran dry along with those of several neighbors. Her family had to haul buckets of river water to flush the toilet, she said. Stores nearby ran out of bottled water.
After learning about BlueTriton's proposed 45-year contract at its Lincoln facility, she led calls for a public hearing, arguing that deals were being cut behind closed doors and that Poland Spring would be paying too little, $ 15,000 a month, for millions of gallons of water. "You don't know how badly you need water until you don't have it in your house," she said.
The hearing she sought is now scheduled for next month.

When Maine lawmakers tried to rein in large-scale access to the state’s freshwater this year, the effort initially gained momentum. The state had just emerged from drought, and many Mainers were sympathetic to protecting their snow-fed lakes and streams.
Then a Wall Street-backed giant called BlueTriton stepped in.
BlueTriton isn’t a household name, but its products are. Americans today buy more bottled water than any other packaged drink, and BlueTriton owns many of the nation’s biggest brands, including Poland Spring, which is named after a natural spring in Maine that ran dry decades ago.
Maine’s bill threatened BlueTriton’s access to the groundwater it bottles and sells. The legislation had already gotten a majority vote on the committee and was headed toward the full Legislature, when a lobbyist for BlueTriton proposed an amendment that would gut the entire bill.
“Strike everything,” starts the proposed amendment, which was written in a Word document that contained a digital signature showing that it had been created by Elizabeth M. Frazier, who represents BlueTriton and is one of the most influential lobbyists in Maine. The document was emailed by Frazier to lawmakers in the days after the committee vote.
After BlueTriton’s intervention, the committee pulled the bill back. The company’s actions, which haven’t previously been reported, were described to The New York Times by three state legislators. The Times also reviewed several of the emails sent by Frazier as well as the Word document.
“We couldn’t believe it. Their amendment strikes the entire bill,” said state Rep. Christopher Kessler, a Democrat who represents South Portland and a committee member who voted to advance the bill. “Because all this happened behind closed doors, the public doesn’t know that Poland Spring stalled the process.”
His panel, the Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology, plans to meet on Wednesday to discuss the fate of the bill.
Bottlers have faced increasing scrutiny for the millions of throwaway plastic bottles they produce, the marketing message that their products are safer or healthier than tap water, and for a business model in which they buy freshwater, often at low cost, only to sell it back to the public at much higher prices.
And while the bottled-water business doesn’t use nearly as much groundwater as the nation’s thirstiest industries, like agriculture, the pressure on bottlers is building as awareness grows of the stress that intensive pumping can place on local water supplies. A Times investigation this year revealed that many of the aquifers that supply 90% of the nation’s water systems are being severely depleted as overuse and global warming transform fragile ecosystems.
BlueTriton has been caught up in issues of local opposition and water use, and not only in Maine. The company also is fighting for access to water sources in numerous states, including Michigan, Colorado and others.
In response to detailed questions, BlueTriton on Monday pointed the Times to a new page on its corporate website. “After thoughtful consideration, BlueTriton opposes the proposed legislation,” the page says, because the bill “would make it unaffordable for any large-scale water purchaser, including Poland Spring, to invest in infrastructure and operations.”
Frazier didn’t respond to detailed questions.
Groundwater use is regulated by states, not the federal government, which means there is little national coordination, monitoring or management of a vital natural resource. Maine’s bill seeks, among other things, to put a seven-year limit on contracts for large-scale freshwater pumping by corporations that ship water out of Maine, and to make the deals subject to local approval. That would block BlueTriton’s current efforts to lock in contracts up to 45 years long for pumping water.
Industries and other interest groups routinely try to influence lawmaking, and there has been no suggestion that Frazier violated any rules. But it seemed “unusual procedurally” for a corporation to propose rewriting an entire bill after it had already advanced within the Legislature, said Anthony Moffa, associate professor at the University of Maine School of Law.
State Sen. Mark Lawrence, a Democrat who heads the committee considering the bill, said the committee would consider amendments proposed by any interested person or party. In Maine, “a lot of the legislation that’s proposed is written by lobbyists, companies, different people like that,” he said.
Lawrence also said that, at the same time the amendment was proposed, several members had begun to express fresh concerns that the state Legislature would be setting overly stringent curbs on contracts.
Water Clashes Nationwide
BlueTriton finds itself pitted against local water boards, environmentalists and other groups across the country.
In Colorado, environmental groups have been battling a 10-year contract that BlueTriton renewed with a semi-arid county to pump water from the Upper Arkansas River Basin, a region affected by historic drought.
In California, BlueTriton has publicly criticized and vowed to fight a cease-and-desist order issued by the state’s water board to stop diverting millions of gallons of water from a spring in San Bernardino County.
In Michigan, lawmakers have proposed legislation that would close a loophole that enables BlueTriton and other commercial water users to pump water from the protected Great Lakes watershed. Known as the “bottled-water loophole,” it allows for water to be used this way if it’s in containers that are 5.7 gallons or less.
On its new corporate page, BlueTriton said “there is no evidence of adverse impacts to the aquifer” in Colorado, and that California’s ruling “negatively impacts every water agency and farmer in California that relies on groundwater, and in doing so, indirectly harms every Californian.”
BlueTriton is a major presence in Maine, drawing water from eight locations around the state. It is currently trying to lock in a new contract of up to 45 years to pump water in Lincoln a former mill town.
That would be BlueTriton’s second decades-long contract in the state, the kind of deals that would run afoul of the state Legislature’s proposed seven-year cap. The company’s pursuit of these deals, and the uncertainties of how climate change may affect Maine’s water supplies in the future, is what inspired the legislation, said Margaret M. O’Neil, the Democratic state legislator who introduced the bill.
“We’re seeing our communities get locked into these contracts that are going to last, basically, the rest of my lifetime,” which is too risky, she said, considering climate uncertainties.
In Lincoln, BlueTriton said, the local water district had the right to reduce or suspend sales to Poland Spring to ensure service to customers.
In 2016-17 and in 2020-22, Maine experienced significant drought, followed by wet years. The state has also started seeing what scientists call “snow drought”: As winters warm because of climate change, snowpack and groundwater recharge can dwindle.
John Mullaney, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey’s New England Water Science Center, said that a warming climate meant Maine was likely to experience more variability, with stronger rains but also worsening drought. “The question is, what will we be able to do in 50 years,” he said. “There might be changes that need to be made, including reducing groundwater extraction.”
Industry groups emphasize that Maine still has ample groundwater and that bottled water accounts for only a small portion of its use compared to practices like irrigation. They also stress bottled water’s value in emergencies when drinking water is disrupted.
And in Maine, BlueTriton has a powerful local ally: local water utilities, which say the revenue generated by selling water to bottlers helps keep costs down for everyone else.
“Turning away a customer that’s seeking to pay money to the utility because of an alleged problem with extraction would be contrary” to ratepayers’ interests, said Roger Crouse, a board member at the Maine Water Utilities Association. “If they have a contract that could be expiring in seven years, and the math doesn’t work out, they’re going to have to invest their money somewhere else.”
Still, hydrologists warn that bottled water should not be discounted as an additional strain on aquifers and watersheds, as well as on residential wells. Last month, the U.S. Geological Survey began its first-ever study of how the activities of the bottled water industry result in changes to groundwater levels, spring flows and water quality. “Withdrawals, no matter what the use, influence movement of groundwater,” Cheryl Dieter, a hydrologist who is leading the study, said in an interview.

American Airlines Loss
Is Tied to Labor Costs
American Airlines posted a $ 545 million loss for the third quarter as revenue was flat last summer and costs rose, especially to cover a new contract with its pilots.
American cut its full-year earnings forecast to $ 2.25 to $ 2.50 a share, from $ 3 to $ 3.75 a share.
The results announced Thursday contrasted with those of American's two closest rivals. United Airlines and Delta Air Lines. Both reported rising revenue and profit of $ 1.1 billion for the quarter, which covers much of the peak vacation-travel season.
Revenue of $ 13.48 billion was slightly below Wall Street forecasts and flat with last summer. By contrast, United and Delta reported revenue gains of 12 percent and 11 percent.
American's third-quarter loss compared with a profit of $ 483 million in the same quarter last year. The airline cited $ 983 million in charges for contract-ratification bonuses paid to pilots in August. ASSOCIATED PRESS
REAL ESTATE
Home Sales Fall Again,
Hurt by Rates and Prices
Sales of previously occupied homes in September fell for the fourth month in a row, their slowest pace in more than a decade, as prospective home buyers grapple with surging mortgage rates and sparse properties on the market.
Existing home sales fell 2 percent last month from August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. It was the slowest sales pace since October 2010.
Sales sank 15.4 percent compared with the same month last year and are down 21 percent through the first nine months of the year versus last year.
Home prices kept climbing, though. The national median sales price rose 2.8 percent from September last year to $ 394,300. The weekly average rate on a 30-year mortgage surged this week to 7.63 percent, the highest since 2000, according to the mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. ASSOCIATED PRESS
EARNINGS
Nestlé's Retail Increases
Result in Missed Estimates
Nestlé posted lower-than-expected nine-month sales growth on Thursday as higher product prices made shoppers balk, but said it expected volumes to turn positive again by year-end.
Organic sales, which exclude the impact of currency movement and acquisitions, rose 7.8 percent in the first nine months of 2023, Nestlé said. Analysts had on average expected 8.1 percent growth.
Nestlé's 8.4 percent increases in prices over the period was below the average analyst estimate of 8.6 percent. Real internal growth -- a measure of sales volumes -- fell 0.6 percent, meeting expectations.
Mark Schneider, Nestlé's chief, said he had "confidence that real internal growth, the sum of volume and mix, will turn positive in the second half of the year and again become the main driver of growth going forward."
"Pricing will be more targeted, by brand and by country," Mr. Schneider said. REUTERS

Ban on Red Food Dye Hasn't Halted Its Use In Cookies and Candy: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The dye was banned in cosmetics after a study suggested it might be a carcinogen. Yet federal regulations still permit its use in foods, stoking concerns that helped build support for the new state law.
Thirty-three years after the Food and Drug Administration banned the use of Red Dye No. 3 in red lipstick and other cosmetics by linking it to cancer, California has become the first state to ban the chemical in food.
Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed a law this month that outlawed the red dye and three other chemicals. Red No. 3 is used in Halloween treats and other foods, including private-label candy, cookies and frostings sold at national chains such as Walmart and Target.
The California law increases public pressure on the F.D.A. to examine similar questions surrounding artificial colors and other ingredients. But the agency itself is in a state of flux after the infant formula scandal raised concerns about food oversight. Dr. Robert Califf, the F.D.A. commissioner, has begun a reorganization of its beleaguered food division, marked by the departure of two top officials and the appointment of a deputy commissioner with significant experience in food safety.
Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat who represents a district near Los Angeles, said the federal agency's inaction along with loopholes in food safety regulations had contributed to the state lawmakers' reasoning in supporting the measure.
"The primary purpose of this bill was to protect kids and families and consumers in the state of California," he said. "But a secondary purpose here was to send a message to Washington that the F.D.A. process is broken, and hopefully to spur momentum in Washington D.C. for real, significant change."
The F.D.A. said in a statement that it "evaluates and regulates ingredients added to food to ensure that the authorized use of these ingredients is safe. This includes the four ingredients included in the California bill."
The California law applies to food chemicals that are also banned in the European Union and in some other nations. The red dye is still permitted for use in maraschino cherries.
First approved for use in food in 1907, Red Dye No. 3 was banned in cosmetics by U.S. regulators in 1990. At the time, the F.D.A. cited an industry-conducted study that found that the chemical caused thyroid cancer in male rats (but not mice) but estimated that it might cause cancer in fewer than 1 in 100,000 people. Along with prohibiting the dye in cosmetics, the agency pledged to do the same with food.
"We're stuck in this regulatory quandary where you're not allowed to apply it to your skin, but you can ingest it in food -- so it's completely illogical," said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, which signed the petition and supported the California bill.
In the ensuing decades, though, the red dye became a common coloring agent in candies and frosting. Last year, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, along with other advocacy groups, petitioned the F.D.A. to take action against it. The F.D.A. said it is reviewing the petition and has examined the safety of the dye, including the rat studies, which it said are "not relevant to human cancer."
The petition also cited a California study in 2021 that linked Red Dye No. 3 and other dyes to behavioral problems in some children.
At a grocery store in northern New Jersey, examples could be found of foods that included Red Dye No. 3; Nestle's strawberry Nesquik drink and the strawberry-flavored Funfetti Mermaid frosting, made by General Mills's Pillsbury. The synthetic coloring agent is also found in cookies, fruit cocktail cups and sprinkles for treats sold under private labels at Target and Walmart, according to a food database maintained by the U.S. Agriculture Department. Nestle, General Mills, and Walmart did not respond to emails seeking comment. Target said in a statement that it requires its vendors to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws.
Some companies said they were working to remove Red Dye No. 3 from their products. Just Born, which makes Peeps, the squishy marshmallow candy, said only two colors -- pink and lavender Peeps -- would be made using the dye in 2024. After next spring, the dye would be phased out of all of its products, the company said.
"We have worked hard to develop new formulations," Keith Domalewski, director of marketing at Just Born, said in an email.
He added that another popular treat, Hot Tamales, was no longer made with Red Dye No. 3 and that updated ingredient lists should soon be on store shelves nationwide.
The California legislation also banned brominated vegetable oil, which is mostly used in store-brand sodas to keep citrus flavoring from floating to the top. An F.D.A. study in 2022 found that the ingredient may disrupt hormones in rats. The agency has said it plans to ban the ingredient.
The state law, which takes effect in 2027, also outlaws potassium bromate, used in baked goods and tortillas. It has been deemed a possible human carcinogen by international experts, also based on animal studies. Propylparaben, also banned under the law, is a preservative in packaged baked goods that is believed to disrupt hormones and affect reproductive health.
The back story of chemicals like propylparaben propelled the bill forward, according to Susan Little, a California-based lobbyist for the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that supported the legislation. The chemical, in F.D.A. parlance, was "generally recognized as safe," or GRAS, a designation that was initially assigned to ingredients like salt and vinegar, which were deemed permissible foods and chemicals with no in-depth review.
Acknowledging a cumbersome review process, the F.D.A. in 1997 allowed food companies to convene experts internally to certify some ingredients as safe. Companies could add them to food without any special notice to the public or the F.D.A., according to Jensen N. Jose, a lawyer with the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
"Many people were astounded to learn that the F.D.A. is not actively regulating the chemicals we put in our food," Ms. Little said. "That piece of information came as a surprise to many people and was a reason the bill had the legs it had."
Opposition to the California legislation was fierce for many months, but diminished when the sponsors dropped the part of the proposal that would have banned titanium dioxide, a chemical used to color food white or add a shiny appearance. The European Union banned the ingredient last year, saying it was uncertain whether the ingredient's minuscule nanoparticles damaged DNA. The F.D.A. is reviewing a second petition seeking to remove that ingredient from food.
In California, the National Confectioners Association was among the food industry groups opposed to the bill, saying it would generate "a patchwork of inconsistent state requirements."
"We should be relying on the scientific rigor of the F.D.A. in terms of evaluating the safety of food ingredients and additives," Christopher Gindlesperger, an association vice president, said.
Frank Yiannas, a former top F.D.A. food official, said after his resignation early this year that he had since consulted for groups that "directly or indirectly have an interest in this topic." He wrote an opinion article opposing the bill in September. On Thursday, he said that the California law "sets a dangerous precedent" in taking on a food-oversight role better performed by federal experts.
"I don't think it adequately considered the longer-term, unintended consequences it could have on the U.S. food system," said Mr. Yiannas, who was a Walmart food safety executive before joining the F.D.A. in 2018.
As the California bill and a pending measure in New York State aimed at eliminating titanium dioxide drew attention, Dr. Califf addressed the F.D.A.'s moves on food safety in May: "The F.D.A. is embarking on a more modernized, systematic reassessment of chemicals with a focus on post-market review."
He also appealed to Congress for more funding and oversight powers to accomplish those goals. Since then, the F.D.A. has named James Jones to lead its food division, noting his experience as a pesticide regulator at the Environmental Protection Agency.
Nearly 10 years ago, Mars, Kellogg's and General Mills pledged to remove synthetic colors from popular snacks and cereals, many of which are geared toward children.
But within a couple of years, many of the companies had reversed their decisions. General Mills said sales of its Trix cereal, appearing in more muted colors thanks to vegetable and fruit juices and other ingredients, initially exceeded expectations. But the company soon backpedaled, saying loyal customers were split, with some preferring brightly colored cereal made with artificial colors. WK Kellogg, a spinoff of Kellogg's cereal business, did not respond to queries seeking comment.
In a statement, Mars said after research it had found that, "consumer expectations regarding colors in food differ widely across markets and categories."
In grocery store aisles, a vast majority of red-hued beverages and treats, including Skittles, cherry Pop-Tarts, Fruity Pebbles cereal and strawberry Pedialyte, are made with Red Dye No. 40, another synthetic coloring.
The dye, also known as Allura Red, has also drawn scrutiny over the years. Some studies and researchers have linked the dye to hyperactivity in children, but a committee convened by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2011 found no "causal link." Late last year, another study in mice raised concerns that Allura Red dye could increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
Supporters of the California measure said they hoped the F.D.A. and others would focus more on such additives and on overall food chemical oversight in the coming months.
"This regulatory system couldn't get any better for the food industry and companies that sell chemicals to the food industry," said Scott Faber, director of the Environmental Working Group.

California’s Ban on Red Food Dye Puts FDA’s Food Policies on the Spot

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Thirty-three years after the Food and Drug Administration banned the use of Red Dye No. 3 in red lipstick and other cosmetics by linking it to cancer, California has become the first state to ban the chemical in food.
Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed a law this month that outlawed the red dye and three other chemicals. Red No. 3 is used in Halloween treats and other foods, including private-label candy, cookies and frostings sold at national chains such as Walmart and Target.
The California law increases public pressure on the FDA to examine similar questions surrounding artificial colors and other ingredients. But the agency itself is in a state of flux after the infant formula scandal raised concerns about food oversight. Dr. Robert Califf, the FDA commissioner, has begun a reorganization of its beleaguered food division, marked by the departure of two top officials and the appointment of a deputy commissioner with significant experience in food safety.
Assembly member Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat who represents a district near Los Angeles, said the federal agency’s inaction along with loopholes in food safety regulations had contributed to the state lawmakers’ reasoning in supporting the measure.
“The primary purpose of this bill was to protect kids and families and consumers in the state of California,” he said. “But a secondary purpose here was to send a message to Washington that the FDA process is broken, and hopefully to spur momentum in Washington, D.C., for real, significant change.”
The FDA said in a statement that it “evaluates and regulates ingredients added to food to ensure that the authorized use of these ingredients is safe. This includes the four ingredients included in the California bill.”
The California law applies to food chemicals that are also banned in the European Union and in some other nations. The red dye is still permitted for use in maraschino cherries.
First approved for use in food in 1907, Red Dye No. 3 was banned in cosmetics by U.S. regulators in 1990. At the time, the FDA cited an industry-conducted study that found that the chemical caused thyroid cancer in male rats (but not mice), but estimated that it might cause cancer in fewer than 1 in 100,000 people. Along with prohibiting the dye in cosmetics, the agency pledged to do the same with food.
“We’re stuck in this regulatory quandary where you’re not allowed to apply it to your skin, but you can ingest it in food — so it’s completely illogical,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, which signed the petition and supported the California bill.
In the ensuing decades, though, the red dye became a common coloring agent in candies and frosting. Last year, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, along with other advocacy groups, petitioned the FDA to take action against it. The FDA said it is reviewing the petition and has examined the safety of the dye, including the rat studies, which it said are “not relevant to human cancer.”
The petition also cited a California study in 2021 that linked Red Dye No. 3 and other dyes to behavioral problems in some children.
At a grocery store in northern New Jersey, examples could be found of foods that included Red Dye No. 3; Nestle’s strawberry Nesquik drink and the strawberry-flavored Funfetti Mermaid frosting, made by General Mills’ Pillsbury. The synthetic coloring agent is also found in cookies, fruit cocktail cups, and sprinkles for treats sold under private labels at Target and Walmart, according to a food database maintained by the U.S. Agriculture Department. Nestle, General Mills, and Walmart did not respond to emails seeking comment. Target said in a statement that it requires its vendors to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws.
Some companies said they were working to remove Red Dye No. 3 from their products. Just Born, which makes Peeps, the squishy marshmallow candy, said only two colors — pink and lavender Peeps — would be made using the dye in 2024. After next spring, the dye would be phased out of all of its products, the company said.
“We have worked hard to develop new formulations,” Keith Domalewski, director of marketing at Just Born, said in an email.
He added that another popular treat, Hot Tamales, was no longer made with Red Dye No. 3 and that updated ingredient lists should soon be on store shelves nationwide.
The California legislation also banned brominated vegetable oil, which is mostly used in store-brand sodas to keep citrus flavoring from floating to the top. An FDA study in 2022 found that the ingredient may disrupt hormones in rats. The agency has said it plans to ban the ingredient.
The state law, which takes effect in 2027, also outlaws potassium bromate, used in baked goods and tortillas. It has been deemed a possible human carcinogen by international experts, also based on animal studies. Propylparaben, also banned under the law, is a preservative in packaged baked goods that is believed to disrupt hormones and affect reproductive health.
The backstory of chemicals like propylparaben propelled the bill forward, according to Susan Little, a California-based lobbyist for the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that supported the legislation. The chemical, in FDA parlance, was “generally recognized as safe,” or GRAS, a designation that was initially assigned to ingredients like salt and vinegar, which were deemed permissible foods and chemicals with no in-depth review.
Acknowledging a cumbersome review process, the FDA in 1997 allowed food companies to convene experts internally to certify some ingredients as safe. Companies could add them to food without any special notice to the public or the FDA, according to Jensen N. Jose, a lawyer with the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
“Many people were astounded to learn that the FDA is not actively regulating the chemicals we put in our food,” Little said. “That piece of information came as a surprise to many people and was a reason the bill had the legs it had.”
Opposition to the California legislation was fierce for many months but diminished when the sponsors dropped the part of the proposal that would have banned titanium dioxide, a chemical used to color food white or add a shiny appearance. The EU banned the ingredient last year, saying it was uncertain whether the ingredient’s minuscule nanoparticles damaged DNA. The FDA is reviewing a second petition seeking to remove that ingredient from food.
In California, the National Confectioners Association was among the food industry groups opposed to the bill, saying it would generate “a patchwork of inconsistent state requirements.”
“We should be relying on the scientific rigor of the FDA in terms of evaluating the safety of food ingredients and additives,” Christopher Gindlesperger, an association vice president, said.
Frank Yiannas, a former top FDA food official, said after his resignation early this year that he had since consulted for groups that “directly or indirectly have an interest in this topic.” He wrote an opinion article opposing the bill in September. On Thursday, he said that the California law “sets a dangerous precedent” in taking on a food-oversight role better performed by federal experts.
“I don’t think it adequately considered the longer-term, unintended consequences it could have on the U.S. food system,” said Yiannas, who was a Walmart food safety executive before joining the FDA in 2018.
As the California bill and a pending measure in New York state aimed at eliminating titanium dioxide drew attention, Califf addressed the FDA’s moves on food safety in May: “The FDA is embarking on a more modernized, systematic reassessment of chemicals with a focus on post-market review.”
He also appealed to Congress for more funding and oversight powers to accomplish those goals. Since then, the FDA has named James Jones to lead its food division, noting his experience as a pesticide regulator at the Environmental Protection Agency.
Nearly 10 years ago, Mars, Kellogg’s and General Mills pledged to remove synthetic colors from popular snacks and cereals, many of which are geared toward children.
But within a couple of years, many of the companies had reversed their decisions. General Mills said sales of its Trix cereal, appearing in more muted colors thanks to vegetable and fruit juices and other ingredients, initially exceeded expectations.

Conflicts In Dietary Guidelines: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The process of updating the healthy eating recommendations has become more transparent in recent years, but conflicts persist.
It is a long-running concern of government watchdogs: Some of the experts responsible for helping to craft the U.S. dietary guidelines also take money from big food and drug companies.
A report published Wednesday by the nonprofit U.S. Right to Know makes those concerns plain. Nine of the 20 experts on the 2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee have had conflicts of interest in the food, beverage, pharmaceutical or weight loss industries in the last five years, the report found.
Gary Ruskin, the executive director of the nonprofit, said the finding "erodes confidence in the dietary guidelines," which provide recommendations on how people can eat a healthier diet. The guidelines are widely used by policymakers to set priorities in federal food programs, health care and education -- and questions about industry influence could damage the public's trust that the recommendations are based in science rather than reflecting corporate interests, Mr. Ruskin said.
What the new report found
For the report, Mr. Ruskin and his colleagues scoured publicly available records and identified financial relationships with industry groups and for-profit food and pharmaceutical companies. Those relationships included research funding from infant formula companies, the U.S. Egg Nutrition Center and the California Walnut Commission; paid consulting positions with companies that manufacture weight loss drugs; and advisory board roles at WeightWatchers and the National Dairy Council.
One committee member, for example, received a $ 240,000 grant from Eli Lilly, one of the top insulin manufacturers, to research better ways for diabetes patients to manage their blood sugar through their diets.
The current committee members have far fewer industry ties than those in years past, said Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University who served on the 1995 committee and is a frequent critic of the guidelines.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services, which jointly revise the dietary guidelines every five years, appointed the current committee members. The members reported their financial disclosures to the agencies, who released a combined list of conflicts for the group -- but not for individuals -- in June.
Why conflicts of interest are a concern
When committee members receive funding from certain industry groups or organizations, it raises the concern that they may be biased toward them, Dr. Nestle said. "Part of the problem is the influence is unconscious," she said. "People don't recognize it," she added, and will often deny it.
Even if such relationships do not influence the experts, Mr. Ruskin said, they can create the appearance that they do -- which can seed doubt about how independent the committee's recommendations actually are.
Christopher Gardner, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and a current member of the dietary guidelines committee, said it would be difficult to find enough nutrition experts for the 20-member committee who had not taken money from industry groups. Federal funding for nutrition research is limited, he said, and many researchers accept industry grants for research studies so they can keep their jobs in academia. "We have to publish or perish," Dr. Gardner said.
The Right to Know report identified one major conflict of interest for Dr. Gardner: a research grant from Beyond Meat, which makes plant-based meat alternatives.
Despite that conflict, Dr. Gardner said he believed he could remain objective in his committee duties, which will include reviewing the relationship between what people eat and the risk of various diseases. And, he said, the way the committee evaluates questions of diet and health, including by rigorously reviewing scientific evidence and holding committee discussions and public meetings, would prevent one person's bias from swaying the committee's decisions.
"I have full faith that this group is going to very objectively consider all the evidence for every question," he said.
Even with significant conflicts among members of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, Dr. Nestle said they did a "pretty good job" of evaluating the evidence. Yet industry influence can still creep in later in the process, she said, when the U.S.D.A. and the H.H.S. produce the final guidelines based on the committee's advice. The 2020 guidelines, for example, disregarded the committee's recommendation for stricter limits on sugar and alcohol. And the 2015 edition omitted the committee's advice on limiting the consumption of red and processed meats after intense lobbying by the meat industry.
Why the Dietary Guidelines are important
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans influence federal policies and food programs, physician guidance and how nutrition is taught in schools. They are also used for meal planning in schools, the military, prisons and hospitals.
"You can't overestimate how important they are," Dr. Nestle said.
The current committee is evaluating the research on a number of issues, including on the health effects of ultraprocessed foods, which include most packaged foods and drinks.
That is a topic Dr. Nestle said she would follow with interest, given her concerns that the foods are harmful to people's health.

Terrines Made for the Upper Crust
Pâté en croûte, the centuries-old French dish composed of meat terrine baked in savory pastry, was first developed out of economy as a way to preserve and use up bits of offal. But today, with skilled kitchen staffs in short supply, the labor-intensive delicacy -- which requires multiple days of confiting, jellying, laminating and simmering -- feels like a luxury item. "I like the technical aspect of it," says the chef Nicolas Delaroque, 42, who serves a classic rabbit-and-tarragon version modernized with a little less fat and a bit more spice at his restaurant, Maison Nico, in San Francisco. Markus Glocker, 42, of New York's Koloman, likewise set out to create a lighter take on the original. "You're not going to feel like you just ate a stone," he says of his salmon en croûte, in which slices of tramezzini, a fluffy Italian bread, are wrapped around a rare salmon filet slicked with scallop-and-parsley mousse and topped with gherkins and a beet-infused butter. At Melbourne, Australia's Aru, the pâté en croûte is reminiscent of a fancy bánh mì. Chả lua, a ground Vietnamese pork loaf, is combined with chicken liver pâté for the filling, and the jelly layer between the meat and the pastry is seasoned with rice vinegar, soy sauce and Maggi, an MSG-spiked seasoning. "It's quite a humbling experience," says the charcutier George Jephson, 39, of assembling his iteration, which is stuffed with pork belly, confit pork tongue, crisped chicken skin, pistachios and port jelly, and can be found at his East London wine bar, Cadet, and at nearby restaurants, including Chiltern Firehouse. Still, making use of the whole pig, he says, is worth the effort. "I worked 10 years as a butcher, and we didn't sell a single piece of pork liver," he says. "Now I sell 60 kilos a week." -- Lauren Joseph
The Thing: A Geometric, Globe-Trotting Collar from Bulgari
Lately, haute joaillerie designers have been practicing their own version of democracy, combining stones of all sorts -- from ancient and rare specimens to faceted minerals only recently extracted from the earth -- without regard to hierarchy. Thus, a single bedazzled collar like this geometric one in shades of rose from the Italian jewelry house Bulgari can be seen both as an object of beauty and a primer on how gems emerge from and reflect history. Bits of reddish-orange coral, used for eons as decorative amulets in classical and Indigenous cultures, are interspersed with large cushion-cut pink tourmalines, stones initially documented in 1890 in the mines of San Diego. A lattice of oval and pavé diamonds provides the necklace's Art Deco-inspired pattern, but it's the iridescent glow of some semiprecious newcomers -- a half-dozen violet-hued kunzites, named after the American mineralogist George Frederick Kunz, who certified the gem in 1902 -- that really steals the spotlight.

A Paris Chateau with 19th-Century Influences
The 37-room Château des Fleurs, right off the Champs-Élysées in Paris's Eighth Arrondissement, takes its name from a nearby garden that served as an open-air ballroom in the 19th century. The garden is long gone, but the hotel draws much of its aesthetic inspiration from that same period: botanical stained-glass window panels, fringed velvet chairs and wrought-iron balconies. Its designers, Benito Escat and Pol Castells of the Barcelona, Spain-based studio Quintana Partners, were just as influenced by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí, incorporating his vivid colors and curved lines. Quintana designed most of the furnishings, from the velvet headboards and ruby red bathroom tiles in the guest rooms to the spherical sconces illuminating the small subterranean spa, rendering many of them from upcycled materials. The restaurant is something of a surprise, too. The Korean-born chef Ji-Hye Park transplanted her restaurant, Oma, from the Ninth Arrondissement to Château des Fleurs's ground floor, where she continues to offer dishes such as mulhué, a spicy seafood main course made with raw sea bass, sea snails and white cabbage. "We're bringing something new to the neighborhood," says Park. "It's a new chapter, a new challenge." From about $ 434 a night, chateaudesfleurs.paris. -- Lindsey Tramuta

Another Thing: An Abstract Filippo Carandini Cabinet
In recent years, collectors have come to regard one-of-a-kind design objects and lighting with the reverence once reserved for sculpture and painting. Now, the Italian designer Filippo Carandini, known for his minimalist, brightly hued interiors and products, is making a cabinet that actually resembles an abstract canvas. Further scrambling the distinction between art and craft, it's part of the new Nilufar Open Edition collection, the first time the Milan-based gallery is producing furniture in nonlimited quantities. Beginning with a six-foot-tall hinged frame constructed by local artisans, Carandini layers on impressionistic slashes of vivid acrylic paint (although there are a few basic color combinations, including this version in saturated jewel tones, no two armoires will be the same). After the piece dries, he sends it to a specialized lacquer shop for a hand-sanded, ultra-high-gloss finish. "If people wind up liking this, I don't know exactly how I'll keep up painting each one," he says. "But I'll worry about that later."

An Artist's Masterwork Made Out of Chocolate: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A rich perfume wafts through the sixth floor of the Museum of Modern Art, where the installation of Ed Ruscha's full-dress survey "Now Then" is underway. You sense it before you see it: a room where the white walls are turning velvety brown. A chocolate room.
The McPherson family, dressed in their La Paloma Fine Arts company T-shirts, bustle around their rig. Edan McPherson dips a long squeegee into a pool of melted chocolate, draws the rubber blade across the coarse mesh. His son, Daniel, whisks the prints away, while his sister Robyn feeds fresh paper. His wife, Lynda, and daughter, Kayla, monitor double boilers of chocolate in reserve. The drying racks fill up, two tenths of a pound of dark chocolate coating each sheet. When the chocolate sets, they'll trim and hang each print, floor to ceiling, like shingles on a Craftsman house.
"Chocolate Room" is an oddity in Ruscha's influential oeuvre. Of the 85-year-old Nebraska native's hundreds of projects -- paintings, prints, and photo books; dry eulogies of Americana like SPAM cans and Mobil stations and two-lane blacktop -- "Chocolate Room" is his only installation. It's been shown just seven times since its creation in 1970, and never before in New York.
Yet for all that, "Chocolate Room" is a remarkable distillation of Ruscha's sensibility: chalky humor, sweet gumption, American bleakness, an existentialism that rests on objects of pop culture, like common chocolate.
Christophe Cherix, MoMA's chief curator of prints and drawings, called it "almost mythical. You read about it, you hear about the insects, the smell."
"Chocolate Room" might have remained a legend, but in 1995 the curators Ann Goldstein and Anne Rorimer featured it in a survey of conceptual art at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. The museum acquired "Chocolate Room" in 2003.
"I do think we surprised Ed with our proposal to remake the work," Goldstein, now the deputy director of modern and contemporary art at the Art Institute in Chicago, said over email. They saw the piece as "a union of painting and conceptual art."
Cherix agrees. In the MoMA show's floor plan, "Chocolate Room" is crucial, connecting Ruscha's 1960s pop-art paintings and conceptual books to his prints and drawings in unusual materials like gunpowder and tobacco. Like taste, "Language comes from the mouth," pointed out Michael Govan, director of Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where the show travels next and where "Chocolate Room" will be remade again. He said "Chocolate Room" was the first piece he and Cherix chose.
For his part, Ruscha seems charmed by the resonance of that wholesome, elegant gesture -- wallpaper a room with chocolate. "It's locked into itself," he told me. "I'm not sure where it took me, I'm not sure I learned anything from it. It's just, you know, what it is."
At the end of March, while La Paloma were still fine-tuning the production, I met Ruscha in MoMA's Drawings and Prints Study Center. Museum staff had set out examples of his work -- including a spare leaf from the original "Chocolate Room," tan with age. The cornflower stripes on his western-style shirt set off his irises.
In 1970, the curator Henry Hopkins invited 47 artists to the United States Pavilion for the 35th Venice Biennale. More than half withdrew in protest of the Vietnam War. Hopkins set a room aside for rotating printmaking projects, and Ruscha's was first.
The way he tells it, "Chocolate Room" was "very much ad hoc. I was on the plane to Venice, and I said, good Lord, what am I going do?" Ruscha is the modest kind of genius.
"I was a little bit tired of making conventional pictures," he said, "and so I thought I would use unconventional materials." The previous year he'd made the "Stains" portfolio -- paper daubed with everything from Los Angeles tap water to the artist's blood. In London, he'd been working on "News, Mews, Pews, Brews, Stews & Dues," six words in gothic font printed with organic substances like axle grease and pie filling. (These series bracket "Chocolate Room" at MoMA.) The background of "Pews" was a mix of coffee and Hershey's syrup.
"Chocolate has a way of laying itself out, almost like an ink," Ruscha told me. "And I thought, well, I'll do the same thing, and I'll avoid making any pictorial statement and make what amount to shingles on a wall."
So Ruscha and the dealer Brooke Alexander gathered up every tube of Nestlé chocolate paste they could find. The master printer William Weege was stationed in the Pavilion, and he and Ruscha ran the syrup through the silk-screen press, onto deluxe, handmade Fabriano paper. They trimmed the edges and tacked up the sheets four high.
"Chocolate Room" was playful and abstract, evocative in the way of scents -- and slightly brutal, a fragrant blank. Ants marched in. Visitors drew peace signs and antiwar slogans with their fingers.
"I remember not being too insulted by it," said Ruscha. "I'd prefer that nobody graffiti that thing here," at MoMA, he added, "but, you know, it's possible." Not to mistake his ease for apathy, but Ruscha seems to embrace contingencies. Certain parameters are fixed, others wild. "It's like a quiet fun house," he said.
Of the MoMA version, Cherix said: "We want to preserve the presentation as much as we can." But when I talked to Ed about that, he couldn't care less."
Cherix laughed. "He said, well, the work changes, chocolate changes color, that's what it is."
Indeed.
"I don't try to replicate what's been done before," Ruscha said. "I don't stand up there with a color sample and demand accuracy."
For accuracy, there's La Paloma. "They're fabricators extraordinaire," said Ruscha.
While Ruscha was in Venice cornering the market on Nestlé syrup, Ron McPherson, Edan's father, was working the press at the storied Los Angeles print shop Gemini G.E.L. That's where he first met Ruscha. When Ron started La Paloma, shifting to fiberglass and metal fabrication, they continued working together -- in 1985, for instance, his company built a set of giant curved stretchers for Ruscha's mural in the Miami-Dade Public Library rotunda. When the call came in 1995 to revive "Chocolate Room," Ron was his man.
In late March, I visited La Paloma's vast workshop on the fringe of the San Fernando Valley. Ron and his team, now led by his son, Edan, have installed every "Chocolate Room" but the first: "Los Angeles twice, Palm Springs, Anchorage, Reno, Oklahoma City." The New York install is different. Ruscha's survey is an occasion to dial in the "Chocolate Room" recipe for the ages.
To get the shingles to hang straight, they chose a coated paper. They experimented with different chocolates, too. "We wanted to stick with a commercial mix," Edan said. "Something you could get consistently."
They'd always used regular Hershey's bars before. So long as the brand uses pure ingredients, it's a matter of color. They'd winnowed it to three -- Hershey's regular, a dark Ghirardelli's and a darker Callebaut -- and sent samples to Ruscha's studio. He chose the Callebaut. MoMA's team matched it with a touch-up paint, to fill in around the walls' edges: Benjamin Moore Arroyo Red.
Most of all, La Paloma wanted to prevent the powdery, fatty bloom that sometimes, not always, covers the chocolate's surface. The trick, as chocolatiers know, is to temper the chocolate, and keep it tempered as it's shaped.
The double boilers they'd been using to melt the Hershey's bars were inexact. Now they travel with the ChocoVision Revolation Delta, an electronically regulated, air-heated, self-stirring metal bowl that puts chocolate through its paces, up to 115 degrees or so, then back down to 86. Then, explained Edan, "you add a little bit of unmelted chocolate, and that tempers it." It's called "seeding": "The seeding tells the cocoa butter molecules how to realign correctly inside the chocolate."
"We printed and then everything looked fine," Edan added. They hung up some test sheets at LACMA. "But then several days later it started to bloom."
They realized the light bulbs they'd rigged over the press to keep the chocolate flowing were a little too hot, and it was separating again. Now they use controllable heat lamps and a voltage regulator. The crew monitors the chocolate ink with an infrared thermometer. During printing, the temperature is kept around 95 degrees.
All this precision -- but the result, almost by design, remains capricious. Every installation is different. MoMA is the first version using dark chocolate, which Ruscha said in an email, "was a visual choice and was more appealing." A few of the corners went on thicker than the rest, and look slightly toasted. The exhibition team sent photos to Ruscha. The artist approved.

Full text: The new Perelman Performing Arts Center is the most glamorous civic building to land in New York in years.
The official ribbon cutting is on Wednesday. You may have noticed the building under construction if you were near the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan during the past year or so. A floating, translucent marble cube, it nestles at the foot of One World Trade Center, just eight stories high, a runt in a herd of mega-tall commercial skyscrapers but impossible to miss.
The $ 500 million, 129,000-square-foot project arrives at a moment, and in a New York, very different from the one in which it was conceived two decades ago. Back then, the city was all-consumed by grief and fear, its economy in free-fall, ground zero still a smoldering gravesite. We were reminded just this week of the toll when the names of the thousands of dead were again read aloud.
The focus after Sept. 11 was rightly on the families of victims, some of the most vocal ones lobbying to enshrine the entire 16-acre site as a memorial; and officials struggled to reconcile those pleas with the urgent need to restore the economy and downtown. Authorities trumpeted shiny new office towers as middle fingers to Osama bin Laden, secured by new checkpoints and bollards, and surrounding the twin memorial pools.
At the same time there were downtown residents and others who argued that a retort to terrorism -- and what the neighborhood needed to come back to life -- was a place for the arts. "The community that stayed was steadfast in supporting a cultural component," Catherine McVay Hughes, the former chairwoman for the area's Community Board 1, told The New York Times in 2016. "It was important that something alive gets created here, right here, at the World Trade Center site."
A generation has now passed. New York has weathered other crises and faces more. Perelman opens post-pandemic, when the theater business is hemorrhaging jobs and it's not clear how many people will return to work in offices, much less venture to the World Trade Center for an evening of contemporary dance or global pop. Ground zero remains unfinished, with major parcels still empty, and Perelman is hardly the last piece of the puzzle -- just the most public, welcoming one so far that isn't a shopping mall or a Path train station.
And the most promising.
Its architect is Joshua Ramus. He refers to the building as a "mystery box," alluding to the three exquisitely engineered, shape-shifting theaters tucked inside it. Small, medium and large, they're swathed in modular acoustic wood panels, resting on thick rubber pads that further dampen the rumble of subways passing under the building, and they can be combined and reshuffled into more than 60 configurations, their floors raked or flat, balconies collapsed or thrust, walls moved, stages lowered.
This trio of high-tech theaters is veiled behind a facade made up of thousands of half-inch-thick, richly veined marble panels that are sandwiched between whisperingly thin sheets of glass. The veins create lozenge-shaped patterns that ripple across all four sides of the building. After dark, when the memorial park across the street empties and office workers head home, Perelman lights up like a lantern. Its white stone turns amber. And chandeliers in the towering corridor hugging the center's curtain wall cast the silhouettes of milling theatergoers onto the glowing marble, summoning the neighborhood back to life.
Lower Manhattan didn't die. It flourished after Sept. 11, its residential population tripling. But the World Trade Center has remained an alien zone. An arts institution became an early casualty of the chaos. Frank Gehry was hired to design it, and then fired. Tenants came and went. The Port Authority jammed down the public's throat a vain, profligate showpiece building called the Oculus, by Santiago Calatrava, to house that Path station and shopping mall. Dreams of an arts center gradually slipped down the memory chute.
But they never evaporated. In 2015, Ramus's marble cube prevailed in an international design competition staged to reboot the project. The following year, Ronald O. Perelman, the cosmetics mogul, donated $ 75 million to rally funding.
Ramus, who is now 54, had led the design of Seattle's Central Library more than a decade earlier, one of the very great buildings of the early century. A partner at the time with Rem Koolhaas, he co-owned their New York office. The partners then separated, and Ramus took over the office, rebranding his firm Rex.
The Seattle library clearly became a precedent for Perelman, a design of similarly obsessive rationalism, with its vertiginous, flexible interiors. I gather Ramus and his team also visited the great Milanese Chiesa di Nostra Signora della Misericordia, from the 1950s, with its matte glass shell. The most obvious source is Gordon Bunshaft's Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale -- not just because of its translucent marble, but for its sarcophagal aura.
In the Perelman center's case, the structural challenge was building it over four underground stories of knotty, immovable infrastructure -- a maze of train tracks, ventilation ducts and truck ramps that service the World Trade Center site. The first 21 feet above the sidewalk also belonged to the Port Authority, for practical and security reasons.
Ramus partnered with Davis Brody Bond, the veteran New York architecture firm, and the structural engineer Jay Taylor, a senior principal at Magnusson Klemencic Associates, the engineering firm that worked on the original Twin Towers. Among the tracks and ramps, they found far-flung load-bearing points in the bedrock to support a system of belt trusses, which cradle the theaters. Ceding the Port Authority its 21 feet, they raised Perelman onto a black granite plinth, tucking an entry stair below the south wall of the building, whose cantilevered corner lifts enticingly up from the sidewalk like a pleated skirt.
The staircase becomes the closest the World Trade Center has to a public stoop for hanging out, which it needs. Fingers crossed, security won't shoo sitters off the steps.
That stairway deposits visitors who don't prefer to use an elevator at a lobby that serves as the building's warm, inviting underbelly. Designed by the Rockwell Group, with a sculptured ceiling of lights tucked into spirals of wooden ribs, the lobby level features a stage, a lounge, and a restaurant by Marcus Samuelsson. From morning until late at night, this floor of the building will be free and open to the public, with a terrace that gives a High Line-level view of Lower Manhattan.
Superbly crafted, Perelman ultimately cost twice its initial budget, enough to support who knows how many existing community arts organizations around the city for who knows how many years. Most of the money was privately donated, with Michael Bloomberg contributing the biggest chunk, $ 130 million. New Yorkers may recall that, as mayor, he lobbied to include housing and schools along with offices and a smaller memorial at the World Trade Center, but his idea was shouted down.
Now he is putting his money where his mouth was, even ginning up business for Perelman like a chamber of commerce president, telling The Times "it's a great place" for "weddings, bar mitzvahs, confirmations, graduations."
Housing should finally be arriving at ground zero, too. Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York recently announced that 5 World Trade Center, a KPF-designed tower slated for the south end of the site, will include 1,200 apartments, 400 of them subsidized.
More subsidized units would be helpful, but that's a step in the right direction. The World Trade Center may yet turn into a recognizably mixed-use neighborhood.
I walked the other day along that tall corridor hugging the curtain wall in Perelman, a 10-foot-wide space rising 78 feet into the rafters. Summer sunlight filtered through the marble. I was reminded of the colonnade at the Jefferson Memorial, another exalted retreat from a tourist mecca.
Then I exited onto the plaza straddling One World Trade, which Perelman plans to use for open-air events. If you look closely, you may notice that the building's footprint is oriented at a slight angle to the skyscrapers around it. A serendipity of the underground engineering, the angle is a tad irreverent.
At ground zero, irreverence is new and good. Perelman's success will now depend on its public space and program of events to entice visitors to the World Trade Center.
But this much is clear: Lower Manhattan could have hardly asked for a more spectacular work of public architecture.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
½ teaspoon red-pepper flakes
4 (6- to 8-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets, patted dry
Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
1 pound green beans, stem end trimmed and beans halved crosswise
Kernels from 4 ears of corn (about 4 cups)
½ small red onion, thinly sliced
3 tablespoons lime juice (from 2 limes) 1. Heat the broiler to high and set a rack in the upper third in the oven. In a medium bowl, stir to combine 2 tablespoons oil with the turmeric and red-pepper flakes. Season the salmon all over with 1 teaspoon salt, then toss to coat in the spiced oil. 2. On a sheet pan, toss the green beans, half the corn kernels, 1 tablespoon olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. Spread into an even layer, then nestle the salmon among the vegetables, skin side up. 3. Broil until the green beans are blistered and charred in spots, and the salmon's skin is crisp and the flesh is opaque and flakes easily with a fork, 6 to 10 minutes. Halfway through broiling, check the vegetables; if any are burning, give them a stir so they're no longer in direct contact with the broiler. 4. In a large bowl, stir together the remaining corn kernels, the red onion, lime juice and 1 teaspoon salt. 5. Transfer the salmon to a platter or plates, then scrape the charred vegetables into the bowl of raw corn and onion. Stir to combine and season to taste with salt. Spoon the vegetables alongside the salmon and drizzle everything with a little olive oil.

This meal marries charred flavors with bright vegetables, and no grill is required. Broiling salmon skin side up creates crispy skin without drying out the delicate flesh. Alongside your salmon, blister green beans and corn, then toss them with lime juice, raw corn and red onion for a balance of crunchy and tender, sweet and scorched. Turmeric and redpepper flakes bring earthiness alongside the sweetness of the fish, corn and green beans, but garam masala, cumin or jerk seasoning would also work well.

Michelin Stars Bring Prestige, But at a Cost: [National Desk]

Full text: As its universe of dining guides expands to new places, the company is asking those regions to help pay the bill. And some chefs fear the honors are fostering a world of restaurant clones.
When the chef Caroline Glover heard in June that Michelin would be publishing a restaurant guide to Colorado, she was thrilled at first.
"I've seen Michelin move across the country, but never thought Colorado would be next," said Ms. Glover, who co-owns the restaurant Annette, in Aurora.
One of the state's culinary leaders, she was named best chef in the Mountain region last year by the James Beard Foundation. Her restaurant is a fixture on best-of-Denver lists.
Colorado's stars will be revealed on Tuesday at a gala event in Denver, and speculation has been frenzied. But one thing is certain: No one from Michelin has inspected Ms. Glover's restaurant, and she will not be getting any stars. That's because Annette is about 500 feet past the city limit that divides Denver and Aurora. And while the Denver tourism board paid Michelin to be included, its counterpart in Aurora did not.
The Michelin Guide, owned by the French tire manufacturer, is the world's most widely recognized authority on fine dining. Its stars have fueled the dreams of generations of chefs, and are always the first thing mentioned about restaurants that have them. In recent years, with competition from the World's 50 Best Restaurants list and other awards, the company has been aggressively seeking new ways to generate revenue, expand its geographic reach and modernize the idea of what makes a Michelin restaurant.
In interviews, dozens of restaurateurs, chefs and officials across the country said the status the stars confer is priceless, and comes with vast earning potential. But they also voiced reservations about Michelin's priorities and influence.
Curiosity has always swirled around how the company does its work: Who are the inspectors? How often do they visit? What does it take to rise from two stars to three? (The chefs Gordon Ramsay, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Thomas Keller and Alain Ducasse all began their empires by winning three stars, the highest rating.)
Now, more sweeping questions are arising about what the guides mean in today's culinary world. Does the quest for stars generate excellence, or sameness? Do deals with the tourism industry and food brands suggest that Michelin's attention and the prestige it confers are at least partly for sale? And can the stars keep their luster as Michelin selectively expands its universe?
The Price of Admission
Gwendal Poullenec, the director of the guides, said in an interview that although the company accepts "partnership" money to offset the expenses of the review process, the decision about whether a region merits its own Michelin guide is determined solely by the company's inspectors, who "assess the maturity" of the culinary scene as a preliminary step.
Since publishing its first American guide, to New York City, in 2005, Michelin has moved into California, Washington, D.C., Chicago and Florida.
Mr. Poullenec said that "vibrancy" and "dynamic potential" are also taken into consideration, as an explanation of why rapidly growing Florida and Colorado -- and Atlanta, coming next year -- have guides, while New Orleans and New England do not.
A Michelin announcement about its Colorado guide last month declared, "Our anonymous Inspectors combed the Centennial State for the most delicious spots," But in fact, only restaurants in Denver, Boulder, Aspen, Vail, Snowmass and Beaver Creek were being considered.
Michelin's inspection process, and the firewall it long maintained between the guides and the restaurant industry -- no free meals, no sponsors, no advertising -- have given it a special status. It is a costly undertaking (which used to be financed by the sales of hundreds of thousands of hardcover guides per year), but it has convinced consumers and chefs that Michelin makes all its decisions impartially.
For Michelin's first century, that was largely true, including for the first New York City guide, in 2005, and the San Francisco Bay and Napa Valley guides in 2007. But only since 2019, when Visit California paid Michelin $ 600,000, have top restaurants in Los Angeles and elsewhere in the state earned stars.
So while it is still true that individual restaurants can't buy stars, tourism boards and hotel owners can buy the possibility.
In 2010, after the guides had been losing money for years, the parent company hired the consulting giant Accenture to assess their future. Soon, the Michelin Guide began to transform itself from an elite, arms-length critic of the restaurant industry to a financial partner.
Michelin began accepting money from sponsors like food brands, liquor distributors, hotel chains and tourism agencies. Michelin guides in Thailand, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore were all published with financial backing from local tourism authorities. Companies like Nestlé and Lavazza now sponsor Michelin awards like Rising Star Chef, Sommelier of the Year and Pastry Chef of the Year.
The director of the Colorado Tourism Office, Tim Wolfe, led the effort to bring Michelin to his state. Among Colorado's tourism boards and even its state restaurant association, the notion of restaurants -- rather than ski slopes or rock faces -- as travel destinations is rather new. But, he said, he knew that international visitors to Colorado spend five times more than domestic ones, so it was an easy call.
To get the guide, his agency agreed to contribute $ 100,000 a year for three years. Following suit were four tourism boards (Denver, Boulder, Aspen, Vail) and two resort companies (Snowmass and Beaver Creek); they told The New York Times that they each paid Michelin $ 70,000 to $ 100,000. Aurora and Colorado Springs, among others, declined to participate.
"I love all my children equally," Mr. Wolfe said. "But if Colorado Springs wanted to get involved, they have to get involved." Visit Aurora and Visit Colorado Springs declined to comment on their decisions.
The chef Brother Luck, the owner of three restaurants in Colorado Springs and a former "Top Chef" contestant, was appalled to see his city passed over.
"How do you leave out the second-largest city in the state?' he said. "It feels like a slap in the face."
Mr. Poullenec, the Michelin director, said Colorado Springs and other places left out of the guide have the option of joining next year.
Changing Tastes
In Florida, which received its first round of Michelin stars in 2022, a similar situation played out. That state's guide was funded with more than $ 1.5 million from state and city tourism budgets, according to an investigation by The Miami Herald. As a result, only restaurants in the Miami, Tampa and Orlando areas were eligible for stars.
"I'm beyond disappointed -- after the years I've put in carrying the torch for South Florida," said Timon Balloo, a chef who cooked in and around Miami for 35 years, creating the successful national chain Sugarcane Bar & Grill and Downtown Miami's popular Balloo before the pandemic forced him to move to Fort Lauderdale. He said that if he had known the move would make him ineligible for Michelin consideration, he would have fought harder to keep his footing in Miami.
Even some Miami chefs were disappointed at the inaugural ceremony, though. Michelin gave no restaurant three stars, and named only one with two stars: L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon, in Miami's Design District, an outpost of a global restaurant chain founded by French chef who had been dead for four years.
"You could hear the air go out of the room," said the chef Niven Patel. "It was utter shock."
Amid decades of expansion, Michelin has maintained that its stars transcend geography, taste and trends; that a one-star restaurant in Hangzhou can (and must) have the same value as a one-star restaurant in Hamburg or Honfleur or Hialeah.
The star system -- one, worth a stop; two, worth a detour; three, worth a journey -- was devised more than a century ago to guide businessmen as they motored around France on the company's tires. Today, "when someone is flying from Germany to San Diego to eat at your restaurant, the stakes are much higher," said William Bradley, the chef-owner of Addison, Southern California's only three-star Michelin restaurant.
So are the costs. Michelin inspectors are full-time employees, and are sent around the world to perform evaluations, ensuring that no inspectors can privilege relationships or preferences in their own regions.
The challenge for Michelin seems to be balancing the high standards that give the brand its power with the imperative to expand into markets that may not have many restaurants that meet those standards. Mr. Poullenec said that Michelin's culinary and editorial judgments far outweigh financial considerations. "We need to grow, not compromise," he said.
One way Michelin is trying to meet that challenge is adding new awards. Restaurants noted for their environmental sustainability can now get a green star. Those that offer good value can earn the Bib Gourmand. In 2017, Michelin introduced a new category for restaurants deemed good, but not good enough for a star: briefly called Michelin Plate, but now simply Recommended.
Already the terms "Michelin-recommended and "Michelin-recognized" have become a common plaudit for the more than 16,600 restaurants that appear in the guide at every level. Of those, only 3,400 have stars, and just 142 have three.
In some ways, this expanding of the honors is a win-win. Unlike a James Beard award or a spot on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list, Michelin stars are something any number of restaurants can win, and keep on winning. More restaurants in more places get to flash the Michelin credentials, and Michelin gets to expand its reach and become a more widely recognized arbiter of quality.
But when thousands of vaguely recommended restaurants can call themselves "Michelin" destinations, Michelin may risk diluting its brand.
'Chasing the Validation'
Chefs began to publicly push back against Michelin around the turn of the 21st century, rejecting what they saw as its focus on luxurious trappings like foie gras and caviar, crystal glassware and linen hand towels.
In 1999, the celebrated British chef Marco Pierre White renounced his three stars, citing the pressure and monotony of maintaining them, and questioning the authority of inspectors. Next came the 2003 suicide of the French chef Bernard Loiseau, who believed that his restaurant was being demoted from three stars to two.
Recent objections have focused on the elaborate, multicourse menus that draw Michelin stars. They have historically relied on long hours of low-paid (sometimes unpaid) labor, raising questions about the human cost of fine dining. René Redzepi, the chef of Noma, in Copenhagen, decided to close the restaurant soon after it finally won its third star, citing the unsustainability of the business model.
Mr. Luck, the Colorado Springs chef, said the mental health costs of the restaurant business are already too high, without worrying about Michelin stars. "We have to protect the next generations," he said, adding. "I worry that chasing the validation of these standards and these stars can be dangerous."
Niki Nakayama of n/naka in Los Angeles said that while she longs to rise from two stars to three, she can't afford the upgrades she believes it would take: more courses, matching uniforms, more carefully arranged plates.
"Plating is a trajector of how money has influenced the business," she said. "The more labor you can afford for the tweezer work, the matching uniforms, the spotless glasses, the more Michelin stars you can hope for."
Many chefs and diners see a creeping sameness among Michelin-starred restaurants around the world, and not only in the consistently excellent ingredients and techniques that the guide says it rewards. Long menus of pre-composed mouthfuls, tiny proteins and the ostentatiously arranged small plates satirized in "The Menu" have become the rule.
"At this point, we can all serve Japanese fish, we can all do knife work, we can all make a gelée," said Charlie Mitchell, the chef and co-owner of Clover Hill, in Brooklyn Heights. He said that since winning a star last year, he has had to fight the urge to make his food ever more Michelin-friendly rather than following his own instincts.
"I catch myself adding a purée, a tuile, an herb, a flower" to new plates, he said, "just to make it look more fine dining."
But most chefs said the opportunity Michelin offers for a steady supply of well-heeled diners, eager sous-chefs and endless publicity trumps any other concerns. And many say that having Michelin stars to strive for simply makes restaurants better.
"Not a lot of chefs here really deserve it yet," said Bo Porytko, the chef at Misfit Snackbar and Molotov in Denver, citing repetitious farm-to-table menus and timid seasoning. "But I hope it will push everyone to get better and be more adventurous."

It was all rainbows and unicorns for a while. But like many fun ideas, Big Gay Ice Cream has wound up in debt and in court.
With a rollicking rise that leveraged queer identity as a brand strategy, the New York City-based soft-serve chain opened seven shops in the Northeast and landed its products in supermarkets nationwide. The company now is down to just one location.
On Friday, a founder and partner, Doug Quint, filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court accusing another partner, Jon Chapski, of mismanaging the company and fraudulently collecting government loans during the pandemic.
On Tuesday afternoon, through a spokesperson, Chapski said only that he was reviewing the lawsuit with his lawyer and would respond “when appropriate.”
In 2009, when the Big Gay Ice Cream Truck first rolled into the annual Brooklyn Pride parade, it caught a wave of pop culture that included hits like “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way” and “Orange Is the New Black,” and marked a national shift that culminated in the legalization of marriage for same-sex couples across the country in 2015.
The company’s first shops exploded in Greenwich Village in a burst of rainbow sprinkles. Locals and tourists alike thrilled to the cheeky branding (Barbie dolls, glitter, “Golden Girls” references) and made pilgrimages for Bea Arthur swirls and Monday Sundaes.
Quint and Bryan Petroff, the avuncular (and gay) founders, went on to draw a mainstream following that helped make “don’t ask, don’t tell” a thing of the past (in food marketing, at least). In 2017, Nestlé began distributing the company’s hard-pack ice cream in supermarkets nationwide; People magazine covered the introduction of three new flavors in 2019.
“I thought Big Gay was my life’s work, the thing I was meant to do,” said Quint, who gave up his decadeslong career as a classical musician in 2011, when the business had two profitable stores and he had secured a six-figure deal to write the cookbook “Big Gay Ice Cream: Saucy Stories and Frozen Treats.”
During the pandemic, though, the good vibes evaporated. Today, after multiple missteps, unpaid debts and evictions, the company’s future is murky. Quint is working in a Walgreens pharmacy in Pittsfield, Maine, where he grew up. Petroff works in human resources for a New York restaurant chain.
Both men say they hope to pull the company back from the brink and continue without Chapski, whom they hired as a financial adviser in 2011 and made a partner in 2016. The founders continued to develop new products and marketing efforts, but Chapski effectively ran the business.
Quint is seeking at least $4 million, claiming damages arising from breach of contract, fiduciary irresponsibility and “willful misconduct” by Chapski. (Petroff, who like Quint still retains a 35% ownership stake, has declined to be a party to the suit, citing the expense of legal representation, but said Quint had his “full support.”)
In his lawsuit, Quint accuses Chapski of failing to pay landlords, vendors and the IRS; concealing legal proceedings and business moves from him and Petroff; and collecting government loans during the pandemic while the stores remained closed and employees went unpaid. Public records show that the four New York City stores — each of which is a separate limited-liability corporation — received loans totaling more than $500,000.
Quint said in an interview that Chapski has maintained his lifestyle even as the company has descended into debt. Chapski and his wife, Agnes, a former publisher of In Style and Allure magazines, own a 2,000-square-foot loft in TriBeCa and a beach house in Montauk, New York. (The beach property went into foreclosure on Aug. 14, according to documents filed in Suffolk County Supreme Court.)
The one remaining ice cream store, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, is operated by Jeremy Wladis, a longtime neighborhood restaurateur. On Friday, Wladis said he had been granted permission to use the Big Gay brand and recipes by Chapski, who repeatedly assured him that the founders were no longer involved.
Wladis told the Times that he felt uneasy about the arrangement and tried many times to contact them directly, but never got a reply. Quint and Petroff say that was because Chapski had secretly blocked their access to company email and social-media feeds.
The company began as a summer-job lark when Quint and Petroff outfitted an old van, created a menu of bedazzled soft-serve treats and sailed it to Prospect Park as the Big Gay Ice Cream Truck.
Zac Young, now a Food Network star and then the pastry chef at Butter in NoLIta, said he felt equal parts shock, fear and pride when the truck rolled out: “I thought, you can’t do that, you can’t say that!”
Restaurant kitchens were rife with homophobic abuse, he said, and even the traditional “pink ghetto” of pastry operations was usually run by straight white men (though women and gay men often carried out the pastry chef’s vision).
The company’s rapid rise “proved to me that you could be queer and open in the food space, and still be safe and loved,” Young said.
Not everyone was a fan. Some LGBTQ+ people balked at the upbeat marketing of a community still enduring hate. Bill Yosses, the pastry chef at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, said, “It trivializes the real struggles that gay people have endured.”
Christina Tosi, the pastry chef and founder of the Milk Bar dessert shops, had just started working at the New York restaurant Momofuku when Big Gay first rolled out. “They had a commitment to flavor and creativity and humor that carved out space for us all,” she said.
She went on to build an empire on innovative tastes like cereal milk-flavored soft-serve. “People’s willingness to cannonball and take a chance comes from them,” she said.
The Big Gay Ice Cream stores in the East Village and West Village flourished. The truck toured the South, drawing crowds in Atlanta and Charleston, South Carolina. A Philadelphia shop followed, along with local high-profile New York locations like the South Street Seaport and Madison Square Garden.
As the business expanded, the two founders relied on Chapski’s consulting company, Edible Assets, for bookkeeping and financial management.
In the 2016 partnership agreement, Quint and Petroff each retained a 35% share in the company, with the remaining 30% held by Edible Assets. That same year, they signed an amendment that gave Chapski “final authority and unilateral decision-making power over all financial matters,” while granting the same power to Quint and Petroff for the “creative direction” of the company.
“We were so naive,” Quint said ruefully, acknowledging that he and Petroff willingly entrusted Chapski with both their corporate finances and personal livelihoods.
But once Chapski was made a partner in Big Gay, according to the founders and three former employees, he pushed for growth that the company’s income and infrastructure could not sustain.
“He was always talking about being the next Starbucks,” said Gary Hernandez, a longtime manager who resigned in 2019.
Big Gay’s trajectory is not unusual in the food world. After a rapid rise in popularity and collaborations with The Walt Disney Co. and Marvel, the Brooklyn ice cream darling Ample Hills was bought by a venture capital firm and forced into bankruptcy.
Hernandez said that Quint and Petroff were not involved in Big Gay’s day-to-day operations or financial matters, and that after the company began expanding, chaos, conflict and angry calls from vendors and landlords became common. “That’s when stuff started going haywire,” he said.
Even so, by 2017, the brand was strong enough to earn a coveted place in supermarket freezers, with pints sold nationally at stores such as Safeway, Wawa and CVS.
Quint was walking his dog when his sister first sent a photograph of the pints at the market in his rural hometown. He packed the car and drove straight to Maine. “I had to see it with my own eyes,” he said. Then, he said, he went to the dumpster out back and cried for the miserable gay teenager who had fled to New York to study music in 1989.
“I ran from this place when I was 17,” he said. “I could never have imagined ending up back here.”
But in 2020, with the stores closed indefinitely under lockdown, Quint says he was forced to move out of New York, taking a minimum-wage job at a CVS. In 2021, the flagship store in the East Village closed; soon after, the company was evicted from its shops in the West Village and Philadelphia. (For the West Village store alone, the back rent owed was nearly $400,000, according to court documents.)
Without his knowledge, he said, federal loan money was flowing in while judgments and summonses were piling up on the doorstep of his unoccupied apartment. “What we didn’t realize is that creative control is meaningless, if the money is all up to someone else.”

Full text: A company that rode to success with an inclusive message has shrunk to a single store, as a founder sues a partner he accuses of mismanagement and fraud.

As the business expanded, the two founders relied on Chapski’s consulting company, Edible Assets, for bookkeeping and financial management.
In the 2016 partnership agreement, Quint and Petroff each retained a 35% share in the company, with the remaining 30% held by Edible Assets. That same year, they signed an amendment that gave Chapski “final authority and unilateral decision-making power over all financial matters,” while granting the same power to Quint and Petroff for the “creative direction” of the company.
“We were so naive,” Quint said ruefully, acknowledging that he and Petroff willingly entrusted Chapski with both their corporate finances and personal livelihoods.
But once Chapski was made a partner in Big Gay, according to the founders and three former employees, he pushed for growth that the company’s income and infrastructure could not sustain.
“He was always talking about being the next Starbucks,” said Gary Hernandez, a longtime manager who resigned in 2019.
Big Gay’s trajectory is not unusual in the food world. After a rapid rise in popularity and collaborations with The Walt Disney Co. and Marvel, the Brooklyn ice cream darling Ample Hills was bought by a venture capital firm and forced into bankruptcy.
Hernandez said that Quint and Petroff were not involved in Big Gay’s day-to-day operations or financial matters, and that after the company began expanding, chaos, conflict and angry calls from vendors and landlords became common. “That’s when stuff started going haywire,” he said.
Even so, by 2017, the brand was strong enough to earn a coveted place in supermarket freezers, with pints sold nationally at stores such as Safeway, Wawa and CVS.
Quint was walking his dog when his sister first sent a photograph of the pints at the market in his rural hometown. He packed the car and drove straight to Maine. “I had to see it with my own eyes,” he said. Then, he said, he went to the dumpster out back and cried for the miserable gay teenager who had fled to New York to study music in 1989.
“I ran from this place when I was 17,” he said. “I could never have imagined ending up back here.”
But in 2020, with the stores closed indefinitely under lockdown, Quint says he was forced to move out of New York, taking a minimum-wage job at a CVS. In 2021, the flagship store in the East Village closed; soon after, the company was evicted from its shops in the West Village and Philadelphia. (For the West Village store alone, the back rent owed was nearly $400,000, according to court documents.)
Without his knowledge, he said, federal loan money was flowing in while judgments and summonses were piling up on the doorstep of his unoccupied apartment. “What we didn’t realize is that creative control is meaningless, if the money is all up to someone else.”

Full text: The ice-cold cocktail is delicious in its simplest form -- and it's also endlessly customizable.
A classic Mexican beer-based cocktail, the deeply chilled, lightly effervescent Michelada is easy and refreshing to drink. Its defined form, however, is a bit more complicated, inspiring intense debate as to what is and isn't included in the final glass.
"The definition of a Michelada will change depending on where in Mexico or where in the world you ask," said Sofía Acuña, an owner of Dooriban and Moa in Mexico City.
Recipe: Michelada
For some, a Michelada -- or Chelada, depending on where in Mexico you are, and again, who you ask -- is "just the mix of beer, lime juice and salt," Ms. Acuña said.
The name comes from "mi chela helada," approximately "my cold beer" in English. A light Mexican lager, such as Tecate, Corona, Pacifico, Carta Blanca, Sol or Modelo, is the classic choice for that cold beer, letting the flavors shine.
Beyond that, the drink's final formula is more pliable, generating strong opinions and heated discussion over how, exactly, it is made. The most common additions can include but are not limited to: a dash of Worcestershire sauce (or salsa inglesa), a few -- or many -- drops of hot sauce and Maggi seasoning (which Ms. Acuña would call a Cubana), and splashes of Clamato or tomato juice, or both (some, she notes, would call that an Ojo Rojo).
And modern interpretations expand the choice of condiments to kaleidoscopic.
"Before everyone was aiming for the best classic Michelada, using the same ingredients, just with different amounts," Ms. Acuña said. "Now, people are open to experimenting, but there's always something acidic, something spicy, something salty."
Switch out lime juice for another citrus, such as lemon, or even a tart dry vinegar. The Michelada at Ticuchi in Mexico City, designed by Yana Volfson, a partner, makes use of both fresh yuzu juice and a yuzu kosho made with chile de agua. When making Micheladas at home, Yola Jiménez, the founder of Yola Mezcal, often adds slices of fresh serrano pepper or jalapeño to her drink for spice. (A drizzle of Sriracha or a crack of black pepper work, too.)
For salinity, incorporate a splash of soy sauce, olive juice or pickled jalapeño brine. At Dooriban, Ms. Acuña uses kimchi juice in place of Clamato to make a Kimchelada. A Michelada can also be fortified with a boozy spirit. Scarlett Lindeman, the owner of Ojo Rojo Diner in Mexico City, punches up the base of her chipotle-spiked Ojo Rojo with a shot of mezcal.
As for the rim, lime and salt is classic, and Tajín, a chile-lime salt, is also popular. Ms. Acuña has also seen variations with cilantro or celery salts. (Her Kimchelada has a gochugaru and salt rim.) Sometimes, the rim is dipped not in lime juice but in chamoy, a sour-sweet condiment traditionally made from fermented fruit, sugar, salt and chiles.
At Mari Gold in Mexico City, the chef and co-owner Norma Listman drops a spoonful of a seasonal housemade chamoy in the glass before adding jamaica sal chaat, a blend of hibiscus, black salt and amchur, to the rim.
And no matter where you fall on the Michelada spectrum, make sure the drink is imbibed ice-cold. Start by pouring it directly over ice. If you have the time and space, double down and chill your glasses in the freezer for an hour or two -- mugs, beer glasses or taller, wider glassware work best here -- before making and serving to added frosty effect.
Or skip straight to the good part and make your Michelada right in an ice-cold beer can.
"In the end, for me, a Michelada is a mix of ingredients with a beer that will taste delicious," Ms. Acuña said. "It can be so simple with just lime juice and salt, or a lot more complex if you start adding sauces and spiciness."
Whatever you add -- or don't add -- to your Michelada start with the constants: beer, lime, salt. The end result will define your ideal Michelada.

Masterpiece Vanishing Into the Marsh: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This patch of coastal wetland between highway and marsh, just behind downtown Brunswick, Ga., is a kind of pilgrimage site -- though no sign points to it.
Look for a small park along U.S. 17, with a pavilion and a pier from which people fish and trap crabs. Across the channel, the Marshes of Glynn stretch flat to the horizon.
But the object of interest -- to some art historians and aficionados -- sits just outside the park, where the spartina cordgrass takes over. Three rocklike forms nestle in the vegetation. They are weathered and easy to miss.
Here is a major work of American outdoor sculpture, hiding in plain sight. What look from afar like a random trio of rocks are in fact constructions of concrete topped with tabby, a historic material in this region formed from oyster shells, sand and water.
The "Marsh Ruins," as they are called, are arguably the masterwork of the painter and sculptor Beverly Buchanan. She built them in 1981, her own intervention in a charged landscape. The work is partly a homage to Igbo Landing, a fundamental story of Black freedom-seeking that unfolded at the other end of these marshes. It also deals a gnomic retort to "Marshes of Glynn," a 19th-century poem steeped in antebellum nostalgia.
For four decades, the sculpture has sat unmarked and unknown, cracking and sinking into the marsh -- just as the artist intended.
Buchanan, who died in 2015, grew up in Orangeburg, S.C., and emerged as an artist in New York before returning to the South in 1977, first to Macon, Ga. There she entered a period in which she placed works in the landscape. She built the "Marsh Ruins" in two sweltering days, with a local contractor, spending money from a Guggenheim Fellowship.
She had obtained necessary permits, but made no arrangements for the sculpture's future. But she would later return from time to time to photograph or just contemplate what some believe was the work she most cherished.
One afternoon last May, I checked on the "Marsh Ruins," having first visited them in 2018. Treading carefully on the soggy ground, I pushed through the dense cordgrass to inspect them. Fallen sections of tabby revealed the concrete substrate traversed by deep fissures. Their outer treatment, a copperish acrylic pigment, has long faded.
These need attention, I thought. And then caught myself: Or do they?
The "Marsh Ruins" present a paradox. They are recognized as a crucial work, amid a strong, albeit posthumous, renewal of interest in Buchanan. Her first thorough survey, which opened in 2016 at the Brooklyn Museum, organized by the artist Park McArthur and the curator Jennifer Burris, showed them in a video projected at large scale. That same year, the art historian Andy Campbell examined them in an article. In 2021, the art historian Amelia Groom devoted a book, "Marsh Ruins," to the work.
On the other hand, they are slowly vanishing, their decay built into their premise. Buchanan called them "ruins," after all. And while her other large-scale works of this period have caretakers -- they sit on museum grounds, a college campus, a station plaza -- she entrusted the "Marsh Ruins" only to the elements and time.
What should be done when a work is major partly because the artist invited its decay? Perhaps the "Marsh Ruins" challenge us to rethink the possibilities of conservation itself.
Buchanan trained as a scientist. She came to New York City for graduate studies, earning master's degrees in parasitology and public health from Columbia University in the late 1960s, then worked as a health educator in the Bronx and New Jersey. But she also made and began showing abstract paintings, encouraged by Norman Lewis and Romare Bearden.
Her turn to sculpture began in New York. She used found bricks as molds for casting concrete and pulverized rocks to make pigments. She called the works "frustulas," from a Latin word meaning fragments. She was fascinated by decay, regeneration and how, as she wrote in 1978, "piles of rubble can be pulled together to form new systems."
She showed a "Wall Column" made of four cast cement sections in "Dialectics of Isolation: An Exhibition of Third World Women Artists of the United States," at A.I.R. Gallery -- a landmark 1980 show that challenged prevailing conceptions of feminist art. The artists Ana Mendieta, who helped organize the show, and Howardena Pindell, whom it also featured, were among her friends.
By then, however, she had resettled in small-town Georgia -- first Macon, then Athens -- beginning a fade from view in the New York scene that was later compounded by ill health. But the South held her heart and concerns, and in Georgia her sculpture added scales, materials and methods, in tune with the land and its stories.
Tabby, for instance, carried a deep charge. The material is closely associated with local Black survival practices during and after enslavement. Coastal Gullah-Geechee communities often used it to build dwellings and also to mark graves.
And while her large land sculptures are known, she made uncountable other pieces that she placed in locations known only to her, rarely documenting them. She might add a tabby brick to a graveyard; place an ephemeral rock arrangement by the roadside; immerse a concrete piece in the Ocmulgee River to sink, or a wood one to drift away. She kept materials to these ends in her yellow VW Beetle.
Buchanan's last official outdoor sculpture, "Blue Station Stones," was a public art project for a Miami-Dade Transit station, in 1986. She then turned principally to making "shack sculptures" -- wood miniatures of rural shacks, stylized and painted lively colors or plain like architectural models. She added drawings, photographs and annotations, à la Zora Neale Hurston, about the Georgia dwellings and people that inspired them.
For years her reputation was reduced to these works. "In short, Ms. Buchanan makes sculptures of shacks," read one 1994 review, comparing her to a folk artist. Elusive to begin with, her land pieces were mostly forgotten until the Brooklyn Museum show flagged off the rediscovery of her oeuvre.
Buchanan -- who has been represented since 2014 by the Andrew Edlin Gallery in New York -- now features in important thematic exhibitions like "The Dirty South" in 2021 at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, or "Groundswell: Women of Land Art," at the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas, which will open in September.
For that show's curator, Leigh Arnold, Buchanan's ambivalence to permanence and authorship helps to expand our understanding of land art as a category. "I think she thought of these environmental or private works as things that belonged to the world as a whole," Arnold told me. "She opened a window to histories rather than to herself."
When McArthur and Burris were filming the "Marsh Ruins," they fielded warnings from the men crabbing on the pier. "They said, you should watch out for the ghosts," Burris told me. "We said, what ghosts? And they told us the story."
In 1803, a boat loaded in Savannah a group of captives who survived the Middle Passage -- many Igbo -- to deliver to plantations in St. Simons and Sapelo Islands. In a creek on St. Simons, some men overpowered the crew and escaped in their shackles.
That part is documented. Much else about Igbo Landing is mythologized -- the men walk into the ocean with dignity; they magically take flight. But the story has attracted artists: Carrie Mae Weems, for instance, photographed the purported site in 1992.
Buchanan too knew the story, said Jane Bridges, her partner later in life; it bothered her that Igbo Landing had never received official recognition. "Beverly wasn't one to shout about this or that, but she would express her anger in a kind of seething way, and that's one time that I sensed it -- that there was no marker," Bridges told me. (St. Simons finally put up a marker honoring Igbo Landing in 2022.)
By contrast, a short walk from the "Marsh Ruins" stands a live oak with a historical marker. Under it, supposedly, Sidney Lanier was inspired in the late 1870s to write "The Marshes of Glynn," which rhapsodizes the landscape as evidence of God's glory. Lanier was a Confederate veteran; the marker calls him "Georgia's greatest poet."
Buchanan raised none of these matters when preparing her work. She merely sought and received permission from the state marshland authority for "a partially buried sculpture of tabby over concrete to achieve a look of ancient ruins." But Bridges has no doubt that for Buchanan, building the "Marsh Ruins" at this site was "an act of defiance."
Still, Buchanan never said directly what the ruins were about. Her choice of site was intentional; but by not publicizing the work and letting it decay, she upended all the conventions of commemoration. Instead the elements alter the work every day. "While they are dense with situated historical significance," writes Groom in her book on the "Marsh Ruins," "they exist in the present tense as ever-evolving forms."
The "Marsh Ruins" are still listed nowhere. In Brunswick itself, they are barely known, if at all. In emails, both Heather Heath, the director of Golden Isles Arts and Humanities, and John Hunter, the city's director of planning, development and codes, told me they had been unaware of the sculpture's existence.
Awareness, of course, does not guarantee optimal care. In Miami, Buchanan's "Blue Station Stones," which she tinted with a pigment to fade into the stone, got painted over -- garishly -- in a 2018 "beautification project." (In an email, Amanda Sanfilippo, the current curator of Miami's Art in Public Places, said the agency is now looking into restoring them "in a manner consistent with the artist's original vision and fabrication methodology.")
The greater risk to "Marsh Ruins" is that someone might remove them, unaware they are an artwork. Perhaps the marsh will swallow them first. But for Burris, they invite a form of conservation that directs care less to the objects than to the artist's intentions.
The more we think with Buchanan, the better we tend to her work. Thus the "Marsh Ruins," for instance, can help us notice the tabby cemeteries dotted around the region. "The memorials are in the landscape already," Burris said. "Hopefully her work allows us to see them and understand them."
Still, Buchanan claimed her work. She signed the "Marsh Ruins" in the form of a tiny concrete fragment that she placed in the brush near the roadside. It is badly crumbling but you can just make out that she etched: "Marsh Ruins, Beverly Buchanan, 7/81."
Bridges assured me that Buchanan would have been thrilled to see the "Marsh Ruins" make the paper; she cared about her legacy -- and this work.
In January 2003, on a road trip from Michigan, where Buchanan had gone to live with her, the two went to look at the "Marsh Ruins." Buchanan was already out of the car, walking stick and all, before Bridges could park. Then, Bridges told me, Buchanan gazed intently and silently at the sculpture for a long time.
"She was absorbing, and I can't even say what," Bridges said. "I always got the idea that of all the work she had made and that was part of her, this was the deepest."

Raw Milk May Be Legal, But the Risks Remain: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Health experts warn that drinking it could come with risks.
On July 1, Iowa officially became one of more than two dozen states that have legalized the sale of raw milk, or milk that has not been pasteurized.
Over the past decade, a growing number of states have made raw milk more accessible, said Dennis D'Amico, an associate professor of animal science at the University of Connecticut. Some of those states, including Iowa, allow raw milk producers to sell their products directly to consumers; others allow grocery stores to sell such products, and some states allow raw milk to be sold only as pet food.
But federal health experts have linked those new laws with increasing food-borne illness outbreaks associated with raw milk. Between 1998 and 2018, for instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the average number of raw milk-associated outbreaks across the United States increased. Outbreaks during those years sickened 2,645 people and caused 228 hospitalizations and three deaths.
Between 2013 and 2018, the agency reported, states that had legalized the sale of raw milk at retail stores had three times as many outbreaks as states that prohibited such sales.
The Food and Drug Administration classifies raw milk, which can come from cows, sheep or goats, as higher risk than pasteurized milk because of the potential for contamination with harmful germs. Children, older adults, people with compromised immune systems and those who are pregnant are especially vulnerable to severe infection, the agency says.
Some raw milk proponents argue that pasteurization zaps the nutrients from milk, or that raw milk can fight off pathogens on its own, said Nicole Helen Martin, a dairy microbiologist at Cornell University.
"We're seeing this a lot post-pandemic, people turning to 'local' or 'natural' -- I'm using air quotes -- foods," Dr. Martin said.
But there is no evidence that raw milk is healthier for you than pasteurized milk, she added. Under the most commonly used pasteurization method in the United States, Dr. Martin said, certain vitamins are only reduced by around less than 10 percent. "The claim that these components are 'destroyed' by pasteurization is simply untrue," she said.
The growing availability of raw milk is "a loss for public health," said Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University.
Why is raw milk dangerous?
Raw milk, along with other raw dairy products like unpasteurized ice creams, yogurts and cheeses, can harbor bacteria that cause common food-borne illnesses -- such as salmonella, listeria, campylobacter and E. coli. Germs may linger on a cow's udders or in the dirt around them, or on the hands of people who milk them, which can then contaminate the milk, said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of pediatrics, infectious diseases and epidemiology at Stanford Medicine.
Without pasteurization, which involves heating milk to kill harmful microbes, "it's kind of like if you don't wash your hands and you just lick them" instead, she said.
The risk of bacteria being present in raw milk remains even when dairy facilities appear to take precautions, Dr. Martin said. Many people say, "'Oh, this is my neighborhood farm, I've spent time there, the animals are super clean, I would eat in that parlor,"' she said. "The reality of the situation is, that doesn't matter."
If bacteria are present, even a small amount of raw milk can make you sick. The symptoms typically include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, fever, headache and body aches.
Depending on the pathogen, most healthy people recover within a few days or weeks, Dr. D'Amico said, but as with many food-borne illnesses, the symptoms can be severe and even life-threatening, especially if you're in a higher risk group.
People can get so dehydrated from severe vomiting and diarrhea that in rare cases, their kidneys fail, said Beth Czerwony, a registered dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic. If raw milk is contaminated with campylobacter bacteria, there is a small risk -- about one in 1,000, Dr. D'Amico said -- that a person who becomes infected with it can develop Guillain-Barré syndrome. This can cause muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis, according to the C.D.C., although most people recover fully.
"There are people who say, 'I've been drinking raw milk my whole life,"' Dr. Maldonado said. "Well, yeah, you can also drive around without a seatbelt or ride your motorcycle without a helmet." But eventually, she said, that behavior can catch up with you.
In many states where you can legally purchase raw milk, producers are required to do extra testing for pathogens. The odds of any one batch testing positive is fairly low, Dr. Martin said. But according to the C.D.C., those tests can't always detect low levels of contamination, so a negative test does not guarantee that raw milk is safe to drink.
"Pasteurization is one of the great advances in public health," Dr. Nestle said. "Why not just do it?"

Full text: The maker of Gatorade and Lay's, which nearly doubled its profit in its latest quarter, has been raising prices by double-digit percentages for more than a year.
PepsiCo reported a big jump in quarterly profit on Thursday, despite signs that customers are buying fewer cans of soda and bags of chips as the company continues to raise prices aggressively.
Pepsi, which makes Gatorade, Lay's and Quaker Oats, also raised its forecast for earnings in the rest of the year, pushing its stock higher.
The company reported 10 percent growth in revenue, to $ 22.3 billion, and nearly doubled its profit since the same time last year, to $ 2.7 billion, in its second quarter, which ended June 17. PepsiCo said it expected revenue to grow 10 percent for the full year, up from its previous forecast of 8 percent.
The quarterly results exceeded analysts' already optimistic expectations, as consumers wrestle with higher prices while policymakers weigh their next move in their efforts to tame inflation.
Though Pepsi earned more last quarter, the amount of products it sold went down. The prices of its products have risen by double-digit percentages for the past six quarters, and the company has reported dipping sales volumes for the past three quarters.
Pepsi's prices overall were 15 percent higher in the second quarter than they were a year earlier. The increase was particularly pronounced in Pepsi's European division, up 20 percent. Rising food prices in Europe have attracted particular scrutiny from economists and policymakers, who have said corporate profits were contributing to stubbornly high inflation there.
"We've been able to raise prices and consumers stay within our brands," Ramon Laguarta, chief executive of Pepsi, said on a call with analysts Thursday morning.
Mr. Laguarta attributed low unemployment in the United States and across the world as a reason consumers have continued to buy Pepsi products. Data released last week showed the U.S. labor market cooling but still strong.
Inflation data released Wednesday showed that consumer prices in the United States, including food, have gone up at a slower rate, though are still a ways away from the Federal Reserve's goal. Overall, food prices rose 5.7 percent over the year through June.
PepsiCo's shares rose about 2.4 percent Thursday. The food and beverage giant is one of the first companies to report earnings each quarter, serving as a bellwether for how other companies may perform. Companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report a 7 percent decline in profit in the second quarter, according to estimates compiled by FactSet.
Coca-Cola and Nestlé will report earnings later this month. Several major banks will report their results on Friday.

Full text: Ham El-Waylly's recipe tops a cheese-stuffed focaccia calzone with a tangle of charred onions.
Monday
I love Hetty McKinnon's recipe for crispy gnocchi with tomato and red onion, a warm panzanella with gnocchi standing in for bread. One of our subscribers added some sherry vinegar to the balsamic in the dressing for extra zip, and topped the dish with burrata "because I am alive and like joy." Approved! SAM SIFTON Tuesday
Yewande Komolafe's shrimp tacos are an easy weeknight win, with deeply spiced shrimp and quick-pickled red cabbage for crunch. I like them with guacamole and pico de gallo, but you'd be fine with hot sauce alone. SAM SIFTON Wednesday
Here's a tuna salad from Naz Deravian that nods at Iranians' love of pickles and fresh herbs. Naz nestles it into ciabatta and tops the salad with salted potato chips. She calls for canned tuna packed in water, but if you've got an Italian variety packed in olive oil, use that and cut back a little on the oil in the dressing. So good. SAM SIFTON Thursday One of the most fragrant one-pot meals you'll ever make, this pulao combines rice, vegetables and a rich array of spices. The recipe is from Priya Krishna, and it's a wonderfully satisfying and flexible dinner with yogurt dolloped on top. EMILY WEINSTEIN
Print tip: Think of black cardamom as the smoky, assertive cousin of green cardamom. Green cardamom, which comes from a different plant, is smaller and has a sweeter flavor. Both taste wonderful in pulao. Friday
And then you can round out the week with Nicole Taylor's excellent recipe for peach and molasses chicken. Nicole prepares it on a grill, but you could use your oven with a wire rack placed on a foil-lined sheet pan. Either way, I like mine with grits and sautéed greens.

Ivan Menezes, 63, Chief Executive Who Made Fusty Johnnie Walker Cool: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As chief executive of Diageo for a decade, he presented alcohol as an attainable luxury and helped brands like Smirnoff and Guinness grow.
Ivan Menezes, who as chief executive of the spirits corporation Diageo used his canny understanding of the drinking public to help the company grow into a global colossus, died on June 7 in London. He was 63.
The cause was complications of emergency surgery for a stomach ulcer, a Diageo spokesman said.
Diageo is omnipresent in the world of alcohol, selling more than 200 brands in more than 180 countries, including Smirnoff vodka, Tanqueray gin, Johnnie Walker Scotch, Captain Morgan rum and Guinness beer. In some spirit categories it has the largest global net sales.
Mr. Menezes (pronounced muh-NAY-zess) was trained in marketing and closely studied consumer sentiment. To him, spirits provided what he called "accessible luxury" to customers -- a dram of the good life even in an unstable economy.
"The example I like to use is, if you are an average New Yorker, it may be tough to spend a night at the Four Seasons," Mr. Menezes said in an interview with The New York Times in 2005, "but you could walk into the Four Seasons bar and enjoy a glass of Johnnie Walker Blue Label on the rocks."
Mr. Menezes, who became chief executive in 2013, was at Diageo from its inception. He was Guinness's strategy director in 1997 when the company merged with Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., which owned Burger King and Pillsbury, creating a conglomerate reportedly worth $ 33 billion.
After the merger, he became global marketing director for the company's beverage division in 1998.
One of his first challenges was making Johnnie Walker appeal to a new generation. It was not so much that young imbibers disliked the taste of blended Scotch, but rather that the drink's traditional tartan image felt fusty, Diageo's market research found.
"We are losing older drinkers by the bucketful, but only gaining new ones by the thimbleful," Mr. Menezes was quoted as saying in 1999 in the Scottish newspaper The Scotsman. "We will all benefit from everyone focusing on building brands and making their brands relevant to younger consumers."
That year Mr. Menezes spent 100 million pounds (about $ 224 million in today's dollars) to revamp Johnnie Walker's image with an international advertising campaign developed by the agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty.
The campaign introduced the slogan "Keep walking" and featured three television advertisements, including one in which the actor Harvey Keitel walked into a coliseum filled with lions as he talked about overcoming stage fright; another showed the French funambulist Ramon Kelvink walking a tightrope between buildings.
"With this campaign, we hope to build an emotional bond with the consumer through the universal territory of inspiring personal progress," Mr. Menezes told Campaign magazine.
A quarter-century later, Johnnie Walker, one of the most popular Scotch brands on the planet, still uses the "Keep walking" tagline. Diageo said that Johnnie Walker's retail sales value had increased from about $ 5.1 billion in 2012 to more than $ 8 billion in 2022.
Under Mr. Menezes, Diageo expanded its tequila offerings, trading its Bushmills Irish whiskey brand to Casa Cuervo in 2014 in exchange for complete control of its Don Julio tequila brand and $ 408 million in cash. The company also bought Casamigos, the tequila brand created by George Clooney and two friends, Rande Gerber and Michael Meldman, in a deal in 2017 worth up to $ 1 billion. Tequila is now the company's second-largest seller, after Scotch.
As chief executive Mr. Menezes removed a layer of regional management, facilitating communication between the global company and country-based businesses and shrinking its employee base from about 36,000 to nearly 28,000. He was credited with reducing Diageo's carbon emissions and pushing for greater work force diversity by adding more women at top levels. He had planned to retire this year; the new chief executive is Debra Crew.
She takes the helm as the company faces a recent lawsuit filed by Sean Combs, the rapper known as Diddy, who has accused the company of racial bias for neglecting the vodka and tequila brands they co-own. Diageo denied Mr. Combs's allegations, saying in a statement that "we are confident the facts will show that he has been treated fairly."
Ivan Manuel Menezes was born on July 10, 1959, in Pune, India, to Nina and Manuel Menezes. His mother taught music and French; his father was chairman of the Indian Railway Board.
After graduating from St. Mary's High School in Mount Abu, India, Mr. Menezes earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1979 from St. Stephen's College, the University of Delhi.
He then studied business policy and marketing at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad and took a job with Nestlé in New Delhi in 1981.
He moved to the United States to study business administration at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, completing his master's degree in 1985. He then took a job as a business and management consultant with Booz Allen Hamilton, based in Chicago and London.
Mr. Menezes was vice president of group marketing for Whirlpool in northern Italy from 1992 until he left for Guinness in 1997.
He held several other positions at Diageo, including chief operating officer and president of the company's North American operations, before succeeding Paul S. Walsh as chief executive.
He is survived by his wife, Shibani, with whom he lived in London; two brothers, Victor, the former chairman and chief executive of Citibank, and Michael; a sister, Marisa; a daughter, Rohini Menezes; and a son, Nikhil.
Mr. Menezes, who was a British and American citizen as well as an overseas citizen of India, was knighted by King Charles III in January for his services to business and equality.
When it came to his own taste in beverages, Mr. Menezes preferred classics like a Johnnie Walker Black and soda, or a pint of Guinness, though, as he said during an appearance on CNBC on St. Patrick's Day in 2007, sometimes one was not enough.
"What I will say about Guinness," he said, "my favorite pint is always my next pint."

Why Are Food Prices So High in Europe?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Why Are Food Prices So High in Europe?
It is the most basic of staple food items: sliced white bread. In Britain, the average price of a loaf was 28 percent higher in April, at 1.39 pounds, or $ 1.72, than it was a year earlier.
In Italy, the price of spaghetti and other pasta, a fixture of the Italian diet, has risen nearly 17 percent from the year before. In Germany, the European Union's largest economy, cheese prices are nearly 40 percent higher than a year ago, and potatoes cost 14 percent more.
Throughout the European Union, consumer food prices were on average nearly 17 percent higher in April than a year earlier, a slight slowdown from the previous month, which set the fastest pace of growth in over two and a half decades. The situation is worse in Britain than in its Western European neighbors: Food and nonalcoholic drink prices were 19 percent higher, the quickest pace of annual food inflation in more than 45 years. By comparison, the annual rate of U.S. food inflation was 7.7 percent.
Persistent food inflation is squeezing low-income households and troubling European politicians. (In Italy, the government held a meeting this month to discuss soaring pasta prices.)
At the same time, the major costs that go into making food products, including fuel, wheat and other agricultural commodities, have been falling in international markets for much of the past year -- raising questions about why food prices for consumers remain so high in Europe. And with rising labor costs and the possibility of profiteering, food prices are unlikely to come down anytime soon. More broadly, rising prices could also put pressure on central banks to keep interest rates high, potentially restraining economic growth.
What is driving up food prices?
Behind the sticker price for a loaf of bread includes the costs for not only key ingredients but also processing, packaging, transport, wages, storage and company markups.
A United Nations index of global food commodity prices, such as wheat, meat and vegetable oil, peaked in March 2022, immediately after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which is one of the largest grain producers. The war disrupted grain and oil production in the region and had global impact, too, worsening food crises in parts of East Africa and the Middle East.
But the worst was avoided, in part because of a deal to export grain from Ukraine. European wheat prices have declined about 40 percent since last May. Global vegetable oil prices are down about 50 percent. But there is still a ways to go: The United Nations' food price index was 34 percent higher in April than its 2019 average.
Aside from commodity prices, Europe has experienced particularly harsh increases in costs along the food supply chain.
Energy prices soared because the war forced Europe to rapidly replace Russian gas with new supplies, pushing up the costs of food production, transport and storage.
Though wholesale energy prices have fallen back down recently, retailers warn there's a long lag -- perhaps up to a year -- before consumers will see the benefits of that because energy contracts were made months before, most likely reflecting those higher prices.
And the tight labor markets in Europe with high job vacancy rates and low levels of unemployment are forcing employers, including food companies, to push up wages to attract workers. This in turn drives up costs for businesses, including in the food sector.
Is profiteering keeping prices high?
Suspicions are growing among consumers, trade unions and some economists that inflation could be kept needlessly high by companies raising prices above their costs to protect profit margins. The European Central Bank said that at the end of last year, corporate profits were contributing to domestic inflation as much as wage growth, but it did not say if any industries had made excessive profits.
Economists at Allianz, the German insurer and asset manager, estimate that 10 to 20 percent of food inflation in Europe can be attributed to profiteering. "There is part of the food price inflation that we see which is not explainable, easily," said Ludovic Subran, the chief economist at Allianz.
But the lack of detailed data about corporate profits and supply chains has caused a rift in economic opinions.
Some economists and food retailers have pointed fingers at big global food producers, which have sustained double-digit profit margins while raising prices. In April, the Swiss giant Nestlé said it expected its profit margin this year to be about the same as it was last year, about 17 percent, while it reported raising prices almost 10 percent in the first quarter.
Even taking into account expenses like transport and accounting for pricing lags from farms to shelves, Mr. Subran said he would have expected food inflation to come down by now.
In Britain, some economists are telling a different story. Michael Saunders, an economist at Oxford Economics and former rate-setter at the Bank of England, said in a note to clients in May that "greedflation" was not the culprit. Most of the increase in inflation reflects the higher cost of energy and other commodities, he said.
Rather than rising, total profits for nonfinancial companies in Britain, excluding the oil and gas industry, have fallen over the past year, he said.
Britain's competition regulator also said that it hadn't seen evidence of competition concerns in the grocery sector, but that it was stepping up its investigation into "cost of living pressures."
Have food prices peaked?
Despite well-publicized cuts to milk prices in Britain, food prices in general are unlikely to go down in the near future.
Instead, policymakers are closely watching for a slowdown in the rate of increases.
There are tentative signs that the pace of food inflation -- the double-digit increase in annual prices -- has reached its pinnacle. In April, the rate fell in the European Union for the first time in two years.
But the slowdown from here is likely to be gradual.
"It appears to be taking longer for food price pressures to work their way through the system this time than we had expected," Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said this month.
Across the continent, some governments are intervening by capping prices on food essentials, rather than waiting for the economic debates about corporate profiteering to play out. In France, the government is pushing an "anti-inflation quarter," asking food retailers to cut prices on some products until June. But the finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said this month that he wanted food producers to contribute more to the effort, warning they could face tax penalties to recover any margins unfairly made at the expense of consumers if they refuse to return to negotiations.
These efforts may help some shoppers, but on the whole there is little to comfort Europeans. Food prices are unlikely to decline -- it's likely only that the pace of increases will slow later this year.

When Water Needs a Recipe: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: When Brigette Ramirez and her family drove to Houston for a Taylor Swift concert, she made a very important pit stop. Three, actually: T.J. Maxx, T.J. Maxx and T.J. Maxx.
Mx. Ramirez, 33, an 11th-grade U.S. history teacher, was on the hunt for the sugar-free syrups that her fellow flavored-water enthusiasts had cleaned out from the only T.J. Maxx near her home in South Texas.
Her plan was to add them to tap water, pour the concoction into a Stanley tumbler, film herself doing it and (hopefully) go viral on TikTok.
"I ended up finding really good syrups there," she said.
In this latest chapter of America's obsession with hydration, the thirsty are zhuzhing up tap water for all to see on TikTok under the banner of #WaterTok. They show off elaborately organized "water bars" stocked with sugar-free syrups, low-calorie powders flavored like Skittles and Nerds candy, and brightly colored tumblers.
Some have become influencers in the process. Just one of these water mixologists' "recipes" -- three squirts of this, a packet of that -- has the power to significantly drive sales. Several water flavoring companies said they sold out of products in the past few months, and revenue is booming as a result.
"There was a time where our Stur coconut pineapple was sold out for a few weeks because some people were making a Dole Whip drink with it," said Neel Premkumar, the founder of Stur, which sells drink mixes that use natural ingredients.
He said that Stur's revenue has more than doubled in the first four months of this year compared with the last four months of 2022.
Since #WaterTok took off in March, Jordan's Skinny Mixes has sold out of its bright blue, sugar-free Mermaid syrup, with hints of citrus, pineapple and coconut, eight times.
The company was founded 14 years ago and saw growth over the course of the pandemic, said Dana Paris, its chief marketing officer. But #WaterTok "helped bolster Jordan's Skinny Mixes from this secret little brand into more of a household name," she said. In April, e-commerce sales were up 143 percent compared with last year.
Its website opens with a banner acknowledging the trend: "Ride the WAVE as we (and all of TikTok) get hydrated deliciously!" It also includes an apology when a customer goes to order: "NOTICE: EXPECT SHIPMENT DELAY."
In a private Skinny Mixes-dedicated Facebook group, enthusiasts trade tips on where to buy the syrups and exchange water recipes.
Meagan Anderson, an over-40 lifestyle influencer who makes #WaterTok videos and lives outside of Fort Worth, Texas, said people will go to three different stores just to look for flavors.
"Shelves are getting wiped out," said Ms. Anderson, 48.
Sales of Torani's sugar-free coconut syrup have doubled since March, said Andrea Ramirez, the consumer and customer market insight manager. The company has been around since 1925 and is perhaps most famous for its coffee flavorings.
Last month, Ms. Ramirez conducted primary research into the water trend "because it was such a strange phenomenon," she said. She presented her findings with a PowerPoint titled "Let's Talk WATERTOK."
The trend was initially met with mockery across the internet, and critics have dismissed #WaterTok enthusiasts as "hummingbirds," which several influencers said felt sexist.
Those pushing these syrups and powders often have their own affiliate links for products, and the sponsorship component has also inspired some backlash, said Tiffany Ferguson, the creator of the YouTube show "Internet Analysis," in which she dives deep into popular online trends.
"You're like: 'What's in it for you?"' said Ms. Ferguson, 27. "'Why are you so excited? Why are you acting like this water is your church?"'
If #WaterTok is a sect, hydration is a national religion.
In the past decade or so, water-flavoring offerings have exploded in the United States, where Big Soda has dominated the American palate for generations.
These water additive companies frame products -- which are often made with artificial sweeteners and flavorings -- as a way to help people hit their hydration goals. It's Mary Poppins logic: A spoonful of (sugar-free coconut syrup) makes the (tap water) go down.
"For me, I feel like it's drinking my own saliva," said Mx. Ramirez, the history teacher from South Texas, of tap water.
"In my house, we used to be avid Dr Pepper Zero or Diet Coke drinkers," Mx. Ramirez said. "Avid. Like we would buy bulk." Since she switched to flavored water, she said, three cases of soda have sat untouched in the pantry.
#WaterTok is also associated with gastric surgery. Patients are not supposed to drink carbonated beverages after weight-loss surgery, so still flavored drinks can be a hydration tool -- especially for patients who previously relied on soda.
"The whole world is trying to drink more water," said Tonya Spanglo, 45, who had weight-loss surgery three years ago and is arguably the most recognizable face of #WaterTok. "This is just a fun way to do something that we're already doing."
Hydration chatter online is inextricable from diet culture.
The hashtag #WaterTok often nestles up next to #WeightLoss, as influencers lift up hydration as a key tool in their quest to shed pounds. On Monday, the World Health Organization warned against using artificial sweeteners for weight loss, saying that continued consumption could increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mortality in adults.
And one question remains: Is any of it even water?
"I have some pause with regards to calling this 'water,"' said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity medicine physician and scientist at Harvard. "Because it isn't just water."
Water, she helpfully defined, is "what you would expect if you were to take a shower, or wash your hands."
"Water is the base," she said. "But water is the base for soda, too."

Full text: This one-skillet dinner has the bright flavors of a salade Niçoise but is more substantial, so you can eat it all year long. A mix of exciting textures includes tender salmon and orzo, snappy green beans and juicy tomatoes.
Time: 35 minutes
Yield: 4 servings 1 large shallot, coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup orzo
Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
½ cup pitted kalamata olives
1 pint cherry or other small tomatoes, halved (8 to 10 ounces)
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
Handful of basil leaves or pinch of thyme leaves (optional)
4 (4- to 5-ounce) salmon fillets, skin on or off
8 ounces green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths 1. Transfer 1 tablespoon of the chopped shallot to a medium bowl, then add the remaining shallot to a large (12-inch) skillet. Add 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet and heat over medium-high. When the oil is sizzling, add the orzo, season with ½ teaspoon each salt and pepper, and stir constantly until light golden, 2 to 4 minutes. 2. Add the olives plus 2¼ cups water; bring to a boil, then cover the skillet with a lid, baking sheet or foil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook according to package directions until the orzo is al dente. 3. Add the tomatoes, red wine vinegar, mustard, herbs (if using) and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the reserved shallots in the bowl; season to taste with salt and pepper, then set aside. Season the salmon with salt and pepper. 4. When the orzo is al dente, add the green beans and stir to combine. If orzo looks dry, add ¼ cup water; you want it to be wet but not soupy. Nestle the salmon in a single layer into the orzo, skin-side up if applicable. Cover and cook until the salmon and orzo are cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit, covered, for 2 minutes. If your salmon has skin, peel it off and discard. Top the orzo and salmon with the tomatoes and vinaigrette.

Cutting Back as Food Costs Go Up, Up, Up: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some of the biggest packaged food companies raised their prices last quarter and their profits rose, but some customers were starting to cut back or trade down.
Brenetta Smith used to buy brand-name foods like Oreos and Doritos without thinking twice. But when she noticed that food prices at her local supermarket, Aldi, were soaring, she realized she had to do something different: "I have to change the way I shop," she said.
So Ms. Smith, 40, a stay-at-home parent in Memphis, started stocking up on dry goods like rice and flour, freezing meat that she bought on sale and avoiding packaged foods, which meant no more Oreos and Doritos. "We've cut out all of the snacks," she said.
Now that she has developed new habits and found that her approach helps stretch her husband's salary as a cable technician, she doesn't plan to go back to her old ways.
"Even when the world returns to normal, you can still maximize your paycheck and your income," Ms. Smith said. She started posting budget tips on TikTok in December, and she quickly amassed a following.
Americans have faced substantial inflation at grocery stores and restaurants. Over the past year, overall food prices were up 8.5 percent as consumers paid more for staples like eggs, fruit and meat.
And corporations that wrested back pricing power during the pandemic may be reluctant to give it up. In earnings reports over the past week, some of the biggest packaged food companies said they raised their prices last quarter and saw their profits go up.
But there have been signs that consumers are starting to resist price increases by cutting back or trading down to lower-priced options. Some of the same multinational companies that raised prices on food said the volume they sold went down.
Brands risk alienating consumers with these high prices, said Sucharita Kodali, a retail analyst at Forrester. "Customers may or may not come back," she said. "At some point, they will say enough is enough."
For now, many major companies are raising prices enough that gains are offsetting drops in sales volume. PepsiCo, which makes products like Quaker Oats and Cheetos, said on Tuesday that it increased prices 16 percent in the latest quarter, helping its profit grow 18 percent (excluding its sale of a juice company last year), even as volume fell 2 percent.
Nestlé, whose portfolio includes Hot Pockets and Perrier water, said on Tuesday that it increased its prices 9.8 percent in the last quarter but that volume fell half a percent -- an improvement from the prior quarter, when volume dropped 2.6 percent.
And on Thursday, Unilever, the consumer goods giant that makes about a third of its revenue from food brands, announced that it had raised prices 13.4 percent on items like Hellmann's mayonnaise, and that volume fell 1.3 percent.
So far, "what we are seeing is the willingness to pay up for things you need," said Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets, adding that items like milk and perishable groceries must be replenished often.
But consumers may start reallocating their spending. "For companies that are able to maintain price elevation, they're going to see their profits go higher," he added.
Coca-Cola, for example, raised prices last quarter, and its profit jumped 12 percent, to $ 3.1 billion.
In general, consumers are continuing to spend. The U.S. economy grew at a 1.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday, the third consecutive quarter of growth after output went down in the first half of last year.
And food inflation has been abating. In March, food prices were flat compared with the month before, according to the Consumer Price Index, and prices for food at home fell 0.3 percent. But prices at restaurants continued to go up, rising 0.6 percent from February.
Still, some customers are changing their buying habits. Kylie Park, 31, used to buy three or four boxes of Pop-Tarts Bites for her son on trips to her local Safeway in Oahu, Hawaii. But the treats have become more expensive, so she often buys just one package at a time. She also stopped buying as much juice, she said, and has been skipping her trips to Costco for bulk goods.
"Before, I would overbuy; I realized I don't need all of that," said Ms. Park, who works as a part-time aesthetician and content creator. "I don't think I would go back."
She added that she had mostly just paid the higher prices on staples, allocating more of her budget to groceries. "Everything I buy is normally everything we eat," she said.
Other consumers are opting to buy cheaper generic products. When companies raise prices too much, consumers seek alternatives, Ms. Kodali said. "You basically introduced a bunch of people who were your audience to your competitors," she said. "What you end up seeing is a trade-off."
Dianna Anderson's attitude toward cereal brands used to be: "If I can't get the name brand, I won't get it." But when inflation started eroding their breakfast budget, Mx. Anderson, 37, who uses they/them pronouns, started buying generic cereal at Target.
"I would probably stick with the Target brand," said Mx. Anderson, a writer who works at a nonprofit organization in Minneapolis. "It's a decent product, and it's cheaper."
Fast food restaurants have likewise seen profits rise as they raise prices.
McDonald's announced this week that it had "strategic menu price increases" in the recent quarter. Same-store sales were up 12.6 percent, and its profit rose 63 percent from a year earlier, to $ 1.8 billion. But the company acknowledged that some customers were cutting back.
"I'm really proud of how our system has executed pricing in light of the double-digit inflation that we have been experiencing," Christopher J. Kempczinski, chief executive of McDonald's, said on a call with analysts.
He added that the number of items per order was decreasing slightly -- some customers were opting not to add fries. "We are seeing, in some places, resistance to pricing, more resistance than we saw at the outset," he said.
Ms. Park is among those resisting. She used to go to McDonald's, her favorite fast food spot, during her lunch break every week, she said. But when she noticed last summer that prices were climbing and portions appeared small, she cut back to once a month.
"Filet-O-Fish is my favorite ever," Ms. Park said. "It feels like we're losing out."
At Chipotle, which has been raising prices for more than a year, average menu prices were up 10 percent last quarter from the previous year, and profit was 84 percent higher. The company also expanded its profit margin, and sales were up.
"I think we've now demonstrated we do have pricing power," Brian Niccol, the chief executive of Chipotle, said on a call with analysts this week. "We have a really strong brand, and we don't want to be in front of the inflationary environment, but we also don't want to fall behind."
Not everyone is happy with the higher costs at Chipotle.
Amy Scalf, 37, was shocked to find that her burrito bowl with guacamole cost more than $ 11 at a Chipotle near her home in Lexington, Ky. Ms. Scalf, who offers saving tips on social media, said she might start going to Taco Bell instead.
"It's definitely a deterrent," she said of the higher prices. "It's an incentive to go and get an option that's cheaper."
Photograph When prices at her grocery store started to rise, Brenetta Smith of Memphis began avoiding packaged foods to save money -- no more Oreos, no more Doritos. "We've cut out all of the snacks," said Ms. Smith, 40, a stay-at-home parent.

U.S. Vows Crackdown
On Illegal A.I. Practices
The government will "not hesitate to crack down" on harmful business practices involving artificial intelligence, the head of the Federal Trade Commission warned Tuesday in a message partly directed at the developers of widely used A.I. tools such as ChatGPT.
Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, joined top officials from civil rights and consumer protection agencies to put businesses on notice that regulators are working to track and stop illegal behavior in the use and development of biased or deceptive A.I. tools.
Much of the scrutiny has been on those who deploy automated tools that amplify bias in decisions about who to hire, how worker productivity is monitored or who gets access to housing and loans.
But Ms. Khan also raised the possibility of the F.T.C. wielding its antitrust authority to protect competition, adding that the commission would watch for "unfair, deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition." ASSOCIATED PRESS

PepsiCo Beats Forecasts,
Helped by Price Increases
PepsiCo raised its annual forecasts on Tuesday after price increases undertaken to offset higher costs and steady demand helped the company's first-quarter results beat estimates.
The results pointed to a resilient consumer and followed similar quarterly performances by Coca-Cola and Nestlé. PepsiCo's shares rose more than 2 percent in trading on Tuesday.
Sales in the North America beverage unit, PepsiCo's largest business, rose 8 percent in the quarter. Net revenue rose 10 percent to $ 17.85 billion, topping estimates of $ 17.22 billion. Adjusted profit of $ 1.50 per share also beat estimates of $ 1.39. Average prices jumped 16 percent in the first quarter, PepsiCo said.
PepsiCo expects 2023 revenue to rise 8 percent, compared with its prior forecast of 6 percent.
Global consumer goods companies have raised prices since the pandemic to battle a jump in costs of raw materials, labor and shipping. PepsiCo also plans to raise prices in some regions, in contrast to an earlier decision to hit a pause. REUTERS

McDonald's Customers
Buoy Sales in Quarter
McDonald's reported higher-than-expected sales in the first quarter as store traffic grew despite higher prices.
Global same-store sales rose 12.6 percent compared to the January-March period last year, the Chicago burger giant said Tuesday, well above the 8.7 percent increase analysts forecast.
Good weather in January helped increase sales. There was also a steady recovery in China after Covid restrictions were lifted, McDonald's said.
Marketing campaigns, like a McSpicy chicken sandwich promotion with a streetwear brand in China, and a Valentine's Day meal promotion in the U.S. with rappers Offset and Cardi B, also buoyed the chain's performance.
Chris Kempczinski, the chief executive, said McDonald's was starting to see price resistance. Customers may not add fries to an order, for example, and delivery orders have slowed, he said.

Gourmet Dog Foods Perk Up Ears Of Humans, but Will Fido Dig In?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Like so many 2-year-olds, Bear is a picky eater.
When Bear, a 120-pound Great Pyrenees, seemed bored with the dry food his owner, Margaret Pless, fed him day after day, she gave him canned food from Costco. Bear hated it. Next, she tried pricey refrigerated dog food. When that failed to please Bear's palate, Ms. Pless made his food for a few months. He liked it, but it was an exhausting, time-consuming process, and she was left wondering whether Bear was getting all the nutrients he needed.
So in November 2021, Ms. Pless signed up for a subscription to The Farmer's Dog, which provides customized dog food marketed as made with human-grade ingredients. The recipe list reads more like a homemade stew: beef or turkey with vegetables, such as carrots and brussels sprouts. The food is cooked at low temperatures before being portioned out and shipped to Ms. Pless's home in Dover, Mass.
"The company made claims that dogs would love this food and never get tired of it," said Ms. Pless, a part-time church administrator and dog boarder, who said she was spending up to $ 13 per day feeding Bear the human-grade food, up from the dry-food cost of around $ 3 per day.
But Bear was unimpressed. "At first he was excited," Ms. Pless said. "And then he was like, 'Oh, it's this stuff again,' and he got bored."
Dog ownership boomed during the pandemic, with Americans buying or adopting millions of pets, including canines. Sales of dog food surged to around $ 25 billion last year, up nearly 39 percent from $ 18 billion in 2019, according to the consumer research firm NIQ.
But as inflation has driven up the prices of even conventional kibble, the options in the dog food aisle have become increasingly bespoke and expensive. There are holistic, plant-based varieties, and those with freeze-dried goat and wild boar. Some options are frozen and raw. Last year, "Saturday Night Live" poked fun at the industry with a skit featuring a couple in a grocery store chiding another shopper for not feeding her pet "real food."
One of the fastest-growing and most competitive categories is human-grade dog food, such as the kind Ms. Pless bought for Bear from The Farmer's Dog. According to the Association of American Feed Control Officials, a nongovernmental organization that provides guidance to the industry on animal feeds, human-grade dog food contains fresh ingredients -- like meats or vegetables -- that are fit for human consumption, and is manufactured in a plant that is federally regulated and inspected.
Although humans can technically eat human-grade dog food, it may contain nutrients that are not suitable for people, said Austin Therrell, the organization's executive director.
Companies like The Farmer's Dog, Ollie and others are marketing their fresh pet food as less processed and more closely resembling human diets. Veterinarians and animal nutritionists say many of these new brands are targeting wealthier consumers who treat their animals as if they were children -- so-called fur babies -- and want to match their dogs' diets to their own eating habits. Some are selling the food directly to consumers, through subscription services.
These fresh-food makers are also benefiting from a wave of distrust among certain dog owners over the concentration of large companies dominating the pet food industry. Dry kibble is typically made from surplus meats and byproducts, like livers and kidneys, from the human food industry. Wet and dry ingredients are mixed to form a dough that is heated under pressure and pushed through a die machine that cuts it into the kibble pieces.
The family-owned Mars may be best known for Snickers, M&Ms and Wrigley chewing gum, but those brands have been eclipsed by its pet business, which includes more than 1,000 VCA Animal Care hospitals nationwide and food brands like Royal Canin and Pedigree. Likewise, Purina pet food and care, owned by Nestlé, was one of the largest and fastest-growing categories last year for the food giant. This year, the cereal company Post Holdings plans to buy the pet food brands Rachael Ray Nutrish, 9 Lives and others from J.M. Smucker for $ 1.2 billion.
"There are definitely a ton of new pet food products on the market and more coming on every day," said Cailin Heinze, a board-certified veterinary nutritionist and executive director of the Mark Morris Institute, a nonprofit organization that provides education on pet nutrition to veterinarians. The institute is funded by Hill's Pet Nutrition, which is owned by Colgate-Palmolive.
Dr. Heinze said that while many of the newer brands claimed to be less processed or to contain "real ingredients," there was little research showing that they were more nutritious than the dry or canned dog food that millions of Americans had been feeding their pets for decades.
"Many are pushing natural or healthy, and people look at the ingredient list and assume because they recognize everything that the diet has to be healthier," Dr. Heinze said. "It's giving these companies a health halo, even if there is no science behind it, and the other diet has 40 years of research."
One area of particular concern is dog food marketed as "grain free." Much of it contains high levels of peas, lentils and other legumes that may be linked to an increased risk of cardiac disease in dogs. The Food and Drug Administration said it did not have "sufficient data" to find a link and encouraged continued research.
"There are many different ways to provide good nutrition for a dog," said Jonathan Regev, who started The Farmer's Dog in 2014 with Brett Podolsky, after Mr. Podolsky's dog had stomach issues that his veterinarian believed were caused by the dog's food. The Farmer's Dog uses a variety of proteins, vegetables and occasionally legumes in its products.
Joseph Wakshlag, a professor at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, worked as a consultant with The Farmer's Dog on its recipes. Mr. Wakshlag said in an email that many human-grade and refrigerated dog foods were "nice options, as long as they are complete and balanced." He added that they were sometimes higher in fat and protein, which is fine for healthy dogs but may not work for dogs with certain medical conditions.
After Patrick and Jennifer Cunningham, both physicians in a Chicago suburb, saw the Farmer's Dog commercial during this year's Super Bowl, they gave it to their Shih Tzus, Strudel and Machiavelli.
The dogs are converts. "They don't like it; they love it," Dr. Cunningham said. "Strudel gets so excited. She doesn't quite howl but yelps with joy when we are mixing it."
Dr. Cunningham estimates that he is spending about $ 100 a month on the human-grade food versus $ 40 for dry kibble.
For Bear, though, The Farmer's Dog did not live up to his owner's high hopes. After spending $ 9 to $ 13 per day on it for six months, plus dry kibble, Ms. Pless canceled her subscription. She has gone back to regular bags of dry kibble and rotating them when Bear becomes bored.
"Bottom line: I don't believe that dog foods made with human-grade ingredients are more effective than regular kinds of dog food," Ms. Pless said. "There are many premium dog foods that are not made with human-grade ingredients that work just as well for a lower price."

Like so many 2-year-olds, Bear is a picky eater.
When the 120-pound Great Pyrenees seemed bored with the dry food his owner, Margaret Pless, fed him day after day, she gave him canned food from Costco. Bear hated it. Next, she tried pricey refrigerated dog food. When that failed to please Bear’s palate, Pless made his food for a few months. He liked it, but it was an exhausting, time-consuming process, and she was left wondering whether Bear was getting all the nutrients he needed.
So in November 2021, Pless signed up for a subscription to the Farmer’s Dog, which provides customized dog food marketed as made with human-grade ingredients. The recipe list reads like a homemade stew: beef or turkey with vegetables, such as carrots and Brussels sprouts. The food is cooked at low temperatures before being portioned out and shipped to Pless’ home in Dover, Massachusetts.
“The company made claims that dogs would love this food and never get tired of it,” said Pless, a part-time church administrator and dog boarder, who said she was spending up to $13 per day feeding Bear the human-grade food, up from the dry-food cost of around $3 per day.
But Bear was unimpressed.
“At first he was excited,” Pless said. “And then he was like, ‘Oh, it’s this stuff again,’ and he got bored.”
Dog ownership boomed during the pandemic, with Americans buying or adopting millions of pets, including canines. Sales of dog food surged to around $25 billion last year, up nearly 39% from $18 billion in 2019, according to the consumer research firm NIQ.
But as inflation has driven up the prices of even conventional kibble, the options in the dog food aisle have become increasingly bespoke and expensive.

Is That a TV on the Dashboard?: [Style Desk]

Full text: As luxury cars become rolling supercomputers, designers are wondering how big is too big.
From pocket-stretching smartphones to wall-hogging TVs, Americans have often asked: How much screen is too much?
The question has come to today's gadget-stuffed cars, whose increasingly colossal screens are splitting opinions among designers, car buyers and industry critics. These do-it-all touch screens, the nerve centers of many new cars, have sparked a backlash because of their size, as well as the clunky interfaces that may take eyes off the road.
"I think we've reached Peak Screen," said Klaus Busse, Maserati's head of design, who previously led design for Alfa Romeo, Fiat and Lancia. "Screens have their right of existence -- they do a lot of things better than physical switches. It's just been pushed a little too far."
Beyond having ergonomic and safety concerns, some luxury designers object on aesthetic grounds. To them, screens just aren't sexy or luxurious.
"When flat screens showed up, the-bigger-the-better was the trend," said Kai Langer, head of design for BMW i, the automaker's electric division. "But 'bigger' isn't always the richest."
Screens are now integral to most modern cars, which are more or less rolling supercomputers, running up to 14 times more code than a Boeing 787. And designers must keep in mind the demands of car owners who expect that their Apple or Android smartphones will hook up flawlessly.
"Steve Jobs changed the world, and now mankind touches a screen," said Gorden Wagener, the chief designer for Mercedes-Benz. "That fundamentally changes the car as well. The car needs a good interface, not just a wiper switch and turn indicator."
When Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Model S in 2009, the command center, with its 17-inch LCD touch screen, seemed nearly as game-changing as the car itself. And in giving drivers digital control of automotive functions, Tesla was able to avoid the expense of engineering, wiring and building a cabin full of pricey analog switches, knobs and gauges -- or having to buy them from another automaker or supplier.
In Tesla's bare-bones Model 3 and Model Y especially, one might suspect that interior designers worked overtime on their ingenious screens and then called it a day. A number of Tesla's competitors mimicked the cabins' austere, vaguely sci-fi vibe.
The creators of later electric vehicles -- including BMW's futuristic yet sumptuous iX and the Kia EV6 -- came up with warmer car interiors better suited to drivers who may not want to feel as if they are spending hours inside the mainframe from "Tron." Some designers are even ditching that most played-out of E.V. tropes, the Mac-like monochromes of gray-silver-white.
With its expanded touch screen, Tesla also spurred an arms race measured in inches. Ford stuffed a 15.5-inch screen into its Mustang Mach-e and F-150 Lightning E.V.s. The start-up Rivian has installed a 16-inch display in the R1T and R1S models. Another California company, Lucid, created a 34-inch, curved-glass screen for the Air sedan.
And then there is the "Hyperscreen," from Mercedes-Benz.
Powered by eight processors, framed under a sculptural slab of double-coated glass, the Hyperscreen (actually three screens that appear as one) spreads 56 inches of digital interface across the dashboard. Augmented-reality navigation generates virtual street signs and directional guides over the pavement in a real-time camera view. Almost magically, virtual address numbers hover over homes and businesses as you approach a destination.
Yet the Hyperscreen doesn't always work as elegantly as it looks -- especially when drivers are, well, driving. Issues include fussy thumb-pad controls on the steering wheel and moments of hair-pulling confusion, especially for customers who grew up with predigital rides. Mr. Wagener said that Mercedes intentionally launched its Hyperscreen in its electric vehicles to aim it at tech-savvy customers.
BMW is no stranger to screens, having ushered in iDrive more than 20 years ago on the 7-Series sedan. That digital operating system, with a now-quaint 6.5-inch screen atop the dashboard, infuriated many drivers because it was so hard to use. But as BMW refined it over the years, rival car companies adopted similar systems.
The i7 sedan, a new electric model from BMW, wraps a curved screen around the driver. The back of the car offers a 31-inch, fold-down theater touch screen, with 5G connectivity and Amazon Fire for streaming. Another 5.5-inch screen nestles into each rear armrest.
At the annual CES in Las Vegas in January, BMW threw down that gauntlet by going well beyond the touch screen. In the iVision Dee, a concept sedan that previews a range of BMW "Neue Klasse" E.V.s -- the first scheduled to arrive in 2025 -- the windshield itself takes the place of a dashboard touch screen.
"Let's use the biggest display we already have in a car, which is the windshield," Mr. Langer, the BMW design chief, said.
The augmented-reality windshield allows for "Minority Report"-style projections of traditional gauges (speedometer; temperature settings; audio displays) and social-and-streaming content. The system, which BMW will call Panoramic Vision on showroom models, greatly expands the head-up displays that project content into the field of view, allowing drivers to check the controls without looking away from the road.
For those leery of astral projections blocking their view of I-95, Mr. Langer said that drivers could choose any display level. A "mixed reality slider" can limit traditional information, such as a speedometer, to a thin strip of lower windshield, where today's head-up displays already operate. Drivers more at ease with digital projections can fill more of the windshield glass with content. When the car isn't moving, including during charging stops, passengers may eventually use the entire windshield like a virtual drive-in for movies, games, Zoom meetings or trips to the metaverse.
At the convention in Las Vegas, the BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said he was convinced that regulators would eventually ban large dashboard screens because of safety concerns. "If you have to look down to operate your car, we think it's a big mistake," he told Automotive News Europe.
Mr. Langer noted that prominent screens do not appear in the pages of high-end shelter or architectural magazines. "None of our consumers would want to cover their living room in screens," he said. "They want their Eames chair or Nelson clock. And we want our customers to feel at home."
And if touch screens shrink or even disappear from cars' cabins, designers will be free to reclaim the interiors for something more aesthetically pleasing. "A touch screen doesn't speak to our senses," Mr. Langer said. "We're made to touch fabrics and sense different surfaces; that's what makes us human."
Some of the iVision Dee's fanciful tech -- including a chameleon-like body that can instantly change to one of 32 colors -- may be ditched or watered down in production versions. Yet BMW vows the panoramic display is bound for showrooms.
Mercedes-Benz is skeptical. While it offers head-up displays, it is convinced that windshield projections "are light-years behind the quality and resolution you can achieve on a screen," Mr. Wagener said.
"It's certainly an innovative approach," he continued. "But we've tried it, and it's disturbing or disorienting to have all that in your viewing area."
Maserati is steering a middle course with its GranTurismo. Its interior includes a pair of screens that don't draw attention to themselves.
"We don't want a screen to be the main protagonist," Mr. Busse, the Maserati design chief, said.
In his view, the car is a refuge from the digital world and its pressures.
"For us," he said, "it's still about the driving experience -- to enjoy this beautiful machine and the countryside where you're operating it."

Ivanka Trump Is Pained: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: We've talked plenty about how Donald Trump's indictment and arraignment might affect his latest presidential bid. We've pondered their meaning for the future of the republic.
But "whither America?" isn't the question. Whither Ivanka? A fair-haired, fair-weather daughter has allegiances to re-examine and decisions to make, and not just about what to wear if there are jailhouse visits to come. Right here, right now, does she stand by Daddy? Or does she treat Mar-a-Lago as if it were Three Mile Island and run as fast and as far from it as she can?
Nepotism was never supposed to be this hard.
I ache for Ivanka. But mostly, I marvel at her -- and at the many, many people like her who have a special talent, a preternatural discipline, for pausing at every pivotal crossroads and making a coldblooded, single-minded assessment: How do I navigate this to maximum advantage for me?
Ivanka navigates like Magellan. She's GPS made flesh. At times, the coordinates and calculations have been easy: Daddy's going to the White House; I will not be left behind. She traipsed after him to Washington. She traipsed after him to meetings with European leaders. She even traipsed after him to the Demilitarized Zone. She did so much traipsing that Twitter had a hashtag for it: #unwantedivanka. And then Daddy was dethroned, and the traipsing just wasn't what it used to be.
Things got tricky: Daddy sent those ruffians to the Capitol, where they made a horrible mess and threatened to maul Mike Pence. Ivanka recalculated. For her appearance before the Jan. 6 committee, she wore a glimmer of disapproval.
And now, well, there's no figuring out where to turn or whom to burn. Daddy was just hauled into a Manhattan courthouse because of that smuttiness with the porn star. Can Ivanka play the part of a distracted onlooker without seeming like a 24-karat ingrate?
Nothing good for her can come of this, so she's saying and doing almost nothing at all. She's in limbo. She's in hiding. She has gone from gaga to Garbo and wants to be left alone, at least until the Stormy weather clears.
She did, according to a report in The New York Post, visit Daddy at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday. And last week, following his indictment, she put out that statement about it on Instagram. But it read as though it were written by a chatbot getting a pedicure. It comprised just 27 weightless, gutless, exquisitely noncommittal words -- about loving Daddy, about loving America, about being "pained." His indictment is a kidney stone to be passed.
And she's the patron saint of all the unscrupulous opportunists who are taking little or big steps away from Daddy but contentedly ignored his depravity and destructiveness when there was power to be gained from that. When there was a profit to be made.
The day of Donald Trump's indictment, a team of Times journalists reported that wealth funds in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar had invested hundreds of millions of dollars with a private equity firm that Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner, started not long after he and she left the White House, where they had cultivated close ties to the Arab world.
That's the bonanza that Ivanka R.S.V.P.'d to, not the bedlam since November 2020, not the ravings of Sidney Powell, the rioter in Viking horns, that wacky Waco rally, all these icky criminal cases.
For Daddy's current presidential campaign, she sent her regrets. "This time around," she said in a statement released the same night he announced his candidacy, "I am choosing to prioritize my young children." Were they not priorities before?
She added that she didn't "plan to be involved in politics." The thing about plans is they can change. Ivanka's vanishing act is a testament to that.
Her brothers are picking up any slack. Their reactions to Daddy's indictment were as insane as hers was insipid. "This is stuff that would make Mao, Stalin, Pol Pot -- it would make them blush," Donald Jr. said.
Pol Pot? Junior and I clearly had different history teachers, and there are gaps in his moviegoing that cry out for filling. Note to self: Send him a DVD or link to "The Killing Fields."
It's a cracked political religion that the Brothers Trump practice, but at least they're keeping the faith. Their sister has strayed. She always wanted all the glory without any of the sacrifice, Air Force One without the gale-force controversies, the big, bright stage that Daddy gave her without the critics' pans. She always insisted that her transaction with him -- oops, I mean relationship -- keep her in the black.
It's not doing that anymore, so she's establishing distance and projecting detachment, but in a pained way, with all that love in her heart. #unwantedivanka wants to turn the page. She may find that impossible when the text is this soiled.

For the Love of Sentences
Usually, I reach back no more than about two weeks for these prose snippets, confined to examples of very recent journalism. But my March leave from the newsletter meant no "Love of Sentences" for a month, so I'm reaching back as far as late February this week. And considering how long it has been since we loved sentences together, I'm sharing more snippets than I usually do.
Anthony Lane had great fun reviewing the movie "Cocaine Bear," which lends new definition to the phrase "high concept": "Allegedly, it's based on true events, in much the same way that 'Pinocchio' is based on string theory." Also: "The animal kingdom is represented by a butterfly, a deer and a black bear. Only one of these is on cocaine, although with butterflies you can never really tell." (Thanks to Andrew Rich of Portland, Ore., and Harry Schaefer of Silver Spring, Md., among others, for flagging lines from Lane's appraisal.)
Also in The New Yorker, Nathan Heller described the effect of the internet and smartphones on college students' attention spans: "Assigning 'Middlemarch' in that climate was like trying to land a 747 on a small rural airstrip." (Rudy Brynolfson, Minneapolis, and Marilyn Wilbanks, Ellensburg, Wash.)
In The Wall Street Journal, Peggy Noonan weighed in on the chilliness of Ron DeSantis, who gives her the feeling "that he might unplug your life support to re-charge his cellphone." (Maggi Ashworth Jones, Houston)
In The Washington Post, Eugene Robinson remarked on DeSantis's tortured formulation of a viewpoint about the Russian invasion of Ukraine: "Apparently no one told Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis that if you're going to wade into the deep waters of foreign policy, you should at least know how to dog paddle." (Mary Cooper, Arlington, Va.)
While we're on the subject of DeSantis, Jay Parini reviewed his new book, "The Courage to Be Free," for CNN.com, writing that it takes "the usual dullness" of these exercises in political branding "to a fresh level, redefining what clichéd writing can sound like. It's one thing to offer the public a bit of wooden prose, but DeSantis gives us an entire lumber yard." (Joe Furlong, Muscatine, Iowa)
In The Times, Carlos Lozada pondered the array of enemies that DeSantis identifies in the book: "There's the news media, with modifiers like 'legacy' or 'corporate' adding a nefarious touch. There's Big Tech, that 'censorship arm of the political left,' and the powerful corporations that cave to the 'leftist-rage mob.' There are universities like Harvard and Yale, which DeSantis attended but did not inhale." (Vipan Chandra, Attleboro, Mass.)
Also in The Times, Nate Cohn commented on the uncharted waters of a former president who is also the current front-runner for his party's presidential nomination being indicted: "This is the blurry corner of the map where we can't do much more than draw fantastical sea creatures." (Barbara Reichman, Port Murray, N.J.)
Michelle Goldberg mulled Republicans' obsession with culture war issues: "Ronald Reagan used to describe conservatism as a three-legged stool, comprising social conservatives, fiscal conservatives and defense hawks. These days it looks a lot more like a pogo stick." (Steve Summit, Cambridge, Mass., and Paul McKay, Albemarle, N.C.)
Elizabeth Spiers reflected on Gwyneth Paltrow's aura in the courtroom -- and in life: "This combination of obscene wealth and an affinity for baroque lifestyle routines gives Ms. Paltrow a Marie Antoinette vibe -- if Marie Antoinette thought the hungry should opt for bone broth." (Jo Wollschlaeger, Portland, Ore.)
Michael Wilson recalled Bruce Springsteen's first triumphant run as a headliner at Madison Square Garden in 1978: "He would return more than 40 times in the decades that followed, putting him shoulder-to-shoulder with most every musical act except Billy Joel, who still performs at the Garden frequently enough to have his mail forwarded there." (Arthur Rothstein, San Francisco)
And Nathan Englander contrasted Tom Cruise in his 50s with a typical movie star of that age 50 years ago: "Try Walter Matthau in 'The Taking of Pelham 123.' I'm not saying he wasn't a dreamboat. I'm saying he reflects a life well lived in the company of gravity and pastrami." (Pete Epstein, Mashpee, Mass., and Paul Goldberg, Stamford, Conn.)

What I'm Writing, Doing and Reading
Although I was away from the newsletter in March, I did contribute to Times Opinion in the form of this essay about what's wrong with most college rankings and how many students approach the process of applying to colleges. It's a subject I feel strongly about, as reflected in my 2015 book, "Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be: An Antidote to the College Admissions Mania." My Times essay accompanied Gus Wezerek's thoughtful examination of the good and bad choices that an array of college graduates made and this excellent new tool for personalized college rankings that The Times's Quoctrung Bui and Jessia Ma put together.
At Duke University at 6 p.m. on April 27, I'll have the privilege of interviewing NPR's Nina Totenberg about her book "Dinners With Ruth: A Memoir on the Power of Friendships" and related matters. Although the event is free and open to the public, you do need to get a ticket. Details here.
A new acquaintance of mine who took my measure quickly and accurately sent me a book I'm delighted to have and will dive into as soon as I get the chance. It's "The Other Family Doctor: A Veterinarian Explores What Animals Can Teach Us About Love, Life and Mortality" by Karen Fine, who contributed this recent guest essay to Times Opinion.
On a Personal Note
I sometimes think I could write my own book on what dogs, specifically, do for us -- and I don't mean the herding, the hunting, the guarding. I mean what they do for us emotionally and spiritually. My relationship with Regan would give me much of the material I need, and that material would include how dogs turn our attention toward, and heighten our appreciation of, nature.
The centrality of an animal or animals in our lives reminds us of all the other animals out there, of how the world teems with remarkable and curious creatures, some of which our dogs and cats bark or hiss at, some of which they chase, a few of which they kill, at least if they're sufficiently bloodthirsty and skilled.
But dogs also connect us with nature because they invite and encourage us to venture with them into it. We spend more time outdoors and more time appreciating the outdoors, whether we're in cities, suburbs, exurbs or rural areas.
With Regan, I take forest walks of a length and adventurousness that I wouldn't otherwise, and when her nose twitches and her ears swivel at the smell or sound of something, I find my own curiosity piquing, my own senses sharpening. I hear the woodpecker that had escaped my notice just seconds before. I see the white tail of a deer almost obscured in tall grass. To follow Regan's gaze is to be introduced to the turtle moseying over the lip of the creek, to the fat wild turkey waddling up a distant slope. They were always there, but I wasn't around to note them, or I wasn't surveying the landscape with the requisite reverence.
But take the woods and the hikes out of the equation and Regan still reorients me toward the natural world. A walk with her around the block means breezes and bird song. In opening the door to let her out of and into the house, I notice a shimmering orange sun as it tugs itself above the horizon, a smudgy red one as it takes its final bow. I pause. I say a silent thanks. For the beauty of that. For the dog in the dimming light.

Big Profits Draw Scrutiny From Europe's Central Banks: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Companies' rising profit margins could be contributing to persistent inflation, a European Central Bank policymaker says.
After months of fretting about whether workers' rising pay would keep inflation uncomfortably high, central bankers in Europe have another concern: large company profits.
Companies that push up their prices above and beyond what is necessary to absorb higher costs could be fueling inflation that central bankers need to combat with higher interest rates, a policymaker at the European Central Bank warned, suggesting that governments might need to intervene in some situations.
Policymakers, long preoccupied with higher pay's tendency to prompt companies to raise their prices, generating a wage-price spiral, should also be alert to the risks of a so-called profit-price spiral, said Fabio Panetta, an executive board member at the E.C.B. At a conference in Frankfurt last week, he pointed out that in the fourth quarter of last year half of domestic price pressures in the eurozone came from profits, while the other half stemmed from wages.
His concerns have been echoed in recent remarks by the E.C.B.'s president, Christine Lagarde, and the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey. Although inflation in Europe has begun to ease from last year's double-digit peaks, the rates remain far above 2 percent, the target of most central banks.
"There's a lot of discussion on wage growth," Mr. Panetta said in an interview this week. "But we are probably paying insufficient attention to the other component of income -- that is, profits."
Profit margins at public companies in the eurozone -- measured by net income as a percentage of revenue -- averaged 8.5 percent in the year through March, according to Refinitiv, a step down from a recent peak of 8.7 percent in mid-February. Before the pandemic, at the end of 2019, the average margin was 7.2 percent.
There has been a similar phenomenon in the United States, where companies reported wide profit margins last year despite the highest inflation in four decades.
Companies could be increasing prices because of higher input costs (the expenses of producing their goods or services), or because they expect future cost increases, or because they have market power that allows them to raise prices without suffering a loss of demand, Mr. Panetta said. Some producers could be exploiting supply bottlenecks or taking advantage of this period of high inflation, which makes it more challenging for customers to be sure of the cause of price increases.
"Given the situation which prevails in the economy, there could be ideal conditions for firms to increase their prices and profits," he added.
"I'm not here to pass a judgment on how fair or unfair" price-setting is, Mr. Panetta insisted, but rather to explore all of the causes of inflation. He is a member of the E.C.B.'s six-person executive board that sets policy alongside the governors of the 20 central banks in the eurozone.
There are sectors where "input costs are falling while retail prices are increasing and profits are also increasing," Mr. Panetta said. "So this is enough to be worried as a central banker that there could be an increase in inflation due to increasing profits."
The average rate of inflation for the 20 countries that use the euro has been falling for five months -- to 6.9 percent over the year through March -- but core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, a measure used by policymakers to assess how deeply inflation is embedding in the economy, has continued to rise.
Central bankers tend to focus on the risk that jumps in pay will lead to persistently high inflation, especially in Europe where wages tend to change more slowly than in the United States. The E.C.B. is even developing new tools to measure changes in wages more quickly.
But this intense focus on wages has provoked some criticism. Mr. Bailey of the Bank of England was called out last year for suggesting workers should show restraint in asking for higher wages.
As inflation persists, attention has turned to corporate profits. There is uncertainty about what will happen as prices for energy and other commodities keep falling: Will companies restrain themselves from raising prices further?
Last week, Ms. Lagarde raised the issue of profits, saying there needed to be fair burden sharing between companies and workers to absorb the hit to the economy and income from higher energy prices.
In Britain, Mr. Bailey told companies to bear in mind when setting prices that inflation was expected to fall. Across the Atlantic, last year Lael Brainard, who was then the vice-chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, suggested that amid high profit margins in some industries, a reduction in markups could bring down inflation.
In Europe, companies were able to protect their profit margins last year from high inflation more than expected, Marcus Morris-Eyton, a European equities analyst at Allianz Global Investor, said.
"Corporates had more pricing power, at an average level, than most investors expected," he said.
This year, he expects there will be more variety in profit margins. "The average European company will face far greater margin pressure this year than they did last year," Mr. Morris-Eyton said. That's because of higher wage costs but "partly because as input costs have fallen, there is greater pressure from your customers to lower prices."
Last year, record-breaking profits by energy producers angered consumers who faced high energy bills, while governments spent billions to protect households from some of those costs. But as energy prices have fallen, consumers are still experiencing rising food prices. In the eurozone, the annual rate of food inflation rose to 15.4 percent in March.
"To a certain extent there's been also an opportunistic move by some big manufacturers to actually increase their prices, sometimes above their own cost increases," said Christel Delberghe, the director general of EuroCommerce, a Brussels-based organization representing wholesale and retail companies. "It's kind of a free-riding on a high price environment."
It's a factor squeezing retail profits, alongside the rising costs of products they buy and resell and higher cost of operations.
There is a notable disparity in profit margins between food producers and retailers, a traditionally low-margin business. Unilever and Nestlé each reported profit margins in the high teens for 2022, while the French supermarket company Carrefour reported a margin of about 3 percent. Unilever raised prices for its products more than 11 percent last year and Nestlé more than 8 percent, but in both cases the companies said they had not passed on all the effects of higher costs to consumers.
Ms. Delberghe said she feared the blame for higher prices was unfairly going to land on retailers. "We're extremely worried because indeed there is this perception that prices are going up and that it's very unfair," she said. Retail businesses are getting a lot of pushback, including from governments trying to take action to stop price increases in stores.
Mr. Panetta said governments should step in where necessary, in part because their fiscal support programs have helped keep profits high. "If there is a sector in particular where market power is abused or there is insufficient competition, then there should be competition policies that should intervene," he said.
But it was also a message to companies.
"It should be clear to producers that strategies based on high prices that increase profits and inflation may turn out to be costly for them," he said.
The cost? Higher interest rates.

Here to Help; A Recipe for Pan-Seared Pork Chops With Charred Pineapple: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In this quick skillet dinner, which is reminiscent of sweet and sour pork and tacos al pastor, boneless pork chops are seared with just a bit of sugar to promote browning, then pineapple chunks cook in the drippings until caramelized but still crisp. Once the pork is cooked, a spicy soy sauce is poured on top to add juiciness. It's a perfect combination: The tangy, sweet pineapple cuts the richness of the pork, while the soy sauce balances the sweetness of the pineapple. You could also use tofu, boneless chicken thighs, thinly sliced pork tenderloin or shoulder, or a firm fish in place of the pork chops. Eat with rice, noodles, sliced cucumbers or sautéed greens.
Time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings ¼ cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 hot green or red chile, thinly sliced, or ½ teaspoon ground cayenne
Granulated sugar
6 thin (½-inch) boneless pork chops (about 1½ pounds total), patted dry
Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
2 tablespoons neutral oil (such as grapeseed)
3 cups of 1½-inch pineapple pieces (from half of a pineapple)
Handful of cilantro leaves and stems, coarsely chopped, for garnish 1. In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, chile and a pinch of sugar; set aside. Season the pork chops all over with salt and 1 teaspoon sugar. 2. Heat the neutral oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add the pork and cook until browned underneath, 3 to 4 minutes. Press the meat with your tongs or spatula so it doesn't buckle. Flip and cook until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat, transfer the pork to a lipped plate or platter and pour over the soy sauce dressing. 3. Set the skillet over medium and cook the pineapple, undisturbed, until golden and charred underneath but not soft or cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Nestle the pineapple in the dressing among the pork chops. Eat right away or let sit for up to 15 minutes. Serve the pork and pineapple with a spoonful of the dressing and the cilantro on top.

Ritzy Cheddar Chicken Breasts
They’re as good as they sound: cheesy chicken cutlets coated with buttery Ritz crackers. Skipping the usual flour-egg-bread crumb dredge, this recipe relies instead on a flavorful base layer of tangy sour cream, which has lactic acid that tenderizes boneless, skinless chicken breasts beautifully. When it comes to breaded white meat, thin cutlets are ideal, which you can buy from the store or achieve by slicing thick breasts in half horizontally (no pounding necessary). They cook more evenly this way, staying tender throughout as they’re quickly baked in a hot oven. Serve with something fresh — a big green salad, perhaps — to balance the wonderful richness of this nostalgic number.
By Eric Kim
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 30 minutes
Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for greasing wire rack
1/4 cup sour cream
1 large egg white
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds total)
1 sleeve Ritz crackers (about 100 grams)
2 ounces extra-sharp Cheddar cheese, coarsely grated (about 1 cup)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
Preparation:
1. Position rack in the bottom third of the oven and heat oven to 450 degrees. Place an ovenproof wire rack over a sheet pan. Dab a folded-up paper towel with olive oil and rub it over the wire rack to grease it.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sour cream, egg white and Dijon mustard until smooth. Season with salt. Lay the chicken flat on a cutting board and carve each breast in half horizontally so you end up with four thin cutlets. Add the chicken to the sour cream mixture, and using your hands, smear the sour cream all over the chicken.
3. In a large bowl, crush the Ritz crackers into coarse pieces with your fingers. Some crackers will turn to rubble while others turn to dust. Add the cheese, garlic powder, onion powder and olive oil. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and toss until evenly distributed. Holding one of the chicken cutlets by its thinner end, add to the bowl with the crumbs, and using your hands, pack the crumbs onto the chicken, pressing them in to create a thick coating. Transfer the breaded chicken to the rack in the sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining three cutlets.
4. Bake the cutlets until the outsides are crispy and the insides are no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Let the chicken cool slightly so the coating can set, about 5 minutes, before transferring to plates and serving.
One-Pan Salmon Niçoise With Orzo
This one-skillet dinner has the bright flavors of a salade Niçoise but is more substantial, so you can eat it all year long, even on a chilly evening. For a happy mix of exciting textures — tender salmon and orzo, snappy green beans, juicy tomatoes — cook the orzo with shallots and olives, then in the last few minutes of cooking, nestle in the green beans and salmon fillets to cook. Meanwhile, stir together a vinaigrette that’s punchy with fresh tomatoes, vinegar, Dijon mustard and raw shallot to spoon over the finished dish. Adapt this rendition further as you like, adding anchovies with the sautéed or raw shallots, swapping the salmon for canned tuna, or adding capers or sliced cucumbers to the tomato vinaigrette.
By Ali Slagle
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 35 minutes
Ingredients:
1 large shallot, coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup orzo
Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and pepper
1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives
1 pint cherry or other small tomatoes, halved (8 to 10 ounces)
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
Handful of basil leaves or pinch of thyme leaves (optional)
4 (4- to 5-ounce) salmon fillets, skin on or off
8 ounces green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths
Preparation:
1. Transfer 1 tablespoon of the chopped shallot to a medium bowl, then add the remaining shallot to a large (12-inch) skillet. Add 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet and heat over medium high. When the oil is sizzling, add the orzo, season with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper, and stir constantly until light golden, 2 to 4 minutes.
2. Add the olives plus 2 1/4 cups water; bring to a boil, then cover the skillet with a lid, baking sheet or foil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook according to package directions until the orzo is al dente.
3. Meanwhile, add the tomatoes, red wine vinegar, mustard, herbs (if using) and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the reserved shallots in the bowl; season to taste with salt and pepper then set aside. Season the salmon with salt and pepper.
4. When the orzo is al dente, add the green beans and stir to combine. If orzo looks dry, add 1/4 cup water; you want it to be wet but not soupy. Nestle the salmon in a single layer into the orzo, skin-side up if applicable. Cover and cook until the salmon and orzo are cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit, covered, for 2 minutes. If your salmon has skin, peel it off and discard. Top the orzo and salmon with the tomatoes and vinaigrette.
Glazed Tofu With Chile and Star Anise
This sauce — a dark, star anise-spiced caramel intermingled with rice wine, soy sauce, ginger and scallions — builds sweet, acidic and umami notes as it coats and infuses tofu. Sichuan hui guo rou, or twice-cooked pork, inspired the technique used here with tofu: The blocks are first seared whole, then torn into bite-size pieces and returned to the pan, where the craggy edges absorb the sauce. Additions from your pantry, such as a spoonful of doubanjiang, or fermented broad bean paste, fermented black beans or chile oil can invite deeper, more complex flavors. Serve warm with steamed rice and stir-fried greens.
By Yewande Komolafe
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 30 minutes
Ingredients:
2 (14-ounce) packages firm tofu, drained
2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed
Kosher salt
1/4 cup sugar
1 whole star anise
1 cup vegetable broth or stock
1/4 cup Shaoxing wine
1/4 cup dark soy sauce (see tip)
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 (1/2-inch) piece fresh ginger, scrubbed and thinly sliced
1 small hot dried chile
6 scallions, whites cut into 1/2-inch pieces, greens thinly sliced
Steamed rice, for serving
Preparation:
1. Place the tofu blocks between paper towels and press gently to remove excess liquid.
2. In a large skillet or cast-iron pan, warm the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Season both sides of the tofu with salt and place in the pan; sear without moving until the contact side is browned, about 4 minutes. Turn the pieces over and sear the other side until browned, about 3 minutes. Transfer the tofu to a plate.
3. Carefully add 1/2 cup water, the sugar and star anise to the pan. (The mixture will sputter and steam.) Cook, stirring, until the syrup is reduced and turns deep amber, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour in the stock carefully (again being mindful of sputtering), along with the Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, garlic, ginger and chile, and cook, stirring frequently, until reduced, syrupy and glossy, 5 to 7 minutes.
4. Use your fingers to break the tofu into 1/2-inch pieces, return to the pan and add the scallion whites. Toss to coat with the sauce and cook until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and discard the star anise and dried chile. Garnish with scallion greens and serve immediately with steamed rice.
TIP: To replicate 1/4 cup dark soy sauce using regular or light soy sauce, combine 1/4 cup regular or light soy sauce with 2 teaspoons molasses.
Linguine With Clam Sauce
Purists may object, but canned clams are a great weeknight pantry stalwart. When fresh ones are out of reach, or when you’ve decided you need a briny fix, the canned clam is reliable no matter the season. This recipe calls for dry vermouth, which adds a subtle herbaceous layer of flavor. (Vermouth has a long shelf life when stored properly, and it’s great to have on hand to make a last-minute pan sauce.) Canned clams are already salty, so be mindful of oversalting the pasta water or the sauce. The dish is finished with lemon zest for brightness and butter for silkiness. The best part? The whole thing can be on the table in the same amount of time it takes to boil water.
By Colu Henry
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
Total time: 25 minutes
Ingredients:
Kosher salt
1 pound linguine or other long pasta, such as linguine fini or spaghetti
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving (optional)
5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1/2 to 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 cup dry vermouth or dry white wine
2 (10-ounce) cans whole baby clams with their juices
Black pepper
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 teaspoons lemon zest (from 1 to 2 lemons)
1/2 cup chopped Italian parsley
Lemon wedges, for serving (optional)
Preparation:
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until 2 minutes short of al dente (it will finish cooking in the sauce). Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water, then drain pasta.
2. While the pasta cooks, make your sauce: Heat the oil in a deep-sided 12-inch skillet over medium. Add the garlic, red-pepper flakes and oregano and cook until the garlic is pale golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the vermouth and simmer until reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the clams with their juices and cook until just warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes more. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed.
3. Add the cooked pasta directly to the skillet along with the butter and lemon zest and toss until the butter has melted and the pasta is glossy with sauce. If needed, add 1/4 cup reserved pasta water. Stir in half the parsley.
4. Serve pasta topped with a drizzle of olive oil, if desired, and the remaining parsley. Serve lemon wedges alongside if you like. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

For World Bank Pick, Climate Is Key: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Ajay Banga will begin a monthlong "global listening tour" to drum up support for his nomination to be the bank's next president.
The Biden administration's nominee to be the next president of the World Bank, the international development and climate institution, is embarking on a monthlong sprint around the globe to solidify support for his candidacy.
It will be the first opportunity for the nominee, Ajay Banga, to share his vision for the bank, which has been aiming to take on a more ambitious role in combating climate change while maintaining its core commitment to alleviating poverty.
Mr. Banga, who has had a long career in finance, faces the challenge of convincing nations that his decades of private-sector experience will help him transform the World Bank.
He will begin his "global listening tour" on Monday with stops in Ivory Coast and Kenya, the Treasury Department said on Friday. In Ivory Coast, he will meet with senior government officials, leaders of the African Development Bank and civil society organizations. In Kenya, he will visit the Kenya Climate Innovation Center and a World Bank-backed project that helps local entrepreneurs find ways to address climate change.
Mr. Banga will focus on how finding development solutions can be intertwined with climate goals and emphasize his experience working on financial inclusion in Africa, where he helped expand access to electronic payments systems while chief executive of Mastercard, a Treasury official said.
The whirlwind campaign will also take Mr. Banga to Asia, Latin America and Europe.
The White House nominated him last week after the unexpected announcement last month that David Malpass will step down as World Bank president by the end of June, nearly a year before the end of his five-year term. Mr. Malpass, who was nominated by President Donald J. Trump, ignited a controversy last year when he appeared to express skepticism about whether fossil fuels contribute to global warming.
During a briefing at the Treasury Department this week, Mr. Banga made clear that he had no doubts about the causes of climate change. "Yes, there is scientific evidence, and it matters," he said.
Careful to strike a balance between the bank's growing climate ambitions and its poverty-reduction goals, Mr. Banga emphasized that both issues were interconnected and equally important.
"My belief is that poverty alleviation, or shared prosperity, or all those words that essentially imply the idea of tackling inequality, cannot be divorced from the challenges of managing nature in a constructive way," Mr. Banga added.
The World Bank's nomination process runs through March 29, and other countries may offer candidates. But by tradition, the United States, the bank's largest shareholder, selects an American to be its president. The executive board hopes to choose a new president by early May.
If approved by the board, Mr. Banga will face an array of challenges. The world economy is slowly emerging from three years of pandemic and war that have slowed global growth and worsened poverty. Emerging economies face the prospect of a cascade of defaults in the coming years, and the World Bank has been vocal in calling for debt reduction.
The Biden administration has pointed to China, one of the world's largest creditors, as a primary obstacle in debt-restructuring efforts. Mr. Banga was careful not to be critical of China and said he expected to travel there in the coming weeks.
"Today I'm the nominee of the United States, but if I'm lucky enough to be elected, then I represent all the countries who are part of the bank," Mr. Banga said on Thursday. "Having their points of view known, understood and openly discussed -- maybe not agreed to, but openly discussed -- is an important part of leading a multilateral institution."
His nomination has won both praise and skepticism from climate activists and development experts.
Some climate groups have lamented Mr. Banga's lack of direct public-sector experience and expressed concern about his affiliation with companies that invest in the oil and gas industries.
"Many question whether his history at global multinationals such as Citibank, Nestlé, KFC and Mastercard will prepare him for the huge challenges of poverty and inequality," Recourse, a nonprofit environmental organization, said in a statement this week. Recourse has been critical of the World Bank's policies on gas transition, its exposure to coal and its pace of action on climate change.
Other prominent activists have praised Mr. Banga, including Vice President Al Gore, who predicted that he would bring "renewed leadership on the climate crisis to the World Bank."
And others viewed Mr. Banga as a natural choice to bridge the gap between the bank's broad mandates.
"Throughout discussions of the World Bank's evolution, borrowing countries have consistently communicated that financing for climate should not come at the expense of other development priorities," Stephanie Segal, a senior fellow with the Economics Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in an essay this week. "In nominating Banga, whose candidacy does not lead with climate, the United States has signaled agreement that the bank's development mandate cannot be abandoned in favor of a 'climate only' agenda."
The Biden administration has also faced questions about why it did not choose a woman to lead the bank, which has had only men serve as its full-time president.
Mr. Banga asserted that as someone who was born and educated in India, he would bring diversity and a unique perspective to the World Bank. He also emphasized that at Mastercard, he had demonstrated a commitment to empowering women and elevating them to senior roles.
"I think that you should credit the administration with taking a huge leap forward into finding somebody who wasn't born here, wasn't educated here," Mr. Banga said. "I believe that giving people a level playing field is our job."
He added: "And that means whether you're a woman, your color, your sexual orientation, growing up on the wrong side of the tracks, it doesn't matter."

Ex-Mastercard Chief, Born in India, Nominated to World Bank: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: President Biden tapped the former Mastercard chief executive to run an organization that found itself mired in controversy after comments by the current president about climate change.
BENGALURU, India -- The Biden administration nominated Ajay Banga, the former longtime chief executive of Mastercard, to be the next president of the World Bank, a selection that is likely to drastically reshape the global development institution and broaden its ambitions to combat climate change.
The nomination will initiate a monthslong confirmation process before a final decision by the World Bank's board. It is not clear if any other countries will nominate a candidate. The World Bank president is traditionally an American citizen chosen by the United States.
If confirmed, Mr. Banga will bring vast experience running large organizations and deep knowledge of the digital economy. Raised in India, he would bring a firsthand understanding of the challenges that developing countries face.
"Ajay is uniquely equipped to lead the World Bank at this critical moment in history," President Biden said in a statement. "He has spent more than three decades building and managing successful, global companies that create jobs and bring investment to developing economies, and guiding organizations through periods of fundamental change."
Speculation surrounding the nomination gathered momentum in the week since David Malpass, the current World Bank president, announced his intention to step down by the end of June, with nearly a year left in his five-year term. Mr. Malpass, who was picked by President Donald J. Trump, drew criticism from climate activists and stirred frustration among Biden administration officials for his lack of focus on the bank's climate agenda.
Those concerns came to a head in September, when Mr. Malpass came under fire for his views on climate change. When asked if he accepted the overwhelming scientific consensus that the burning of fossil fuels was causing global temperatures to rise, he demurred. "I'm not a scientist," he said. The exchange, during a live interview at a New York Times event, set off a slow-motion public relations crisis for Mr. Malpass.
Mr. Banga has sought to carve out a public stance signaling his concern for climate change, including at Mastercard. In 2020, under his watch, the company announced the creation of the Priceless Planet Coalition, a group of about 100 firms that make corporate investments to preserve the environment.
"No matter who you are or what you do, climate change affects you. But, it has the biggest negative impact on those who are socially and economically vulnerable," Mr. Banga said at the time.
Former Vice President Al Gore, who won a Nobel Prize for his work to fight global warming, praised the nomination. "Those who have worked with Ajay Banga know that he is an exemplary leader, and I am extremely optimistic that he will bring renewed leadership on the climate crisis to the World Bank," Mr. Gore said.
Still, his selection prompted dismay from some climate activists who have been calling on the Biden administration to nominate a president with a strong background in environmental issues. His lack of direct public-sector experience could also be viewed with skepticism by some development experts.
"Put simply, this is not the guy that President Biden should be nominating when a livable planet is teetering at the brink of collapse," John Noël, senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace USA, said in a statement. "If Mr. Banga is to lead the World Bank, we hope he will follow the demands of science and justice by lending significantly more money to climate projects and ending funding for oil and gas projects."
Others said the choice was indicative of the changing role of the World Bank. A central part of the next president's job will be re-engineering the institution to make it a more pivotal player in a coordinated effort by Western nations to address global warming, despite some developing countries' concerns that the mission could overtake the bank's poverty reduction goals.
"I think it's interesting that they're not tapping a climate expert per se, they are tapping someone who can help them with climate finance," said Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. "It sends a pretty clear signal that the U.S. wants to look at the bank as a bank."
Mr. Banga has described the challenge of climate change, which he called "humanity versus nature," as a matter of trade-offs that has for years stumped politicians.
"You end up applying what are shorter-term solutions to what are very long-term problems," Mr. Banga said in 2021 in a conversation at the Council on Foreign Relations. "And therefore you end up putting a band aid on an open wound."
Mr. Banga has become a close ally of Vice President Kamala Harris and is part of a group of 10 corporate executives who have worked with her office to raise $ 1 billion aimed at stemming the root causes of immigration from Central America. Ms. Harris has cited poverty, corruption, climate change and political instability as the factors fueling migration.
The collaboration has so far raised about $ 4 billion to support communities in the region. In an interview with The Times last fall, Mr. Banga said he approached the effort with the understanding that it would not result in any short-term wins.
"Investing in a region takes patience, time and resilience," Mr. Banga said.
Mr. Banga is currently a vice chairman of General Atlantic, a private equity firm. He retired from Mastercard in 2021 after running the company for more than a decade, quadrupling its profits and becoming one of the most prominent Indian American executives in the United States. Before Mastercard, Mr. Banga worked for more than a decade at Citigroup and at Nestlé in India.
The son of an army general, Mr. Banga has said his upbringing, which involved moving around different cities in India, made him highly adaptable.
"The one thing it did for me more than anything else was this easy adaptability, the willingness to adjust and the willingness to just fit in; I think it's helped me in all my life," Mr. Banga told The Times in 2020.
Mr. Banga has said his experience of being an immigrant to the United States inspired his ambition to bring 500 million people around the world who are "unbanked" into the financial system. Although he had a good income when he moved to the United States in 2000, the fact that he was not yet a citizen with a credit history made it a challenge to even buy a cellphone.
"I call myself financially excluded at that time," Mr. Banga said at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in 2020. "Financial exclusion is not just people who don't have an income."
Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School of international affairs at Tufts University and a former World Bank vice president and climate change envoy, said that while Mr. Banga did not have a deep history of working on climate and fiscal policy, he had strong management skills and a genuine concern about climate change.
"He's a proven C.E.O., he turned Mastercard around and built it into the modern organization that it is, he has a deep commitment to financial inequality and he's in the last few years become very conversant in the climate crisis," Ms. Kyte said in an interview. "Is he a climate activist? No. Has he been working in development for 40 years? No. But does he understand the macro-level investment that needs to happen to make the money flow to green energy instead of brown? Yes. "
The World Bank's board of executive directors met this week to open up the nomination process and lay out the criteria for in its next leader. Those qualities included a proven track record of leadership and accomplishment, particularly in development, and experience managing large international organizations while being familiar with the public sector.
The board of executive directors said it "would strongly encourage women candidates to be nominated."
The bank has never had a woman serve as its permanent president, although Kristalina Georgieva, who is the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, served as acting president in 2019.
Countries have until March 29 to put forward other nominees. The World Bank's board hopes to select a new president by May.
Biden administration officials said they did not know if any other country would offer a nominee and explained that they were able to nominate Mr. Banga so quickly because they had been preparing for the end of Mr. Malpass's term next April. Asked about why the White House did not select a woman, as the executive board suggested, the officials pointed to Mr. Banga's dynamic background and noted that he had a strong track record of promoting gender equality and inclusion within organizations.
"His management record on women will be important for the board to consider since NGOs and others will focus on the missed opportunity to nominate a woman," said Paul M. Cadario, a former senior manager at the World Bank who is now a distinguished fellow at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy.

Banga has said that his experience of being an immigrant to the United States inspired his ambition to bring 500 million people around the world who are “unbanked” into the financial system. Although he had a good income when he moved to the United States in 2000, the fact that he was not yet a citizen with a credit history made it a challenge to even buy a cellphone.
“I call myself financially excluded at that time,” Banga said at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in 2020. “Financial exclusion is not just people who don’t have an income.”
Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School of international affairs at Tufts University and a former World Bank vice president and climate change envoy, said that while Banga does not have a deep history of working on climate and fiscal policy, he has strong management skills and a genuine concern about climate change.
“He’s a proven CEO, he turned Mastercard around and built it into the modern organization that it is, he has a deep commitment to financial inequality and he’s in the last few years become very conversant in the climate crisis,” Kyte said in an interview. “Is he a climate activist? No. Has he been working in development for 40 years? No. But does he understand the macro-level investment that needs to happen to make the money flow to green energy instead of brown? Yes.”
The World Bank’s board of executive directors met this week to open up the nomination process and lay out the criteria for in its next leader. Those qualities included a proven track record of leadership and accomplishment, particularly in development, and experience managing large international organizations while being familiar with the public sector.
The board of executive directors said that it “would strongly encourage women candidates to be nominated.”
The bank has never had a woman serve as its permanent president, although Kristalina Georgieva, who is the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, served as acting president in 2019.
Countries have until March 29 to put forward other nominees. The World Bank’s board hopes to select a new president by May.
Biden administration officials said that they did not know if any other country would offer a nominee and explained that they were able to nominate Banga so quickly because they had been preparing for the end of Malpass’ term next April. Asked about why the White House did not select a woman, as the executive board suggested, the officials pointed to Banga’s dynamic background and noted that he has a strong track record of promoting gender equality and inclusion within organizations.
“His management record on women will be important for the board to consider since NGOs and others will focus on the missed opportunity to nominate a woman,” said Paul M. Cadario, a former senior manager at the World Bank who is now a distinguished fellow at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy.

I had the good fortune to eat eggplant Parmesan for dinner this week (not made by me!), and it got me thinking about the intense pleasures of the Parm family — not just eggplant Parmesan, but the various iterations made with chicken, pork, veal, mushrooms, cauliflower or even zucchini. (There’s also air-fryer chicken Parmesan, which amplifies the crispness of that breaded crust.) That bubbling combination of meat or vegetables coated in toasted breadcrumbs, rich tomato sauce and creamy cheese is one for the ages.
Most of those dishes can’t be made quickly after work. They take some time. This is why Kay Chun’s recipe for eggplant Parmesan pasta shines like a beacon. A version of homemade Parm? On a Monday? Yes.
1. Eggplant Parmesan Pasta
The unassuming eggplant is the star of this comforting weeknight pasta that manages to capture the flavors of traditional eggplant Parmigiana without the fuss of frying, layering and baking. Cubed eggplant is browned with onion and garlic until golden, then simmered in a quick pantry-friendly tomato sauce until meltingly tender. Mezze rigatoni, fusilli and shells all do great jobs of capturing the thick sauce. The pasta is finished with slivers of fresh mozzarella that soften and offer cool, creamy bites, and a final sprinkling of a Parmesan breadcrumb topping offers familiar moments of crunch to contrast the creamy sauce.
By Kay Chun
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 35 minutes
Ingredients:
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3/4 cup panko breadcrumbs
Kosher salt and black pepper
1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion (from 1 small onion)
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 pounds eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes (8 cups)
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes, crushed with your hands in a bowl
1 basil sprig, plus 1/3 cup coarsely chopped basil leaves
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1 pound short pasta, such as mezze rigatoni, fusilli or shells
2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
8 ounces fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced and at room temperature
Preparation:
1. In a high-sided large (12-inch) skillet with a lid, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium. Add panko, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring constantly, until golden and crispy, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Set a large pot of salted water to boil.
2. Wipe out the skillet and heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in garlic until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add eggplant and drizzle over the remaining ¼ cup oil. Season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until eggplant is softened, about 8 minutes. Add in tomato paste and stir constantly until lightly caramelized on the bottom of the skillet, about 2 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, basil sprig, oregano and 1 1/2 cups of water, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.
3. Cover the skillet and reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally and smashing some of the eggplant, until the eggplant is very tender and the sauce is thickened, about 15 minutes. Discard the basil sprig.
4. Meanwhile, in the large pot of water, cook pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water and drain.
5. Add cooked pasta, reserved pasta water and the eggplant sauce to the large pasta cooking pot, and cook over medium heat, stirring, until sauce thickens and coats the pasta, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup of the chopped basil.
6. Add Parmesan to the panko and mix well. Divide the pasta in bowls and top each with some of the mozzarella. Sprinkle over cheesy breadcrumbs, and garnish with the remaining basil.
2. Quinoa and Broccoli Spoon Salad
This easy chopped salad fits loads of texture and flavor onto a spoon by combining finely chopped raw broccoli with chewy dried cranberries, crunchy pecans, fluffy quinoa and chunks of sharp Cheddar cheese. The mixture is tossed in a punchy mustard vinaigrette that soaks into the florets, only getting better as it sits. Feel free to substitute the quinoa for any grain, like brown rice, farro or buckwheat groats, though the cook time may vary.
By Sohla El-Waylly
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
Total time: 30 minutes
Ingredients:
Kosher salt
1 cup quinoa, rinsed
1 lemon
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
Freshly ground black pepper
1 large bunch broccoli (about 1 1/2 pounds)
1 medium tart and crisp apple
4 ounces sharp Cheddar
3/4 cup toasted pecans, roughly chopped
1/2 cup dried cranberries
Preparation:
1. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil on high and season aggressively with salt. Add the quinoa, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer; cook until plump and tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a fine-mesh sieve; rinse with cool water and drain well.
2. While the quinoa cooks, finely grate the zest of the lemon into a large bowl then cut the lemon in half. Add the olive oil, mustard, honey and apple cider vinegar, plus the juice of 1/2 lemon; whisk together. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
3. Peel the stem of the broccoli and trim off the dry end. Finely chop the entire broccoli and add to the dressing. Core the apple then finely chop the apple and the cheese; add to the broccoli and toss to combine.
4. Add the cooked quinoa, nuts and cranberries and toss to combine. Taste and add more salt, pepper and lemon juice, as needed. Store, refrigerated, for up to 3 days.
3. Chicken Breasts With Lemon
In this recipe, which Pierre Franey brought to The New York Times in 1992 in one of his 60-Minute Gourmet columns, two teaspoons of lemon zest are added to a simple sauce of lemon juice, thyme, garlic and shallots. It is, at once, lively and elegant. To round it out, it needs a sturdy accompaniment. Franey suggested mashed potatoes with garlic and basil, with just a little olive oil swirled in.
By Pierre Franey
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 25 minutes
Ingredients:
1/2 cup flour for dredging
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
4 skinless boneless chicken breasts, about 6 ounces each
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried
2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots
2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic
2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 cup chicken broth, fresh or canned
2 tablespoons butter
Preparation:
1. Season flour with salt and pepper, and dredge the chicken all over. Remove the excess flour.
2. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet large enough to hold the chicken pieces in one layer. Add chicken and cook, uncovered, over medium heat for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.
3. Flip the chicken and cook for 5 minutes more, or until cooked through. Carefully remove the oil from the skillet, leaving the chicken. Discard the oil.
4. Add the thyme, shallots and garlic, and cook for about a minute. Do not burn the garlic. Add the lemon rind, the lemon juice and the broth.
5. Scrape the skillet to dissolve the brown particles that cling to the bottom. Add the butter, and cook for 3 minutes longer. Serve immediately.
4. Sheet-Pan Tofu and Brussels Sprouts With Hoisin-Tahini Sauce
Two powerhouse pantry ingredients — hoisin sauce and tahini — come together to turn this vegetarian sheet-pan dinner into a memorable meal. Hoisin, which is made with fermented soybeans, is often used as a sweet and savory glaze for meat, but it also injects big, deep flavors into vegetable-based dishes. Here, it is mixed with tahini to create a tangy, creamy sauce that is reminiscent of one served with fried rice noodle rolls at dim sum. This dish could be served with rice or noodles, or you could add a few spinach leaves for a salad-leaning meal, but the crispy, earthy Brussels sprouts and toothsome golden tofu are more than hearty enough on their own.
By Hetty McKinnon
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 40 minutes
Ingredients:
For the Brussels Sprouts and Tofu:
2 pounds Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
Extra virgin olive oil
Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
2 (14-ounce) packages extra-firm tofu, drained and cut into 1/4-inch thick slices
For the Sauce:
3 tablespoons hoisin sauce
3 tablespoons tahini
1 garlic clove, grated
Preparation:
1. Heat oven to 450 degrees, and arrange the racks in the bottom and middle positions.
2. You will need two rimmed sheet pans. Place the Brussels sprouts on one sheet pan and drizzle with about 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Season with 1 teaspoon of salt and a few turns of black pepper. Toss to ensure the sprouts are well coated.
3. On the second sheet pan, drizzle with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil and tilt the pan so the oil coats the surface. Place the tofu slices onto the pan and season well with about 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and several turns of black pepper. Drizzle the tops of the tofu with more olive oil.
4. Place the two sheet pans into the oven, on the middle and bottom racks, and roast for 25 to 30 minutes, switching the pans halfway through. When ready, the Brussels sprouts will be tender and crispy in spots and the tofu will be lightly golden.
5. Meanwhile, place the hoisin, tahini, garlic and 3 tablespoons of water in a small bowl and whisk until combined. The sauce should be thick, but with a pourable consistency. (If it looks too thick, you can add a touch more water.)
6. Serve the Brussels sprouts alongside the tofu and drizzle over the hoisin-tahini sauce. Eat warm or at room temperature.
5. Pan-Seared Pork Chops With Charred Pineapple
In this quick skillet dinner, which is reminiscent of sweet and sour pork and tacos al pastor, boneless pork chops are seared with just a bit of sugar to promote browning, then pineapple chunks cook in the drippings until caramelized but still crisp. Once the pork is cooked, a spicy soy sauce is poured on top to add juiciness. It’s a perfect combination: The tangy, sweet pineapple cuts the richness of the pork, while the soy sauce balances the sweetness of the pineapple. You could also use tofu, boneless chicken thighs, thinly sliced pork tenderloin or shoulder, or a firm fish in place of the pork chops. Eat with rice, noodles, sliced cucumbers or sautéed greens.
By Ali Slagle
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 20 minutes
Ingredients:
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 hot green or red chile, thinly sliced, or 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne
Sugar
6 thin (1/2-inch) boneless pork chops (about 1 1/2 pounds total), patted dry
Salt
2 tablespoons neutral oil (such as grapeseed)
3 cups of 1 1/2-inch pineapple pieces (from 1/2 a pineapple)
Handful of cilantro leaves and stems, coarsely chopped, for garnish
Preparation:
1. In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, chile and a pinch of sugar; set aside. Season the pork chops all over with salt and 1 teaspoon sugar.
2. Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add the pork and cook until browned underneath, 3 to 4 minutes. Press the meat with your tongs or spatula so it doesn’t buckle. Flip and cook until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat, transfer the pork to a lipped plate or platter and pour over the soy sauce dressing.
3. Set the skillet over medium and cook the pineapple, undisturbed, until golden and charred underneath but not soft or cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Nestle the pineapple in the dressing among the pork chops. Eat right away or let sit for up to 15 minutes. Serve the pork and pineapple with a spoonful of the dressing and the cilantro on top.

Cloud Technology Firm Announces More Layoffs
Cloud communications company Twilio said on Monday it was eliminating about 17 percent of positions and closing some offices as part of a restructuring effort to focus on profitability.
Technology firms have laid off thousands of workers recently as they brace for a period of lower demand, high interest rates and macro economic instability.
The move, which is the second instance of job cuts in five months, sent the company's share up 2 percent. The stock fell 81 percent last year but has gained a quarter of its value this year.
Twilio had just under 9,000 employees as of September. Twilio will reorganize the company into two units, Twilio Communications and Twilio Data and Applications.
"This is because the two parts of our business -- communications and software -- are at different life-cycle stages and have different operating needs," Jeff Lawson, the chief executive officer and co-founder, said in a blog post. REUTERS

In Venezuela, Credit Cards Now Said to Be Useless
Credit cards are becoming increasingly useless in Venezuela because of high inflation and government restrictions, hurting people already struggling to meet daily needs on low salaries, banking industry sources, analysts and consumers said.
The country's government imposed strict lending requirements during Venezuela's economic collapse -- allowing banks to lend a maximum of 27 percent of their cash flow -- sending local business owners abroad to seek loans.
And though the government of President Nicolas Maduro loosened currency controls in 2019 and let local banks open dollar-denominated accounts, many credit restrictions remain.
"They are useless," administrator Lina Pereira, from the central city of Valencia, said of her two credit cards, which both have low limits. "My parents bought appliances and computers with their credit cards, but that's a memory for Venezuelans." REUTERS

Companies' Climate Plans Do Not Bear Scrutiny
Climate commitments by companies aren't always as green as they seem. A new report concludes major brands are exaggerating how ambitious their efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions are -- in effect misleading consumers, investors and governments.
The report published Monday by the Europe-based environmental think tanks NewClimate Institute and Carbon Market Watch examined 24 companies, including KitKat manufacturer Nestlé, French retailer Carrefour and automaker Volkswagen. It found that only one company -- shipping firm Maersk -- had climate plans with "reasonable integrity" while the rest were assessed to be moderate to very low.
"For the majority of companies, we found their climate strategies to be lacking," said Thomas Day, a researcher at the NewClimate Institute who co-authored the report. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Companies Pledge Aid To Reduce Migration: [National Desk]

Full text: The vice president said private companies had pledged almost $ 1 billion to support communities in Central America.
WASHINGTON -- Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday announced almost $ 1 billion in new pledges by private companies to support communities in Central America, part of the Biden administration's effort to keep migrants from fleeing toward the U.S. border.
Ten companies, including Nestle, Target and Columbia Sportswear, said they would collectively spend $ 950 million on projects in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to support farmers, create textile jobs and invest in telecommunications and other industries.
The effort comes as crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border remain at record highs, posing logistical and humanitarian challenges to President Biden and drawing intense criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill.
House Republicans have begun to investigate the administration's efforts at the border and said they might pursue the impeachment of Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary.
The vice president's announcement came on Monday afternoon as she met with a number of companies.
It added to the commitments from businesses through the Partnership for Central America, a nonprofit organization that was created in mid-2021 to facilitate Ms. Harris's efforts to rally support for the region. The partnership had previously announced about $ 3 billion in future spending from a range of companies.
The idea, according to the vice president's aides, is to address what she calls the root causes of migration: poverty, corruption, climate change and political instability that drives people to leave their homes in search of a better life.
Administration officials said the program had already generated results, though they acknowledged on a call with reporters that they could not specifically document that effects. Since mid-2021, officials said, migration from the three countries was down 71 percent.
"As part of this public-private partnership, approximately 47 companies and organizations are collaborating across financial services, textiles and apparel, agriculture, technology, telecommunications and nonprofit sectors to strengthen the region's economic security," the White House wrote in a fact sheet released on Monday.
But even those participating in the effort say there are challenges to its success, especially in the short term.
Ajay Banga, the former executive chairman of Mastercard and one of the business executives who worked with Ms. Harris on the effort to raise money for Central America, said it was unlikely to make a difference in the next few months or even years.
"If anyone speaking to you is declaring victory, they're crazy," Mr. Banga said in November. "There's work. There's real work there. That $ 3 billion is interesting, but it is not implemented yet."
Mr. Banga and others said they had been impressed with Ms. Harris's preparation and well-informed questions behind the scenes on the issue. But he said that the administration's focus on oversight when investing the funds and deterring illegal migration was critical to its success.
"Then this can make a difference over five or 10 years," Mr. Banga said.
There are other challenges, too. People who have worked with the administration for the past year and a half said that private investment was not enough as the United States competes with other countries, especially China, for investment in the region.
Executives with some of the companies who pledged to spend millions of dollars over the course of the next five years or so said they would also need regulatory changes and adjustments to tariffs if they wanted to be successful in the long run.
They will also need infrastructure to support their investments -- roads, internet and power -- and a total scale of spending by other similar companies. Both are things that China has embraced as it spreads investments through Asia, Africa and Latin America.
In response, the administration said on Monday that Ms. Harris would announce a program aimed at increasing investment in infrastructure in the region.
The program aims to help companies gain access to funding from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and will create a Northern Central America Investment Facilitation Team intended to promote economic development.

Banga and others said they had been impressed with Harris’ preparation and well-informed questions behind the scenes on the issue. But he said that the administration’s focus on oversight when investing the funds and deterring illegal migration was critical to its success.
“Then this can make a difference over five or 10 years,” Banga said.
There are other challenges, too. People who have worked with the administration for the past year and a half said that private investment was not enough as the United States competes with other countries, especially China, for investment in the region.
Executives with some of the companies who pledged to spend millions of dollars over the course of the next five years or so said they would also need regulatory changes and adjustments to tariffs if they wanted to be successful in the long run.
They will also need infrastructure to support their investments — roads, internet and power — and a total scale of spending by other similar companies. Both are things that China has embraced as it spreads investments through Asia, Africa and Latin America.
In response, the administration said Monday that Harris would announce a program aimed at increasing investment in infrastructure in the region.
The program aims to help companies gain access to funding from the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. and will create a Northern Central America Investment Facilitation Team intended to promote economic development. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Shaking Up Market For Nutrition Drinks Proves Challenging: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In 2018, Barry Nalebuff's 89-year-old father entered the hospital for hip surgery and came out a daily drinker of the nutritional shake Ensure, which his doctor recommended. Mr. Nalebuff, a professor at the Yale School of Management and a founder of Honest Tea, blanched when he read the back of the bottle: After water, the first two ingredients were corn maltodextrin and sugar.
With Honest Tea, Mr. Nalebuff and his co-founder, Seth Goldman, had challenged sugary drinks like Snapple and Arizona, and their Honest Kids juices took aim at Capri Sun and Hi-C. Now he wondered: Could he do something similar for seniors, with a better-for-you challenger to Boost and Ensure?
Mr. Nalebuff teamed up with James Murphy, who he met through Yale, and David Perlmutter, a neurologist and author of several books on the relationship between diet and chronic disease, to develop Choose Health, a shake intended to promote longevity. It was to be organic, low in sugar and a better provider of fiber, probiotics and omega-3s than existing offerings. But four years later, it has yet to hit shelves.
"We brought Honest Tea to market within six months, and we thought we could do something similar here," Mr. Nalebuff said. "Turns out, this is so much more complicated."
In recent decades, upstarts have invaded practically every aisle of the grocery store, wearing away at powerhouse brands with products that were sustainable, organic, plant-based, gluten-free and whole grain. Chobani overtook Yoplait with its low-sugar, high-protein yogurts. Popchips and Pirate's Booty now sit alongside Lay's potato chips. In the baby food aisle, pouches of puréed blueberries and spinach are in; Gerber's glass jars of stewed pears are out.
There is one product category, however, that has remained stubbornly unchanged: When it comes to grandma's nutritional shake, Ensure and Boost still rule the market.
Mr. Nalebuff and his colleagues are beginning to understand why. The complexity of their product and supply chain issues have factored into the difficulty of starting Choose Health. But Ensure and Boost's deep ties within the health care system also make unseating them an exceptional challenge.
From Hospitals to Health Drink
Ensure was developed in 1973 by Abbott -- the maker of Similac infant formula, pharmaceuticals, diabetes monitors and Binax Covid testing kits -- as a solution for patients suffering malnourishment as they recovered in hospitals. Patients unable to eat solid food had previously subsisted on concoctions blended up in hospital cafeterias, but the process was cumbersome, and the liquefied foods were not very tasty.
Abbott already had a baby formula business, and realized it could produce an adult version in the same facilities from many of the same sugars, proteins, oils, vitamins and minerals. Ensure's milky drinks were calorie-dense, inexpensive, convenient and able to serve as a sole source of nutrition for vulnerable patients, which turned them into a commercial success.
By the 1990s, however, hospitals were driving harder bargains, and Abbott went searching for new avenues for growth. Since then, the company has marketed Ensure to healthy older consumers searching for ways to gain longevity.
Today, Abbott's adult nutrition business -- Ensure, plus a diabetes-friendly formulation called Glucerna and a handful of specialized clinical nutrition brands -- generates $ 4 billion in revenue annually, and is growing at a steady clip: U.S. sales increased 6 percent in 2021, the most recent period for which data is available. There are now almost a dozen different varieties of Ensure.
Boost, a smaller competitor that was developed by the infant formula company Mead Johnson in 1995 and has been owned by Nestle since 2007, has its own suite of products to match.
To what extent these drinks provide benefits to adults capable of eating solid food is a matter of some debate. "I looked at the ingredient list of these things and I wouldn't consume them," said David Katz, a preventive medicine specialist and the founder and former director of Yale's Prevention Research Center. "They're extremely concentrated in added sugar."
Advertisements for Ensure and Boost have been cited by the Center for Science in the Public Interest for what it calls misleading claims about their benefits, from their ability to help rebuild muscle mass to their role in supporting immune function. In 1997, Abbott settled on Federal Trade Commission charges that it made false and unsubstantiated claims in a national advertising campaign by saying doctors recommended Ensure as meal replacement for healthy, active adults.
Josh Anthony, a nutrition scientist and physiologist who worked on the Boost brand while it was still owned by Mead Johnson and currently runs a nutrition consultancy called Nlumn, sees a disconnect between the drinks' original purpose and the role some consumers want them to fulfill.
"These products are well designed for what they were originally intended to do, which is to help support nutritional needs for patients who couldn't get enough energy from food alone," Mr. Anthony said. "But are they optimized for a wealthier Boomer seeking performance benefits? No."
New Products Meet Roadblocks
Entrepreneurs want to fill that gap. Older Americans hold a majority of the country's wealth, which helps make a nutrition drink aimed at seniors appealing.
But Ensure and Boost have a leg up on reaching older customers, who are often first exposed to the brands in a hospital, where a doctor or dietitian recommends them. Retail sales are more profitable, but a presence in hospitals is critical to acquiring customers and driving brand credibility.
Steve Allen, who worked at Nestle while it looked at developing a rival product, recalls the halo effect of a doctor's recommendation. "If you showed people a product identical in nutrition to Ensure at 50 percent lower cost and asked them if they would buy it, they'd say no," said Mr. Allen, who is now a partner at the venture capital firm Digitalis Ventures.
Abbott also employs hundreds of sales representatives who call on doctors to educate them about the benefits of its products, and the companies also typically keep hospitals and doctors offices stocked with free samples for patients.
Brent Taylor, a co-founder of the alternative protein company Beyond Meat, describes Ensure and Boost's relationships with hospitals as a major roadblock in starting Perennial, a plant-based nutrition drink geared toward seniors, in 2019. "You're competing against 'the No. 1 doctor recommended brand,"' Mr. Taylor said, referring to Ensure's pervasive marketing message. "That's a real challenge, and very capital intensive."
Recommendations from health professionals are especially valuable in a market where the typical playbook for a consumer product start-up -- rely on digital marketing to drive direct-to-consumer sales, then encourage retailers to stock the product in stores -- may not be as effective. Seniors are less willing to buy something online than younger consumers.
"When we would sample at pickleball courts, the question that always came up was, 'Where can I go buy this?"' Mr. Taylor said. "They meant physical stores, not online." He and his co-founder, Sara Bonham, shuttered Perennial in 2021, after failing to secure additional capital.
For an upstart brand, cracking into hospital distribution amounts to a moonshot. Hospitals typically enter multiyear contracts with either Abbott or Nestle to provide a broad portfolio of clinical nutrition products -- and, in Abbott's case, a host of other medical supplies. In some cases, these contracts are exclusive; the hospital must use Abbott or Nestle for its clinical nutrition needs to maintain special pricing. In others, volume discounts or rebates discourage new products from competitors.
When Andrew Abraham started an organic nutrition company called Orgain in 2009, he discovered early on the power that incumbents wield.
"I would go into these hospitals with a case of Orgain to give to nutritionists, and I was so proud that I could do it, because it was a big expense for me," he said. "I'd turn the corner in the hospital and see a pallet of Ensure. "
Mr. Abraham instead expanded the brand through a mix of retail and online sales, eventually adding plant-based protein powders, as well as a nutritional shake for children. Nestle recently bought a controlling stake in Orgain, and is helping it expand in the health care system.
A nutrition brand called Kate Farms that makes organic, plant-based shakes has managed to find a toehold after more than $ 100 million of fund-raising. Brett Matthews, the company's chairman and chief executive, said that after investing behind extensive clinical research, navigating the complex process of qualifying for insurance reimbursement and building a large portfolio to fill a hospital's needs, the drink is in 800 hospitals.
Many within the industry expect more new products geared toward older adults. Science on which dietary interventions may slow physical decline is developing rapidly, and consumers are more nutritionally savvy.
Just look at what has happened with infant formula. Here Abbott also remains the category leader, but has had to defend against competitors like Earth's Best, Happy Family Organics, and Bobbie, which appeal to millennial parents who are looking for ingredients like grass-fed dairy and organic coconut oil. As those same consumers become caregivers for their aging parents -- and then become aging parents themselves -- it stands to reason they will take the same approach.
In the meantime, absent major breakthroughs, those who can chew and swallow enough food to maintain a healthy weight may be better off just skipping the shake, said Mr. Katz, the preventive medicine physician.
"We have vivid evidence of what works, from places in the world where people live to be a hundred or more with their cognition intact," Mr. Katz said. Those subjects are physically active and maintain a proper diet and sleep habits, he said, adding, "They're not drinking nutrition shakes."

At the Extremes, He Found the Joy: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: When Charles Munch started work as the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the fall of 1949, he gave a speech.
There wasn't much he could say, in truth. His English was poor, though he had just sacrificed an umlaut in his surname in deference to American spelling. An Alsatian sometimes known in Germany as Karl, and in France always as Charles, he had served the Kaiser on the Somme in the First World War, then defended French culture in resistance to the Nazis in the Second. If he bothered to hold a rehearsal at all, he spoke to his musicians in a variety of languages, or let his gestures, flamboyant yet intentional, do the talking.
Munch wanted to make one thing clear to the Bostonians, though: He was not their former music director, Serge Koussevitzky. The orchestra's players had toiled under him, an autocrat whose shadow lingered over Munch, too. Even after Munch died in 1968 -- while touring the United States with the Orchestre de Paris, which he had formed a year before -- his New York Times obituary labored over the comparison with his predecessor, describing his task as having been "on a par with trying to follow Thomas Alva Edison as an inventor or Magellan as a navigator."
Yet Munch had no interest in being Koussevitzky's kind of maestro; once a Stradivarius-wielding concertmaster himself, he saw no artistic or human point in making a musician miserable. As Time reported in a cover story in December 1949, he spent his first weeks in Boston telling his players that they could rest easier. In his introductory remarks, he told them that "there will be joy." For him, "beauty, joy and goodness" were the calling of an artist. As such, music, as he said in 1954, could offer "reconciliation with life itself." Munch was shy and private when his baton was not slicing through sound; his biographer, D. Kern Holoman, has argued that conducting gave him relief from sadness of all sorts, whether the grief of enduring two wars between the cultures that claimed him, or the anguish of an unhappy marriage. (Holoman taught at the University of California, Davis, until 2017, when he left over rape allegations.)
Conducting may have given Munch relief, but perhaps not deliverance. His interpretations could be as extreme as his times, at one moment outlandishly swift or brutally violent, contemplative or uncommonly tender the next, giddy fun at the last. The critic Virgil Thomson wrote of his approach to Franck's Symphony that "he plays it very slow and very fast, very soft and very loud, reins it in and whips it up, gives it (and us) a huge workout." That description fits more broadly; Munch was the rare conductor who welcomed imprecisions, even coarseness of tone, in his pursuit of outright spontaneity. An objectivist he was not.
All this and more is clear from Munch's enthralling discography. His Boston recordings for the RCA label were collated in an 86-disc Sony set in 2016; it has sold out, but most of the contents are still on streaming platforms. Warner and Eloquence have since separately boxed their catalogs of his pre- and post-Boston releases, giving a sense of Munch from his first sessions, with the pianist Alfred Cortot in Saint-Saëns in 1935, to his last, with the Orchestre de Paris in Ravel in 1968. Munch was a different musician under studio conditions than he was live, Holoman writes, and he controlled his most explosive tendencies in the hope of making records that would last. Even his two incendiary Boston readings of Berlioz's "Symphonie Fantastique," his trademark piece, come nowhere close to the maelstrom he inflamed onstage. He dared one of the world's most proficient orchestras to play beyond itself in concert; some of his finest releases -- his Schubert Ninth, his Mendelssohn Third -- are, conversely, those in which he builds tension by refusing to let go as blatantly as he might in front of an audience.
Even so, sample Munch's recordings -- more than the Berlioz, Debussy and Ravel in which he was justly celebrated -- and it is hard to disagree with the verdict of the Times critic Howard Taubman, who wrote of a 1950 concert: "Whether the music is illuminated or driven, it is never just respectable or indifferent. It is alive; it is the natural outgrowth of the conductor's point of view."

MUNCH WAS BORN in Strasbourg, which was then in Germany, on Sept. 26, 1891, into a dynasty of musicians. His father, Ernest, mounted a Bach revival leading the church choir of Saint-Guillaume; his brother, Fritz, was a conductor and conservatory director; his uncle Eugène was an organist who taught Albert Schweitzer, whose friendship and spirituality influenced Charles throughout his life.
Charles learned all kinds of instruments, like a little Bach might, but settled on the violin and was playing under his father's baton by his early teens. He went to Paris in 1912 to study with Lucien Capet, a famed quartet violinist, but returned home to his family days before Germany invaded Belgium. Conscripted into the German army with two brothers, he was injured as an artilleryman at Verdun; he subsequently embraced pacifism and took succor in music.
The common critique of Munch as a mature conductor was that his volatility ill fit works in the Haydn-to-Brahms tradition, but he had a strong training in the Romantic school of German conducting. After playing as the concertmaster of the Strasbourg orchestra from 1919 to 1924, he spent a year under Hermann Abendroth in Cologne, then held the same post at the Gewandhaus Orchestra of Leipzig for six seasons, working for Wilhelm Furtwängler and Bruno Walter. His return to Paris in 1932 to start his podium career -- with Brahms's First -- was made possible by the wealth of the Nestlé heiress Geneviève Maury, his new wife.
At first, Munch was renowned for supporting new music, and during World War II, he made his allegiances clear by protecting and promoting French composers. At the helm of the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire, France's leading ensemble, Munch told his players in September 1940 that it was through art that they could "continue the fight." One of his most intimate friends, the pianist Nicole Henriot, would have her hand crushed by the Gestapo; Munch joined the Resistance, helped those he could, and tried to avoid compromising situations.
Research on the culture of wartime France by Jane F. Fulcher, Leslie A. Sprout and other scholars has suggested that while the Nazis visited horrors on Jewish artists, neither the occupiers nor their Vichy collaborators -- nor their Resistance opponents -- sought to curtail concert life. Most musicians in the Resistance carried on as if the occupation did not exist; French music, except that by Jews, was not banned. Careful still to tend to proud Parisian traditions in the Germanic classics, Munch spent much of the war showcasing contemporary scores, such as politically ambiguous new works like Honegger's Second Symphony and pieces that had been written in Nazi camps, including Jean Martinon's "Stalag IX."
Munch and the Société became so busy, they reached a strikingly high standard. Their wartime recordings, now in the Warner box, are remarkable for their calm, even in "La Mer" or "La Valse." After their liberation, they let loose for Decca; the Eloquence set superbly reproduces the orchestra's distinctive postwar timbre, as well as Munch's intensity of expression. There is crisp Beethoven, heartbreaking Tchaikovsky, delicate yet eager Ravel. An account of Berlioz's "Le Corsaire," from May 1948, is so exhilarating, it is little surprise that the authorities were reluctant to let Munch leave. BUT LEAVE MUNCH DID. On an initial visit to the United States that started near the end of 1946, he enjoyed the New York Philharmonic yet found the Boston Symphony to be "the culmination of all orchestras," as he told The Boston Globe. He led that ensemble in only seven concerts before he signed a contract to become its permanent conductor, in March 1948. Despite a brutal schedule that included the first tour by an American orchestra in the Soviet Union, in 1956, he stayed through 1962.
While George Szell was giving the Cleveland Orchestra a focused power, and Eugene Ormandy sought glitter and gold in Philadelphia, Munch brightened Boston's formerly dark hues, bringing its strident brass and cutting winds to the fore -- most prominently the quivering principal flute of Doriot Anthony Dwyer, who became the only woman in the orchestra after Munch hired her in 1952.
Critics heard the transparent, though dry, results as typically French, but the ensemble's fervor -- its blare, some said -- under Munch was his own, removed from the grace that his mentor, Pierre Monteux, drew from the same players. If Thomson had warned the Symphony in 1944 that "its form is perfect, but it does not communicate," after a decade of Munch, the reverse might have been more true.
The cliché about Munch's Boston Symphony was that it was all but a Parisian ensemble in exile. "When I was living in New York in the '50s," Michael Steinberg of The Globe wrote in 1964, "I used to imagine Symphony Hall as the scene of a more or less perpetual performance of the Berlioz 'Symphonie Fantastique,' relieved now and again by 'Daphnis and Chloe' and 'La Mer."' That slur notwithstanding, Munch's advocacy was unwavering and proud: His Berlioz, Debussy and Ravel were references for a generation.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Although the beauties of Munch's Boston-era recordings of French music are great, some of them stray intriguingly from the norm. He rarely treated Debussy or Ravel as scores only to paint with prettily: For all their gorgeous interplay of voices, there is often a bite to them, as if Munch were deliberately placing them in a lineage that ran back to Berlioz and forward to Roussel and Honegger, and later Dutilleux. Once or twice, his own loneliness breaks through; he draws out "Le Jardin Féerique," at the end of "Ma Mère l'Oye," until it is tear-inducingly poignant.
Still, Munch's tastes were broad, and he could be as fascinating beyond the French repertory. As a matter of principle and proclivity, he kept up Koussevitzky's loyalty to new music, ardently recording Piston, Martinu and other works that he premiered. He largely avoided Germany after the war, but the most performed composers in his first decade in Boston were Beethoven, Mozart, Bach and Brahms. Little of his hard-driven Mozart and already-outdated Bach survive, but his Brahms was strong, and his Beethoven full of ideas. Some of those ideas work, and some do not, but that's the reminder that Munch offers today: Virtuosity is empty without the thrill of interpretive risk. "He was without peer in the things he did best and, even in the things he did worst, never less than interesting," the critic Martin Bernheimer wrote after his death. "There are few like him left."

When Charles Munch started work as the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the fall of 1949, he gave a speech.

He went to Paris in 1912 to study with Lucien Capet, a famed quartet violinist, but returned home to his family days before Germany invaded Belgium. Conscripted into the German army with two brothers, he was injured as an artilleryman at Verdun; he subsequently embraced pacifism and took succor in music.
The common critique of Munch as a mature conductor was that his volatility ill fit works in the Haydn-to-Brahms tradition, but he had a strong training in the Romantic school of German conducting.
After playing as the concertmaster of the Strasbourg orchestra from 1919 to 1924, he spent a year under Hermann Abendroth in Cologne, then held the same post at the Gewandhaus Orchestra of Leipzig for six seasons, working for Wilhelm Furtwängler and Bruno Walter.
His return to Paris in 1932 to start his podium career — with Brahms’ First — was made possible by the wealth of Nestlé heiress Geneviève Maury, his new wife.
At first, Munch was renowned for supporting new music, and during World War II, he made his allegiances clear by protecting and promoting French composers. At the helm of the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire, France’s leading ensemble, Munch told his players in September 1940 that it was through art that they could “continue the fight.” One of his most intimate friends, pianist Nicole Henriot, would have her hand crushed by the Gestapo; Munch joined the Resistance, helped those he could, and tried to avoid compromising situations.
Research on the culture of wartime France by Jane F. Fulcher, Leslie A. Sprout and other scholars has suggested that while the Nazis visited horrors on Jewish artists, neither the occupiers nor their Vichy collaborators — nor their Resistance opponents — sought to curtail concert life. Most musicians in the Resistance carried on as if the occupation did not exist; French music, except that by Jews, was not banned.
Careful still to tend to proud Parisian traditions in the Germanic classics, Munch spent much of the war showcasing contemporary scores, such as politically ambiguous new works like Honegger’s Second Symphony and pieces that had been written in Nazi camps, including Jean Martinon’s “Stalag IX.”
Munch and the Société became so busy, they reached a strikingly high standard. Their wartime recordings, now in the Warner box, are remarkable for their calm, even in “La Mer” or “La Valse.” After their liberation, they let loose for Decca; the Eloquence set superbly reproduces the orchestra’s distinctive postwar timbre, as well as Munch’s intensity of expression. There is crisp Beethoven, heartbreaking Tchaikovsky, delicate yet eager Ravel. An account of Berlioz’s “Le Corsaire,” from May 1948, is so exhilarating, it is little surprise that authorities were reluctant to let Munch leave.
But he did.
On an initial visit to the United States that started near the end of 1946, Munch enjoyed the New York Philharmonic yet found the Boston Symphony to be “the culmination of all orchestras,” as he told The Boston Globe. He led that ensemble in only seven concerts before he signed a contract to become its permanent conductor, in March 1948. Despite a brutal schedule that included the first tour by an American orchestra in the Soviet Union, in 1956, he stayed through 1962.
While George Szell was giving the Cleveland Orchestra a focused power, and Eugene Ormandy sought glitter and gold in Philadelphia, Munch brightened Boston’s formerly dark hues, bringing its strident brass and cutting winds to the fore — most prominently the quivering principal flute of Doriot Anthony Dwyer, who became the only woman in the orchestra after Munch hired her in 1952.
Critics heard the transparent, though dry, results as typically French, but the ensemble’s fervor — its blare, some said — under Munch was his own, removed from the grace that his mentor, Pierre Monteux, drew from the same players. If Thomson had warned the Symphony in 1944 that “its form is perfect, but it does not communicate,” after a decade of Munch, the reverse might have been more true.
The cliché about Munch’s Boston Symphony was that it was all but a Parisian ensemble in exile.
“When I was living in New York in the ’50s,” Michael Steinberg of The Globe wrote in 1964, “I used to imagine Symphony Hall as the scene of a more or less perpetual performance of the Berlioz ‘Symphonie Fantastique,’ relieved now and again by ‘Daphnis and Chloe’ and ‘La Mer.’” That slur notwithstanding, Munch’s advocacy was unwavering and proud: His Berlioz, Debussy and Ravel were references for a generation.
Although the beauties of Munch’s Boston-era recordings of French music are great, some of them stray intriguingly from the norm. He rarely treated Debussy or Ravel as scores only to paint with prettily: For all their gorgeous interplay of voices, there is often a bite to them, as if Munch were deliberately placing them in a lineage that ran back to Berlioz and forward to Roussel and Honegger, and later Dutilleux. Once or twice, his own loneliness breaks through; he draws out “Le Jardin Féerique,” at the end of “Ma Mère l’Oye,” until it is tear-inducingly poignant.
Still, Munch’s tastes were broad, and he could be as fascinating beyond the French repertory. As a matter of principle and proclivity, he kept up Koussevitzky’s loyalty to new music, ardently recording Piston, Martinu and other works that he premiered. He largely avoided Germany after the war, but the most performed composers in his first decade in Boston were Beethoven, Mozart, Bach and Brahms. Little of his hard-driven Mozart and already-outdated Bach survive, but his Brahms was strong, and his Beethoven full of ideas.
Some of those ideas work, and some do not, but that’s the reminder that Munch offers today: Virtuosity is empty without the thrill of interpretive risk.
“He was without peer in the things he did best and, even in the things he did worst, never less than interesting,” critic Martin Bernheimer wrote after his death. “There are few like him left.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

In 2018, Barry Nalebuff’s 89-year-old father entered the hospital for hip surgery and came out a daily drinker of the nutritional shake Ensure, which his doctor recommended. Nalebuff, a professor at the Yale School of Management and a founder of Honest Tea, blanched when he read the back of the bottle: After water, the first two ingredients were corn maltodextrin and sugar.
With Honest Tea, Nalebuff and his co-founder, Seth Goldman, had challenged sugary drinks like Snapple and Arizona, and their Honest Kids juices took aim at Capri Sun and Hi-C. Now he wondered: Could he do something similar for seniors, with a better-for-you challenger to Boost and Ensure?
Nalebuff teamed up with James Murphy, whom he met through Yale, and David Perlmutter, a neurologist and author of several books on the relationship between diet and chronic disease, to develop Choose Health, a shake intended to promote longevity. It was to be organic, low in sugar and a better provider of fiber, probiotics and omega-3s than existing offerings. But four years later, it has yet to hit shelves.
“We brought Honest Tea to market within six months, and we thought we could do something similar here,” Nalebuff said. “Turns out, this is so much more complicated.”
In recent decades, upstarts have invaded practically every aisle of the grocery store, wearing away at powerhouse brands with products that were sustainable, organic, plant-based, gluten-free and whole grain. Chobani overtook Yoplait with its low-sugar, high-protein yogurts. Popchips and Pirate’s Booty now sit alongside Lay’s potato chips. In the baby food aisle, pouches of puréed blueberries and spinach are in; Gerber’s glass jars of stewed pears are out.
There is one product category, however, that has remained stubbornly unchanged: When it comes to grandma’s nutritional shake, Ensure and Boost still rule the market.
Nalebuff and his colleagues are beginning to understand why. The complexity of their product and supply chain issues have factored into the difficulty of starting Choose Health. But Ensure’s and Boost’s deep ties within the health care system also make unseating them an exceptional challenge.
From Hospitals to Health Drink
Ensure was developed in 1973 by Abbott — the maker of Similac infant formula, pharmaceuticals, diabetes monitors and Binax COVID testing kits — as a solution for patients suffering malnourishment as they recovered in hospitals. Patients unable to eat solid food had previously subsisted on concoctions blended up in hospital cafeterias, but the process was cumbersome, and the liquefied foods were not very tasty.
Abbott already had a baby formula business and realized it could produce an adult version in the same facilities from many of the same sugars, proteins, oils, vitamins and minerals. Ensure’s milky drinks were calorie-dense, inexpensive, convenient and able to serve as a sole source of nutrition for vulnerable patients, which turned them into a commercial success.
By the 1990s, however, hospitals were driving harder bargains, and Abbott went searching for new avenues for growth. Since then, the company has marketed Ensure to healthy older consumers searching for ways to gain longevity.
Today, Abbott’s adult nutrition business — Ensure, plus a diabetes-friendly formulation called Glucerna and a handful of specialized clinical nutrition brands — generates $4 billion in revenue annually and is growing at a steady clip: U.S. sales increased 6% in 2021, the most recent period for which data is available. There are now almost a dozen different varieties of Ensure.
Boost, a smaller competitor that was developed by the infant formula company Mead Johnson in 1995 and has been owned by Nestle since 2007, has its own suite of products to match.
To what extent these drinks provide benefits to adults capable of eating solid food is a matter of some debate. “I looked at the ingredient list of these things, and I wouldn’t consume them,” said David Katz, a preventive medicine specialist and the founder and former director of Yale’s Prevention Research Center. “They’re extremely concentrated in added sugar.”
Advertisements for Ensure and Boost have been cited by the Center for Science in the Public Interest for what it calls misleading claims about their benefits, from their ability to help rebuild muscle mass to their role in supporting immune function. In 1997, Abbott settled on Federal Trade Commission charges that it made false and unsubstantiated claims in a national advertising campaign by saying doctors recommended Ensure as meal replacement for healthy, active adults.
Josh Anthony, a nutrition scientist and physiologist who worked on the Boost brand while it was still owned by Mead Johnson and currently runs a nutrition consultancy called Nlumn, sees a disconnect between the drinks’ original purpose and the role some consumers want them to fulfill.
“These products are well designed for what they were originally intended to do, which is to help support nutritional needs for patients who couldn’t get enough energy from food alone,” Anthony said. “But are they optimized for a wealthier boomer seeking performance benefits? No.”
New Products Meet Roadblocks
Entrepreneurs want to fill that gap. Older Americans hold a majority of the country’s wealth, which helps make a nutrition drink aimed at seniors appealing.
But Ensure and Boost have a leg up on reaching older customers, who are often first exposed to the brands in a hospital, where a doctor or dietitian recommends them. Retail sales are more profitable, but a presence in hospitals is critical to acquiring customers and driving brand credibility.
Steve Allen, who worked at Nestle while it looked at developing a rival product, recalls the halo effect of a doctor’s recommendation. “If you showed people a product identical in nutrition to Ensure at 50% lower cost and asked them if they would buy it, they’d say no,” said Allen, who is now a partner at the venture capital firm Digitalis Ventures.
Abbott also employs hundreds of sales representatives who call on doctors to educate them about the benefits of its products, and the companies also typically keep hospitals and doctors’ offices stocked with free samples for patients.
Brent Taylor, a co-founder of the alternative protein company Beyond Meat, describes Ensure’s and Boost’s relationships with hospitals as a major roadblock in starting Perennial, a plant-based nutrition drink geared toward seniors, in 2019. “​​You’re competing against ‘the No. 1 doctor-recommended brand,’” Taylor said, referring to Ensure’s pervasive marketing message. “That’s a real challenge, and very capital-intensive.”
Recommendations from health professionals are especially valuable in a market where the typical playbook for a consumer product startup — rely on digital marketing to drive direct-to-consumer sales, then encourage retailers to stock the product in stores — may not be as effective. Seniors are less willing to buy something online than younger consumers.
“When we would sample at pickleball courts, the question that always came up was, ‘Where can I go buy this?’” Taylor said. “They meant physical stores, not online.” He and his co-founder, Sara Bonham, shuttered Perennial in 2021 after failing to secure additional capital.
For an upstart brand, cracking into hospital distribution amounts to a moonshot. Hospitals typically enter multiyear contracts with either Abbott or Nestle to provide a broad portfolio of clinical nutrition products — and, in Abbott’s case, a host of other medical supplies. In some cases, these contracts are exclusive; the hospital must use Abbott or Nestle for its clinical nutrition needs to maintain special pricing. In others, volume discounts or rebates discourage new products from competitors.
When Andrew Abraham started an organic nutrition company called Orgain in 2009, he discovered early on the power that incumbents wield.
“I would go into these hospitals with a case of Orgain to give to nutritionists, and I was so proud that I could do it, because it was a big expense for me,” he said. “I’d turn the corner in the hospital and see a pallet of Ensure.”
Abraham instead expanded the brand through a mix of retail and online sales, eventually adding plant-based protein powders as well as a nutritional shake for children. Nestle recently bought a controlling stake in Orgain and is helping it expand in the health care system.
A nutrition brand called KateFarms that makes organic, plant-based shakes has managed to find a toehold after more than $100 million of fundraising. Brett Matthews, the company’s chair and CEO, said that after investing behind extensive clinical research, navigating the complex process of qualifying for insurance reimbursement and building a large portfolio to fill a hospital’s needs, the drink is in 800 hospitals.
Many within the industry expect more new products geared toward older adults. Science on which dietary interventions may slow physical decline is developing rapidly, and consumers are more nutritionally savvy.
Just look at what has happened with infant formula. Here Abbott also remains the category leader but has had to defend against competitors like Earth’s Best, Happy Family Organics and Bobbie, which appeal to millennial parents who are looking for ingredients like grass-fed dairy and organic coconut oil. As those same consumers become caregivers for their aging parents — and then become aging parents themselves — it stands to reason they will take the same approach.
In the meantime, absent major breakthroughs, those who can chew and swallow enough food to maintain a healthy weight may be better off just skipping the shake, said Katz, the preventive medicine physician.
“We have vivid evidence of what works, from places in the world where people live to be a hundred or more with their cognition intact,” Katz said. Those subjects are physically active and maintain a proper diet and sleep habits, he said, adding, “They’re not drinking nutrition shakes.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

And Just How Do They Taste?: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: To find out, four hungry Times staff members staged a blind tasting.
With just puréed tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and basil as toppings, a margherita is the pizza most reliant on high-quality ingredients. Because it can't hide under blankets of part-skim mozzarella or highly seasoned sauce, the flavors of dough, tomato and cheese have to shine.
What happens when you subject those elements to a freezer, then ship them around the country?
To find out, I collected three of my New York Times Food and Cooking colleagues and 11 nationally available margherita pies for a blind taste test at our kitchen studio. The other testers were Eric Kim, a columnist and recipe writer; Vaughn Vreeland, a supervising producer for NYT Cooking video; and Cathy Lo, an editor.
All of the pies came from independent pizza makers dedicated to Neapolitan-style pies, not from global food companies like Nestlé or Rich's. Four were nationally available pies produced for major grocery stores: Roberta's, Table 87, Talia di Napoli and Genio Della Pizza. Then we ordered all of the margherita pies available from artisanal pizzerias outside New York City through Goldbelly, an online marketplace for specialty food products: Pizzeria Delfina in San Francisco, Pizzana in Los Angeles, Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, La Piazza al Forno in Glendale, Ariz., Varuni Napoli in Atlanta and Dough in San Antonio. (We also included a New York stalwart, Joe & Pat's on Staten Island, to see how its margherita stacked up.)
The differences among the pies were astounding. Some had a thick schmear of tomato, others just a scrape of orange sauce; a few crusts had the puffy, raised edge characteristic of Neapolitan pizza, but others were flat, like Midwestern tavern pizza.
Surprisingly, the handmade pies shipped directly from pizzerias -- often at a price of $ 30 or more for a single 14-inch (or so) pie -- were not necessarily better tasting than the $ 11 supermarket ones.
Here, in ascending order, is how the four mass-market premium pizzas stacked up.
4. Roberta's
The generous slices of mozzarella melted into lovely puddles, but the skimpy tomato coating beneath them got lost. Roberta's famous crust seemed to have dried out in the freezing process; overall, it lacked flavor. "Not a fan," Vaughn said.
3. Table 87
Eric fell hard for the first bite of Table 87's tomato purée. Our panel agreed that this was the punchiest tomato element on any of the pies, but Vaughn pronounced it too sweet, "the Lunchables of frozen pizza." With its crackerlike crust, this pizza did seem likely to appeal to kids.
2. Talia di Napoli
This was the prettiest, most Italian-looking pizza of the bunch, something you might actually serve to adults. "You can smell the char," Cathy said. That crucial element of a classic Neapolitan crust rarely appeared at the tasting. We liked Talia's blistered, puffy edge, but the toppings had only faint flavor.
1. Genio Della Pizza
This pizza, with its lavishly oily and salty crust, smartly avoided the dryness that plagued its competitors. "Am I getting Cheese Nips?" asked Eric, who praised its aroma, a key part of the pizza-eating experience. The proportion of tomato to crust felt right, and the crust had sourdough flavor, something we missed in the other pies.
The Rest
Among the direct-from-pizzeria pies, the best cheese pull belonged to Pizzeria Bianco, and the most successful combination of chewy and crisp crust came from Pizzana. Best overall went to Delfina, in the Bay Area, for its clear, fresh flavors.
The eternal X factor in frozen pizza is what you do to it at home. Each pizza included reheating instructions, none of which were the same, and oven temperatures ranged from 425 to 500 degrees. The brands are divided on whether to use a pizza stone, a baking sheet or just an oven rack, and they disagreed about whether pizza can or should thaw before heating.
It's fine to let these premium pies thaw; in fact, like most foods, they will cook more evenly. If you don't have a stone and don't want to risk spilling onto the oven floor, stick a baking sheet in the oven while it's heating, turn it upside down and slide the pizza onto the back. Then keep an eye on it until it's cooked the way you like it.
"I think most of us know what pizza looks like when it's done," said Chris Bianco, the founder of Pizzeria Bianco. "People are smart, and directions are overrated."

The Restless Quest for Better Frozen Pizza: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Since 1962, when the Minneapolis entrepreneur Rose Totino introduced it to American shoppers, frozen pizza has been an after-school snack, the quickest route to dinner, a midnight temptation of last resort.
But in the last five years, frozen pizza has become something else entirely: a piece of culinary craft, an authentic taste of Italy, a connection to buzzy pizzerias like Roberta's in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and Pizzana in Los Angeles and Dallas.
Sales of frozen food surged during the pandemic, according to IRI and other market research firms, boosting premium mass-produced brands like Talia di Napoli and Table 87, and pushing even the most traditional pizzaiolos toward the freezer aisle.
The challenge of pizza is to cook each element to peak deliciousness at once. When ice and shipping are added to the equation, that becomes even more complicated. Fresh mozzarella becomes clumpy, tomatoes dry out, crusts become soggy.
New freezing technology and affordable access to express shipping have made it possible for more options to slide into freezers. But they're not coming out of frozen-food factories owned by industry giants like Nestlé or Rich's. These new pies are wood- or coal-fired, hand-pulled and made with organic and Italian ingredients.
What they lack in the lavishness of a Tombstone Roadhouse Loaded Double Down Deluxe pizza, they strive to make up for in simplicity and quality. Like a Starbucks Frappucino and a double espresso, producers say, there is a time and a place for each.
Chris Bianco, the chef and owner of Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, didn't even offer takeout or delivery until the pandemic. Now, he freezes and ships pies directly from his restaurant via the online delivery service Goldbelly. "Survival is an interesting motivator for change," said Mr. Bianco, a notorious purist who uses flour made from regenerative grains, organic mozzarella and organic tomatoes.
"It's pizza played at a different speed," he said of his frozen pies. "I think we could eat better things that are built for speed, comfort and deliciousness."
Anthony Mangieri, the founder of Una Pizza Napoletana in Manhattan, said he has made every ball of pizza dough he has ever served during his 30 years in the business. But in 2017, he set out on a new quest: to create a frozen pizza that would meet his standards -- wood-fired, slow-risen, fashioned from all-natural and all-Italian ingredients -- but made almost entirely with automation.
In the United States, industrially produced pies from companies like DiGiorno and Red Baron are engineered for freezing using dough conditioners, additives and processed cheeses. The crusts are infused with sugar and oil, the dough is par-baked, and the sauce and cheese are applied raw, to be cooked in your oven.
For bakers like Mr. Mangieri, this completely ignores the essential nature of pizza: the slow, natural rise of the dough, and an oven's high heat to fuse the ingredients and char the crust.
Mr. Mangieri eventually found a plant in Northern Italy with wood-fired ovens to produce his frozen pies, which he sells under the name Genio Della Pizza. But the factory managers were vexed by his strict rules and sticky dough, which gummed up the works. Mr. Mangieri, a Formula One fan who knew that Ferrari's headquarters, the pride of the region, were nearby, begged the pizza manufacturer to think of his pizza as a next-generation Ferrari engine.
"If we aren't pushing to be better, why are we even getting up in the morning?" he said.
Especially for products made with unprocessed ingredients, quick freezing is essential in preserving taste, aroma and texture. Once confined to factories, blast-chilling technology now has a much smaller footprint and is available to mom-and-pop pizza chains at relatively affordable prices.
When the pandemic temporarily shuttered the five popular Pizzeria Delfina restaurants in the Bay Area, the owners, Craig and Annie Stoll, began taking online orders for frozen pizza, making and freezing pies themselves and hauling a truck full of Igloo coolers to roadside delivery points. What saved the business, Ms. Stoll said, was the blast freezer they bought for $ 15,000.
It's now possible to order frozen pizzas from some of the country's best pizzerias, either directly or through Goldbelly.
But it is not cheap: Three frozen margherita pies from Pizzeria Delfina, a favorite among four New York Times Food and Cooking staffers in a recent blind pizza tasting, cost $ 104.95 including Goldbelly shipping. Four pies from Pizzeria Bianco cost $ 129.95, or about $ 32.50 per pie. (The same pizza costs $ 20 at the original pizzeria in Phoenix, and $ 24 in the Los Angeles store that opened last year.)
But the pizzas produced specifically for the freezer aisle of grocery stores are more competitively priced. Table 87, Roberta's, Talia di Napoli and Genio Della Pizza all charge about $ 11 for a 14-inch pizza that theoretically serves three people, though two seems realistic and one entirely possible.
Mr. Mangieri said that making his Genio Della Pizza pizzas in Italy keeps the price down because heavy ingredients like buffalo mozzarella and canned plum tomatoes are available in bulk and don't have to travel to the United States.
Elly Truesdell, who advises and invests in small food companies through her venture capital fund New Fare, was director of new products at Whole Foods Market 10 years ago, during what she calls "the premiumization of the frozen aisle."
Although premium frozen products remain more expensive than conventional counterparts like DiGiorno, she said, they provide a chef-driven experience that's cheaper than going out to restaurants.
When Roberta's and Table 87 ventured into the national market, their pizzas' visual appeal, restaurant heritage and unprocessed ingredients were so distinguishable from their competitors that buyers found the products irresistible, Ms. Truesdell said.
The whole point of frozen pizza, though, is to become mainstream. Pizza takes up more space in supermarket freezers than any other product except ice cream, and introducing a new product into that space is difficult.
One way to carve out a spot is to stand out from the competition. Tom Cucco, a longtime Brooklyn restaurateur, started with a very specific dream: to open a pizzeria that sold coal-oven pizza by the slice. (Famously, old-school New York pizzerias like Totonno's and John's of Bleecker Street make only whole pies, to order.) He opened Table 87 in Brooklyn in 2012, and gained a following for his margherita.
His son Robert said no one but his father thought it was a good idea to sell individually packed frozen slices. Though a deal resulting from his pitch on the show "Shark Tank" ultimately fell through, the slices took off and are now sold at Walmart, Wegmans and Whole Foods -- an enviable retail trifecta.
In addition to the demands of the pandemic, many makers credit Joe Ariel, the founder of Goldbelly, for hauling them over the final hurdles to selling and shipping frozen pizza. The company, which handles orders and shipping for nearly 1,000 food businesses around the United States, sends members of its logistics and packaging-science team to get each vendor up to speed on best practices for freezing.
Pizza is the fastest-growing segment on the site, even without the help of the Super Bowl on Feb. 12. Depending on the draw, frozen tomato pies from Corropolese in Philadelphia or pizzas from the St. Louis chain Imo's are likely to dominate.
"People will be stuffing themselves with the taste of home," Mr. Ariel said. "Obviously, seeing Billy Joel at the Garden is the experience, but you're not going to not listen to Spotify."

Since 1962, when Minneapolis entrepreneur Rose Totino introduced it to American shoppers, frozen pizza has been an after-school snack, the quickest route to dinner, a midnight temptation of last resort.
But in the past five years, frozen pizza has become something else entirely: a piece of culinary craft, an authentic taste of Italy, a connection to buzzy pizzerias like Roberta’s in New York’s Brooklyn borough, and Pizzana in Los Angeles and Dallas.
Sales of frozen food surged during the pandemic, according to IRI and other market research firms, boosting premium mass-produced brands like Talia di Napoli and Table 87, and pushing even the most traditional pizzaiolos toward the freezer aisle.
The challenge of pizza is to cook each element to peak deliciousness at once. When ice and shipping are added to the equation, that becomes even more complicated. Fresh mozzarella becomes clumpy, tomatoes dry out, crusts become soggy.
New freezing technology and affordable access to express shipping have made it possible for more options to slide into freezers. But they’re not coming out of frozen food factories owned by industry giants like Nestlé or Rich’s. These new pies are wood- or coal-fired, hand-pulled and made with organic and Italian ingredients.
What they lack in the lavishness of a Tombstone Roadhouse Loaded Double Down Deluxe pizza, they strive to make up for in simplicity and quality. Like a Starbucks Frappucino and a double espresso, producers say, there is a time and a place for each.
Chris Bianco, the chef and owner of Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, didn’t even offer takeout or delivery until the pandemic. Now, he freezes and ships pies directly from his restaurant via the online delivery service Goldbelly. “Survival is an interesting motivator for change,” said Bianco, a notorious purist who uses flour made from regenerative grains, organic mozzarella and organic tomatoes.
“It’s pizza played at a different speed,” he said of his frozen pies. “I think we could eat better things that are built for speed, comfort and deliciousness.”
Anthony Mangieri, the founder of Una Pizza Napoletana in New York’s Manhattan borough, said he has made every ball of pizza dough he has ever served during his 30 years in the business. But in 2017, he set out on a new quest: to create a frozen pizza that would meet his standards — wood-fired, slow-risen, fashioned from all-natural and all-Italian ingredients — but made almost entirely with automation.
In the United States, industrially produced pies from companies like DiGiorno and Red Baron are engineered for freezing using dough conditioners, additives and processed cheeses. The crusts are infused with sugar and oil, the dough is par-baked, and the sauce and cheese are applied raw, to be cooked in your oven.
For bakers like Mangieri, this completely ignores the essential nature of pizza: the slow, natural rise of the dough, and an oven’s high heat to fuse the ingredients and char the crust.
Mangieri eventually found a plant in Northern Italy with wood-fired ovens to produce his frozen pies, which he sells under the name Genio Della Pizza. But the factory managers were vexed by his strict rules and sticky dough, which gummed up the works. Mangieri, a Formula One fan who knew that Ferrari’s headquarters, the pride of the region, were nearby, begged the pizza manufacturer to think of his pizza as a next-generation Ferrari engine.
“If we aren’t pushing to be better, why are we even getting up in the morning?” he said.
Especially for products made with unprocessed ingredients, quick freezing is essential in preserving taste, aroma and texture. Once confined to factories, blast-chilling technology now has a much smaller footprint and is available to mom-and-pop pizza chains at relatively affordable prices.
When the pandemic temporarily shuttered the five popular Pizzeria Delfina restaurants in the Bay Area, the owners, Craig and Annie Stoll, began taking online orders for frozen pizza, making and freezing pies themselves and hauling a truck full of Igloo coolers to roadside delivery points. What saved the business, Annie Stoll said, was the blast freezer they bought for $15,000.
It’s now possible to order frozen pizzas from some of the country’s best pizzerias, either directly or through Goldbelly.
But it is not cheap: Three frozen margherita pies from Pizzeria Delfina, a favorite among four New York Times Food and Cooking staffers in a recent blind pizza tasting, cost $104.95, including Goldbelly shipping. Four pies from Pizzeria Bianco cost $129.95, or about $32.50 per pie. (The same pizza costs $20 at the original pizzeria in Phoenix, and $24 in the Los Angeles store that opened last year.)
But the pizzas produced specifically for the freezer aisle of grocery stores are more competitively priced. Table 87, Roberta’s, Talia di Napoli and Genio Della Pizza all charge about $11 for a 14-inch pizza that theoretically serves three people, although two seems realistic and one entirely possible.
Mangieri said that making his Genio Della Pizza pizzas in Italy keeps the price down because heavy ingredients like buffalo mozzarella and canned plum tomatoes are available in bulk and don’t have to travel to the United States.
Elly Truesdell, who advises and invests in small food companies through her venture capital fund New Fare, was director of new products at Whole Foods Market 10 years ago, during what she calls “the premiumization of the frozen aisle.”
Although premium frozen products remain more expensive than conventional counterparts like DiGiorno, she said, they provide a chef-driven experience that’s cheaper than going out to restaurants.

Full text: For much of my life, I thought of soup as a big pot of anything.
I'd watch my mother make her version of Cuban ajiaco, simmering a seemingly ever-changing mix of meat and starchy vegetables -- malanga, calabaza, yuca, plantains -- in a pot. The only nonnegotiables were the small corn cobs that bobbed in the broth and a shower of lime juice, tangy brightness against earthy comfort. From where I stood, it seemed so effortless, so open to adaptation.
Soup is always that full of possibility. It sustains in whatever form you want it to take, whether that's a refreshing gazpacho in summer or a hefty beef stew in winter.
Its comforting properties are nothing new: Doctors have recommended chicken soup to fight colds since the 12th century. And when the first restaurants opened in France in the 1700s, the French word for "restorative" was "restaurant." What did they serve?
That's right. Soup.
Soup's simplicity is also much of its appeal. As the chef and author Samin Nosrat wrote in The Times in 2017, most soup falls into three categories (puréed, chunky and brothy), and making it requires just three things: aromatics, main ingredients and a delicious broth.
The 24 recipes (for soups and stews alike) largely follow those rules, but each is distinct and thrilling, showing off soup's long-impressive range.
Find all these recipes and more at New York Times Cooking.
Jump to: Creamy | Thick and Chunky | Brothy
ð² Creamy ð²
Butternut Squash and Green Curry Soup
Green curry paste, coconut milk and fish sauce take this butternut squash soup from Samin Nosrat to the next level. Don't skip the peanut-coconut-lemongrass topping, which draws inspiration from miang kham, a popular snack in Thailand and Laos. It adds crunch where creaminess is front and center.
Recipe: Butternut Squash and Green Curry Soup
Baked Potato Soup
Just like a baked potato, this soup from Ali Slagle is homey and comforting -- just what you want on a chilly day. And, also like a baked potato, she notes, it's all about the toppings. Burrow past the sour cream, bacon, scallions or whatever else you may choose to add to the creamy potato base: It's no hardship.
Recipe: Baked Potato Soup
Split Pea Soup
Whether you use bacon, a ham hock or paprika, Ali Slagle's recipe for a classic split pea soup is satisfyingly smoky. That smokiness infuses the split peas, which are added in two batches. The first portion is mashed to the consistency of your liking, while the second is left whole, for different textures in every bite.
Recipe: Split Pea Soup
Creamy Cauliflower Soup With Rosemary Olive Oil
Rosemary-infused olive oil sets this easy cauliflower soup apart from its brethren. Lidey Heuck has you heat and steep four herb sprigs in oil as you cook the cauliflower in an aromatic-enhanced stock for the soup. You don't have to make the croutons, but their crisp contrast is a nice touch.
Recipe: Creamy Cauliflower Soup With Rosemary Olive Oil
Red Lentil Soup
Your standard lentil soup this is not. It's brilliantly orange from red lentils, bright from lemon and earthy from cumin. Melissa Clark based this recipe on the Turkish soup mercimek corbasi, and it has taken its place among New York Times Cooking's classics, with nearly 20,000 five-star reviews to its name.
Recipe: Red Lentil Soup
Quick Tomato Soup With Grilled Cheese
A soup ... and a sandwich! This recipe from Eric Kim provides the two halves of a cherished whole in 30 minutes. The soup comes together with little more than a can of tomatoes, butter and onion, reminiscent of Marcella Hazan's famed tomato sauce. Some broth, oregano and sugar round it all out. Well, and so does the grilled cheese.
Recipe: Quick Tomato Soup With Grilled Cheese
ð¥« Thick and Chunky ð¥«
Turkey Chili
This 30-year-old Pierre Franey recipe is still relevant today, maybe even more so, given its quick cook time (perfect for our busy modern lives) and its choice of lighter turkey (over the traditional but heavier beef). Use a mix of dark and white meat, if you can, for added flavor, but it'll be truly delicious -- and easy to freeze -- no matter what you use.
Recipe: Turkey Chili
Easiest Chicken Noodle Soup
Alexa Weibel may have cracked the code to fast chicken noodle soups. Other shortcut versions, she points out, rely on rotisserie chicken, which doesn't absorb flavors in the same way as the ground chicken she uses here. It absorbs whatever aromatics you cook it in, while still coming together quickly -- because speed shouldn't come at the cost of deliciousness.
Recipe: Easiest Chicken Noodle Soup
Sancocho
Sancocho is what you make it. Eaten across the Caribbean, the soup is generous, its name even used to describe "a big old mix of things," as Von Diaz, who brought this recipe to The Times, put it. Use beef or chicken, pork on the bone, or no meat at all. The beauty of sancocho is that it's ready to nourish no matter what's in your pantry.
Recipe: Sancocho
Gumbo Z'Herbes With Crab and Prawns
Falling somewhere between soup and stew, gumbo has many iterations, all personal to the cooks who make them. This version of the often-seasonal dish, from Tanya Holland of the now-closed Brown Sugar Kitchen in Oakland, Calif., is inspired by her mother's recipe and the celebrated Creole chef Leah Chase. A blend of greens bolstered with coconut milk makes up the base, which is then filled with beautifully fresh seafood for an interpretation that's at once light and filling.
Recipe: Gumbo Z'Herbes With Crab and Prawns
Kale Soup With Potatoes and Sausage
Three stalwarts of soup -- kale, potatoes and sausage -- bob up and down in this dish inspired by the Portuguese residents of Provincetown, Mass., where Molly O'Neill spent several winters. Her recipe is from 1995, long before kale was a Brooklyn-related punchline.
Recipe: Kale Soup With Potatoes and Sausage
Fresh and Wild Mushroom Stew
All stews are not created equal. David Tanis cooks brown mushrooms with herbs and onions in broth until they create a gravylike base, which he finishes with some sautéed chanterelles (or easier-to-find oyster mushrooms) for a nuanced bite. What results borders on being a ragout, lovely over polenta or pasta, but you can also have it on its own, a hearty dish to rival the beefiest stews.
Recipe: Fresh and Wild Mushroom Stew
Beef Barley Soup With Lemon
Lighter than you may expect, this beef barley soup features seared chunks of beef and lightly chewy barley, but spinach and lemon step in for the usual mushrooms. It's especially herby from a bouquet garni, which only sounds fussy in nature: By tying the herbs into a satisfying little bundle, you can spend more time eating and less time fishing around for loose stems.
Recipe: Beef Barley Soup With Lemon
Moqueca (Brazilian Seafood Stew)
This stew, which originally hails from Bahia, in northeastern Brazil, tucks shrimp and cod into a bright-red broth run through with coconut milk, tomatoes and smoky-floral red palm oil. Both "luscious and light," Yewande Komolafe wrote in an article accompanying this recipe, the broth "evokes the essence of the sea." Dive in.
Recipe: Moqueca (Brazilian Seafood Stew)
Vegetable Maafé
This highly adaptable Senegalese stew from Yewande Komolafe works no matter what root vegetables you nestle into its warming, nutty base. Keep it vegetarian as is, or add whatever meat you like for even more heft. Just be sure to make it well before serving: It's a stew that benefits from the passage of time.
Recipe: Vegetable Maafé
Sopa de Albóndigas (Mexican Meatball Soup)
Some soups are a family affair: This one was passed down from grandmother, to mother, to son, namely Wesley Avila, the chef of Guerrilla Tacos in Los Angeles. For his family's take on the traditional Mexican meatball soup, he suggests paying special attention to the grains that are mixed into the meatballs. "My mom always told me that when the rice is done, the soup is ready," Mr. Avila told Alexa Weibel, who adapted the recipe. "She used it almost as a timer."
Recipe: Sopa de Albóndigas (Mexican Meatball Soup)
Chickpea Stew With Orzo and Mustard Greens
Melissa Clark puts chickpeas front and center in this vegetable soup, which gets just a little chew from orzo. You don't have to use the mustard greens if you don't like them or can't find them. Just about any greens you have -- spinach, arugula, kale -- can take their place.
Recipe: Chickpea Stew With Orzo and Mustard Greens
Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup
A long cook -- between two and two and a half hours -- breaks down short ribs, an alternative to the gelatinous beef shins and tendons traditional to this soup. (Kenji López-Alt uses a packet of gelatin to step in for the heartiness those cuts normally lend.) What makes this soup especially nice is that it's meant to be prepared in advance. An overnight sit allows the flavors to deepen, but is also easy to make ahead for others, or for yourself.
Recipe: Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup
ð Brothy ð
French Onion Soup
Long before New York Times Cooking existed online, what was then called the Food News Department circulated pamphlets full of recipes, several of which came into the possession of Sara Bonisteel, a Food editor and frequenter of vintage cookbook stores. One pamphlet -- simply called "Soups" from 1954 -- contained this five-star classic, which Sara updated by including sherry and wine for even more flavor.
Recipe: French Onion Soup
Hot and Sour Dumpling Soup
Kay Chun keeps the tofu and mushrooms traditional of hot and sour soup, but adds frozen dumplings to the mix for heft. This mellow, velvety soup is ready in just 15 minutes and can be adjusted simply: If you prefer a little more punch, do as Kay recommends and add a bit more soy sauce, ginger and vinegar to taste.
Recipe: Hot and Sour Dumpling Soup
Italian Wedding Soup With Turkey Meatballs
A simmer in broth keeps the lean turkey meatballs moist and tender in Sarah Copeland's take on this darling of the soup world. She rolls many of the aromatics and herbs into the meatballs so there's no sautéing. It's a brilliant shortcut that gets this family-friendly recipe on the table in a breezy 30 minutes.
Recipe: Italian Wedding Soup With Turkey Meatballs
Miso Soup
This recipe, from Eric Kim, ran under the headline "How to Make the Best Miso Soup of Your Life." It's inspired by the greatest version he'd ever had, at Benkay in Portland, Maine, where the chef Seiji Ando uses extra katsuobushi (bonito flakes) in his broth. (He also adds a bit of sake and mirin.) What results is simple and complex, and truly restorative.
Recipe: Miso Soup
Brothy Thai Curry With Silken Tofu and Herbs
There's a reason this dish from Yewande Komolafe was one of New York Times Cooking's top recipes of 2022. Built on a foundation of red curry paste and coconut milk that infuse tender blocks of tofu, it's cozy and revitalizing, everything you want a simple soup to be.
Recipe: Brothy Thai Curry With Silken Tofu and Herbs
Pickle Soup (Ogórkowa Zupa)
A Polish classic with sour dill pickles at its heart, pickle soup can be creamy or brothy, depending on how you like it. This one comes from Kasia Pilat, who adapted her family's recipe from her mother's step-by-step email, complete with detailed photos. The pickles are grated, rather than chopped, and their brine is added along with them. You can add sour cream, like Kasia's mom prefers, but leaving it out lets the vegetables' flavor shine.

Soy milk can raise the risk of breast cancer. Fat-free foods are healthier than high-fat foods. Vegans and vegetarians are deficient in protein. Some false ideas about nutrition seem to linger in American culture like a terrible song stuck in your head.
So to set the record straight, we asked 10 of the top nutrition experts in the United States a simple question: What is one nutrition myth you wish would go away -- and why? Here's what they said.
Myth No. 1: Fresh fruits and vegetables are always healthier than canned, frozen or dried varieties.
Despite the enduring belief that "fresh is best," research has found that frozen, canned and dried fruits and vegetables can be just as nutritious as their fresh counterparts.
"They can also be a money saver and an easy way to make sure there are always fruits and vegetables available at home," said Sara Bleich, the outgoing director of nutrition security and health equity at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and a professor of public health policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. One caveat: Some canned, frozen and dried varieties contain sneaky ingredients like added sugars, saturated fats and sodium, Dr. Bleich said, so be sure to read nutrition labels and opt for products that keep those ingredients to a minimum.
Myth No. 2: All fat is bad.
When studies published in the late 1940s found correlations between high-fat diets and high levels of cholesterol, experts reasoned that if you reduced the amount of total fats in your diet, your risk for heart disease would go down. By the 1980s, doctors, federal health experts, the food industry and the news media were reporting that a low-fat diet could benefit everyone, even though there was no solid evidence that doing so would prevent issues like heart disease or overweight and obesity.
Dr. Vijaya Surampudi, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, Center for Human Nutrition, said that as a result, the vilification of fats led many people -- and food manufacturers -- to replace calories from fat with calories from refined carbohydrates like white flour and added sugar. (Remember SnackWell's?) "Instead of helping the country stay slim, the rates of overweight and obesity went up significantly," she said.
In reality, Dr. Surampudi added, not all fats are bad. While certain types of fats, including saturated and trans fats, can increase your risk for conditions like heart disease or stroke, healthy fats -- like monounsaturated fats (found in olive and other plant oils, avocados and certain nuts and seeds) and polyunsaturated fats (found in sunflower and other plant oils, walnuts, fish and flaxseeds) -- actually help reduce your risk. Good fats are also important for supplying energy, producing important hormones, supporting cell function and aiding in the absorption of some nutrients.
If you see a product labeled "fat-free," don't automatically assume it is healthy, Dr. Surampudi said. Instead, prioritize products with simple ingredients and no added sugars.
Myth No. 3: 'Calories in, calories out' is the most important factor for long-term weight gain.
It's true that if you consume more calories than you burn, you will probably gain weight. And if you burn more calories than you consume, you will probably lose weight -- at least for the short term.
But the research does not suggest that eating more will cause sustained weight gain that results in becoming overweight or obese. "Rather, it's the types of foods we eat that may be the long-term drivers" of those conditions, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a professor of nutrition and medicine at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. Ultraprocessed foods -- such as refined starchy snacks, cereals, crackers, energy bars, baked goods, sodas and sweets -- can be particularly harmful for weight gain, as they are rapidly digested and flood the bloodstream with glucose, fructose and amino acids, which are converted to fat by the liver. Instead, what's needed for maintaining a healthy weight is a shift from counting calories to prioritizing healthy eating overall -- quality over quantity.
Myth No. 4: People with Type 2 diabetes shouldn't eat fruit.
This myth stems from conflating fruit juices -- which can raise blood sugar levels because of their high sugar and low fiber content -- with whole fruits.
But research has found that this isn't the case. Some studies show, for instance, that those who consume one serving of whole fruit per day -- particularly blueberries, grapes and apples -- have a lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. And other research suggests that if you already have Type 2 diabetes, eating whole fruits can help control your blood sugar.
It's time to bust this myth, said Dr. Linda Shiue, an internist and the director of culinary medicine and lifestyle medicine at Kaiser Permanente San Francisco, adding that everyone -- including those with Type 2 diabetes -- can benefit from the health-promoting nutrients in fruit like fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.
Myth No. 5: Plant milk is healthier than dairy milk.
There's a perception that plant-based milks, such as those made from oats, almonds, rice and hemp, are more nutritious than cow's milk. "It's just not true," said Kathleen Merrigan, a professor of sustainable food systems at Arizona State University and a former U.S. deputy secretary of agriculture. Consider protein: Typically, cow's milk has about eight grams of protein per cup, whereas almond milk typically has around one or two grams per cup, and oat milk usually has around two or three grams per cup. While the nutrition of plant-based beverages can vary, Dr. Merrigan said, many have more added ingredients -- like sodium and added sugars, which can contribute to poor health -- than cow's milk.
Myth No. 6: White potatoes are bad for you.
Potatoes have often been vilified in the nutrition community because of their high glycemic index -- which means they contain rapidly digestible carbohydrates that can spike your blood sugar. However, potatoes can actually be beneficial for health, said Daphene Altema-Johnson, a program officer of food communities and public health at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future. They are rich in vitamin C, potassium, fiber and other nutrients, especially when consumed with the skin. They are also inexpensive and found year-round in grocery stores, making them more accessible. Healthier preparation methods include roasting, baking, boiling and air frying.
Myth No. 7: You should never feed peanut products to your children within their first few years of life.
For years, experts told new parents that the best way to prevent their children from developing food allergies was to avoid feeding them common allergenic foods, like peanuts or eggs, during their first few years of life. But now, allergy experts say, it's better to introduce peanut products to your child early on.
If your baby does not have severe eczema or a known food allergy, you can start introducing peanut products (such as watered-down peanut butter, peanut puffs or peanut powders, but not whole peanuts) at around 4 to 6 months, when your baby is ready for solids. Start with two teaspoons of smooth peanut butter mixed with water, breast milk or formula, two to three times a week, said Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a professor of pediatrics and the director of the Center for Food Allergy & Asthma Research at the Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine. If your baby has severe eczema, first ask your pediatrician or an allergist about starting peanut products around 4 months. "It is also important to feed your baby a diverse diet in their first year of life to prevent food allergies," Dr. Gupta said.
Myth No. 8: The protein in plants is incomplete.
"'Where do you get your protein?' is the No. 1 question vegetarians get asked," said Christopher Gardner, a nutrition scientist and professor of medicine at Stanford University. "The myth is that plants are completely missing some amino acids," also known as the building blocks of proteins, he said. But in reality, all plant-based foods contain all 20 amino acids, including all nine essential amino acids, Dr. Gardner said; the difference is that the proportion of these amino acids isn't as ideal as the proportion of amino acids in animal-based foods. So, to get an adequate mix, you simply need to eat a variety of plant-based foods throughout the day -- such as beans, grains and nuts -- and eat enough total protein. Luckily, most Americans get more than enough protein each day. "It's easier than most people think," Dr. Gardner said.
Myth No. 9: Eating soy-based foods can increase the risk of breast cancer.
High doses of plant estrogens in soy called isoflavones have been found to stimulate breast tumor cell growth in animal studies. "However, this relationship has not been substantiated in human studies," said Dr. Frank B. Hu, a professor and the chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. So far, the science does not indicate a link between soy intake and breast cancer risk in humans. Instead, consuming soy-based foods and drinks -- like tofu, tempeh, edamame, miso and soy milk -- may even have a protective effect toward breast cancer risk and survival. "Soy foods are also a powerhouse of beneficial nutrients related to reduced heart disease risk, such as high-quality protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals," Dr. Hu said. The research is clear: Feel confident incorporating soy foods into your diet.
Myth No. 10: Fundamental nutrition advice keeps changing -- a lot.
This is not the case, said Dr. Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. "In the 1950s, the first dietary recommendations for prevention of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and the like advised balancing calories and minimizing foods high in saturated fat, salt and sugar. The current U.S. Dietary Guidelines urge the same." Yes, science evolves, but the bottom-line dietary guidance remains consistent. As author Michael Pollan distilled to seven simple words: "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." That advice worked 70 years ago, and it still does today, Dr. Nestle said. And it leaves plenty of room for eating foods you love.

Are Protein Bars Any Good for You?: [Science Desk]

Full text: Or are they just glorified candy bars?
In the late 1980s, two distance runners who were living together in the Bay Area blended vitamins, oat bran, milk protein and corn syrup in their kitchen, concocting what would become a PowerBar, one of the first modern protein bars. By the mid 1990s, it was a phenomenon -- what one writer for The New York Times called "a high octane snack for yuppies and fitness freaks."
Today, though, protein bars are everywhere, and their branding has expanded far beyond exercise fanatics. They're presented as healthy snacks for when you're on the go or even as part of a self-care routine. Grocery stores, gas stations, bodegas, gyms and pharmacies now carry colorfully wrapped hunks of whey protein, marketed as energy-supplying health foods, despite coming in flavors like cookie dough and lemon cake. The global market for protein bars is growing quickly and expected to swell to more than $ 2 billion by the end of 2026, according to the financial analysis site, MarketWatch.
"We've just gone completely off the rails with protein in recent years," said Hannah Cutting-Jones, a food historian and director of the food studies program at the University of Oregon.
Manufacturers of these products would have you believe that they can improve your health and your workout. The website for Clif Bar shows people hurling kettlebells or racing through the rain; Gatorade describes its protein bar as "scientifically designed for athletes." Others seem to brand themselves under the squishy umbrella of wellness. Their marketing features photos and videos of serene women writing in journals, with tips for preventing burnout on the side.
Despite the advertising, though, nutrition experts say that protein bars aren't all that healthy.
"You can put 'keto' or 'protein' on a candy bar and sell it, and people don't even question it," said Janet Chrzan, an adjunct assistant professor of nutritional anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Protein is an important part of our diet.
There's no question that our bodies need protein for building, maintaining and repairing muscles, said Anthony DiMarino, a registered dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic's Center for Human Nutrition. Protein also makes up our hair, skin, nails and organs; and the amino acids in proteins help our brains function. Perhaps because of that, protein stands alone in the world of wellness. Over the last 40 years, fad diets that vilify sugars, fats and carbs have come in and out of fashion. But many of the most popular diets, past and current, prioritize protein, associating it with weight loss, Dr. Chrzan said. "We value protein so much that it's the central thing on our plate," she said.
People also instinctively associate protein with fitness, said Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. When they eat protein bars, "people think they're doing something good for their health," she said.
You'd be hard-pressed to find an American who actually needs more protein, though, said Eric Rimm, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most meat eaters get far more than the recommended daily dose of protein (which is about 0.4 grams per pound of body weight). And those who don't eat meat can get enough protein from plant sources like tofu, nuts and legumes.
Are protein bars health foods?
Protein is likely to fill you up more than simple carbs will, Dr. Rimm said. That may be because protein helps our bodies release hormones that keep hunger at bay.
But many protein bars are also full of sugar. A chocolate chip Clif Bar, for example, contains 16 grams of added sugars, more than what's in a serving of Thin Mints. A Gatorade protein bar in the flavor chocolate chip contains 28 grams of added sugars, twice the amount in a Dunkin' Donuts chocolate frosted doughnut with sprinkles.
"By and large, they're highly processed, high in sugar and salt -- kind of a 'Frankenfood,"' Dr. Cutting-Jones said. Dr. Rimm agreed: Many protein bars are really just "candy bars with a lot more protein," he said.
Protein bars might make sense for someone who needs to increase their protein intake -- for example, a vegan who doesn't get enough protein from their diet, or someone who just had an intense workout, Mr. DiMarino said. But for the average person, adding another punch of protein into your diet -- particularly when it comes with a lot of added sugar -- is not going to make you healthier.
"It's a snack for when you're in a pinch," said Stephanie Urrutia, director of performance nutrition at the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics at the University of California, Los Angeles, such as "if you're going up the side of the mountain, if you can't grab a full meal." But it's not meant to be an actual replacement for a meal, she said.
Some bars are worse than others.
Not all protein bars are created equal in terms of their ingredients and nutritional content. If you do want to reach for a protein bar, pay attention to the nutrition facts label. Opt for those with ingredients that you recognize, Dr. Nestle said. "If they're largely nuts and fruit -- that's not bad," she said.
If you're having a protein bar as a snack or post-workout supplement, aim for a one that has roughly 200 calories per serving, Mr. DiMarino said, with fewer than five grams of fat and five grams of added sugar. And the amount of protein it contains can vary from bar to bar, but he said you might want to aim for one with 15 to 20 grams per serving.
You also might consider opting for a different snack that's just as portable and nutritious, Dr. Rimm said, like grapes, a banana, an apple or yogurt with berries. Dr. Nestle suggested a handful of nuts and Mr. DiMarino recommended tuna or hard-boiled eggs, which are high in protein but not processed. But you likely don't need to stress about ensuring you're meeting, or exceeding, your daily protein allotment.
"People just need to relax about protein intake," Dr. Cutting-Jones said.

Full text: Sandra Brooke and David Gordon became each other's source of support after their spouses died.
It was Sandra Ludig Brooke's first wedding anniversary without her husband of 33 years, who had died in 2019 after more than a decade of health setbacks. That same day, March 1, 2020, her friends Maggi McCormick Gordon and David Sorrell Gordon were hosting a party in Los Angeles to celebrate their own 46th wedding anniversary. Ms. Brooke debated whether to attend.
"I went, there was this lovely party and of course I cried all the way home," she said.
The following year, in February 2021, Ms. Gordon was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer and eventually died, on June 6. At the end of a celebration of her life a few weeks later, Ms. Brooke was saying goodbye to Mr. Gordon and the two of them suggested meeting up to talk about losing a beloved partner.
"We thought it would be a nice, companionable lunch and it turned out to be quite a searing conversation about death and loss," Ms. Brooke said.

Ms. Brooke, 65, is the Avery director of the library at the Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens, in San Marino, Calif. She has a bachelor's degree in the history of art from Northwestern University, a master's degree in the history of art from Williams College, and a master's degree in library science from SUNY Albany. Mr. Gordon, 81, is the president of the Sierra Madre Playhouse and has a bachelor's degree in politics, philosophy and economics from the University of Oxford.
That August, Mr. Gordon invited himself over to Ms. Brooke's home in Pasadena, Calif., for English tea. Mr. Gordon is English, the same nationality as her late husband, David Brooke, and Mr. Gordon figured Ms. Brooke would be versed in the matter. (She was.)
At the end of that summer, Mr. Gordon asked Ms. Brooke to dinner and a movie. But when she saw the email invitation, she replied that she was busy with a work event that night.
"It was a complete lie," Ms. Brooke said. "But I instantly had this regret." Then Mr. Gordon, taking her at her word, suggested a different night. "I took a big gulp and said sure," she said.
They began spending more time together. In January 2022, they stayed in a hotel in the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in San Diego County, Calif. While hiking into a slot canyon, they got a bit turned around. "It was getting lost and then getting un-lost and laughing," Ms. Brooke said, "when I thought maybe this really is something. Maybe we're going to be a good partnership."
Mr. Gordon was also considering the future. "It became clear that there was another fork in the road," he said. The question was to go on "half living together" or taking the leap into a deeper level of commitment.
On July 2, 2022, Mr. Gordon asked Ms. Brooke to marry him. "I think he was surprised he asked and surprised I said yes," she said. ‌
"If you've had a happy marriage," Mr. Gordon said, "and you lose your partner, the loss is of that person, but it's also of being a couple, being part of a living love and I felt it very, very keenly. The example of Maggi looking at life full in the face and knowing what would happen led me to value life more highly."
"We both know that you only have today," Ms. Brooke said. "I think that made us both want to live life more ferociously."
Soon after, the couple walked into a jewelry store and picked out an engagement ring. Mr. Gordon walked into a tailor's and asked for a suit in "The Economist's red," a color he'd been drawn to ever since he was a journalist for -- and then the chief executive of -- the publication with an iconic red logo. Ms. Brooke, who will be taking her husband's name and living with him in Sierra Madre, Calif., chose a white pantsuit and red pumps.
On Jan. 3, the Rev. Kay Lynn Northcutt, a minister for the Disciples of Christ church and Ms. Brooke's friend since they were teenagers, officiated a secular ceremony in the courtyard at Sparrows Lodge, a hotel in Palm Springs, Calif.
She offered a moment to remember loved ones not present. During the reception, also in the courtyard, the couple toasted to their former spouses. Children and grandchildren from both sides "got along like a house on fire," Ms. Brooke said, calling themselves the Grookes and the Bordons and dancing all night. "The young people really pulled us along in their wake."

Danone Sued Over Its Plastic Use Under a Landmark Law: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Environmental groups are relying on a law in France requiring large companies to address their environmental footprint.
PARIS -- Danone, the French dairy giant, is being taken to court by three environmental groups who say it has failed to reduce its plastic footprint sufficiently, in a lawsuit challenging corporate social responsibility in the face of the climate crisis.
The groups accuse Danone -- one of the world's top 10 plastic polluters, according to a recent study -- of "failing to live up to its duties" under a groundbreaking French law that requires large companies to address their environmental impact and has opened ways to sue them should they fail to do so.
"Danone is trudging ahead without a serious plan to deal with plastics, despite clear concern from climate and health experts and consumers, and a legal obligation to face up to the issue," Rosa Pritchard, a lawyer for ClientEarth, one of the groups, said in a statement on Monday.
A spokeswoman for Danone said the company "strongly" refutes the accusation, adding that it was taking action to "reduce the use of plastic, develop reuse, reinforce collection and recycling channels, and develop alternative materials."
The lawsuit is likely to put the spotlight on the explosive growth of plastics pollution, which scientists say is affecting air and water quality, global warming, as well as human and animal life. The issue is so pressing that the United Nations last year agreed to begin writing a treaty designed to curb plastics production.
But Monday's announcement also spoke to a broader trend in environmental activism, with advocacy groups increasingly suing governments and companies in an effort to bridge the gap between their climate promises and their actual record.
Adam Weiss, ClientEarth program director for Europe, said some could see France's statute as toothless because of its vague requirements.
But, he added, "the teeth are in the lawsuits."
By suing Danone, ClientEarth and the two other groups, Surfrider Europe and Zero Waste France, are hoping to shed light on what many scientists say is a global plastic crisis whose potentially devastating effects have yet to be fully understood.
Throughout their life cycle, plastics, which are manufactured from fossil fuels, release air pollutants, harm human health and kill marine life. In 2015, they were responsible for 4.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, one recent study found, more than all of the world's airplanes combined.
Figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show that, over the past seven decades, plastics production has soared from two million metric tons (there are about 2,200 pounds per metric ton) to more than 400 million -- and is expected to almost triple by 2060.
Danone alone used more than 750,000 metric tons of plastic -- about 74 times the weight of the Eiffel Tower -- in water bottles , yogurt containers and other packaging in 2021, according to its 2021 financial report.
The company said that it reduced its plastic consumption by 12 percent from 2018 to 2021, and that it has committed to use only reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025. But Danone is not on track to reach that target, according to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which set up a voluntary program with the United Nations for big companies to address plastic pollution.
An investigation last year by the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle also highlighted Danone's shortcomings when it comes to recycled plastics.
Environmental groups also say that recycling has not proved effective at the scale necessary: Only 9 percent of all plastics ever made have been recycled, according to the United Nations, with most of the rest ending up in landfills and dumps.
"We're not going to recycle our way out of this," Mr. Weiss of ClientEarth said.
He added that plastics were too critical to Danone's business model for "voluntary mechanisms" to be effective. "We need the power of law," he said.
To sue Danone, the environmental groups have relied on the so-called duty of vigilance law, a groundbreaking piece of legislation that France passed in 2017. It requires large companies to take effective measures to identify and prevent human rights violations and environmental damages throughout their chain of activity.
Impetus for the law came from the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013, in which the collapse of a clothing factory killed more than 1,100 people in Bangladesh. Labels from famous brands were found in the rubble, casting a harsh light on the garment industry and prompting politicians and rights groups around the world to press for more corporate responsibility.
The French duty of vigilance law, the first of its kind in Europe, has since inspired similar legislation in Germany and the Netherlands, as well as a proposed European Union directive.
There is nothing like a duty of vigilance law in the United States. The Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act, which would require plastic producers to finance waste and recycling programs, and ban single-use plastic bags and the exporting of plastic waste to developing countries, is currently in committee.
However, environmental organizations have increasingly sued big plastic polluters like Coca-Cola over the past few years using mostly state-level consumer protection laws, alleging that the companies' use of single-use plastic contradicts advertising statements that they are committed to recycling and the environment.
In France, academics and rights groups say, many companies have responded to the law only by listing vague measures or some that already existed before the new obligations.
"It's often about streamlining existing practices," said Pauline Barraud de Lagerie, a sociologist at University Paris Dauphine who published a book on corporate responsibility. She added that by suing companies, "N.G.O.s are trying to somehow bring back an obligation of result."
So far, around 15 legal cases based on the French law have been reported. Half of them have gone to court and are still awaiting judgment, which could take years.
"We're making up for the government's lack of political will," said Sandra Cossart, the head of Sherpa, a group involved in four legal cases, pointing to what she described as a law lacking teeth.
The environmental groups said in their statement that Danone's 2021 vigilance plan "is completely silent on plastics." They are calling for judges in a Paris civil court to force the company to release a new plan within six months that would include a phaseout of plastics. Should the company fail to meet that deadline, they are demanding damages of 100,000 euros ( $ 108,000) per day of delay.
In September, the groups had issued formal notices to eight other major food companies accusing them of inadequate due diligence plans. ClientEarth said it had received satisfactory responses from companies such as the grocery chain Carrefour and Nestlé, which promised to step up their efforts, but not from Danone.
The lawsuit is part of a wider trend of climate litigation that has gained momentum in recent years, expanding the climate fight beyond traditional demonstrations and civil disobedience initiatives.
The number of climate change lawsuits globally has more than doubled from 2017 to 2022, from about 900 to more than 2,000 ongoing or concluded cases, according to data from the Grantham Research Institute and the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.
Catherine Higham, a researcher at the Grantham institute, said that most cases have been brought against governments, but that increasingly advocacy groups have turned their sights on corporations.
Mr. Weiss of ClientEarth said his group had been struggling to navigate corporate laws "designed to protect investors and companies" in order to press them to better address environmental issues.
"Now, we have a law designed to make companies take action for the environment," he said. "That's a step change."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Dr. Femi Kuti and Dr. Ugochi Nwosu met in the Bay Area but soon entered a relationship that stretched from Lagos, Nigeria, to the United States.
Dr. Oluwafemi Akinwale Kuti Jr. was only visiting California for a few months -- but what he found was a long-term love.
It was February 2017, and Dr. Kuti, a general practitioner and entrepreneur, was participating in a start-up program for Reliance Health, a health care company he had co-founded the year before in Lagos, Nigeria, where he lived.
During this time, Dr. Kuti, who goes by Femi (and shares a name, though not a relation, with the famed Nigerian Afrobeat musician) signed up for Tinder. Which is where he came across a profile for Dr. Ugochi May Nwosu.
"I thought she was cute, and I reasoned she'd be smart since she went to Harvard," he said.
"She was also Nigerian, and there weren't too many in the Bay Area."
Dr. Nwosu, 34, had immigrated to the United States with her family when she was seven years old. On Tinder, "I saw that we had mutual friends," she said, which drew her in.
Their affinity for each other grew as they texted and talked over the phone.
"We had a lot of common interests around health care, around traveling, around politics," said Dr. Kuti, 37.
The couple couldn't meet face to face for about two weeks due Dr. Nwosu's all-consuming cardiology rotation at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center.
But on March 1, the day after her rotation ended, they met for the first time for dinner at Bissap Baobab, a Senegalese restaurant in San Francisco.
"I think there was a spark from the beginning," Dr. Nwosu said of the date, which ended with what she jokingly dubbed a "stolen" kiss. They would have arranged for another date soon after, but Dr. Nwosu had planned a trip to Las Vegas with fellow residents. Afterward, she was set to visit her family in Piscataway, N.J.
"But we were texting each other consistently," Dr. Kuti said.
Dr. Nwosu said, "I was really looking forward to getting back to San Francisco to go on our second date" -- which ended up being, in a perhaps subliminal nod to Cupid, an archery lesson. Afterward they saw the film "Get Out."
From then on, they saw each other as regularly as her busy hospital schedule allowed, every other day or so, and usually in snippets.
"He would come and meet me around dinner time and bring me meals from nice restaurants as a way to make me calm when I was doing overnight call in the I.C.U.," Dr. Nwosu said.
"I'm a little bit more prone to getting anxious," she added. "I very quickly felt that I could depend on him -- that he would sort of be my rock."
At the time, Dr. Kuti was staying in Mountain View, Calif., and Dr. Nwosu lived and worked in San Francisco, roughly a 50-minute drive away. Dr. Kuti said, "I now know it was a bit of a schlep." But due to his growing affection, he added, "it didn't feel like a schlep at all."
A turning point in their relationship came that April during a day trip to Point Reyes National Seashore, a U.S. national park about an hour's drive north of San Francisco.
They rented a car, stopped at the Devil's Teeth Baking Company in San Francisco for breakfast sandwiches, then headed to the park. On the way, Dr. Kuti plugged his phone into the car's stereo system and played a playlist of mainly '90s soft rock songs. But when the South African hit "Pluto (Remember You)" by DJ Clock and the group Beatenberg came on, the couple spontaneously began singing along together.
They both agreed that the song became the soundtrack of the trip.
Arriving at the park, the two began their hourslong trek taking in the fauna and flora of the area. There was lots of laughter and expanses of intense conversation, as well. They said they gained crucial insights into one another.
"I think we spent a lot of time talking about big things we could do that would leave our mark on the world," Dr. Kuti said.
"I didn't know if we both had that big mission in life," Dr. Nwosu said. "It was in that conversation I saw how similar we were in how we thought about the impact we wanted to make on the world. Hearing him talking about that in detail, I could really see myself with this person."
"Everything from the breakfast sandwiches, the playlist in the car, and the conversations during the hike felt just exactly somehow right," she added.
Dr. Nwosu received her bachelor's degree from Harvard and her medical degree from Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.
Dr. Kuti, who was born in Nigeria and raised there as well as in Portsmouth, England, received his medical training at Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.
In late May, about two months after their idyllic day trip, the couple faced a reckoning. The next month, Dr. Kuti would return to Nigeria. Over dinner at El Techo, a Latin American restaurant in San Francisco, they tried to sort out whether they had a future together.
"I think we were both kind of realizing that I'm going to be leaving. She's going to be staying. What are we going to do with this?" Dr. Kuti said, referring to their relationship.
"I've been in long-distance relationships before that didn't really work out," Dr. Nwosu added. "It just sort of loses its fizzle over time. So, I was concerned that whatever we were feeling then would sort of fizzle over time with the distance. With my busy schedule, I just didn't know if we'd be able to maintain it."
They thought about different options: One being to split up and wait until Dr. Nwosu finished her residency a year later, in June 2018.
After some soul searching, they decided to stay together long-distance, although both were "very wary" of the prospect.
The nine-hour time difference between San Francisco and Lagos, Nigeria, didn't help. Or perhaps it did.
"When I'm getting up, she's turning in, and when she's getting up, I'm turning in," Dr. Kuti said.
This seemed like a disadvantage at first, but they figured out a routine to get the most from the time difference.
"He would give me the first hour of his day and I would give him the last hour of mine," Dr. Nwosu said. "So it worked out."
There were also daily text messages and FaceTime conversations which might last a few minutes or hours depending on what circumstances permitted. And every two to three months, they would visit each other in person -- with Dr. Kuti traveling to San Francisco since he had a more flexible work schedule as the chief executive of his health care company, Reliance Health. Once she completed residency in internal medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, Dr. Nwosu visited Dr. Kuti's home turf.
"I was thinking about joining him in Nigeria," she said. "It was a good trip for me to see what my life would be like."
But they endured another year apart when she was accepted as an instructor in medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.
Over the years, Dr. Kuti had accompanied Dr. Nwosu several times to her parents' home in Piscataway. In June of 2021, however, the trip was different. He planned to ask Dr. Nwosu's father, Luke Nwosu, for his daughter's hand in marriage.
"I told him I deeply loved his daughter and wanted to marry her," Dr. Kuti said. "I wanted his permission and to know what rites I needed to put in place before doing so," he said, referring to the customs often required before proceeding with a marriage.
Mr. Nwosu told Dr. Kuti he would think about it.
"The next day, he shows up with a list of rites," said Dr. Kuti, "and then says he needs to meet my parents, even if virtually."
The rites began with the Igbo tradition of Iku Aka, or "knocking on the door," where the prospective bridegroom and older male members of his family call upon the prospective bride's family while bearing gifts -- usually food and drinks. And so this is what Dr. Kuti did in October 2021, using beer, champagne and a malt-flavored soft drink.
The tradition is "basically where the groom formalizes his intentions with the bride's family," Dr. Kuti said. "Ugochi and I had discussed this, and it was important to her that this step happened as a sign of respect to her parents."

In December 2021, he proposed in the Western tradition, on bended knee.
Dr. Kuti reconstructed the day four years earlier when they had gone hiking at Point Reyes. He rented a car and headed toward the park, buying a pair of breakfast sandwiches at Devil's Teeth Bakery along the way. When they arrived at the park to begin their hike, Dr. Nwosu figured something was up.
For one thing, she said, Dr. Kuti was overly concerned about timing. "Who gets anxious about arriving at a specific time and place during a hike?" she wondered. "Femi loves to plan a surprise so I was eager to see what he had in store for us."
Sure enough, when they arrived at a spot Dr. Kuti had predetermined, the photography team he had hired was there, to record Dr. Kuti's proposal and him presenting her with the engagement ring he codesigned with a jeweler.
Dr. Nwosu said of the ring, "I had no idea that he was designing it," she said. Without hesitation, she said, "Yes."
On Dec. 10, the couple had a civil marriage, officiated by Grace Odia, an official at the Federal Marriage Registry in Ikoyi, Nigeria.
On Dec. 28, they had a Christian ceremony at Crystal Lake Resort, Oguta, Imo State. A 31-member Catholic choir accompanied by traditional Igbo drums and other instruments performed during the ceremony. Dr. Adesegun Fatusi vice-chancellor of University of Medical Sciences, in Ondo, Nigeria and a former mentor to the bridegroom, officiated.
On Dec. 29, the couple had a third ceremony on the bride's family compound in the town of Aro-Ibiasoegbe, which included both Igbo and Yoruba traditions.
The couple now resides in Lagos.
Reflecting on the journey that brought her and Dr. Kuti to marriage, Dr. Nwosu, now a senior vice president of clinical services at Reliance Health, remembers a time in the spring of 2020, when she was in New York and Dr. Kuti was in Lagos. He was supposed to visit her in mid-March, but the pandemic upended those plans.
When they finally got together in August, she said, "Going back to long distance after being together made it clear that I wanted to be with him, wherever in the world that was."
On This Day
When: Dec. 29, 2022
Where: The bride's family compound in the town of Aro-Ibiasoegbe.
Blending Traditions: The African ceremony incorporated cultural aspects of Igbo and Yoruba traditions in tribute to the bride and groom's ethnic groups. During one part of the festivities, musicians played Yoruba talking drums, and a D.J. played contemporary and classic popular music sung in Igbo and Yoruba.
Overlapping Love: The bride's ring was designed by the bridegroom and Los Angeles-based jewelry designer, Maggi Simpkins. The two overlapping curves on the band represent love and unity in the African writing system called Nsibidi.
Three Dresses: At different parts of the ceremony, the bride wore dresses symbolizing the stages of her life: First, her "maiden" dress, which she accessorized with waist beads from her late grandmother. She wore a second outfit during her playful search for her husband among the crowd of well-wishers. Her final outfit was the one in which she made her first appearance as a married woman: formal attire in the Yoruba tradition (in deference to her husband's ethnic group), which matched his clothes, symbolizing their unity.
