Full text: The gaming industry spent billions pursuing the idea that customers wanted realistic graphics. Did executives misread the market?
One way to understand the video game industry's current crisis is by looking closely at Spider-Man's spandex.
For decades, companies like Sony and Microsoft have bet that realistic graphics were the key to attracting bigger audiences. By investing in technology, they have elevated flat pixelated worlds into experiences that often feel like stepping into a movie.
Designers of last year's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 used the processing power of the PlayStation 5 so Peter Parker's outfits would be rendered with realistic textures and skyscraper windows could reflect rays of sunlight.
That level of detail did not come cheap.
Insomniac Games, which is owned by Sony, spent about $ 300 million to develop Spider-Man 2, according to leaked documents, more than triple the budget of the first game in the series, which was released five years earlier. Chasing Hollywood realism requires Hollywood budgets, and even though Spider-Man 2 sold more than 11 million copies, several members of Insomniac lost their jobs when Sony announced 900 layoffs in February.
Cinematic games are getting so expensive and time-consuming to make that the video game industry has started to acknowledge that investing in graphics is providing diminished financial returns.
"It's very clear that high-fidelity visuals are only moving the needle for a vocal class of gamers in their 40s and 50s," said Jacob Navok, a former executive at Square Enix who left that studio, known for the Final Fantasy series, in 2016 to start his own media company. "But what does my 7-year-old son play? Minecraft. Roblox. Fortnite."
Joost van Dreunen, a market analyst and professor at New York University, said it was clear what younger generations value in their video games: "Playing is an excuse for hanging out with other people."
When millions are happy to play old games with outdated graphics -- including Roblox (2006), Minecraft (2009) and Fortnite (2017) -- it creates challenges for studios that make blockbuster single-player titles. The industry's audience has slightly shrunk for the first time in decades. Studios are rapidly closing and sweeping layoffs have affected more than 20,000 employees in the past two years, including more than 2,500 Microsoft workers.
Many video game developers built their careers during an era that glorified graphical fidelity. They marveled at a scene from The Last of Us: Part II in which Ellie, the protagonist, removes a shirt over her head to reveal bruises and scrapes on her back without any technical glitches.
But a few years later, costly graphical upgrades are often barely noticeable.
When the studio Naughty Dog released a remastered version of The Last of Us: Part II this year, light bounced off lakes and puddles with a more realistic shimmer. In a November ad for the PlayStation 5 Pro, an enhanced version of the Sony console that retails for almost $ 700, the billboards in Spider-Man 2's Manhattan featured crisper letters.
Optimizing cinematic games for a narrow group of consumers who have spent hundreds of dollars on a console or computer may no longer make financial sense. Studios are increasingly prioritizing games with basic graphics that can be played on the smartphones already in everyone's pocket.
"They essentially run on toasters," said Matthew Ball, an entrepreneur and video game analyst, talking about games like Roblox and League of Legends. "The developers aren't chasing graphics but the social connections that players have built over time."
Going Hollywood
Developers had long taught players to equate realism with excellence, but this new toaster generation of gamers is upsetting industry orthodoxies. The developer behind Animal Well, which received extensive praise this year, said the game's file size was smaller than many of the screenshots used to promote it.
A company like Nintendo was once the exception that proved the rule, telling its audiences over the past 40 years that graphics were not a priority.
That strategy had shown weaknesses through the 1990s and 2000s, when the Nintendo 64 and GameCube had weaker visuals and sold fewer copies than Sony consoles. But now the tables have turned. Industry figures joke about how a cartoony game like Luigi's Mansion 3 on the Nintendo Switch considerably outsells gorgeous cinematic narratives on the PlayStation 5 like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
There are a number of theories why gamers have turned their backs on realism. One hypothesis is that players got tired of seeing the same artistic style in major releases. Others speculate that cinematic graphics require so much time and money to develop that gameplay suffers, leaving customers with a hollow experience.
Another theory is that major studios have spent recent years reshaping themselves in Hollywood's image, pursuing crossover deals that have given audiences "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" and "The Last of Us" on HBO. Not only have companies like Ubisoft opened divisions to produce films, but their games include an astonishing amount of scenes where players watch the story unfold.
In 2007, the first Assassin's Creed provided more than 2.5 hours of footage for a fan edit of the game's narrative. As the series progressed, so did Ubisoft's taste for cinema. Like many studios, it increasingly leaned on motion-capture animators who could create scenes using human actors on soundstages. A fan edit of Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, which was released in 2020, lasted about 23 hours -- longer than two seasons of "Game of Thrones."
Gamers and journalists began talking about how the franchise's entries had gotten too bloated and expensive. Ubisoft developers advertised last year's Assassin's Creed Mirage, which had about five hours of cut scenes, as "more intimate."
The immersive graphics of virtual reality can also be prohibitive for gamers; the Meta Quest Pro sells for $ 1,000 and the Apple Vision Pro for $ 3,500. This year, the chief executive of Ubisoft, Yves Guillemot, told the company's investors that because the virtual reality version of Assassin's Creed did not meet sales expectations, the company was not increasing its investment in the technology.
Many studios have instead turned to the live service model, where graphics are less important than a regular drip of new content that keeps players engaged. Genshin Impact, by the studio Hoyoverse, makes roughly $ 2 billion every year on mobile platforms alone, according to the data tracker Sensor Tower.
Going Broke?
It was clear this year, however, that the live service strategy carries its own risks. Warner Bros. Discovery took a $ 200 million loss on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, according to Bloomberg. Sony closed the studio behind Concord, its attempt to compete with team-based shooters like Overwatch and Apex Legends, one month after the game released to a minuscule player base.
"We have a market that has been in growth mode for decades," Ball said. "Now we are in a mature market where instead of making bets on growth, companies need to try and steal shares from each other."
Some industry professionals believe there is a path for superb-looking games to survive the cost crunch.
"I used to be a high-fidelity guy; I would log into games and if it didn't look hyperrealistic, then it was not so interesting," said David Reitman, a managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers, where he leads the consulting firm's games division. "There was a race to hyperrealism, and it's tough to pivot away. You have set expectations."
Reitman sees a future where most of the heavy costs associated with cutting-edge graphics are handled by artificial intelligence. He said that manufacturers were working on creating A.I. chips for consoles that would facilitate those changes, and that some game studios were already using smart algorithms to improve graphics further than anything previously seen.
He expects that sports games will be the first genre to see considerable improvements because developers have access to hundreds of hours of game footage. "They can take feeds from leagues and transpose them into graphical renderings," Reitman said, "leveraging language models to generate the incremental movements and facial expressions of players."
Some independent developers are less convinced. "The idea that there will be content from A.I. before we figure out how it works and where it will source data from is really hard," said Rami Ismail, a game developer in the Netherlands.
Ismail is worried that major studios are in a tight spot where traditional games have become too expensive but live service games have become too risky. He pointed to recent games that had both jaw-dropping realism -- Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora (individual pebbles of gravel cast shadows) and Senua's Saga: Hellblade II (rays of sunlight flicker through the trees) -- and lackluster sales.
He recalled a question that emerged early in the coronavirus pandemic and has become something of an unofficial motto in the video game industry.
"How can we as an industry make shorter games with worse graphics made with people who are paid well to work less?" Ismail said.
"If we can, then there might be short-term hope," he continued. "Otherwise I think the slow strangulation of the games industry is ongoing."

Movies, Memes, Habits and Hobbies That Took Us Far, Far Away In 2024: [Sunday Review Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/movies-memes-habits-hobbies-that-took-us-far-away/docview/3149804147/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Endless wars, expensive groceries, extreme weather -- those are just some of the issues in the E section of our index of things we'd prefer to have skipped in 2024. So we asked Times Opinion staff members to share how they escaped it all this year. These are the habits we started, the ones we quit, the culture that brought comfort and the memes that made us laugh so hard that we momentarily achieved a state of Zen. This is what we'll carry with us as we turn the page to 2025.
Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out Phone a Friend My oldest friend and I do synchronized viewing of each new episode of the show "Shrinking" (which follows a rogue therapist and his patients) and text commentary and our fave quotes back and forth. We definitely want our own Derek. (IYKYK.) Michelle Cottle, writer Setting Sail In the dark months of the sailing off-season, I get my fix from the Sampson Boat Co. YouTube series. It follows a shipwright and sailor, Leo Goolden, as he rebuilds a historic wooden gaff cutter designed by the renowned yacht designer Albert Strange. From the bowsprit to the capstan, every detail of the boat is lovingly made and joyfully documented. This year the team finally launched the boat, and watching it sail in all its glory has been a true joy. Quoctrung Bui, graphics editor LOLs for Days The streaming service Dropout, formerly known as CollegeHumor, offers delightfully smart, unscripted comedy and is my go-to when I need a laugh. Taylor Maggiacomo, graphics editor Gotta Catch 'Em All I get my dose of peace by watching the Netflix show "Pokémon Concierge" while playing Pokémon on my Nintendo Switch. The double distraction blocks any thought from entering your head, and the low-stakes, low-conflict world of cute little guys provides a needed infusion of bliss. Valerie Pavilonis, editorial assistant Oui, Oui "L'Agence," or "The Parisian Agency," is a Netflix reality show about a family-run, highend real estate agency at the edge of Paris. It refreshes my French slang, the B-roll boasts endless views of Paris, and it allows a voyeuristic look into apartments and homes worth millions of euros. Sarah Wildman, writer and editor What Goes Around Comes Around JoJo Siwa's single "Karma" signaled her queer reinvention, from a ponytailed princess into something resembling a Gene Simmonsified K.D. Lang, but Ms. Siwa's new persona provoked relentless, unfair bullying from critics and, well, the entire internet. If you can get past her Kidz Bop-style sound, her naïve campiness perfectly embodies L.G.B.T.Q. culture. This year I found comfort in her transformation's implicit story: There's a greater future ahead if you shamelessly claim it for yourself. Anna Marks, editor Scratch and Sniff I love perfumes, but when I'm on Fragrantica -- the online home of aroma lovers -- I have little interest in smelling or purchasing most of what I'm reading about. The pleasure comes entirely from reading attempt after attempt at accomplishing the impossible: conveying scent through words alone. Meher Ahmad, editor Fact or Fiction The novel "All Fours" by Miranda July was the most revelatory, exciting book I read this year. Eliza Barclay, climate editor Night-Night at the Museum If my mind is too busy to sleep at night, I turn on the Met's YouTube art lectures -- the longer, the better. The videos' tone is soothing, and the content helps me connect with something beautiful and interesting from another time or place. Once my mind is immersed in, say, Greek vase paintings, I'm out like a light. Jessia Ma, deputy editor of design Checkmate I'm still a pretty terrible player, but spending 30 minutes playing virtual chess with a stranger on a chess app makes for a better commute than yet another half-hour wasted on Instagram. Emily Holzknecht, video producer Wake and Bake This year, as ever, I found distraction and refuge in the stalwart comforts of "The Great British Baking Show." It won't be lost on future cultural historians that a decade of unceasing global tumult coincided with the sturdy popularity of a TV series about a bunch of collegial normies in a tent in the English countryside, seemingly far from society, being nice to one another and baking pies. Adam Sternbergh, culture editor Record Scratch Amid the slop of artificial intelligence, there are diamonds: deepfake audio recordings of presidents singing karaoke. Donald Trump croons. Joe Biden joins in on a second verse. Frank Sinatra and Queen. Mariachi and musicals. The Carpenters -- Karen and Richard and Sabrina. For just a moment in the algorithmic feed, politics is harmonious. Rollin Hu, researcher Rom-Com Binge Given the scale of violence in Gaza and the fallout from it in the United States, it's a weird time for "Nobody Wants This," the Netflix series about a blond shiksa podcaster (Kristen Bell) who falls in love with a rabbi (Adam Brody). I kept waiting for the series to grapple with the issues in Israel and Gaza, but the moment never arrived. Maybe that's part of the charm: The series is a fantasy about how true love can transform us. Farah Stockman, editorial board member Learn a Little Something Bonjour, Duo I have a 1,726-day (and counting) streak on Duolingo French -- screen time I don't have to feel bad about. Lauren Leibowitz, editor Go for Gold I can't stop rewatching clips of Novak Djokovic winning his first Olympic gold medal after chasing one for over a decade. I don't know much about tennis or Mr. Djokovic, but I don't need to. The joy that he radiates as he collapses onto the court in tears and then bounds through the crowd to see his family transports me every time. Glyn Fox, editor Perception Deception I love everything Alfonso Cuarón does, and that's held true for his Apple TV+ series "Disclaimer." On the surface, it seems like a soapy tale of infidelity and betrayal, but it's actually a deeper, "Rashomon"-like examination of how our biases shape the way we interpret events and then create stories out of them. It's the kind of show you immediately want to rewatch when it's done. Pamela Paul, columnist Our Lips Are Sealed I loved "Say Nothing," the streaming series based on Patrick Radden Keefe's book about the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Both actresses who play the I.R.A. bomber Dolours Price -- young and older -- are amazing. Maureen Dowd, columnist Pelican State Politics "The Ritz of the Bayou" by Nancy Lemann is a hallucinatory, gin-soaked account of the racketeering trials of the former Louisiana governor Edwin Edwards. Parker Richards, staff editor Olde English The novels of Anthony Trollope pulled me away into a tranquil setting in the 19th-century English countryside populated by squires, churchmen and minor nobility. The milieu is rarefied and the language gentle, but the matters are serious: ambition, arrogance, resentment, love. Trollope has a charming habit of finding the positive in his most odious characters, and there is something calming about how he injects his authorial voice into the narrative, like a confiding friend. Dan Wakin, international editor La Dolce Vita The novel "Last Summer in the City" by Gianfranco Calligarich is a master class in dissociation. Avoidant lovers, alcoholic friends, an uncertain career in journalism -- this book has it all. Frank Augugliaro, design director Escapist Dark Humor The books of David Rakoff, particularly "Half Empty." Hyperarticulate, hilarious and eerily prescient. Leissa Jackmauh, administrative manager Enter the Void When I checked out Doug Wheeler's latest exhibition, "Day Night Day," at the David Zwirner gallery, I walked into an empty, glowing, immaculately white room. I kept my eyes trained forward, and the light seemed to radiate through the space, which has no corners or edges. As I walked in, my depth perception became warped, and I lost my sense of spatial awareness. I raised my arms, afraid I might run into something or perhaps fall off the edge. I'd like to keep that sense of wonder and timid delight as I move forward into the unknown of the next year. Jessie Wender, photo editorConcerning the UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois' I worried that "Illinoise," the musical based on the 2005 Sufjan Stevens album "Illinois," was just a ploy to make money off millennial nostalgia. But "Illinoise" was just so well done -- infusing new and bold artistry into a stream of songs. Though the music was familiar, I responded to it in an entirely new way. Neel Patel, health and science editor Quitting Things It's Giving '90s I've been ditching my smartphone every Saturday in a ritual I've dubbed No-Scroll Saturday. Want to listen to music? Put on a record. Read the news or cook dinner? Grab a newspaper or a cookbook. I do allow myself to call my mom or look up directions. The one sacrosanct rule: Don't scroll. Alexander Stockton, video journalist Home Envy I found a level of peace and serenity I didn't know I was missing when I finally kicked my habit of browsing property websites for fancy houses I had no intention (or means) to buy. George Pierpoint, audience editor Piano Over Podcasts I've started listening to classical music in the morning instead of jumping immediately into news podcasts the way I once did. It creates a peaceful, slightly romantic way to start the day. Cornelia Channing, editorial assistant Hard to Zip In 2024 I accepted that I am an overpacker. Small bags just do not work for me. I need space for my portable bidet, mini prayer mat, four lip glosses, dental hygiene supplies, a snack, hand creams, sticky notes, phone wipes and much, much more. Hibaq Farah, audience editor Don't Ask Me To combat the feeling of being overwhelmed that comes with endless daily decisions, I outsourced some by asking friends for recommendations and following them. I've added music to my playlists, purchased art, tried (and fell in love with) oysters and added healthy habits to my routine. Saying yes to their suggestions has made my life richer. Alexandra March, audience director Go Touch Grass After a year of nonstop news, the fields and forested trails that weave through Rock Creek Park in Washington have become the perfect reprieve from the endless notifications and stress of everyday life. Andrew Trunsky, editorial assistant The Things We Started Impromptu Hangs Like those of many middle-aged people, my schedule is both packed and unpredictable. I used to think the best way to see friends was making explicit time for them days or weeks in advance. But inevitably, something gets in the way -- a sick kid, an extra work deadline -- and that long-awaited hang gets canceled. I have had way more luck randomly texting my local pals with an hour's notice. Jessica Grose, writer One Stitch at a Time Needlepoint instantly clears my mind of any worry beyond where I am going to stitch next. The more detailed and fussy the design, the more I enjoy it. Suein Hwang, business editor Water Into Wine During these difficult days, it's wonderfully distracting to tend the cider apples and wine grapes on our family farm. In my day job, I shout at the world, and it pays no attention; on the farm, the grapes obediently turn into fine pinot noir. It is refreshing to duck from a world whose problems seem overwhelming and find my own nook with problems that are solvable -- and when solved can be celebrated with a glass of pinot. Nicholas Kristof, columnist Do You Hear the People Sing? One-day choirs assembled by the Gaia Music Collective bring together hundreds of people to learn and perform arrangements in just a few hours. You don't need singing experience to participate. Making harmonies with strangers is a welcome reprieve from our self-involved culture. Madi Winfield, audience editorial assistant Motorcycle Diaries This year, I bought a Triumph Bonneville and keep it in southern Indiana, where I regularly spend time. Riding country roads and rolling hills led me to conversations I never would have had otherwise -- with the burly Harley rider by the lake, the couple at the gas station or the young girl who also always dreamed of having a bike of her own. Kristen Cruzata, chief of staff Dewey Decimal Growing up, I moved around a few times. In each new place, my mom would get both of us cards at the local library. As an adult, I've rekindled my love for libraries, but it's more than just books. It's one of the last places you can enrich your life for free. Daniela Cobos, editorial fellow Pick a Card, Any Card Every morning, I choose a card from Oblique Strategies, a card set created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt in 1975 to help break creative blocks. Prompts range from "Use an old idea" to questions like "What would your closest friend do?" and occasionally surreal statements like "In total darkness, or in a very large room, very quietly." Jacqueline Bates, photography director Dewey Decimal Growing up, I moved around a few times. In each new place, my mom would get both of us cards at the local library. As an adult, I've rekindled my love for libraries, but it's more than just books. It's one of the last places you can enrich your life for free. Daniela Cobos, editorial fellow Pick a Card, Any Card Every morning, I choose a card from Oblique Strategies, a card set created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt in 1975 to help break creative blocks. Prompts range from "Use an old idea" to questions like "What would your closest friend do?" and occasionally surreal statements like "In total darkness, or in a very large room, very quietly." Jacqueline Bates, photography director Shred the Gnar When I began kite surfing, I questioned why anyone would ever do something so difficult. It felt like taking a geometry and anemology course and simultaneously doing cardio and a functional body workout, all while calling on muscle memory. And yet when it all connects, I'm flying on autopilot on the water. You suddenly feel you can do anything in life. Adam Ellick, head of video Remembrance of Things Read I don't have a great memory, and I often forget the content of a book once I finish it. I've started writing down quotes and leaving them in books while reading. I keep a shelf of my favorite books, with handwritten notes sprouting from them. When I pluck the bookmarks and read the quotes, I get instant access to the feeling I had reading them. Efim Shapiro, audio engineer Good Sport Wednesday is mahjong day: Each week, I'm either teaching someone about the complex game or learning as I lose to someone better than I am. Either way, I become a more strategic player. Sonia Herrero, audio engineer You Are Getting Very Sleepy I have learned to relax the tiny muscles around my eyes. I visualize the muscles and gently tell them to let go, one by one. They do! And then I feel a deep calm. It's a great way to go back to sleep at night. Peter Coy, writer Eating Our Feelings Spoonful of Sugar Putting sugar in my coffee. Austerity is out. Smallness and sweetness -- a teaspoon of turbinado -- is in. Mary Marge Locker, editor Pass the Presidential Casserole Cooking through Dwight Eisenhower's personal cookbook is not for the faint of heart -- my guests are still recovering from the cavernous melon stuffed with Jell-O and grapes. But what started as a culinary curiosity has brought me immense joy and become a delightful way to bring friends together. Kiana Cole, video producer Shaken, Not Stirred Fresh watermelon juice, gin, Lillet rosé, a highball glass. I don't know what else there is to say. Krista Mahr, international editor Medium-Rare Technically I can't blame a cookbook for my 15-point increase in LDL cholesterol, but the recipes of Cook's "Meat Illustrated" probably have something to do with it. Raina Raskin, editorial assistant Lessons From the Past 'Gatsby' Times Three "The Great Gatsby" left me cold when I read it in high school, but "Gatz," the Elevator Repair Service's seven-hour stage adaptation of the novel, is -- like the rich -- different. I've seen "Gatz" three times, and on every viewing, I've been absorbed by F. Scott Fitzgerald's examination of Americans' conflicted attitudes toward wealth and the elite, a conflict on vivid display in this year's election. Carmel McCoubrey, editor Once Upon a Time in America Over the summer I found a copy of J. Anthony Lukas's "Common Ground: A Turbulent Decade in the Lives of Three American Families" in a little free library. It's an immersive masterpiece in nonfiction that helps make sense of life today, even though it was published 40 years ago. Jillian Weinberger, audio producer Pacific Time When the workday is over and I'm not ready to tackle adulting, I head to a pier near my San Francisco home. From this windy, run-down spot, you can wedge in between the fishermen catching crabs and sardines to glimpse the sunset and migrating whales. Then, cold and refreshed, I head home wishing I knew how to catch dinner. Joanna Pearlstein, print editor Everyday Ecstasy Simon Critchley's new book, "Mysticism," has been on my night table for months. He is the rare philosopher who doesn't flinch at religious experience. And this book does something miraculous: It saves the baby of mysticism from the discarded bathwater of institutional religion. It reminds us that our attention matters, that even in our fractured digital age, ecstasy is possible. That's not religious hokum. It's practical, and most of us need reminders of it every day. Peter Catapano, editor Autocrats of Yore "The Oppermanns," a novel written in 1933 by Lion Feuchtwanger, revolves around the rise of the Nazis in Germany and the responses of one Jewish family -- the Oppermanns, owners of a furniture company. The book exerted such a pull on my psyche that I have been recommending it whenever the topic of books or reading or Nazis or danger has come up in conversation. Almost a century later, it remains resonant, no matter the country or the autocrat. Matthew Rose, editorial director

Full text: Looking for something to do in New York? Listen to the 8-Bit Big Band play tunes from the "great video game songbook," or catch Alvin Ailey's holiday season at City Center.
Comedy
'Roy Wood Jr.'s Year-End Reflections'
Dec. 29 at 7 p.m. at the Second City New York, 64 North Ninth Street, Brooklyn; secondcity.com/new-york.
Since leaving "The Daily Show" last year, Roy Wood Jr. has found a comfy new home skewering headlines every Saturday on CNN's comedy panel series "Have I Got News for You," which has been renewed for a second season. And he will greet 2025 with his fourth stand-up special, and first for Hulu, "Lonely Flowers," which premieres on Jan. 17.
But to close the books on this year, the comedian and actor, who hosted the 2023 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner and starred alongside Jon Hamm in the 2022 film "Confess, Fletch," will corral those among his funny friends who have stayed in the city for the holidays. To find out whom he manages to round up, you'll have to show up for this night of jokes and stories.
Tickets are $ 20 at Second City's website. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
Florry
Dec. 28 at 8 p.m. at Baby's All Right, 146 Broadway, Brooklyn; babysallright.com.
Philadelphia has long boasted a reputation as a breeding ground for indie bands. Florry is one such outfit -- though its sound feels as grounded in the rural upbringing of its bandleader, Francie Medosch, as it does in the rock-forward D.I.Y. scene of the city she now calls home. The country influences that bubbled up on the band's 2021 album, "Big Fall," fully envelop its follow-up from last year, "The Holey Bible," which features heaps of fiddle, lap steel, full-band bonhomie and guitar grooves deep as tire tracks on a muddy road.
Florry will bring its convivial spirit to the early show at Baby's All Right on Saturday, with opening sets from the indie-rock quartet Robber Robber and its drummer, who is performing solo as Dari Bay. Tickets are $ 20 (with discounts for purchases of two or four packs) on SeeTickets. OLIVIA HORN
The 8-Bit Big Band
Dec. 27 at 7:30 and 10 p.m. at Sony Hall, 235 West 46th Street, Manhattan; sonyhall.com.
Like Super Mario powered up by an invincibility star, the big band continues to surge forward no matter the challenges the world throws its way.
The large jazz ensembles that thrive today tend to be specialized, keeping alive the spirit of Charles Mingus, Roy Hargrove or Sun Ra, or they present bold new work from leader-composers like Darcy James Argue or Jihye Lee. With its Nintendo 64 ethos, the 8-Bit Big Band, headed by Charlie Rosen, is no less ambitious or forward-thinking. Over four albums that have earned two Grammy nominations, Rosen's crack ensemble has contributed hard swing, fusion funk, quicksilver arrangements and a slick symphonic sheen to what Rosen has called the "great video game songbook," a canon he is helping create on the fly. While the repertoire includes classic Zelda, Mario and Sonic themes, don't expect MIDI simplicity or rote nostalgia: The band's sophisticated treatment of video game songs like "The Last Surprise" from Persona 5 or "Still Alive" from Portal burst with vigor, vision and joy.
The 7:30 p.m. performance is sold out, but a standby line will form at the box office before showtime. Standing-room and V.I.P. tickets remain for the 10 o'clock set; they start at $ 35 on Sony Hall's website. ALAN SCHERSTUHL

Hanukkah Menorah Lighting & Celebration
Dec. 29, 3-5 p.m., at the Seaport, Heineken Riverdeck at Pier 17, 89 South Street, Manhattan; theseaport.nyc.
According to Jewish tradition, Hanukkah commemorates an ancient miracle: More than 2,000 years ago, when the Jewish Maccabees rededicated the temple in Jerusalem after defeating the Syrian-Greek occupiers, they found only enough oil to burn for one day. But the supply lasted for eight, inspiring the eight-day festival.
On Sunday, Hanukkah's fifth day, the Seaport will host a free celebration with an amazing feat of its own: The organization Chabad FiDi will light a six-foot-tall chocolate menorah that will not dissolve into a puddle. Through careful engineering of the candle holders -- and help from the winter cold -- the menorah will blaze without melting.
The festivities will also include plenty of chocolate to eat, along with popcorn, doughnuts, latkes and more holiday treats. Children can make chocolate crafts as well as other Hanukkah-themed art, have their faces painted and enjoy songs performed by young students from FiDi Hebrew School. (An online R.S.V.P. is recommended.)
Bowne & Company Stationers, which is part of the South Street Seaport Museum, will present an activity on the pier, too: Young visitors can stamp individual wooden dreidels with Hebrew letters made of heated gold foil. The drop-in workshop and materials are free; online registration is encouraged. LAUREL GRAEBER
Dance
Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater
Through Jan. 5 at New York City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan; nycitycenter.org.
Move over, nutcrackers and sugar plum fairies. One of New York's great holiday dance traditions is the seasonal showcase of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, a banquet of classic and new works by several generations of acclaimed choreographers, which this year include a few Ailey alumni.
The "All New" program (Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m.) features "Al-Andalus Blues," created by Jamar Roberts and set to songs by Roberta Flack and Miles Davis; and the former Ailey dancer and interim director Matthew Rushing's "Sacred Songs," which repurposes music no longer used in the company staple "Revelations" (a piece that appears on several lineups throughout this run). Other highlights in the coming week are "Finding Free" by Hope Boykin (Saturday at 2 p.m.) and a revival of Elisa Monte's work "Treading" (Sunday at 7 p.m. and New Year's Eve at 2 p.m.).
Tickets start at $ 32 on City Center's website. For added context, you can pair a show with a visit to the Whitney Museum's impressive, illuminating "Edges of Ailey" exhibition, which runs through Feb. 9. BRIAN SCHAEFER

Full text: Here are just a few of the year's finest indies, documentaries and international selections, available to stream at this very minute.
In what has become an annual tradition, this month's guide to the under-the-radar titles of your subscription services spotlights films from this calendar year -- movies that may turn up on the year-end lists of your favorite critics, or as nominations and winners during awards season. Here are just a few of the year's finest indies, documentaries and international selections, available to stream at this very minute:
'Janet Planet' (2024)
Stream it on Max.
The playwright-turned-filmmaker Annie Baker makes an astonishing feature filmmaking debut with this evocative memory piece, set in the hyper-specific milieu of early-'90s New England, but easily transportable to the time and place of your choice. The focus is on 11-year-old Lacy (a delightfully ordinary Zoe Ziegler) and her acupuncturist mother, Janet (a spot-on Julianne Nicholson); other people drift in and out of focus, mostly Janet's romantic partners, all of whom are clearly ill-advised for one reason or another. It's less a plot-driven narrative than a collection of moments, accumulating into a languid yet pivotal summer, captured in up-close, and sometimes off-kilter, compositions.
'Didi' (2024)
Stream it on Peacock.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Like "Janet Planet," Sean Wang's coming-of-age movie dodges many of the traps and tropes of the form -- primarily by spotlighting an imperfect protagonist, the soon-to-be-middle schooler Chris Wang (Izaac Wang), who can be quite the little jerk when he wants to be. Wang sets Chris's story in the summer of 2008, and is uncommonly perceptive in replicating the details of being a kid online during that time: communication via AOL Instant Messenger, self-expression via YouTube, and social media via Myspace, where a punting from the "top friends" list was the most emotionally devastating act imaginable. The director is similarly adroit at capturing the nervousness of first crushes and the sound and fury of teen sibling arguments, but the most tender scenes involve Chris's difficult relationship with his mother, played with depth and melancholy by the wonderful Joan Chen.
'The Taste of Things' (2024)
Stream it on Hulu.
Tran Anh Hung's story of a gourmand (Benoît Magimel) and the cook he loves (Juliette Binoche) falls in the great tradition of food movies, with scene after sumptuous scene of preparation and consumption, often rendered in hushed and respectful silence. And like the best food movies, it's a love story, recognizing cooking as an act of intimacy rivaled only by lovemaking itself (and, for some, surpassing it). The central couple's longstanding romantic arrangement -- they work together, they sometimes spend the night together, but she refuses his offers of marriage -- gets extra juice from the actors, who were romantically involved decades ago and bring that subtext into the pair's loaded interactions. It's a lovely, elegant movie, as delicate as a delicious soufflé.
'Power' (2024)
Stream it on Netflix.
"This film requires curiosity, or at least suspicion," explains the director Yance Ford, in the voice-over that begins this documentary meditation on policing in the United States. His narration is quiet and searching, the voice of a man who would not presume to know the solution to our current predicament, but knows we're in one. With the help of the editor Ian Olds, Ford examines the origins of municipal policing, challenging assumptions both social and historical, and digging into the systemic issues that prevent effective law enforcement and hinder accountability for those who abuse it. Artfully manipulating archival footage and sound, with pointed juxtapositions and a haunting score, "Power" is a thought-provoking picture whose conclusions have grown even grimmer in the half-year since its release.
'Do Not Expect Too Much From the End of the World' (2024)
Stream it on Mubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The Romanian director Radu Jude makes vexing satires of contemporary life, and his latest is a rude, bitter, buckshot-scattering takedown of grind culture, corporate doublespeak, public relations and living online. His protagonist is Angela (Ilinca Manolache), an overworked production assistant for an industrial video company, who spends a typical day running her boss's errands and conducting interviews, while picking up passengers for a few extra bucks and making vulgar TikTok videos for a few extra laughs. Jude's movies are an overflowing stew, the pot perpetually boiling over with stray ideas and provocations, so there's more to discover; the results are messy, and occasionally stamina-testing, but sharp and scathing all the same.
'Hundreds of Beavers' (2024)
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
The current media ecosystem isn't conducive to cult movies anymore, but occasionally one breaks through, an out-of-nowhere slice of outsider cinema that astounds and baffles viewers in equal measure. That's the case with this refreshingly unconventional frontier comedy from the director Mike Cheslik, a black-and-white, dialogue-free romp filled with surrealist slapstick and actors in oversized animal costumes. Ryland Brickson Cole Tews stars as a fumbling fur trapper who must catch and kill the titular quantity of animals to win the hand of his lady love, but that's just a clothesline on which to hang a seemingly inexhaustible supply of clever comic bits. Its low-budget chintziness becomes its charm, with Cheslik drawing inspiration from everything, whether it's Chaplin or Nintendo. It's just the darnedest thing -- and that's a compliment.
'The Truth vs. Alex Jones' (2024)
Stream it on Max.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The Onion's recent bid to purchase the bankrupt Infowars, the digital brand of the noted conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, gives Dan Reed's excellent documentary about Jones's fall from grace a bit of an extra kick. Reed interviews Jones's former staff members to detail how he came to fame. He also talks to several parents of children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 to show how Jones's relentless insistence that the mass shooting was a hoax turned into a yearslong campaign of digital and personal harassment. The families started filing lawsuits in 2018, culminating in the largest verdict for a defamation case in U.S. history. There is some satisfaction and schadenfreude in that outcome, but this isn't just a courtroom blow-by-blow; Reed gets into the weeds of how this business worked, and how Jones's paranoia was so profitable. It's a vital examination of the warped American psyche -- of the man who made these claims, and the people who believed them.

In a Video Game World, Life Moves Fast: [Review]

Full text: Keanu Reeves steps in as Shadow, while Jim Carrey doubles his fun as Robotnik in this action-adventure comedy.
Sonic the Hedgehog has always been a star. When introduced in the early 1990s, the fuzzy blue speedball was the mascot and lead character for Sega's home video game console, a potent rival to Nintendo's plumber Mario, who originated in arcade games. Mario got a still-risible start in movies back in 1993, in "Super Mario Bros.," a live-action picture starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo that has since developed a cult following. He bounced back in 2023 with an animated adventure replete with eye-popping graphics but lacking a certain "it's-a me" charm.
In contrast, the hedgehog's transition to the cinema screen has been smooth speed-of-light sailing, at least in terms of his commercial appeal. The first picture knocked Marvel off the top of the highest-grossing superhero movies, because Sonic is, sure, a superhero. The second one broke some of the records reset by the first. And so we have the inevitable third, again a mix of live-action and animation, again featuring Jim Carrey in the role of Ivo Robotnik, Sonic's human nemesis, again featuring James Marsden and Tika Sumpter as friendly Montanans. Their job is to keep Sonic (voiced with try-hard amiability by Ben Schwartz) and his pals Knuckles (red and surly, but in a cute way, voiced by Idris Elba) and Tails (yellow and just plain cute, voiced by Colleen O'Shaughnessey) comfortable when they're not off on save-the-planet adventures.
"Sonic the Hedgehog 3," directed by Jeff Fowler, begins not with Sonic but with Shadow, who's kind of like the older brother Sonic never knew he had. Shadow is bigger, has more color, wears the hedgehog life rings (a feature of the video game -- just go with it) around his ankles and wrists, and has a poor attitude that gets worse when he remembers his more cheerful past, centered around a lively young girl named Maria. Shadow is voiced by Keanu Reeves with suitable emo brooding.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Unleashed on the world after 50 years in "stasis," Shadow wreaks plenty of havoc in Tokyo. The agents of the "Guardian Units of Nations," a.k.a. GUN, led in part by Director Rockwell (a frozen-faced Krysten Ritter), can't counter him. Sonic and his pals can't fathom him.
The narrative is powered by doppelgängers (bet you never thought you'd read that in a review of a Sonic the Hedgehog movie). While Sonic puzzles out Shadow, Carrey's Robotnik discovers a never-even-intuited (as opposed to long-lost) grandfather. Get ready for the sight of two Jim Carreys engaging in sanctioned buffoonery.
It's hard to settle on what's more bombastic: Carrey's admittedly virtuoso double act, or the teeming computer graphics gadgetry of death and destruction spilling out of every corner of the screen. However you choose to categorize this movie, you have to admit it's a lot -- up to and including a post-credits tease for the next picture in the franchise.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3
Rated PG. Running time: 1 hour 49 minutes. In theaters.

Full text: It was supposed to be a sleepy year for the video game industry. Then came surprise hits like Balatro, Animal Well and Astro Bot.
Last year was particularly strong for the video game industry. Several major releases found critical and commercial success, including Baldur's Gate 3 and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, while smaller indie puzzlers like Chants of Sennaar also delighted audiences.
This year, the environment has not been nearly as kind. The rising cost of game development has hurt the bottom line for many studios. Thousands lost their jobs as executives attempted to streamline operations. Despite those challenges, there were many new games filled with creative vision and thought-provoking stories.
Here, in alphabetical order, are some of the best releases of 2024.
Animal Well
A single play-through of Animal Well is enjoyable enough. The game presents itself as a pixelated throwback to Metroidvania puzzlers, where players traverse a complicated labyrinth of rooms in search of power-ups that will open new paths and secrets. But in Animal Well there are secrets beyond those secrets. Players needed to convene in online forums and YouTube comment sections to figure them all out.
That kind of social experiment made a splash when Animal Well was first released, but even a later play-through can rekindle the joy of a game that is constantly -- and at just the right moments -- revealing that it has more tricks up its sleeves. (PC, PlayStation 5, Switch, Xbox Series X|S)
Astro Bot
Sony executives have never committed to a single mascot for their PlayStation brand. They flirted with characters like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon through the early 2000s before adopting grittier personas in the 2010s like Kratos from the God of War series and Aloy from the Horizon franchise.
Astro Bot, the protagonist of several tech demos, barely registered until the 2020 release of Astro's Playroom, a free game packaged with PlayStation 5 consoles. It became so popular that developers at Team Asobi created a full platformer that gives the little blue robot planets to explore and coins to collect in a celebration of Sony's history. The result is a quirky and lighthearted adventure that feels like a spiritual successor to Nintendo's Super Mario Galaxy games. (PS5)
Balatro
Nobody could have expected in the year 2024 that one of the most addicting games in recent memory would be a card game that turns poker on its head. But Balatro has sold more than two million copies with joker cards that allow players to bend the game's rules in their favor. Their random distribution makes for addicting play-throughs.
A recent port of the game to Android and iOS devices means you may be seeing commuters playing Balatro for years to come. It's a testament to the anonymous developer behind the project, LocalThunk, who was inspired by playing the Cantonese card game big two with co-workers. (Android, iOS, PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)
Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
Had players experienced a collective delusion in 2022 when Elden Ring was released to rave reviews despite its sadistic difficulty and arcane rules? Not at all. A return to the Lands Between in the expansion Shadow of the Erdtree proved that the formula refined by Hidetaka Miyazaki remained a powerful draw. Vertical level design and seemingly impossible boss fights reminded players that victory feels even sweeter after being crushed by an enemy ten -- or a hundred -- times. (PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)
Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth
Nostalgia is a powerful drug -- and a moneymaker, if the many remakes and sequels coming from the entertainment industry are any indication. But there is something special about Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth that remains with you, even months after playing it.
Some players say it is overstuffed with optional side quests; others are unhappy about an ending that seems needlessly designed to keep the death of a main character ambiguous. But these complaints feel minor for a game with sweeping narrative moments about a beautiful world headed toward environmental collapse. It helps that the gameplay remains one of the best compromises between classic turn-based strategy games and modern button-mashing action games. (PS5)
Helldivers 2
More than 12 million players have battled against hordes of alien bugs and robot soldiers across the galaxy of Helldivers 2. A smart design has gamers from around the world cooperating in missions that often scale to the limit of a user's ability, leading to breathless battles and shootouts with acid-spitting insects and terminator machines. Although Helldivers 2 takes inspiration from past sci-fi creations, including "Starship Troopers," it refines the gameplay loop into a chaotic battlefield of crossfire and ambushes. (PC, PS5)
Metaphor: ReFantazio
With enemies lifted from Hieronymus Bosch paintings and a narrative that takes a Dickensian twist on political powerlessness, Metaphor: ReFantazio constantly surprises. The world feels alive in the magical Kingdom of Euchronia, where your protagonist attempts to find a cure for a dying prince. But reality bleeds into this fantasy world as you live each day, completing basic tasks and forming bonds with other characters in a system inspired by another Atlus franchise, Persona.
During a period when many Hollywood films seem politically gutless, it's surprising to find a game that deals frankly with issues like racism and caste, asking players to think about their image of a utopian society. It helps that the gameplay is incredibly smooth and that its turn-based combat has strategic depth. (PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S)
Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown
One of the most overlooked games of the year, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a superb addition to the long-running series, which has struggled to regain its footing since the 2000s. The main character, Sargon, explores a labyrinthine sacred city where time seems to have no meaning -- or at least a different meaning for his companions.
This is a special game with fluid action and difficult puzzles that make you feel like a genius for solving. It's a shame that it might be the only game like it in the series -- after poor sales, the game's publisher, Ubisoft, announced that it had rejected a planned sequel and disbanded the development team. (PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)
Silent Hill 2
When the original Silent Hill 2 released in 2001, it was immediately recognized for a psychologically thrilling story that had more to say about humanity than many of the zombie-slasher games from that period. It starred a flawed protagonist named James Sunderland, a widower lost in a foggy town whose rooms seem to bend around his memories.
This year's remake is a meticulous refinement of what made the original so impressive. The attention to detail can be seen in how the voice actors deliver their lines and how Sunderland's attitude and physicality shifts as he discovers dark truths about himself. (PC, PS5)
Still Wakes the Deep
This poor electrician named Caz is stranded on a perilous ocean oil rig that is collapsing off the Scottish coast. Through his eyes, the player experiences a horror of underwater creatures and gore, armed with little more than a flashlight and sometimes a hammer.
But it's a small design decision that really gets under your skin. Designers at the Chinese Room pulled the camera back just far enough in this first-person game to see Caz's flailing arms. You watch them shake with fright and shiver with cold. It makes him feel all the more human as he attempts to escape the burning rig. (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S)

I Never Should Have Picked Up That Gun: [Op-Ed]

Full text: This essay is part of How to Live With Regret, a series exploring the nature of regret and the role it plays in all our lives. Read more about this project here .
I was 11 years old the first time I picked up a gun. I should have been playing Nintendo or riding my bike with friends, but instead I was in front of a mirror, posing with the 9-millimeter Glock pistol I had just stolen from a neighbor's house. My mom was at work and I was home alone, skipping school for the second time that week.
The thick pistol was heavy in my little hand. I shifted the gun into different positions, trying to see which looked most intimidating. I knew it was loaded because the first thing I did when I got it was release the magazine. I was just a kid, but I knew how. I had seen other kids do it countless times.
It was 1992, and my neighborhood in Tacoma, Wash. -- an area called Hilltop -- was held captive by the crack cocaine epidemic: overpoliced, consumed by poverty and tormented by notoriously violent street gangs. Shootings were common, something kids like me saw all the time. In Hilltop, you could lose your life over a pair of Jordans. If someone wanted your shoes, you had better be able to keep them on your feet. If you let someone take something once, you were a target forever.
In my early years my home was an abusive one, and by the age of 11, I had been mugged, sexually assaulted and jumped by other kids while walking home from school. I was tired of feeling weak and unsafe. I was tired of being a kid. And looking at my reflection holding the gun, I finally saw myself as a man.
At the time, I thought that gun was the solution to all my problems. But little did I know that my choice to pick it up was the first step in a long journey that would lead me to commit many acts of violence against my own community. It would lead to a night at a bar when I would lie bleeding from a gunshot wound. It would lead me to take a young man's life. And, eventually, it would lead me to prison, where I am serving a 45-year sentence for robbery and murder.
Picking up that gun is the single biggest regret of my life -- one that I will have to live with forever -- but years passed before I was able to truly understand the gravity of my actions.
Regret requires perspective. It requires space for reflection. It requires the ability to imagine a future and picture different possible paths your life might have taken. And at the time, I was not capable of this kind of perspective. I had lived my entire life in survival mode. Nothing existed aside from the threat immediately in front of me. I had no chance to process what was happening around me. That kind of life allowed me to make excuses for all of my actions.
As a kid and then a teenager with a gun, I was convinced that I was never going to go to college or hold a good job, and no other path to success seemed open to me. I was poor and hungry and burdened by a childhood filled with trauma.
I wasn't able to experience regret until I detached from a lifestyle in which I was fighting to survive. Only then could I take a step back and see the damage I had caused so many people in the name of what I believed was my own survival.
I went to prison in 2003 and was more than a decade into my sentence before I began to process the trauma I'd been carrying since my childhood. It's surprising, in a way, that this processing happened in prison. The word "rehabilitation" is thrown around a lot in the criminal justice system, but the truth is that prisons are just about the last place anyone should expect to become a better person. Prisons allow hate and violence to fester and intensify. Far from being places where you can reflect on your actions, they can send prisoners like me right back into survival mode.
I didn't start to reflect on my life because I was in prison, but rather despite being in prison. It began when I encountered volunteers from a group that is now an organization called Collective Justice.
The program offered a respite from prison life. I was able to turn a corner and recognize the damage that I had inflicted on my community because the program was designed to help me and my fellow prisoners address the experiences we'd pushed deep down. Most important, the people working with us had experienced similar traumas and cared deeply about us. They could empathize with what we were going through, and they took the time to build relationships with us.
We sat in tight circles and, as we began to trust one another, we shared things many of us had never said aloud. We talked about being abused -- sexually, physically and emotionally -- by the very people who were meant to protect us, and the impact that had on our lives. We talked about using violence to protect ourselves and the shame we felt because of it.
I didn't even realize the effect the group was having on me until I caught myself talking to my goddaughter, who was a teenager at the time, about rape culture. She described her demeaning experiences with boys, and their behavior didn't sound much different from my own at that age.
Not long after my conversation with her, I was threatened by another prisoner. In the past, I would have responded with violence, but this time, I used my words to de-escalate the situation. It was in these moments that I realized who I had been and how far I had come.
And it was at this time that the regret I had suppressed began to surface. It had always been there -- I'd just cordoned it off and built walls around it. But I took a human life. He didn't deserve to die. He was young like me and he was just trying to survive. A lifetime of poor choices that started with the first time I held a gun ended that. My actions took everything away from him and devastated so many others who loved him. Today, there is not a day that goes by that I do not think about the boy I killed.
Feeling regret, and learning how to really sit with it, changed my life. Regret has pushed me to rethink how I live. It has fueled me when I'm burned out. It's why my work ethic is so strong. My regret reminds me that I owe a debt to society. I repay this debt through mentoring my fellow prisoners. I teach them that violence cannot be a lasting solution to their problems and encourage them to live a life where they give more than they take.
In prison, I am surrounded by men who are living with regret. And that regret is an incarceration every bit as real as the towering walls and razor-wire fences around us.
We should look at regret, and let it be our teacher. But some of the people who most need its lessons are the ones least able to find the time and space to absorb them.
The regret I feel will never subside; it is a part of me now. But what I choose to make of it is up to me. It's what pushes me to continue fighting to be a better person and to help others be better people, too.
I regret the day I was a little boy who foolishly thought I needed a gun to protect myself. But I am not that boy anymore, and when I look at myself in the mirror today, it is with a deeper and more complicated sense of who I am. It may seem odd to say that I'm grateful for regret, but I am. I owe my growth wholly to my ability to feel regret for the things I've done. And I hope that, through the work I do now, I can help those around me experience its life-altering power.

After Dismaying Prognosis, One 'Perfect Day' to Savor: [Society Desk]

Full text: When Moira Legault, who has brain cancer, was given about a year to live, she knew she wanted to spend the rest of her life with Tyler Ferron.
Moira Collette-Jean Legault had just awakened from a brain operation when she received some devastating news. She would most likely have about a year to live.
Tyler Scott Ferron, Ms. Legault's partner of five years, rushed into her room at Vanderbilt University Medical Center right as the surgeon was delivering the prognosis.
It was a weekday in early May, and Mr. Ferron had left his shift as a maintenance technician at Brookdale Senior Living, a nursing home in Brentwood, Tenn., early. It was then that he asked Ms. Legault what she wanted to do in her final year.
Ms. Legault, 27, has a type of brain cancer called astrocytoma and was having a shunt placed in her head during the operation. She said she wanted to travel -- that is, to go anywhere within driving distance since it wasn't recommended for her to fly on a plane. A few weeks later, she started a GoFundMe account to raise money to cross off bullet points on her bucket list.
Her No. 1 wish was to marry the love of her life. "I said, 'Let's do it,"' recalled Mr. Ferron, also 27.
"I'm just trying to spend as many days as I can with this man," Ms. Legault said.
Ms. Legault had known she wanted to spend her life with Mr. Ferron pretty much since they first met in February 2019 in Nashua, N.H.
"I don't necessarily know if I believe in an afterlife or not, but it's somewhat nice to know that if there is one, I'll be there waiting," Ms. Legault said.
They met while sifting through old vinyl records at Newbury Comics at Pheasant Lane Mall in Nashua.
Ms. Legault grew up in Littleton, Mass., and Mr. Ferron in Candia, N.H. The two towns are about an hour away from each other, and the mall is in between both towns. As teens, it was a meet-up spot, the one place, Ms. Legault said, where anything remotely interesting was happening.
Immediately, they bonded over their shared love of rock and jazz, as well as Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin -- "the oldies stuff," as Ms. Legault put it.
They hit it off and wandered around the mall for hours. But when they finished making the rounds through both floors, they didn't yet want to part. Ms. Legault invited him to her apartment to see her newborn kitten, Beans.
That night, they shared their first kiss. From then on, they hung out almost every day. They built Legos together, painted, and visited quaint towns around New Hampshire's White Mountains, where they snapped photos of street murals and autumn leaves. They also played lots of Mario games on their Nintendo Switch and GameCube.
"She's just one of the kindest and sweetest people I've ever met," Mr. Ferron said. Early in their relationship, she left him gifts like his favorite snacks (pumpkin pie and Chex Mix), flowers and "little sappy love notes," she said. "He's a teddy bear."
"I've never met anybody like him," Ms. Legault said. "He's just full of not only fun facts, but just so intelligent, and I'm just so drawn to him."
In June 2021, about two years into their relationship, the couple moved to Nashville, where they had found an affordable apartment along the Cumberland River. Ms. Legault worked remotely as an order entry manager for Kriss Law/Atlantic Closing & Escrow, a real estate company based in Needham, Mass. Mr. Ferron found work in property maintenance.
Though Ms. Legault is more of a recluse and spent most of her time working from home and playing with Beans and Mr. Ferron's cat, Sterling, Mr. Ferron found a community of friends in Nashville that he had never really had in his hometown.
Ms. Legault considers those days to be some of "the best" of her life, adding that she wishes she could go back to that time.
But in February 2023, everything changed.
For as long as Mr. Ferron had known her, Ms. Legault had been experiencing painful headaches. In the months leading up to that February, it was getting worse, and she was suffering from severe vomiting. She made several trips to the emergency room.
"I always just ended up walking out with a big bill and no solution," Ms. Legault said. "There were points where I was in a fetal position on the floor."
That month, an M.R.I. scan revealed that she had a brain tumor in her frontal lobe that had been growing slowly over the years. A few months later, a doctor detected another tumor in her brain.
Through it all, Mr. Ferron was her rock. After returning home every day, he asked her if she needed anything: water, medication, an extra blanket. He cooked every night, did the dishes, and if she couldn't eat because she was too sick, he'd put something in the fridge for later. He always ran home from work whenever she was really ill, and he'd always take her to her medical appointments.

Ms. Legault's prognosis kept getting worse, and a third tumor developed. To comply with her parents' wishes, she moved into their basement in Littleton in May. Mr. Ferron wanted to be with her, so he followed her up North and moved into his grandparents' home in Nashua.
Quitting his job and relocating "bankrupted" him, he said: "I had no other place to go." Mr. Ferron is currently working in private maintenance while also trying to advance his writing career. In 2021, he self-published a novel called "The Reaper Chronicles" under the pseudonym F.T. Scott. The novel's main character is loosely based on his own life as a child who spent years in a foster home and found it hard to fit in.
Leaving Nashville was tough for Mr. Ferron. "Finally, I did find a place where I fit in -- great job, great co-workers and I really saw a future following that job." But it was a sacrifice that was necessary. He knew he could find another job, but he said the opportunity to be with his soul mate was invaluable.
Ms. Legault was a strong support system for Mr. Ferron throughout the publishing process, offering feedback and encouragement. Now, as he works on a second novel, she still cheers him on.
"It's always kind of been just the two of us against the world," Mr. Ferron said. "I'm perfectly content just cuddling with her in bed, taking care of her, and we'll put on a movie, or we'll put on a Mario game together like we used to."
When the couple decided to get married in May, they weren't sure how they would do it. They had blown through their savings to pay for treatments, and in November, she left her job and her benefits were terminated. They weren't sure how they could afford a wedding -- even a simple one.
In June, Mr. Ferron discovered Wish Upon a Wedding, a nonprofit group that grants weddings and vow renewals to couples facing terminal illnesses. They contacted the organization, which connected them with Sophie Escoll, a 32-year-old publicist in Charlestown, Mass. Ms. Escoll had been planning a 200-person wedding in Newport, R.I., for August.
Three weeks before the wedding date, the couple called it off. Ms. Escoll wanted to make good use of the vendor services that had already been paid for. She was also a cancer survivor who has been free of ovarian cancer since 2021. So, when her wedding planner discovered Wish Upon a Wedding, Ms. Escoll saw an opportunity to pay it forward and help another couple begin their marriage.
"I had spent almost two years planning this crazy wedding that never came to fruition, and it felt like it would be another layer of loss, beyond the breakup of my relationship, to lose everything we had put into the wedding," Ms. Escoll said. And luckily, Ms. Legault and Mr. Ferron were in the area. "The stars aligned," said Lacey Wicksall, the organization's executive director.
Almost $ 30,000 of transferable vendor services were donated to the couple, including the wedding planner and designer, Lindsey Shaktman of Mavinhouse Events, which is based in Ipswich, Mass.
The wedding was held on Nov. 7 at Amherst Woman's Club in Amherst, Mass., in front of about 50 guests. Ashton Ferron, Mr. Ferron's brother, led the ceremony. The couple did not get legally married because Ms. Legault did not want to pass the debt she incurred as a result of her cancer treatments to Mr. Ferron.
"It ended up being the most perfect day," Ms. Legault said. The couple stayed at a hotel on Amherst College's campus, and on the morning of the wedding, Ms. Legault met her stepmother, Cynthia Legault, and five bridesmaids at the venue. They got ready, had some doughnuts from Dunkin', and slowly, guests started arriving.
Both their dads walked Ms. Legault down the aisle to "Wonderful Tonight" by Eric Clapton. For their first dance song, the couple danced to "Only You" by the Platters.
For Mr. Ferron, the highlight of the day was seeing Ms. Legault walk down the aisle. "From not knowing whether we'd get to that point, to six months later just seeing everything kind of come to fruition the way we wanted it -- it was just a really surreal moment to finally see that happening," he said.
Though Ms. Legault hasn't received an updated prognosis, she underwent chemotherapy and radiation over the course of several months, and her three tumors are currently stable.
"One day at a time is kind of my mojo really, right now," Ms. Legault said. "But I know that he would be here for me no matter how ill I got."
On This Day
When Nov. 7, 2024
Where Amherst Woman's Club, Amherst, Mass.
Something Borrowed Ms. Legault borrowed a dress that her stepmother had worn at her own vow renewal. Ms. Legault's original wedding gown no longer fit her because she had gained 60 pounds from chemotherapy. "It was nice to feel pretty for a day," Ms. Legault said.
An Old-Time Vibe For the ceremony, the couple went for a "rustic vibe," Mr. Ferron said. "We're not these big, ritzy and glamorous people. We like something that's more homey, something that kind of embodied the music that we had bonded over."

Full text: I'm a global technology correspondent based in Taipei, and I cover the ways technology affects the biggest geopolitical events outside the United States. The job requires curiosity about the great bustling diversity of the world, and in my consumption habits I try to range as widely as I can. Here's what I've gotten into recently.
Look Back
I often work on investigative projects with teams of colleagues. So this film, about two girls with a shared passion for drawing manga, really hit home. It's as raw and moving a portrayal I've seen about friendships forged over shared intellectual pursuits and the way ambition and envy can get in the way.
Franco
I've been on a deep dive into Franco, the "sorcerer of the guitar" from what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, who pioneered an African style called "soukous," mixing traditional sounds with Latin beats and electric guitar. He died in 1989, before the style of music he made achieved global acclaim, but dozens of his albums are available online.
Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
When I was a child, the mysteries and challenges of Zelda fired my imagination. As an adult, beating the new Elden Ring expansion -- with help from my wife -- gave me the same satisfactions in a way no other art form could. It's only a small exaggeration to say it's what I'm most proud of this year.
No End
When an Iranian invokes the secret police to scare off a relative he fears will displace him, he sets off events that bring down the coercive powers of the state around his family. Having spent much of my career covering autocratic countries, this very dark comedy gets at the prosaic realities of authoritarianism as well as anything I've seen.
Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life
This summer I committed to improving my surfing. To spur me on, I reread this classic from William Finnegan. Wandering from Hawaii to South Africa, he chronicles a changing world, a commercializing sport and one way to live well. According to him, anyone who starts later in life, as I have, is doomed to failure. I'll take my chances.

'Star Wars' Actress Weds, but in a 'Bridgerton' Setting: [Society Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Philicia Saunders and Jordan Wilson discovered a mutual love of cosplay, anime, video games -- and, eventually, each other.
"I'm literally a walking nerd billboard." That's how Jordan Alexander Wilson describes himself.
A few of the reasons he cited: There's a tattoo of a ninja from a Japanese manga series that stretches across his shoulders and down to the small of his back. Four Nintendo video game characters are inked on his left shin, and a quote from a "Batman" comic covers his right rib cage.
But until a Friday afternoon in March 2022, Philicia Shamira Jean Saunders didn't know this side of her co-worker at Bad Robot, the Los Angeles film and television production house of which the "Lost" co-creator J.J. Abrams is a founder.
That afternoon, she took Mr. Wilson to lunch as a thank you for remotely fixing her iPad ahead of an acting audition. It was two years into the pandemic, and because Mr. Wilson had just recently moved to Los Angeles to join Bad Robot's technology support team, the two had only interacted through virtual office meetings.
Mr. Wilson showed up to lunch wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with an anime character that Ms. Saunders, an anime fan herself, recognized right away. Over noodles at Kotoya Ramen in West Los Angeles, Ms. Saunders -- a human resources professional and an actor with two "Star Wars" films to her name -- was surprised and delighted to discover how many other passions she shared with the former Apple Genius Bar technician.
They discovered a mutual love of anime, video games, cosplay and acting. He's a voice actor who has been featured in commercials for Starbucks, Xfinity and the cognac maker Hennessy. She, in addition to playing the Resistance base fighter Tabala Zo in "The Force Awakens" and "The Rise of Skywalker," has appeared in TV series including "9-1-1" on ABC and "How I Met Your Father," on Hulu/FX. She has also performed onstage, currently appearing in "I, Daniel Blake" at the Fountain Theater in Los Angeles.

"Finding a nerd was something I've always wanted in a partner," Ms. Saunders said. "I was like, 'This can't be the person I've been looking for."' She had a firm rule against office romances.
Mr. Wilson was equally captivated by the conversation's effortless flow, and by his co-worker -- she's not only an actor, but a member of Black Swans Synchro, a squad of synchronized swimmers, all women of color, who will be the subject of an upcoming documentary, now in the early stages of development. He had glimpsed Ms. Saunders once in passing at the office, but sitting across from her at the noodle place, he found himself disarmed.
"I was like, 'Wow, she is even more beautiful in person. This is not good," said Mr. Wilson, who was similarly wary of dating a co-worker.
The duo quickly settled into an easy camaraderie, finding any excuse to connect at the office. He would bring her coffee. She would ask him an occasional tech question she already knew the answer to.
"I asked him to help me anyway, just so he could come by my desk," she said. "He's charismatic, he's funny, I love his smile. When he's happy and energetic, it's very contagious."
The cautious pas de deux continued for months, until Mr. Wilson took to heart the words etched on his torso about conquering limits (the full quote: "All men have limits. They learn what they are and learn not to exceed them. I ignore mine"). He asked Ms. Saunders on an official date, suggesting sushi, a favorite of hers, despite his own distaste for it. "I really wanted to impress her and show her that I like her enough to get outside my comfort zone," he said.
That first date in May 2022 lasted six hours, and more followed. By the time their relationship grew serious, Ms. Saunders had moved on from Bad Robot, and is now a senior recruiter at the Plente Executive Search Group. Mr. Wilson followed suit, joining Scopely, a mobile-first video game developer where he works in executive technical support.
Ms. Saunders, 36, grew up in the Ladera Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles, the daughter of a U.S.-born mother and a father who immigrated from Jamaica in his teens. She earned a bachelor's degree in East Asian studies from Princeton and an M.F.A. in acting from the University of California, Los Angeles.
Mr. Wilson, 35, studied studio art at William Paterson University, and was raised in Englewood, N.J., by a single mother and maternal grandmother, with whom he shared an especially profound bond.
"Losing her was definitely the hardest thing in my life, and it's affected me a lot," he said of MaMa, as he called her, who died of cancer in 1998.
Ms. Saunders, he said, "feels like an embodiment of my grandmother's love. From that first ramen date, I was like, 'This is the safest I've felt in a long time. I want to feel this way every day."'
Fantasy worlds permeate the couple's life. Mr. Wilson's drawings, mostly depicting anime scenes, line the walls of the apartment they moved into in September 2024 in the Westchester neighborhood of Los Angeles, that they share with their black cat, Baggie. They revel in trips to Disneyland and Universal Studios and take turns acting out a favorite scene from "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" in their most dramatic British accents. Together, they dress up in meticulously planned costumes for anime conventions and Renaissance Faires.
"It's about not letting go of your inner child and just enjoying the things that make you happy," Mr. Wilson said of the geeky pursuits that bind them. For him, they also have served as a guidepost.
One line delivered by Kamina, a character in the Japanese anime series "Gurren Lagann," resonates deeply with him: "Believe in the you that believes in you."
A little over a year after Mr. Wilson and Ms. Saunders started dating, he recalled those words as he prepared to propose at an Airbnb he had rented overlooking the hills of Tarzana, Calif. When she arrived -- for a romantic private dinner, she'd been told -- Mr. Wilson took her hand and led her up a set of stairs to a patio with two long rows of electric candles that curved into the shape of a heart. He had set up an iPad so their family members could watch over Zoom.
"I was so nervous, I didn't even realize the iPad was pointing too low," Mr. Wilson said with a laugh. "I have a video of it, but our heads are cut off."
Ms. Saunders remembered experiencing her own jitters. "I kind of blacked out a little bit," she said. "It was a lot happening at once." Still, one memory stands out with perfect clarity: "It was an easy yes."
For their engagement photo shoot, the pair embraced their devotion to cosplay, dressing as characters from the Netflix period drama "Bridgerton" -- he as a lord in a blue velvet tailcoat and matching pantaloons, she as Queen Charlotte in a cream-colored lacy Victorian gown with a wide skirt.
Long enthralled with the elegance and etiquette of England's Regency era, Ms. Saunders has watched all three seasons of the show, which is set between 1813 and 1827. But her admiration for the series goes beyond its grand 19th-century costumes.
"I would always watch movies like 'Shakespeare in Love' and I'd be like, 'Oh my god, I would love to wear a nice corset and a beautiful big skirt, but someone that looks like me won't be anywhere in that time period unless she's a servant," she said. "'Bridgerton' came out and it turned that stereotype on its head. You could see yourself in those spaces."
In keeping with the "Bridgerton" theme, wedding invitations sealed with wax summoned 110 guests to celebrate the union of "Lady Saunders and Lord Wilson" on Nov. 10 at the Ebell Long Beach, a 1920s women's club that's been converted into an event space in Long Beach, Calif. Their mutual friend Anwar Ali, ordained by Rose Ministries for the occasion, officiated.
"Beyond the shared interests and inside jokes, there's a pure, simple joy in just being together," Mr. Ali said during the ceremony. "They turn ordinary moments into something special."
"You drive me to be better every single day," Mr. Wilson told Ms. Saunders during his vows. "You push me to be more gentle every day. You encourage me to reach higher than I thought I could reach every day."
"You have helped me discover the best version of myself," Ms. Saunders said to her "cool nerd," as she calls him. "A journey that I have been on my entire life."
Ms. Saunders wore a Vivienne Atelier Bridal dress with a ball gown silhouette befitting a "Bridgerton" ball and a sparkly train that extended almost eight feet behind her. Mr. Wilson wore a burgundy tuxedo, and later changed into a Regency-style coat for their first dance, which began with him kissing his bride's gloved right hand and her curtsying. The pair then glided into period choreography straight out of "Bridgerton" prequel "Queen Charlotte," and straight out of time.
On This Day
When Nov. 10, 2024
Where Ebell Club Long Beach in Long Beach, Calif.
Grandpa's Special Role Ms. Saunders's 97-year-old maternal grandfather James Wilson Ferguson Sr. served as ring bearer. Not a fan of flying, he traveled by train from Columbus, Ohio, to attend the Southern California wedding. "I am his first granddaughter getting married," Ms. Saunders said, "so it's a big deal."
Music to Marry By Mr. Wilson walked down the aisle, accompanied by his mother, Donna Wilson, and older sister Diadra Wilson, as the Harpeggio Quartet played the song "Dearly Beloved" from Kingdom Hearts, one of the couple's favorite video games. Ms. Saunders followed, making her entrance to "Love" from the Disney animated film "Robin Hood." Her parents, Philip and Jean Saunders, greeted their daughter at the end of the aisle as she approached the groom.
Here Come the Suds Each wedding guest received a square of fragrant soap handmade by the bride's older sister and maid of honor, Tamar Saunders. A note with the gift humorously observed that in the modern era, "frequent bathing has become all the rage, quite a departure from Regency times when a wash was more a matter of whimsy than routine."

A Soundtrack Adventure For Donkey Kong Gamers: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: David Wise turbocharged the Super Nintendo for scores inspired by the Glenn Miller Orchestra, Prokofiev, Duran Duran and more.
The initial hype about Donkey Kong Country, which was released for the Super Nintendo 30 years ago this week, was centered on its impressive 3-D-ish graphics. But the game's legacy proved to be its soundtrack.
As players led a brawny ape and a cartwheeling monkey through jungles, ancient ruins and snowscapes, they were treated to a musical smorgasbord of atmospheric tunes. The self-taught British composer David Wise, with valuable contributions from Robin Beanland and Eveline Fischer, had managed to coax a richer variety of sounds than had ever emanated from a game console.
"Dave really knew the S.N.E.S. inside out, so he could push it as hard as he could to make it do things that people hadn't heard before," the video game composer Grant Kirkhope said. At the core of Wise's music, though, is "melody, melody, melody."
Wise joined the studio Rare in 1985 and composed for its games, including several entries in the Donkey Kong franchise, until 2009. He has continued to work in the industry, with his latest score accompanying Nikoderiko: The Magical World.
A legion of gamers cherishes the music for Donkey Kong Country and its sequel, which are a bit like the "Revolver" and "Sgt. Pepper" of video game music. In a recent interview, Wise unpacked the process and inspirations, musical and otherwise, behind his music for the first two Donkey Kong Country games.
'DK Island Swing'
The music for Nintendo's Super Mario games had a Latin and calypso influence that fits the hippity-hoppity gameplay as well as the sunny environs of the Mushroom Kingdom. The hulking hero of Donkey Kong Country suggested a different approach.
"Donkey Kong was a little more brutal," Wise said. "Adorable, but quite useful in a fight if needed."
For the first level of the game, partly because he was then learning to play saxophone, Wise sought to emulate the sound of the Glenn Miller Orchestra and the raucous big band music from around the time of World War II. "DK Island Swing" has the propulsive energy of "In the Mood" or Benny Goodman's "Sing, Sing, Sing," complete with rollicking drums worthy of Gene Krupa.
That jaunty jazz is sandwiched between two sections that fuse tribal rhythms with ambient synth sounds, making it quickly clear that gamers were in for a wide-ranging musical adventure.
'Aquatic Ambiance'
For fans of video game music, the serene, transporting "Aquatic Ambiance" has a special renown.
"I think a lot of gamers paused the water stage just to Zen out," said David Lloyd, the founder of the video game music community OC ReMix. "It resonates on a melodic level, but also, especially at the time, on a 'damn this sounds cool!' level -- that the Super Nintendo could handle it, technologically speaking."
The limitations of the Super Nintendo sound chip pushed Wise toward certain musical effects. Over five painstaking weeks, he built the track up with shimmering looping patterns of notes, topping off the layered composition with harp glissandi, reverb-drenched piano and an aching melody worthy of a late-Pink Floyd guitar solo.
Wise was responding musically to the gorgeous lapis lazuli visuals of Donkey Kong Country's water levels. But there was an additional inspiration that might explain why the music evokes such deep reservoirs of feeling: It started off as a breakup song. Although no one is really meant to hear them, all of Wise's melodies have lyrics, he said.
"'Aquatic Ambiance' was inspired by a recently failed relationship," Wise said. "As much as I'd wanted the relationship to work -- I always felt as though I was drowning."
At this point in the game's development, Wise was not officially the composer; he figured that Koji Kondo, Nintendo's go-to composer who worked on Super Mario and Legend of Zelda games, would take over. But Nintendo's boss, Shigeru Miyamoto, apparently heard "DK Island Swing" and "Aquatic Ambiance" and gave Wise his blessing. "That set up my career," he said.
'Gangplank Galleon'
To accompany Donkey Kong Country's end-of-world boss battles, Wise concocted a hectic rocker, "Bad Boss Boogie," which unfurls in the devilish 29/8 time signature that Nine Inch Nails used the same year in "March of the Pigs."
By contrast, "Gangplank Galleon," which accompanies the game's climactic pirate ship boss fight, begins in the frisky style of an accordion-led sea shanty. Wise had picked up two or three CDs of sea shanties, along with an album of barrel organ tunes, for inspiration.
But the jolly tone gives way to something fiercer and more appropriately epic: a galloping rhythm on the drums, insistent bass and scorching guitar notes. "It's basically a sea shanty-meets-Iron Maiden," Wise said. If the force of Wise's version was constrained by the technology, it provided the blueprint for a plethora of face-melting heavy metal covers.
'K. Rool Returns'
From the outset of Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest -- the sequel arrived a year after the first game -- it was obvious the musical palette had expanded. The game's title screen is accompanied by swashbuckling orchestral music that nods to, of all things, the state anthem of the Soviet Union. There is also a little bit of John Williams's "Flight to Neverland" from the movie "Hook" thrown in.
To suit the sequel's darker setting and ramped-up difficulty, Wise, the sole composer this time around, concocted a suite's worth of musical pieces -- including "Welcome to Crocodile Isle" and "Boss Bossanova" -- inspired by Russian composers, with clear nods to Mussorgsky and Prokofiev.
"The main baddies in the game were Kremlings," Wise said, pointing out a play on words that, it is safe to say, went over the head of most 10-year-olds. "It seemed entirely obvious that some Soviet-styled music might be a good fit. They just had a way of using the orchestra to evoke such emotional strength."
'Forest Interlude'
The soundtrack for Donkey Kong Country 2 featured Celtic musical influences, Hans Zimmer-esque action-movie bombast, ragtime, electronic dance music and Vangelis vibes.
A number of pieces showed off Wise's facility with an FM radio-friendly pop-rock sound: "Hot Head Bop" had an irresistible bass lick, "Mining Melancholy" was driven by pickax percussion and "Bayou Boogie" borrowed -- for the swamp level -- the doom-laden opening drum pattern from Phil Collins's "In the Air Tonight." There were even a couple of bars of monkey hip-hop.
One of Wise's most stunning compositions, "Forest Interlude," began as an attempt to recreate the hypnotic synthesizer sounds of Duran Duran's "Save a Prayer." The resulting lush and exotic soundscape, featuring plaintive pan flute and sprinkled with birdsong, turned out to be perfect for the game's spooktastic forest levels.
But the most captivating track was a spiritual sequel to "Aquatic Ambiance."
Wise said he had originally put the song together thinking it would be for another water level. Instead, "Stickerbush Symphony," with its strangely melancholic New Age groove, accompanies a level in which the player navigates a fantastically cruel maze of spiky vines. "Now that level is hard," Wise said. "This almost calming tune adds a nice juxtaposition to the gameplay."
It also guaranteed extensive exposure to the song, creating formative musical memories in the minds of a generation of gamers.

Amid the Exploding Carrots, Wackiness Abounds: [Review]

Full text: Everyone's searching for something in Lego Horizon Adventures, where a science fiction franchise gets an entertaining brick makeover.
More often than not, the long-running children's series of Lego video games has focused on instantly recognizable characters: Batman, Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker.
The star of Sony's science fiction Horizon game franchise does not have such an expansive fan base. Yet the single-minded, redheaded Aloy is a wise choice for one of these lighthearted branded games, which exude so many happy, humorous vibes.
In this Lego world, Aloy's battle is against formerly peaceful animal-robots like the Sawtooth, a riff on pouncing saber-toothed tigers. They shoot swirling circles of fire. The Buried Shadow, the darkest, scariest creature in the Horizon series, is a cute but devilish balloon blob here, something well-suited for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. You can hide from most of the machines in patches of tall grass, which Aloy calls "so itchy."
Aloy also needs to discover her own origins, often via a holographic character named Elisabet. The eager warrior's base of operations is called Mother's Heart, inhabited by nature lovers who are hunter-gatherers. As you progress, the almost-unpopulated town grows as you build customizable structures, totems and environments. Fifteen hours in and you'll find it teeming with clucking chickens and plastic minifigures who fish, eat, converse, dance and generally enjoy life. Just look at their animated drawn-on faces.
The stripped-down plot eschews the game franchise's serious, sometimes perplexing epic tale that features Aloy as kind of a religious savior. Here, the objectives are simpler, clearer -- and unapologetically goofy.
Other heroes from Horizon Zero Dawn make appearances as playable protagonists in a postapocalyptic world where there's no "social media or cat videos." The reinvention of the clumsy Varl, an ardent warrior, includes a passion for comic book collecting. He puts on gloves before touching a rare graphic novel.
The crumbs in this game's trail are shiny Lego studs, which also can be used to buy outfits and upgrade Mother's Heart. Sometimes, you find treasure chests full of them.
In the store, you can also add items from Ninjago, another Lego-branded game, and modern buildings. This mash-up doesn't dovetail with the carefully created Horizon milieu where Sony's lush, lurid environments are so meticulously reinvented through Lego blocks and pieces. No one is yearning to see a bright white police station in a land where lumber is the primary building material.
Each robotic machine is introduced in a comical but terrorizing cut scene, its name boldly and brightly emblazoned onscreen. The level design is generally repetitive. Walk over arched bridges and attractive waterfalls. Stock up on studs. Open a vendor's treasure chest to discover a power-up, like fiery boots Aloy can wear to jump over an enemy and burn them. Fight a number of machines in a circular environment reminiscent of a corral. Receive a gold brick reward and begin the next chapter.
In previous Lego games, a single player could switch between two heroes. Here, I could only explore and fight as one at a time, with Aloy the choice for most of my trek through blocky mountains and humid jungle lands. There were other frustrations like the inability to select power-ups. One of Aloy's lines -- "the wilds reward the curious" -- went from a mildly sage observation to an irritating maxim.
Lego Horizon Adventures, however, is generally very pleasant and entertaining. When I changed my character to Teersa, an elder who has "survived 13 grandchildren," I was able to toss exploding carrots or land sharks. The mustachioed Erend, with his eternal love for doughnuts, wielded a giant hammer that recalled Thor's Mjolnir. With a flame upgrade, Erend was more powerful than Aloy against the mechanized beasts.
The wackiness never stops. Dropping a hot dog cart damages enemies considerably more than the tossable bombs found scattered along the battle arena. While the gameplay is similar from area to area, the fighting stages become bigger and more complex as you proceed. A small, inviting pond may freeze you briefly. Sharp briar patches will sting you, eating away at your health.
For adults, who can join in the play by adding an extra controller, the treats include some nostalgic pop culture riffs. Seeing a level titled "Desperately Seeking Sawtooths" evoked a smile. As a fun romp for all ages, Lego Horizon Adventures will probably be one of the season's most requested holiday games.
Lego Horizon Adventures was reviewed on a PlayStation 5. It will be released on Thursday and will also be available on the PC and Nintendo Switch.

After the Triumph of Tetris, an Unsolved Puzzle: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Alexey Pajitnov, who created the ubiquitous game in 1984, opens up about his failed projects and his desire to design another hit.
Alexey Pajitnov, the architect of the falling-and-rotating-block puzzle game Tetris, is one of the industry's most illustrious designers. The calming and chaotic formula he developed as a computer engineer in the Soviet Union has resulted in dozens of variants -- Tetris Plus, Tetris Worlds, Tetris Effect, Tetris 99 -- and more than 520 million sales.
But Pajitnov, 69, is not that interested in talking about that legacy. He prefers conversations about his canceled and ignored games, the past designs that now make him cringe, and the reality that his life's signature achievement probably came decades ago.
"I don't like to talk about success," he said, "because everybody else does."
Pajitnov's contributions are a key component of Tetris Forever, a new game that also serves as a documentary and an interactive museum. Players can watch interviews with Pajitnov and Henk Rogers, his longtime business partner; review artifacts from Tetris's development; and sample more than a dozen versions of the game, starting with a facsimile of the 1984 original as coded on a Soviet-era computer. It also documents the convoluted commercial release of the game beyond the Iron Curtain.
In Tetris Forever, Pajitnov acts like a guest star fulfilling his duties, equal parts smiling and stoic. But in a recent discussion near his home in Bellevue, Wash., he opened up on life beyond Tetris, including his nine-year tenure at Microsoft and his aspiration to release another hit some day.
Pajitnov said that even if his current design experiments never take off, he is happy to be doing them his own way.
"I decided that I will do the game myself," he said about one unreleased project. "Me, myself, enjoyed it a lot. And I don't care whether the other people will like it or not."
As a child, Pajitnov gravitated toward card and board games like Russian bridge and Nim, and loved collections of puzzles and riddles available in Soviet libraries. In high school, books by the mathematicians Martin Gardner and Henry Dudeney were life-changing discoveries.
Tetris Forever chronicles the confluence of mathematical study, computer science and puzzle design that resulted in Tetris. A beloved math book ("Polyominoes: Puzzles, Patterns, Problems and Packings") and a related wooden-block puzzle stayed with Pajitnov during his Soviet computing career, where he adapted the physical puzzle to work on a screen. The result had the same infinitely challenging quality of assembling his wooden blocks.
"I love a strong feeling of pleasure for accomplishment," Pajitnov said. "I love to solve the puzzle. I like the beauty of it."
Even so, Pajitnov was rankled by how journalists framed the news that a 13-year-old boy had crashed the Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game with a score of 999999. He said that the accomplishment was "wonderful and I support it" but that it was only possible because of software limitations.
"You can't beat Tetris," he said.
Pajitnov is not sure exactly how many non-Tetris games he has worked on since emigrating to the United States after the fall of the Soviet Union. Many of them originated during his career at Microsoft, which he began in 1996 after dissolving a software company during an economic downturn.
He said he did not apply to Microsoft by simply trotting out his Tetris credentials: "I was kind of stupid Soviet person, but I wasn't that stupid." Rather, Pajitnov noticed that its MSN website was emerging as an early online portal and pitched a series of visual click-and-drag puzzles called Mind Aerobics. They acted like a games section in a newspaper.
He eventually assembled an internal team to remix the puzzle types, create new ones and attach a globe-trotting theme for the 1999 game Pandora's Box. Microsoft released other games by Pajitnov, including the match-three puzzle series Hexic, but the company rarely used his name for marketing.
"I didn't care," Pajitnov said. "I'm very famous with Tetris. I didn't need anything else."
Pajitnov can be critical when looking back at the games he created at Microsoft. "I probably do my usual mistake overcomplicating the title," he said of Pandora's Box. "So everything is too hard for people to digest." But he otherwise defends his game's originality and creativity: "The title was very good."
He added that Hexic looked "so kind of abstract, overcomplicated and whatever that I can't play it myself for more than 10 to 15 minutes."
As Microsoft's gaming division shifted to the console market, starting with the Xbox in 2001, Pajitnov grew disillusioned. "It was very wrong company to start a new platform," he said. "If I could imagine something more wrong, I would be very surprised."
Pajitnov said four or five games he worked on were canceled, including a semi-sequel to Mind Aerobics that he said had a Universal Studios film property attached.
Microsoft was "an absolutely perfect organization" in terms of its approach to large-scale programming, Pajitnov said. But he thought it took the company too long to figure out an ideal audience for the Xbox. "Very kind of rocket-science-oriented people," he said, "and they so don't care about the public, the audience and the gaming." (Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment about Pajitnov's assessments.)
Pajitnov decided in 2005 to semi-retire, with the intent of writing poems and reading books while participating in major decisions with the Tetris Company. He still aspires to release a title he began developing at Microsoft that involves "playing with exotic blocks in some kind of shape, and interesting tasks inside."
His description is richer through the lens of failure: "Every time I show it to somebody, they say, 'Wonderful, beautiful, excellent, but too complicated."'
Reaching the heights of a global hit like Tetris is improbable for anyone, even the creator of Tetris. But that has not stopped Pajitnov from trying.
He has spent nearly 20 years designing and producing free-to-play smartphone games with a small Russian studio called WildSnake Software. Some have glimmers of brilliance but are brutally difficult, like the color-matching tap-to-clear Dwice. Others feel less original, like a pair of games that borrow mechanics from the touch-screen puzzler 2048. All of them have modest production values.
When asked why his WildSnake games have not seemed to capture an audience, Pajitnov said that marketing was not his strength. He has collaborated with Rogers, the president of the Tetris Company, for decades but does not seek his advice on other games.
Pajitnov said what interests him about a game -- "this kind of really sharp mind stuff, kind of more mathematical and abstract solution" -- does not interest Rogers as much. They often do not agree on what projects are worth pursuing.
Rogers used a mid-1990s example to explain their creative divergence. Pajitnov had built a Tetris alternative whose playfield extended across a cylinder, meaning that players could not see all of the pieces. Rogers considered that untenable and recalls telling Pajitnov, "OK, go and build it, but don't get me involved in that, because I already know that it's not going to sell."
Rogers said he had to stay focused on Tetris while Pajitnov came up with new games.
"Alexey had his own musical career where he wanted to do some solo albums, and he did that at Microsoft," Rogers said. "That was his way of, how can I say, releasing his creative juice."
The history told in Tetris Forever, which will be released on major consoles and the PC this week, is comprehensive even if the games in the collection are not. (Versions published by Nintendo for the N.E.S. and Game Boy are glaring omissions.) A new variant sends players time-traveling to older games where the mechanics worked differently.
Pajitnov accepts the marketing responsibility that comes with creating something so popular, gesturing to the "TETRIS" license plate he has transferred from car to car since moving to the United States. He still reads fan mail from all over the world. "It's my job and my mission," he said. "Tetris is my kid, and I take care of my kids."
But his passion is toying with new puzzles, mathematical proofs and games. Tetris allows him to fail comfortably. Attaching the established brand to a new game is always a safe bet.
"Maybe not great pleasure," he said, "but at least guaranteed pleasure."

Large Fast Food Chains Falling Short on Results
The Burger King parent Restaurant Brands and the KFC owner Yum Brands missed market estimates for quarterly results on Tuesday, hit by choppy demand in the United States and abroad from budget-stretched customers.
Increasing fast-food prices over the past year have prompted many consumers to prepare their own cheaper meals at home and avoid eating out, hurting traffic across the industry.
As a result, quick-service restaurant chains have turned to aggressive promotions in an attempt to attract value-seeking customers. Burger King, McDonald's, KFC and Wendy's have all launched $ 5 value meals since June this year to get lower-income customers back into their outlets.
"I don't think anybody's going to be out of trouble anytime soon," said Danilo Gargiulo, senior analyst at Bernstein. "But they're doing something that seems to be working to at least stop the deceleration in traffic." REUTERS

Nintendo Profits Off 60% As Switch Demand Wanes
Nintendo, the Japanese video game maker behind the Super Mario franchise, said on Tuesday that its profit fell 60 percent in the first half of the fiscal year, as demand waned for its Switch console, now in its eighth year since going on sale.
Kyoto-based Nintendo reported a 108.7 billion yen ( $ 715 million) profit for the April-September period, as sales slipped 34 percent from the previous year to 523 billion yen ( $ 3.4 billion).
More than 74 percent of its sales revenue came from overseas, according to Nintendo, which didn't break down quarterly numbers.
Global Switch sales during the period dropped to 4.7 million machines from 6.8 million units the previous year.
But Nintendo said that Switch sales continue and vowed to stick to its goal of selling a Switch console to each and every individual, not just one Switch per every household. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Lower Oil Prices Cause Aramco Profits to Fall
The Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco reported third-quarter profits of $ 27.5 billion on Tuesday, down about 15 percent from last year as low oil prices ate into its revenues.
Aramco had revenues of $ 111.1 billion over the quarter, the company said in a filing. It had $ 113 billion in revenues the same quarter last year. Profits for the third quarter last year were $ 32.5 billion. The profit decrease "was mainly due to the impact of lower crude oil prices and weakening refining margins," Aramco said.
Profit for the first nine months of 2024 was $ 83.9 billion, down from $ 94.5 billion the year before.
Oil prices have been depressed in recent days as Middle East tensions appear to have receded slightly and as China's economy has slowed. Benchmark Brent crude traded Tuesday around $ 75 a barrel.
Aramco said it will pay dividends of $ 20.28 billion for the third quarter. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Plumbers Scramble to Save an Island Chain: [Review]

Full text: Rhythm is a crucial resource in the role-playing game Mario & Luigi: Brothership.
Mario, Nintendo's famously high-voiced plumber, is known to most fans for his action platformers. Less celebrated are the Mario & Luigi role-playing games, which inspire imagination but require a precise sense of rhythm, at least for your right thumb.
Mario & Luigi: Brothership, the pun-filled sixth edition, is set on islands in the high seas. The brothers, piloting a ship that is itself a small island, maneuver through mazelike puzzles and fight monsters using hammers, shock waves and boot stomps. Luigi, the kelly-green-capped brother, comes up with clever, resourceful ideas throughout. A thought bubble featuring an exclamation point appears above Luigi's head when he's thinking hard.
The adventure unfolds somewhat abruptly as a pink, tornado-like vortex sucks up the peppy twosome. But when Mario washes up on the shores of Shipshape Island, only a ghost of Luigi is present. Mournful yowls of "Mario!" and "Luigi!" are heard before the gameplay begins. When the two are reunited, the effect is as touching as it is humorous.
Their form of travel is being shot from a cannon, always accompanied by shocked expressions and much wailing as they plop down on another island (there are over a dozen). While the tale revolves around the usual save-the-world conceit, the twist here is about restoring electricity. The brothers have to reconnect the chain of islands by placing giant plugs into outlets.
Part of what makes Brothership compelling is the momentary rush of joining each island to create a power grid. Linking to a major power source like the Great Lighthouse is dazzlingly colorful to witness. The bright lights, including ropes of flashing lightning, stretch elegantly across the sea.
The personalities of the inhabitants are equally electric, including the beret-wearing sculptors on Rumbla Island. Think of the varied characters in the Animal Crossing series and you'll get the idea. The plug-faced Connie is the ingenious combination of botanist and electrical engineer. Her watering can with a flower tip pours forth a flash of magical energy that begins the process of connecting power. She is as heroic as the ardent brothers, and I wish she were playable.
There are unapologetic puns galore. Connie helps connect. A hammer crafter is called Billdit. Groovemaster Dyode, a cartoony mash-up of Elvis Presley and George Clinton, needs the pair to retrieve hair wax so he can dance again. Once they find it, Mario and Luigi dance with him. Only if they cavort in the correct rhythm are they able to climb a tree (the Twisten Sprout) to a lighthouse.
Leveling up here is all about learning patterns. But the grinding that is endemic to the series can quickly become repetitive. Minor enemies like a sharp-beaked bird with a wild, springing neck must often be beaten a half-dozen times before the brothers can reach an island's main boss.
I had the choice to avoid each battle. Yet it's important to level up and become strong before taking on an island's formidable final enemy. After losing frequently to a boss, you are given the choice of an easier battle. This, after all, is a game for children, as well as arrhythmic nerds like me.
The brothers discover delightfully fascinating power-ups along the way. One has the pair dance cheek to cheek before morphing into a U.F.O. to move over canyons. It's not only fun to use, but showcases their effusive bond.
Brothership isn't undemanding, and it does spark the synapses. In a battle with Gorumbla, a mix of a gorilla and Marvel's the Thing, Luigi finds a boulder that can deal considerable damage. I aimed carefully to try placing the boulder at exactly the right angle. When I didn't, Luigi went rolling in a flourish, somewhat like the hapless Charlie Brown after Lucy takes away his football.
Mario & Luigi: Brothership will be released on Thursday for the Nintendo Switch.

Six Performances That Impressed: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Watch and listen to symphonies by Mahler, a new opera by Missy Mazzoli, Ray Chen's take on video game music and more.
The New York Times's classical music and opera critics attend far more performances than they review. Here are some that hooked them during the past month.
Mahler Firsts
JOSHUA BARONE Despite years of hearing live music, we both had Mahler firsts this month; for me, the Eighth Symphony and for you the Third. Maybe it says something, that a composer so often performed still has his rarities.
ZACHARY WOOLFE Certainly these pieces are difficult to mount; they're as large in scale as symphonic music gets.
BARONE True. I saw the Eighth at the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and it was mind-boggling to witness how much money it must have cost. This piece calls for eight vocal soloists, all of which were luxuriously (though imperfectly) cast, two standard choirs and a children's choir. Mahler described it as having a Barnum & Bailey quality, which I don't see as an advantage. At Symphony Hall, the opening felt as though it couldn't have been anything other than an impenetrable wall of sound.
WOOLFE The Third also demands choirs -- women and children -- though just one soloist. At Carnegie Hall, the Philadelphia Orchestra and Yannick Nézet-Séguin were joined by a star: the mellow-voiced mezzo Joyce DiDonato. She had a kind of majestic clarity, which for me extended to the performance as a whole; it was vivid but never exaggerated.
BARONE In Boston, that kind of heaven-sent sound came from the soprano Ying Fang, who sang from a balcony to the side of the circuslike stage, literally above it all. It should be said that this circus was well managed by Andris Nelsons, who, after an intelligently paced, affecting Ninth with the Vienna Philharmonic over the summer, seems to be in an exciting new period as a Mahler conductor. Still, I don't feel like I need to hear specifically the Eighth again any time soon.
WOOLFE After the hour and forty minutes of the Third, I was kind of pumped to get back inside that capacious world.
'The Listeners'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In the New York region, the unmissable opera of the season so far hasn't been at the Metropolitan Opera, but at Opera Philadelphia, where Missy Mazzoli and Royce Vavrek's "The Listeners" recently had its American premiere. This work's main character is driven toward madness by an unending hum that only she and a few others can hear. The support group that some of them join under the leadership of a self-appointed guru begins to resemble (OK, more than resemble) a cult, with music full of pseudo incantations. Both dark comedy and wellsprings of emotion ensue.
Most memorable were the series of monologues sung by people in the group. Given Mazzoli's gift for inventive yet restrained orchestral textures that let clear, lyrical vocal lines speak plainly, these were effective, enigmatic, unsparing arias. Lileana Blain-Cruz's production -- alert to both the opera's naturalism and its surreally sensual touches -- presented them as reality-TV-style confessionals to a camera, blown up and projected onstage in a way that enlarged and sharpened their impact.
The cast was excellent, and it's been particularly hard to shake the memory of the mezzo-soprano Rehanna Thelwell's focus in playing a sad, lonely woman on a journey from over-the-top satire to something approaching tragedy. ZACHARY WOOLFE
Ray Chen: 'Player 1'
What a happy sight to see a major label like Decca elevate video game music to the symphonic realm. Classical music, after all, has inspired some of the finest video game soundtracks, and video games in turn have influenced some of the finest classical music, like Andrew Norman's "Play."
The music of video games is encyclopedic: by turns epic and intimate, triumphant and anxious. Unlike the cues of movie soundtracks, these scores are designed to respond to a story as it develops, lingering for seconds or hours at a time. On the violinist Ray Chen's album "Player 1," with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Cristian Macelaru, there are no barriers among genres, united above all by Chen's lyrical, grippingly expressive sound.
Chen's style is particularly well suited to Korngold's Violin Concerto, a product of Hollywood's Golden Age and presented here as an ancestor to the modern soundtracks. He also lends a soaringly adventurous voice to the theme from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom; pleasant nostalgia to the Pallet Town theme from Pokémon Red; and allure to the newly commissioned, Joe Hisaishi-esque "Serenade," by Eunike Tanzil.
Sometimes, "Player 1" has the crossover sound of the YouTube star Lindsey Stirling, but that comes with the territory. Perhaps a similar broad appeal will, too. JOSHUA BARONE
A Fresh Approach to 'Rhapsody in Blue'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
How do you commemorate the centennial of "the worst masterpiece" of American music, as the pianist and composer Ethan Iverson called Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue"? If you're the Knights, you pay it forward with an ambitious commissioning project and then bring in Aaron Diehl, one of the most versatile jazz pianists on the scene, to bring fresh rhythmic vigor to Gershwin's classic.
And sure enough, Diehl's intricately eclectic cadenzas were the highlight of the Knights' recent performance of "Rhapsody in Blue" at Zankel Hall. But while the ensemble, conducted by Eric Jacobsen, supplied bold color contrasts and fresh phrasing, the seams between thematic episodes were often jarringly apparent. To some extent, that is in keeping with the individualistic charm of this group, which grew out of chamber music parties in Brooklyn. But as the ensemble grows, its sound seems caught midway between that of a collective of equals and a smooth symphonic blend.
Michael Schachter's own vibrant rhapsody for piano and orchestra, "Being and Becoming," hewed so close to Gershwin's model that it sometimes felt like a shoe box of postcards from the 1920s. The rhapsodes of Homer's time derived their name from the Greek words for stitching and singing. This genre allows a composer to spin free ideas. But it also requires some patience for needlework. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM
Afromodernism at the Philharmonic
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The New York Philharmonic's exploration of Mary Lou Williams's "Zodiac Suite" in 2021 alerted me to the bluesy quality that Sheryl Staples, the principal associate concertmaster, can bring to music by Black American composers. I was reminded of her facility throughout Carlos Simon's "Four Black American Dances," which opened the orchestra's recent "Afromodernism: Music of the African Diaspora" program.
That concert ended with a lovely account of William Grant Still's neglected Fourth Symphony. In the finale of that work, the conductor Thomas Wilkins's deliberate pacing lent extra gravity to a climax that can seem slight if given a pedestrian reading. But even earlier, in the opening movement, the Philharmonic had real snap, with a gorgeous presentation of an early, D major theme leading to some noirish panache during the development, in which Still writes with a flurry of chromatic ideas.
Also on the program was a new cello concerto, "Had to Be," written by the flutist, vocalist and composer Nathalie Joachim. In some densely orchestrated passages, she embraces the tumult of early modernist trends in classical and jazz. Yet her solo lines, for the cellist Seth Parker Woods, are often truly singable. Hope that a recording is on the way. SETH COLTER WALLS

Full text: What better way to celebrate Halloween than with a spooky video game? Here are some of our favorite spine tinglers for pretty much everyone. WIRECUTTER STAFF
Alien: Isolation
The titular Alien is hunting you in this relentlessly moody, period-faithful horror game. It's all about the little details, combining '70s-style imaginings of future tech that looks quaintly dated now with a working-class industrial aesthetic. This game wants you to feel just like the characters in the original film felt: hunted. ARTHUR GIES
Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
What's Halloween without some zombies -- and what's a zombie story without a shopping mall? The game puts you behind the camera of the freelance photographer Frank West, who's dropped into the middle of an American town with a giant mall and a growing zombie problem. You have three days to solve the zombie mystery and get out alive, and what you do in those three days is mostly up to you. ARTHUR GIES
Luigi's Mansion 3
Luigi doesn't get to star in his own games very often. And it's just his luck that when he does, they're full of ghosts. Luigi's Mansion 3 (above right) finds the taller Mario brother hunting specters with his trusty vacuum in one of the Nintendo Switch's best-looking games. Full of spooky-but-cute ghosts (plus some ghostly versions of Mario Bros. standbys), it's a perfect all-ages option. ARTHUR GIES
Mika and the Witch's Mountain
This cozy adventure is about a young witch moonlighting as a postal worker. You start off with a basic broom for your deliveries, but as you progress, you earn upgrades like height boosts and larger carrying capacities. Each parcel you accept has different handling requirements that you need to be mindful of in order to get paid. Flying feels intuitive, but achieving a perfect delivery still poses a fun challenge. HALEY PERRY
Witchtastic
If you've ever played a game like Overcooked, you'll recognize the setup of Witchtastic, which tasks you and your team of witches with brewing potions as quickly as possible. Players must work together to gather and prepare ingredients, stir them into a cauldron and deliver the elixir before time runs out. It sounds simple, but each level poses new challenges.

Full text: Although it's an expensive, arduous process, developers are experimenting with live-action footage to intensify terror.
It is a video game horror renaissance.
Blumhouse Productions, the movie studio behind "Paranormal Activity" and "The Purge," has started a gaming label. Independent developers are drawing inspiration from the original PlayStation and Nintendo 64 eras for low-fidelity shock value. And major studios are remaking classic titles in the Resident Evil and Silent Hill franchises.
To stand out in an increasingly crowded space, some developers are leaning even more closely to their film inspirations by blending live-action footage with virtual worlds.
Actors who convincingly portray their fear in digital performances can help intensify the feeling for players. Last year's Alan Wake 2 enhanced its sense of terror with the frequent use of live-action sequences -- in cut scenes and jump scares -- to blur the line between what is real and what is not.
Current projects that are incorporating live-action footage include Tenebris Somnia, an 8-bit survival horror game in the style of the Nintendo Entertainment System, as well as The Lake House, downloadable content for Alan Wake 2 that releases this week and stars Agent Kiran Estevez, the character portrayed by Janina Gavankar ("True Blood").
But incorporating film footage into a video game is intricate, and the small studios behind those projects are reckoning with the many challenges.
"Live-action hasn't been that common for a long time because of how complicated it is to film," said Andrés Borghi, a filmmaker and a developer of Tenebris Somnia. He mentioned the mid-1990s games Phantasmagoria and Command & Conquer: Red Alert as some pioneering examples of intertwining live-action into the story.
At one recording session for Tenebris Somnia, it took about an hour for a 30-member crew to film two scenes of a few seconds each -- a character walking through a room, and the protagonist becoming increasingly scared by the presence of a monster. It involved several takes, consulting the storyboard and redecorating the space.
"It's a ton of money to get everything set up, and a ton of time to make very little game, very little movie," Borghi said.
Borghi directed short films and worked on visual effects for the horror movie "When Evil Lurks" before deciding to film actors in the flesh for Tenebris Somnia. He was inspired by the small horror game Faith, which blends rotoscope animation with pixel art.
"Everything in pixel art needs to match what we filmed, which is why we opted to prioritize filming and then drawing, instead of the opposite, which is usually harder," Borghi said. "You'll never find a location to build a set in with a door exactly where I drew it."
One of the biggest challenges, Borghi said, has been to maintain the communion between the game and the cut scenes at all times, especially when shooting them out of order and months apart.
Remedy Entertainment, the studio behind Alan Wake 2, learned those lessons during its earlier work on Quantum Break, a 2016 sci-fi game that is part shooter, part TV show.
"We realized in a very painful way that the production models of creating live-action linear content and game content -- where the process is very iterative and we keep on coming back and tweaking things -- are very different," said Sam Lake, Remedy's creative director.
For Alan Wake 2, Remedy decided to approach live action in a modular way. Locations such as the protagonist's writer's room and the set for the fictional talk show "In Between With Mr. Door" are places that recur in the story.
The most laborious shoots took place quite late in production to ensure that filming would not be affected by changes to the script, Lake said. That allowed the team to faithfully recreate in-game locations rather than using a green screen with the virtual environments.
"There's a magic to it," Lake said, regarding the decision to opt for a more practical direction. "During performance capture, the actor needs to imagine the situation quite a bit."
The method of capturing film footage has also evolved for Supermassive Games, the studio working on The Dark Pictures Anthology: Directive 8020, which stars Lashana Lynch ("The Woman King"). Inspired by films such as "The Thing," "Event Horizon" and the "Alien" series, players must elude an alien form that can assume the likeness of its prey.
Supermassive has portrayed actors' likenesses in its games since Until Dawn, a 2015 horror story with branching narrative paths that was remade this month. But by obtaining its own motion-capture suits, Supermassive has streamlined the work, enabling its animators to perform certain tasks without involving third parties.
"We don't have this process where we're calling actors back and living to their schedule, which would be tricky for our needs," said Will Doyle, Directive 8020's creative director.
Working with actors primarily accustomed to the film industry can require extra tact, developers said.
Doyle said Shawn Ashmore ("X-Men") was surprised his character could die in the first act of the studio's 2019 game The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan. And Borghi said he did not want to confuse the actors with too many details about Tenebris Somnia, instead describing what they needed to do in a scene as succinctly as possible.
The game and film industries are continuing to intertwine. The movie "Until Dawn" is scheduled for release in the spring of 2025, and Remedy is working with the studio Annapurna to develop and produce film, TV and audiovisual projects based on Alan Wake and its 2019 game Control.
During the experiments combining the two mediums, including this year's Silent Hill: The Short Message, developers must also consider how faithfully to pursue visual realism.
Remedy had many conversations about intentionally avoiding it, Lake said, deliberately placing colored lights with no visible source to better create the supernatural ambience the studio desired. But some game creators said the focus on graphical fidelity didn't seem to be diminishing anytime soon.
"I think it gets to the point where it becomes indistinguishable from reality, and that's a wonderful possibility," Doyle said. "It's a scary possibility, you know?"

Newest Universal Park Aims to Stake a Claim As Its Own Destination: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Initial ticket packages for the new area of Universal Orlando Resort, the first new Florida theme park in a generation, will cost as much as $ 521.
When the Universal Orlando Resort opened its first Harry Potter rides in June 2010, people waited six hours in 90 degree heat just to get in the gate. Demand overran expectations for months, leaving some visitors with a gridlocked vacation they vowed never to repeat.
Universal, hoping to avoid similar headaches when it opens a much splashier theme park in the resort on May 22, has decided to do things differently.
Initially, tickets for the general public will be sold only for the new area, Universal Epic Universe, which is the first major park to open in Orlando, Fla., in 26 years, as part of multiday packages, the resort said on Thursday. The least expensive option, priced at $ 352 to $ 521, with the cost fluctuating based on the days chosen, will provide one-day admission to Epic Universe and two days of access to the resort's older parks. The packages go on sale Tuesday.
Universal said that additional ticket options, including single-day admission for the grand-opening period, would become available "in the months ahead." (Current annual passholders can buy single-day tickets to Epic Universe starting Oct. 24.)
Epic Universe is expected to attract roughly 10 million visitors in its first full year of operation, according to MoffettNathanson, a research firm.
The company wants to avoid congestion -- to leave visitors, some of whom may be experiencing Universal for the first time, wanting to return. But the multiday focus also underscores Universal's primary mission in adding Epic Universe: It wants more families to view the resort as a weeklong destination and not just a one- or two-day add-on to a Disney pilgrimage.
Comcast, which owns the Universal theme park chain, has poured billions of dollars into Epic Universe, which will feature 70 acres worth of attractions, dining and shopping. (To compare, the Harry Potter area that opened in 2010 covered 20 acres.) Epic Universe will have major rides based on Nintendo video games, films like "How to Train Your Dragon," classic movie monsters and, yes, Harry Potter. The expansion also includes three new hotels.
"Epic Universe signals a new phase in the theme park wars," Craig Moffett, a founder of MoffettNathanson, wrote in a report this year. He estimated that Universal would siphon about a million visitors from the much-larger Disney World from mid-2025 to the end of 2026.

Extreme Weather Plays Well in Video Games: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Designers are increasingly able to render weather conditions as not just evocative visual effects but phenomena that physically affect the player.
The storms start off small in the vehicular survival game Pacific Drive. Raindrops fall on the windshield, as lightning cracks ominously in the distance. In a few minutes, the pristine Olympic Peninsula will shake with nature's full terrible force.
Hollywood has long portrayed extreme weather, and 4-D screenings of the summer hit "Twisters" bludgeoned viewers with wind and water in gyroscopic seats. Yet video games have the power to truly envelop an audience in severe meteorological conditions. Players traverse a virtual environment thrashed by the elements, and are made to feel at the center of an awesome might.
Video games that feature extreme weather -- including The Long Dark (2014), The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017) and Death Stranding (2019) -- owe a debt not just to movies but to George R. Stewart's landmark 1941 book "Storm," regarded by some as the first ecological novel. He begins his story with a cosmic view of Earth and a gestating storm before cataloging its on-the-ground devastation. He gives the turbulent weather front a personality and even anatomy, writing about the "long arms of rain" that "ran miles ahead."
Many decades later, game developers are rendering atmospheric conditions with similarly obsessive detail, requiring players to battle extreme weather alongside other more conventionally animate foes. But virtual weather is largely smoke and mirrors, with game makers using technological tricks to offer a convincing illusion.
Alex Dracott, the creative director of Pacific Drive, wanted to make the game's setting truly feel like the Pacific Northwest, which meant focusing on the quality of light, the severity of downpour and the density of fog.
Dracott and his colleagues created a plethora of base-line effects: haze, rain, cloud cover. On top of those, the team added "weather overrides" for more intense conditions that might affect gameplay, like wind rocking the car. Finally, the team built big set-piece moments that tend to occur at the end of a game level -- when supernatural elements cause the world to tremble.
"We actually ended up with a pretty cool thing where the dynamic elements were like paintbrush strokes," Dracott said.
The rain itself is a small miracle of technological trickery. Because of limits on computational processing power, the rain only ever falls within a 20-meter radius around the player, like a wet bubble. When players are driving quickly in their station wagon, the angle of the rain is adjusted so it matches their velocity. While they steer the car, droplets on the windshield swerve naturalistically across the glass.
As a teenager in Portland and then as an adult in Seattle, Dracott would take long drives through the region's teeming wilderness in a vintage station wagon. Pacific Drive is an attempt to rekindle the emotional core of this experience. "There is something both isolating and comforting about being warm and dry in a car during a storm," he said.
Video games are adept at creating visceral responses of varying intensities: calm, stress, excitement and oftentimes terror.
One of the most engulfing and formidable takes on extreme virtual weather in recent years is the multiplayer shooter Battlefield 2042. At various moments in the 2021 game, tornadoes and sandstorms rip across maps in near-future versions of locales such as Shanghai and Doha, delivering not just chaos and destruction but the eerie calm that follows thereafter.
Unlike in Pacific Drive, the extreme weather in Battlefield 2042 needed to affect tens of players online concurrently, a significant technical challenge -- and physically, not just visually.
"We wanted you to get sucked in, pulled up and spat out," Rickard Antroia, the principal game designer, said.
The solution was a mathematical calculus called vector fields that enable the simulation of fluid and wind-like forces. The beauty of vector fields, Antroia said, is that they can be made to fit any shape: the giant cylinder of a skyscraper-size tornado or the vast boxlike shape of a sandstorm that rolls ominously across a desert. The latter sucks players through its front and spits them out of its back, all while swathing them in billions of billowing dust particles.
The storms in Battlefield 2042, a game Antroia describes as a disrupted world "breaking at the seams," feel both prophetic and, in an odd way, poetic. Storms that are terrifying at first are quickly normalized during the endlessly repeating series of online skirmishes.
After a few hours, the storms are something you come to look forward to, and even learn to exploit. One tactic involves riding to the top of a tornado before flying across the map using a wingsuit, unleashing a hail of bullets on those staring at the monstrous whirlwind.
As extreme weather continues to intensify in the real world -- Hurricane Helene dumped rain far inland, killing at least 200 people -- players should expect to grapple with more of it in their game worlds. Exoborne is a forthcoming multiplayer shooter set in an apocalyptic United States that the video game's creators say is "transformed by extreme forces of nature." Wood & Weather promises to let players manipulate meteorological conditions that can permanently alter the game world.
The city-building survival game Frostpunk 2, which was released last month, makes subzero temperatures an inescapable, omnipresent force, affecting disease levels, tensions among the citizenry and population growth. The game does not spatially envelop the player in the same way Pacific Drive and Battlefield 2042 do, but it is no less immersive, coloring almost every action and decision in the game.
The first Frostpunk ended with a brutal snowstorm that a player needed only to survive rather than defeat -- what Jakub Stokalski, the sequel's co-director, calls a "boss fight." In Frostpunk 2, the world has begun to thaw a little.
Stokalski does not think the series fits neatly into the "cli-fi," or climate fiction, genre. To him, Frostpunk is more broadly concerned with societal survival -- large-scale, collective responses in the face of dire circumstances.
Yet in the way clouds swirl and the icy tundra darkens -- as the player looks down upon the weather, landscape and city from an elevated perspective -- the Frostpunk series keenly evokes Stewart's novel "Storm." In video games, it is one thing to feel at the center of a bludgeoning bout of extreme weather. It is another to see a front rip through an entire community. Survivors are left reeling, building new lives amid the wreckage of the old.

Sequel to a Video Game Expands a Fresh Sony Franchise: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The anticipated game, Ghost of Yotei, will follow a woman on a quest for vengeance in the snowy reaches of northern Japan.
Even before Ghost of Tsushima won players over with its samurai protagonist and cinematic flair inspired by Kurosawa films like "Yojimbo," its designers felt confident enough to start planning a sequel.
On Tuesday, Sucker Punch Productions announced Ghost of Yotei, the beginning of an official franchise that will include at least one movie and other spinoffs, putting the series alongside emblematic Sony PlayStation titles like God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn.
Nate Fox and Jason Connell, creative directors on Ghost of Tsushima, had long envisioned a spiritual successor to the 2020 game, which brought players to the periphery of the Japanese shogunate period, with the Mongol invasion of the country's Tsushima Island in the 1200s. Critics applauded the game's historical accuracy, and the players who bought 13 million copies eagerly speculated about a sequel.
An initial trailer for Ghost of Yotei, which is scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 5 next year, describes the game's setting as "beyond the edge of Japan" with an imposing image of Mount Yotei from what is now the country's northern Hokkaido region. After snowy scenes of battle and bloodshed, a woman named Atsu emerges, bowing to a wolf companion and looking ahead toward an unseen expanse.
"When we started working on a sequel, the first question we asked ourselves is 'What is the DNA of a Ghost game?"' Fox said. "It is about transporting the player to the romance and beauty of feudal Japan."
Inspiration for the new game's setting came during two research trips into northern Japan. The Sucker Punch team, which mostly resides in Washington State, visited more than a dozen locations. But it was the image of Mount Yotei reflected across Lake Toya that inspired awe.
"I sat there for two hours just staring at the mountain," Connell said of the active stratovolcano, which is similar in appearance to Mount Fuji. "It was stunning."
Fox said another highlight was Shiretoko National Park on the northeastern tip of Hokkaido, which he visited to record nature sounds for his audio team.
"Inside the park, you have to watch a video telling you about the dangers of bears," Fox said. "Being in this incredibly beautiful park with jagged cliffs and water, yet all the time being aware there were dangerous bears, was electrifying."
"We strive to bring that into the video game -- that feeling of danger."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Without going into detail, the developers said Ghost of Yotei was a story of "underdog vengeance" that followed Atsu as she moved through the natural landscape, including sprawling grasslands and snowy tundras. They said players would have greater control over her story than in the previous game.
"One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again," said Connell, noting that players would be able to master firearms in addition to melee weapons like the katana. "We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences."
When Ghost of Yotei arrives, it will join a crowded thematic space.
The action-adventure franchise Assassin's Creed is releasing its own take on feudal Japan in February, and the Emmy-dominating television series "Shogun" is set in the 1600s when the Tokugawa shogunate dominated most of Japan but struggled to control Hokkaido. (Fox considers himself a fan of the television show and the book it was based on; his dog, an Australian labradoodle, is named Lord Toranaga after a main character.)
The sequel to Ghost of Tsushima is the linchpin to a series of tightly choreographed efforts by Sony to transform the series into a larger entertainment franchise. A cinematic version of the original game has been in development for several years under Chad Stahelski, who directed the "John Wick" films.
In recent years, game companies have achieved some critical and commercial success by turning their characters into Hollywood stars. The second-highest-grossing movie of last year was "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," which celebrated Nintendo's mascot and earned more than $ 1.3 billion at the box office. The year before, a movie based on Sony's Uncharted games made about $ 400 million.
Hermen Hulst, the chief executive of Sony's studio business group, said developing intellectual property across entertainment formats would drive customers back to the original games. "We saw the same with 'The Last of Us' on HBO," he said.
"From a business perspective it makes a lot of sense," Hulst said. "When a television series or movie comes out, people are inspired to play again or make friends to play."

Nintendo Follows the Path of Originality: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Shigeru Miyamoto has been making the same request of all new employees at Nintendo for at least the past decade: For the love of all things Super Mario, please design games that might sell 30 million copies.
The request for smash hits that can generate upward of $ 1.5 billion sounds almost reasonable coming from Miyamoto, a smiling septuagenarian with arched eyebrows and a trove of beloved cultural properties that would make Walt Disney blush.
Despite creating mascots like Super Mario, Princess Zelda and Donkey Kong that have earned billions for Nintendo, Miyamoto dresses like a humble salaryman, wearing company merchandise beneath his blazer. He has consulted on dozens of games and was instrumental in the development of the Wii and Switch consoles, but in recent years has focused on the movies and amusement parks that Nintendo hopes will undergird its future.
"I actually don't know why I create the things I create," Miyamoto said through an interpreter during a private interview this week. "I'm just having fun and that is what drives me."
He was speaking from inside the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto, Japan, an exhibition hall that opens on Oct. 2 and documents the company's evolution from a local storefront selling handmade playing cards in the 1880s to a video game company nearly a century later.
Unsurprisingly, the museum is mostly dedicated to that second chapter, which opens on Miyamoto's arrival at the company. (His father, an English teacher from the Kyoto suburbs, had arranged an interview with Nintendo's president at the time, Hiroshi Yamauchi.) Four years later, in 1981, Miyamoto made himself essential by inventing the Donkey Kong arcade cabinets, which introduced an early version of the character Mario and became an international hit.
"Mr. Yamauchi back in the day would tell us that we are not good at fighting: 'We are weak -- so don't go picking fights with other companies,"' Miyamoto said, explaining the company's longstanding pursuit of originality.
He shared that goal with Gunpei Yokoi, the inventor of the Game Boy, who worked with him on Donkey Kong. The working relationship was initially distant. "We talked and he provided feedback," Miyamoto said. "Some critical feedback, as well." But the colleagues grew close: Yokoi was a witness at his wedding, and Miyamoto said he remained in contact with the inventor's widow.
Following the path of originality has defined Miyamoto's work on recent Nintendo consoles and, by extension, the company's counterintuitive approach to an industry largely driven by expensive graphical realism.
"It might seem like we are just going the opposite direction for the sake of going in the opposite direction, but it really is trying to find what makes Nintendo special," Miyamoto said. "There is a lot of talk about A.I., for example. When that happens, everyone starts to go in the same direction, but that is where Nintendo would rather go in a different direction."
The museum itself represents the third and latest chapter of Nintendo's history: its transformation from a video game company into a global entertainment brand. Through concrete and nostalgia, Nintendo is declaring -- perhaps for the first time -- that it sees itself as a permanent fixture in popular culture.
Just a decade ago, industry analysts believed that Nintendo's only chance of survival after the failed launch of the Wii U was to stop producing consoles and focus on software development. The press was brutal. "What the Hell Is Wrong With Nintendo?" asked the Wired editor Chris Kohler. In 2013, Bloomberg News published an article pointing out that Sony and Microsoft "each sold more consoles in 24 hours than the Wii U maker did in nine months."
For the first time in its modern history, Nintendo -- the first part of its name, "Ninten," translates to "leave luck to heaven," a gambling prayer -- was reporting annual financial losses to investors.
A branding decision to piggyback off the name and considerable success of its previous console, the motion-controlled Wii, left the market confused. Buyers were later outraged when the console released with impaired functionality, which led the company's president at the time, Satoru Iwata, to issue an apology.
No Wii U game came close to Miyamoto's 30-million-copies metric of success. The highest-selling title, Mario Kart 8, sold 8.46 million units.
At the museum on the outskirts of Kyoto, however, the Wii U is represented with pride alongside the Super Nintendo, the GameCube and the rest of the company's console lineup: enshrined on the second floor.
Oddities crowd the corners. A toy rifle and a baby stroller are saved for a back display subtitled as the company's "age of exploration." The language is more direct in Japanese, describing a period from the company's founding to as far ahead as into its video game era as the "age of challenge."
The museum has almost no written explanations and Nintendo is not providing guided tours, leaving visitors without the context to know that licensed games like Twister and an early partnership with Disney were among the steps that allowed the company to negotiate its own products onto Japanese shelves. Additional research is necessary to learn that the Famicom, the precursor to the Nintendo Entertainment System, was on the cutting edge of technology in 1983: an online adapter allowed users to check the weather, conduct banking and place bets on horse races.
Miyamoto said the lack of explanations would allow visitors to intuitively understand Nintendo. "We wanted to make sure that this is someplace that regardless of any language or cultural barrier, people can come to interact and understand," he said.
The company was revived by the Nintendo Switch in 2017. Initial games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild were critical and commercial successes. The coronavirus pandemic also coincided with the release of cozy games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which attracted casual players looking for a virtual taste of fresh air, or "essentially peace in electronic form," as one young player said. Both games exceeded Miyamoto's sales target by millions of copies.
Behind the scenes, Miyamoto was also enacting a strategic plan to extend the Nintendo brand to new audiences and revenue streams. He now sits on the company's board of directors but also holds the title of "Executive Fellow," which at another company might be seen as the chief creative officer who oversees the development of new products.
After years of ignoring the surge in mobile gaming, the company developed apps like Super Mario Run, which Miyamoto joked during a presentation with Apple could be played while eating a hamburger. (In what appears to be a subtle reference, the museum cafe's only main dish is burgers.)
Miyamoto was also making trips to Hollywood to develop "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," which became the second-highest-grossing film of last year at nearly $ 1.4 billion. The movie released two months after the opening of Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Hollywood, the second of four planned theme parks around the world. Now there is a Mario movie sequel planned for release in 2026 and development work on a Zelda film.
How the company will evolve into a media brand is on Miyamoto's mind, especially as he considers broadening the museum to include more archival records, past console prototypes and artistic drawings.
"If we get to a point where we make 10 movies, maybe we can open a theater next door," Miyamoto said during a news conference at the museum.
It is no surprise that the Nintendo Museum takes some of its design cues from the cotton-candy amusements that will delight children. Floating question blocks and singing Toads native to the Mushroom Kingdom of the Mario games are spread throughout the museum property -- a sterile building from 1969 that originally housed a manufacturing plant for playing cards before it was repurposed in 1988 as a customer service center for product repairs.
The museum offers other interactive experiences, including the chance to paint versions of the company's original playing cards. In another section, visitors can use comically large controllers to play old Nintendo games; extend a mechanical arm to grab balls; test their love matches with partners; and swing a cushioned bat around a fake living room.
These exhibits allow Nintendo, which declined to say how many employees worked at the museum, who managed it or what it cost to renovate the building, to keep the finer points of its history wrapped in mystery.
Today's audiences recognize the company brand through its riotous colors and cheerful designs; even the company's logo is painted the same vivid color as Mario's red cap. But its Kyoto headquarters are shockingly sterile, housed inside a white rectangular office building with an interior design that Miyamoto has lovingly compared to a hospital waiting room.
There are many tourists who travel to Kyoto to marvel at the nondescript building, even as the pagoda roofs of 800-year-old shrines like Tofuku-ji temple tower in the distance. Some Nintendo officials hope those tourists will now flock a few train stops away to the museum instead, though the company remains torn between discretion and transparency.
"When I put myself in the consumer's perspective, I kind of want to see behind the curtains," Miyamoto admitted at the news conference.
"Creating a museum like this is very un-Nintendo-like," he added. "If Mr. Yamauchi saw this, he would probably say don't do it."

Magic Formula Helps a Princess Blaze Her Own Path: [Review]

Full text: Princess Zelda's magic wand can make a copy of nearly everything in the game, offering inventive solutions to enemy encounters and environmental puzzles.
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom finds us once again in the imperiled medieval fantasy world of Hyrule. This time, a mysterious force has been creating disastrous rifts that suck buildings and people alike into a dark and mysterious void. You start by fighting through a dungeon as Link, the protagonist of every previous Legend of Zelda game, but your time with him is brief.
For the first time, Princess Zelda takes on the mantle of hero.
Working with a diminutive yellow orb named Tri, Zelda sets out to repair the many rifts across the game's midsize open world and to restore Hyrule to its previous idyll. How she accomplishes this task is what makes Echoes of Wisdom special.
Tri gifts Zelda with a magic wand that allows her to manipulate the environment in various ways. Not only can she grab distant objects and move them around -- a mechanic familiar to those who have played recent Legend of Zelda titles like Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom -- she can also make an echo, or copy, of nearly everything in the game's world.
Whether it's a shrub or a clay pot, a block of ice, a plushly quilted bed or a sword-swinging Moblin, little lies beyond the reach of Zelda's copy-pasting powers. It's endlessly fun.
Instead of the familiar sword-and-shield gameplay that defines the franchise, Zelda can bring a bevy of creative solutions to encounters with enemies. She can throw a murder of crows at them; freeze them with an Ice Keese; set fire to the environment with a crawling Torch Slug; or simply pick the offending monster up with the wand's tractor beam and drop it off the nearest cliff.
The magic also makes for fascinating and inventive solutions to the game's many environmental puzzles. You can use stomping blocks as steppingstones to reach higher platforms. You can extend liquid bridges across chasms or choose to be carried over on a Flying Tile. You can stack up a pile of beds until you've made a very ugly, if perfectly functional, stairway. It's powerful magic that makes for refreshing gameplay.
Each area provides fresh monsters and environments, like cold zones with meltable walls and underwater areas with swift currents to navigate, that you may employ your smorgasbord of echoes against. The game's default level of difficulty is forgiving, and gives you plenty of space to experiment before finding a solution that clicks in an interesting or downright goofy way. Though Zelda is given access to Link's weapons over the course of the game, it's often far more entertaining to spawn in monsters or environmental features and discover what kind of surprising effects they may have.
Tri and its globular allies employ a similar magic on a much grander scale. They can bring whole castles, town squares, temples and lakes back from the void known as the Stilled World, and return them whole cloth to their original sites. It's a strange effect. Doubly so thanks to the top-down, toy-ified aesthetic of Echoes of Wisdom, whose round-cornered, zoomed-in diorama look was established by the 2019 remake of Link's Awakening.
Everything in Echoes of Wisdom fits precisely on its own tile, with a predetermined depth and height. In one of the early rift-healing sequences, you watch as an ally of Tri plops down a cookie-cutter tree on the right side of a house and floats offscreen only to immediately return and blink out of nothingness a perfectly symmetrical twin on the house's opposite side. It feels like watching a developer build out a section of the map in real time.
Everything is seemingly interchangeable, everything is seemingly an echo of an echo. And that gives the impression that very little in the world actually has any substance or bespoke meaning. Since Zelda can zap and hoover up nearly everything, it becomes confusing at times knowing which objects are real and which are the temporary echoes.
This confusion fits with the approach Nintendo has always taken with its Legend of Zelda games, which, unlike its Mario or Metroid series, are less a linear narrative with plot beats than an endless retelling of the same heroic journey using relatively blank-slate characters.
The games try, through their text, to sell themselves as mythological stories, slotting their main characters into fate-determined archetypes: the hero and the priestess of legend. The actual details of the plot are largely arbitrary and unimportant. The same sorts of monsters, the same villages, the same side characters dutifully making an appearance before trotting away. When King Rhoam enters, I recognize his character from Breath of the Wild. He feels unspecific to Echoes of Wisdom, more a token that moves the plot forward than Zelda's father with personal motivations.
Echoes of Wisdom muddles things even further by inserting the question of whether these characters are real or false echoes; in the story, they often appear as impostors masquerading as the originals.
There's a certain irony here in light of how aggressively Nintendo pursues cases of copyright infringement. It has a long history of sending takedown notices to makers of fan-made games and recently filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the developers of Palworld, whose characters and mechanics resemble ones from the Pokémon franchise.
When it comes to the characters and mythology underlying its worlds, Nintendo maintains a remarkably iron grip. But within that protected space, it tends to provide players with a surprisingly flexible and experimental sandbox. How precious, after all, can Nintendo be about the lore of The Legend of Zelda when, in Echoes of Wisdom, you can plop down a bed right in the middle of a pitched battle and take a power nap to regain your lost hearts? Or spawn a flaming brazier next to a living snowman, sit back and observe the macabre spectacle of it melting into a puddle?
Other long-running series like Final Fantasy reset their stories in each incarnation, but they each feature new characters with specific relationships to their unique worlds. With Zelda, you get the same Hyrule, the same Kakariko Village nestled under Eldin Volcano, the same Mount Lanayru, the same sandstorm-swept Gerudo Desert. There is just enough specificity to feel familiar and untouchable at the same time.
Echoes of Wisdom uses Hyrule as a platform upon which to experiment and explore, and it's quite successful in this respect. But this Hyrule is not a place that lets me emotionally connect to its characters, or see them as anything more than elaborate toys to pick up and plunk around.
While piloting my own tiny Zelda, who dons adorable outfits and spins elegantly, swinging her ponytail about in a flourish, I have fun re-enacting the storied myth. This time there are some spooky twists and existential turns as beloved figures are drained of color and life before her eyes and drawn into the malevolent Stilled World.
I can't help but wonder, though, what Echoes of Wisdom might look like if it took the same experimental ethos in its gameplay and applied it to its iconic characters. Nintendo would do well to rescue them from the timeless void of its immobile legacy, not to be employed as flat archetypes, but as real, living characters who might better stand apart from decades of history.
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will be released for the Nintendo Switch on Thursday.

KYOTO, Japan — Shigeru Miyamoto has been making the same request of all new employees at Nintendo for at least the past decade: For the love of all things Super Mario, please design games that might sell 30 million copies.
The request for smash hits that can generate upward of $1.5 billion sounds almost reasonable coming from Miyamoto, a smiling septuagenarian with arched eyebrows and a trove of beloved cultural properties that would make Walt Disney blush.
Despite creating mascots like Super Mario, Princess Zelda and Donkey Kong that have earned billions for Nintendo, Miyamoto dresses like a humble salaryman, wearing company merchandise beneath his blazer. He has consulted on dozens of games and was instrumental in the development of the Wii and Switch consoles, but in recent years has focused on the movies and amusement parks that Nintendo hopes will undergird its future.
“I actually don’t know why I create the things I create,” Miyamoto said through an interpreter during a private interview this week. “I’m just having fun and that is what drives me.”
He was speaking from inside the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto, Japan, an exhibition hall that opens Oct. 2 and documents the company’s evolution from a local storefront selling handmade playing cards in the 1880s to a video game company nearly a century later.
Unsurprisingly, the museum is mostly dedicated to that second chapter, which opens on Miyamoto’s arrival at the company. (His father, an English teacher from the Kyoto suburbs, had arranged an interview with Nintendo’s president at the time, Hiroshi Yamauchi.) Four years later, in 1981, Miyamoto made himself essential by inventing the Donkey Kong arcade cabinets, which introduced an early version of the character Mario and became an international hit.
“Mr. Yamauchi back in the day would tell us that we are not good at fighting: ‘We are weak — so don’t go picking fights with other companies,’” Miyamoto said, explaining the company’s longstanding pursuit of originality.
He shared that goal with Gunpei Yokoi, the inventor of the Game Boy, who worked with him on Donkey Kong. The working relationship was initially distant. “We talked and he provided feedback,” Miyamoto said. “Some critical feedback, as well.” But the colleagues grew close: Yokoi was a witness at his wedding, and Miyamoto said he remained in contact with the inventor’s widow.
Following the path of originality has defined Miyamoto’s work on recent Nintendo consoles and, by extension, the company’s counterintuitive approach to an industry largely driven by expensive graphical realism.
“It might seem like we are just going the opposite direction for the sake of going in the opposite direction, but it really is trying to find what makes Nintendo special,” Miyamoto said. “There is a lot of talk about AI, for example. When that happens, everyone starts to go in the same direction, but that is where Nintendo would rather go in a different direction.”
The museum itself represents the third and latest chapter of Nintendo’s history: its transformation from a video game company into a global entertainment brand. Through concrete and nostalgia, Nintendo is declaring — perhaps for the first time — that it sees itself as a permanent fixture in popular culture.
Just a decade ago, industry analysts believed that Nintendo’s only chance of survival after the failed launch of the Wii U was to stop producing consoles and focus on software development. The press was brutal. “What the Hell Is Wrong With Nintendo?” asked Wired editor Chris Kohler. In 2013, Bloomberg News published an article pointing out that Sony and Microsoft “each sold more consoles in 24 hours than the Wii U maker did in nine months.”
For the first time in its modern history, Nintendo — the first part of its name, “Ninten,” translates to “leave luck to heaven,” a gambling prayer — was reporting annual financial losses to investors.
A branding decision to piggyback off the name and considerable success of its previous console, the motion-controlled Wii, left the market confused. Buyers were later outraged when the console released with impaired functionality, which led the company’s president at the time, Satoru Iwata, to issue an apology.
No Wii U game came close to Miyamoto’s 30-million-copies metric of success. The highest-selling title, Mario Kart 8, sold 8.46 million units.
At the museum on the outskirts of Kyoto, however, the Wii U is represented with pride alongside the Super Nintendo, the GameCube and the rest of the company’s console lineup: enshrined on the second floor.
Oddities crowd the corners. A toy rifle and a baby stroller are saved for a back display subtitled as the company’s “age of exploration.” The language is more direct in Japanese, describing a period from the company’s founding to as far ahead as into its video game era as the “age of challenge.”

Miyamoto was also making trips to Hollywood to develop “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” which became the second-highest-grossing film of last year at nearly $1.4 billion. The movie released two months after the opening of Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Hollywood, the second of four planned theme parks around the world. Now there is a Mario movie sequel planned for release in 2026 and development work on a Zelda film.

Nintendo and Pokémon File a Patent Lawsuit
Nintendo and the Pokémon Company on Wednesday filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the video game company that developed Palword, a game with cute creatures that resemble the characters in Pokémon, except they use military-grade weapons.
Palworld became one of the most popular games in the world when it was released in January. It had been promoted for three years before that, and the trailers for it inspired memes and other forms of mocking by people who thought the game looked like an apocalyptic version of Pokémon.
Palworld's makers have repeatedly draw distinctions between Palworld, which is a survival game, and Pokémon, where players collect monsters and battle.
On Thursday, the Pokémon Company and Nintendo, a joint owner of the Pokémon Company, said in a statement that the companies had filed a suit in Tokyo District Court against the maker of Palworld, Pocketpair. The suit accuses Palword of violating "multiple patent rights" and seeks compensation for damages, according to the statement.
Pocketpair, which is based in Tokyo, said in a statement on Thursday that it did not know the details of the companies' claims. "At this moment, we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details," the statement said.
Pocketpair said that the success of Palword had been a surprise and that the company would continue doing work to improve the game. AMANDA HOLPUCH

GE Vernova Downsizing Offshore Wind Business
The energy company GE Vernova said on Friday that it would pare back its troubled offshore wind business, which has been hit with financial losses and accidents. The changes, which are aimed at coping with a difficult environment for the wind industry, could result in around 900 job losses.
The company's struggles are a blow to the offshore wind industry, which is a major source of electric power in northern Europe and is thought to have potential to supply large volumes of green energy to the East Coast of the United States.
A substantial downsizing of GE Vernova would leave just two main western players, Siemens Gamesa of Germany and Vestas Wind Systems of Demark -- a situation that could leave the industry short of construction capacity and could push equipment prices higher, raising consumers' bills.
GE Vernova, a spinoff from the venerable General Electric industrial conglomerate, said it had presented a proposal on Thursday for reducing the company's size to its European Works Council, which represents its workers, a necessary step before job cuts.
The company said in an emailed statement that its new plan reflected "industrywide challenges for wind" and aimed to create "a smaller, leaner and more profitable business."
The company declined to specify which countries' operations would be hit hardest.
A leader in land-based wind turbines, GE Vernova hustled to develop a giant turbine called the Haliade-X for offshore deployment, spending $ 400 million. STANLEY REED

The Mystery of Freeware Inspired the Creation of UFO 50: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Figuring out the controls, objectives and how to win is part of the fun when players load games from a fictional 1980s company.
There are many reasons that creating a video game can take a long time. It may take a while to land on the mechanics, or to nail the story beats. For big-budget games, the sheer scale of ambition and world building can cause development cycles nearly a decade long, during which shifting audience trends may force a developer to scrap its initial vision.
For UFO 50, which began its development in 2016, the protracted path to completion is right there in the name: It is not just one video game, but 50.
There are arcade-style sports games (Bushido Ball, Hot Foot), platformers (Cyber Owls, Mini & Max), puzzle games (Block Koala), deck builders (Party House), role-playing games (Grimstone) and dungeon crawlers (Valbrace). While each '80s-style title is not necessarily feature length by modern terms, they're fully built out, with narratives, multiple levels and multiplayer modes when appropriate.
UFO 50's origins can be traced to the childhood of two of its designers, Derek Yu and Jon Perry, who have known each other since second grade. Perry said they were inspired by the scrappier, freeware era of early PC gaming.
"Derek's dad used to get these disks that would have like a ton of different old PC games on them," he said, "and I remember going to Derek's house and seeing a list of titles on a DOS prompt." There was a sense of mystery and exploration in, he said, "typing in the title of some weird game that was made by one guy and just not knowing what you were going to get."
That feeling is recreated in UFO 50. Before each game loads, the player gets almost no information other than its title. Figuring out the controls, objectives and how to win is part of the puzzle.
Players might open a simplistic arcade racing game like The Big Bell Race, or Fist Hell, a beat-'em-up, and immediately understand what they are looking at. Or they might stumble on Avianos, a more complicated turn-based strategy game in which you pray to dinosaur gods for different effects on the battlefield.
Perry said Yu once described the library itself as an open-world video game, comparing the daunting aspects of some UFO 50 games to being under-leveled in an R.P.G.
"It's like you wandered into a big cave on the map with the two hard enemies that you weren't supposed to go into yet, and maybe you circle back to that later," Perry said.
As teenagers, Perry and Yu spent hours using Klik & Play, a no-code video game development tool that is now defunct, to create games for each other. They worked on a freeware title, the side-scrolling action-adventure Eternal Daughter, that was released in 2002 under the label Blackeye Software. Afterward, Perry moved into tabletop gaming while Yu went on to release indie video games including the acclaimed Spelunky.
When they eventually circled back to talk about making video games together again, Yu suggested that Perry tinker with a piece of software, GameMaker, that was reminiscent of Klik & Play.
Making a title like UFO 50 was a chance to flex long dormant muscles.
"We really enjoyed the process of making fairly small games," Yu recalled. "Eternal Daughter took a couple years, but we also released a lot of games that just took a couple weeks or a couple months."
Perry and Yu brought on Eirik Suhrke, and later Paul Hubans and Tyriq Plummer, to round out the team. Each game had its own director, although everyone pitched in where needed. (An additional title, Seaside Drive, comes from the designer Ojiro Fumoto, while Hubans revived a long-gestating idea to direct the point-and-click adventure Night Manor.)
That openness to ideas is a large part of the project appeal for designers like Suhrke, whose games vary from the self-explanatory Warptank, centered on a tank that can teleport between the floor and the ceiling, and Mooncat, an unwieldy platformer. "That's the game where specifically I did not want to have saving," he said of Mooncat. "I wanted you to have to sit through that journey."
Tying the collection together is a metanarrative about the fictional company, UFO Soft, that put out all of these games in the 1980s. Each game, presented in the menu in fictional release order, has fictional credits and little bits of trivia attached to it, while the real developers are credited as the "recovery team" who found the games in an abandoned storage locker.
UFO 50 tells many small stories and a larger one about what game development looks like over the span of years.
There are subtle evolutions -- the first game in the chronology, Barbuta, is much sparser graphically than the last, Cyber Owls -- and some games even have sequels. The Campanella trilogy introduces a Nintendo-like cast of characters who also appear in other titles, like Pilot Quest. In Mortol, players use their own corpse to move through levels; Mortol II: The Confederacy of Nilpis expands the cast of sacrificial archetypes.

Full text: In the Plucky Squire, a young hero fights a villainous wizard to become "the master of his storybook," says Jamie Turner, the co-director of the game.
Video games let their players accomplish many adventurous acts with a few taps of a button. Although one of the richest aspects of a game can be its story, many players skip over that in the interest of completing their quest. But what if toying with a book was the heart of a game -- and a bridge between Zelda-like heroics and a reader's imagination?
The Plucky Squire, released Tuesday, suggests that the video gaming pen may very well be mightier than its sword, and it does so in a stealthy manner that might guide gaming kids (and gaming kids-at-heart) back to the imaginative potential of illustrated books.
In this game, a villainous wizard named Humgrump realizes he's trapped inside a children's book, and has flipped ahead to learn that he's destined to lose to you, a hero named Jot. With a wave of his wand, he ejects you from your comfortable, hand-drawn confines and into the massive, overwhelming bedroom of a real-life boy, Sam. Jot's initial quest is to return to his storybook world and defeat Humgrump, but after jumping into and out of the real world multiple times, his purpose changes in surprising ways.
The Plucky Squire exploits its book-within-a-game conceit to joyous extremes. A player can manipulate the words in the book to change the environment, by having Jot, for example, dislodge an object near a mouse by adding the word "cheese" to the description, or jump out of the book, then pick up its pages to shake out obstacles, or run around Sam's bedroom, then jump into and out of his fan-art sketches to get the edge on Humgrump.
In video game parlance, Jot jumps from 2-D to 3-D, but in storytelling terms, it's more universal. "Jot is the master of his storybook," Jamie Turner, the Plucky Squire co-director, said in a video interview. "When he gets kicked out, we've made sure it's not an exciting thing straight away. He's been this amazing main character up until this point, and now he gets set back to zero."
This experience mirrors life for Turner, who left his hometown, London, in his early 20s for Japan to pursue a dream of making video games. "That was jumping out of one dimension and into another," Turner, who founded his own studio in 2022, said. "I couldn't speak the language. I was in a completely different world."
Turner and his co-director, Jonathan Biddle, said their childhoods resembled the relationship between the hero character, Jot, and Sam. "The big thing when I was a kid was the Mario versus Sonic kind of stuff, and that inspired me to draw my own game characters at an early age," Biddle said. For Turner, "imagining what might happen if the character was real, and what happens if the character could leave that book," was the appeal. His experience reading picture books with his son inspired him to draw a children's book concept, which morphed into the Plucky Squire.
Sophie Blackall, a children's book author and illustrator, has never played a video game, yet she admits to optimistic curiosity about the Plucky Squire's concept. "Being pushed out of a book is such a childhood experience," Blackall said, noting that children are encouraged to read more advanced books before they are ready. "There's an assumption that picture books signal immaturity; if you're reading a book without pictures, then you're a better, more sophisticated reader."
Blackall also appreciates the game's steps between dimensions as a way to "guide a kid in this act of taking a leap, leaving your comfort zone, and finding skills and experiences that can make you better equipped to deal with the things that are happening in your life."
As an advocate for the accessibility of physical books -- something that can be shared between adults and children without requiring a screen -- Blackall suggests that anyone intrigued by the Plucky Squire's concept should consider the subgenre of interactive, meta-narrative picture books, including "Press Here" by Hervé Tullet and "It's a Book" by Lane Smith.
Ultimately, the medium matters less to Blackall than the relationship surrounding it: "The kids who are lucky enough to have parents who are engaged and present in their lives and curious about the media they're consuming, and can talk about it together, is a very different thing from controlling the media that a child consumes."
The Plucky Squire has already engendered serious engagement for at least one family. "The voice of Jot is actually my son," Turner said, and his son has also doubled as Turner's admittedly unpaid prerelease game tester -- who, among other things, has helped Turner tune the game to an ideal elementary-and-up age recommendation (though like any good kids' story, it can scale well for adult fans).
"I'll just sit next to you and make notes," Turner said to his son. "You get to enjoy the game, and I get a bit of useful feedback."

A Season of Culture, Celebrated Over 92 Pages: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Arts & Leisure's fall preview connects readers with the season's noteworthy cultural works. And there are many.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In the spring, Andrew LaVallee starts planning for fall.
As the editor of The New York Times's Arts & Leisure section, he is constantly considering the cool, crisp season, when Broadway stages new performances, galleries open much-anticipated exhibitions and new TV series are released on streaming services, all shaping cultural conversation and impassioned debate.
Months of planning culminate in the Arts & Leisure fall preview, an annual section that shares with readers the can't-miss cultural works of the season.
This year's section, which appears in print on Sunday, includes the work of about 70 journalists. Across 92 pages, 45 articles, five covers and 11 art forms, including theater, film, dance, podcasts, books and video games, The Times shares the best of what fall has to offer.
Planning begins in earnest in April. But for LaVallee, the content is "on my mind all year round."
"Really early in the year, or even the year before, you're starting to hear about, say, Robert Downey Jr. is going to be in his first Broadway show in the fall," LaVallee added. "I'm starting to bookmark things like that in my brain."
In this year's preview, there's an article on a Broadway revival of "Romeo and Juliet," a discussion with the filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar and a piece on the actor Daniel Dae Kim and his long-anticipated return to the stage.
Readers will also find music critics' picks from pop (Chappell Roan) to classical (Wagner's "Ring" cycle) to rap (Sexyy Red). There's a panoply of exciting upcoming releases to write about, too, including art exhibitions, TV shows, even video games. (In the new Legend of Zelda, Princess Zelda is finally a playable protagonist.)
There are reviews and roundups aplenty, but longer pieces put buzzy works into larger cultural conversations. In an article on Demi Moore and body politics, for example, The Times's chief film critic Manohla Dargis asks readers to consider Moore's career, and her history of baring it all onscreen, in a wider context.
When LaVallee and a handful of editors first sat down to brainstorm the behemoth of a section, they wondered: What movies would invite debate? Which plays would draw the biggest crowds? Would any new TV series keep viewers glued to their screens?
So begins the mapping of the plans, which, of course, change along the way.
"There's plenty of heartbreak," LaVallee said. "Things just inevitably don't work out. And so you're always going to regroup."
And then there is the massive art effort. The editors commissioned 19 photographers, and five illustrators, for the project. They pored over roughly 2,389 images, including photographs from the shoots, archival works and publicity stills. (Just south of 200 made the final cut in print.)
"The first thing we want is variety," said the photo editor Jolie Ruben. She also wanted to ensure that a photo "could work with a certain crop and type on it, and be a strong enough image" to engage a reader.
They wanted the images to be artistic, but subjects in "cover" photos needed to be easily identifiable. Amanda Webster, a photo editor, pointed to the pictures of the actress Margaret Qualley, one of the five "cover" stories, as examples.
"There are some, where the photographer was playing with projections and Margaret was moving and they were a little bit more abstract, that are so beautiful," Webster said. But the image the team selected was simple, arresting: A moody shot of Qualley looking off camera.
"We really put a lot of time and effort into our photography," added Jennifer Ledbury, the section's art director. "We try to let those have as much play as we can." In July and August, Ledbury and Felicia Vasquez, another editor, began to think in earnest about how to display articles and images in relation to one another.
Despite months of prep work, the final days before the section goes to press are always stressful. Copy comes in just under deadline; photos need last-minute toning. Hours are spent fine-tuning the layouts and typeface arrangements. Then, at the push of a proverbial button, the pages are sent to the printing plant to be brought to life.
LaVallee said he felt confident the team had chosen a diverse range of voices to feature in the preview, offering readers a window into culture across the globe.
"I really tried to make it something that all different kinds of readers can find something interesting in," he said. "Stories that appeal to people who are New Yorkers and people who are elsewhere in the country, in the world, readers of all different ages and types."
He hopes Times readers can slip into the section this Sunday, that the content helps them escape into another world -- or, reconsider something about the one they already reside in.

Full text: The calendar brings a Legend of Zelda game with Zelda in charge, an Assassin's Creed set in Japan and new role-playing games.
The video game industry will generate headlines galore next year if Grand Theft Auto VI is released as planned, but there is enough to keep fans busy as 2024 winds down.
Venerated franchises are granting fan wishes -- Assassin's Creed is heading to Japan, and The Legend of Zelda is focusing on the series' namesake -- and several notable developers are debuting projects. It will be tough, though, for these upcoming titles to compete with Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, Hades II, Animal Well and others for game of the year recognition. (Some games will be available before their official launch dates because of early-access programs.)

Everything Is Go for Astro Bot: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Astro, a babylike robot designed to show off the power of PlayStation hardware, has graduated to his own full-length adventure game.
If PlayStation's next big character succeeds, it will be in part because he is a really, really cute little guy.
Astro, the babylike robot at the center of the new video game Astro Bot, has charmed his way from an asset in a technology demonstration for Sony to leading one of the best-reviewed titles of the year.
Establishing a video game mascot requires a particular alchemy of elegance and identity. Succeed and land among Nintendo heavyweights like Mario and Kirby. Fail and, well, even Bubsy has a Wikipedia page.
Nicolas Doucet, the creative director of Team Asobi, which developed Astro Bot, used his hands during a video interview to emphasize how Astro's large, expressive blue eyes and compact physicality were vital to his appeal.
"I think part of it is the simplicity of the design," Doucet said. "We've kept things simple on purpose."
Doucet said Astro's current look came from the technical limitations of hardware in 2013, when the robot was introduced in The Playroom, an augmented reality tech demo for the PlayStation 4 that saw a bevy of bots swarm players in the "real" world.
A 2016 follow-up did the same with The Playroom VR, a version of the earlier demo but for the company's virtual reality headset. Then came Astro Bot: Rescue Mission, in 2018, a well-received early title on the PlayStation VR, but one that is not available to play on the current generation of the hardware. In 2020, Astro arrived with Astro's Playroom, a preinstalled title on PlayStation 5 that also served as a tech demo for the DualSense controller's capabilities like delicate haptic feedback rumbling and granular trigger sensitivity.
But after several cameos, Astro Bot is the character's biggest opportunity to assert his identity in the canon of video game mascots. Astro's lack of lore as he heads into his first real adventure is a benefit, Doucet said.
"On purpose we're not growing a back story that is very, very precise so that, as a character, you can continue being flexible," he said. "We can take Astro wherever we want."
Strangely enough, his less-than-glamorous origin story makes him a strong fit for that canon. Kirby, the beloved character who is simply a pink circle with a face, arms and feet, started his life as placeholder art.
Katherine Isbister, a professor of human computer interaction at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the author of "How Games Move Us: Emotion by Design," said Astro's uncomplicated origins were a strength. There is no temptation to deviate from the simple appeal of his design.
"If you consciously try to design the ideal cute character, you can wash away all the uniqueness out with careful market testing," she said. "But something someone sketches that's appealing, that's kind of bubbling up from their subconscious, it can clear those design-by-committee gates."
Astro's design strength, Isbister said, is that though he is a robot, he is also a baby. If his huge head and little body do not fully cement that impression, Astro walks around the game world with a full toddler waddle as he recovers the missing parts of his spaceship, collects coins and jumps on trampolines decorated with his face. The DualSense controller uses vibration technology for players to feel every tippy-tap.
"If something looks like a baby, we're sort of hard-wired to think it's cute and want to take care of it," Isbister said.
PlayStation titles are not typically identified with their cuter protagonists (apologies to Sackboy, a previous cute mascot from the LittleBigPlanet franchise that is no longer a representative for the company). Gamers are primed instead to think of the pithy treasure hunter Nathan Drake from Uncharted, the postapocalyptic found family Joel and Ellie from The Last of Us and, well, a god of war from God of War.
Those characters are all so defined that the player is locked within a set personality, Isbister said. But every player can identify with a character like Astro.
"Something that's really photorealistic, that's hyperdetailed feels more like an 'other' person to us, where something like this character that's very simple allows projection of the self," she said.
Astro's universality goes beyond his looks. Doucet said the robot's sound effects, his chirps and squeals as he hops around, were designed so a child could easily replicate them.
Whether Astro will become a legacy character remains to be seen, but he has made an early impression on children, with fan art making its way to Doucet after Astro's Playroom. Before Astro Bot was released, Doucet said, he heard from the parents of two young Brazilian girls who could not wait for the game.
"That's the real fuel," he said. "That's what makes us feel good."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: About 150 PlayStation characters, including the dragon Spyro and the cylinder-headed prince from Katamari Damacy, make appearances in a paean to Sony's legacy.
Astro Bot, a generally exceptional, imaginative game, features a heroic robot with pixelated eyes of blue who waddles tentatively through the universe like a toddler. But Astro is an ardent puzzle-solver, too, in a game that is a mammoth, interactive pop culture history.
Astro previously appeared in a tech demo for the PlayStation 5 that showed off the bells and whistles of the new Sony console and its controller. That tidbit was fun, but Astro Bot contains a fuller, 12-hour experience. It uses the PS5 controller to an impressive extent, emitting thousands of sounds and good vibrations. It's not an exaggeration to say I felt like I was holding an extension of Astro Bot in my hands.
The simple sci-fi rescue story by Team Asobi works despite the fact that the only decipherable language comes via eye expressions and verbal exclamations. Astro's delightful, whooping laughter recalls Curly's harried vocalizations in the vintage black-and-white short comedies of the Three Stooges.
Asobi means "play" in Japanese, and Astro Bot evokes so many versions of play from pop culture's annals that it's somewhat like Steven Spielberg's version of "Ready Player One." About 150 PlayStation characters make appearances, including the dragon Spyro and the cylinder-headed prince from Katamari Damacy.
Astro Bot can feel like some Nintendo or Sega games. Like Super Mario Galaxy, it includes scores of planets. As in Pikmin, the little beings work together; on your home base, they combine to make a bridge held by a pelican's beak. Climb across and you'll enter an area inspired by Sony's Horizon series. Even an old board game, the Rube Goldberg-style Mouse Trap, is evoked on a level in which the white-and-blue Astro shrinks to a gnawer's size.
Some might think of this as way too much borrowing. I prefer the Newton-esque "standing on the shoulders of giants" idea because Astro Bot, startlingly, becomes its own thing.
Astro's ship, a towering, rocket-powered PlayStation 5, has been attacked; when it crashes, its crew is strewn across galaxies. Ingeniously, the controller becomes a smaller jet, the Dual Speeder, which is even playable on a usually static pregame screen. By piloting the jet and streaking through multicolored portals in space, Astro finds as many as 300 minuscule members of his crew on 50 planets and asteroids. On the Trunk of Funk planet, which features a huge smiling tree, a Bot is hidden in a bird's nest. Sometimes they're trapped in cages. Sometimes it's hard to find all of them in a level.
More than just acting as the Dual Speeder, the controller uses haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to immerse players in these worlds. Handy-D, a banana-eating monkey in your backpack, climbs walls with long, Mr. Fantastic-like hands and arms as you tilt the device. When you press a trigger, Astro lofts rocks at a giant, peg-legged pirate boss with a dinosaur's head as a foot. (The controller works less effectively when used as a hammer.) Later, when I jumped on two mushrooms near a tree, the fungi felt spongy and emitted a sound like wet sod after a rain.
Some tech is more familiar. Of the soundtrack's 87 songs, none is more memorable than Kenneth C M Young's short and poppy "I Am Astro Bot," which is almost as catchy as David Byrne and Fatboy Slim's hook in "Here Lies Love."
Astro Bot does have a marketing gimmick that can be annoying if you're not a self-promotion-minded streamer or influencer. A trope among platformers is the collection of gold coins; here, they're exchanged to unlock Astro's wardrobe variations or animated Bots that populate the home base. The coins are branded with the PlayStation logo, an advertisement that appears thousands of times. Some might say this exhibits pride in one's employer. To me, it's overkill.
Beyond that hiccup, Astro Bot is an enjoyable endeavor that often showcases the brilliance of game makers who know their history. They iterate so inventively that you feel as if you're part of something mildly revolutionary.
With the game's expected success, Astro, who must be considered the PS5's mascot in the way Crash Bandicoot was the original PlayStation's mascot, will be imitated widely and promoted even more aggressively as the holidays approach. Already, you can buy a cute Astro-branded controller. He has become a star among the planets.

Full text: I'm a national correspondent based in Rhode Island, covering guns and culture in the United States after covering the war in Ukraine for the international desk. My tastes are a mix of mope-rock, video games that don't give me seizures and movies that you wake up thinking about. Here are five things I've watched, read or played recently. THOMAS GIBBONS-NEFF GODZILLA MINUS ONE FILM I'm not a monster-movie guy, but anything that looks at postwar Japan, especially through the filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki's eyes, feels important. I was not disappointed. Godzilla was a great foil for an enduring trial of war: how to come home. And of course one of the last lines was among the best: "Is your war finally over?" NOTHING GOOD HAPPENS IN WAZIRABAD ON WEDNESDAY BOOKS After my colleague and one of the best storytellers I know, Mujib Mashal, posted a photo of this book on Instagram, I knew I was going to read it. The novel, by Jamaluddin Aram, takes place in Afghanistan in the early 1990s. It provides an intimate look at a confusing time that still echoes today across the country. BLOOD TYPE SONG This 1988 song by the Soviet band Kino is about a soldier in Afghanistan who, in so many words, is asking not to die in some faraway place. It hits harder now as I reflect on my time in Afghanistan, especially as a Marine. It's a reminder that these similar feelings of futility in war are enduring. ANIMAL WELL VIDEO GAMES After Hollow Knight and its overwhelming map and multiple endings sank almost a year of my life, my quest for another Metroidvania of similar size and scope remained unfinished (though the Ori games were close). But I think Animal Well, with its sparse story, delightful graphics and many hidden puzzles, is on its way to closing that gap. METAL GEAR SOLID 3: SNAKE EATER VIDEO GAMES I borrowed my friend's PlayStation when this first came out, though the game is (thankfully) now on Nintendo Switch. When I was in Ukraine in May, before a serious interview that ended up in a McDonald's (that's a whole other story), I booted up the first chapter. "Commencing Virtuous Mission," Snake drawled, and I was hooked once more.

Full text: NHL '94 and MVP Baseball 2005 live on decades later. So do the arcade-style games NBA Jam and Mario Tennis.
When we asked readers to share their memories of their favorite sports video games, the responses included 8-bit classics from the 1990s and cooperative brawls played with gesture-controlled joysticks some two decades later. Many of these were played with close friends or family, huddled around the TV.
For many readers, these games were an outlet for sports dreams that were otherwise inaccessible. Frustrated by the Kansas City Royals' shortcomings? Throwing a perfect game with Zack Greinke in MVP Baseball 2005 was the ultimate catharsis for one reader. Skate 3 comprises an entire city full of skate spots that carry no risks of getting bullied or reprimanded.
They also found plenty to love beyond the on-field action, from customizing their apparel and environments (Tony Hawk's Underground) to managing coaching staff contracts (Football Manager). Many deem their favorite game's soundtrack "iconic."
Here are some of the sports video games our readers love, listed with the platforms they primarily played them on:
Arcade Style
There was an especially prevalent love for "arcade-style" games that prioritized ease of play, approachability for non-sports fans and stylistic flash.
NFL Street 2 (2004, Xbox)
A game that rewards constant showboating, excessive trash talk and ruthless aggression opened the door for one's imagination to be fully realized toward the most fun aspects of pickup football. The over-the-top aesthetic includes hilarious gamebreaker cut scenes, outrageous animations for jukes and spin moves, stylish outfits and absurdly proportioned physiques.
-- Connor Sen Warnick, 28, New York
NBA Street Vol. 2 (2003, Xbox)
Images of bygone eras of basketball culture, elevated into the realm of myth by the game's cartoonish presentation, filter through my mind's eye. Dr. J squares off against Michael Jordan on the bubblegum-speckled blacktop and Wilt tangles with Shaq in graffiti-laden rec centers as streetballers and N.B.A. legends alike soar through the air and clash above the rim. It's like a delirious SlamBall version of "Field of Dreams," an exaggerated playground legend passed around by word of mouth.
-- Colten Fortenbaugh, 30, Millerstown, Pa.
Mario Tennis (2000, Nintendo 64)
Mario Tennis on the Nintendo 64 struck just the right balance of accessibility -- like in Virtua Tennis, it's very rare to aim a shot outside the court -- and authenticity. People often talk of "realism" when discussing sports video games, but they are usually focusing on the way the game looks or the way the onscreen characters are animated to imitate their real-life counterparts. What Mario Tennis had instead was tennis authenticity.
-- Pedro Manaças, 45, Lisbon
Mario Super Sluggers (2008, Wii)
Mario Super Sluggers captures the whimsy and fantastical fun of a video game while still honoring the traditional and competitive nature of baseball. It's a timeless classic that I love to play with friends.
-- Ben Remis, 24, Los Angeles
NFL Blitz 2000 (1999, Nintendo 64)
I'm not a huge sports fan, but the Blitz games were a lot more arcade styled than they were simulator styled, so it was just fun to see all the goofy stuff you could do. You didn't need to know football strategy, and the players didn't have very realistic physics like they do in the modern games, so you could pull off some goofy plays.
-- Henry Schrader, 28, Lafayette, Ind.
NBA Jam (1994, Super Nintendo)
The two-versus-two setup allowed for fast-paced, frenetic play. The exaggerated slam dunks were over the top in the best possible way. And who could forget the memorable shouts of "He's on fire!" and "Boomshakalaka!" from the in-game announcer?
-- Robert Wyllie, 41, Portland, Ore.
Nontraditional Games
A sports game doesn't have to reflect a mainstream sport like football, basketball or baseball to be beloved. In fact, sometimes the game doesn't even have to focus directly on the on-field action. Titles like International Track & Field and Football Manager find the fun in the lifestyle around sports.
theHunter: Call of the Wild (2016, Xbox)
I moved to a hunting game because it wasn't all action, all the time. The game calms me down. Slowly moving through a wooded forest or other well-designed landscapes is a way to get outside in an indoor setting. When you actually have to shoot a creature, it adds to my game experience even though I am not a hunter in real life.
-- Scott Wolf, 53, Dublin
Football Manager 2017 (2016, PC)
It's unmatched in terms of the in-depth experience offered to the players. From managing Under-21 coaching staff contracts, selecting preseason tours around the world to grow your marketing, choosing individual training plans for your reserves, spending hours poring through databases looking for the perfect rotation fullback, telling the groundskeeper the field dimensions -- it's more immersive than you'd think.
-- Peter, 28, Philadelphia
Rockstar Table Tennis (2006, Wii/Xbox 360)
It's a lovingly simulated version of table tennis that faithfully represents the interactions of spin, speed and paddle rubber rather than simply batting the ball with flat trajectories back and forth. You can chop, loop and smash, all with very smooth animations that Rockstar is known for.
-- Dan L., 29, New York
Rocket League (2016, PC)
It has a practically infinitely high skill ceiling, a lot of room for creativity and feels satisfying to play. There are short matches, almost no luck and a good balance between mechanical and game sense requirements.
-- Luca, 21, Germany
International Track & Field (1999, Game Boy Color)
At first glance it is a by-the-numbers minigame collection featuring abstractions of track-and-field events, but it also contains a novel life-sim/R.P.G. campaign that you really didn't see too often. The game required you to plan your week's routine, juggling exercises to increase your aptitude in different events while managing the character's stress, stamina, job(s) and qualifying event schedules.
-- Jameson Wilkins, 37, Tampa, Fla.
Early-Era Games
The popularity of sports games dates back to the release of the Atari 2600 in 1977. Soon, with the Nintendo Entertainment System, many 8-bit titles (Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, Tecmo Super Bowl) would prove enduringly popular.
NHL '94 (1993, Super Nintendo/Sega Genesis)
The leap in gameplay here was astronomical over previous hockey games. Along with real N.H.L. players, who were included for the first time, the custom organ music made this the most iconic and replayable game of all time. There is still an active NHL '94 community out there.
-- Raphael Frydman, 45, Cranford, N.J.
I help organize the NHL '94 world championship tournament each year, called the King of 94. Bringing middle-aged men together from all across North America to play our favorite game for a weekend is an absolute blast!
-- Darrell Sampson, 47, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan
RealSports Baseball (1982, Atari 2600)
The one thing that was really fun was that you could throw physics-defying pitches whose path was as crazy as your ability to wield a joystick. To make contact you had to practice an almost zen-like focus.
-- David Filipi, Columbus, Ohio
Sensible Soccer (1992, Amiga)
It comes from a time where you could just pick up and play -- it wasn't designed to eat up your whole life or dominate your time. It also reminds me of when multiplayer games were played by multiple people in the same room looking at the same screen.
-- Jonathan Riggall, 47, Barcelona, Spain
Tecmo Super Bowl (1991, NES)
I learned so many players' names and became a fan of the Dolphins (Mark Clayton and Mark Duper) and Redskins (Gary Clark, Art Monk, Ricky Sanders, Mark Rypien) simply from playing the game constantly. Seeing where you stood in season stats was always fun (need to run more!). Such simple gameplay.
-- J.J. Warren, 39, New York
Playing as Yourself
One common joy of video games is that they often allow you to build yourself, your alter ego or even imaginary worlds to live out sports fantasies.
FIFA 2002 (2001, GameCube)
My friend and I used to rent FIFA 2002 from Blockbuster all the time in high school and play for hours on his GameCube. We were both on the high school soccer team so one time we recreated our entire team in the game using the character creation feature.
-- Daniel Connors, 36, Syracuse, N.Y.
Tony Hawk's Underground (2003, PlayStation 2)
You could dress your character exactly the way you wanted to, choose what skate brand you wanted to skate for after they all courted you, and customize all your gear -- options that were huge for me at a young age. It wasn't just about the actual sport of skateboarding with the Tony Hawk games. It was the music, the gear and the story lines that made it so special.
-- Charlie Franco, 30, New York
Skate 3 (2010, PlayStation 3)
We grew up biking and skating around a postindustrial Southern town, and when we weren't out and about, we would play Skate for hours. The idea of a huge city filled with spots to skate where you wouldn't get kicked out was pure teenage fantasy.
-- Barron D. Webster, 30, New York
Realism
And still, many consider the ideal sports game one that is an interactive extension of the TV broadcast. These games are the most grounded rendering of the sport's experience through graphics and game mechanics as well as an opportunity to dive into the nerdy minutiae of team management.
MVP Baseball 2005 (2005, PlayStation 2)
The features are still the high-water mark for baseball games. Pitching is perfectly simple. You select a pitch, place it in the zone, and then do a little bit of timing on the buttons to make it accurate (which becomes harder as your pitcher's arm tires). The Batter's Eye feature, where a pitch will turn a different color for a split second depending on if it's a slider, curve or two-seam is perfect, and one of the most rewarding experiences when it comes to hitting. The franchise mode is excellent: You can play every game for your organization down to Single A. Sign, trade, develop -- it has it all. As a long-suffering Royals fan, throwing a perfect game with prime Zack Greinke was the ultimate catharsis for a team that couldn't make it happen in real life. The game is simple yet complex, and is by far the most rewarding, well-polished sports video game I have ever played.
-- Ben Hanson, 24, Overland Park, Kan.
FIFA 2004 (2005, GameCube)
FIFA 04 had great soccer simulations and visual animations, updating the game with the off-the-ball control feature. Players felt the excitement of stadiums authentically as seen on the TV, recognizing the big players of the time and having the opportunity to see their favorites turn into champions.
-- Leticia Villalba, 27, Asunción, Paraguay
Madden 2004 (2003, Xbox)
I think I played 30 full seasons of franchise mode. At the time this was revolutionary, allowing you to control everything from long-term contract extensions down to the price of a hot dog. I have fond, extremely detailed memories of training camps spent boosting the stats of young running backs and linebackers. The soundtrack was also incredible. Just typing this out puts me back on that couch holding my wired controller, probably drinking orange soda. Oh yeah, and Michael Vick had 95 speed and the Falcons were outlawed in head-to-head games.
-- Calvin Cestari, 35, Boston
NCAA Football 14 (2013, Xbox 360)
The game's featured modes, Dynasty and Road to Glory, were deep and engrossing, challenging players to succeed on and off the field. The hectic world of college football does not stop on Saturdays, and Dynasty mode's coaching carousel and recruiting cycles could be as exciting as any fourth-quarter comeback. The on-field gameplay matched up, straddling the fine line between realistic and fun. Different play styles were viable, and personnel mattered. The satisfying gameplay loop meant many players have continued playing the game over a decade after its release.
-- Matthias Winsor, 26, Atlanta

How Twitter Got All Tangled Up in Blue: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: By Nov. 9, 2022, anxiety was high among the Twitter employees gathered at the company's San Francisco headquarters. They had spent part of that morning trying to gently explain to their new boss, Elon Musk, that the service they had just launched was dangerous.
Twitter Blue, a subscription service that now allowed users to buy one of the platform's coveted verified badges, had been live for only a few hours when Mr. Musk -- who had bought the company two weeks earlier and would later rename it X -- stepped out of the glass-walled conference room with views of San Francisco City Hall to speak with an assistant. With Mr. Musk out of earshot, the welcoming, deferential mood in the room immediately changed. The employees knew that users relied on the verified check marks to ensure that information on the platform -- including bus times or hurricane evacuation orders or a pop star's musings -- was indeed real.
"All these other people around the world rely on a label of some kind, a badge of some kind, to tell them this is the real account to listen to," said Esther Crawford, a director of product management, according to three people in attendance. "And they will be hijacked."
Christian Dowell, a company lawyer, chimed in, suggesting that accounts that bought the badges could start a harassment campaign, using the credibility of verification to, for instance, direct SWAT teams to people's homes. "Somebody could die, actually," he said.
When Mr. Musk re-entered the room, the chatter died. No one had expected him to be with them for so long on launch day, but he picked through the snacks -- at one point eating half a doughnut in a single bite. He encouraged employees who raised concerns to be "adventurous."
"We're going to be shooting from the hip in real time," Mr. Musk said, fashioning his hands into a pair of finger guns.
Previously, Blue had been a small part of the company's business, which relied on advertising for 90 percent of its revenue. Blue allowed a few thousand die-hard users to pay for premium features, like the ability to edit their tweets and customize the Twitter app on their phones, but it never gained much traction. To Mr. Musk, a Twitter obsessive who had purchased the company for $ 44 billion, the service represented an untapped financial opportunity.
Mr. Musk's attempt to rescue a company he saw as a sinking ship was premised on the idea that he could persuade people -- millions of them -- to pay for Twitter Blue. That scheme, however, was doomed from the start by the haphazard planning and capriciousness of Twitter's owner, whose nearly two-year stewardship of the company has cratered its finances and sullied his reputation as a generational entrepreneur.
During his time at the helm, Mr. Musk has cycled through periods of supreme confidence and self-doubt, making abrupt decisions only to reverse himself. The tumult of his takeover was exemplified in his handling of Blue, which he shut down the day after its unveiling, amid a torrent of criticism, but made available once again a month later. Since then, the site's check marks have become a hodgepodge of paid, free and fake identifiers signifying little more than confusion.
The book from which this excerpt is drawn is based on more than 100 interviews with people who worked at Twitter or for Mr. Musk. It also relies on internal company documents, contemporaneous notes, recordings and court records. Mr. Musk did not respond to requests for interviews for this book or this excerpt.
Mr. Musk's plan for Blue centered on selling Twitter's verification check marks as part of the subscription. The badge, which featured a check mark outlined in blue, was a status symbol on Twitter. In the past, the company gave them out at its own discretion, distinguishing high-profile accounts from impostors. Justin Bieber and Barack Obama had check marks, as did more than 420,000 other users.
Mr. Musk came to hate what he saw as Twitter's two-tiered class system of the verified and unverified, and to him, selling off the check marks was the ultimate democratization of the site. Soon after completing his acquisition, he assigned Ms. Crawford to assemble a team and gave her a deadline of Nov. 7, 2022, for Blue's relaunch. She had 10 days to deliver or risk being fired, three people with knowledge of the conversations said.
Many of the employees on the Blue team came to view the project as pointless at best and, at worst, something that could undermine trust. If everyone could be verified, then no one would truly be verified.
As one Blue worker later wrote in a journal: "It was such an obvious train wreck, that the main job of everyone on the team was to make sure it was the safest train wreck possible."
The Check Mark
Before the introduction of verified check marks in 2009, impersonation on Twitter was pervasive. While the company's founders knew it was a problem, cracking down on accounts masquerading as those belonging to famous people was always a secondary concern as the company struggled to keep the site online as it constantly crashed from growth.
In 2009, Tony La Russa, the World Series-winning manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, became fed up with a parody account that made jokes about unsavory team incidents -- including the death of one of his players -- and sued Twitter. In response, Twitter took down the impostor and rolled out a solution: verified accounts.
The company began slapping the blue seal on the accounts of notable people and organizations, becoming the first social network to verify its users -- one of its most lasting impacts on internet culture. Other services began verifying prominent users, including Google+ in 2011, Facebook in 2012 and Instagram in 2014.
While many people saw the check mark as a designation of fame, it became an important part of Twitter's utility. It marked the real accounts for brands like McDonald's and Coca-Cola, making the platform much more attractive to advertisers. And it signified authenticity for governments and emergency services, which provided information about train delays, elections and tornado warnings.
Among those impersonated on early Twitter was @ElonMusk. Mr. Musk, who had been pushed to try Twitter by his first wife, Justine Musk, initially dismissed the microblogging service and her constant use. When the impostor vacated the @ElonMusk handle and Mr. Musk took over the username in 2010, the entrepreneur rarely posted. "Not sure I can handle just doing 140 char missives," he tweeted in late 2011, frustrated by the character limits on tweets.
But Mr. Musk's Twitter habit grew as he realized the site's power. It gave him a way of keeping everyone updated on the progress of his companies, Tesla and SpaceX, and pushing back against media outlets, which he had come to distrust. On the platform, he owned his own narrative.
By early 2022, he was secretly acquiring Twitter stock, blazing past a limit set by the Securities and Exchange Commission to prevent investors from quietly accumulating major stakes in public companies. That April, Mr. Musk made an offer to buy Twitter for $ 54.20 a share, eager to own his favorite megaphone. He waffled over the decision that summer and tried to call the deal off, but Twitter's board sued him to force it through. By Oct. 26, Mr. Musk had accepted the terms and marched into Twitter's San Francisco headquarters with a vision for Blue.
'Power to the People!'
For Ms. Crawford -- who had arrived at Twitter in 2020 after it acquired Squad, her video chat start-up -- Blue represented an opportunity. In private meetings, she told those working with her on the project that there was limited possibility for success, three people who were part of those discussions said. But she saw it as a chance to impress Mr. Musk and gain influence.
"This is our chance to show the best of what Twitter has to offer," Ms. Crawford told her team. If they could accomplish this task now, she suggested, they would be able to negotiate for what they wanted later, including raises, new positions and new products.
Still, the absurdity of being asked to launch a product built to Mr. Musk's specifications in less than two weeks, amid widespread layoffs, was not lost on her. In one meeting, she presented her team with customized mugs that wouldn't have been out of place at a tech-themed Bed Bath & Beyond. "Chance made us co-workers, crazy psycho [expletive] made us Tweeps," read the mugs' inscription.
Ms. Crawford and her team tried to develop safeguards. On Oct. 31, they presented options to Mr. Musk and his retinue of investors and friends. In one version of the system, there would be two badges: People who were already verified would keep their blue badges, while those who paid for the subscription program would get a different badge, this one in white.
To illustrate the differences, they created mock-ups of two tweets. One, from the legacy verified @JoeBiden account, advised people to vote. The other, from the Blue-subscribed @JoeB1den account, which replaced the "i" with a "1," tweeted that it was "starting nuclear war with Russia." Besides the slight change in spelling, the two accounts could be distinguished by their colored badges.
The attempt to make clearer distinctions between legacy and paid verified users, however, was not embraced by Mr. Musk's friends. It "feels like a second-class citizen," David Sacks, a venture capitalist who was assisting with the takeover, wrote in an email seen by The New York Times, adding that it would "disincentivize purchase." Eventually, Mr. Musk vetoed the move.
Mr. Musk's fixation on Blue extended beyond the design, and he engaged in lengthy deliberations about how much it should cost. Mr. Sacks insisted that they should raise the price to $ 20 a month, from its current $ 4.99. Anything less felt cheap to him, and he wanted to present Blue as a luxury good.
"Chanel could make a fortune selling a $ 99 bag, but it would be a one-time move," he wrote. "A 'promotional offer' may not be the position we want. A luxury brand can always move down-market, but it's very hard to move up-market once the brand is shot."
Jason Calacanis, a friend of Mr. Musk's, disagreed. "It should be $ 99 a year," he insisted. During one meeting, he launched into a spiel about how Twitter users were more likely to open their wallets for a $ 100-per-year subscription if it seemed slightly cheaper at the $ 99 price, as though he had just watched a YouTube video explaining the basics of consumer psychology.
Mr. Musk also turned to the author Walter Isaacson for advice. Mr. Isaacson, who had written books on Steve Jobs and Benjamin Franklin, was shadowing him for an authorized biography. "Walter, what do you think?" Mr. Musk asked.
"This should be accessible to everyone," Mr. Isaacson said, no longer just the fly on the wall. "You need a really low price point, because this is something that everyone is going to sign up for."
To employees, the discussions were baffling. There was Mr. Musk, a man who had built multibillion-dollar companies, soliciting advice from a small inner circle of advisers who had little experience building social networks. Sure, they used Twitter, but these rich men were not representative of the hundreds of millions of people who logged in every day.
Mr. Musk had largely come to peace with a price of $ 100 a year for Blue. But during one meeting to discuss pricing, his top assistant, Jehn Balajadia, felt compelled to speak up.
"There's a lot of people who can't even buy gas right now," she said, according to two people in attendance. It was hard to see how any of those people would pony up $ 100 on the spot for a social media status symbol.
Mr. Musk paused to think. "You know, like, what do people pay for Starbucks?" he asked. "Like $ 8?"
Before anyone could raise objections, he whipped out his phone to set his word in stone.
"Twitter's current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn't have a blue checkmark is bullshit," he tweeted on Nov. 1. "Power to the people! Blue for $ 8/month."
'We Need to Protect the Mission'
Ms. Crawford grew closer to Mr. Musk, texting with him regularly, and members of his inner circle started opening up to her. Ms. Balajadia sat Ms. Crawford down to coach her on managing Mr. Musk. Ms. Balajadia was one of the few women Mr. Musk trusted, and while her title was "operations coordinator" for the Boring Company, his tunneling start-up, she was treated as a glorified assistant. She monitored his calendar, shadowed him at events and set up his laptop for him when Mr. Musk needed to do work that couldn't be done on his iPhone.
"I can tell you're going to be around for a while, so let me tell you something," Ms. Balajadia said to Ms. Crawford. "Elon is special in this world. It is our job to protect him and make sure what he wants to have happen, happens. We need to protect the mission."
Ms. Crawford came up with her own tactics for dealing with Mr. Musk. She quickly learned that she could challenge him in one-on-one settings. Individually, Mr. Musk could be charming, willing to engage in discussion and listen to the expertise of his counterpart. Put him in a larger group setting with people outside his inner circle or those he didn't trust, however, and Mr. Musk's ego ran wild. He could never be seen as inferior or uninformed.
In a meeting days after the acquisition, Mr. Musk was tuning out a discussion about product ideas and scrolling Twitter. After reading a tweet about the F.B.I. and Hillary Clinton -- a constant fixation for the right-wing accounts that he began to interact with more frequently -- he announced to the room that he had drafted a tweet about Ms. Clinton, hoping to elicit laughs.
"You can't do that right now!" Ms. Crawford said, standing up. They had product matters to discuss, and she didn't want a distraction. Then she burst out laughing. Her histrionic approach worked.
"Are you my tweet adviser now?" Mr. Musk asked, raising an eyebrow. He didn't send the tweet.
Publicly, Ms. Crawford was seen as a cheerleader. Through the chaos of the takeover, she remained outwardly optimistic, giving others the impression that she had become Mr. Musk's devotee.
One night, after working long hours with the Blue team, she and her colleagues decided to tweet a joke. She had brought an eye mask and a silver REI sleeping bag to the office for nap breaks, and a product designer, Evan Jones, had snapped a photo of her sleeping. Later, she asked him to retake the picture and post it. He climbed on some office furniture to get a better overhead angle of her in the sleeping bag, then tweeted the photo. Ms. Crawford then retweeted it with her own message: "When your team is pushing round the clock to make deadlines sometimes you #SleepWhereYouWork."
The image rocketed around the internet. To Mr. Musk's detractors, it symbolized the cringe-worthy hustle culture that dominated the tech world. To his supporters, the photo showed the impact that a once-in-a-lifetime innovator was having on a company that needed a revolution. In reality, it was a shrewd bit of self-promotion.
Ms. Crawford and Mr. Jones faced a maelstrom of criticism across Twitter, and the product designer wanted to delete his post. But she demanded that he keep the photo up. This was her time to shine.
An F.B.I. Inquiry
The hustle wasn't completely fake. The Blue team stayed up late fielding requests from Mr. Musk and his transition team, and created a 24-hour rotation where projects could be passed to other employees around the globe.
Some people on the Blue team had taken to monitoring their elevated heart rates on their Apple Watches and sharing the metric with their colleagues to make light of their situations.
"I don't want to push the team to die over this," Ms. Crawford told Mr. Musk at one point, trying to warn about burnout.
"Well, push them to just before they die," Mr. Musk responded, laughing.
As the new Blue came into focus, so did the fears about how it would be exploited for impersonation. What would happen if an account pretending to be a local fire department declared an emergency? Or an account posing as a politician spread a lie about an upcoming vote?
Stopping election interference was of paramount importance to Twitter employees. Brazil, one of Twitter's largest markets outside the United States, held its presidential runoff election the weekend after Mr. Musk walked into Twitter. The incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, was unseated by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva but immediately said he would challenge the results. Twitter employees who worked on civic integrity gamed out situations in which Mr. Bolsonaro, whom Mr. Musk claimed to sometimes speak with, could spread disinformation using paid verified accounts.
The F.B.I. also raised concerns about the U.S. midterm elections, which were set for Nov. 8. About a week before Election Day, an agent from the agency's Foreign Influence Task Force reached out to the company to better understand its plans for Blue.
Mr. Musk was briefed on the outreach during a Nov. 3 meeting and was told that the F.B.I. was interested in whether there would be changes to currently verified state or federal government election accounts, according to three people with knowledge of that conversation. The agency also asked whether fraudulent accounts posing as government officials would be able to become verified.
Mr. Musk's response didn't exactly breed confidence. He wanted to push ahead with the launch of Blue before the election, but wait to make some changes, including a plan to give tweets from Blue subscribers greater reach on the platform.
Mr. Musk also said he planned to give a separate "official badge" to all government entities "of significance" to indicate that they were authentic accounts. But he didn't define what he meant by "of significance." Employees knew it was impossible to filter through the thousands of verified accounts that could potentially deal in official U.S. elections and determine if they should receive "official" billing, just days before the vote. (Mr. Musk later killed the effort.)
"Why are we making such a risky change one day before elections, which has the potential of causing elections interference by malicious groups that could abuse the new rules to their advantage in the spread of misinformation?" one employee wrote on a companywide Slack channel.
The weekend before U.S. voters headed to the polls, Ms. Crawford made one last attempt in a private chat with her boss. "Do you want to be blamed for the outcome of this election?" she asked.
"Well, when is it?" Mr. Musk replied.
"It's in two days," Ms. Crawford said, stunned that he hadn't clocked the date that she and her team had been warning him about since the start of the project.
Mr. Musk paused, processing. "Oh, I didn't realize," he said after a moment. "OK, yeah, it's fine. We can wait. Why don't we wait?"
The launch was moved to Nov. 9, the day after the election.
'A Little Bit of Confusion'
On the morning of Nov. 9, Mr. Musk joined the Blue launch team in the conference room overlooking the city, according to three people who attended the meeting. The engineers and designers in the room straightened up.
"There are a whole bunch of people dying to show what a huge idiot I am," Mr. Musk said. He decided to keep the launch quiet, worried that a press announcement would lead to an overload of Twitter's systems.
Still, he expected people to sign up in droves. "It's better to have a little bit of confusion reign for a soft launch so we don't break the system," he told employees. And he was worried about bad actors, predicting a wave of impostors and scammers that would be like a "zombie attack" in "World War Z," the 2013 action horror flick starring Brad Pitt.
For more than six hours, Mr. Musk kept a watchful eye as users began to notice the service and spread the word. This was his game-changing Twitter service, one that he believed would wean the company off its dependence on advertising, and he was there to shepherd it through, like the liftoff of a SpaceX rocket. He warned the team against taking drastic actions like adding more labels or pausing the service.
"We should consider what is the magnitude of the thing that happens before we take action," Mr. Musk said. "I want to pay close attention and react with agility, but not react with a fear of a thing that may or may not occur."
A software engineer calling in to the meeting posed a question to Mr. Musk: "What would you consider a serious incident that would require us to put back such a label or some other differentiation between accounts?"
Mr. Musk intertwined his fingers and paused for a few seconds.
"If there's like death or serious injury or something like that, um, you know, uh," he said, fidgeting. "Something beyond annoyance or mild confusion -- that would be enough."
Turning It Off
By that evening, more than 78,000 users had signed up for Blue.
But many were impostors: One user pretended to be the video game company Nintendo and then shared an image of Mario, the lovable plumber, giving the middle finger. The fake verified accounts caused so much confusion that the stepmother of Kyrie Irving, the basketball superstar, called Twitter's Partnerships Team to get the company to take down a tweet from an account spoofing an ESPN reporter that claimed the Brooklyn Nets had released him.
Then came the election meddling. Some results were still being tallied, including in the hotly contested Arizona governor's race between Katie Hobbs, the Democratic secretary of state, and Kari Lake, a Trump-backed Republican who had offered to welcome Twitter if Mr. Musk moved the company to the state. With Ms. Lake half a percentage point behind in the vote count the day after the election, a fake account with a new verified badge purporting to be hers tweeted, "It is with heavy heart that I must concede to my opponent, @katiehobbs."
On Nov. 10, major advertisers started to ring Twitter's sales team, telling it that they would pull their ads unless the company did something about the fakes. In one call, executives from Nike threatened to never advertise on the platform again, two people with knowledge of the conversation said.
Those who saw Mr. Musk after these calls could sense his tension; he was clearly bothered by the threats from business leaders. By that afternoon, his jovial mood after launching Blue the previous day had disappeared. And over the coming weeks, Mr. Musk's mood swings -- one moment despondent, the next energized -- would become routine.
The threats stirred Mr. Musk's fear of losing hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue in a snap. "Turn it off," he told an engineer in the San Francisco office. "Turn it off!"

On a Detour But Still On the Way: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Anthony Tan was 16 when his idea for a video game about a deer caught the industry's eye. Nine years later, he's still working on it.
Anthony Tan's hands shook as he took his seat in a dark Los Angeles theater. The neon green lights sporadically illuminated the 7,000 faces around him.
Tan, a solo video game developer, was just 20 years old. Yet a trailer for his game, Way to the Woods, was about to share screen time with dozens of other coming Xbox titles, including those from mega-franchises like Gears of War and Halo. Unlike those games, created by teams of hundreds with eight- or nine-figure budgets, Tan had built his alone in his spare time, buoyed by grant funding.
By the time he sat down in the theater at Microsoft's annual hype-building event, in June 2019, Tan had watched his trailer more than 100 times. He knew every note, every camera pan. As the lights dimmed and the screen faded to black, he was too nervous to look. Everyone else watched his game's stars -- a deer and a fawn -- appear onscreen, pushing a railway handcar across a golden plain.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Even before the event was over, Tan's phone blew up with Twitter messages from strangers. Millions of people had been watching the livestream online. Some praised the game's art style, which Tan said was inspired by the Studio Ghibli movies "Princess Mononoke" and "Spirited Away"; others were intrigued by its unusual main characters.
Tan was now shaking from adrenaline, not nerves.
"It was absolutely exhilarating," he said.
Tan's game about animals navigating an abandoned world had struck a chord. The final seconds of his stylish, mysterious trailer made a promise, or as close to one as the world of video game development allows: "Coming 2020 ... for real this time."
More than five years later, and nine years after it was conceived, Way to the Woods remains unreleased. It has been so long that even steadfast supporters have begun to speculate that Tan may have abandoned the game altogether. But Tan wants you to know it is still coming. It is just that on the journey, he got lost for a little while.
'It Was a Facade'
Tan was born in Australia and grew up inside, and around, Melbourne's public housing Towers. His mother, Thanh, and father, Khuong, immigrated from Vietnam in 1994. His older brother was born the same year.
Tan's father would regale him with harrowing stories from his own youth: He broke out of prison after having been detained by the North Vietnamese during the war. He survived pirate attacks on refugee boats. His own father was a spy.
But for much of Tan's childhood, Khuong was in and out of hospitals for dialysis and surgeries because of diabetes. The indie video games that Tan was drawn to -- Limbo, a suffocating 2-D platforming puzzle game, and Journey, where you control a nameless robed figure's trek to a distant mountain -- were melancholic and contemplative, dealing with loneliness and isolation but touching on companionship and hope.
Tan was designing games himself from a young age. Around 2009, when he was 10, he used Adobe Flash and RPG Maker, a development tool kit for role-playing games, to make solo projects filled with inside jokes and memes that made his friends laugh. The games took a few hours to create and could be beaten in minutes.
As he upgraded to Unity, a more advanced 3-D game engine, his concepts grew larger without deviating from their comic origins.
In 2014, Tan created a sequel to Modern Bugfare 2: The Desolation of Seinfeld, a role-playing game inspired by a cult film -- that comedian's "Bee Movie" -- and an absurdist Tumblr web comic. "It was this two-hour R.P.G. where you play as Jerry Seinfeld trying to get his human body back," he said.
When Tan posted two screenshots to Reddit showing a bulbous, frowning bee hovering inside a sunlit cabin, strangers online praised his work and provided tips to improve his technique. Some were envious that his jokey game looked better than their more serious creations.
One of those strangers was Alex Schwartz, the founder of the game studio Owlchemy Labs. Schwartz, who uses they/them pronouns, thought that Tan's work was "dripping with aesthetic" and that his 3-D modeling was "beautiful and soft." It was exactly the style they were looking for.
They offered Tan a job to help build 3-D models for a prototype that would become Job Simulator, a virtual reality title in which players take on everyday roles like office worker and auto mechanic. Tan was 15, in his third year of high school. His mother had to sign the work-for-hire contract.
While Tan worked for Owlchemy, he kept developing his own art, occasionally posting screenshots on DeviantArt and Reddit. One of his ideas -- a deer standing in front of a giant robot -- materialized in a dream. When he woke up, he sketched it out. He built it in Unreal Engine, a popular software development tool by Epic Games.
In late 2015, Tan dropped several screenshots of "a little game idea" into the Unreal Engine subreddit. The stills featured a deer in what seemed to be a building's abandoned restroom. Plants had started to grow through the tiles in the floor. The animal looked offscreen inquisitively or, perhaps, fearfully.
The post was spotted by Sean Murray, the lead developer for his own studio's hotly anticipated No Man's Sky, a sci-fi survival game in which players traverse a simulated universe containing billions of planets. When Murray posted on Twitter about Tan's work, it spread even further.
More than a million views and a feature on the culture website Polygon later, Tan's idea was officially on the map. Tan's parents were supportive but did not quite grasp just how much of a sensation he had become.
Tan was 16 and, at that point, Way to the Woods was not a video game at all. It was a series of beautifully rendered images that were no more playable than the Mona Lisa.
"It was a facade," Tan said. "It looks like something, but it isn't something."
There was no plot, no story line, no gameplay loop to keep players interested. There was a basic premise: Players would navigate the deer through a three-dimensional world devoid of human life, solving puzzles by capturing light in the larger animal's antlers and using it to clear away shadow.
But turning the painting into a bona fide video game would take work. A lot of work. "I was pretty ignorant at the time at how much work I needed to actually do," Tan said.
It is a fairly typical path into game development to take on a small, specific role as a contractor inside a larger studio and contribute to the whole. Watch the credit sequence in any multimillion-dollar video game like Call of Duty or The Legend of Zelda and you will see hundreds of names listed across design, art, music and testing.
As a solo developer, Tan's greatest challenge is acquiring and wielding the skills of an entire studio. It takes time to move from brush to pen to keyboard; from writer to artist to to programmer. The farming life simulation Stardew Valley, developed entirely by Eric Barone, took more than four years to put together. One of this year's indie success stories, Animal Well, was a seven-year odyssey for Billy Basso.
Schwartz said Tan's method for designing Way to the Woods -- starting with the visual aesthetic rather than the gameplay -- was unorthodox. When Schwartz provided advice after Tan left Owlchemy, they were surprised by his ambitious timelines.
"Every time I would talk to him," Schwartz said, "he's like, 'I'm about a year away."'
'It's About Wonder'
The buzz around Way to the Woods had sharpened Tan's doubts about the quality of his game. He wanted players to experience what he had experienced playing Journey. He so badly wanted to give them goose bumps -- he just wasn't sure how. He realized he was trying to please everybody.
"I didn't feel like I had anything authentic inside of me," Tan said. "I didn't know how to write anything. And I didn't know what I wanted to say."
But while Tan toiled over Way to the Woods, he was also growing up.
He was building the game's trailer in early 2019 when his father had to have a leg amputated. By that time, his parents had separated. As Khuong Tan was getting used to his new wheelchair and prosthetics, he tripped and fell in his apartment. The accident ended his life. When Tan discusses his father's death, he sounds almost incredulous. "It is so mundane," he said. "I thought it was kind of funny, like ... he survived pirates!"
Tan had been riding high ever since his breakthrough moment on Reddit. Way to the Woods had received funding from Epic Games, which makes Fortnite. He had caught the attention of Xbox's independent developer program, tapping into its vast resources. He had begun a new relationship.
But after his father's death -- just a month before his trailer debuted at the Xbox briefing -- and then the loss of a friend, Tan felt "paralyzed" and became hyperaware of his own mortality. He did not even know if he wanted to finish making the game.
As Tan weathered the emotional storm, he began thinking about the message he wanted to deliver. In 2020, he wrote the entire story of Way to the Woods while looking at a photo of his father.
Tan cannot remember exactly what his father was holding in that photo: an old cathode-ray monitor, a slab of beer, maybe something else entirely. There is a dreamlike quality to his recollection. But his father is smiling. The image inspired a sentimentality in Tan, an acknowledgment of his bond with his father and an appreciation for objects we often take for granted.
"These simple things are as fulfilling as the biggest thing you could possibly imagine," Tan said.
Way to the Woods is littered with relics of the world that came before, one inhabited by humans. Tan elevates the status of lamps, flip phones and, yes, bulky computer monitors, by making them central to the journey. He hopes the player will feel the sense of wonder and awe that the deer do when encountering these unfamiliar objects.
Tan also had to reconcile with parts of himself that he did not like. The teenager whose screenshots of deer had drawn so much attention was "irony-pilled" and "internet-memey," he said. He got introspective, expunging the kind of edgy humor you might find on the online message board 4chan but maintaining the playful, silly streak of his earlier games. Internet memes were out; a little more sincerity came in.
He was not interested in creating something ironic or melancholic. He was interested in joy.
"I tried so hard to make a meaningful, artistic, Journey-type experience," Tan said. "And I've just ended up back at 'I built some silly shit.' And that, to me, also feels more true and more meaningful."
Tan decided to lean into the giddy experience of traversing a world as an animal, one that could be seen as both majestic and ungainly.
The shift is acutely highlighted by the game's soundtrack. Aivi & Surasshu, the music duo behind the soundtrack for the TV series "Steven Universe," said its earliest draft for Way to the Woods had an oppressive tone. The pieces were more somber; the atmosphere pervading the game world more haunting. "Over time, both the game and the music started becoming more light," Aivi said.
Some fans lost hope as Tan publicized release dates -- 2019, 2020, 2023 ("pinky swear!") -- and then missed them, but he never lost the support of Microsoft. Chris Charla, the general manager of Xbox's independent developer program, said the company was understanding when independent studios announced delays. "Developers put themselves under enough pressure, and we're not interested in micromanaging ship dates," he said.
For Tan, the development journey led him all the way back to the beginning. He was making a video game with the sensibilities of the projects he used to craft in his bedroom. Or Modern Bugfare 3, with its soft lighting, whimsical textures and absurd attitude.
That is not to say his biggest project is insincere. "It's about care and it's about wonder and those feelings and finding ways for that to be told through these deer," Tan said. It is no longer trying to be something for someone else. Way to the Woods is all grown up.
Several months ago, Tan once again addressed the question hovering over him: When can people expect to play his deer game? He said he had recently crafted the ending and was working through a checklist of tasks. He was discussing release windows with publishers.
This time, he would not put a date on it.

MELBOURNE, Australia — Anthony Tan’s hands shook as he took his seat in a dark Los Angeles theater. The neon green lights sporadically illuminated the 7,000 faces around him.
Tan, a solo video game developer, was just 20 years old. Yet a trailer for his game, Way to the Woods, was about to share screen time with dozens of other coming Xbox titles, including those from mega-franchises like Gears of War and Halo. Unlike those games, created by teams of hundreds with eight- or nine-figure budgets, Tan had built his alone in his spare time, buoyed by grant funding.
By the time he sat down in the theater at Microsoft’s annual hype-building event, in June 2019, Tan had watched his trailer more than 100 times. He knew every note, every camera pan. As the lights dimmed and the screen faded to black, he was too nervous to look. Everyone else watched his game’s stars — a deer and a fawn — appear onscreen, pushing a railway handcar across a golden plain.
Even before the event ended, Tan’s phone blew up with Twitter messages from strangers. Millions of people had been watching the livestream online. Some praised the game’s art style, which Tan said was inspired by the Studio Ghibli movies “Princess Mononoke” and “Spirited Away”; others were intrigued by its unusual main characters.
Tan was now shaking from adrenaline, not nerves.
“It was absolutely exhilarating,” he said.
Tan’s game about animals navigating an abandoned world had struck a chord. The final seconds of his stylish, mysterious trailer made a promise, or as close to one as the world of video game development allows: “Coming 2020 ... for real this time.”
More than five years later, and nine years after it was conceived, Way to the Woods remains unreleased. It has been so long that even steadfast supporters have begun to speculate that Tan may have abandoned the game altogether. But Tan wants you to know it is still coming. It is just that on the journey, he got lost for a little while.
‘It Was a Facade’
Tan was born in Australia and grew up inside, and around, public housing here in Melbourne. His mother, Thanh, and father, Khuong, emigrated from Vietnam in 1994. His older brother was born the same year.
Tan’s father would regale him with harrowing stories from his own youth: He broke out of prison after having been detained by the North Vietnamese during the war. He survived pirate attacks on refugee boats. His own father was a spy.
But for much of Tan’s childhood, Khuong was in and out of hospitals for dialysis and surgeries because of diabetes. The indie video games that Tan was drawn to — Limbo, a suffocating 2D platforming puzzle game, and Journey, where you control a nameless robed figure’s trek to a distant mountain — were melancholic and contemplative, dealing with loneliness and isolation but touching on companionship and hope.
Tan was designing games himself from a young age. Around 2009, when he was 10, he used Adobe Flash and RPG Maker, a development tool kit for role-playing games, to make solo projects filled with inside jokes and memes that made his friends laugh. The games took a few hours to create and could be beaten in minutes.
As he upgraded to Unity, a more advanced 3D game engine, his concepts grew larger without deviating from their comic origins.
In 2014, Tan created a sequel to Modern Bugfare 2: The Desolation of Seinfeld, a role-playing game inspired by a cult film — that comedian’s “Bee Movie” — and an absurdist Tumblr web comic. “It was this two-hour RPG where you play as Jerry Seinfeld trying to get his human body back,” he said.
When Tan posted two screenshots to Reddit showing a bulbous, frowning bee hovering inside a sunlit cabin, strangers online praised his work and provided tips to improve his technique. Some were envious that his jokey game looked better than their more serious creations.
One of those strangers was Alex Schwartz, the founder of the game studio Owlchemy Labs. Schwartz, who uses they/them pronouns, thought that Tan’s work was “dripping with aesthetic” and that his 3D modeling was “beautiful and soft.” It was exactly the style they were looking for.
They offered Tan a job to help build 3D models for a prototype that would become Job Simulator, a virtual reality title in which players take on everyday roles like office worker and auto mechanic. Tan was 15, in his third year of high school. His mother had to sign the work-for-hire contract.
While Tan worked for Owlchemy, he kept developing his own art, occasionally posting screenshots on DeviantArt and Reddit. One of his ideas — a deer standing in front of a giant robot — materialized in a dream. When he woke up, he sketched it out. He built it in Unreal Engine, a popular software development tool by Epic Games.
In late 2015, Tan dropped several screenshots of “a little game idea” into the Unreal Engine subreddit. The stills featured a deer in what seemed to be a building’s abandoned restroom. Plants had started to grow through the tiles in the floor. The animal looked offscreen inquisitively or, perhaps, fearfully.
The post was spotted by Sean Murray, the lead developer for his own studio’s hotly anticipated No Man’s Sky, a sci-fi survival game in which players traverse a simulated universe containing billions of planets. When Murray posted on Twitter about Tan’s work, it spread even further.
More than a million views and a feature on the culture website Polygon later, Tan’s idea was officially on the map. Tan’s parents were supportive but did not quite grasp just how much of a sensation he had become.
Tan was 16 and, at that point, Way to the Woods was not a video game at all. It was a series of beautifully rendered images that were no more playable than the Mona Lisa.
“It was a facade,” Tan said. “It looks like something, but it isn’t something . ”
There was no plot, no storyline, no gameplay loop to keep players interested. There was a basic premise: Players would navigate the deer through a 3D world devoid of human life, solving puzzles by capturing light in the larger animal’s antlers and using it to clear away shadow.
But turning the painting into a bona fide video game would take work. A lot of work. “I was pretty ignorant at the time at how much work I needed to actually do,” Tan said.
It is a fairly typical path into game development to take on a small, specific role as a contractor inside a larger studio and contribute to the whole. Watch the credit sequence in any multimillion-dollar video game like Call of Duty or The Legend of Zelda and you will see hundreds of names listed across design, art, music and testing.
As a solo developer, Tan’s greatest challenge is acquiring and wielding the skills of an entire studio. It takes time to move from brush to pen to keyboard; from writer to artist to programmer. The farming life simulation Stardew Valley, developed entirely by Eric Barone, took more than four years to put together. One of this year’s indie success stories, Animal Well, was a seven-year odyssey for Billy Basso.
Schwartz said Tan’s method for designing Way to the Woods — starting with the visual aesthetic rather than the gameplay — was unorthodox. When Schwartz provided advice after Tan left Owlchemy, they were surprised by his ambitious timelines.
“Every time I would talk to him,” Schwartz said, “he’s like, ‘I’m about a year away.’”
‘It’s About Wonder’
The buzz around Way to the Woods had sharpened Tan’s doubts about the quality of his game. He wanted players to experience what he had experienced playing Journey. He so badly wanted to give them goose bumps — he just wasn’t sure how. He realized he was trying to please everybody.
“I didn’t feel like I had anything authentic inside of me,” Tan said. “I didn’t know how to write anything. And I didn’t know what I wanted to say.”
But while Tan toiled over Way to the Woods, he was also growing up.
He was building the game’s trailer in early 2019 when his father had to have a leg amputated. By that time, his parents had separated. As Khuong Tan was getting used to his new wheelchair and prosthetics, he tripped and fell in his apartment. The accident ended his life. When Tan discusses his father’s death, he sounds almost incredulous. “It is so mundane,” he said. “I thought it was kind of funny, like ... he survived pirates!”
Tan had been riding high ever since his breakthrough moment on Reddit. Way to the Woods had received funding from Epic Games, which makes Fortnite. He had caught the attention of Xbox’s independent developer program, tapping into its vast resources. He had begun a new relationship.
But after his father’s death — just a month before his trailer debuted at the Xbox briefing — and then the loss of a friend, Tan felt “paralyzed” and became hyperaware of his own mortality. He did not even know if he wanted to finish making the game.
As Tan weathered the emotional storm, he began thinking about the message he wanted to deliver. In 2020, he wrote the entire story of Way to the Woods while looking at a photo of his father.
Tan cannot remember exactly what his father was holding in that photo: an old cathode-ray monitor, a slab of beer, maybe something else entirely. There is a dreamlike quality to his recollection. But his father is smiling. The image inspired a sentimentality in Tan, an acknowledgment of his bond with his father and an appreciation for objects we often take for granted.
“These simple things are as fulfilling as the biggest thing you could possibly imagine,” Tan said.
Way to the Woods is littered with relics of the world that came before, one inhabited by humans. Tan elevates the status of lamps, flip phones and, yes, bulky computer monitors, by making them central to the journey. He hopes the player will feel the sense of wonder and awe that the deer do when encountering these unfamiliar objects.
Tan also had to reconcile with parts of himself that he did not like. The teenager whose screenshots of deer had drawn so much attention was “irony-pilled” and “internet-memey,” he said. He got introspective, expunging the kind of edgy humor you might find on the online message board 4chan but maintaining the playful, silly streak of his earlier games. Internet memes were out; a little more sincerity came in.
He was not interested in creating something ironic or melancholic. He was interested in joy.
“I tried so hard to make a meaningful, artistic, Journey-type experience,” Tan said. “And I’ve just ended up back at ‘I built some silly shit.’ And that, to me, also feels more true and more meaningful.”
Tan decided to lean into the giddy experience of traversing a world as an animal, one that could be seen as both majestic and ungainly.
The shift is acutely highlighted by the game’s soundtrack. Aivi & Surasshu, the music duo behind the soundtrack for the TV series “Steven Universe,” said its earliest draft for Way to the Woods had an oppressive tone. The pieces were more somber; the atmosphere pervading the game world more haunting. “Over time, both the game and the music started becoming more light,” Aivi said.
Some fans lost hope as Tan publicized release dates — 2019, 2020, 2023 (“pinky swear!”) — and then missed them, but he never lost the support of Microsoft. Chris Charla, the general manager of Xbox’s independent developer program, said the company was understanding when independent studios announced delays. “Developers put themselves under enough pressure, and we’re not interested in micromanaging ship dates,” he said.
For Tan, the development journey led him all the way back to the beginning. He was making a video game with the sensibilities of the projects he used to craft in his bedroom. Or Modern Bugfare 3, with its soft lighting, whimsical textures and absurd attitude.
That is not to say his biggest project is insincere. “It’s about care and it’s about wonder and those feelings and finding ways for that to be told through these deer,” Tan said. It is no longer trying to be something for someone else. Way to the Woods is all grown up.
Several months ago, Tan once again addressed the question hovering over him: When can people expect to play his deer game? He said he had recently crafted the ending and was working through a checklist of tasks. He was discussing release windows with publishers.
This time, he would not put a date on it.

Full text: Faced with the challenge of quickly recapping Olympic events, The Times creates its own animated versions of competitions. The internet loves them.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
It was the summer of 2016, and Derek Watkins, then a graphics editor at The New York Times, was staring down a challenge.
How could the newspaper provide coverage of Olympic events in record time for readers?
Mr. Watkins and other graphics editors decided upon what would eventually become a winning solution: a miniature version of the competitions, generated in a matter of minutes. Since the 2016 Games, members of the Digital News Design, Graphics, and Research and Development teams have created tiny, animated visualizations of Olympic events in swimming, running, skiing and figure skating.
"They looked like 2-D sprites," Eden Weingart, an art director on the Digital News Design team, said of the earliest versions of the simulations. In each Olympics since, she and her team have built upon that initial idea.
This year's track and field and swimming visuals have been a hit on TikTok and Instagram. Tiny swimming figures, now in 3-D, change strokes between laps in the medley events and race to video-game-like sound effects. On a track, animated runners break out of starting blocks and pump their arms, and viewers can see exactly when in the race they pull ahead or fall behind. Take Noah Lyles, who won the 100-meter dash on Sunday by five-thousandths of a second: It was hard to see on TV, but in the Times visual the Lyles avatar helped demonstrate to readers how he out-leaned the competition at the finish line.
In a recent interview, Ms. Weingart shared the most challenging parts of creating the visualizations and what she and her team are planning to do next. These are edited excerpts.
How long does it take to create a visual?
We all watch the race together on a video call or in the office. Immediately after a race, the Olympic Committee publishes data on all the athletes' times. Our team built an internal application that could customize and modify 3-D elements that react to the data.
When an event happens, we plug that data into the app, which generates animations. We make sure the animations match what we just saw happen, and that all the times and the results are accurate.
The whole process can take around 15 to 20 minutes. We try to be pretty quick.
What have been the biggest challenges?
A big challenge was creating a character that would be generic enough, but that wouldn't look weird. We definitely skirted the uncanny valley a few times.
Some races also have to be sped up 10x to fit into a minute. For instance, the 800-meter swimming freestyle lasts for about eight minutes. As much as people might enjoy these animations, they're not going to watch them for eight minutes. But we also don't want to speed it up so much that it doesn't look like swimming -- the swimmers' arms would look like propellers.
I'm so impressed with the level of detail. The swimmers even change strokes in the medley.
Each Olympics, we build on top of what we did last time. For the Tokyo Olympics, the little swimmers didn't have feet. They looked like little foosball people -- their arms moved through strokes, but they had no legs to kick.
When we did the figure skating events for the Beijing Olympics, we discovered that we could give the model legs, feet and more joints, and it didn't look weird. Then we thought, "We can definitely have them do a backstroke-to-breaststroke turn."
What has it been like to see the reader feedback?
It's really cool to see that readers and viewers are savvy and know that this is motion design and animation, and that there are people behind it. They're saying things like, "The designers deserve a gold medal." I've seen a couple of comments like, "This is A.I.," but most people seem to recognize that this is a craft-heavy thing. It's really encouraging for us.
The 'boop' sound when a swimmer touches the wall has been particularly beloved. Who gets credit?
We worked for the first time this year with a team from Audio -- led by Dan Powell -- that makes original sound for "The Daily" and other Times podcasts. We met with him and told him we wanted it to feel kind of like a video game. I mentioned the little sounds from Nintendo Switch and the footstep noises from Animal Crossing as references. At first we thought we might do splash sounds, but then we realized that keeping it more abstract worked better.
For the music inspiration, we shared the victory themes from Final Fantasy VII and Mario Kart, but then we said, "Put all of that in the world of the 'Challengers' soundtrack." The Audio team did an incredible job.
What's on your wish list for future Olympics coverage?
There are a few running events we don't currently cover, like relays and some of the longer runs. It would be really fun to animate the baton pass. As far as swimming, we've been able to get most of our wish list items done. But for the next Olympics, we've also been talking about creating different outfits based on the swimsuits they wear, or adding a world record line like the one you see on television.
If you could do these for one Olympic sport you haven't tackled yet, which would you choose?
Gymnastics would be amazing, but it's just so complicated. I'd love to see a little pommel horse or a little balance beam, though that would be a ton of animating!

After Fleeing Venezuela, Missing Those He Left Behind: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: A man fled the country to escape political violence and seek asylum in the United States. He has made some inroads in New York financially, but he misses the family he left behind.
Jackson Villamarin Villegas moved into a third-floor walk-up apartment in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn in March. An immigrant from Venezuela, he shares the small room -- and splits the $ 850 per month rent, plus utilities -- with another migrant from his country.
His landlord also lives in the apartment, sleeping behind a curtain in the living room.
The room is "big enough for what I have," said Mr. Villamarin, 42. Leonardo Uzcategui, founder and chief executive of Fundavenyc, a nonprofit group which provides assistance to Spanish-speaking New Yorkers, translated his words to English.
The space "feels good," but Mr. Villamarin would still like another place that's "bigger and more comfortable," he added.
Mr. Villamarin is among the more than 150,100 migrants who made their way to New York City between the spring of 2022 and the start of December 2023 -- a surge Mayor Eric Adams described as a humanitarian crisis and estimated could cost the city about $ 12 billion over three years.
He has applied for asylum now that he is in the United States. According to his asylum application, the Venezuelan government threatened his life, and because of his anti-government political activism, he was detained for 32 days in prison.
"From 2008 onward," Mr. Villamarin said, he received "letters that came to me at work with threats, letters at home that said, 'enough, stay away from the people you are joining because we will come for you and your family."'
While in jail in 2014, an object was placed in Mr. Villamarin's hand while he was tied to a chair, Mr. Villamarin recalled. There was an explosion, and he lost the tips of two of his fingers. He woke up in a military hospital, where the government released him from detention, he said.
Following a long and dangerous journey from Venezuela to the United States, Mr. Villamarin crossed the border into Texas in 2022. But finding his way in New York City was difficult. After catching a flight from San Antonio to La Guardia Airport using money that his cousin lent him, he needed to navigate the New York transit system to get from Queens to Manhattan. He got lost in the subway system for four hours before a police officer at a station in the Bronx guided him to a shelter processing center.
He was assigned a room at the Sleep Inn Hotel in Brooklyn with a roommate through the city, where he stayed for two years. The shelter, he said, allowed him to figure out how to find jobs without documentation -- landing one three months later for a junk removal and hauling company. Like many new arrivals in the United States, he worked off the books at first, but in May, he received his work authorization, said Mr. Uzcategui, the chief executive of Fundavenyc.
Mr. Villamarin has since applied for another job with New York City's Department of Social Services providing care for fellow migrants who are living in shelters, and is still waiting to hear back.
Jackson Villamarin Villegas, 42
Occupation: Laborer
On his family: Mr. Villamarin misses his family, whom he helps support financially, including his three teenage children who still live in Caracas. He often feels alone without them and only gets to talk to them on video on his phone. Still, "I don't have any regrets because it was my life and my family encouraged me to leave the country," he said. "And when your mom says something, you should listen regardless how old you are, and I left the country with the help of my family and for my life."
On his love for Super Mario: A Super Mario stuffed doll Mr. Villamarin bought from a street vendor in Guadalajara, Mexico, for 25 pesos rests on the built-in desk in his room. He loves Mario and has played the Nintendo video game since he was young. The doll was confiscated by border patrol officers for 24 hours when he was being processed at the border, before being returned to him. Now, Mr. Villamarin describes the Mario doll as his companion and best friend, and talks to it when he feels sad and alone.
Fundavenyc was among the organizations welcoming asylum seekers when Mr. Villamarin arrived in New York, Mr. Uzcategui said. In addition to helping Mr. Villamarin apply for asylum and a work authorization, the group helped him enroll in English classes, understand his rights, and connect with other immigrants who could mentor him through his journey, Mr. Uzcategui said. He also received a one-time stipend of nearly $ 600 from the group.
At the urging of Fundavenyc to become independent from the shelter system, Mr. Villamarin moved out of the shelter earlier in March, staying at a friend's house for a short time before moving into his Sheepshead Bay apartment, which he learned about through a WhatsApp group of fellow Venezuelans.
Mr. Villamarin's experience has been easier than that of many other recent migrants, Mr. Uzcategui said. He attributed that to Mr. Villamarin's positive attitude, that allowed him to overcome language and cultural barriers, and connect with people.
"That made his life easier than other cases that I've been able to witness myself, which have been horrible," Mr. Uzcategui said.
Mr. Villamarin hasn't made many friends since moving to New York, which often makes him feel isolated. When he's not working, he tends to keep to himself so he can rest, recover and, as a Catholic, pray.
The new apartment has also allowed Mr. Villamarin to reconnect with his passion for cooking.
In Caracas, he owned a food cart with his sister called "Honor a mi Familia," that sold hot dogs, fried rice, soups and cachapas, a popular Venezuelan dish similar to pancakes, which he cooked on a gas stove. He wasn't allowed to cook at the New York hotel, so he had to eat out every day.
The new apartment has a narrow but full kitchen, with an oven, stovetop and a lot of appliances. He has made a number of Venezuelan, Mexican and Argentine dishes. Now in the United States, he would like one day to cook professionally again.
"My profession is the kitchen. I love cooking," said Mr. Villamarin. "I feel extremely happy cooking, my food is healthier, I feel very very well."
Two rows of flat-brimmed hats sit on top of a small built-in desk next to the TV in Mr. Villamarin's room in Brooklyn. He loves to collect hats and tries to buy a new one each week. The collection has now grown to 29 -- most of them representing various American sports teams and players, such as the New York Knicks, the New York Yankees, the Philadelphia Phillies, the Chicago Bulls, and Kobe Bryant.
The hobby dates back to his childhood when he watched Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association games with his father on TV. He wanted to come to the United States to see a game in one of those arenas or stadiums -- a trip that was unattainable for his family. So both he and his father settled by buying team caps instead.
Now in New York, he was finally able to attend a Mets game at Citi Field in April. He paid about $ 45 for his seat on the third-level balcony behind home plate. He said he cried with joy as he walked around the stadium and saw its "beautiful facilities."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This week in Newly Reviewed, Walker Mimms covers the overlooked artist Ker-Xavier Roussel, Fritz Scholder's paintings and a group show in a modest office-like space.
Ker-Xavier Roussel
Through Aug. 23. Michael Werner Gallery, 4 East 77th Street, Manhattan; 212-988-1623; michaelwerner.com.
The debate around whether modernity has killed imagination is up to you, but the question is posed with urgency and sugary elegance in the 44 paintings and drawings on view at Michael Werner by Ker-Xavier Roussel (1867-1944), an overlooked French painter of the Nabis school.
The Nabis named themselves after the Hebrew "navis," for "prophets," and Roussel's broad array of neon forms here, like Édouard Vuillard's, presage abstraction and the allegories of Bob Thompson. The shocker is that as the 20th-century quote-unquote modernized, Roussel persisted in painting Greek mythological scenes, a brand of escapism that peaked back in the 18th century, with a spontaneity that made these tales new.
On a slice of cardboard circa 1910, Roussel painted Acis and Galatea in a loving embrace, in a propulsive low-perspective "X" composition that feels both erotic but also doomed once you discover Galatea's spurned admirer, the killer Cyclops Polyphemus, advancing from the valley above.
Roussel didn't seem to date his works, so the conjectures here are tempting. "L'Enlèvement d'Europe" is a slip of paper the size of a candy bar. Drawn around 1914, as the world powers braced for war, it depicts the abduction of Europa, the mythological mother of that continent, in wisps of pink, blue and canary pastel that belie the central action, a rape by Zeus. In a painting circa 1943, as France weathered Nazi occupation, Roussel separated -- or drew together -- a nymph from a predatory faun with a diagonal shock of sunlight.
Is it escapism or menace? Roussel's commitment to antique brutalities in times of technologized warfare raises questions about distance and engagement that feel as relevant in our age of signifying social art as they did when Tiepolo painted his allegories of conquest in the 1720s, huge canvases that today preface the Met's European wing. Roussel, in his stubborn and invigorating neoclassicism, found a realm where our baser realities and a basic beauty coincided.
Fritz Scholder
Through Aug. 9. Garth Greenan Gallery, 545 West 20th Street, Manhattan; 212-929-1351; garthgreenan.com.
Though his ancestry was of the Indigenous Luiseño, the Minnesota-born Fritz Scholder (1937-2005) brought a disturbing ambiguity to his paintings of Native American life. Fifteen are on view in "Paintings 1968-1980" at Garth Greenan. Some are hard to look at, but they are among the most compelling Pop stylings I can name.
A student of Wayne Thiebaud, the painter of cakes and ice creams, Scholder channeled his teacher's appetite for color in a reclining figure from 1972, whom he has clothed in Western wear and haloed in Christmassy red and green against a field of rose.
Except the man is called "Drunk Indian." The irony of Scholder's colors is that they heighten scenes of moral defeat. He borrows the horror-core of Francis Bacon for two canvases from 1970 that imagine the Wounded Knee massacre, where in 1890 American troops killed about 300 Lakota people. Scholder scrunches corpses to the top of each canvas, ingloriously. From one body, clothed in tropical green and pink, a fountain of red rains down. Another is rendered in the colors of meat and bone.
It gets worse, though the gallery does Scholder the favor of sampling his breadth beyond mere depravity. The works here range from sarcasm -- in "Indian on Red Horse" (1969), a Ralph Steadman-like cowboy raises an American flag with a blank, almost deathly scowl -- to Pop appropriation. Even nobility.
In a 1975 adaptation of a hunting scene by George Catlin, an early American painter of Native life, Scholder pours a line of Barbie-pink acrylic through the buffalo and the archer who chases him, unifying the two in an elegant swoop of motion.
With his unflinching and monumental types, Scholder seems to have sought -- as Jasper Johns did with the American flag -- a portrait of the modern mind contemplating these Native origin stories, as much as he depicts those stories themselves.
'A String of Tongueless Bells'
Through Aug. 17. Francis Irv, 106 Walker Street, Suite 201, Manhattan; 719-221-0528; francisirv.com.
In a season of kitchen-sink group shows, a Zenlike octet of broken tools distinguishes itself at Francis Irv, a cubbyhole of a gallery so small and sparsely hung that I first read it as an office.
Two enamel on linen paintings by Paul Sietsema achieve some of the highest trompe I have ever l'oeiled. Sietsema depicts objects that have been drenched in a viscous liquid -- a rotary phone in black, a shattered LP in white -- with such photographic fineness that I couldn't always distinguish their wet-looking subjects from the actual painted surface.
The only obvious artwork -- a bronze of a sleeping baby by the sculptor Osama Al Rayyan -- has been set on a pedestal, as if to deem this room aesthetic: Go forth and judge. Nearby, Benjamin Echeverria's white canvas carries big black dots in the formation of a gambler's die, except two dots have disappeared, leaving shadows, so that Al Rayyan's baby appears to have plopped out of that dimension and birthed itself.
The plainness of presentation recalls Dada's situational origins. In the corner where I would have installed a desk, there is an antique dining table by the assemblage artist Phung-Tien Phan, a circular saw blade lodged into its top. On a wall, the American artist Win McCarthy joins drywall T-squares at angles that are precise but of indiscernible logic, no matter how closely scrutinized. McCarthy has dipped one end in safety orange, the way construction workers paint the tops of metal fence stakes so they don't impale pedestrians.
Needless items that speak exactly -- at times exclusively -- where they've been placed. In other words, art. A century after Man Ray rigged his evil iron with thumbtacks, we might still need the anti-object. But according to this clever gallery, which has made the most of a tiny space when rents have never been higher and more prohibitive, context is everything.
Last Chance
Virginia Overton
Through Aug. 9. Bortolami, 39 Walker Street, Manhattan. 212-727-2050; bortolamigallery.com.
You don't have to know how Virginia Overton made "Untitled (nude descending a staircase)" to enjoy it. Comprising dozens of 1-foot-by-8-foot sheets of glittering, silvery steel, each bent or bowed in a different place and lined up edge to edge across Bortolami gallery's back wall, it has the same jagged, thrilling sense of possibility and movement as the 1912 Marcel Duchamp painting name-checked in the title.
A second piece, "Untitled (horizon)," runs a four-and-a-half-foot stripe of more weathered looking panels of aluminum and steel around three walls of a small room. Two other works -- "Untitled (cascade)" and "Untitled (gather)" -- hold floral sprays of galvanized steel in vises, creating beautiful dissonances of delicacy and force.
It does, however, add something to know that Overton specializes in reclaiming materials and responding to specific architectural sites, and that all the metal in this show came from the mammoth old Domino Sugar sign on the Brooklyn waterfront. Domino and the real estate developer Two Trees commissioned Overton to turn it into art.
The commission proper, an enormous yellow wall piece, hangs in an office building at the Domino development, while this show comes from the leftovers, and the much more intimate dissonance between art and real estate, or art and advertising, adds a certain electric crackle. More than that, though, thinking of the original Domino sign illuminates the strange familiarity of "Untitled (nude descending a staircase)," the deeply satisfying quality of its irregular ups and downs -- it still kind of looks like writing.

Enter Andrew Wyeth
Through Aug. 9. Schoelkopf Gallery, 390 Broadway, Manhattan; 212-879-8815; schoelkopfgallery.com.
Before becoming America's revivalist in the matte tones of egg tempera, Andrew Wyeth debuted at the Macbeth Gallery in 1937, age 20, with watercolor landscapes. Watercolor is cheap and portable, but in pigments that thin each stroke means commitment. Less is more, instinct reigns. Wyeth knew it, and the four early watercolors that kick off Schoelkopf's mini retrospective -- 20 works on paper and canvas -- reveal an economy of brush strokes verging on chaos.
His riverbank "Maplejuice Cove" (1942) is a wash of umber diluted almost to off-white. Two swaths of black suggest a near and a far shore, but a few confetti-like details in dry-brush are what turn the empty space into depth. Machine-gun blasts of blue make river stones in a shallow end. Three stiff, grassy strokes convert a patch of blank space into a puddle. Up top, stabs of green and brown become birds in flight once he's dragged their reflections down into the surface of the river with a speed of hand that seems to match theirs.
Beside fireworks like those, even the mature Wyeth of austere realism looks like a daredevil. In 1972, when he hits a crease in the page during a pencil portrait -- one of four in this show -- he scrapes his pencil along it to pronounce a wayward strand of the sitter's hair, the way you'd take a rubbing from a coin. "Left Hook" (1984) is a bleak winter landscape, but blank patches in the dead log at center capture the glare from a sun he has kept out of frame. In the field just beyond the log, Wyeth scrapes a pen nib or other such sharp thing to rake up fresh white pulp from his paper: light glinting off grass.
You're as old as you feel, and in the deep range of this small show Wyeth's decades of dry precision owe much to his youthful baptism by water. WALKER MIMMS
Elmer Guevara
Through Aug. 3. Lyles & King, 19 Henry Street, Manhattan; 646-484-5478, lylesandking.com.
A man in an umbrella hat reaches down to a boy by a basketball court. Both wear "Bryant" jerseys. The neighborhood seems peaceful on a sunny day but at their feet are names and a chalk outline of a human body.
This scene, from Elmer Guevara's "Hoova' Park Stroll," embodies the sentiments of "Recess," his first solo exhibition in New York.
In the 1980s, Guevara's parents escaped to the United States from the brutal civil warin El Salvador. Full of visual cues from his early years in South Central Los Angeles, where he was born and still lives, the show is the artist's reckoning with his childhood. In fact, the two figures in "Hoova' Park Stroll" are his self-portraits at different ages.
Using extracts from family photographs, news clippings and film stills, Guevara makes visible the native culture of the immigrant melding into a new way of life. Perhaps this notion of settlement is most palpable in the children with their homemade Halloween costumes and fascinating array of sneakers: Theirs will be a future vastly different from their parents' past.
Although the paintings are vibrant, the show's strength is in its subtleties. Beneath the veneer of peaceful and slow living lies the trauma and violence interwoven with the artist's upbringing: Stashes of cash recall his parent's distrust of banks. In "Waiting for Nightfall," children in Halloween costumes await the chance to trick or treat, surrounded by a black cat, a menacing coyote and the chalk outline of a dead body. The statement "Recess" makes is clear: Immigrants' situations are always precarious, even as they find new and solid ground. YINKA ELUJOBA

Kyle Dunn
Through Sept. 1. Wadsworth Atheneum, 600 Main Street, Hartford; 860-278-2670, thewadsworth.org.
Decaying fruit is a venerable subject for artists, but in Kyle Dunn's up-to-date version, pears bear supermarket stickers alongside brown spots. Equally of-the-moment: Many of the recent paintings in Dunn's first museum show cast a tender gaze on an idealized boyfriend in tableaus of queer domesticity.
A young New York-based painter who shows at PPOW, where six of 11 works in this exhibition were on view last year, Dunn harks back to a previous generation of gay artists, including Paul Cadmus, Jared French and George Tooker, who themselves looked to the Italian Renaissance to find inspiration for their glorified renderings of the male body.
Dunn's field of reference is broad, ranging from "The Legend of Zelda" video games to Pieter Bruegel the Elder (whose "Hunters in the Snow" is quoted here in the 2022 painting "The Hunt"). He takes infectious, virtuosic pleasure in capturing the way light refracts in a cocktail glass or glows from an iPhone.
This hyper-realistic style lends itself to Surrealism. In "Sea Bell" (2024), a framed painting of a heron devouring a small fish, which hangs on a wall, resonates with a frog chasing a moth over the torso of a naked, sleeping young man. The view is through a door frame (over which a giant moth is resting) and behind it, a window frames the red orb of a sun in a sky that appears awfully dark for sunset. An empty frame outside the doorway supports a chained bell. Frame upon frame upon frame. Life is but a dream. ARTHUR LUBOW
John Ahearn and Rigoberto Torres
Through Aug. 16. Salon 94, 3 East 89th Street, Manhattan; 212-979-0001; salon94.com.
In 1979, the artists John Ahearn and Rigoberto Torres created 21 busts at Fashion Moda, a high-energy alternative art space that ran in the Bronx from 1978 to 1993. Known as "The South Bronx Hall of Fame," this group of portraits are now, together with other sculptures, the subject of a new exhibition, "Walton Ave & Friends," at Salon 94.
By the time Ahearn and Torres met at Fashion Moda, it had become host to off-the-curve collaborations between the graffiti and hip-hop worlds. (Ahearn was born in Binghamton, N.Y., and settled in the Bronx; Torres was born in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, and grew up in the Bronx.)
They were not conventionally trained artists. Torres learned mold-making and casting at his uncle's factory, which manufactured religious figures, and Ahearn first discovered casting from a book on makeup for television and film. But they followed Fashion Moda's practice of engaging the local community, employing residents as sitters. Right on the sidewalk, they would cover a willing model in plaster, and afterward the volunteer would receive a painted copy of their sculpted portrait. It was a radical approach to art, proving that great work could be made outside the solitary air of a studio.
At Salon 94, the sculptures, mostly leaning against or fixed to the walls of the gallery, carry the infectious joy of any ordinary day in a regular neighborhood. "Maggie and Connie" features a woman returning from grocery shopping, her daughter holding on to her arm. In "Ralph and Kido," a man plays with a young boy; and a woman styles a girl's hair in "Carmen Combing Erica's Hair." The busts, set in an upscale ballroom with limestone walls, are hung far above the heads of onlookers, in the same way they were displayed at Fashion Moda in 1979.
Ahearn and Torres produced these sculptures in an age when the South Bronx was devastated by crime and poverty. But the happiness in "Walton Ave & Friends" is how that age will be remembered, proving that a people's triumphant legacy can be made possible through communal participation in art making.

'Painting Deconstructed'
Through Aug. 18. Ortega y Gasset Projects, 363 Third Avenue, Brooklyn; oygprojects.com.
What makes a painting a painting? Is it the application of color to canvas or board? The fact that it hangs on a wall? What about different types of art that are informed by painting's histories and conventions? Where should we draw the line (pun intended)?
These are some of the questions raised by "Painting Deconstructed," an exhibition featuring 46 contemporary artists who work in a wide range of mediums and materials. That's what makes the show equally smart and fun: You won't find a straightforward painting anywhere. Instead you'll find pieces made of ceramics, fabric, photography, and even balloons that evoke paintings, and paint applied to all manner of surfaces, including T-shirts and palm husk.
For me, looking back and forth between the artworks and checklist became a kind of treasure hunt. I wanted to find out what elements made up Scott Vander Veen's wonderfully tactile "Graft #2 (Thigmomorphogenesis)" (2023). Learning that Jodi Hays used a found plein-air painting kit in her weathered "Self Portrait at 61" (2024) made me chuckle.
Kevin Umaña's "Split Apple Core" (2023) is a technical marvel: a complex and sumptuous ceramic work that could be an abstract painting. I delighted in the conceptual cleverness of Erika Ranee's multimedia and nonrepresentational "Selfie" (2024), which includes black-eyed peas, a plant and the artist's hair dipped in acrylic.
There's remarkable skill on view throughout "Painting Deconstructed," but it doesn't feel like it's being deployed solely for technical ends. These artists experiment in order to open up the category of painting. They use what it has been to imagine what it might yet be. JILLIAN STEINHAUER
Robert Irwin
Through Aug 31. Judd Foundation, 101 Spring Street, Manhattan; 212-219-2747, juddfoundation.org. Public hours: Friday-Saturday, 1-5 p.m., or by appointment.
In 1971 Robert Irwin installed a 12-foot acrylic column in the ground floor of Donald Judd's SoHo studio, a prism positioned to pick up light from the building's large southern and western windows. Since the early '60s, Irwin had been pushing the definition of art beyond objecthood, gradually reducing his work of distractions until he stopped producing salable art works. By 1970, he had abandoned his studio in favor of what he called a conditional practice: making subtle, barely perceptible interventions in architecture to tease out the marvels of visual potential. He viewed his installations merely as tools to induce the real art, which was perception -- "to make people conscious of their consciousness."
A later iteration of that work, "Sculpture/Configuration 2T/3L," first exhibited at Pace in 2018, is on view in roughly the same spot (the hole bored through the floor 53 years ago remains, never filled). More advanced, formed by two columns of stuttering panels of teal and smoky brown acrylic, it's beautiful, but its beauty is beside the point. It melts into the background, both there and not there. Sunlight catches a corner or flutters over a faceted edge as you move around it, splicing and refracting SoHo's thrum, making it new.
The installation's long run means the quality of natural light will change and so too will the effect. It's a slow, affecting distillation of Irwin's philosophy, which remains generously contra the art world's relentless demand for novelty. Irwin, who died last year, refined an expansive vision, making us aware of the transitory, letting us see what was always there, for as long as we can. MAX LAKIN
Huong Dodinh
Through Aug. 16. Pace Gallery, 540 West 25th Street, Manhattan; 212-421-3292; pacegallery.com.
Buoyed by a great sense of calm, and even silence, the paintings in Huong Dodinh's "Transcendence" represent an artist's triumph after decades of pursuing concision by adopting a minimalist vocabulary. It is this Paris-based artist's first-ever solo exhibition in the United States in her close to 60 years of painting.
Beginning with a rare 1966 figurative painting, whose colors seem to recall Pieter Bruegel the Elder's "Hunters in the Snow," the show progresses to the '90s and to the last couple of years. Figuration falls away as the decades pass, the artist's hand becomes less pronounced, and by the 2000s Dodinh's central concerns emerge: light, density, transparency and how these interact with lines, forms and space. These come together gracefully in works like "Sans Titre," from 1990, in which three sensual curves depict what could be mountains in a desert, or layers of women's breasts.
Dodinh's soft palette -- a quiet but delightsome range of carton browns, light blues, and off-whites -- originated from her first experience with snow in Paris, where her family fled from Vietnam in 1953 during the First Indochina War. She was a child in boarding school when she first witnessed snow and marveled at how it revealed subtle colors underneath when it started to melt. Subtlety, a hallmark of Dodinh's work, is something she goes to great lengths to attain: She has always worked alone, without assistants, makes her own pigments, ensuring that every inch of her canvas is filled with an energy that is wholly hers. It has been a long solitary journey and after all these years, even while Dodinh masters the art of austerity, her work feels adorned. YINKA ELUJOBA
'Byzantine Bembé: New York by Manny Vega'
Through Dec. 8. Museum of the City of New York, 1220 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan; 212-534-1672, mcny.org.
In celebration of its centennial year, the Museum of the City of New York invited Manny Vega to be its first artist in residence. Fabulous choice. Vega is a native New Yorker and a treasure, with a nearly four-decade track record of visual scintillation behind him. The essence of that career is distilled in a 24-karat nugget of a survey, "Byzantine Bembé: New York by Manny Vega," assembled by Monxo López, the museum's curator of community histories.
Puerto Rican by descent, Vega was born in 1956 in the Bronx, raised there and in Manhattan, and an immersion in art came early. One of his first jobs after graduating from the High School of Art and Design was as a guard at the Cloisters, the Met's branch in Upper Manhattan devoted to European medieval art. In 1979 he joined El Taller Boricua (Puerto Rican Workshop), the street-active artist collective and graphics workshop in the East Harlem neighborhood known as El Barrio.
In the early 1980s, he began traveling to Brazil, where he was initiated into Candomblé, an Afro-Atlantic religion that fuses West African Yoruba and Roman Catholic beliefs and has a vivid tradition of ceremonial art, including beaded banners and ritual utensils, both of which Vega has produced. Given these entwined influences, conventional distinctions between "high art," "popular art" and "spiritual art" have never made sense to him, which explains the title of his show, "Byzantine" suggesting intricate formal polish; and "Bembé" evoking drum-driven religious worship that is also a party.
The mix is there in four small paintings he made in 1997 as studies for a set of mosaics commissioned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for the subway station at East 110th Street and Lexington Avenue. Brightly colored and packed with figures, the images depict El Barrio street life -- neighbors jostling, vendors selling, bands playing -- and give it a charge of devotional fervor, aural exultation. (A tour of other Vega commissions in East Harlem, all within walking distance of the museum, is well worth making, a highlight being his tender homage to the poet Julia de Burgos (1914-1953) on a building at East 106th Street and Lexington Avenue.)
Sound and movement are major components in Vega's visual universe. Icon-like images of Ochun, the Yoruba goddess of dance, and St. Cecilia, the Roman Catholic patron saint of music, appear in the show as tutelary spirits. And there are others. One is the Barrio-born jazz musician Tito Puente, whose album covers Vega has reproduced as glass mosaics. And in a large ink drawing, as crisp as a woodcut, we find the assembled performers of Los Pleneros de la 21, a local dance and music troupe promoting traditional bomba and plena.
Politics runs, like a bass note, throughout Vega's art. In his case, though, it's far less a politics of overt protest than of positive assertion.
In the work of this profoundly devotional artist, the presiding deity is Changó, the Afro-Atlantic spirit of justice and balance, and also of dancing and drumming. A watercolor painting of him closes the show, and it's a classic Vega creation: formally precise, imaginatively stimulating, instantly accessible. And it has found just the right home. It's on loan to the show from Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor who, a wall text tells us, displays it in her chambers in Washington. HOLLAND COTTER

Truong Cong Tung
Through July 27. Canal Projects, 351 Canal Street; canalprojects.org.
The first image that springs to mind at Truong Cong Tung's small but mighty exhibition, "Trail Dust," is the human circulatory system. Thin plastic tubes form a web of coils on the gallery floor, evoking veins and capillaries. Though their circuit carries water, not blood, the tubes connect and nourish three small islands of soil-filled platforms filled with sand, gourds and plants.
This installation, titled "The state of absence -- Voices from outside" (2020-ongoing), is Tung's chef d'oeuvre. The work -- a homage to the artist's native Vietnam, its land and its environmental evolution during and after French colonialism and the war with the United States. It entrances the senses with the quiet buzz of life in organic motion: the rush of the silt-brown water, the pungent scent of decomposing plants, the slow scuttle of little insects crawling in the sand. But it is plastic that binds all this, alluding to imbrications between the natural and the manufactured in colonial and post-colonial Vietnam.
Most remarkable in "The state of absence" installation are the dozens of lacquer-coated dried gourds, sourced from Vietnam's Central Highlands, where Tung grew up and where elders often use gourds for storage, drinking, and music-making. Here, they are laid in the sand, plump with a mixture of seeds from Vietnam and the United States.
Tung flexes his finely tuned painterly muscles in four lacquer paintings, all titled "Shadows in the garden #3," lustrous scenes of flora and fauna rendered in brown, red and gold.
A video projected on the gallery's back wall, "The Lost Landscape #1 (2021)," continues to haunt me. Shot at the National Museum of Natural History in France -- whose collection includes plants and animals from Vietnam -- the video threads together eerie close-ups of the glass eyes of taxidermy animals. Each lifeless gaze suggests the violent subordination and extraction of natural life that attended modern colonialism. "Trail Dust" itself flickers with Tung's metaphorical gaze, an honest and solicitous regard for the reality of a land, bruised beauty and all. ZOË HOPKINS

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The fans flooded through the streets of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by the thousands, kept cool by mist machines in the 110-degree heat. A 30-foot-tall replica gold trophy towered over onlookers at the city's center. For a moment, covered in beams of brightly colored light, a country defined by tradition looked futuristic.
It was the inaugural Esports World Cup, a coming-out party for Saudi Arabia's growing video game industry. As part of its plan to diversify its economy from oil, the Saudi government has said it will invest $ 38 billion in video games by 2030 through its Public Investment Fund, known as the P.I.F., a wealth fund that manages $ 700 billion.
The wealth behind that commitment was on full display in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, this month, but the country's influence in video games now extends far beyond its borders. In what has been a financially difficult year for the industry, which has seen mass layoffs, many of the world's largest video game companies and influencers have quietly partnered with the oil-rich Saudis.
Through acquisitions, a company funded by the P.I.F. called Savvy Games Group now owns 40 percent of the total e-sports market share, a spokesperson said. (E-sports are video games played by professional gamers in competitive tournaments.) The P.I.F. and its subsidiaries have spent roughly $ 6 billion buying up game companies and $ 14 billion on stock investments.
"They've used unlimited resources to pretty much make whatever they want to happen, happen," said Rod Breslau, a gaming and e-sports analyst.
Some critics have labeled the investments "games washing," an attempt to polish the country's reputation and human rights abuses with entertainment and tourism, as it has been accused of doing with its professional golf and soccer leagues. Some gamers have denounced the country's involvement and vowed to boycott its events. And it can be jarring for visitors to see women -- some of them in elaborate costumes -- working at a conference in a country where women's rights have historically been, and continue to be, very restricted.
But as Saudi money becomes ubiquitous in the e-sports world, avoiding it has become increasingly difficult.
"We've gotten to the point where if you draw the line and say, 'I'm not working for a Saudi-owned company,' or 'I'm not going to Saudi Arabia,' your career in e-sports would probably be very short lived," said Parker Mackay, an e-sports broadcaster who resigned from his position on an awards panel in June after it partnered with a Saudi-funded organization.
Along with buying up game publishers and hosting extravagant e-sports tournaments, the Saudi kingdom is building a gaming city with its own e-sports district 30 miles west of Riyadh called Qiddiya. Its companies have partnered with video game giants like Sony and Activision Blizzard, which is owned by Microsoft, and media companies like Rolling Stone and CNN.
Leaders of Saudi gaming organizations have pushed back on criticism of the kingdom's financial interest in gaming.
"Three years ago, I would have had my own prejudices as well, thinking about what Saudi is and what it is not," said Ralf Reichert, the chief executive officer of the Esports World Cup Foundation. "Ultimately, everyone needs to judge it on their own, and I just invite people to come and see it."
Once a country that effectively banned movie theaters and strictly restricted tourism, Saudi Arabia has poured wealth into sports and entertainment at a staggering rate. Notably, the 38-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is an avid gamer.
The P.I.F. is heavily invested in publicly traded video game companies. Its stock portfolio includes a $ 3.4 billion investment in Electronic Arts, $ 1.7 billion in Take-Two Interactive and $ 5.2 billion in Nintendo, according to data from Nasdaq. Its 8.3 percent stake in Nintendo makes it the Japanese company's largest outside investor, according to Japanese regulatory filings. The fund also had a $ 3.3 billion investment in Activision Blizzard before it was acquired by Microsoft.
In 2021, the P.I.F. created Savvy Games Group to spearhead its planned $ 38 billion investment in the industry. The fund recruited Brian Ward, a former director at Electronic Arts and vice president at Activision Blizzard, to be the company's chief executive officer.
As part of the government's plan to create 250 video game companies and 39,000 new jobs on Saudi soil, Savvy Games Group and other P.I.F.-funded companies have recruited top game developer talent from the United States and Asia. In June, Saudi Arabia's U.S. embassy launched an exchange program to connect young Saudi game developers with Americans.
Savvy Games Group has already acquired a number of key industry players, most notably Electronic Sports League, which is to e-sports what the PGA Tour is to golf, and Scopely, the game studio behind Monopoly Go. The company also acquired Faceit, a digital e-sports platform, combining it with its other e-sports properties into Electronic Sports League Faceit Group, or E.F.G.
In January, Activision Blizzard partnered with E.F.G. to revive the e-sports circuit for its popular game Overwatch, which had shuttered a few months earlier.
In May, E.F.G. provided funding for Rolling Stone to create a new gaming desk.
Rolling Stone did not respond to a request for comment.
Back in Riyadh at the Esports World Cup, gamers competed for a share of a $ 60 million prize pool, the largest ever for an event of its kind.
The tournament is meant to be "a lighthouse in the world sports calendar," Mr. Reichert said.
The eight-week event was organized by the Esports World Cup Foundation, a Saudi nonprofit.
The foundation has leaned on big-name partnerships to spread its influence. In March, Sony became a founding partner of the tournament and is set to produce an Esports World Cup documentary. In June, Warner Bros. Discovery partnered with the foundation to stream the event on CNN. Hours before the tournament's opening ceremony, two dozen of the most followed gaming influencers posted links to its livestream on X with the hashtag #EWCPartner.
Some e-sports teams are trying to make a social statement while still accepting Saudi cash. Team Liquid, an e-sports team known for promoting diversity and inclusion in the sport, wore jerseys with a Pride logo during competition. Its leaders had mulled over what it meant to play in Riyadh in the weeks leading up to the tournament.
"Participating in a region of the world with a pretty egregious track record of human rights is difficult," said Steve Arhancet, the team's co-chief executive officer. Mr. Arhancet, who is gay, said he took a trip to Riyadh on his own before deciding whether to compete in the tournament.
Some influencers tried to justify their participation to their fans on social media.
Joshua Howard, a sportscaster for the tournament, said his 10 day contract with the Esports World Cup will account for 20 to 30 percent of his annual earnings.
"When you see an opportunity come along that way, it's really hard to say no, and I don't begrudge anyone for saying no or being upset that I'm here," Mr. Howard said.

Five Women and Their Secret Society: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It was their own secret society. Five women who worked together at the Public Theater, bonding over drinks and aspirations, sharing frustrations and ideas, commiserating and brainstorming and laughing.
They gave their alliance a nickname: Women and Ambition -- cheeky because, as they saw it, "ambitious" remained such a loaded adjective for young women. Their convergence at the Public in the mid-2010s would resonate as far more than happy memories: Now each of them has become a Woman With Power, in a beleaguered field in vital need of new inspiration.
"These women have helped change the trajectory of my life," said one of the women, Maria Goyanes, who is now the artistic director of Woolly Mammoth Theater in Washington.
Lear deBessonet, who oversees the long-running Encores! series at New York City Center, recalled the prevailing spirit: "There was a sense of like, 'I see you, girl. I see you. You've got to run things now."'
And now they do.
Before deBessonet officially took over the Encores! series in 2021, she ran Public Works, the community-oriented program that stages a musical adaptation of a classic story each summer. Once at Encores!, which gives rarely revived shows short-running productions, she got off to a shaky start during the pandemic. But she's since had a number of buzzy productions, including a starry "Into the Woods," which went to Broadway. This summer, her acclaimed production of "Once Upon a Mattress," with Sutton Foster, is Broadway-bound as well.
Shanta Thake, who oversaw Joe's Pub for many years at the Public, has been since 2021 chief artistic officer for Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Stephanie Ybarra, who ran the Public's Mobile Unit, left to become the artistic director of Baltimore Center Stage and is now a program officer for arts and culture at the Mellon Foundation.
And Meiyin Wang, who coordinated the Under the Radar festival at the Public, is now the director of producing and programming at the new $ 500 million Perelman Performing Arts Center in Lower Manhattan.
That all five women -- four of them women of color, all now in their 40s -- have ascended to influential leadership roles reflects not only their talents, but also the evolving portrait of power in the arts. A National Endowment for the Arts study, for example, found that by 2019 women accounted for 49 percent of the managerial roles in performing arts companies.
The story of these five friends illuminates a truth that transcends statistics: Women are achieving parity in the upper ranks of a profession that, like so many others, has historically favored the advancement of men. Still, it's hard to imagine in the 21st century the need for a group called "Men and Ambition."
Not that female aspiration in the theater is anything of a novelty: Foundational leaders of the regional theater movement, back when it started in the 1950s, included women like Zelda Fichandler at Arena Stage and Margo Jones at Theater 47.
So in gathering these five leaders recently, I wanted to understand what instinctual values they shared, and how synergy bound them. (They're all still good friends and lean on one another, though maybe not as intensely as in the days when they retired to BBar on the Bowery, now closed.) I also wanted to hear their thoughts on a culture that still exhibits double standards when it comes to women in authority.
"The idea was about how ambition felt like such a dirty word," Goyanes said, explaining the group's rationale. "How it was so, you know, how we were driven, and how that was seen as not how we're supposed to act."
"We used to argue about things," Thake said. "We used to sit in the office and argue about what assumptions lived inside of the word 'leader.' Inside of the words 'artistic director,' inside of what does it mean to lead an institution? We would wrestle with the dominant belief system or how we were being raised but, like, what was being modeled for us?"
"I think it was feeling clear," deBessonet added, "that if being a leader meant being a person we didn't want to be like, we weren't willing to be that type."
What that meant was discussing their own insecurities about occupying roles in an industry perennially rife with insecurity. Goyanes described an ongoing battle of conscience: being a manager with a solid job in a field of struggling artists.
"I grew up in an immigrant family," she said. "Should I be of more direct service to people? Is storytelling enough or is this actually being selfish?"
The struggle early on was not just a matter of refining their managerial visions, but building a kind of collective self-confidence, learning that the advancement of any one of them was a success for all of them. For women of their generation, that mutual support felt almost revolutionary.
I'd arranged first to interview them separately, and now we were all together at Lafayette, a restaurant across the street from the Public, in the heart of Greenwich Village. Thake had come to the Public as an intern in 2003, and Goyanes arrived the following year, becoming a producing associate for Oskar Eustis when he was named artistic director in 2005.
It was Goyanes who over the next several years brought Ybarra, Wang and deBessonet into the Public's fold. As Ybarra recalled, Goyanes -- "a professional acquaintance" -- phoned her one day in 2011, saying, "'We have a job that's opening up in the artistic department; I'm positive that you're overqualified for it. Will you come and talk to us anyway?"'
With a Yale Drama School degree and experience as a producing director at the Playwrights Realm, an Off Broadway incubator for emerging dramatists, Ybarra went for it.
"This is where I think my ambition and strategy come into play," she said. "I took a pay cut to go to the Public. I took a title cut to go to the Public. But I was betting on myself in a way that was sort of like, 'They don't know who they have yet."' Her steerage of the Mobile Unit -- including a tour of Lynn Nottage's "Sweat" to hard-pressed industrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest -- led to her appointment in 2018 as artistic director of Baltimore Center Stage.
Eustis, their former boss, said in a telephone interview that the Public's particular scope -- the Off Broadway institution that birthed "A Chorus Line" and "Hamilton," but also free Shakespeare in Central Park -- was in a sense built for these women. "We are not a niche theater," he said. "It's known for people who can run with the ball, and each of those women, who ran those programs, had a great deal of autonomy.
"All these women are passionate about the world, about equality, democracy, access, as well as passionate about art," Eustis added. "And the Public Theater called to them."
Some of what forged their bonds were indeed the idealistic aspirations of the Public, a sometimes unwieldy, sometimes financially challenged organization with a staff of around 200 and a mission of being the people's theater.
Still, what the company instilled in the women has never lost its value. "I think we all had the same goal," suggested Thake, who has endeavored at Lincoln Center to open the campus to a wider range of artists. As the center's leaders shake up long-running programs like Mostly Mozart, Thake and her staff are introducing city audiences to hipper summer diversions like the NYC Ska Orchestra, "The Dream Machine Experience" and the singer Dobet Gnahoré.
"We're very different people, like so different, actually," Thake said of the women. "However, I think we all really share this one idea: that art matters."
All came from varied -- and not seamlessly paved -- paths to the arts, deBessonet noted. Goyanes grew up in Queens, the daughter of a city transit worker. Wang is from Singapore, arriving in the United States for college. Thake comes from a middle-class family in Santa Claus, Ind. ("I grew up on Ornament Lane," she said, laughing.) Ybarra was raised in San Antonio with a Latino father and a Czech mother. And as a child in Baton Rouge, La., deBessonet "did shows in my backyard with my sister and my dog."
From those disparate roots, these women came of age with a similar sense of the world. "What does it mean to be 'of the people'? What does it mean to be 'by the people'? What does it mean to be 'for the people'?" deBessonet said. "You know, all three of those are important, and were important in the founding of Public Works. I think that contains the essence of -- the dream of the Public Theater."
They've all had to move on from the dream, to the hard realities of stewardship, with the various public-facing challenges of raising money, dealing with boards, trying to program seasons that will attract paying customers. This has not been without bumps: Ybarra, for example, ran into stiff opposition in Baltimore as she tried to introduce more diversity into the company's art and artists.
"I'm not worried about the art at all, it's just going to thrive, it's going to find its way into the corners in which it happens," Wang said of creating, with the artistic director Bill Rauch, a fresh arts portfolio at the Perelman. The center, now in its inaugural season, has its first bona fide hit in "Cats: The Jellicle Ball," a radical reinterpretation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, based on T.S. Eliot's poems.
The bigger concern? "It's making the case for folks to get out of their homes and into environments and being present," she said. "This idea of welcoming, of belonging, of excitement, it's like, how do you just create that? And that is for me the task at hand."
Around a banquette, the women sipped wines and seltzers and munched on guacamole and talked this past spring about the endless Monday night fund-raising galas and upcoming vacations and much more. The overturning of Harvey Weinstein's New York conviction, and analyses of court actions limiting the right to abortion, were in the news. I lamely suggested as evidence of theater world progress that seven of the 10 Tony Award nominations for best director -- of both a play and a musical -- went to women this year.
"What's going on there?" I asked. The table erupted in laughter.
"Rollback?" someone said. "Rollback of women's rights?" said someone else.
"This is a good reminder that women need to be winning, running all the things," Thake said.
Steering back to what the group was all about, I asked: "What do you each think when you see the other four?"
"I think," Goyanes said, "of texting people and being like, 'Can we go outside? We need to talk!"'
For Ybarra, a particular memory comes to mind: "I have these really clear visuals of me and Lear standing together in whatever that office space was, and just being like: 'How are you? You better do this thing, and I got to do this thing. ..."'
And so the conversation flowed. It felt as if no one wanted it to end. Among these comrades in arts, it also felt as if it never would.

Sweeping Her Off Her Feet Took Some Time: [Society Desk]

Full text: Madison Chock and Evan Bates found chemistry when she picked him to be her ice dance partner in 2011. Then they found even more.
Madison La'akea Te-Lan Hall Chock and Evan Christian Bates have had a long, intense journey together as skating partners for the last 13 years. They have competed in more than 100 competitions globally and won five U.S. national champion titles, two world champion titles and one Olympic gold medal at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.
But the biggest moment of their lives, they said, took place on June 20: exchanging leis as they said "I do" at the Lanikuhonua Cultural Institute in Oahu, Hawaii.
They decided to get married there to honor Ms. Chock's Hawaiian heritage. The venue is a cultural institute dedicated to the preservation of Hawaiian culture.
The couple met 18 years ago in Michigan, "the mecca for ice dance at that time," Ms. Chock said.
Ms. Chock, who grew up in Redondo Beach, Calif., moved to Novi, Mich., in 2005, at age 13, to transition from singles figure skating to ice dancing, which requires a partner. Mr. Bates was living in Ann Arbor, where he grew up.
They trained at different skating rinks that were about 20 minutes away from each other, but the ice dance community was a small one. They met some time in 2006.
Both were flourishing with their ice skating partners. Mr. Bates, now 35, and his partner were world junior champions in 2008. Ms. Chock, 31, and her partner won in 2009.
In 2010, after competing in his first Winter Olympics, Mr. Bates's Achilles' tendon was severed by his partner's skate blade. He was off the ice for a year. Around the same time, Ms. Chock's dance partner retired from skating.
So, in 2011, they both found themselves looking for a new partner. At the time, they were training at the same rink in Canton, Mich., under the same coach. A few different ice skaters auditioned to become Ms. Chock's partner, including Mr. Bates.
"I sort of just waited to see if she was going to pick me," Mr. Bates said. And she did. They officially became dance partners in July 2011.
The two have a foot-long height difference, which isn't typical for ice dance partners. Many people were giving the pair grief, Mr. Bates said, "but we just really hit it off, enjoying our time together, always laughing and joking. The chemistry was really good."
It took five years for their partnership to become romantic. Outside of skating, they had separate lives. For the first few years of their partnership, Mr. Bates was attending the University of Michigan, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in organizational behavior. Ms. Chock had her own social life in Novi.
They developed a solid relationship on ice, practicing five hours a day. They also competed about once a month worldwide. They bonded during their travels, competing in Russia, China, Taiwan, France, Canada and many other countries. Their first trip together was to Helsinki, Finland, in October 2011, a few months after they became partners, for the Finlandia Trophy, an international competition.
The duo took time to find their footing; in June 2014, they took a trip to Hawaii and trained in acrobatics for the first time. There, they started developing the skills that they are now known for, including their distinctive lifts. They began to see a turn in their performance at competitions. And in 2014, they went to their first Olympics together in Sochi, Russia.
The 2014 Winter Olympics, set by the Black Sea, was a particularly exciting experience for the two. "You get there and it's just overwhelming: Everything's so big and colorful, and it's just a melting pot of interesting athletes and people," Mr. Bates said. "And there are all these parties."
During one competition, they did a program to "Les Misérables," the dramatic love story. As ice dancers, the partners would often act out roles -- including as lovers for romantic programs.
"I realized it wasn't really that difficult because I really did feel those strong emotions for Maddie," Mr. Bates said.
They also skated to "An American in Paris," another romantic film, at the 2015 World Figure Skating Championships in Shanghai, China, where they received a silver medal and stepped on the podium at a world championship competition for the first time. That year was their breakthrough year. They also won their first national title at the 2015 U.S. Figure Skating Championships.
Despite seeing more success in competitions, the 2016 season was a particularly tough one for the duo. They were reaching roadblocks creatively.
"I remember going through periods of being really unhappy on the ice, even though we were having success," Mr. Bates said. "And I realized that Maddie was really just my rock through everything,"
He turned 27 that year, and had the realization that what they had was more than just a professional relationship. "I really felt like I wasn't going to be able to not make it known," he said.
"I felt like there was always something there -- a spark," he added. "But we always kept it professional. After five years of highs and lows together as partners, he confessed his feelings.
"He took me by surprise," Ms. Chock said, even though the people around them had always been suspicious that there was something more between them. "But then at the same time, I wasn't surprised. I was like, 'Oh, actually I have feelings for you, too."'
She had just never thought about him as a romantic prospect before. "That was something in my head: I'm never going to date my skating partner. It's just not in the cards for me," Ms. Chock said. "And now look at me."

After he confessed his feelings for her in 2016, they treaded carefully. They were preparing for the 2018 Winter Olympics, thinking that it might be their last Olympics together, given the typical career length of skaters. ("We wouldn't have ever guessed that we would still be skating in 2024," Mr. Bates said.)
That summer, they toured with Stars on Ice, a figure skating show produced by IMG. They were on the road for six weeks, traveling to different cities in the country. They were getting a feel for each other in a new way. Finally, in December, during a trip to Paris around Christmas time after a competition in Marseilles, they made their relationship official.
From there, they went from spending half their time together to all their time together. They started having dates at restaurants and movie theaters. Mr. Bates also introduced Ms. Chock to video games. She played Zelda, Hogwarts Legacy and Animal Crossing. "Now she's the gamer," Mr. Bates said.
Since becoming romantically involved, the couple have learned to balance their personal and professional partnerships.
"When we get on the ice, we're a little bit more driven," Mr. Bates said. "We have an edge." They have learned to let the other person show their competitive, fiery side on ice. They also have developed an understanding that they each have different roles and "shouldn't be occupying each other's space and trying to do each other's job," Ms. Chock said.
Mr. Bates is a bit more pragmatic, coming from a technical background, and Ms. Chock is more artistic -- though they've both picked up on the other's skills over time. Ms. Chock has been drawing her costumes since they started skating together. Now, she designs for other skaters as well with Madison Chock Design, a label she debuted in 2023.
In 2018, the couple moved to Montreal, where they started working with their current coaches, Marie-France Dubreuil and Patrice Lauzon. Their coaches are also former ice dancers who are now married to each other. Having them as mentors has helped the couple overcome the new challenges they started facing since becoming romantically involved.
On June 11, 2022, Mr. Bates proposed in Phuket, Thailand, with an antique Cartier diamond ring. The 6/11 date had significance: "Six years of dating, 11 years of skating together. And I'd love to spend the rest of my life with you," Mr. Bates said as he got down on one knee.
On June 20, the couple were married in front of 90 guests by Steffany Hanlen, who was ordained by the Universal Life Church for the occasion. Ms. Hanlen led the Ho'oponopono prayer, an ancient Hawaiian healing prayer. Mr. Bates's brother was his best man, and his 4-year-old nephew was the ring bearer. Ms. Chock's best friend, Sarah Cojocaru, was her maid of honor.
After the 2026 Olympics in Italy, the couple are excited to start planning for their future post-skating, and to spend quality time with family after a career's worth of sacrificing family time and holidays.
For now, though, they're excited to finish their final seasons competitively together with a bang, and to "enjoy what we do -- performing," Ms. Chock said. "As a married couple."

Vera Wang For her wedding dress, Ms. Chock worked with Vera Wang, who was present during fittings. Her father wore a matching tuxedo. "It was a dream come true," Ms. Chock said about collaborating with the designer. "Ever since I was growing up skating and designing my costumes, I was always inspired by Vera and her dresses. She also made skating costumes for Michelle Kwan and Evan Lysacek. She's a fixture in fashion, bridal fashion and skating fashion."
Madison Chock Design Ms. Chock designed much of her ensemble for the wedding week. She worked with her skating costume maker, Mathieu Caron, for an outfit for the welcome event, which took place June 18: a corseted tube top and a draped ivory silk skirt. She also worked with Mr. Caron for the second look for the after-party: a slip dress embroidered with palm leaves and beaded fringe.
Celebrating Hawaiian Culture Ms. Chock's father walked her down the aisle, and her mother sang the traditional Hawaiian Wedding Song during the ceremony. The couple incorporated Hawaiian culture into their celebration with floral décor and food. They served traditional dishes like pork belly, poke, yuzu scallops and shaved ice.

Full text: Once Timothy Murray landed a date with Michael Bullard, the two were inseparable -- except when they were separated by their work as actors.
Despite his best efforts, Timothy Raymond Murray could not get Michael Alexander Hoy Bullard to give him the time of day -- that is, until a mutual friend intervened.
The two met in November 2014. Mr. Bullard was a bartender at Bareburger in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan. Mr. Murray would often sit at the bar and write.
Mr. Bullard paid him no attention at first. But when a mutual friend, Melanie Brook, formally introduced them there one night, "the flirting began," Mr. Murray said.
The two connected on social media, and, for the next two years, Mr. Murray would casually reach out on Facebook and twice asked Mr. Bullard on a date. Both times Mr. Bullard was out of town. They also ran into each other a couple times on the subway, discovering they both lived in Harlem. Mr. Murray again suggested getting together -- twice.
"I had no excuses," Mr. Bullard said of the final invitation, a Facebook message on Nov. 21, 2016.
That night the two went to a bar called At the Wallace in Harlem. "We just clicked," Mr. Murray said. After quite a few drinks, Mr. Bullard said to Mr. Murray, "You live nearby right?" He did and they headed there to continue the evening.
The following day, the two left separately to visit family for Thanksgiving. They texted constantly the week they were apart.
Mr. Murray, 36, is a stand-up comedian with a growing TikTok presence of more than 100,000 followers. He also teaches improv in rehabilitation centers and mental health facilities. Mr. Murray tours worldwide in a one-man show he created called "Tim Murray is Witches." He grew up in Sandusky, Ohio, and has a bachelor's degree in theater from the University of Miami.
Mr. Bullard, 33, is an actor and performer. He is currently a vacation swing for the Broadway production of Disney's "Aladdin." This July he will perform in St. Louis at the Muny in "Fiddler on the Roof," before returning to "Aladdin" in the fall. He grew up in Saranac Lake, N.Y., and has a bachelor's degree in theater performance from Wagner College.
The two returned to New York at the end of the holiday weekend. Mr. Bullard's birthday was Dec. 1, and the following night, "I was throwing a party for myself with all my friends there," he said. "When everyone left, I drunk sexted Tim to come over."
For their third date, a couple weeks later, Mr. Murray took Mr. Bullard to a "fancy dinner," as he called it, at an Upper West Side restaurant that they no longer remember the name of and is now closed.

That night, Mr. Bullard told Mr. Murray that he had just been cast in the touring production of "Aladdin" and would be on the road for a year. "Tim was thrilled for me," Mr. Bullard said. They soon became a couple.
Mr. Bullard said to Mr. Murray not too long after: "You're like this buoy in wavy water. You make me feel so safe and I know I love you." Mr. Murray responded in kind.
Mr. Murray visited Mr. Bullard while he was on tour and even moved in with him in Los Angeles for three months, from Jan. 1 to April 1. "We discovered this was a forever romance," Mr. Murray said.
But then life took a tough turn for the pair. On April 8, 2018, Mr. Bullard suffered a serious injury while skiing in Denver and required knee surgery. "Tim dropped everything and came to Denver," Mr. Bullard said.
Following surgery, Mr. Murray suggested Mr. Bullard recover in Los Angeles with him. So, he did, in a two-bedroom apartment with a roommate for 11 months. Once Mr. Bullard had healed, he went back on tour and Mr. Murray shadowed him with his own stand-up tour.
They rode out the first 18 months of the pandemic in Los Angeles. When the world began to reopen in September 2021, Mr. Bullard made his Broadway debut in "Aladdin" while Mr. Murray was working in Los Angeles. Still, Mr. Murray said, "We just knew in our hearts we would find a way to make this work."
On Nov. 26, 2022, Mr. Murray proposed with an escape room he crafted in their apartment and neighborhood in Los Angeles. "We have done over 50 of them together," Mr. Murray said. (The couple split their time between Los Angeles and New York.)
The two were wed May 18 by Jeenie Yoon, a mutual friend who was previously ordained by Universal Life Church Ministries, at Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga, Calif. Lissa Rubin, also a mutual friend, participated in the ceremony.
Mr. Murray wore a light blue double-breasted suit with pinstripe rhinestones designed by Justin Farnham. "I told him I wanted to look like Nicole Kidman in the AMC commercials," Mr. Murray said.
Mr. Bullard made his own fashion statement. "I had a crazy idea to look like an elven, Lord of the Rings, Legend of Zelda inspired ethereal forest fantasy prince." Timothy Westbrook, a Brooklyn-based designer from Mr. Bullard's hometown, made his dream a reality.
"People often talk about cold feet," Mr. Murray said. "But I couldn't believe how hot my feet felt looking at him."

Full text: In a strong month for indie games, Hauntii is a hunt for memories and Crow Country offers retro survival in a creepy amusement park. The origami-like Paper Trail feels a bit thin.
In a month rife with original indie games, including Animal Well and Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, there has seemingly been something for every player. The creativity continues with Hauntii, Crow Country and Paper Trail, even though one stumbles a bit.
Hauntii
The inventive characters in Hauntii speak few words, but those words can pierce. "I hate you," one cute devil says after you climb meandering steps to reach him.
This 10-hour adventure game by the studio Moonloop can be slightly subversive as well, all the while musing upon what the afterlife means. Hauntii, a tiny, faceless Druid-esque being, embarks upon his trek energetically. But the point of his cowl hood droops behind his head, perhaps from the sheer weight of finding out he's died.
In this invitingly artful, mostly monochromatic world, Hauntii soon meets an Eternian, seemingly an angel with flowing hair. Hauntii's green eyes become wide with attraction. She lifts him to the heavens, where they ascend hand in hand to observe sparkling constellations -- a wonderful representation of love at first sight.
As it can be with relationships, she leaves. To find her, it's key to remember who you once were by collecting lustrous stars hidden among trees or locked away in cages. As you search, the characters encourage you to stay in their world, a place where you can always be safe. There's nothing good where the Eternian is, they caution.
Yet it's not safe where you are either.
A giant, chained Bell Guardian, its mouth twisted down like a Melpomene mask of tragedy, employs minions to kill you. Hopping beings that look like Q-bert with legs might stomp on you. With haunt ability, I inhabited these trumpet-nosed creatures to jump quickly past enemies. If you stray from your appointed path into a roadless blackness, red eyes appear nightmarishly. Linger for too long, and you'll lose your life.
Haunting to shake pine trees reveals pieces of hearts for health, and an occasional brilliant star. Collect enough and you're lofted into the heavens to complete a constellation. From high in space, silent stick figure vignettes appear to show momentary hints of your life, like tender parental hugs after being bullied by a teacher. That these memories have so much emotional impact is a credit to the creators.
Hauntii's most gobsmacking achievement is the Wickland Carnival. On the midway, a gangly grim reaper sells ride tickets in exchange for a portion of your soul. The line is long with adults and children, all happily queuing up to sell their very essence. As the camera pulls back, the long shot reveals a spectacular roller coaster that rumbles at the north end, looping twice as it's bathed in fireworks and its harried passengers scream gleefully. Gaining admission to the rickety ride is another puzzle Hauntii needs to solve before his journey through Eternity is complete.
Crow Country
A homage to the original PlayStation era, Crow Country is made for nostalgia lovers who don't mind graphics that aren't presented in 4K, and who love a puzzle game that requires concentration and note taking. It is especially inspired by Resident Evil, from 1996, the console's classic survival horror game.
Here, you are Mara Forest, a brown-haired investigator in a white dress who searches for the missing entrepreneur Mr. Crow. She's a no-nonsense, generally delightful presence who has limited ammo to protect herself from the grossly mutated creatures that appear in an abandoned amusement park, the eponymous Crow Country.
Inside, the overall mood is creepy rather than horrifying. Eeriness pervades. The soundtrack, full of long, tense notes and gruesome screams, gets under your skin. Nothing is really as it appears. There's the mechanical Great Fairy of Fairest Forest, which spins around to reveal a walkway once the proper code is entered, leading to more disturbing denizens. A tiny house requires crawling on hands and knees like Lewis Carroll's Alice.
The puzzles in Crow Country, from SFB Games, move from simple to quite complex, and there's much backtracking hither and yon for clues and items to aid your tasks. I used a reporter's notebook to write down hints that the park's staff members left on the walls. The world map is quite extensive with its many rooms, goony surprises and mild humor. One area is called the Mush Room. Inside, the Mushroom King sits alone at a long, dark dining table with unlit candles.
The mutated beings often come from the grim shadows. Shooting them with a laser-guided pistol isn't always accurate. And turning to run away using the D-pad is a learning experience. (If you merely want to explore Crow Country's many appealing peculiarities without fear of being attacked, there's a mode that stops mutants from appearing.)
Yet the primary answer to the mystery is one you might overlook. If you miss checking your inventory to read a crumpled yellow paper that Mr. Crow handed over during the 10-hour game's finale, you won't realize the potentially dire situation the world may encounter in the future. One eerie battle is won. But the indication is that there may be more later, thus setting up a potential sequel.
Paper Trail
In Paper Trail, a top-down fairy tale, you fold, unfold and fold again until a path is revealed to pass an obstacle in a world rendered in moody watercolor backgrounds. I quickly recalled my childhood distractions like folding paper into planes and more intricate origami but ultimately became flummoxed by all the folding.
Here in the seaside community of Southfold, a lightning storm complete with damaging winds wreaks havoc, and the eel fisherman who has been trapped because a bridge crumbled asks for assistance. Dragging and folding the game's edges as if the screen were a piece of paper, you discover a new way to traverse.
For some reason, the fisherman worries whether Aunt Maude survived the storm. How does he know her? Do they have a secret relationship? It's not revealed, but the puzzles become more intricate from there.
Maude has been eating pine cones because she's been trapped by the squall's damage. That's when Paige, an 18-year-old aspiring astrophysicist whose parents don't want her to leave for college, comes to the rescue.
Paper Trail, an eight-hour experience by Newfangled Games, is published by Netflix and playable on smartphones and all major consoles. I chose to indulge on Nintendo's Switch because of the larger touch-screen. It's not always easy, however, to pull portions of the screen to lead Paige to a new path. It's more difficult when the virtual paper edges sometimes become stuck, regardless of the hint button's how-to diagrams.
Paige moves though some compelling environments, beautifully detailed and inked like a children's book. I particularly lingered over a sunset pond just outside a cave in which she takes refuge. Fold the edges properly to reveal a green-hued morning with a white antlered stag far in the distance.
After journeys through swamps and snow, Paige eventually gets to college. Despite the apparent symbolism that the path to higher education isn't always an easy one, this trek wasn't always worth the effort. The story is paper thin and the origami-influenced gameplay mechanic doesn't always bend the space-time continuum.
Hauntii was reviewed on a PC and is also available on all major consoles. Crow Country was reviewed on the PlayStation 5 and is also available on the PC and Xbox Series X|S. Paper Trail was reviewed on the Switch and is also available on all major consoles and smartphones.

This Puzzle Game's Influences Reach Beyond Resident Evil: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In addition to its gaming influences, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes contains traces of postmodern novels and the French New Wave.
The puzzle game Lorelei and the Laser Eyes opens with the protagonist -- a well-dressed woman with the solemnity of a catwalk model -- inside a forest where boreal owls roam. Ahead looms a secluded hotel whose secrets include art exhibits, mathematical puzzles and a pettable Labrador.
That mysterious estate, which has its roots in horror games like Resident Evil, is a place shaped as much by its own architecture as by character psychology and surrealism.
In addition to reflections about the medium itself, Lorelei contains traces of postmodern novels and the cinema of the French New Wave. The video game is "like wandering in memories and dreams," said Simon Flesser, one of the founders of the game's developer, Simogo.
Simogo has acknowledged an eclectic list of inspirations, including "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," "Twin Peaks: The Return," The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening and John Fowles's 1965 novel, "The Magus."
Other references include the parallel realities in Paul Auster's fiction and the enigmas of "Last Year at Marienbad," an Alain Resnais film from the early 1960s in which characters explore palatial spaces and contemplate the past. (The name of the game's hotel is Letztes Jahr, which is German for "Last Year.")
The minigames within Lorelei almost included Nim, an ancient combinatorial game that appears in "Last Year at Marienbad." In the film, memories intrude and elude; interpersonal dynamics shift unpredictably, like Nim's matchsticks. Yesterday's pastime is tomorrow's existential crisis.
"It's a labyrinth of a movie," Flesser said. "You always have new ideas about what it is. And I think that's a thing that we want for this game."
Lorelei, which is available on the PC and the Switch, has a metatextual quality. Glimpses of the past emerge in vignettes modeled after retro computer games, and stashed within the hotel are documents about a piece of software called Lorelei and the Laser Eyes.
"Media and entertainment become their own realities," Flesser said. "We sort of find ourselves in them."
The developer Sam Barlow, whose own work combines interactivity, literature and cinema, is a fan of Simogo's games. He viewed Lorelei as a story about trying to remember, and said he was intrigued by its ritualistic use of motifs. A set of fetishized years in Lorelei are connected to many puzzle-related objects, including piano keys, a grandfather clock and the gates to an orangery.
Playing the game is akin to a compulsive turning over of details, a retracing of past events involving a fateful collaboration with a filmmaker -- and a subterranean supercomputer.
In one kinetic series of puzzles, the player uses movie cameras to find patterns hidden in art installations.
According to the game's twisty story, these decades-old installations were created by an artist named Lorelei Weiss. Curiously, an older Weiss seems to reside in the hotel as a bedridden convalescent. Then again, Flesser says the characters are never unambiguously identified.
"There's a thesis at play in the game that is connecting the high and low arts and is going, look, 'There is actually a huge similarity between the puzzle-box mansion of a Resident Evil and an art installation,"' Barlow said.
With its locked doors and elegant interiors, the manor of the first Resident Evil (1996) is at once a brain-teasing riddle and an artisanal spectacle. The player must study, use and repurpose objects; vestiges of the past haunt the halls.
The similarities with Lorelei do not end there. As with the early Resident Evil games, most of the camera positions in Lorelei are fixed and cinematic. Elsewhere, looser camerawork tracks the protagonist as the player guides her past the rippling walls of a maze. Flesser said he was interested in what a camera could be in the video game sphere.
"It feels like we've just said: 'OK, we've solved the 3-D camera now, just let the player control the camera,"' Flesser said.
(The filmmaker Gus Van Sant has also pondered the potential of video game cameras, noting the way the camera in Tomb Raider, the 1996 game, "swings and swims around, always keeping the central figure somewhere in the middle of the frame." He dreamed of bringing this effect into a live-action film.)
Far-flung reference points, such as those seen in Lorelei, enliven the video game form.
Barlow's 2022 game, Immortality, adapts M.G. Lewis's 1796 novel "The Monk," and he wants to see a game that thoughtfully captures the "shifting-sands feel" of "Ubik," Philip K. Dick's bewildering 1969 novel. In its sci-fi world, time and reality become unruly things; even mundane objects can suddenly change.
Barlow's emphasis on the novel's precise "feel" and "texture" signals an open-minded perspective, one in which other works are not properties to mine for cachet or profit, but catalysts for surprising artistic combinations.
"The No. 1 way you can differentiate yourself is through your inspirations and your research," Barlow said. "Going and finding interesting things."

Critic, Review Thyself: A Video Game Pundit Turns Publisher: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: After a decade of humorously reviewing games, the man known as Dunkey began a publishing company to support indie projects, starting with the mazelike Animal Well.
Freewheeling assessments of the gaming industry have attracted millions of fans to the YouTube reviews of the personality nicknamed Dunkey, whose self-deprecating humor sweetens his critiques of popular video games.
"Kirby is a lot like me," he said while reviewing the pink puffball's latest adventure. "He is a big fat guy that sucks up all the food."
"I'm just a referee on this one so you cannot get mad," he explained in a middling review of Spider-Man 2, aware of the game's rabid fan base.
"This is an evil game made by an evil man," he proclaimed about Elden Ring's difficulty. "And whoever's job it was to balance the damage-scaling on enemies did not show up for work."
Now Dunkey, whose real name is Jason Gastrow, is hoping to parlay his 14-year rise as an entertaining critic into a serious business publishing indie games, something few influencers have attempted.
On Thursday, his publishing company, Bigmode, released its first game, Animal Well, in which a mysterious blob explores a complex labyrinth while encountering animals that might help or hinder its journey. Billy Basso spent seven years making the game, which relies on well-designed puzzles and hidden secrets to motivate players and has generated extra attention because of Dunkey.
A few days before the game released on the PC, PlayStation 5 and Switch, Gastrow posted a YouTube video in which he encourages players within Counter-Strike and VRChat to put Animal Well on their wish list.
"He has a specific taste," said Leah Gastrow, his wife and business partner, who answered questions on behalf of her husband, describing him as press shy. "It has happened time and again where he picks up a game before it has found mainstream success."
(He gave the 2018 game Celeste, now considered an indie classic, an early rave.)
Game reviewing on YouTube and Twitch is a thriving subculture, with influencers often sponsored by companies to promote their titles in exchange for money.
"The issue comes when influencers are not necessarily adhering to journalistic ethics," said Ash Parrish, a staff writer at The Verge who covers games. "Dunkey gets around that because he is unafraid to say something is bad; in fact, people like hearing him say that."
Jason Gastrow says he does not take sponsorship deals to review games. His ability to criticize without scorching the earth behind him has resulted in nearly 7.5 million subscribers on YouTube, where his logo is a donkey wearing sunglasses and smoking a large cigar.
He has also become an unassuming luminary in the gaming industry -- someone elected as Wisconsin's top celebrity in a public vote held by The Milwaukee Record, beating the football coach Curly Lambeau and the actor Gene Wilder.
Animal Well, part of the Metroidvania genre known for its mazelike structures, caught the attention of the Gastrows at the industry event Summer Game Fest in 2022, about the time the couple were discussing plans for their company. Bigmode, which is also publishing Star of Providence, a retro top-down shooter, wants to raise the profile of indie games that reflect the founders' tastes but not necessarily the dominant trends of larger studios.
For Animal Well, Basso worked alone for nearly 80 hours each week to design its game engine, animations, music and more, relying on savings he earned at large studios like NetherRealm, the developer behind the Mortal Kombat series. He said Bigmode's feedback improved the gameplay experience.
"Every time that I update the game, they play through from scratch," Basso said. "The big beats of the game don't really change that much. Maybe it's the order you do things or adding visual clues to let players know that certain things are possible."
Bigmode made only one major request during the development cycle, Leah Gastrow said: Put more animals into the well.
Basso agreed, adding dozens of animals with distinctive animations and interactions. A kangaroo stomps the ground, a sea horse creates helpful platforms with bubbles, and a rabbit seems to guide the player's way.
The marketing for Animal Well began in earnest when Jason Gastrow introduced himself as "funny man Videogamedunkey" during last year's Nintendo showcase for independent developers. As Basso spoke about his game, one "filled with puzzles that you would want to keep coming back to over and over again," Gastrow intentionally stumbled into a pond of quacking ducks behind him.
A thriving Discord channel soon emerged in which players tried to decipher any subliminal content behind each frame of promotional videos. The mysteriousness was part of the publicity strategy by Dan Adelman, who is leading Animal Well's business development.
"It is a difficult game to market because you cannot communicate its secrets," Adelman said. "You cannot communicate how good it feels to play."
The deepest secrets are encrypted. In an interview with Game File, Basso explained that a hacker would need "quantum computers" to access the information without playing Animal Well as intended.
"It is very artistically handled from start to finish," Leah Gastrow said. "And we will put whatever we can into producing to get this game out to more people."

Manhattan's Newest Star Spreads Her Wings: [National Desk]

Full text: The wild turkey wandered into Midtown Manhattan this week, so far evading attempts to capture her. You may find her at Saks Fifth Avenue, high-end Italian restaurants or roosting in nearby trees.
Manhattan has a new unlikely feathered friend, and she's visiting luxury retailers, dining at high-end restaurants and roosting in Park Avenue's densest, greenest trees.
Known as Astoria, the wild turkey is about as tall as a toddler, with iridescent hues of orange and blue in her brown feathers, an elegant neck, a healthy figure and wings that have helicopter-like strength. Her unusual appearance in Manhattan this week has once again drummed up excitement, bemusement and a growing following of New Yorkers fascinated by the wild fowl's adventures -- and concerned for its safety -- in the Big Apple.
She has so far eluded capture.
David Barrett, a birder who runs the Manhattan Bird Alert account on X, was out in Central Park with his camera when he received an alert from a birding website after 5 p.m. on Tuesday about a wild turkey sighting in Midtown Manhattan. He headed to the corner of 49th Street and Park Avenue, where he said the bird nestled in a planter outside of Fasano, a high-end Italian restaurant.
Not everyone noticed Astoria: Her brown coloring provides some camouflage amid the shrubs. But she did draw some admirers, eager to document a rare sighting with professional cameras and smartphones. "It's the only turkey we've had in a long time," Mr. Barrett said.
Manhattan is no stranger to celebrity birds. Flaco the Owl roamed free around Manhattan for a year, mostly spending his time in Central Park and capturing the attention of New Yorkers and others, after fleeing the Central Park Zoo. Other famous fowl include Pale Male, a red-tailed hawk, and Barry the barred owl.
The fowl that most Americans link to Thanksgiving is more common in the Bronx or on Staten Island, where turkeys can be somewhat of a nuisance. Astoria is not the first wild turkey to wander into Manhattan: Zelda was a wild turkey who made Battery Park her home for more than a decade and even survived Hurricane Sandy before she died in 2014. Another wild turkey was spotted in Central Park in April 2017.
There are some questions about Astoria, including how she arrived in Manhattan. Some birders and other experts are fairly certain that she came over from Queens, where she may have been spotted in late April foraging in a community garden in Long Island City, pointing to her plumage and coloring as a perfect match. That's also how she earned her name, Astoria.
Most likely, Astoria flew across the East River, making a pit stop either on Roosevelt Island or the Queensboro Bridge. She may have even walked across the bridge. Where she was before Queens is a mystery, but whatever her path, Astoria seems quite pleased with Midtown as her base.
She has largely stayed close to 49th Street and Park Avenue, eating blueberries presented to her by the staff at Fasano, exploring the avenue's median and foraging in other nearby planters for juicy worms. At night, she roosts in trees. On Wednesday evening, Astoria checked out Saks Fifth Avenue, a New York landmark known for its luxury designers. David Lei, a birder and photographer who has closely followed Astoria, said she perched atop the awning. A store associate suggested that Astoria should be invited to next year's Met Gala.
It appears that even Astoria is becoming fascinated by herself. Mr. Lei said he had observed Astoria admiring her own reflection in some mirrored pillars at 280 Park Avenue, an office building. "She is very cute actually," Mr. Lei said, adding that "people don't typically describe turkeys as cute."
But her relaxed, calm demeanor is also cause for concern. Though Astoria has mostly trotted along the sidewalk or flown across the street, there have been close encounters with traffic. Several birders have had to escort her across the street, much to the aggravation of some cabbies.
There have been attempts to safely rescue her. The Wild Bird Fund, which runs a rehabilitation center in Manhattan, made an attempt on Wednesday using two blankets, a large hand-held net, a box and assistance from other bystanders, said Rita McMahon, the fund's director. Ms. McMahon said her organization -- which typically does not perform such operations -- had previously rescued a wild turkey along Columbus Avenue by encircling it. But that bird was sick, she said, and not as vibrant, healthy or full-feathered as Astoria.
"She is such an athlete -- she just went straight up," Ms. McMahon said, estimating that the bird soared about 10 feet above their heads. "She looked at us and said, 'I have no trouble flying over your reach."'
Ms. McMahon advises against feeding Astoria, because that will encourage her to stay. The hope for now is that she finds a safe area, rather than roaming the city. "She really is under her own navigation," Ms. McMahon said.
Her appearance itself is a sign of the success of conservationists' efforts to restore and protect wild turkeys, whose populations have rebounded after they were hunted nearly to extinction in the 19th century, according to the New York City Audubon.
Early Friday morning, birders including Mr. Lei and Mr. Barrett were waiting for a dry moment to go check on Astoria at her last known location in a tree near 51st Street and Park Avenue, close to St. Bartholomew's Church. She flew there after a failed capture attempt Thursday evening, they said.
Where she'll go next is as big a question as any.
Maybe Astoria will discover Central Park nearby and make a life there. Or maybe a crew will rescue her and transport her to the Bronx or Staten Island, removing her from the concrete environs of Midtown but allowing her to remain a New Yorker.

Markets' Lull Stretches to a Second Day With a Mixed Finish: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street's lull stretched into a second day, as U.S. stocks drifted to a mixed close in a quiet Wednesday.
The S&P 500 finished virtually unchanged after flipping between modest gains and losses through the day. It edged down by 0.03 percent to 5,187.67. It was coming off a very slight gain from Tuesday, which followed a big three-day winning streak.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 172.13 points, or 0.4 percent, to 39,056.39, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 29.80, or 0.2 percent, to 16,302.76.
Uber Technologies slumped 5.7 percent after reporting worse results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also gave a forecasted range for bookings in the current quarter whose midpoint fell below analysts' estimates.
Shopify tumbled 18.6 percent despite reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which helps businesses sell things online, said its revenue growth would likely slow this quarter and that it would likely make less profit off each $ 1 in revenue.
Match Group sank 5.4 percent despite topping profit expectations. The company behind Tinder, Hinge and other apps for connecting people gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that fell short of analysts'. It said its efforts to make Tinder better for women and Gen Z customers in particular have hurt some performance measurements in the short term.
Intel fell 2.2 percent after saying the U.S. Commerce Department revoked licenses for exports to a Chinese customer. That could cause its revenue for the current quarter to fall below the midpoint of the forecasted range it had earlier given.
Those decliners helped to offset Lyft, which revved 7.1 percent higher after it topped expectations for profit and revenue. It said growth was particularly strong for early-morning, commute and weekend-evening trips.
Reddit was another winner and rose 4 percent after delivering its first quarterly report as a publicly traded company. It reported a milder loss and better revenue than expected, while also giving a stronger-than-expected forecast for revenue in the current quarter.
Arista Networks climbed 6.5 percent for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after topping expectations for both profit and revenue.
Most companies have been reporting stronger profits for the start of the year than analysts expected. That and newly revived hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve have helped the U.S. stock market to recover from its rough April.
Treasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that it remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury recovered some of those losses. It rose to 4.50 percent from 4.46 percent late Tuesday.
The yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves closer with expectations for action by the Fed, ticked up to 4.84 percent from 4.83 percent.
The stock market also found some support following April's weakness as companies bought back more shares of their own stock, according to Mark Hackett, Nationwide's chief of investment research. He said the market's zigzag pattern since March "is likely to remain as we search for a catalyst."
In stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Asia. Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 1.6 percent after Nintendo forecast that its net profit would fall in the upcoming fiscal year and announced that news of a successor product to its popular Switch device will be made by March 2025.

Accepting Limits Liberates A Virtuoso: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The pianist Alice Sara Ott, who makes her New York Philharmonic debut this week, is upending concert culture -- and defying stereotypes about multiple sclerosis.
The pianist Alice Sara Ott, barefoot and wearing a silver bracelet, was smiling and singing to herself the other day as she practiced a jazzy passage of Ravel at Steinway Hall in Midtown Manhattan. A Nintendo Switch, which she uses to warm up her hands, was by her side (another favored tool is a Rubik's Cube). A shot of espresso sat untouched on the floor.
"I feel I have finally found my voice," Ott said during a break. "I feel I can finally be myself."
Ott, 35, who makes her New York Philharmonic debut this week, has built a global career, recording more than a dozen albums and appearing with top ensembles. She has become a force for change in classical music, embracing new approaches (playing Chopin on beat-up pianos in Iceland) and railing against stuffy concert culture (she performs without shoes, finding it more comfortable).
And Ott, who lives in Munich and has roots in Germany and Japan, has done so while grappling with illness. In 2019, when she was 30, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. She says she has not shown any symptoms since starting treatment, but the disorder has made her reflect on the music industry's grueling work culture.
"I learned to accept that there is a limit and to not go beyond that," she said. "Everybody knows how to ignore their body and just go on. But there's always a payback."
Ott has used her platform to help dispel myths about multiple sclerosis, a disorder of the central nervous system that can cause a wide range of symptoms, including muscle spasms, numbness and vision problems. She has taken to social media to detail her struggles and to challenge those who have suggested that the illness has affected her playing.
She said she felt she had no choice but to be transparent, saying it was important to show that people with multiple sclerosis could lead full lives.
"I don't consider it as a weakness," she said. "It's a fact. I live with it. And I don't want to make a big drama out of it."
Ott's colleagues describe her as an adventurous musician who has helped bring new audiences to classical music with experiments like "Echoes of Life," a project that blends Chopin preludes with contemporary works, video and Ott's reflections on life and music.
Bryce Dessner, a composer and a guitarist who wrote a concerto for Ott that she premiered in Zurich this year, said that "what she brings onstage is so specific to her -- it's like she's unlocking some sort of hidden doorway in each piece that she confronts or interprets."
The conductor Elim Chan, who performed with Ott a few months after she began treatment, said that from the start, Ott had a "don't baby me" attitude about her illness.
"She is able to go to a very beautiful and fragile place, but it's also very honest and it has integrity within it," Chan said. "And then she flies from there. And that is something I find very beautiful."
Ott was born in Munich to a Japanese mother, a piano teacher, and a German father, an electrical engineer. She began piano lessons at 4, drawn to the expressive power of music, she said, and when she was 12, she started commuting to Salzburg, Austria, to study with the renowned teacher Karl-Heinz Kämmerling.
After winning a series of prizes, her career took off, and at 19, she signed with the prestigious label Deutsche Grammophon. Still, she began to feel uneasy about classical music's emphasis on tradition in programming, concert formats and dress. She sometimes faced sexism; a colleague once told her to play a passage of Beethoven like a "cute little Japanese woman," she said. And her packed touring schedule was taking a toll on her as a musician, she said.
"I felt like people were expecting something from me that I could not provide," she said. "I was floating around, and I didn't have stability in the sense of who I was as an artist."
She began to forge her own path, working with artists like the experimental composer Ólafur Arnalds to record reimagined versions of Chopin. Eager for a more rugged sound, they went searching for out-of-tune pianos in bars in Reykjavik, Iceland.
In 2014, she released "Scandale," an homage to the Ballets Russes, with the pianist and composer Francesco Tristano, featuring works by Stravinsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Ravel and Tristano. On tour, they decorated the stage with magenta duct tape and invited the audience to clap along with the music.
"You can really hear the intelligence in the way she performs," Tristano said. "Nothing is left to randomness or sheer virtuosity. She's beyond that. She really wants to make a point about the music she's creating -- that it's relevant today."
In 2018, on tour in Japan, Ott began to experience health problems, feeling some numbness in her lips and later having difficulty walking.
Her doctors said her symptoms were probably caused by stress. But when she returned home to Munich after another tour a couple months later, half of her body went numb. After undergoing tests, she received her diagnosis: relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the most common form, in which symptoms can flare up and dissipate.
At first, Ott said, she was "scared as hell" and panicked. But she also worried about upsetting her family. "There were lots of times," she said, "when I just locked myself somewhere and cried."
Her only knowledge of the illness came from the story of Jacqueline du Pré, the British cellist who died in 1987, at 42, of complications from multiple sclerosis. On the day Ott received her diagnosis, she lost control of her left hand while playing a Chopin nocturne at a recital in Munich. She ran offstage, sat on the floor and cried, and canceled the rest of the concert.
But as Ott read about modern treatments, she grew more optimistic, especially since her illness was in the early stages. In February 2019, about a month after her diagnosis, she posted about it on Instagram.
"An acknowledgment is not a weakness," she wrote, "but a way to protect and gain strength, both for oneself and for those around us."
Ott was praised for her courage. When she toured, musicians approached her to share their experiences with multiple sclerosis. But her health challenges also drew scrutiny.
When a critic reviewing one of Ott's albums last fall suggested that its inclusion of some easier pieces was related to her multiple sclerosis, she shot back. On Instagram, she noted that she had explained her choice of repertoire and that she had plans for more albums. She said that such reductive labeling was "the exact reason why it's still so hard for many to come out and talk about their own conditions."

In New York, Ott will perform Ravel's Piano Concerto in G Major with the conductor Karina Canellakis, who is also making her Philharmonic debut, in a program that includes works by Webern, Strauss and Scriabin. (Last year, the two were featured performing Beethoven in advertisements for Apple Music Classical, the technology giant's streaming service.)
Canellakis said Ott had a "a serenity about her that is infectious."
"There's a sense of pure focus," she said, "and she inspires everyone else around her to assume that state of being."
Ott has been refining her interpretation of the Ravel concerto, which she first performed when she was 17, working to mimic the sound of jazz instruments in the piano part.
On a recent evening, she went to the Blue Note jazz club in Manhattan to hear the Japanese composer and pianist Hiromi. The concert felt intimate and laid-back, she said: People cheered freely, laughed, talked and shared food and drinks.
Ott said she strives to create similar connections with audiences.
"Music itself can only fully blossom when we unite in it," she said. "We have to be vulnerable. That is one of the most beautiful sources of togetherness and strength."

A Migrant Mother's Struggle To Win Back Her Young Son: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Over the final four months of 2021, Olga, a Honduran immigrant in Hollywood, Fla., grew increasingly panicked. She could not find her 5-year-old son, Ricardo. After she'd fled her homeland to escape her abusive husband, the man also migrated, disappeared with the boy and broke off contact.
By day, Olga lived her life. She cut, colored and styled hair at a Miami salon, chatting with clients as if she hadn't a care in the world. She mothered her 7-year-old daughter, Dariela, straining to distract her from the fact that her little brother was missing. But the nights were tough. "I cried into my pillow," Olga said. "Where was my sweet little boy? Was he, at least, safe?"
He was not.
By the time Olga, then 28, tracked her son to Massachusetts, he had been removed from his father over allegations of physical abuse. Calling office after office of the Department of Children and Families, she finally reached a woman who turned out to be Ricardo's caseworker.
"Who are you?" the woman said.
"Yo soy la mamá," Olga replied, bursting into tears.
In early January 2022, Olga, who asked that her last name be withheld to protect her children, flew to Boston. It would only be a matter of presenting evidence -- Ricardo's birth certificate, videos of him on her phone, DNA if necessary -- before she could take him home, she thought.
But when immigration and child welfare are involved -- two contentious issues and their beleaguered systems -- nothing is straightforward.
Under an interstate compact, Massachusetts formally asked Florida to approve the relocation. Florida said no. Though a caseworker found Olga to have a clean record, a proper home and sufficient income, she denied the move because Olga was not a legal U.S. resident.
Massachusetts does not consider undocumented status a reason to prevent reunification with a parent. But intensely cautious amid a scandal involving another child's death, the state's child protection authorities froze, sending Ricardo on a destabilizing odyssey through the foster care system. In a case that reveals the unique vulnerabilities of unauthorized immigrant parents, Olga risked losing her son forever.
Immigrant family separation did not start or stop with the Trump administration's thwarted "zero tolerance" policy. Now as before, and with record numbers of new unauthorized immigrants fanning out across the country, it happens more insidiously.
"When people think of family separation, they think of the Southern border and kids in cages," said Lori Nessel, director of an immigrant rights clinic at Seton Hall Law School in New Jersey. "But people don't realize how much this occurs every day in the interior of the country."
Like other poor parents, unauthorized immigrants encounter the chronic fallibility of state-run agencies in which Black and Hispanic children are overrepresented. They also tangle with the antiquated bureaucracy that governs the relocation of children across state lines.
But their status puts them at an additional disadvantage. They confront language and cultural barriers as well as limited access to services and benefits, fear of immigration enforcement, inadequate legal representation and, finally, anti-immigrant bias.
Additionally, many caseworkers and judges harbor the misconception that all unauthorized immigrants are on the brink of deportation, viewing their homes as inherently unstable. Yet fewer than 1 percent were removed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement last year.
Cristina Cooper, senior attorney with the American Bar Association's Center on Children and the Law, described Florida's decision in Olga's case as "shocking and harmful." Undocumented status alone does not make a parent unfit. And under the 14th Amendment, fit parents, regardless of immigration status, have a protected right to the care, custody and control of their children.
Asked whether it was now Florida's policy to refuse custody based on immigration status, Miguel Nevarez, press secretary for the state's Department of Children and Families, neither answered directly nor denied it. "Cases regarding one's legal or illegal status wouldn't exist if the federal government enforced our immigration laws," he said.
In Olga's case, that line of thinking trickled down to South Florida from Tallahassee, where Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill last spring that he proudly called "the strongest anti-illegal-immigration legislation in the country."
When Olga's advocates phoned her caseworker's supervisor, according to Nick Herbold, the boy's first foster father, the woman told them: "Hey, we're in Florida. She's undocumented. There's no concern about the home. There's no concern about safety with the mother. It's just the fact that politically we cannot sign off on it."
****
Olga never intended to be an undocumented immigrant. If she ever journeyed north, she thought, she would do so with a visa.
What changed her mind was something that propels many women to leave Honduras, according to a report by the Washington Office on Latin America: "domestic violence and a lack of resources for protections or aid."
Growing up near the Maya ruins of Copán, daughter of a tailor and a factory worker, Olga set her sights on a professional career. But in her first year studying law at the University of San Pedro Sula, she met Ricardo's father. (He did not respond to messages from The New York Times.) In her second year, she got pregnant and dropped out.
Even before they married, her boyfriend became volatilely "machista," she said. After their two children were born in quick succession, he turned physically abusive to her and Dariela. When she finally kicked him out, she didn't trust him to stay away.
Selling property, Olga raised $ 10,000, enough to pay the way to the United States for herself and one child. Leave Ricardo with me, her mother said, pledging to travel north with him later.
The journey was harrowing, but once Olga and Dariela were safely ensconced in a relative's spacious house in Coral Gables, Fla., Olga started to regret leaving the boy behind.
Still, Ricardo was fine with his grandmother -- until his father showed up and forcibly reclaimed him, Olga said. The man then traveled with Ricardo to the coffee fields of Hawaii and eventually disappeared with him into the vast U.S. mainland.
****
In mid-November 2021, Ricardo's father enrolled him in kindergarten at the Albert F. Argenziano School in Somerville, Mass. Four days later, Ricardo told his teacher that his body hurt. A child who idolizes superheroes, he willed himself not to cry as he revealed a vivid bruise on his leg and confided that his father beat him with a belt when he misbehaved.
Alarmed but not wanting to alarm the rest of the class, the teacher, Ilana Cohn, quietly asked her paraprofessional to take the small child with the soft brown eyes to the health office. Down the hall they went, sneakers squeaking on linoleum past a rainbow-decorated bulletin board that proclaimed: "YOU BELONG HERE! YOU MATTER!"
The nurse observed not only the contusion on Ricardo's leg but also other, fading bruises. She alerted the principal, Glenda Soto, that she would have to immediately report suspected abuse to the child welfare department.
"O Lord, give me strength," Ms. Soto said to herself. In her seven years as an administrator at Argenziano, an elementary school with nearly 600 students, she had dealt with only one case in which a child had to be taken from a parent.
Ricardo was whisked away for a forensic examination at Boston Children's Hospital. Christianne Sharr had just started there as a physician assistant, though she was not at work when her phone rang late that Thursday.
"We have an emergency removal," a foster care worker said. "The child needs a home tonight."
Ms. Sharr and her husband, Mr. Herbold, a software engineer, were new foster parents, having been eager during the pandemic "to do something hopeful when the world felt superheavy," she said.
At 3 a.m., a social worker delivered Ricardo to the porch of their Cambridge home. When he shifted the sleeping child into Ms. Sharr's arms, she studied his face and thought, "Oh, he's beautiful." After tucking him into bed, she kept vigil outside the bedroom until day broke and she heard him stir.
Leaping up, Ricardo ran to the window. "Papá! Papá!" he cried. He had been on the move for much of the year. Now, like his mother, he had no idea where he was.
****
On that first day, Mr. Herbold and Ms. Sharr whisked Ricardo away to a preplanned family gathering at a farm resort. In their hotel room, when he and Ms. Sharr were building block towers, he blurted, "Oh, you know what I want to tell you? I want to tell you that sometimes my dad scares me."
Ms. Sharr, fluent in Spanish, answered: "OK, tell me more."
"You know, he hit me here," Ricardo said, pointing to his leg. He tapped the nape of his neck. "There was one time he hit me here."
"Oh, my," Ms. Sharr said. "I'm so sorry that happened to you."
The following week, the Department of Children and Families, known as D.C.F., granted Ricardo's father a supervised visit at the school. When Ricardo saw his father, he collapsed, screaming and crying.
Afterward, the principal, Ms. Soto, who is Puerto Rican and bilingual, intercepted the man. "I need to ask you, Where is Ricardo's mom?" she said. "Because she needs to be notified."
The man insisted he had no idea, but the principal did not buy it: "I told D.C.F., 'This is very fishy -- it feels to me that he's hiding something.' And D.C.F. assured us that they had their technology specialists trying to find her."
What precise steps they took are unclear; child welfare cases are confidential. But generally speaking, the agency said, "when a child enters foster care, D.C.F. first tries to safely reunify the child with their biological parents by working collaboratively with immediate and extended family."
At significant cost to Olga and Ricardo, that initial effort failed.
From that point onward, the school took Ricardo under wing. "I felt, you know, in the absence of his mother, we have to try to replace that here in the building," Ms. Soto said.
In his English-immersion kindergarten, his teacher understood that he needed "an extra piece of care." While a quick learner, he would sometimes crumple. If he got frustrated writing his letters, he'd scribble over his work with an angry pencil. When he grew restless during individual work times, Ms. Cohn took him on walks, having planted ninja toys in the hallway that Ricardo could search for along the way.
"We spent a lot of time together, a lot of time just holding hands," she said, adding that she considered Ricardo "kind of magical," with a gift for making people "love him and go out of their way to take care of him."
At home, his foster parents focused on developing a routine.
Every morning, they woke him with a peppy playlist of Latin music and made light of wadding up his sheets when he wet his bed. He dressed himself, with flair, gravitating to dark jeans, dress shoes and a dab of cologne. Following his after-school program, Ricardo walked their dog and did some schoolwork. On weekends, there was family swim at the YMCA, followed by games on the Nintendo Switch with Mr. Herbold.
A month later, shortly before Christmas 2021, the child welfare department announced it was going to move him.
Ricardo's principal and foster parents worried about inflicting another disruption. But under federal law, states must consider "kinship care" for foster children, and Ricardo's father proposed his girlfriend's sister.
In legalese, she was "fictive kin." Yet fictive kin are supposed to have a relationship with a child, whereas Ricardo didn't know the woman.
"It really wasn't right," Ms. Soto said. "He was so OK with Christy and Nick."
****
In mid-January, Olga nervously paced the lobby of a Boston Holiday Inn, waiting for a social worker to arrive with her son. When they walked through the door, she fell to her knees and enveloped him in her arms.
Ricardo wriggled out of her embrace, shouting: "What took you so long? Why didn't you come find me sooner?"
Olga was at a loss to explain to her 5-year-old just how desperately hard she had tried, how nobody had notified her and how she had tracked him down through a network of relatives only after months of detective work. She showered him with presents and, when he softened, kisses. At their visit's end, she took his picture in the woolen hat with tasseled ear flaps she had brought him, capturing the sad eyes of a boy about to be separated from his mother again.
Civil rights groups have long accused the D.C.F. of mishandling immigrant families.
Hispanic children, who, like Black children, are more likely to be reported for neglect or abuse, are also more likely to be removed from their homes and more likely to be placed with strangers. They get moved around more and tend to stay longer in foster care.
But language barriers compound things. In a federal civil rights complaint, the Greater Boston Latino Network and other groups have accused the department of failing to provide adequate interpretation services, creating a risk of wrongful family separations.
Olga was appointed a free lawyer who did not speak Spanish. Because her English was still rudimentary, she decided to pay for one who did, and that cost her more than his $ 2,000 fee: The lawyer specialized in immigration, not family law. And it appears from the docket -- the record is impounded -- that he failed to make what could have been a crucial early plea.
In his place, lawyers consulted for this article said they would have immediately requested a temporary custody hearing and argued that Olga should be presumed fit absent any proof that she posed an imminent risk to her child. A simple background check could have been done and the judge could have questioned Olga. And then, in the best of circumstances, Olga could have walked out of the courtroom with her child.
But the child protection system was at that very moment embroiled in a cross-border custody scandal.
It involved a 5-year-old girl named Harmony Montgomery, a ward of the state whose father, a New Hampshire resident, had sought her custody. Abiding by its internal regulations, the Massachusetts D.C.F. asked New Hampshire to approve the move under a 62-year-old agreement called the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children. But the judge disagreed with this request, considering it an infringement on the father's right to parent his child, and did not wait for New Hampshire to respond.
The interstate compact was created primarily to govern cross-border foster care moves. Whether it applies to fit parents has been widely debated across the country, and high courts in at least a dozen states have said it does not.
The National Association of Counsel for Children agrees. "Applying the compact to parents who simply live out of state, when there is no finding or even allegation of wrongdoing, is unconstitutional and harmful to children,"" said Allison Green, its legal director.
But in late 2019, two years after the Massachusetts judge awarded custody to Harmony Montgomery's father, the authorities in New Hampshire revealed that the girl was missing and presumed to be dead.
Her shadow hung over Ricardo's case. Nobody in the Massachusetts child-welfare system wanted to take another potentially deadly risk involving the interstate compact.
And so not long after Olga returned to Hollywood, she was fingerprinted, drug-tested and visited by ChildNet, a private agency under contract to Florida. A caseworker found her home "very neatly kept and well maintained," with a nicely decorated children's bedroom. Yet in her report, in which she misidentified Olga as Guatemalan, the caseworker concluded that Ricardo would not be safe there.
"The mother is not a legal resident of the United States," she wrote. "She could be deported at any time."
This argument comes up frequently in cases where parents are detained by immigration authorities and fighting deportation. Yet Olga was not in deportation proceedings. She was simply one of the hundreds of thousands of unauthorized immigrants in Florida who, posing no threat to national security or public safety, are not an enforcement priority under Biden administration rules.
And she already had a child in her custody, Dariela, then 7, whom Florida had made no effort to remove on the same grounds.
Under the interstate compact, a receiving state's denial is technically binding. But legal experts said there could have been a quiet agreement among the parties to ignore a decision considered inappropriate.
****
Back in Massachusetts, the case froze, just as Ricardo's situation was growing newly turbulent. His father's girlfriend's sister wanted him out, and because no foster homes were available, the boy was likely to be placed in a group home and possibly in a different school district, too.
"That's when all hell broke loose," his principal said. "I was like: 'No, this cannot happen. This is the only place he knows as safe since he arrived here."'
In the end, she saw just one solution: She would take the boy into her own home even if it temporarily upended her life.
Every day, Ms. Soto had hundreds of children in her care. But, with her own children grown, it was something else to mother one -- to bathe, feed and discipline one. To be summoned over the loudspeaker to help him in the bathroom. To lie by his side until he was snoring softly because he couldn't fall asleep alone.
After weeks of observing video calls between Olga and Ricardo, Ms. Soto made it clear to caseworkers that she endorsed a speedy reunion. When spring break arrived with no progress, she asked Mr. Herbold and Ms. Sharr to take in the boy temporarily so she could visit family in San Juan. They leaped at the chance.
It was a tough visit. "He was mad, a mad kid who had been passed around," Ms. Sharr said. Still, their relationship deepened, and they, too, got to know and trust Olga. When Ricardo returned to the principal, they vowed to do whatever they could to help reunite mother and son -- a highly unusual commitment, child welfare experts said.
Their chance came quickly. By the end of the school year, Ricardo was starting to call his principal "Mamá." But she had summer commitments, and Ricardo was shuttled into a fourth family's care.
At that point, Ms. Sharr proposed that Olga move into their Cambridge home temporarily so the system could get to know her better. They would support her, they said. Arranging to leave her daughter with the girl's grandmother, Olga accepted. She was floored by their generosity. "There really are people who are angels," she said.
She was allotted twice-weekly visits with Ricardo at their house, at the end of which he would beg Olga to let him stay, as if she had a say, and promise to be a good boy, as if his behavior was the issue.
Before long, the child welfare department was proposing a fifth placement. This was not unusual in Massachusetts, which in 2021 ranked 48th among the states in "placement stability" for foster children, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation. (The agency says it has undertaken new initiatives to minimize moves.)
That was where Ricardo's advocates drew the line.
By that point, Olga had dismissed her private lawyer and accepted the original court-appointed one, with Ms. Sharr volunteering to serve as interpreter. The lawyer devised a strategy: Mr. Herbold and Ms. Sharr could become Ricardo's conditional guardians. They would have to surrender their foster care license and assume responsibility for the boy's health care, but they readily agreed.
In summer 2022, Ricardo joined his mother at their home, and Olga's new lawyer pushed immediately to schedule a trial to determine permanent custody. But with the government seemingly unable to find an open court date, Mr. Herbold and Ms. Sharr reached out to officials in Florida in hopes of catalyzing a resolution. If the state's main concern was taking on Ricardo as a ward should Olga be deported, they offered themselves -- "citizens of the United States by birth" -- as backup.
"To the State of Florida," Ms. Sharr wrote. "Nick and I are available for Ricardo should the need arise at any point in the future. We are able to care for Ricardo through his 18th birthday (and beyond). He is a part of our family now and we want the best for him, his mother, full biological sister and extended family in Florida."
****
In first grade, showing significant improvement behaviorally, academically and in English, Ricardo moved into a mainstream class. "He's wicked sharp," Mr. Herbold said. Purple paw prints, awards for class contributions, proliferated on the refrigerator. Spiderman took over elsewhere: Spider-Man pajamas, LEGOs, shampoo. Still, anxiety lurked beneath this cheery surface; a knock on the door would send him diving under a couch to hide.
Over winter break, with Dariela visiting, they all took a trip to New York City, where they rode a carriage through Central Park, sipping hot chocolate. They saw it, with fingers crossed, as a kind of farewell tour: Finally, six months after Olga's lawyer requested a trial date, one had been scheduled.
On Jan. 19, 2023, after a four-hour hearing, the judge found that Ricardo was "not in need of care and protection as to mother" and should be returned to Olga's custody.
Why he felt able to disregard the Florida denial at that point is unclear; juvenile judges in Massachusetts are not allowed to discuss their cases.
But before Olga had a chance to embrace her victory, the judge stayed his order for six days to give the child protection department time to appeal. And as she left the courtroom and returned to Florida to get her daughter back to school, Olga feared the worst.
Her advocates, however, chose optimism. On the eve of the department's decision, Mr. Herbold flew south with Ricardo. A few months later, under a new Florida law, Mr. Herbold would have been criminally liable for transporting an unauthorized immigrant into the state.
But at that moment, as they checked into a hotel, he was on tenterhooks for a different reason.
"OK, so now we go to Mom's, right?" Ricardo asked him.
"Oh, dude," Mr. Herbold replied. "You have to hang out with me for the night, because tomorrow the big boss is going to make a call as to whether you get to live with Mom or if you just get to see Mom and then we have to fly back to Boston."
The next day, more than a year after Olga first presented herself to the authorities in Massachusetts expecting an imminent reunion with her son, the custody decision became final.
Ten minutes after she got the news, Olga arrived at the hotel in buoyant spirits. She ran toward Ricardo and scooped him up in a fierce hug. As she stared into his eyes and he into hers, she staggered into the future with the boy in her arms, dangling but attached.

Gen Z Is on Facebook for the Marketplace: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For a generation that loves thrift-shopping, Facebook isn't a place to socialize online -- it's the best place to score some deals.
In December, Ellicia Chiu and Cher Su had just a few boxes in tow when they moved into a walk-up apartment in New York's Lower East Side neighborhood. Before their move, from Los Angeles, the two friends knew that they would need to furnish their new apartment with small kitchen appliances, décor and furniture. But instead of purchasing new items, they knew it would be more affordable to find secondhand items on Facebook Marketplace, the social network's buy-and-sell service.
"I only use Facebook for Marketplace," said Ms. Chiu, 24, who added that she spent most of her social time on TikTok and Instagram, which is owned by Meta, Facebook's parent company.
For many 20-somethings who don't have a lot of disposable income, Marketplace is a place to get deals on items they wouldn't normally be able to afford.
"As someone who's in their young 20s, I want to have nicer things but I don't have the financial means to get there yet," said Ms. Chiu, who added that she preferred Marketplace over other sites because its interface was easy to use, making it easier to find deals on furniture.
Over the past decade, Facebook has declined in popularity with Gen Z as a social site, a 2022 Pew Research Center survey found. Instead, younger people are spending more of their social time on Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat.
"Facebook Marketplace is often referred to as 'the internet's garage sale' and is a modern-day counterpart to eBay and Craigslist," said Yoo-Kyoung Seock, a professor of textiles, merchandising and interiors at the University of Georgia, who studies consumer behavior among Gen Z and millennials and environmental sustainability in the textile industry. "The platform's remarkable success is largely due to the trust users place in it, which is a result of its unique connection to Facebook's social network."
For a generation that is environmentally conscious and prefers to shop secondhand, Marketplace has become popular.
"Young people, including students and young professionals, are increasingly drawn to used goods," Dr. Seock said. Faster inflation has also made secondhand purchases a practical choice, she added.
Launched in 2016, Marketplace has over a billion monthly active users and is the second most popular online site for secondhand goods, behind eBay, according to a 2022 survey by Statista, a company that provides market data. Meta doesn't say much about Marketplace as a business, how its demographics may differ from Facebook overall and whether it has a vision to grow the platform in its annual reports. Meta did not respond to questions about whether it has long-term business goals for Marketplace or if it was aware of the platform's popularity among Gen Z.

Some buyers say they prefer Marketplace over Craigslist, which was popular among older generations searching for used goods, because unlike Craigslist users, Marketplace buyers and sellers have profiles with ratings that make them more trustworthy and messaging is built-in on Facebook, making communication easy.
Marketplace is free for buyers to use. Although sellers can encounter transaction fees, many of them avoid it by selling locally and asking buyers to bring cash when picking up their purchase. Ms. Chiu said she usually paid using Venmo, though she would bring cash if a seller insisted.
Ms. Chiu and Ms. Su said their favorite Marketplace purchase was a couch from West Elm, which the seller had for less than a year. The couch cost $ 1,200 at retail, and they purchased it for $ 145. Ms. Chiu said the seller had warned her that the couch had cat scratch marks, but when she and Ms. Su showed up to look at it, they didn't see many scuffs.
Some of their other favorite Marketplace finds include a Zojirushi rice cooker (retail price: $ 150; purchased on Marketplace for $ 50), a Dyson vacuum (retail price: $ 470; purchased on Marketplace for $ 135) and an IKEA NORDEN extendable table (retail price: $ 350; purchased on Marketplace for $ 150).
In total, Ms. Chiu and Ms. Su said they spent approximately $ 1,400 on more than 30 items purchased from Marketplace and estimated that they saved more than $ 3,000.
Not all of Ms. Chiu's and Ms. Su's purchases have been successes: Ms. Chiu once bought a plant from a seller that she discovered had root rot when she tried to repot it. Buyers have to work out returns with sellers on Marketplace, and Ms. Chiu's plant seller later offered her a refund of 50 percent of the price she had paid, which she accepted. Ms. Su said she once bought a bookshelf that fell apart once she was home. She was not able to get a refund.
Ms. Su said that she was aware of Marketplace scams and tried to avoid them. "There are many scammers that try to ask for personal information when messaging about items -- so beware of that too!" she warned. (Meta provides users with guides on recognizing and avoiding scams.)
Sebastian Ramos, a junior at DePaul University in Chicago, also uses Marketplace to buy and sell items, and he even once got a free couch (estimated retail price: $ 1,300). He has also purchased acrylic vinyl record shelves (estimated retail price: $ 45; purchased on Marketplace for $ 10) and sold his used Nintendo 3DS (retail price: $ 200; sold on Marketplace for $ 150).
Mr. Ramos, 21, said he did not use Facebook for social media, but he enjoyed purchasing secondhand items on Marketplace to save money and also because he liked shopping at thrift stores.
"You don't have to pay more for a new thing when you can find something that has been used, or even slightly used, for a lot cheaper," he said.
Sarah Williams, who lives in Kenosha, Wis., is an executive assistant and a new mom. Shortly after she and her husband found out that they were expecting a baby last year, Ms. Williams said Marketplace was the first place she started looking to buy baby items.
The first item on her list was a light-toned wooden crib. But the cribs that she found online were listed for $ 1,200 and were out of her budget.
"The prices were just absolutely ridiculous," Ms. Williams, 24, said.
After a rigorous two-week search online, she found a crib she liked that a woman who lived near her had listed on Marketplace. After messaging back and forth through Facebook Messenger with the seller, Ms. Williams and her husband drove to the woman's house to inspect the crib. They bought it for $ 300 -- 75 percent less than the original price -- after they saw that it was in good shape.
"It was a very nice exchange, and it felt very personable," Ms. Williams said.
Ms. Williams said she hoped to find other mothers on Marketplace who had items they no longer needed because their children had outgrown them.
Like Ms. Williams, Ms. Chiu and Ms. Su said that being able to network and meet new people when picking up their Marketplace purchases had been an enjoyable part of their moving experience and settling into their new home.
"That's what Facebook started as, and it's cool that Marketplace is also fostering that," Ms. Su said.

One Big Reason Gen Z Is Still on Facebook: To Save Money

NEW YORK — In December, Ellicia Chiu and Cher Su had just a few boxes in tow when they moved into a walk-up apartment in New York’s Lower East Side neighborhood.

Sarah Williams, who lives in Kenosha, Wisconsin, is an executive assistant and a new mom. Shortly after she and her husband found out that they were expecting a baby last year, Williams said Marketplace was the first place she started looking to buy baby items.
The first item on her list was a light-toned wooden crib. But the cribs that she found online were listed for $1,200 and were out of her budget.
“The prices were just absolutely ridiculous,” Williams, 24, said.
After a rigorous two-week search online, she found a crib she liked that a woman who lived near her had listed on Marketplace. After messaging back and forth through Facebook Messenger with the seller, Williams and her husband drove to the woman’s house to inspect the crib. They bought it for $300 — 75% less than the original price — after they saw that it was in good shape.
“It was a very nice exchange, and it felt very personable,” Williams said.
Williams said she hoped to find other mothers on Marketplace who had items they no longer needed because their children had outgrown them.
Like Williams, Chiu and Su said that being able to network and meet new people when picking up their Marketplace purchases had been an enjoyable part of their moving experience and settling into their new home.
“That’s what Facebook started as, and it’s cool that Marketplace is also fostering that,” Su said.

Full text: A remastered version of Star Wars: Dark Forces reminds gamers of a period in the 1990s when LucasArts could take risks with cherished intellectual property.
Though it sometimes feels as if there is a new "Star Wars" installment every couple of months, there was a time when all that fans of George Lucas's sci-fi universe had were three movies and a lot of imagination.
The 16-year gap between the end of that trilogy, 1983's "Return of the Jedi," and the start of the divisive prequels, 1999's "The Phantom Menace," was a vast creative void -- one that video games helped fill.
Developers at LucasArts, the subsidiary of Lucasfilm known for its adventure titles Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion, saw themselves as the standard-bearers of the "Star Wars" franchise for many years, said Jon Knoles, a longtime LucasArts designer. Unlike most games based on movies, its "Star Wars" games were not bogged down by market pressure or rushed to match a film's release.
"We had all kinds of creative freedom," said Knoles, who worked on more than a dozen "Star Wars" games in the 1990s and early 2000s, first as a background artist, then as a lead animator and finally as a writer and director.
The ability to take risks resulted in far more interesting games than other film adaptations, including Star Wars: Dark Forces, a first-person shooter released in 1995. On Wednesday, Nightdive Studios is releasing a remaster of Dark Forces that features enhanced lighting and textures but retains the look and feel of the original game. It is a testament to those LucasArts classics that are still beloved all these years later.
Super Star Wars (1992)
LucasArts had released rudimentary 8-bit action games based on "A New Hope" and "The Empire Strikes Back" for the original Nintendo Entertainment System, but it was not until Super Star Wars that its hot streak really got underway.
A side-scrolling platformer, Super Star Wars and its two sequels were inspired by the run-and-gun arcade game Contra. The goal, Knoles said, was to fill in the blanks of the original movie's story. "What really happened on the way to the Mos Eisley cantina?" he said. "Maybe Luke fell into a hole and had to shoot a bunch of womp rats." Womp rats were mentioned but not shown in "A New Hope," so Knoles had to make something up.
The frenetic Super Star Wars games were both exhilarating and difficult. "Those games were brutally hard. Just unforgiving," Knoles said. "It was a game that punched you in the face."
Star Wars: X-Wing (1993)
While LucasArts produced the Super Star Wars trilogy, it was also working on X-Wing, a state-of-the-art flight simulator that put players in the cockpit of a starfighter during the assault on the Death Star. Though the back and forth was stressful, Knoles said, the end result was considered a technological marvel.
"The first time that we had a TIE fighter flying toward the camera shooting laser bolts in fluid 3-D was a transformative moment for all of us," Knoles said. "We sat around the monitor, our jaws dropped and we knew that we were doing something incredible."
Star Wars: Rebel Assault (1993)
The same year saw the release of Rebel Assault, a rail shooter in the vein of Time Crisis and The House of the Dead, in which a camera moves around an environment and the player shoots enemies as they appear. Rebel Assault used cutting-edge tech like full-motion video and 3-D modeling to give it the impression of a movie come to life.
"We felt like we were pioneers," Knoles said of the game's advances. "We were doing these incredible visual effects -- or so we thought -- that were light-years ahead of what we had thought could be done in a video game."
Star Wars: Dark Forces (1995-96)
For Dark Forces, LucasArts branched out into an emerging genre, the first-person shooter, to tell the story of a mercenary working for the Rebel Alliance who discovers the Empire's nefarious plans in the lead-up to the events of "A New Hope."
Knoles said Dark Forces "followed in the footsteps" of influential games by id Software, putting "a 'Star Wars' twist" on titles like Wolfenstein and Doom. LucasArts expanded on id's work, making advances in controls and level design that were adopted across the industry. The success of Dark Forces led to the creation of two popular sequels, Jedi Knight and Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, that incorporated lightsabers.
Shadows of the Empire (1996)
When Nintendo asked LucasArts to design a "Star Wars" game for its new Nintendo 64 console, there was one stipulation: It had to be about a new character, not Luke Skywalker or Han Solo.
So Knoles pitched the idea of a game set between the events of "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi" that was based around "a carbon copy of Han Solo," the cocksure smuggler Dash Rendar. The game, Shadows of the Empire, was an ambitious 3-D action-adventure that in many ways felt like an adaptation of a movie that does not exist.
Knoles said the ambition was a problem. "It was a lesson in how not to design a game," he explained. "We took on too much." The game combined many elements from previous LucasArts games, including running and gunning, flying spaceships and platforming.
"The five or six games we did within that game, we should have done half of them," Knoles said. "Or if we really wanted to polish the hell out of it, we should have just done one thing, and done it really well."
Star Wars: Episode 1 Racer (1999-2000)
For the team's next game -- its first tied to the forthcoming "Star Wars" prequels -- it focused on one scene: the podracing sequence in "The Phantom Menace." Among some "Star Wars" fans, Episode 1 Racer, an electrifying sci-fi racing game, is remembered more fondly than the movie it is based on.
"We wanted to do just one thing: Go fast," said Knoles. He added that the mission was to make "'Ben Hur' at 600 miles per hour and three feet off the ground."
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter (2002)
With the prequel release cycle in full swing in the early 2000s, Knoles said that making "Star Wars" games had become "a lot more stressful and a lot less fun." His final title with LucasArts -- and in a lot of ways the last gasp for the era -- was the slick action game Bounty Hunter, based around the character of Jango Fett from the movie "Attack of the Clones."
The creation of Bounty Hunter, a complex game with deep combat and platforming, was not a pleasant experience for Knoles. "Man, that was tough -- the scale, the amount of people, the amount of stress," he said.
The most interesting part, for him, was working with Lucas, who offered creative guidance on the story.
"He said yes to almost everything I asked," Knoles said. "But when it came to motivation for the character, he said to keep it simple, and let it be all about the money."

Planet Of Doom Beckons: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The pleasant distractions of a beautiful open world undermine core narratives about pain and sacrifice on a doomed planet.
After you set off on your grand, world-spanning adventure in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the mystical flower girl, Aerith, sweeps her arms wide and marvels in her typically upbeat way at the natural beauty of the planet. "Just look at it all," she says, "It's so green! A living, breathing planet. ..."
Up to this point, Aerith, along with the game's other heroes -- Cloud, Barret and Tifa -- have been winding through cluttered slums, dark subway tunnels and soaring office megatowers in the dense, industrial city of Midgar. It's a claustrophobic experience that reinforces the sense of being trapped under the watchful eye of the previous game's main villain: the planet-destroying corporation Shinra.
Rebirth, on the other hand, is an open-world game in every sense of the term.
The second of three installments reinventing the beloved Final Fantasy VII, which was released in 1997, Rebirth is faithful to its part of the original story, at least in a geographical sense. After completing the events of Midgar -- where the previous game, 2020's Final Fantasy VII Remake, unfolded -- you head out into the wider world in search of Sephiroth, a product of Shinra who is now independently evil and somehow even more threatening to the planet's safety.
So though it makes sense that Aerith is stunned by the untrammeled natural bounty around her, it equally makes sense that Red XIII, the group's talking animal companion, responds: "It may look that way. But in reality, it's barely hanging on."
The game must constantly remind us that the planet is, indeed, dying. Aerith, though she clearly knows more than she lets on, is cast here as slightly naïve and shortsighted, reacting to what she sees on the surface even though the danger has never been greater. An existential threat looms just over the horizon.
Her problem, and ours, is that Square Enix, the studio behind the game, has built a world that really is beautiful, filled with pleasurable diversions.
Square Enix took the low-resolution prerendered dioramas of the original game -- gorgeous in their own right -- and zoomed in, stratifying them with detail and depth, adding craggy peaks, dense jungles and sun-baked deserts. There are villages packed with life; a Zen retreat atop a windswept rocky bluff; and a seaside resort town, complete with fashionable swimwear and Day-Glo scooters.
The studio also added mini-games, lots and lots of mini-games. Beyond the returning sky-casino -- the Golden Saucer, filled with hours of distractions -- there are card games and shooting challenges, soccer-likes and top-down strategy simulators. You can dive deep into timed combat challenges, or race the ostrichlike Chocobos on Mario Kart-inspired tracks.
It's the end of the world, sure. But this end of the world is as fun as any I have ever seen. Less apocalypse now than apocalypse later.
The contrast between the pleasure of playing the game and the dourness of its plot often ends up confusing things. Cloud, the game's spiky-haired hero, is slowly losing his mind, witnessing the steady degeneration of others like him, and even lashing out in a confused haze at his closest friends. Many other characters have stories steeped in melodramatic heartbreak and deep personal trauma. Death follows them.
But the game's light, toyetic presentation, its gorgeously lit, doll-like figures goofing around in hypercolor towns, beaches and casinos, undermines its core narratives about pain and sacrifice, about people tortured by their fates. We're barely allowed to sit with Barret's guilt for unintentionally causing his hometown's downfall when he invited Shinra to build a reactor there before we are whisked off to the frivolity of the Golden Saucer.
In Remake's downtrodden slums, it was impossible not to react to the harshness and brutality of the world. Characters struggled against something real and deeply grounded. They clashed swords with villains in business suits and mowed through jackbooted minions.
By opening up its world structurally, Rebirth also diffuses its own narrative. Its villains bear down on our heroes less. Although still ever-present, these villains serve more as lures and guideposts than threats.
When they appear, as Sephiroth often does, they glower and boast. But how can I feel threatened when there are card games to master, a Chocobo Cup to win? In many ways, Rebirth is closer to the kind of lighthearted, apolitical family games put out by Nintendo than the gritty steampunk vérité the original Final Fantasy VII sought to evoke.
Maybe all we want as an audience is a place to hang out with our favorite characters, suspended from any exigencies of time or plot. If we have to chase after Sephiroth's black-robed minions on their world tour, it helps that there are plenty of entertaining rest stops. It would certainly grate to spend the game's entirety in a driven, apocalyptic mode, like a Last of Us featuring J-pop stars.
In this theme park world, it's difficult not to see things through the same ecstatic lens as Aerith. But there also is plenty of reinforcement that all of this frolicking may come at a steep price.
A fishing village falls under the literal shadow of a Shinra military base and massive gun emplacement, its fish long gone, its fishermen struggling to make a living. Beneath the Golden Saucer there's a dust bowl, a result of the power plants installed to fuel its neon lights.
These moments of world building add to the already outrageous variety of Rebirth. Its topography and biome change drastically from chapter to chapter, bringing not only new vistas, but also new modes of exploration and unique gameplay mechanics. (The battle system is built on the same structure as Remake's while adding techniques like Synergies, which allow your party members to combine their attacks in different ways.)
I was shocked to discover, midway through the game, a foraging challenge that required carefully easing a mushroom from its root lest I break the head from the stalk and spoil the flavor. This activity appeared only once, for an inconsequential side mission, never to be seen again.
In spite of all this, or perhaps because of it, I found myself missing the simplicity and efficiency of the previous installment, and the original game too. As a teenager playing Final Fantasy VII in my bedroom, I was in awe of the visuals, of the way it depicted a planet in crisis. It was a message that stuck with me, and an important one, considering the real planet I was set to inherit.
I feel implicated, as a player, participating in Rebirth's fun-filled approach. It seems to recognize a certain truth: Much like in our own lives, there are far too many competing activities to focus on the end goal, no matter how important it may be.
I played more than 70 hours of Rebirth on natural-resource-depleting equipment, displaying the game on an energy-sucking screen while shut up in my climate-controlled home. But I didn't come away feeling grounded in any of this context. Instead, I remember winning a card tournament, clobbering baddies with finesse, collecting enough Chocobo feathers to finally purchase that rare saddle.
It's hard to imagine what the end of the world looks like, not until it's right at your door. Until then, might as well enjoy the games set before us. To do as Barret says upon stepping into the Golden Saucer: "Live it up while you can. Future's not promised to no one."
Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will be released for the PlayStation 5 on Feb. 29.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As the director of "Lisa Frankenstein," she embraced a tale in which no one was concerned whether grief was palatable to others.
Zelda Williams never intended a teenage zombie rom-com to be her feature filmmaking debut. For one thing, the project, "Lisa Frankenstein," was a big concept to sell, a high-camp period piece set in the fuchsia-and-teal '80s. There was grief, violence and a floofy-haired love interest who was -- not to put too fine a point on it -- not only mute but dead.
For another thing, Williams, 34, the only daughter of Robin Williams, the Oscar-winning comic superstar, worried that making her first big step out with a comedy would inevitably draw the wrong kind of attention. "It's the one thing I thought people are going to be particularly mean to me about," she said.
But the script for "Lisa Frankenstein" came courtesy of Diablo Cody, who found one-liners, and an Oscar, in adolescent trauma with "Juno," and who also wrote the feminist teen horror flick "Jennifer's Body," lately hailed as a cult classic.
Some of the themes in "Lisa Frankenstein" resonated with Williams's own life, as a person who experienced shock waves of anguish after her father's sudden death in 2014. Plus, the film came wrapped in a pastiche of references from '80s and '90s movies she loved, like "Heathers," "Weird Science," "Beetlejuice" and "Death Becomes Her." Williams was sold on it immediately, and of all the projects she was considering, it was the first to get greenlit.
So she tucked away her trepidation, drew up her storyboards and shot list, and showed up on location in New Orleans, where she promptly got Covid and had to spend the first week directing from inside a van.
That she still carried this all off impressed her cast and colleagues, who noted her ambition, preparation and resolve.
"I did not feel like a mentor of any kind," said Cody, 45, who's also a producer of the movie. "And in fact, I kind of felt like I was following her into this world."
Cody is so attuned to mood that she includes specific song cues in her screenplays, but Williams's ideas and eye for details, like giving the lead character a mane of curly, red hair -- for extra comic oomph -- surprised her. "There's so much of what she created that I had never even envisioned when I originally wrote the script," Cody said.
The reviews and box office returns for "Lisa Frankenstein," which stars Kathryn Newton ("Big Little Lies") as Lisa and the "Riverdale" heartthrob Cole Sprouse as her corpse buddy, have been middling, though critics bewitched by its gothy-teen-girl empowerment have reacted warmly. "Consistently laugh-out-loud hilarious," said The A.V. Club.
Sprouse, 31, who ran in similar young Hollywood circles as Williams and counts her as a friend, said they were aiming for the background nostalgia of a must-see sleepover movie. "We wanted it to give that kind of warm, fuzzy feeling," he said, "even though we're chopping people's hands off and stitching penises back on."
Over breakfast last month at a cafe in West Hollywood, Calif., Williams -- who wore a leather bomber jacket that had belonged to her father, and bused her own table -- reflected on her path to filmmaking. The movie is set in 1989, the year she was born. Its Easter eggs are all cinematic references, not memes. In a world that's "quite addicted to meta humor," she said, "to get to make something so purposefully earnest was so nice." Although she acknowledged that the film's brand of "earnest camp" would not be for everyone, she hoped at least "that the weirdos who need it, find it."
She grew up in San Francisco, the middle child of three; neither of her brothers are in the entertainment business. (Her mother, Marsha Garces Williams, is a philanthropist and producer.) Williams was a self-described nerdy kid, head of the high school tech committee, a dutiful student if not an academically inspired one. "I was up every night, writing," she said, "and that was my form of rebellion."
Visiting her dad's sets, she knew by 12 that she wanted to be involved in the industry. Her parents said she had to finish school first. "And even then, I don't think they really wanted me to be a part of it," she said. "But I think they started realizing they couldn't prevent it." At 17, she moved to Los Angeles, worked restaurant jobs and lived with roommates, quickly accruing small acting parts. After the pandemic, she surfaced as a director, with music videos and shorts to her name.
The script for "Lisa Frankenstein" came to her via a friend whom she was helping through a dark period. After she was publicly eloquent on the subject of her father's death by suicide (it later emerged that he had a form of dementia), people often reached out to her for support, she said. Her friend happened to be Cody's boyfriend, though he sent Williams the script without mentioning who wrote it.
Cody had had the germ of the idea, about a teenager and a corpse, for a while, and was spurred to complete it during the pandemic. "I just thought about how we live in a culture that wants so badly for us to move on from traumatic events," she said. "What if this young woman had an opportunity to literally embrace grief by loving this dead man?"
For Williams, the idea that audiences might see echoes of her experience mourning her father was tricky. "I think I won't ever be able to escape people assuming everything is about him, and I don't know if they would have had that same position if he was alive," she said.
But she understands. "You're in a fantasy world where death is not permanent," she said with a small smile. "Wouldn't that be nice?"
In practice and onscreen, though, a lot of that fell away, as the filmmakers addressed more visceral decisions: How gory should the movie be? Originally it spewed enough for a hard R rating; they edited it down to a PG-13. ("We did some really beautiful, creative painting out of the excess blood," Williams said.)
The '80s style, from the clothing to the sets, was a huge focus. The costume designer, Meagan McLaughlin Luster, used some of her own vintage pieces for Lisa's bouncy goth silhouette.
And the production design was its own horror show.
"There was a certain kind of woman in the '80s that really loved a seashell bathroom, a beach-themed powder room, and had this pastel nightmare phantasmagoria aesthetic in her home," Cody said. That was the vibe they were after for Janet, the aggressively aerobicized, intensely self-actualizing and demanding stepmother, played by Carla Gugino. "The first time I walked into that set, I was triggered," Cody said. "Like oh, the meanest mom I know lives here, and I'm 7. So that worked."
One of their biggest concerns was how to cast the dead guy, called the Creature. Cody was sure it would be an unknown because most actors want, at a minimum, dialogue. But Sprouse, who grew up on monster movies, jumped at the part, even studying mime to figure out the Creature's stiff but still endearing movements. "It's exciting to see how much emotion you can sort of bury into a character without lines," he said.
For Williams, making a movie in which no one worries whether grieving is palatable -- a movie in which the reaction to death is aggressively, comically unpalatable -- was cathartic. But, she said, "for me, at this point in my life, after this long, all work is cathartic."
"I actually look at anything that I'm enjoying as catharsis," she continued, "because I think a lot of life can be the space between things you're enjoying."
It was, she added, the "scariest thing I could have done, but glad that's out of my way now. Now I should just approach everything else I'm not afraid of, and see how that goes."

WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. — Zelda Williams never intended a teenage zombie rom-com to be her feature filmmaking debut. For one thing, the project, “Lisa Frankenstein,” was a big concept to sell, a high-camp period piece set in the fuchsia-and-teal ’80s. There was grief, violence and a floofy-haired love interest who was — not to put too fine a point on it — not only mute but dead.
For another thing, Williams, 34, the daughter of Robin Williams, the Oscar-winning comic superstar, worried that making her first big step out with a comedy would inevitably draw the wrong kind of attention. “It’s the one thing I thought people are going to be particularly mean to me about,” she said.
But the script for “Lisa Frankenstein” came courtesy of Diablo Cody, who found one-liners, and an Oscar, in adolescent trauma with “Juno,” and who wrote the feminist teen horror flick “Jennifer’s Body,” lately hailed as a cult classic.
Some of the themes in “Lisa Frankenstein” resonated with Williams’ own life, as a person who experienced shock waves of anguish after her father’s sudden death in 2014. The film also came wrapped in a pastiche of references from ’80s and ’90s movies she loved, like “Heathers,” “Weird Science,” “Beetlejuice” and “Death Becomes Her.” Williams was sold on it immediately, and of all the projects she was considering, it was the first to get greenlit.
So she tucked away her trepidation, drew up her storyboards and shot list, and in August 2022 showed up on location in New Orleans, where she promptly got COVID and had to spend the first week directing from inside a van.
That she still carried this all off impressed her cast and colleagues, who noted her ambition, preparation and resolve.
“I did not feel like a mentor of any kind,” said Cody, 45, who’s also a producer of the movie. “And in fact, I kind of felt like I was following her into this world.”
Cody is so attuned to mood that she includes specific song cues in her screenplays, but Williams’ ideas and eye for details, like giving the lead character a mane of curly, red hair — for extra comic oomph — surprised her. “There’s so much of what she created that I had never even envisioned when I originally wrote the script,” Cody said.
The reviews and box office returns for “Lisa Frankenstein,” which stars Kathryn Newton (“Big Little Lies”) as Lisa and “Riverdale” heartthrob Cole Sprouse as her corpse buddy, have been middling, although critics bewitched by its Gothy-teen-girl empowerment have reacted warmly. “Consistently laugh-out-loud hilarious,” said The A.V. Club.
Sprouse, 31, who ran in young Hollywood circles similar to Williams’ and counts her as a friend, said they were aiming for the background nostalgia of a must-see sleepover movie. “We wanted it to give that kind of warm, fuzzy feeling,” he said, “even though we’re chopping people’s hands off and stitching penises back on.”
Over breakfast last month at a cafe in West Hollywood, Williams — who wore a leather bomber jacket that had belonged to her father, and bused her own table — reflected on her path to filmmaking. The movie is set in 1989, the year she was born. Its Easter eggs are all cinematic references, not memes. In a world that’s “quite addicted to meta humor,” she said, “to get to make something so purposefully earnest was so nice.” Although she acknowledged that the film’s brand of “earnest camp” would not be for everyone, she hoped at least “that the weirdos who need it, find it.”
She grew up in San Francisco, the middle child of three; neither of her brothers is in the entertainment business. (Her mother, Marsha Garces Williams, is a philanthropist and producer.) Williams was a self-described nerdy kid, head of the high school tech committee, a dutiful student if not an academically inspired one. “I was up every night, writing,” she said, “and that was my form of rebellion.”
Visiting her dad’s sets, she knew by 12 that she wanted to be involved in the industry. Her parents said she had to finish school first. “And even then, I don’t think they really wanted me to be a part of it,” she said. “But I think they started realizing they couldn’t prevent it.” At 17, she moved to Los Angeles, worked restaurant jobs and lived with roommates, quickly accruing small acting parts. After the pandemic, she surfaced as a director, with music videos and shorts to her name.
The script for “Lisa Frankenstein” came to her via a friend whom she was helping through a dark period. After she was publicly eloquent on the subject of her father’s death by suicide (it later emerged that he had a form of dementia), people often contacted her for support, she said. Her friend happened to be Cody’s boyfriend, although he sent Williams the script without mentioning who wrote it.
Cody had had the germ of the idea, about a teenager and a corpse, for a while, and was spurred to complete it during the pandemic. “I just thought about how we live in a culture that wants so badly for us to move on from traumatic events,” she said. “What if this young woman had an opportunity to literally embrace grief by loving this dead man?”
For Williams, the idea that audiences might see echoes of her experience mourning her father was tricky. “I think I won’t ever be able to escape people assuming everything is about him, and I don’t know if they would have had that same position if he was alive,” she said.
But she understands. “You’re in a fantasy world where death is not permanent,” she said with a small smile. “Wouldn’t that be nice?”
In practice and on-screen, though, a lot of that fell away, as the filmmakers addressed more visceral decisions: How gory should the movie be? Originally it spewed enough for an R rating; they edited it down to a PG-13. (“We did some really beautiful, creative painting out of the excess blood,” Williams said.)
The ’80s style, from the clothing to the sets, was a huge focus. Costume designer Meagan McLaughlin Luster used some of her own vintage pieces for Lisa’s bouncy Goth silhouette.
And the production design was its own horror show.
“There was a certain kind of woman in the ’80s that really loved a seashell bathroom, a beach-themed powder room, and had this pastel nightmare phantasmagoria aesthetic in her home,” Cody said. That was the vibe they were after for Janet, the aggressively aerobicized, intensely self-actualizing and demanding stepmother, played by Carla Gugino. “The first time I walked into that set, I was triggered,” Cody said. “Like, ‘Oh, the meanest mom I know lives here, and I’m 7.’ So that worked.”
One of their biggest concerns was how to cast the dead guy, called the Creature. Cody was sure it would be an unknown because most actors want, at a minimum, dialogue. But Sprouse, who grew up on monster movies, jumped at the part, even studying mime to figure out the Creature’s stiff but endearing movements. “It’s exciting to see how much emotion you can sort of bury into a character without lines,” he said.
For Williams, making a movie in which no one worries whether grieving is palatable — a movie in which the reaction to death is aggressively, comically unpalatable — was cathartic. But, she said, “for me, at this point in my life, after this long, all work is cathartic.”
She continued, “I actually look at anything that I’m enjoying as catharsis, because I think a lot of life can be the space between things you’re enjoying.”
It was, she added, the “scariest thing I could have done, but glad that’s out of my way now. Now I should just approach everything else I’m not afraid of, and see how that goes.”

Survey Shows 17 Percent of Gamers Identify as L.G.B.T.Q.: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In its first survey of the video game industry, the advocacy group GLAAD determined that few console games include queer characters.
Less than 2 percent of console video games include L.G.B.T.Q. characters or story lines even though 17 percent of gamers are queer, according to GLAAD's first survey on the industry.
The survey, whose results were released on Tuesday, said a majority of respondents had experienced some form of harassment when playing online. But it also found that many queer gamers saw virtual worlds as an escape in states where recent legislation has targeted L.G.B.T.Q. people. Seventy-five percent of queer respondents from those states said they could express themselves in games in a way they did not feel comfortable doing in reality.
"That is a statistic that should pull on everyone's heartstrings," said Blair Durkee, who led the advocacy group's survey alongside partners from Nielsen, the data and marketing firm. "The statistic is driven largely by young gamers. Gaming is a lifeline for them."
GLAAD has produced a similar breakdown of queer representation in television since 1996. Its latest report found that 10.6 percent of series regulars in prime-time scripted shows identified as L.G.B.T.Q., which researchers said helped put their video game study in perspective.
Tristan Marra, GLAAD's head of research and reports, said that there were nearly 1,500 participants in the video game survey and that researchers used public information to meticulously search for inclusive content in games that are available on the PlayStation, Xbox and Switch digital libraries.
"I am deep into gaming and still have a hard time naming" L.G.B.T.Q. characters, said Raffy Regulus, a founder of NYC Gaymers, which hosts game nights in the city. Regulus pointed to Ellie from The Last of Us and Venture from Overwatch 2 as some recent examples.
GLAAD said it reached out to major companies, including Sony and Nintendo, for its survey but did not receive a response.
"It helped validate what we know about the critically important role that gaming plays," Marra said. "We wanted to talk about the moral case and the business case."
The report cites data indicating that global revenue for gaming surpasses that of film and music combined, with younger generations spending nearly as much time playing games as watching television. It also indicates that many queer players want to see themselves represented in games.
"The findings of this report send a powerful message to the industry: It is time to move past the idea that L.G.B.T.Q.-inclusive games are a separate, niche category," Durkee said. "All games should strive to reflect the people who play them."
In recent years, GLAAD has consulted on efforts to improve queer representation in games like The Sims 4 and Tell Me Why, which the organization said included the first playable transgender character in a major studio game.
Some players have observed gradual improvements in the diversity of the gaming industry, though they say it can feel like progress happens at a snail's pace.
"I would like to see the gaming industry hire more gay people and give them the tools in order to better reflect our lived experiences," Regulus said.

Losing a Son, and Their Bridge to a Foreign World: [National Desk]

Full text: Linda Zhang wandered into her son's room and sat for a while. She visits there from time to time, after her husband has gone to work at the restaurant and their other kids have gone to school.
The Ferrari logo sheets were still on her son's bed. The Nintendo video game controllers were in his closet. Decorative cutouts of an elephant and a butterfly were on the wall.
And then there were the many tributes, gifts and drawings that poured in after her son, Peter Wang, was shot multiple times and killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. On this morning, Ms. Zhang pointed out a framed letter.
"Maybe the governor of Florida?" she said, peering at a page signed by Senator Marco Rubio. There was also a portrait of Peter, which Ms. Zhang said might have been drawn by a famous artist, but she wasn't quite sure.
"My English isn't good," she explained in Mandarin Chinese. "Peter was always my translator."
Six years after 17 families lost loved ones in the Parkland, Fla., massacre, Ms. Zhang and her husband, Kong Feng Wang, are navigating the wilderness of grief in unusual isolation. Other Parkland parents spoke out about school safety and gun control, ran for school board seats, spearheaded lawsuits and set up foundations to honor their slain children. At group events, many found solace and a safe space to vent their frustrations.
Peter's parents, who do not speak English fluently, struggled to keep up with those conversations, or to take the kind of action that might have given them an outlet for their grief. In court, a place of catharsis for some families, they relied on translators to speak for them and to give them a bare understanding of the proceedings.
"All I want is to be able to do something for Peter," Mr. Wang said. "But how can we? We don't speak the language. We don't know the culture."
Well-meaning friends and relatives have urged the couple to move on and focus on raising their two younger sons, Jason and Alex. But Ms. Zhang and Mr. Wang are not sure what moving on means. They have shrugged off suggestions from others that they see a therapist, a practice still widely stigmatized in Chinese culture.
Short on connections and comforts, Mr. Wang has largely disappeared into his work and Ms. Zhang into her grief.
"You can see that they have so many things to express to the world but they can't," said Lin Chen, a cousin of Peter who has served as a translator in court for Mr. Wang and Ms. Zhang and works as a trauma psychotherapist. "There's been a lot of accumulation of these negative emotions, and when that becomes so big, it can crush a person even more."
The American dream
In August 2022, Ms. Zhang took the witness stand, choking back sobs as Ms. Chen read a statement in English on her behalf.
"My name is Linda," Ms. Chen said, as her aunt sat trembling beside her in the courtroom. "I am Peter Wang's mom. It is so difficult to write this letter because I don't know how to use language to express the pain of losing my oldest son, Peter."
A few months before, prosecutors notified the victims' families that they had the option of reading an impact statement at the sentencing trial of Nikolas Cruz, the gunman. Ms. Zhang had initially been unsure whether she would accept. Even in Chinese, talking openly about grief felt so unnatural. And what could such a statement really accomplish?
But at the urging of her niece, Ms. Chen, and some of the other victims' parents, Ms. Zhang agreed to prepare some words. It felt right to honor Peter's memory in this way. Lying in bed one morning, Ms. Zhang told Ms. Chen, who sat beside her taking notes, what she wanted to say:
Peter was the perfect son. Everyone always told me how lucky I was to have him. Our house is now so quiet over the holidays.
Using her aunt's thoughts as guidance, Ms. Chen translated and drafted the statement in English that she later read in court.
There was so much more that Ms. Zhang wanted the world to know about Peter, so much more she could have said in her own language. But for now, these words -- words she could not even understand -- would have to do.
For Ms. Zhang and Mr. Wang, the English language had long been an obstacle.
Born in rural Fujian, a coastal province in southern China, Mr. Wang grew up speaking Mandarin and a local Fujianese dialect. He did not know any English, but at age 21, he decided to move to the United States to look for work anyway.
Like many young Fujianese seeking better opportunities, he paid a smuggler to take him to South America. Then, from Suriname, he and other young Chinese men made a treacherous journey by boat and foot across Central America. Three months after he left Fujian, he crossed the border into the United States. It was 1996.
"We were so young," said Mr. Wang, 47. "We didn't know what it meant to be afraid."
Mr. Wang quickly found work in the back of a Chinese restaurant in Cleveland. He stayed in the job for several years, living in a workers' dormitory and earning about $ 800 a month, most of which he used to pay off the $ 40,000 debt he owed to his smuggler.
In Cleveland, he met Ms. Zhang, who also worked at the restaurant and had come to the United States by a similar route. Both Ms. Zhang, 44, and Mr. Wang said they understood that learning English would broaden their lives, and had tried several times to study it. But they eventually gave up.
"It just never really sank in," Ms. Zhang said.
In 2002, the couple married and briefly moved to New York City, a hub for Fujianese immigrants in the United States, to have their first baby. Ms. Zhang (traditionally, Chinese women keep their names) gave birth to a healthy, eight-pound baby boy in Brooklyn. They gave him the Chinese name Mengjie. "Meng" was a family name. "Jie" meant "hero."
For an English name, they chose Peter.
"I heard the name on television and thought it sounded nice," Ms. Zhang said. "And it was easy to pronounce."
Around 2005, Mr. Wang and Ms. Zhang moved to Miami after hearing from a friend about an opportunity to open their own takeout Chinese restaurant. There, Peter witnessed his family's struggles firsthand, she said. He saw his father robbed at gunpoint in the restaurant and his mother mugged by a stranger.
Peter developed a sense of responsibility from a young age, Mr. Wang and Ms. Zhang said. Like many children of immigrants, he was his parents' bridge to the English-speaking world, translating correspondence from school and interpreting at doctor's appointments.
Peter often played the roles of caretaker and translator for his extended family, too. During a family trip to Disney World, Peter insisted on holding the toddler daughter of a family friend in his arms for 20 minutes so she could see the fireworks. When his cousin Aaron moved to Florida from China, Peter took him under his wing at school and helped him communicate with the other students.
The two cousins became best friends, bonding over their shared love for Power Rangers, dinosaurs and video games and their shared disdain for Saturday Chinese school and after-school tutoring. In 2012, they spent a summer together in China. Aaron had been feeling anxious -- it was his first time back in China after moving to the United States. But seeing Peter immediately put him at ease.
"As soon as I opened the door, Peter jumped out with a new toy and was like, 'Let's play,"' recalled Aaron Chen, 22, now a student at the University of Florida. "All of a sudden it was like we were right back in the States. He made me feel very secure."
In 2015, Mr. Wang and Ms. Zhang opened a Japanese buffet restaurant in Pompano Beach, Fla., with Ms. Zhang's siblings. Eventually, they saved up enough money to move from Miami to Coral Springs, and then to a gated community in Parkland, an affluent, predominantly white suburb that had some of the best public schools in the area.
Ms. Zhang and Mr. Wang became U.S. citizens. They embraced some American traditions, like installing Christmas lights on their house.
But they lived in a Chinese-speaking world that seemed parallel to the one their neighbors inhabited. Mr. Wang and Ms. Zhang often hosted parties for their Chinese friends and family in their spacious home, raucous affairs with platters of fried noodles and seafood from the restaurant and the cousins racing around.
"Our house was the place to be," Ms. Zhang recalled.
'What could we do?'
Feb. 14, 2018, was Valentine's Day and the night before Chinese New Year's Eve. Peter and his friends were planning to come by that evening to celebrate, so Mr. Wang was at the restaurant, Miyako Japanese Buffet, preparing.
Then he heard about a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Soon he was in a hotel lobby with Ms. Zhang, surrounded by police and school officials, waiting alongside many other worried parents.
That's where they learned that Peter was among the 14 students and three staff members killed.
The days and weeks afterward were a numbing march of grieving rituals. Family and friends helped plan a funeral. Buddhist priests helped to pick out a grave according to feng shui principles.
Peter was buried in Bailey Memorial Cemetery in North Lauderdale, Fla., in his Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps uniform. Later, West Point posthumously admitted Peter for taking heroic action by holding a classroom door open so that his classmates could escape from the rampaging gunman.
Many families, including some of Peter's relatives, found ways to channel their grief to salvage something from their irretrievable loss.
Several of Peter's cousins participated in the March for Our Lives, which became a national student-led movement for gun control. In the beginning, Ms. Zhang and Mr. Wang were active, too. They traveled with the other victims' families to Tallahassee, where they met with lawmakers and participated in a march for stricter gun control measures.
But the talk all felt like muffled noise, and their efforts seemed futile. They had grown up in a country where citizens had little sway over the government's policies. And like many immigrants, they saw the American political system as impenetrable. The couple began to withdraw.
"What could we do?" Mr. Wang said. "The law is for politicians. We are just ordinary people."
They felt somewhat less isolated when they attended gatherings with the relatives of the other Parkland victims. Ms. Zhang said she could feel their pain viscerally.
"There's a bond there of sudden loss," said Tony Montalto, who lost his daughter, Gina, in the shooting. "We would try to talk as best we could."
With Mr. Montalto's help, Ms. Zhang and Mr. Wang tried to set up a foundation. But without someone who could speak English and handle the day-to-day administrative tasks, the foundation has been mostly dormant. And because of the language barrier, Ms. Zhang and Mr. Wang gradually lost touch with most of the other parents.
"If I could speak English, I would do so much, I would go to every memorial, every gathering of parents," Ms. Zhang said in a recent interview.
Family divide
In Chinese culture, the loss of a child is seen not only as a great calamity for a family, but as a potential sign of more misfortune to come. Out of superstition as well as grief, some choose to steer away from the tragedy rather than confront it head-on.
Not long after the shooting, Mr. Wang's mother -- Peter's grandmother -- went around the house and took down photos of Peter, including a family portrait that had been taken a few months before. Distraught, Ms. Zhang rushed to the photo studio where they had taken the portrait and was relieved to find it was still on file.
Today, the photo hangs on the wall in the couple's bedroom. But in the stairway, some collage frames that once displayed photos of Peter remain empty.
Determined to preserve Peter's memory, Ms. Zhang turned to a canvas that she alone could control. She has five tattoos honoring him. Most of them were inked on Valentine's Day -- the date of his death. One on her shoulder shows his initials over a broken heart framed by angel wings. Another, on her chest, has Peter's name and a heart and a butterfly next to the English words "You always live in my heart."
In some ways, Ms. Zhang has heeded the advice of family members urging her not to dwell on her grief. Last year was the first since Peter's death that Ms. Zhang did not get a tattoo.
But in other ways, she is still trapped in the miasma of despair. The family's home, once the locus of so many festive occasions, has gone quiet. While Mr. Wang and Ms. Zhang leave a traditional red envelope containing money on Peter's bed every Chinese New Year, they now struggle to summon the energy to celebrate the holiday.
And in the rare instances when the family talks about Peter's death, the couple often refers to it as the shiqing, or the "event."
Mr. Wang said he had tried to suppress his grief with a return to familiar habits. He puts in long shifts at the family restaurant, and many days he drops off his middle son, Jason, 17, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, where he is a senior.
He said he had thought about moving his family to China, where mass gun violence is almost nonexistent. But he and his family had already committed to building their lives in America.
"I just wish things were a little safer for our kids, that's all," he said.
Ms. Zhang still has moments of levity and joy, whether it's cackling with friends at a crude joke or cradling her nephew's newborn son.
But life in America eventually became all but unbearable. Last year, Ms. Zhang moved with her youngest son, Alex, 11, back to Fujian, seeking comfort in a place that was familiar yet free of the constant reminders of Peter's death. She struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder, hypertension and insomnia, among other ailments. She would like to stay in China, where she can talk to doctors without a translator, until her health improves.
Last fall, while Ms. Zhang was in Florida for a brief visit, she and Mr. Wang went to Peter's grave. It was his 21st birthday. He should have been having his first legal drink and celebrating with a big cake, maybe with a girlfriend, Ms. Zhang thought.
Instead, Ms. Zhang and Mr. Wang were kneeling on the damp grass next to his grave. They carefully pulled out the weathered miniature American flags and replaced them with new ones. When they had finished sprucing up the plot, Ms. Zhang, Mr. Wang, Jason and several other relatives stood quietly around Peter's grave for about half an hour.
As everyone left, Ms. Zhang and Mr. Wang lingered. A colorful "Happy Birthday!" balloon bobbed around in the misty air. Mr. Wang tapped the grave marker twice with the tip of his umbrella.
"Goodbye, Peter," he said. "We'll see you again soon."
That afternoon, the family gathered for a feast of barbecued lamb skewers, crab legs and freshly shucked oysters. Ms. Zhang glanced at the light rain still falling outside, unusual for November in Florida. It was a sign from Peter, she thought.
She and Mr. Wang knew that loneliness would engulf them again when the day was over. But for now, they were grateful to be with people who understood.

PARKLAND, Fla. — Linda Zhang wandered into her son’s room and sat for a while. She visits there from time to time, after her husband has gone to work at the restaurant and their other kids have gone to school.
The Ferrari logo sheets were still on her son’s bed. The Nintendo video game controllers were in his closet. Decorative cutouts of an elephant and a butterfly were on the wall.
And then there were the many tributes, gifts and drawings that poured in after her son, Peter Wang, was shot multiple times and killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. On this morning, Zhang pointed out a framed letter.
“Maybe the governor of Florida?” she said, peering at a page signed by Sen. Marco Rubio. There was also a portrait of Peter, which Zhang said might have been drawn by a famous artist, but she wasn’t quite sure.
“My English isn’t good,” she explained in Mandarin Chinese. “Peter was always my translator.”
Six years after 17 families lost loved ones in the Parkland, Florida, massacre, Zhang and her husband, Kong Feng Wang, are navigating the wilderness of grief in unusual isolation. Other Parkland parents spoke out about school safety and gun control, ran for school board seats, spearheaded lawsuits and set up foundations to honor their slain children. At group events, many found solace and a safe space to vent their frustrations.
Peter’s parents, who do not speak English fluently, struggled to keep up with those conversations, or to take the kind of action that might have given them an outlet for their grief. In court, a place of catharsis for some families, they relied on translators to speak for them and to give them a bare understanding of the proceedings.
“All I want is to be able to do something for Peter,” Wang said. “But how can we? We don’t speak the language. We don’t know the culture.”
Well-meaning friends and relatives have urged the couple to move on and focus on raising their two younger sons, Jason and Alex. But Zhang and Wang are not sure what moving on means. They have shrugged off suggestions from others that they see a therapist, a practice stigmatized in Chinese culture.
Wang has largely disappeared into his work and Zhang into her grief.
“You can see that they have so many things to express to the world but they can’t,” said Lin Chen, a cousin of Peter who has served as a translator in court for Wang and Zhang and works as a trauma psychotherapist. “There’s been a lot of accumulation of these negative emotions, and when that becomes so big, it can crush a person even more.”
The American Dream
In August 2022, Zhang took the witness stand, choking back sobs as Chen read a statement in English on her behalf.
“My name is Linda,” Chen said, as her aunt sat trembling beside her in the courtroom. “I am Peter Wang’s mom. It is so difficult to write this letter because I don’t know how to use language to express the pain of losing my oldest son, Peter.”
A few months before, prosecutors notified the victims’ families that they had the option of reading an impact statement at the sentencing trial of Nikolas Cruz, the gunman. Zhang had initially been unsure whether she would accept. Even in Chinese, talking openly about grief felt so unnatural.
But at the urging of her Chen and some of the other victims’ parents, Zhang agreed to prepare some words. Lying in bed one morning, Zhang told Chen, who sat beside her taking notes, what she wanted to say:
Peter was the perfect son. Everyone always told me how lucky I was to have him. Our house is now so quiet over the holidays.
Born in rural Fujian, a coastal province in southern China, Wang grew up speaking Mandarin and a local Fujianese dialect. He did not know any English, but at age 21, he decided to move to the United States to look for work anyway.
Like many young Fujianese seeking better opportunities, he paid a smuggler to take him to South America. Then, from Suriname, he and other young Chinese men made a treacherous journey by boat and foot across Central America. Three months after he left Fujian, he crossed into the United States. It was 1996.
“We were so young,” said Wang, now 47. “We didn’t know what it meant to be afraid.”
Wang quickly found work in the back of a Chinese restaurant in Cleveland. He stayed in the job for several years.
In Cleveland, he met Zhang, who also worked at the restaurant and had come to the United States by a similar route. Both Zhang, now 44, and Wang said they understood that learning English would broaden their lives, and had tried several times to study it. But they eventually gave up.
“It just never really sank in,” Zhang said.
In 2015, Wang and Zhang opened a Japanese buffet restaurant in Pompano Beach, Florida, with Zhang’s siblings. Eventually, they saved up enough money to move from Miami to Coral Springs, and then to a gated community in Parkland.
Zhang and Wang became U.S. citizens. They embraced some American traditions, such as installing Christmas lights on their house.
But they lived in a Chinese-speaking world that seemed parallel to the one their neighbors inhabited. Wang and Zhang often hosted parties for their Chinese friends and family in their spacious home.
“Our house was the place to be,” Zhang recalled.
Family Divide
In Chinese culture, the loss of a child is seen not only as a great calamity for a family, but as a potential sign of more misfortune to come. Out of superstition as well as grief, some choose to steer away from the tragedy rather than confront it head-on.
Not long after the shooting, Wang’s mother went around the house and took down photos of Peter.
Wang said he had tried to suppress his grief with a return to familiar habits. He puts in long shifts at the family restaurant, and many days he drops off his middle son, Jason, 17, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, where he is a senior.
He said he had thought about moving his family to China, where mass gun violence is almost nonexistent. But he and his family had already committed to building their lives in America.
They felt somewhat less isolated when they attended gatherings with the relatives of the other Parkland victims. But because of the language barrier, Zhang and Wang gradually lost touch with most of the other parents.
Zhang still has moments of levity and joy. But life in America eventually became all but unbearable.
Last year, Zhang moved with her youngest son, Alex, 11, back to Fujian, seeking comfort in a place that was familiar yet free of the reminders of Peter’s death.
Last fall, while Zhang was in Florida for a brief visit, she and Wang went to Peter’s grave. It was his 21st birthday. He should have been having his first legal drink and celebrating with a big cake, maybe with a girlfriend, Zhang thought.
Instead, Zhang and Wang were kneeling on the damp grass next to his grave. When they had finished sprucing up the plot, Zhang, Wang, Jason and several other relatives stood quietly around Peter’s grave for about a half-hour.
As everyone left, Zhang and Wang lingered. Wang tapped the grave marker.
“Goodbye, Peter,” he said. “We’ll see you again soon.”
That afternoon, the family gathered for a feast of barbecued lamb, crab legs and fresh oysters. Zhang glanced at the light rain still falling outside, unusual for November in Florida. It was a sign from Peter, she thought.
She and Wang knew that loneliness would engulf them again when the day was over. But for now, they were grateful to be with people who understood.

You Are So Dead When Mom Finally Finds Out: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A little too enamored of its own references, this teen horror-comedy feels a bit misshapen but still delivers some light fun.
Ever since Mary Shelley wrote "Frankenstein" at age 19, it has functioned as a remarkably versatile Rorschach test, prescient in ways its author could hardly have anticipated. Usually it's interpreted as a story about hubris, about man playing God and reaping the consequences. But you can just as easily read it as a lucid explication of Rousseau's ideas about human nature, or as a slippery narrative told by a not-quite-reliable narrator who's trying to get away with murder.
On the other hand, Guillermo del Toro, one of our greatest contemporary horror directors, has described "Frankenstein" as "the quintessential teenage book," full of angst and curiosity about becoming an adult. And though he wasn't talking about "Lisa Frankenstein" specifically, he might as well have been. Shelley's novel lends itself well to teen horror-comedy, and the screenwriter Diablo Cody -- who wrote "Juno" and "Jennifer's Body," as well as the book for the youth-focused "Jagged Little Pill" Broadway show -- seized on that angle. The result is a very, very loose adaptation of "Frankenstein" that doesn't draw on much from the original. Directed by Zelda Williams in her feature debut, this is instead the familiar story of a loner finding love in an unlikely place.
Perhaps you spent the late 1980s and early '90s doing something other than being a school-age girl. So it's worth noting that the title of the film is a nod to a company, named for its founder, that produced brightly colored stickers with characters like unicorns and kittens and bears that eventually made their way to the broader school supply set. (In grade school circa 1992, my friends and I yearned for Lisa Frank Trapper Keepers, the true marker of cool.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
I was a little bummed out to discover that, despite the title, the nostalgic brand never really shows up in the movie -- in fact, the vibe isn't Lisa Frank-esque at all. But it's OK, because "Lisa Frankenstein" is girly-gothy, in a way that's a lot of fun once you get used to it. In fact, the best thing about the film is its production design, which takes familiar trappings from movies of the era (I thought of everything from "Poltergeist" to "Edward Scissorhands" to "Pretty in Pink" to "Weird Science," itself a loose "Frankenstein" adaptation) and just dials up the color temperature a few degrees. It's a pastiche crossed with a tribute, complete with references to slasher films, Cinderella, loner high school flicks and a makeover montage. Plus, of course, "Frankenstein."
The movie itself leaves a little more to be desired. The plot is fairly predictable, albeit in a way that feels distinctly of its era -- a bit of a disappointment from a writer who has in the past played more boldly with expectations around teen girls. Lisa (Kathryn Newton) lives with her father (Joe Chrest), her stepmother (Carla Gugino) and her cheerleader stepsister (Liza Soberano) in the suburbs. She misses her dead mother desperately, but is trying to get on with life at her new school, where she's even spotted a cute guy to crush on. Yet her true love, a 19th-century dead guy, is in the graveyard, where she hangs out to make grave rubbings and daydream.
You can kind of see where this is going: The 19th-century dead guy is not going to stay that way. One night, he rises (played, in suitably ghastly makeup, by Cole Sprouse), and they fall in love. Lisa has never met such a gentlemanly boy -- the fact that he doesn't really talk doesn't hurt -- and she starts, at last, to feel understood.
Cody gets a little subversive with it all -- Lisa's stepsister, Taffy, for instance, is not at all what this kind of movie usually serves up, and that feels refreshing. But the rest is pretty predictable from the start, and so it starts to wear a little thin after a while, a title in search of a story. Even with all of the John Hughes DNA here, the characters are more one-dimensional. Williams's directorial timing lags, undercutting the wit that Newton and Soberano bring to their characters. And I'm not sure if I'm supposed to feel sympathy for Lisa and her love interest, but the mishmash of references starts to get in the way.
Yet it's not that "Lisa Frankenstein" has nothing to recommend it. Brief, pleasant and fun to look at, the movie is not interested in anything more than love and being understood, and in that way it's a great callback to teen romances from an earlier era. If we could drag Mary Shelley out of her own graveyard, she just might be amused by this.

Harnessing Nostalgia For the Old Internet: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Author: Argüello, Diego

Full text: Developers have created nostalgic experiences recalling online life before homogenized websites and algorithmic social media feeds.
Surfing the web in the 1990s and early 2000s was a slower endeavor, and fewer people had access to the technology. But it is still easy to reminisce about the days when it felt like a public marketplace, with a good chance that someone out there had made a blog or GeoCities site about the niche topic you found interesting.
Those robust online forums have since been flattened into algorithmic social media feeds or hidden on messaging apps, a shift mourned by several video games with a shared fondness for bygone internet eras.
Games like last year's Videoverse, 2019's Hypnospace Outlaw and the upcoming Darkweb Streamer use chat interfaces akin to AIM or MSN, as well as fake websites that greet people with MIDI songs and text written in bold fonts. Each experience has its own nostalgic lens but is a snapshot of lost expression, creativity and independence.
Chantal Ryan, an anthropologist and the lead developer of Darkweb Streamer, a horror simulation game that merges the perils of modern streaming with the '90s internet, bemoaned how high-quality independent services were often cannibalized by corporate interests. She pointed to sites like Goodreads and AbeBooks, both bought by Amazon.
"It reminds me of forest clearing," said Ryan, who studied at the University of Adelaide. "You have this habitat with sustainable ecosystems, and communities of beings living harmoniously. And then the bulldozer comes in and destroys literally everything in its path with no regard to who's being affected."
Ryan has spent considerable time researching past online habitats for Darkweb Streamer, which is influenced by archives of GeoCities as well as spiritual successors such as Neocities. She also drew from her own experiences as a popular player in the early Halo 2 esports scene.
Being in the spotlight exposed Ryan to the ugliness of the internet. As her social media following grew, her most mundane movements, like sharing a photo, were "tracked and watched constantly" by others, Ryan said, echoing the online experiences of many high-profile figures.
Some users would make copycat accounts pretending to be her in Halo 2, as well as in forums and Myspace. Experiences like this led the developer to leave social media for years. But it was difficult to stay away forever.
"A couple of friends I knew who were in the industry were like, 'If you're going to make a game, you have to be on Twitter,"' Ryan said.
The developer Lucy Blundell did similar research for the visual novel Videoverse, which follows the final days of the online social network for a fictional gaming system in 2003. She was dedicated to replicating how people once chatted online, such as including a nose when typing out a smiley face. One of her key resources was Archiverse, which preserves approximately 17 terabytes of user-made content from Nintendo's discontinued Miiverse.
Not everything, however, is easily accessible. Jay Tholen, a developer for the small studio Tendershoot, said he was having difficulties finding source material for Dreamsettler, the follow-up to Hypnospace Outlaw, a web simulation game set in 1999. Flash-based content, aside from sites like Newgrounds and preservation archives such as Flashpoint, is harder to access.
"Many forums are dead, and many were excluded from the Wayback Machine," he said. "Websites got more dynamic. If you click a link and it requires a script or a login, you can't access it. You can go to the front page of the forum and maybe see some thread titles."
In Hypnospace Outlaw, finding information requires additional effort as well. Acting as enforcers, players are tasked with flagging malicious pages containing activities like internet bullying or copyright infringement.
Players occasionally receive tips via an in-game mail service, leading to a hyperlink or message board that kick-starts an investigation. In the 1990s, search engines were not as functional as they are now. Instead, users relied on webrings and tags to find results related to topics of interest.
The sites are all fictitious, most of them mere showcases of satire and old online absurdity. They also provide a throwback to an era where pages had free-form stylization, without external advertisements muddling the navigation experience.
Blundell said the modern internet produced more stress and negativity than the internet of the past, when monetization models were still in their infancy. Now simply finding a recipe online can be taxing.
"There are cookie pop-ups for almost every single page you access," Blundell said. "You've got multiple adverts, little videos down the page, it's a bit of a nightmare."
These newer games are following in the path of titles like Emily Is Away, Secret Little Haven and Digital: A Love Story, which also serve as internet time capsules.
Emily Is Away has the player explore a relationship between two high school students through an app resembling AOL Instant Messenger. The story of Secret Little Haven is told via the perspective of a transgender teenage girl, exploring themes such as gender and community as she navigates an invented operating system.
Both Videoverse and Hypnospace Outlaw take cues from these ideas, expanding them with more complex presentations. Darkweb Streamer will ask players to engage with a livestreaming interface, pursuing the goal of gaining hundreds of subscribers. As you gain notoriety, A.I.-programmed viewers might send you a mysterious package or show up at your apartment.
In order to promote their games, independent developers can feel tied to an ecosystem that is always on: Disengaging after office hours or during weekends could result in a missed job lead or award nomination opportunity. The developers of Videoverse, Hypnospace Outlaw and Darkweb Streamer also expressed discontent over how even the simplest tasks have become needlessly convoluted.
The increasing use of the instant messaging app Discord as a replacement for forums is bad for the accessibility of information, Tholen said. Joining a server can be confusing to the uninitiated, and Discord has not put any preservation efforts in place.
People who stumble onto the Discord server for Hypnospace Outlaw, Tholen said, are often "looking for hypnosis sex stuff" in real life. As a joke, they are welcomed by a user-made GIF that features the character Professor Helper, a parody of Microsoft's vintage Clippy. "I think one or two of those people stuck around and bought the game," Tholen said.
Other alternatives to X, like Mastodon and Bluesky, seem to retread old paths in a muddled internet era where community and self-expression are growing scarce.
"The history of the internet is that time is short and all spaces change," Ryan said. "A question I've been engaging with a lot as an anthropologist is: What does the disintegration of a community and the diaspora look like online? But also, as someone who runs a studio or a business, where am I supposed to go?"

A.I. Was Asked to Create the Joker. It Generated a Copyrighted Image.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Reid Southen, a movie concept artist based in Michigan, tried an A.I. image generator for the first time, he was intrigued by its power to transform simple text prompts into images.
But after he learned how A.I. systems were trained on other people's artwork, his curiosity gave way to more unsettling thoughts: Were the tools exploiting artists and violating copyright in the process?
Inspired by tests he saw circulating online, he asked Midjourney, an A.I. image generator, to create an image of Joaquin Phoenix from "The Joker." In seconds, the system made an image nearly identical to a frame from the 2019 film.
Gary Marcus, a professor emeritus at New York University and artificial intelligence expert who runs the newsletter "Marcus on A.I.," collaborated with Mr. Southen to run even more prompts. Mr. Marcus suggested removing specific copyrighted references. "Videogame hedgehog" returned Sonic, Sega's wisecracking protagonist. "Animated toys" created a tableau featuring Woody, Buzz and other characters from Pixar's "Toy Story." When Mr. Southen and Mr. Marcus tried "popular movie screencap," out popped Iron Man, the Marvel character, in a familiar pose.
"What they're doing is clear evidence of exploitation and using I.P. that they don't have licenses to," said Mr. Southen, referring to A.I. companies' use of intellectual property.
The tests -- which were replicated by other artists, reporters at The New York Times, and published in Mr. Marcus's newsletter -- raise questions about the training data used to create every A.I. system and whether the companies are violating copyright laws.
Several lawsuits, from actors like Sarah Silverman and authors like John Grisham, have put that question before the courts. (The Times has sued OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, and Microsoft, a major backer of the company, for infringing its copyright on news content.)
A.I. companies have responded that using copyrighted material is protected under "fair use," a part of copyright law that allows material to be used in certain cases. They also said that reproducing copyrighted material too closely is a bug, often called "memorization," that they are trying to fix. Memorization can happen when the training data is overwhelmed with many similar or identical images, A.I. experts said. But the problem is found also with material that appears only rarely in the training data, like emails.
For example, when Mr. Southen and Mr. Marcus asked Midjourney for a "Dune movie screencap" from the "Dune movie trailer," there may be limited options for the model to draw from. The result was a frame nearly indistinguishable from one in the movie's trailer.
A spokeswoman for OpenAI pointed to a blog post in which the company argued that training on publicly accessible data was "fair use" and that it provided several ways for creators and artists to opt out of its training process.
Midjourney did not respond to requests for comment. The company edited its terms of service in December, adding that users cannot use the service to "violate the intellectual property rights of others, including copyright." Microsoft declined to comment.
Warner Bros., which owns copyrights to several films tested by Mr. Southen and Mr. Marcus, declined to comment.
"Nobody knows how this is going to come out, and anyone who tells you 'It's definitely fair use' is wrong," said Keith Kupferschmid, president and chief executive of the Copyright Alliance, an industry group that represents copyright holders. "This is a new frontier."
A.I. companies could violate copyright in two ways, Mr. Kupferschmid said: They could train on copyrighted material that they have not licensed, or they could reproduce copyrighted material when users enter a prompt.
The experiments by Mr. Southen, Mr. Marcus and others exposed instances of both. The two published their findings in the magazine by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers last month.
A.I. companies said they had established guardrails that could prevent their systems from producing material that violates copyright. But Mr. Marcus said that despite those strategies, copyrighted material still slips through.
When Times journalists asked ChatGPT to create an image of SpongeBob SquarePants, a children's animated television character, it produced an image remarkably similar to the cartoon. The chatbot said the image only resembled the copyrighted work. The differences were subtle -- the character's tie was yellow instead of red, and it had eyebrows instead of eyelashes.
When Times journalists omitted SpongeBob's name from another request, OpenAI created a character that was even closer to the copyrighted work.
Prof. Kathryn Conrad, who teaches English at the University of Kansas, started her own tests because she was concerned that A.I. systems could replace and devalue artists by training off their intellectual property.
In her experiments, ultimately published with Mr. Marcus, she asked Microsoft Bing for an "Italian video game character" without mentioning Mario, the famed character owned by Nintendo. The image generator from Microsoft created artwork that closely resembled the copyrighted work. Microsoft's tool uses a version of DALL-E, the image generator created by OpenAI.
Since that experiment was published in December, the image generator has produced different results. An identical prompt, input in January by Times reporters, resulted in images that strayed more significantly from the copyrighted material, suggesting to Professor Conrad that the company may be tightening its guardrails.
"This is a Band-Aid on a bleeding wound," Professor Conrad said of the safeguards put in place by OpenAI and others. "This isn't going to be fixed easily just with a guardrail."

Full text: When Nikki Haley decided that her future husband, Bill, looked more like a Michael, a Michael he became. How unusual are name-change proclamations in the world of love?
Back when Nikki Haley, the last woman standing in the race for the Republican nomination, began dating her now-husband, she took a look at him and asked him what his name was.
Puzzled, he told her it was Bill, which she already knew.
"You just don't look like a Bill. What's your whole name?" she replied, to which he answered, "William Michael."
"From that point on, I started calling him Michael, and all my friends did the same," she wrote in her 2012 memoir, "Can't Is Not an Option."
"Before we knew it, he was universally known as Michael," she continued. "Everyone who knew him before I did knows him as Bill, and everyone who met him after I did knows him as Michael. He looks like a Michael."
Mr. Haley even went by that name in a South Carolina newspaper's bridal registry announcement in 1996 ahead of the couple's wedding. He still continues to go by Michael.
That got me thinking: What happens when you can't see yourself dating someone with a particular name? Or if you simply don't like your partner's name? If Mr. Right said his name was Chad, would that be a deal-breaker? If the woman of your dreams had the same name as your mother, would you stop the pursuit or call her by another one?
The idea of "looking" more like one name than another could stem from specific memories and characteristics that people have associated with certain names: Meet enough Bills, and you're bound to form ideas of what a Bill looks like. A strong reaction to a person's name -- and certainly one visceral enough to want to call a partner by a different name -- usually comes from somewhere, said Carol Bruess, a professor emeritus at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota and a relationship social scientist.
"When a name evokes an emotional reaction, it's usually because of a past or current relationship with someone who had that or a similar name," she added.
According to Dr. Bruess, when we have had a traumatic or negative relationship with someone, those negative associations can be easily transferred to anyone with the same name.
"If you begin dating someone with the same name as your emotionally abusive uncle, it might take time to reorient your emotional connection to the name," she said. "Like any symbol, we can recreate and reassign the meaning."
One Reddit user even sought the help of strangers to learn to love his girlfriend's name, Zelda. Her parents were apparently "huge literary geeks," and her mother had an interest in the life of Zelda Fitzgerald.
"I love her. I just can't get over her name," he wrote in a post. "I call her pet names and weird nicknames all the time, because I just feel so weird calling her Zelda. It reminds me of Legend of Zelda, and I don't like the games, and my first thought is always 'who names their kid after a video game?"'
Another user admitted not only to disliking her partner's name, Bradley, but confessed that she instead calls him babe "90 percent of the time."
Opting to be known by a middle name isn't exactly uncharted territory for Ms. Haley, the former governor of South Carolina. Although her given name is Nimarata, she goes by Nikki, which she has said is on her birth certificate. (Former President Donald J. Trump has made an issue of Ms. Haley's name on the campaign, repeatedly flubbing her given name as a racist dog whistle.)
It's normal for couples and families to refer to one another by nicknames or totally different names as a way to show affection, to reflect a close bond, or to pay homage to an elder or an ancestor.
In Ms. Haley's case, she changed her husband's name as she was still getting to know him and -- at least in her recounting -- did not seem to ask for his permission.
Names are at the center of people's identity, according to the linguist Laurel Sutton, the president of the American Name Society. People change their names for a number of reasons, including a gender transition, a hard-to-spell name or a simple distaste for the one they were given. But usually, it's their choice.
"To tell someone to change their name because of your personal preferences, that's a big ask," she said.

Tech Layoffs Enter a New Phase: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Amazon, Google, Microsoft and other tech companies have been on a layoff spree this month, with the latest cuts differing from last year's mass reductions.
Last year, Mark Zuckerberg declared 2023 to be a "year of efficiency." His company, Meta, soon laid off a third of its employees. Amazon, Google and Microsoft also cut tens of thousands of workers.
Their worlds did not stop. Not only that, the companies were rewarded. Their stock prices soared. Some divisions were more productive. And the companies -- including X, formerly known as Twitter, which has chopped nearly 80 percent of its staff since late 2022 -- continued operating.
Other chief executives took notice. And a month into 2024, tech companies have entered a new phase of cost cutting.
After last year's widespread layoffs, the largest firms -- including Amazon, Google and Microsoft -- have in recent weeks made smaller, targeted job trims while focusing on fewer projects and shifting resources to key products such as artificial intelligence. Some tech start-ups -- such as Flexport, Bolt and Brex -- have slashed more deeply to stave off potential extinction. The mandate from the top is the same: Do more with less.
"There are three basic buckets of layoffs we're seeing," said Nabeel Hyatt, a general partner at the venture capital firm Spark Capital, which invests in tech companies. "Big, fat tech oligopolies looking for more growth and profit; there are the medium-size companies that over-hired during boom times; and there are the smaller start-ups that are just trying to gain runway to survive."
The new layoffs are the latest correction to years of a booming global economy and near-zero interest rates, which gave tech companies the ability to throw off gobs of cash to attract top talent in the pandemic. Many of the companies hired tens of thousands of new workers during that time to keep up with digital demand.
The past couple of years have forced tech executives to think differently. After lockdowns lifted and people ventured back out into the world, use of tech products shrank compared with pandemic highs. More than 1,000 tech companies eliminated upward of 260,000 jobs in 2023, according to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, which catalogs job cuts across the tech industry.
Slashing tech work forces would have been anathema in Silicon Valley just a few years ago. Tech culture has long been one in which a manager's status was determined by how many people reported to him or her and how effectively a company countered competitors' recruitment efforts. Tech executives often viewed attracting the next generation of computer scientists as a full-contact sport.
But now the stigma of layoffs has dissipated. More executives at tech companies have admitted that they over-hired in the pandemic. The largest companies are making strategic cuts to areas where they plan to invest less and where certain types of jobs are no longer needed. Smaller companies that could easily raise capital just a few years ago are cutting to stay afloat.
In the first 30 days of this year, 25,000 layoffs occurred across roughly 100 tech companies, according to Layoffs.fyi. Microsoft, Google, Apple, Meta and Amazon are set to give more insight into the state of the industry when they publish quarterly financial statements this week.
Waves of job losses tend to happen suddenly and all at once, said Sheel Mohnot, a partner at the venture capital firm Better Tomorrow Ventures. "When one company in your space or nearby does it, it gives you air cover to do it," he said. "It becomes easier for a company to say, 'It's not us -- it's the industry."'
Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, exemplifies the arc of layoffs.
Last year, Mr. Zuckerberg cut what he called "managers managing managers." This year, the company has been more targeted with its trims, specifically narrowing the number of "technical program manager" roles across Instagram, according to two people familiar with the company's plans. A technical program manager, or T.P.M., oversees different projects inside a department and is responsible for keeping teams on schedule -- exactly the kind of middle-manager role Mr. Zuckerberg was intent on cutting.
Business Insider earlier reported on Meta's move to shrink the role. Meta declined to comment.
Amazon also shed hundreds of jobs this month at its streaming arm, including at Prime Video, MGM Studios and Twitch. Google made thousands of cuts across several areas, including YouTube and the hardware division that makes the Pixel phone, Fitbit watches and Nest thermostat. In an internal memo obtained by The New York Times, Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, hinted that there was no imminent end to the rolling layoffs, and that the company would remove more "layers to simplify execution and drive velocity in some areas" of the business.
"Many of these changes are already announced, though to be upfront, some teams will continue to make specific resource allocation decisions throughout the year where needed, and some roles may be impacted," Mr. Pichai wrote.
Medium-size start-ups with hundreds of employees are scaling back as well. Some face the prospect of an initial public offering, which has caused them to take a hard look at their finances. Such companies "know they need to get their balance sheets together," Mr. Mohnot said. "The market values profits."
Certain areas have been hit particularly hard this month, notably the video game industry. Companies including Unity Software, Riot Games, Eidos-Montréal, and Microsoft's Activision Blizzard and Xbox have downsized in recent weeks.
Those cuts are due partly to a consolidation of game studios, said Joost van Dreunen, an analyst who watches the sector. After a number of blockbuster game debuts last year, a relatively muted slate of titles is expected this year, with fewer workers needed to release those games, he said. Consumers and coders are also waiting for new consoles like Nintendo's Switch 2, which leads to a more immediate pullback in customer spending and development of new titles.
Discord, the social networking and group chat app popular with gamers, this month cut 17 percent of its staff, or 170 jobs, after increasing its head count fivefold since 2020.
"We took on more projects and became less efficient in how we operated," Jason Citron, Discord's chief executive, wrote in a memo to employees.
Few expect the wave of consolidation to slow anytime soon. Those in the tech industry now joke about ZIRP companies -- short for Zero Interest Rate Phenomenon, describing start-ups that would not have been able to obtain capital if not for access to cheap and free-flowing venture dollars.
Many of those start-ups, unable to attract further venture investment as interest rates rose, are cutting staff and focusing on fewer products.
"They might have just tried a bunch of things to find a business model that works," Mr. Mohnot said. "But now, it's reckoning time."

Microsoft Joins Peers by Cutting 1,900 Jobs From Activision Blizzard and Xbox: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The reductions come three months after the tech giant completed its $ 69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
Microsoft said Thursday that it would eliminate 1,900 roles in its video game division, including at Activision Blizzard, which it acquired for $ 69 billion three months ago.
The job cuts will be made at Activision Blizzard, the maker of hit games like Call of Duty and Guitar Hero, as well as Xbox, according to a staff memo from Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft Gaming, that was obtained by The New York Times.
The cuts amount to a reduction of nearly 9 percent of Microsoft's 22,000-person video game division, but less than 1 percent of the company's roughly 220,000 employees overall.
"Looking ahead, we'll continue to invest in areas that will grow our business and support our strategy of bringing more games to more players around the world," Mr. Spencer said in the memo.
This month, thousands of employees across the video game industry have been told they are facing layoffs, as the pandemic boom in playing continues to recede.
Riot Games, which makes League of Legends, said it would lay off about 11 percent of its work force. Twitch, a video streaming platform owned by Amazon that is used heavily by gamers, announced that it would cut 35 percent of its staff. Discord, a social platform beloved by gamers, is cutting 18 percent of its ranks. And Unity Software, which provides software for game developers, said it was cutting a quarter of its staff, or roughly 1,800 jobs. They all had layoffs last year as well.
Piers Harding-Rolls, a gaming researcher at the analytics firm Ampere Analysis, said some trims at Activision Blizzard were expected after the acquisition, but the extent of the industry cuts was "unprecedented."
"I've been really surprised by the scale and extent in terms of the number of companies that have laid people off in the new year," he said. "It seems like a lot of companies waited for the end of the year and pulled the trigger in January."
At Microsoft, gaming has become the company's most important consumer business, surpassing $ 15 billion in annual sales, largely under the Xbox brand. The company's ambitions became clear two years ago, when it announced the blockbuster deal to acquire Activision, whose valuation had fallen over concerns about its workplace culture, which the company denied.
The deal faced intense regulatory scrutiny around the world, and the company had to delay the closing date to October, from last summer. In the meantime, as the world reopened after the pandemic retreated, consumers started going out again instead of staying in and playing. Microsoft's gaming revenue fell $ 764 million, or 5 percent, in its last fiscal year, which ended June 30.
Bobby Kotick, who led Activision Blizzard since 2008 and built it into a powerhouse, left the company at the end of last year. The president of Blizzard Entertainment, Mike Ybarra, announced on the social media platform X that Thursday would be his last day at the company.
"Having already spent 20+ years at Microsoft and with the acquisition of Activision Blizzard behind us, it's time for me to (once again) become Blizzard's biggest fan from the outside," Mr. Ybarra wrote.
The layoffs were reported earlier by The Verge. Microsoft declined to comment.
The video game industry is "suffering through a winter right now," said Joost van Dreunen, a New York University professor who studies the gaming business.
This year is expected to be slower for the industry than 2023, which had a series of blockbuster releases like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and a remake of Resident Evil 4.
In the meantime, companies are shedding workers and cutting costs to stay competitive. "If everybody around you is cutting their overhead and you don't, you're going to invoke the wrath of your shareholders at some point," Mr. van Dreunen said.

Full text: The survival game started as a meme and became a miracle for its developers, who have insisted they are not copying the popular Nintendo series.
A video game once ridiculed for putting machine guns into the hands of cute creatures, eerily similar to the ones in Pokémon, was downloaded by an enormous audience over the weekend.
More than 300,000 players simultaneously logged on to the game, Palworld, when it was released in early access on Friday, momentarily causing servers to crash and eject users from its cruel world of chickens and squirrels engaged in shootouts.
By Sunday evening, Palworld had became one of the most popular games on the planet. It has sold more than five million copies on the Steam marketplace and is one of the most played games ever on the platform, with concurrent users reaching 1.5 million. The title remained atop the Steam top sellers list on Monday afternoon, ranked above major releases like Call of Duty and Baldur's Gate 3, and is also available on Xbox consoles through the Game Pass subscription service.
It was an undeniable success for Pocketpair, the Tokyo studio behind the game. The company has weathered memes and mockery for the past three years after its initial trailer for Palworld drew comparisons to an apocalyptic version of Pokémon. On a page advertising the game, Pocketpair was compelled to write explicitly, "It is not a scam."
That trailer featured players harvesting crops and raising sheep in a fantasy setting before abruptly transitioning to a gunfight where a lamb is being used as a living shield. Other scenes included virtual animals slaving away in a weapons factory, which an early description on Steam described as "essential for automation" where the creatures would "work forever as long as they're fed until the end of their lifetime."
The version of Palworld that was released this past weekend modified the factory gameplay, focusing instead on more than a hundred creatures that players could tame in the wilderness.
Takuro Mizobe, chief executive of Pocketpair, has resisted comparisons to Nintendo's hit franchise. "It could be a lucky thing to have the meme of Pokémon with guns, but we totally didn't intend it," he said during an interview with The Gamer in 2021.
Mizobe and the game's lead developers said then that Palworld was more akin to a survival game, with influences from Minecraft, Dragon Quest and Grand Theft Auto.
He recently told the publication Automaton that his game had completed a legal review. "We make our games very seriously," he said in a statement, "and we have absolutely no intention of infringing upon the intellectual property of other companies."
A spokeswoman for the Pokémon Company declined to comment. Pocketpair did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Players are still drawing the comparisons online, uploading videos to YouTube and Twitch under titles like "Pokémon with guns."
Ryan Broderick, the journalist behind Garbage Day, a newsletter about digital culture, said his time with the game had been entertaining if superficial. Palworld satisfies a craving for Pokémon fans like him, who desire new content that experiments with the traditional formula of catching monsters and battling trainers. But he does not see Palworld as a credible replacement for the long-running series.
"As a cultural curiosity, I don't think there is anything wrong about checking it out. But don't expect anything good," Broderick said. "This company made the game in the laziest way possible."

Wary Fans Need Winning Over: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: There was a divisive trailer for Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, the franchise's first game in 14 years. But the developers behind Rayman Legends are confident in their approach.
There had been more than a decade of anticipation for Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown when its debut trailer was unveiled last year. Fans hoped the first major installment in the video game series since 2010's Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands would be another lavish 3-D adventure, with state-of-the-art graphics and boundary-pushing sword-and-sandals action.
Mounir Radi, the director of The Lost Crown, had carefully chosen a propulsive, high-energy rap song written and recorded for the trailer by Joznez, 2WEI and Kataem. It was perhaps an odd choice for a high-fantasy swashbuckler set in ancient Persia. But Radi, who works for the French game developer Ubisoft Montpellier, felt it struck the right note of startling energy.
"I wanted to come in, bam bam, with a big surprise," he said.
What was surprising was how intensely people hated it. Reactions to the trailer ranged from disappointed to hostile. Those expecting a game in the mold of the acclaimed Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, from 2003, were unhappy that The Lost Crown would be a side-scroller. Others complained that the protagonist, Sargon, was a new character rather than the familiar Prince.
More than anything, people hated the song. It seemed to embody the central problem: The game didn't feel like Prince of Persia.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
But that bold vision was an intentional choice.
Work on The Lost Crown, which releases on Thursday for the PC and all major consoles, began in 2019, when the producer Abdelhak Elguess got the idea to create a new Prince of Persia in the style of Ubisoft Montpellier's most famous franchise: the side-scrolling platformer Rayman.
The 2.5-D format -- in which character models and backgrounds appear three-dimensional but the action takes place on a 2-D horizontal plane -- was popularized by Nintendo titles like New Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, and has been featured in many modern platformers, including Ubisoft Montpellier's own Rayman Legends.
Elguess said 2.5-D was a very early decision for The Lost Crown, noting that the format, which adds a sense of depth, is more conducive to "deep platforming and very strong combat and strategy." (The style is also reminiscent of the original Prince of Persia, which was released for the Apple II computer in 1989.)
Radi said his team was prepared for some resistance, knowing that players craved a 3-D game. But it was important to the studio to move forward.
"We wanted to respect our vision and our ambition," he said. "We are Ubisoft Montpellier. We are able to surprise players. We have a lot of trust. And we have a specific expertise."
That manifests in the game's ultraprecise platforming and deep combat, as well as the complex level design and intricate, multilayered structure. The acrobatic movement is brisk and kinetic. The story, about the kidnapping of the Persian prince and the rescue efforts of his elite team of bodyguards, led by the ambitious Sargon, involves a surprising amount of character development and psychological nuance given the genre.
Radi said he wanted The Lost Crown to be a Metroidvania -- a style that relies on backtracking and exploration, as in the recent games Guacamelee! and Hollow Knight -- because "it is the perfect genre to respect the player's cleverness." The team also introduced an original feature that has been widely praised for enhancing the Metroidvania experience: the ability to take in-game screenshots that can be pinned to map locations for later reference.
Although not as large in scope as some of the previous entries in the series, The Lost Crown is beautifully realized, rich in lore and full of interesting details drawn from Persian mythology, including boss battles with the legendary manticore and the mystical creature Azhdaha. Most importantly, it feels very much like Prince of Persia.
Critics have been coming to the same conclusion. Phil Hornshaw, writing for IGN, said The Lost Crown "finally nails what I loved about those classic Prince of Persia games," using the Metroidvania framework in a way that "calls back to the roots of the 1989 original." Steve Watts, in a review for GameSpot, said that its "impactful combat, silky platforming and innovative exploration mechanics" make Prince of Persia "a leader in its class once again."
Radi always expected that people would eventually come around.
"We knew that when they played the game they would have a change of heart," he said. "When you pick up the controller, it's instant love."
To be on the safe side, Ubisoft Montpellier has put out a free demo of The Lost Crown.
"That's kind of new for us," Radi said, laughing. "But this is the kind of game that you need to play to understand what we were trying to achieve."

Teenage Boy 'Beats' Tetris, Joining A.I. At the Top: [National Desk]

Full text: Willis Gibson, a competitive Tetris player prodigy from Oklahoma, advanced so far in the original Nintendo version of the game that it froze. "I can't feel my fingers," he said afterward.
On Dec. 21, Willis Gibson, 13, put his hands to his head and rocked back and forth in an office chair in his bedroom in Stillwater, Okla., unable to believe what he had just accomplished.
His screen had frozen, and his Tetris score read "999999."
"Oh my god," Willis repeats in a high pitch, in video of his triumph that he uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday, as he collapses into his chair. "I can't feel my fingers."
Willis had just become the first person to advance so far in the original Nintendo version of the puzzle game Tetris that the game froze, achieving a feat previously credited only to artificial intelligence.
Invented by the software engineer Alexey Pajitnov and released on the original Nintendo Entertainment System in 1989, Tetris features relentless arrays of shapes floating down a player's screen. The object of the game is to keep the blocks from piling up. Players can rotate the blocks and position them to form solid lines, at which point those rows are cleared away. It is among the most enduring and celebrated video games ever.
Theoretically, the game can go on forever if a player is good enough. For years, though, the limit was thought to be Level 29, when the blocks start falling so quickly that it seems as if it would be impossible for a human to keep up. But in the last decade, a new generation of Tetris players has tested those boundaries.
Willis got to Level 157, reaching Tetris's "kill screen," the point where a video game becomes unplayable because of limitations in its coding. (In the video, when the game freezes, the screen reads that Willis had made it to Level 18. That's because the code wasn't designed to advance so high.)
Willis, who has played Tetris competitively since 2021 under the name Blue Scuti, said in an interview on Tuesday that he was "just extremely excited." His Tetris journey started when he came across YouTube videos of the game, and he began gathering the equipment necessary to play an old version of it.
He said he was attracted to the game because of its "simplicity."
"It's easy to start off yet it's really hard to master it," he said in the interview. (Even record-breakers have to do their chores; Willis had just finished emptying the dishwasher when he took a call from a New York Times reporter, said his mother, Karin Cox, 39.)
Ms. Cox bought her son a version of a Nintendo console called a RetroN, which used the same hardware as the original Nintendo console, from a pawnshop, as well as an old cathode-ray tube television to help him get started. In a given week, Willis said, he plays about 20 hours of Tetris.
"I'm actually OK with it," Ms. Cox, a high school math teacher, said. "He does other things outside of playing Tetris, so it really wasn't that terribly difficult to say OK. It was harder to find an old CRT TV than it was to say, 'Yeah, we can do this for a little bit."'
For decades, gamers "beat" Tetris by hacking into the game's software. But Willis, who in the last year has become one of the country's top Tetris players, is thought to be the first to do it on the original hardware.
"It's never been done by a human before," said Vince Clemente, the president of the Classic Tetris World Championship, adding, "It's basically something that everyone thought was impossible until a couple of years ago."
In the competitive Tetris world, the object is generally to outscore your opponents rather than to outlast them. "Trying for the crash" is a different approach entirely. It's an act of survival.
"The main strategy is just playing as safe as you can," Willis said.
It's a bit more complicated than that, said David Macdonald, a video game content creator and competitive Tetris player known as aGameScout. In recent years, top players have begun using the "rolling technique," a quick tapping method using several fingers instead of just one or two. This innovation has changed what is possible in competitive Tetris. More top players are "going for the crash," as opposed to simply accumulating as many points as possible before being defeated by the game.
And now Willis has raised the bar.
"This Tetris prodigy has just come up and just completely taken over the pro Tetris scene," Mr. Macdonald said.
Willis has already won several regional tournaments, and his goal is to win the Classic Tetris World Championship, in which he placed third overall in October. Willis's next tournament is at the end of the month in Waco, Texas. So far, he has made about $ 3,000 from playing in Tetris tournaments.
His achievement will unlock new frontiers for Tetris players to explore. For example, Willis triggered the freeze by clearing a single row of blocks. A double-row clear may not have frozen the game, Mr. Macdonald said. The game was never meant to go that long, he said, and no one had ever reached a trigger point like that.
"Now that it's been done, there's kind of a new phase or a new challenge," Mr. Macdonald said. "When we all found out this past year that, 'Oh, the crash is possible, you could do it at this level,' then people started racing to be the first to do it. But now there's a whole new challenge, which is basically now, instead of going through the crash, how long can you go beyond the crash?"
As far as Willis goes, don't expect to see him playing a PlayStation 5 anytime soon.
"I don't really like newer games as much as the older games," he said.

New York's King of the Magnet Fishers: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: James Kane was not afraid of the grenade. Not even a little bit. But he was feeling a rush of adrenaline.
After all, finding an antique weapon in Sheepshead Bay was a big deal for someone who desperately wants to be noticed. A YouTube video of a grenade being pulled from the water along the Brooklyn shoreline could be viral gold. "Some magnet fishers go their whole lives without this happening," Mr. Kane said, pacing the boardwalk excitedly. "I've never won a lottery in my entire life -- even a scratch-off. This is historic. It's pure frickin' insanity. One hundred percent."
Mr. Kane is a magnet fisher, which is exactly what it sounds like: He regularly tosses a magnet into the water to see what comes out. This became an oddly popular hobby during the pandemic, though Mr. Kane claims to be the only person who does it in New York City. This may or may not be true, but he definitely has an insider's perspective on the city's waterways.
He was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Queens, and he spent a year staring at the shore when he had a job with NYC Ferry. He also pulled shifts as a crane operator for a sanitation company, an education in just how much stuff is at the bottom of places like the East River. For the past five months, he has been treating magnet fishing as a full-time job.
The grenade was not without precedent. Two months before, Mr. Kane managed to pull a gun out of a lake near where he lives. It might have been used in a murder, he suggested, and he was told there was a chance he might be subpoenaed. He was eager to avoid that entanglement.
On that unseasonably warm November afternoon, Mr. Kane, who is 39 and looks a bit like the actor Seth Rogen playing a deckhand, just yanked the thing right off his magnet. It took quite a bit of effort, given that the magnet (from Kratos Magnetics, for $ 140) was advertised as having a "pull force" of 3,800 pounds. The gunpowder had been emptied out of the bottom, so he figured the corroded explosive was something that would put him on the map, rather than blow him off it. Still, he put it on the ground and covered it with a plastic bucket -- just in case.
As he dialed 911, he paused to wonder: Would the operator remember him? Was he something of a known quantity by now? Just the week before, he'd found a top-loading Smith & Wesson in Prospect Park Lake. And he'd also found a completely different grenade about a month ago, which he said led the police to evacuate a restaurant near the United Nations. But to his disappointment, that day's dispatcher didn't react.
"You're gonna know Let's Get Magnetic," Mr. Kane told the operator, referencing the name of his YouTube channel. "I'm getting famous."
His partner, Barbie Agostini, continued filming as the police arrived. Two beat cops who showed up took some pictures of the grenade on their phones. Meanwhile, a woman pushed a baby carriage inches away from it. More cops eventually came to cordon off the area, but the content creation did not stop there. Another officer squatted on the ground to take more close-ups. Wanting a wider-angle view of the ruckus he'd wrought, Mr. Kane moved slightly down the sidewalk and kept fishing.
It wasn't long before a well-put-together young woman in a pinned-on hat stopped and stared as Mr. Kane pulled a hunk of junk out of the water with his magnet.
"What are you guys fishing for?" she asked.
"Anything metal," he told her. "This is a bed frame from the 1900s."
The woman looked astounded at this dubious bit of history.
"God bless you," she said.
Several weekends after the grenade, Mr. Kane was celebrating. Let's Get Magnetic had just hit 1,000 subscribers on YouTube. It's a small audience, but it meant he could finally monetize his channel. He, Ms. Agostini, and her 15-year-old son, Jose, were at a pizza joint in the Jamaica Hills neighborhood of Queens. They ordered a large pie and talked about how far they'd come, and what might be next.
Before he'd turned to magnet fishing, Mr. Kane used to stream himself playing video games. Not only was he unsuccessful at making a living that way, but his attempts were detrimental to his health. When he died in a game like "Doom," his blood pressure would spike. "Your body thinks it's dying in real life," he explained. "One hundred percent."
"It took us long enough to get into a relationship," Ms. Agostini said while dousing her slice in oregano flakes. "I don't need you dying on me."
Mr. Kane and Ms. Agostini have known each other practically since birth. The way they tell the story, their moms met on the subway, became drinking buddies, and both decided to adopt children around the same time. When they were young, they were inseparable, but then they lost touch, when Mr. Kane spent some time living on the streets. A job program got him back on his feet, and then he reconnected with Barbie on Facebook.
They became more than friends in 2016 and eventually moved in together, Barbie bringing her son, Jose, and her daughter, Rebecca. Things were going well -- great, actually -- until Covid hit. The schools closed, and then Ms. Agostini needed back surgery. Mr. Kane was forced to resign from the crane operating job he'd grown to like, because someone needed to take care of the children. "The pandemic absolutely destroyed us," he said.
As the sole breadwinner for his new family, Mr. Kane scrambled to come up with a way to work from home. So he tried his hand at streaming until the blood-pressure issues arose. Not to mention all the sitting. His new avocation is much more flexible and more active, which isn't to say it is without risk.
"I would get cut with bike spokes through my gloves," Mr. Kane remembers. "I've been poked by acupuncture needles that someone dumped in Corona Park. There's green slime. I just fought on and got my tetanus shot, and I haven't gotten sick yet."
While Mr. Kane still dreams of finding a treasure chest full of coins, he mostly finds junk. One-off pieces of silverware are still considered a decent score -- they're apparently fine to use after they've been boiled for an hour. But sometimes the family will luck out.
He once found a bag with $ 200 worth of waterlogged bills in it. Another time he found an iPhone 13. The owner let him keep it. It's now what Ms. Agostini, who used to work with developmentally disabled adults before her back surgery, uses to film her family's exploits on the water. She loves her new career as a videographer and internet researcher. "It's the poor man's archaeology," she explained.
Mr. Kane maintains that this iPhone will launch him into YouTube stardom. He speaks reverently about other magnet fishers with hundreds of thousands of subscribers, most of them based in Europe. For his line of work, he recognizes that being in New York is a handicap -- nothing here is that old, and American coins are not magnetic.
He's also not sure he's willing to submerge himself in the hyperpolluted East River to find the really good stuff. But his biggest issue is that everything in the city is so regulated -- he's been threatened with arrest several times, even though he insists that what he does is completely legal. Still, he is storing a cache of weapons at his apartment -- or at least parts of weapons.
After lunch, Mr. Kane, Ms. Agostini and Jose returned to their duplex. Mr. Kane pulled out a Styrofoam chest full of his favorite finds. They included the magazines from four guns, the barrel of a sniper rifle and two tiny cannonballs that might predate the city itself, which he plans on giving to the American Museum of Natural History.
Evidence of a collector's lifestyle exists throughout the apartment -- unopened retro video games and hand-painted Japanese anime figurines covered nearly every spare inch of wall space. Mr. Kane pulled out some tiny pieces of metal from the cooler, one in the shape of a bow and arrow, and another that looked like a ball-peen hammer.
"This is black magic," he said. "One hundred percent." Then came a key fob for an Audi that still lit up when he pressed a button. "This unlocks a car," he said. "We just don't know where the car is." Then came his collection of iPhones, which he proudly displayed on his purple couch. All of them worked. Well, all but one. "It smokes if you turn it on," he said. "But that's the only problem."
Mr. Kane has cast his magnet at dozens of sites so far and has a lead on a spot near Kennedy Airport. And he has a litany of ideas on how to cash in. He wants his family to become famous. And a popular channel could be a way to launch their own line of personal protective equipment that's specific to magnet fishing -- or to sell a slingshot-like device that would allow someone to fling a magnet super far.
But Mr. Kane could just as happily work for the city, helping to clean out ponds and playgrounds. Or he could get hired to teach children about magnet fishing, and therefore the history of New York. Although he claimed that magnet fishing in public made him feel anxious, it was clear he had the personality for such a gig.
You could tell by the way he worked the boardwalk in Sheepshead Bay.
A crowd was also beginning to form from a nearby park and the dialysis center across the street, including some metal detectorists and people who'd collected coins in their youth. Even if he'd yet to become famous, Mr. Kane was clearly enjoying putting on a show. He was yukking it up as he pulled a shopping cart from Marshall's out of the water. People gasped and jumped up onto park benches as he pulled up a giant pipe, its occupant slithering out and skittering all over the place. A live eel in Brooklyn!
As he was waiting for someone to deal with the grenade, Mr. Kane also managed to pull three bicycles, a vintage municipal trash can and a kitchen sink onto Emmons Avenue. He hauled in a car boot, which supposedly can't be removed from an illegally parked car without destroying the wheel it is clamped to. It was unclear how it ended up in Sheepshead Bay.
Finally, the bomb squad arrived. A man in a white zip-up sweater stepped over the yellow tape and peered at the grenade. As he picked it up and took it back toward the van he'd arrived in, Mr. Kane yelled from down the block, as if he was trying to flag down an A-list celebrity for a selfie. He mostly wanted to know if he could keep his find as a souvenir, though the officer had to inform him that the charge in this World War II-era training grenade was still active. So the answer was a definite no.
Mr. Kane was disappointed, but he considered that he'd had any dialogue with someone from the bomb squad a huge win for his career as a magnet fisher. After all, who could forget the guy who found a real, live grenade in Brooklyn?

NEW YORK — James Kane was not afraid of the grenade. Not even a little bit. But he was feeling a rush of adrenaline.
After all, finding an antique weapon in Sheepshead Bay was a big deal for someone who desperately wants to be noticed. A YouTube video of a grenade being pulled from the water along the New York City shoreline could be viral gold. “Some magnet fishers go their whole lives without this happening,” Kane said, pacing the boardwalk excitedly. “I’ve never won a lottery in my entire life — even a scratch-off. This is historic. It’s pure frickin’ insanity. One hundred percent.”
Kane is a magnet fisher, which is exactly what it sounds like: He regularly tosses a magnet into the water to see what comes out. This became an oddly popular hobby during the pandemic, though Kane claims to be the only person who does it in New York City. This may or may not be true, but he definitely has an insider’s perspective on the city’s waterways.
He was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Queens, and he spent a year staring at the shore when he had a job with NYC Ferry. He also pulled shifts as a crane operator for a sanitation company, an education in just how much stuff is at the bottom of places like the East River. For the past five months, he has been treating magnet fishing as a full-time job.
The grenade was not without precedent. Two months before, Kane managed to pull a gun out of a lake near where he lives. It might have been used in a murder, he suggested, and he was told there was a chance he might be subpoenaed. He was eager to avoid that entanglement.
On that unseasonably warm November afternoon, Kane, who is 39 and looks a bit like actor Seth Rogen playing a deckhand, just yanked the thing right off his magnet. It took quite a bit of effort, given that the magnet (from Kratos Magnetics, for $140) was advertised as having a “pull force” of 3,800 pounds. The gunpowder had been emptied out of the bottom, so he figured the corroded explosive was something that would put him on the map rather than blow him off it. Still, he put it on the ground and covered it with a plastic bucket — just in case.
As he dialed 911, he paused to wonder: Would the operator remember him? Was he something of a known quantity by now? Just the week before, he’d found a top-loading Smith & Wesson in Prospect Park Lake. And he’d also found a completely different grenade about a month ago, which he said led the police to evacuate a restaurant near the United Nations. But to his disappointment, that day’s dispatcher didn’t react.
“You’re gonna know Let’s Get Magnetic,” Kane told the operator, referencing the name of his YouTube channel. “I’m getting famous.”
His partner, Barbie Agostini, continued filming as the police arrived. Two beat cops who showed up took some pictures of the grenade on their phones. Meanwhile, a woman pushed a baby carriage inches away from it. More cops eventually came to cordon off the area, but the content creation did not stop there. Another officer squatted on the ground to take more close-ups. Wanting a wider-angle view of the ruckus he’d wrought, Kane moved slightly down the sidewalk and kept fishing.
It wasn’t long before a well-put-together young woman in a pinned-on hat stopped and stared as Kane pulled a hunk of junk out of the water with his magnet.
“What are you guys fishing for?” she asked.
“Anything metal,” he told her. “This is a bed frame,” he said, “from the 1900s.”
The woman looked astounded at this dubious bit of history.
“God bless you,” she said.
Several weekends after the grenade, Kane was celebrating. Let’s Get Magnetic had just hit 1,000 subscribers on YouTube. It’s a small audience, but it meant he could finally monetize his channel. He, Agostini, and her 15-year-old son, Jose, were at a pizza joint in the Jamaica Hills neighborhood of Queens. They ordered a large pie and talked about how far they’d come and what might be next.
Before he’d turned to magnet fishing, Kane used to stream himself playing video games. Not only was he unsuccessful at making a living that way, but his attempts were detrimental to his health. When he died in a game like “Doom,” his blood pressure would spike. “Your body thinks it’s dying in real life,” he explained. “One hundred percent.”
“It took us long enough to get into a relationship,” Agostini said while dousing her slice in oregano flakes. “I don’t need you dying on me.”
Kane and Agostini have known each other practically since birth. The way they tell the story, their moms met on the subway, became drinking buddies, and both decided to adopt children around the same time. When they were young, they were inseparable, but then they lost touch when Kane spent some time living on the streets. A job program got him back on his feet, and then he reconnected with Agostini on Facebook.
They became more than friends in 2016 and eventually moved in together, Agostini bringing her son, Jose, and her daughter, Rebecca. Things were going well — great, actually — until COVID hit. The schools closed, and then Agostini needed back surgery. Kane was forced to resign from the crane operating job he’d grown to like, because someone needed to take care of the children. “The pandemic absolutely destroyed us,” he said.
As the sole breadwinner for his new family, Kane scrambled to come up with a way to work from home. So he tried his hand at streaming until the blood pressure issues arose, not to mention all the sitting. His new avocation is much more flexible and more active, which isn’t to say it is without risk.
“I would get cut with bike spokes through my gloves,” Kane remembers. “I’ve been poked by acupuncture needles that someone dumped in Corona Park. There’s green slime. I just fought on and got my tetanus shot, and I haven’t gotten sick yet.”
While Kane still dreams of finding a treasure chest full of coins, he mostly finds junk. One-off pieces of silverware are still considered a decent score; they’re apparently fine to use after they’ve been boiled for an hour. But sometimes the family will luck out.
He once found a bag with $200 worth of waterlogged bills in it. Another time, he found an iPhone 13. The owner let him keep it. It’s now what Agostini, who used to work with developmentally disabled adults before her back surgery, uses to film her family’s exploits on the water. She loves her new career as a videographer and internet researcher. “It’s the poor man’s archaeology,” she explained.
Kane maintains that this iPhone will launch him into YouTube stardom. He speaks reverently about other magnet fishers with hundreds of thousands of subscribers, most of them based in Europe. For his line of work, he recognizes that being in New York is a handicap; nothing here is that old, and American coins are not magnetic.
He’s also not sure he’s willing to submerge himself in the hyperpolluted East River to find the really good stuff. But his biggest issue is that everything in the city is so regulated; he’s been threatened with arrest several times, even though he insists that what he does is completely legal. Still, he is storing a cache of weapons at his apartment — or at least parts of weapons.
After lunch, Kane, Agostini and Jose returned to their duplex. Kane pulled out a Styrofoam chest full of his favorite finds. They included the magazines from four guns, the barrel of a sniper rifle and two tiny cannonballs that might predate the city itself, which he plans on giving to the American Museum of Natural History.
Evidence of a collector’s lifestyle exists throughout the apartment; unopened retro video games and hand-painted Japanese anime figurines covered nearly every spare inch of wall space. Kane pulled out some tiny pieces of metal from the cooler, one in the shape of a bow and arrow, and another that looked like a ball-peen hammer.
“This is black magic,” he said. “One hundred percent.” Then came a key fob for an Audi that still lit up when he pressed a button. “This unlocks a car,” he said. “We just don’t know where the car is.” Then came his collection of iPhones, which he proudly displayed on his purple couch. All of them worked. Well, all but one. “It smokes if you turn it on,” he said. “But that’s the only problem.”
Kane has cast his magnet at dozens of sites so far and has a lead on a spot near Kennedy Airport. And he has a litany of ideas on how to cash in. He wants his family to become famous. And a popular channel could be a way to launch their own line of personal protective equipment that’s specific to magnet fishing — or to sell a slingshotlike device that would allow someone to fling a magnet super far.
But Kane could just as happily work for the city, helping to clean out ponds and playgrounds. Or he could get hired to teach children about magnet fishing, and therefore the history of New York. Although he claimed that magnet fishing in public made him feel anxious, it was clear he had the personality for such a gig.
You could tell by the way he worked the boardwalk in Sheepshead Bay.
A crowd was also beginning to form from a nearby park and the dialysis center across the street, including some metal detectorists and people who’d collected coins in their youth. Even if he’d yet to become famous, Kane was clearly enjoying putting on a show. He was yukking it up as he pulled a shopping cart from Marshalls out of the water. People gasped and jumped up onto park benches as he pulled up a giant pipe, its occupant slithering out and skittering all over the place. A live eel in Brooklyn!
As he was waiting for someone to deal with the grenade, Kane also managed to pull three bicycles, a vintage municipal trash can and a kitchen sink onto Emmons Avenue. He hauled in a car boot, which supposedly can’t be removed from an illegally parked car without destroying the wheel it is clamped to. It was unclear how it ended up in Sheepshead Bay.
Finally, the bomb squad arrived. A man in a white zip-up sweater stepped over the yellow tape and peered at the grenade. As he picked it up and took it back toward the van he’d arrived in, Kane yelled from down the block as if he was trying to flag down an A-list celebrity for a selfie. He mostly wanted to know if he could keep his find as a souvenir, though the officer had to inform him that the charge in this World War II-era training grenade was still active. So the answer was a definite no.
Kane was disappointed, but he considered that he’d had any dialogue with someone from the bomb squad — a huge win for his career as a magnet fisher. After all, who could forget the guy who found a real, live grenade in Brooklyn?
“I almost killed everyone in the area,” he said. “But that definitely would have been on the news.”

Moviegoers Tuned Out Spectacle in 2023: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Movie audiences flocked to Taylor Swift, "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" but were cooler toward returning superheroes like the Flash, Captain Marvel and Aquaman.
Hollywood's movie factories run on conventional wisdom -- entrenched notions, based on experience, about what types of films are likely to pop at the global box office.
This year, audiences turned many of those so-called rules on their heads.
Superheroes have long been seen as the most reliable way to fill seats. But characters like Captain Marvel, the Flash, Ant-Man, Shazam and Blue Beetle failed to excite moviegoers. Over the weekend, "Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom," which cost more than $ 200 million to make and tens of millions more to market, arrived to a disastrous $ 28 million in ticket sales in the United States and Canada. Overseas moviegoers chipped in another $ 80 million.
In the meantime, the biggest movie of the year at the box office, "Barbie," with $ 1.44 billion in worldwide ticket sales, was directed by a woman, based on a very female toy and spray-painted pink -- ingredients that most studios have long seen as limiting audience appeal. An old movie-industry maxim holds that women will go to a "guy" movie but not vice versa.
"The Super Mario Bros. Movie" collected $ 1.36 billion, a second-place result that also stunned Hollywood; studios have a troubled history with game adaptations. "Oppenheimer," a three-hour period drama about a physicist, rounded out the top three, taking in $ 952 million and contradicting the prevailing belief that, in the streaming era, films for grown-ups are not viable in theaters.
"Without question, change is afoot -- audiences are in a different mood," said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers. "The country and the world are not in the same place. We've had seven years of divisive politics, a severe pandemic, two serious wars, climate change and inflation. Moviegoers seem less interested in being overwhelmed with spectacle and saving the universe than being spoken to, entertained and inspired."
The biggest box office surprises of the year fell into the "spoken to" category. "Sound of Freedom," a crime drama that cost $ 15 million to make, catered to the far right, an audience largely ignored by Hollywood, and generated $ 248 million in ticket sales, on a par with "The Eras Tour," which targeted Taylor Swift fans and also cost about $ 15 million.
"Sound of Freedom" came from Angel Studios, an independent company in Provo, Utah, that supported the film with an unorthodox "Pay It Forward" program, which let supporters buy tickets online for those who otherwise might not see it. In a big break from Hollywood norms, Ms. Swift cut out the middle company (a studio) and made a distribution deal directly with AMC Entertainment, the world's largest theater operator.
"Our phone has been dancing off the hooks since the day we announced the 'Eras Tour' project," Adam Aron, AMC's chief executive, told investors on a conference call in November, referring to "alternative content" opportunities.
Comscore, which compiles box office data, projected on Sunday that North American ticket sales for the year would reach about $ 9 billion, a 20 percent increase from 2022. (Before the pandemic, North American theaters reliably sold about $ 11 billion in tickets annually.) The average price for an adult general admission ticket in the United States was $ 12.14, up from $ 11.75, according to EntTelligence, a research firm.
Worldwide ticket sales are expected to exceed $ 33 billion, an increase of 27 percent, partly because of a surge in Latin America. (Before the pandemic, worldwide ticket sales easily exceeded $ 40 billion annually.)
Hollywood's climb back from the pandemic is expected to stall in 2024. With fewer movies scheduled for release -- studio pipelines were disrupted by the recent strikes -- ticket sales will decline 5 to 11 percent next year, depending on the market, according to projections from Gower Street Analytics, a box office research firm.
Reading box-office tea leaves is like pontificating about symbolism in works of fiction: Any halfway plausible theory works. But studio bosses need something, anything, to guide them as they make billion-dollar judgment calls for the seasons ahead.
Here are five takeaways from this year:
Moviegoers want comfort.
People reach for nostalgia in times of stress, and movies that reminded audiences of the past -- while also managing to feel fresh -- have been succeeding. "Barbie," "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," "The Little Mermaid," "Wonka" and the retro-feeling "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem" allowed people to revisit their childhoods. "Insidious: The Red Door" hit pay dirt by bringing back the franchise's original stars.
"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny" could have tapped into nostalgia to become a hit. Instead, a huffing and puffing Harrison Ford, 81, simply reminded Indy fans that they, too, are getting old. "Dial of Destiny" cost Disney $ 295 million to make and took in a flaccid $ 384 million. (Theaters keep roughly 50 percent of ticket sales.)
Art film has a pulse.
Sophisticated dramas with modest budgets and aimed at older audiences have been showing signs of life after two years in the box office I.C.U.
The streaming era has forever shifted the bulk of prestige film viewing to the home, analysts say. But theaters found a modicum of success in 2023 with offerings like "Past Lives," a wistful drama with some Korean dialogue, and Hayao Miyazaki's animated "The Boy and the Heron." The bespoke "Asteroid City" managed $ 54 million.
Early box office results have also been promising for Oscar-oriented films like "Poor Things," a surreal science-fiction romance, and "American Fiction," a satire about a writer who puts together a fake memoir that turns on racial stereotypes.
Bigger is not better.
For the past decade, Hollywood has kept audiences interested in sequels by making each installment more bloated and often nonsensical than the last. Bigger! Faster! More!
That strategy may need rethinking -- it's just too expensive, analysts say, especially with Chinese moviegoers souring on American blockbusters. "Fast X," the 10th movie in the "Fast and Furious" series, cost an estimated $ 340 million and took in $ 705 million worldwide, including $ 140 million in China. By comparison, "Furious 7" in 2015 cost $ 190 million and collected $ 1.5 billion, including $ 391 million in China.
Tom Cruise's seventh "Mission: Impossible" spectacle, released in July in the wake of "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer," cost roughly $ 290 million to make and collected $ 568 million, including $ 49 million in China. The sixth "Mission: Impossible" in 2018 cost $ 178 million and generated $ 792 million, with Chinese ticket buyers chipping in $ 181 million.
Increasingly, franchise sequels and spinoffs need to feel fresh to succeed. Lionsgate, for instance, delved deeper into the High Table underground crime organization in "John Wick: Chapter 4" and introduced "Hunger Games" fans to a new story line (and cast) in the prequel "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes." Both movies were hits. Lionsgate even revived its "Saw" horror franchise by shifting the narrative back in time.
"Each of those movies did something different than the prior," said Adam Fogelson, vice chair of the Lionsgate Motion Picture Group. "It wasn't just 'spend more, make it bigger, make it louder and cram in more action."'
Some audience patterns remain intact.
Horror continued to be a reliable performer, with "Five Nights at Freddy's" and "M3gan" starting new franchises for Universal and its Blumhouse affiliate. Together, the two films cost $ 32 million. They collected a combined $ 469 million. Also notable was "The Nun II," which cost Warner Bros. about $ 38 million and took in $ 268 million.
Superheroes may be down, but they're not out. Marvel's rollicking, well-established "Guardians of the Galaxy" series returned for a third chapter and generated $ 846 million against a $ 250 million budget. Sony's bold, anime-influenced "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" cost an estimated $ 150 million and collected $ 691 million.
Stars matter.
The conventional wisdom in Hollywood has been that movie stars are essentially part of the past. A celebrity name above the title no longer carries that much weight with ticket buyers. The underlying "intellectual property" is what fills seats.
People pay to see Barbie, not Margot Robbie.
Except that Mattel and various studios tried for at least 20 years to turn the toy into a live-action movie star. It took Ms. Robbie in the role (and Ryan Gosling as Ken) to finally make it happen. Other movies that benefited from star power in 2023 included "Wonka," with Timothée Chalamet, and "Creed III," anchored by Michael B. Jordan.
Stars don't have heft? Try telling that to the producers of "Gran Turismo," "Haunted Mansion," "Dumb Money" and "Strays," all of which disappointed at the box office and arrived when their casts were barred from promoting their work because of the SAG-AFTRA strike.

In a Game, There Are New Selves To Reveal: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Transgender people have turned to games, some with robust character creators, as places where they can safely express themselves.
Nearly a decade before Anna Anthropy came out as a transgender woman, she was wearing a dress in the world of Animal Crossing on the Nintendo GameCube, leaving virtual bread crumbs for her family about information she was not prepared to share as a teenager.
"We were all playing in the same town, and I had chosen a female character," said Anthropy, 40, now a professor of game design at DePaul University, in Chicago. "It wasn't something we talked about, but it was my way of seeing a version of my family where I was the right gender."
More than a dozen transgender and nonbinary people said in interviews that video games were one of the safest spaces to explore their queer identities, given the array of tools to modify a character's appearance and a virtual world that readily accepts those changes.
Character creation tools in role-playing games like Starfield and Baldur's Gate 3 are making fewer gendered assumptions than in the past, giving players more freedom to select pronouns, shape their bodies and select a vocal range. Those new options are leading some players to spend hours creating their virtual avatars.
Veronica Ripley, 32, often speaks to friends about the role that video games played in her trans awakening: "I would try to explain it away, saying that I was playing the girl character because she had a smaller hitbox or quicker kill animations," she said, referring to in-game advantages. Then she found herself exploring The Sims, which she described as a "virtual dollhouse simulator" that allowed her to create feminine versions of herself.
"To be a girl in that space was transcendent as a kid," Ripley said.
Medical professionals have said in recent years that video games can be a form of gender-affirming care. Some research indicates that games that allow players to express their gender identities without pushback helped those transitioning become more comfortable in the real world.
"Many folks who are trans and nonbinary do not grow up with a safe avenue to play, which is due to pressures in their environments," said Sien Rivera, a psychiatrist based in South Carolina who has researched the topic. "Video games offer this cushion to allow for a private world that is separate from the immediate corporeal reality, yet also shared with so many other people across the world who are sharing in these imaginative experiences."
Rivera, who chairs the committee on gender and sexuality for the American Psychoanalytic Association, added that "the video game is the only place where they can have some representation of themselves that more accurately represents their psychic reality."
Three years ago, Nora Vind published a video essay comparing her experience coming out as transgender to the transformative experience of Madeline, a character in the 2018 game Celeste whose own journey of self-discovery is symbolized by a treacherous mountain climb.
"Even before I knew I was escaping, I was escaping into video games," Vind, now a 23-year-old university student in Denmark, said in an interview. "And there was a scene in that game where Madeline calls her mom to say she feels overwhelmed. It gave me the courage to talk to my mother about being trans the next time I went home."
It helped that Maddy Thorson, the designer behind Celeste, had written an essay describing how the game's development coincided with her own journey of trans discovery.
"The story of Celeste really began with thinking about why I play hard games and why somebody would do that," Thorson recalled in an interview. But in retrospect, she realized that her protagonist shared some of her own story. "It didn't feel like inventing something, it felt like discovering something."
Physical and online communities have been an important resource for transgender gamers at a time when many say they feel threatened in public by rhetoric and violence.
In 2018, Raffy Regulus helped found NYC Gaymers, which hosts mixers and game nights in the city and has grown its membership to more than 1,500 people. Ripley founded Transmission Gaming in 2016 after experiences with online bullies who mocked her voice; almost 2,500 members belong to its Discord channel, where players can meet and organize tournaments. The group's tagline? "This is not a safe space. This is a trans space." It is a competitive gaming space, after all.
Platforms like Twitch and YouTube, where people livestream themselves playing games, have also helped magnify moments of self-discovery. "Streaming changed the equation because it made a public forum," said Joanna Fang, a foley artist in the video game industry.
"As the world becomes more aggressive toward trans people," she added, "video games can bridge the gaps between communities."
Beyond the virtual raves and multiplayer tournaments that Fang attended during the coronavirus pandemic, she also joined an online group called TransGameDev, which included more than 1,300 transgender members. She said the group had been a positive influence on the industry, helping more transgender people discuss game design and find jobs.
Managers at Larian Studios credited transgender and nonbinary employees for improving the character creator that contributed to the success of the role-playing game Baldur's Gate 3. One of this year's most celebrated releases, the game was praised for its customizability and branching story lines that capture the spontaneity of tabletop Dungeons & Dragons games.
"We definitely learned that we needed to be very open-minded and not restrict ourselves," said Alena Dubrovina, an art director at Larian who oversaw the character creator. "A huge design pillar was allowing players to live their ultimate fantasies."
An important step toward that goal was the decision to include genitals among the physical traits that could be customized, with different shapes available.
Gender expression makes little difference to the game's narrative, which some transgender players celebrated. "Those decisions are just for us," Vind said. "You choose those options, and everyone will treat your character normally."
Transgender visibility in gaming can sometimes be a double-edged sword for developers.
Anthropy, the game design professor, said that releasing an autobiographical game in 2012 about her own transition, called Dys4ia, brought unwanted attention from cisgender people looking to generalize about transgender culture from her individual experience. "I had made it for other trans people, but it was quickly appropriated into a larger conversation," she said.
Though she occasionally receives emails from players saying they appreciated the game's exploration of the physical and emotional changes that accompany transitioning between genders, Anthropy said she never wanted Dys4ia to become an "empathy game" that taught others how to feel.
But she could understand the impulse. "So much of gender performance is play: trying on roles and seeing how they fit," Anthropy said.
After much thought -- and years of distance -- she recently decided to republish the game. Writing on her blog, she suggested that how she perceived the game was connected to difficult moments in her transition.
"This game is not the burnout I've spent so many years recovering from," Anthropy wrote, adding, "It's a journal I kept during a moment of incredible, terrifying, beautiful changes in my life."

Spellbinding Choices in a Surprise Hit: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The rules are so complex an engineer with a Ph.D. was baffled. The setting was long the butt of jokes. Combat proceeds at the pace of a courtly duel. And some of the biggest names in video games released competing titles.
But Baldur's Gate 3, a game that lets you talk to spiders and the dead, slip through cracks as a cloud of mist, reveal invisible foes by splashing them with drinks, bargain with a devil, give your eye to a hag and romance an amnesiac priestess or a squid-faced telepath, as you see fit turned into the surprise hit of 2023.
The chief executive of Larian Studios had told his team to expect about 100,000 concurrent players when it fully released Baldur's Gate 3, a role-playing game based on Dungeons & Dragons. A few days later, nearly 900,000 people were playing at the same time.
Actors soon began to hear from players moved by their performances as a debonair vampire and a green otherworldly warrior, among others. Critics praised the game's sweeping freedom and the depth of its writing. PC Gamer gave its highest review score in 16 years to Baldur's Gate 3, which went on to win game of the year accolades in Britain and the United States.
The staggering success was no sure thing.
"I did not think that it was going to flop," said Josh Sawyer, the studio design director at a competitor, Obsidian Entertainment, and the lead designer on Fallout: New Vegas and Pillars of Eternity. "I did not think that it was going to be niche niche. But it was hard for me to see the return on the investment."
Larian spent six years creating Baldur's Gate 3, pouring money and talent -- its cast of nearly 250 actors includes the Oscar winner J.K. Simmons -- into a throwback game.
Although role-playing games remain popular, the genre has largely moved on from the turn-based combat and isometric design that was more common when the first two Baldur's Gate titles were released in 1998 and 2000.
As role-playing games became more like cinematic action games, other genres began adopting their principles. Soldiers in Call of Duty started earning experience points and leveling up, not unlike the gnomes and half-orcs of tabletop games.
But Larian, previously known for its Divinity role-playing series, had an uncompromising vision for Baldur's Gate 3. Swen Vincke, the Belgian studio's founder and chief executive, said the company wanted to create a game that would truly let each player have a different adventure based on the branching consequences of decisions, big and small.
"They managed to fulfill the ultimate player fantasy of having influence over the story, often in very dramatic and unexpected ways," said Sebastian Kalemba, a game director at CD Projekt Red, which made The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Cyberpunk 2077. "I felt that I was discovering the world on my own and had the opportunity to experiment endlessly."
At a goblin lair early in Baldur's Gate 3, players can barge in with swords swinging, lure goblins into traps or poison their punch. There is no shortage of tactics. Players can push enemies into a spider pit or convince the spiders to revolt; join the goblins' cause or pretend to do so; quietly take out their leaders or lead them into a distant battle -- and then decide whether to betray them.
Adam Smith, the game's lead writer, said the goal was to create a fleshed-out world for every scenario imaginable, even those that only 0.01 percent of players would ever see.
"We made it at a scale that we thought might be impossible," he said. "And it turned out it wasn't."
Developers throughout the video game industry attributed the effusive praise of Baldur's Gate 3 to its complex but approachable system, high production values and emphasis on creativity and memorable characters. A bard might bluff and deceive his way through the Forgotten Realms, while a barbarian cannonballs through them.
There also had been no big-budget game quite like it in several years, said David Gaider, who worked on Baldur's Gate II and is now the creative director of Summerfall Studios. Its reception, he said, showed that fans were hungry for a meaty, narrative role-playing experience.
"For a game with so many old-fashioned features in it, it's really served to dispel a bit of that so-called industry wisdom about what the audience will and will not accept," said Gaider, the lead writer of Dragon Age titles. "People just want good games, don't they?"
Baldur's Gate 3 has drawn in millions, including the chief executive of Hasbro, Chris Cocks, who said in an email that he had spent more than 160 hours with a half-elf sorcerer named Quincy Tipperton. Part of the appeal was forcing players to confront the often surprising results of their choices, as well as the random rolls of a 20-sided die.
That also made building the game enormously complicated: The abundant rules of Dungeons & Dragons were not simple to adapt, especially its spells.
"My lead gameplay programmer had to explain to a guy who had a Ph.D. how it works, and he spent an hour trying to explain to him spell-slot systems, because he had to implement it," Vincke said. "It was crazy. We had many arguments."
Despite the challenges, the scope of the game grew. Neil Newbon, the actor who plays the vampire, Astarion, called it "a spider's web madness of narrative nodes."
A team of about 12 writers developed hundreds of pages' worth of dialogue, in-game books and descriptions of items and skills, trying to account for whatever a player might want to do. Actors spent years getting in and out of motion-capture suits, recording more and more lines. (Including distinct dialogue for both a spell that allows characters to speak to animals and a skill to "handle" them.) Larian said the 174 hours of cinematic material it produced was more than twice the length of "Game of Thrones."
There was so much material that Devora Wilde, who voices the warrior, Lae'zel, said that while playing through the game herself she was sometimes taken aback encountering dialogue she had recorded years earlier.
"It was being written as we were going along," she said. "I couldn't play the ending because I didn't know."
The ambition was so great that Larian could not achieve everything it had imagined.
Smith said he would have liked to add depth to the relationships with companions, creating more nuance in moments of romantic rejection and platonic friendship. The classic spell Dispel Magic proved too disruptive for a virtual world full of magic. And a plan was scrapped, Vincke said, to send players who had died to adventures in the Fugue Plane, an afterlife zone in D&D lore.
"Everything you've done would have stacked up in the Fugue Plane," he said, "so you would have been confronted with the consequences of your actions."
Although the original Baldur's Gate games by BioWare are regarded as masterpieces of their time, the series sat dormant for many years.
Once Wizards of the Coast, the Hasbro unit that runs Dungeons & Dragons, reacquired the legal rights, it reached a deal with Larian, which had fund-raised on Kickstarter to help make Divinity: Original Sin and its sequel.
Larian is privately owned, so it faced less pressure during Baldur's Gate 3's lengthy development process than many studios do under the umbrella of a corporate giant like Microsoft or Electronic Arts. But the investment was still a risk.
"It's a rarefied air when you get to spend that kind of money and on a genre that traditionally doesn't break out," said Ben Smedstad, who worked on the original Baldur's Gate games. "That's a gamble. That takes some guts."
It was not always a smooth journey. The coronavirus pandemic disrupted production, as did Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which forced Larian to move a team who had been based in St. Petersburg.
But Baldur's Gate 3 benefited from the three years it spent in early access, a period when people can buy and play an in-progress game. The increasingly common strategy gives a studio additional time and resources to make improvements, along with valuable feedback.
"Our initial approaches weren't that successful," Vincke said, adding, "We had ideas, and we were told in friendly and sometimes not-so-friendly manners that maybe we should rethink some of these ideas."
Larian was responsive, engaging directly with players and delivering updates in conversational posts.
"Nintendo is like a far-off entity that you couldn't even, for a moment, consider would see anything you have to say," said Liv Kennedy, a co-host of the podcast "3 Black Halflings." "Larian's almost like a bespoke game developer."
The year was full of new role-playing games expected to be bigger hits: Diablo IV by Activision Blizzard, Final Fantasy XVI by Square Enix, Starfield by Bethesda Game Studios and an expansion to Cyberpunk 2077. But in the months before the arrival of Baldur's Gate 3, intriguing clips spread of the game's stranger possibilities, like a tryst between a vampire and a druid who turned into a bear.
"They completely nerded out on the rules," said Trent Oster, a veteran of the original Baldur's Gate games and the chief executive of Beamdog, a Canadian studio that remastered them for modern systems. "They fell in love with what they were working on, and they went over the top in terms of how much content they put together."
Once Baldur's Gate 3 officially came out on Aug. 3, players began to discover details written for a tiny percentage of players, like a character who persists in annoying patter even beyond death, a transformation into a wheel of cheese, or the stray observations of a ranger and the hamster only he can hear. Others found tricks the developers never anticipated, like changing an antagonist into a sheep so she can later join your party.
With the attention came memes, and impassioned posts on social media. Some players wrote about how the game helped them cope with grief and depression. Others flooded sites with fan art or shared hard-to-find bits of dialogue. CNN published an article about Newbon's vampire.
Samantha Béart, who voiced the character Karlach -- a barbarian on the run with an infernal engine for a heart -- said that people exiting abusive relationships, transgender women finding themselves, veterans confronting P.T.S.D. and people with medical diagnoses all contacted her.
"We continue to be blown away by the cultural and social impact of this game," said Béart, who, like several of the actors, has streamed the game on Twitch.
Sawyer, the studio design director at Obsidian, said he was impressed not only by the companions Larian had created, but by the game's sheer variety of abilities, items and quest resolutions.
But he suspected that many executives would still consider it a huge risk to make a role-playing game as ambitious as Baldur's Gate 3.
"I would love to be proven wrong," he said.

Full text: There was an embarrassment of riches from legacy role-playing franchises, beloved horror series and innovative newcomers.
The return of beloved characters along with ambitious new titles turned this year into one of the video game industry's best, leaving players with an embarrassment of riches.
Even during traditionally sleepy months, players had the opportunity to navigate the galaxies of Starfield, embark on the high-fantasy adventures of Baldur's Gate 3 and battle the monstrous forces of Diablo IV. Long development cycles and a willingness to take risks with gameplay and narrative paid off creatively during what was a grueling season of layoffs, mergers and cutbacks within the industry.
Despite those setbacks, video games remain an innovative sector of culture, with critics giving this year's slate of releases the best review scores in the past 20 years. These games, listed in alphabetical order, excelled at providing players with immersive experiences.
Alan Wake 2
Weirdness should be rewarded, and the Finnish developers at Remedy Entertainment have clearly embraced the edges of what players can expect from a survival horror game. The offbeat style that concerned publishers when the original game released in 2010 returns in this sequel about an author of crime thrillers who keeps treading between fact and fiction, where the lines between reality and illusion blur. Players will find themselves solving murders and dodging bullets, only to later enjoy an extended musical act by a live-action band called the Old Gods of Asgard. (PC, Sony PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)
Baldur's Gate 3
The developers at Larian Studios in Belgium engineered a love letter to the tabletop Dungeons & Dragons series that prioritizes customizability and surprise. The vampires, shape-shifters, dwarves and goblins that populate the world of Baldur's Gate 3 regularly deliver zingers that make every moment of this titanic story a joy to experience. Online multiplayer has also made this game a fan favorite, with dozens of streamers broadcasting their successes and failures to a growing community. (PC, PS5)
Chants of Sennaar
A shrouded figure emerges from a coffin, navigating a series of dungeon puzzles whose instructions are written in a language that players cannot decipher -- yet. Chants of Sennaar, from the French developer Rundisc, is a wonderfully inventive game that plays on the idea of being lost in translation. The cel-shaded artistic direction seems to evoke the Moorish influences of the palace of Alhambra, creating a meditative maze of castles and gardens that hides a darker secret. The disorientation forces players to rely on a pictorial journal where images and words are connected into a makeshift lexicon. Building that dictionary feels like mastering a new language. (Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)
Dave the Diver
Sushi and scuba are only appetizers in this oddball game from the South Korean developer Mintrocket that is set in an oceanside haunt, where a giant octopus is terrifying the local fishermen. That is the first of many mysteries awaiting Dave, an unlikely hero who becomes a seaside MacGyver responsible for running a restaurant and overseeing several farms. He also moonlights as a social media manager, sea horse trainer and underwater archaeologist. (PC, Switch)
Final Fantasy XVI
The flagship franchise of the Japanese developer Square Enix was going through something of an identity crisis -- what exactly defines a Final Fantasy title? -- when the 16th mainline entry arrived. This one takes place in a high-fantasy setting, where kingdoms scheme against one another in a war inspired by the HBO series "Game of Thrones." The resulting epic contains a tragic hero's quest but also mundane side quests spent retrieving wildflowers and other meaningless items. Elements of political intrigue and a subplot involving enslaved magic bearers are eventually overshadowed by an evil god and behemoths known as eikons that lead the protagonist into fights recalling the showdowns between Godzilla and Mothra. But even within its messy later acts, there are shimmers of brilliance found in every Final Fantasy title. (PS5)
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
A direct sequel to Breath of the Wild, one of the most celebrated games of the past decade, created high expectations for Nintendo. The resulting adventure saw the industrial revolution come to Hyrule, where players learned to combine relics scattered across the ruined kingdom into motorcycles and airplanes. Tears of the Kingdom slightly disappointed those craving more narrative depth from the series, but the Japanese team's inventive approach to environmental puzzles remains unparalleled. Trusting players to conquer open-ended challenges with a seemingly infinite number of solutions (and roads to failure) has kept The Legend of Zelda one of the industry's biggest franchises. (Switch)
Pikmin 4
There have been substantial changes to the Pikmin formula in what might be considered a reboot for the Nintendo series, which has struggled to find a mainstream audience. This entry stands out by streamlining mechanics and combining some of the best features of the first three games, which focus on leading armies of Pikmin -- alien plant creatures -- to multiply their numbers, collect treasures and battle local invasive species. All the action happens from the ground level as players navigate a crew of space explorers no larger than ants. (Switch)
Resident Evil 4
When it started revisiting older games in its Resident Evil catalog, the Japanese developer Capcom knew that expectations for one particular entry would be preposterously high. Since its release in the mid-2000s, Resident Evil 4 has been considered by some as one of the greatest video games ever released. The remake is a reminder of why the horror series reigns supreme, bringing new features and unexpected jump scares. A balance of bloody horror and campy jokes from the protagonist, Leon Kennedy, almost softens the sheer terror of zombie villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite chasing you through the countryside of Spain. (PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S)
Spider-Man 2
The developers at Insomniac Games, an American studio, were poised to deliver more of the same after its 2018 game Spider-Man seemed to perfect the gameplay loop of a web-slinging superhero with a realistic map of Manhattan to explore. Players were left to happily swing across the city long after they completed the main story. Its sequel delivered more of the same while improving on some of its predecessor's rough edges. The superhero has extended his jurisdiction to Brooklyn and Queens, more villains are destroying the skyline, and a partnership between Peter Parker and Miles Morales becomes strained as the elder Spidey's mind is corrupted by the alien evildoer Venom. (PS5)
Viewfinder
Playing this game will open your third eye. The puzzles involve perspective-shifting gimmicks that employ trick photography to distort time and space. Developers at the Scottish company Sad Owl Studios have players use a camera to open rifts in the environment, resulting in worlds that sometimes look ripped from an M.C. Escher illustration. Taking some of its ambience and thematic cues from other prestigious puzzlers -- including Portal (2007), The Witness (2016) and Superliminal (2019) -- Viewfinder does not overstay its welcome, leaving players eager to dive farther into its world's many mysteries.

Full text: The role-playing video game based on Dungeons & Dragons won in several categories, including game of the year.
The Game Awards celebrated the technical and artistic achievements of the video game industry on Thursday night, ending with the naming of the role-playing adventure Baldur's Gate 3 as game of the year.
It was the crowning achievement for a game based on Dungeons & Dragons that largely stayed under the radar during its six years in development by the Belgian company Larian Studios. But its summer release -- 23 years after its predecessor -- captivated gamers, who celebrated a robust character creator, deep narrative and branching paths that made it seem as though anything was possible in its fictional universe of vampires and elves.
Baldur's Gate 3, which is available on the PC, the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X|S, also went home with several other awards, including those for best role-playing game, best performance and best multiplayer.
The other nominees for game of the year were Alan Wake 2, by Remedy Entertainment; Marvel's Spider-Man 2, by Insomniac Games; Resident Evil 4, by Capcom; Super Mario Bros. Wonder, by Nintendo; and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, by Nintendo.
The awards show in Los Angeles also served as one long commercial for upcoming games, many of them previously unannounced.
Those titles included Big Walk, by House House, the developers behind the quirky Untitled Goose Game; reboots of classics from Sega, including Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio; an immersive retelling of "Jurassic Park"; and OD, a new horror title from the auteur game designer Hideo Kojima. Skull & Bones, a pirate game from Ubisoft that has been postponed for years, got another release date: Feb. 16.
Hello Games, the developers behind the ambitious planetary explorer No Man's Sky, debuted footage from a new game, Light No Fire, that features open-world versions of Earth that allow multiplayer exploration.
Hollywood celebrities also made appearances, demonstrating how the movie and video game industries are becoming more intertwined. The actors Matthew McConaughey, Timothée Chalamet and Simu Liu and the filmmaker Jordan Peele -- who is working with Kojima -- appeared on the stage to promote games.
"All I can say is that I will have a unique relationship with every player," McConaughey told audiences about the character he will voice for Exodus, an upcoming sci-fi game from Archetype Entertainment.
First presented in 2014, the Game Awards decides on winners through a voting jury of the news media and input from players. On its official YouTube channel, Thursday's show often approached 900,000 simultaneous viewers.
"It has progressively gotten larger and larger," said Alyssa Mercante, a senior editor at the gaming website Kotaku who attended the ceremony. "Essentially it is like the Oscars -- if the Oscars also had movie trailers."
Mercante said the event was a reflection on the successes and struggles of the industry, where men still outnumber women in leadership roles even though some analysts say players are split relatively equally between genders.
Before the event, members of the Game Awards Future Class -- bestowed to young industry professionals -- signed a letter that asked for the ceremony's organizers to comment on the Israel-Hamas war and "express support for the protection of Palestinian human rights." Despite the pressure, the conflict went unmentioned.
Near the end of the ceremony, which extended past three hours, the mind-bending horror mystery Alan Wake 2 won for best game direction. It had previously won awards for best narrative and best art direction.
"Direction is nothing without a team who actually builds it," said Sam Lake, the game's creator. "Believing the same vision and building something out of it, we can make miracles. We can make art. And we can be more than the sum of our parts."

Full text: The new video game about a teenager's journey across the Scottish Highlands is part of an emerging subgenre concerned with the mechanics of movement.
Moira is a teenager on the run when she steps further back into the many layers of grand landscape paintings that make up the mountains, valleys and rivers of A Highland Song. She crosses the video game's Scottish Highlands on her journey to the coast in time for the Gaelic May Day festival Beltane, where her uncle, a lighthouse keeper, is waiting.
A Highland Song, which was released for the PC and the Nintendo Switch this week, is the latest from Inkle, the studio behind the indie darlings 80 Days and Heaven's Vault. In some ways it is the studio's response to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Nintendo's praised open-world game.
"Can you create a 2-D game that creates the same sense of wonder when you look over a landscape that a game like Breath of the Wild does?" asked Joseph Humfrey, the creative director of A Highland Song. "Can you create that same sense of vast scale?"
The term "walking simulator" originated a decade ago as a pejorative to describe slow, nonviolent video games that often explore trauma or grief. But A Highland Song is part of an emerging subgenre that is actually concerned with the mechanics of movement.
Whether through hiking or climbing, games including Sable and Jusant evoke a wanderlust that, as Rebecca Solnit writes in "A History of Walking," "can only be assuaged by the acts of the body itself in motion."
Moira's trek grew from a nostalgia that Humfrey felt for his homeland, but there is more than walking and sightseeing.
"Most of our games aren't one good idea," said Jon Ingold, who founded Inkle with Humfrey and is the narrative director of A Highland Song. "They're two or three good ideas that glue together."
As its narrator promises, A Highland Song's mountains are awash with stories.
During long ascents, cinematic rhythm games incorporate the songs of Mohsen Amini, a nod to Humfrey's and Ingold's appreciation for contemporary Scottish folk music. Moira can go spelunking to cross some paths, pause to skip stones, dally beneath a shady cliff face or waste the whole day at a campfire. There are also abandoned homes and infrastructure, other travelers of questionable corporeality, disembodied voices and, of course, Moira's own thoughts.
Ingold said he took inspiration from Sable, the 2021 indie game that also featured a young protagonist setting off across a large open world on a coming-of-age journey. He credits Sable with doing "introspection without it being too self-indulgent."
Sable had already begun taking shape when Breath of the Wild was revealed, and Sable's creative director, Gregorios Kythreotis, said it provided an opportunity to study another game interested in exploring large spaces.
"It gave us confidence to create a world that just allowed the player to freely explore it," said Kythreotis, half of the two-person studio Shedworks. "To not be afraid of designing moments of quiet into our game."
Games in Breath of the Wild's lineage gesture at the limits of the body through various stamina meters, weather effects and pacing. Others go even further.
In Death Stranding, released by Kojima Productions in 2019, a mailman crossing a postapocalyptic landscape carries precariously large packages on his back. Even small tumbles can bring the character crashing down, enough to make the person behind the controller wince at his pain. Wading in a river forces the player to resist the current and lean into the stream; an unevenly distributed load across bumpy terrain requires concentration to maintain balance.
Death Stranding was a significant reference for the core mechanic in Jusant, where the friction between body and environment was built upon to create a Zen mountainside climb. The player coordinates the character's arms independent of each other as they simultaneously reach for a crevice and support their weight.
"We loved the instant physical connect between the players and the body of the characters," said Kévin Poupard, one of the creative directors of Jusant, which was released by Don't Nod in October.
By demanding focus and technique, these games evoke meditation -- a useful distinction when considering Breath of the Wild's divergent tradition.
Because the point of walking is that we do not really have to think about it. Its usefulness, as Solnit writes, is its nearness to "doing nothing." Our mind wanders through the paths and hills as our body does too. Thought, memory and story all take shape in a form made more concrete.
A Highland Song captures those rhythms, the contemplation of the mind and body, the whims that lead us to the unpredictable and incalculable.
"It comes full circle," Humfrey said. "You go on a walk, and you have a game idea, and you make a game about going for a walk."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the first half of the 20th century, socially conscious artists in the South were great innovators, reflecting on race, progress and the disappearing plantocracy.
Of the many strengths of "Southern/Modern," a daring and revisionist show about the American South at the Georgia Museum of Art in Athens, the one that follows you out to your car is the alternate history of modern art it proposes.
Southern art -- or food or literature, for that matter -- has long suffered a reputation of isolation. "You cant understand it. You would have to be born there," says the tortured Quentin in William Faulkner's "Absalom, Absalom!" Ninety years later, Southern exceptionalism is over (mostly), and the area's artists and curators and chefs now go to great, overcorrective lengths to be global, to be modern. But the artists of Faulkner's day -- they were still responding to an ancient, haunted South. Their audience was stationary, and their language local. They were regionalists. Or so the story goes.
Not here. These 100 or so paintings and prints suggest an invigorating direction that was there all along: a pungent pairing of social history with artistic experiment during the first half of the 20th century. By bringing together professional artists who worked below the Mason-Dixon Line (exempting Florida) between 1913 and 1956, and as far west as Arkansas and Missouri, "Southern/Modern" surveys the riches of a stylistic evolution you will find at, say, the Museum of Modern Art in New York -- the Impressionism that loosened up the 1900s, the Cubism of the 1910s, the Surrealism of the '20s, the modeled social realism of the '30s, the feral abstractions of the '40s and '50s -- as told by a region often buried in the art history books.
Among its big, engrossing canvases by astute social observers like George Biddle (the architect of the New Deal's Federal Artist Project, which gave many of these artists work during the Depression) and Lamar Dodd (a founding father of art education in Georgia), we find a moving imitation of Monet by the Alabama painting teacher and leader of the Dixie Art Colony, John Kelly Fitzpatrick.
The lobes of cyan and mud-green in Fitzpatrick's "Negro Baptising" (1930) jelly into a sunny riverbend. Two parishioners are about to be dunked. In the distance, further stripes of paint indicate hundreds of Black spectators on the bank -- none personalized but each a person. Around them all, a tall bridge traces the inner margins of the canvas, with the piers of the bridge at right and its guard rail running along the top. It's a framing device George Bellows and other urbans employed to remind us where we, the viewers, stand -- that is, outside the action. But in Fitzpatrick's pastoral setting, the bridge illuminates our subject: A maligned community, in other words, will baptize wherever it must, even under the irksome wagon-clack of overhead traffic.
Curated by Martha R. Severens (formerly of the Greenville County Museum of Art in South Carolina) and Jonathan Stuhlman (of the Mint Museum in Charlotte, N.C.), "Southern/Modern" broadcasts the latest trends in the presentation of Southern art, such as you'll find in the richly contextualized American sections of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts or the Georgia Museum's own permanent collection. In this telling, art is a global and porous affair. And far-flung provinces serve as entrepôts to and from the vanguard -- not just detours to be "represented" like Nashville hot chicken in the flavor portfolio of Pringles.
Black artists -- and not just subjects -- share half the stage, for instance. Take Hale Woodruff, a Nashville resident who studied Picasso in 1920s Paris and learned muralism under Diego Rivera in Mexico. Only the Depression could have brought the painter back stateside, reluctantly, where he taught in Georgia and, on a Rosenwald grant for Black students, studied soil degradation.
In "Southland" (1936), one fruit of this labor, Woodruff arranges a rural hillside into a stressful, almost Cubist pyramid: at top are the ruins of an old manor house, at right a wasted shack, with dead stumps and tree trunks lying around. After centuries of enslavement, and now sharecropping, King Cotton had sucked the land dry. But Woodruff renders the actual painted earth in tones of salmon and sherbet -- singing, iridescent hues that negate all the death. It's a Rorschach test: do you see a wasteland, or a vibrant painterly possibility?
By the 1930s, federal initiatives like the Tennessee Valley Authority promised development in the South. For locals, the question became how much new pavement and electricity could be borne by their culture, by their "ma'ams" and "sirs," their gentility, their neighborly warmth. At Vanderbilt University a group of romantic-minded poets, calling themselves the Agrarians, protested "the gospel of Progress" in a 1930 manifesto called "I'll Take My Stand." Robert Penn Warren, aged 25, wrote an essay for the book, suggesting Black people form their own agrarian state -- a defense of segregation he would spend the rest of his life atoning for.
Less famously, visual artists amplified this fear of advancement. See the sterilized surrealism of the Virginian painter Jewett Campbell, where skyscrapers spring from the natural environment. Or the watercolor satire of Homer Ellertson: in his suavely executed "Dean House, Spartanburg, S.C." (circa 1932), a Goodyear service station has set up shop in the front yard of a plantation home. The sepia tone of this work feels retrofuturist, as if we're glimpsing some coming destiny from an even later date.
More than Agrarian conservatism, though, the painters in this show echo what the historian C. Vann Woodward later called the "irony of Southern history": the fact that, as America dominated the global stage from the Monroe Doctrine to World War II, the southeastern quadrant of the country persisted in a long line of self-destructive, embarrassing regressions, from a feudal regime to a secession attempt to an apartheid state.
Hatred of that history seems to have driven the Virginia-born painter Robert Gwathmey to adopt a style somewhere between primitivism and the illustrated wartime poster. In the ropy, segmented outlines and loud, flat colors of his "Sunny South" (1944), an angry piece of agitprop on loan from a private collection, workers hunch wearily with their sacks of cotton in an empty field. At left and right, an old plantation and a modern factory straddle the scene. It is an allegory of pre- and post-Emancipation, with little in visible difference for the working class. At center, the sons and daughters of the Confederacy gather around a statue of their departed hero, Robert E. Lee.
Every exhibition argues something by virtue of its parameters, and the dates at play here remind us that the triumph of American art -- the seminal Armory show of 1913 to the death of Jackson Pollock in 1956 -- took place alongside the rise of civil rights in modern political discourse.
In "When the Klan Passes By" (circa 1939), the Howard University painter James A. Porter uses dark but thin brushloads to convey, through the averted eyes of the Black family in the foreground, the private consequences of race terrorism. (If the dumpy Klan cartoons in Philip Guston's current retrospective deserve a trigger warning, Porter's ice-bath of domestic fear needs a trigger embargo.) Unlike Porter, Gwathmey's allegory of race, with his setting like Monopoly houses, is an imagined, didactic one: His laborers come in all skin tones, arguing that the old plantocracy divided the classes for many years to come, dooming poor whites as well as Blacks.
This is a model exhibition: a targeted provincial study of the innovations we too often associate with Paris and New York. It will be relevant to the many Northern institutions that house these artists (several appear in the Met's current collection show on the Depression, "Art for the Millions"). A few blue-chip artists (Zelda Fitzgerald, Thomas Hart Benton, Jacob Lawrence) fit comfortably among fascinating lesser-knowns. Last fall in Los Angeles, I saw (and loved) a similar survey of Korean art. Now I want one on the Rust Belt, Canada, North Africa, India. What did "modern" mean to the rest of the world?
In January, "Southern/Modern" will travel to Nashville (a city whose controversial gentrification will let these pictures really talk), then to Charlotte and Memphis. But no farther north. Which is a shame, because New York's influence on the South was not only direct and palpable, as the exhibition persuasively argues, but also reciprocal, which the show does less to explore: At Cooper Union in the late '40s, Gwathmey taught the future Pop star Alex Katz. From his new post at New York University in the 1950s, escaping the South once again, Woodruff became a rare Abstract Expressionist of African descent. To the Big Apple, graduates of Black Mountain College, in North Carolina, returned like winged pollinators to a hive. (Representing the Black Mountain contingent here is an early jigsaw-paned composition by one graduate, Elaine de Kooning, and a geometric abstraction by her instructor Josef Albers, a German refugee from fascism.)
The loosey-goosey 1950s close the show, and though Ms. de Kooning is name-brand avant-garde, it was a new abstractionist (new to this reviewer, at least) who really grabbed me. After the war, the printmaker Caroline Durieux, neighbor to Faulkner in New Orleans, sourced isotopes from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, where the uranium was enriched to level Hiroshima. With scientists, Durieux developed radioactive inks that would stay active for 25,000 years.
One of Durieux's electron prints, "Carnival, Circus, or Green Abstraction" (1956), a beguiling centrifugal arrangement of ripples and flakes in hot primary colors, toured Berlin, India and Pakistan in a group show called "The Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy." If that exhibition was some big act of Cold War propaganda, I don't care. It came as welcome relief, after our summer of "Oppenheimer," to find such invention and such buoyancy in yet another Southern darkness.

Black Friday Deals, Spread Across Weeks: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Big discounts, many of them online only, start appearing well before Thanksgiving and will run long after. Some people still go to the mall, though.
Black Friday was once a hallmark celebration of American consumerism. Lately, it has lost some of its thunder.
It's true that shoppers looking for big discounts can still line up early at Macy's or Best Buy on the day after Thanksgiving, in hopes of snagging a bargain. But for many, the bargain has already been had.
Check your inbox: Those emails offering the "Best Prices of the Year" have been coming in for days or weeks as retailers try to beat one another to your wallet.
"When you think about Black Friday, the competitive landscape has really shifted to Black Friday deals prior to Black Friday," Jeffrey Gennette, chief executive of Macy's, told investors on a recent call as he explained why the company was spreading out its promotions. "We're in the midst of that along with our competitors."
That's not to say that Black Friday has lost all meaning. The days when scores of customers camped out at big-box retailers or trampled one another in the rush to get cheap televisions may be gone, but Black Friday is still shorthand for the shopping frenzy that grips Americans this time each year.
"It's still a cultural event, but it's not what it was some years ago," said Craig Johnson, founder of the retail consultanct Customer Growth Partners. "It's nothing like it used to be."
The ease of online shopping has also tamped down Black Friday crowds, but some consumers still prefer the in-person experience.
At a Best Buy in Durham, N.C., a few dozen customers lined up outside the store before dawn on Friday. Nitish Michael, said he and his wife, Smriti, didn't want to commit to any big-ticket purchases. Instead, they bought a few discounted Nintendo Switch video games for their 14-year-old son, Aarit
Nandan Namvuri, 31, and Ydalis Guzman, 27, were in the market for a QLED TV that was discounted by at least 40 percent. Mr. Namvuri said that he'd found such deals online, but that for such an expensive purchase, he wanted to check the pixel resolution himself.
Sydney Hladilek, 21, has been going out for Black Friday deals with her mother for more than a decade. This year, they were looking for a flat-screen television.
"I personally don't like shopping online," Ms. Hladilek said. "I'd rather come in person. Plus, it's a bonding experience."
Here is what you need to know about Black Friday shopping.
How did Black Friday come to be?
The term "Black Friday" was coined around the 1960s by Philadelphia police officers. On the day after Thanksgiving and before the annual Army-Navy football game on Saturday, tourists would storm retailers in the city and the crowds would overwhelm law enforcement.
Retailers embraced the interest but the original meaning was lost on many people -- who came to understand being in the "black" as a reference to profits at retailers (compared with red, which signifies losses).
Over the decades, thanks to retail promotions, it became a fixture on the national calendar, -- eventually defined by long lines, unruly crowds and occasional casualties. As stores sought to compete for shoppers, they extended their hours -- first to the crack of dawn on Friday, then to midnight, then to the night of Thanksgiving.
That trend, facing a backlash from retail workers, began to reverse a few years ago. Many retailers now make a point of staying closed on Thanksgiving. (Employees at some Macy's stores in Washington State used Black Friday to make a statement about their working conditions. More than 400 sales associates went on strike over issues they say they're facing, including theft in stores and low wages.)
In the past 20 or so years, Black Friday sales have also spread internationally, said Dale Rogers, a business professor at Arizona State University. "It started off as a little American thing," he said. "Now it's really global."
Sales now start long before Friday.
Retailers slowly introduced sales earlier, and now deals can be found as early as October, said Mr. Johnson, the retail consultant.
"If you're a retailer, you don't want to capture demand by dropping your prices so low that you don't make money," he said. "The way most people capture demand is by targeting early demand."
Consumers have spent 5 percent more online in the first 20 days of November than they did in the same period last year, according to Adobe Analytics.
Many retailers say that spending on the other end of the holiday shopping calendar, in the days approaching Christmas, is more important as people rush to nab last-minute gifts.
Barnes & Noble, for example, sells more than 20 million books in December alone, with the seven days before Christmas accounting for 20 times the sales of an average week. In 2022, Christmas Eve and the Saturday before Christmas were the busiest days for dollar stores, according to Placer.ai, a market research company.
Mr. Johnson said his firm predicted that Black Friday would be the third-busiest day for retailers this year, behind Dec. 23 and Dec. 16, the last two Saturdays before Christmas.
What are retailers saying about holiday shopping?
Companies have spent much of the past year celebrating a surprisingly resilient consumer who has continued to spend despite inflation and rising interest rates.
But there are signs that that's starting to change. Last quarter, many executives told analysts that shoppers had started pulling back.
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates rapidly starting in March 2022 in an effort to slow down the economy and curb inflation. Though the rate at which prices are rising has eased significantly, the overall increase in prices is starting to weigh on consumers, limiting the amount of discretionary income at their disposal.
"Consumers are feeling the weight of multiple economic pressures, and discretionary retail has borne the brunt of this weight for many quarters now," Christina Hennington, chief growth officer of Target, told analysts on a recent earnings call.
That doesn't necessarily mean consumers won't turn out, but they are more likely to take advantage of promotions and less likely to make big purchases like furniture or certain electronics, analysts expect.
Corie Barry, chief executive of Best Buy, told analysts on an earnings call Tuesday that the company was "preparing for a customer who is very deal focused" and was expecting sales to concentrate on days like Black Friday, Cyber Monday and the days just before Christmas.
The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, forecasts that holiday sales will increase 3 to 4 percent from last year, which is in line with prepandemic levels but not as high as the past two years. Holiday sales rose 5.3 percent in 2022 and 12.7 percent in 2021.
Some stores offered creative deals to draw customers in -- or outside -- the door.
At a Durham location of Swish, a shoe seller based in North Carolina, customers who lined up by 7 a.m. on Friday were entered into a raffle to get certain deals.
Gary Johnson, 44, was among the 14 customers whose names were drawn. He decided to buy a pair of Yeezy Slides, which sold for $ 70. The original price was advertised as $ 200 at the store, though they were available online for around $ 90. Mr. Johnson was aware of the online discounts but said he relished the "experience" of waiting outside."
"Just standing in line is a childhood memory," he said, recalling the times he waited for discounted video games.
At a J.C. Penney down the road, customers snatched up "mystery coupons" that were valued at anywhere from $ 25 to $ 500 at checkout, starting at 5 a.m. At a Palmetto Moon, a Charleston-based clothing company, eager shoppers camped outside to be among the first 50 people in the door and receive a $ 25 gift card to spend on brands like Yeti and Vineyard Vines.

Epic Games C.E.O. Testifies Google Asserts 'De Facto Control' on Android App: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Tim Sweeney, who runs the company that created Fortnite, testified in a case that, if he wins, could allow competing payment systems on the Play Store.
It was a long-awaited day in court for Epic Games' chief executive, Tim Sweeney, who testified in a San Francisco federal courthouse on Monday in the company's legal battle against Google.
The fight between the companies started in summer 2020 when Epic, the company behind the popular video game Fortnite, wanted Google to stop charging app developers a 30 percent fee for purchases made on its Play Store on Android devices.
When Google refused, Epic installed its own payment system in the Fortnite app on Android, charging consumers a lower price.
Google responded by removing Fortnite from its Play Store on Aug. 13, 2020. On the same day, Mr. Sweeney sued Google, accusing the tech giant of asserting monopolistic control over mobile game developers on its Play Store.
"I want to make it clear to everybody exactly what was happening on these platforms," Mr. Sweeney said from a witness stand on Monday. "I want everybody to see and understand Google exercises de facto control over the availability of apps on Android."
In 2021, a federal judge rejected most of Epic's arguments in a similar case against Apple. This time, a nine-person jury will decide whether Google violated antitrust laws by exploiting smaller rivals in a trial that is expected to conclude next month.
The outcome could have wide implications. If Epic wins, Google could be forced to allow other companies to offer competing payment systems on the Play Store.
Since the trial started two weeks ago, Mr. Sweeney has been sitting in the front row of the courtroom almost every day. He was determined to go to trial alone: Google announced a settlement last month with the other plaintiff in this case, Match Group, a dating app company. In September, Google reached a settlement with dozens of state attorneys general who sued the company on similar grounds.
In his testimony, Mr. Sweeney insisted that his goal was to distribute the games to more users, rather than seek monetary damages, and that Google's fee prevented Epic from expanding its business. In a cross-examination, Google's lawyer, Jonathan Kravis, said Epic also paid gaming console companies, including Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft, a 30 percent commission fee and had made $ 12 billion from the consoles together.
Mr. Sweeney nodded to the number, despite saying earlier on Monday that Epic is currently losing money.
Mr. Kravis also pushed Mr. Sweeney on his claim about passing the savings from the fees to customers. For example, Epic is charging the same price for in-game purchases on all platforms, including its own store, where it doesn't pay a fee.
"You are putting the money in your pocket, right?" Mr. Kravis asked.
Mr. Sweeney did not deny the allegation, but he said Epic was saving about 3 percent from not using a payment processor. In testimony later, he also said that a contract with Sony prevented Epic from selling Fortnite's in-game product for less than its price on PlayStation, and that Apple and Microsoft were paid nothing when Epic distributed such products through the companies' personal computers.

Full text: San Francisco jurors convicted David DePape, 43, of federal crimes for breaking into the home of Nancy Pelosi and striking her husband with a hammer.
A jury on Thursday convicted David DePape of federal crimes for breaking into the San Francisco home of Representative Nancy Pelosi and beating her husband with a hammer in an attack that raised fears of political violence ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.
The trial lasted four days, and the jury reached its decision after deliberating for roughly eight hours. Mr. DePape, 43, faces the possibility of decades in prison.
His lawyers did not contest the evidence against him, which included police body camera video of the attack on Paul Pelosi, 83, as well as Mr. DePape's own admissions to the police and on the witness stand. But they argued to the jury that Mr. DePape's bludgeoning of Mr. Pelosi while on a mission to kidnap his wife -- then the speaker of the House and second in line to the presidency -- did not amount to federal crimes.
They said that Mr. DePape did not act on account of Ms. Pelosi's official duties as a member of Congress -- a required element of the charges against him -- but rather as part of a larger plot, fueled by online conspiracy theories, to take down a cabal of so-called liberal elites that he saw as a threat to American liberty.
If the case was never, in the words of one of Mr. DePape's lawyers, "a whodunit," the trial laid bare the ugliness of American politics in an age of extreme polarization.
Mr. DePape, a solitary figure who once lived under a tree in a Berkeley, Calif., park, became obsessed with right-wing conspiracy theories like Pizzagate and QAnon, and seemingly embraced the dehumanizing language about Ms. Pelosi that conservative pundits and politicians had used for years.
In the aftermath of the attack, Republican commentators and elected officials promoted more conspiracy theories about the beating, raising questions about male prostitution or simply suggesting that the official accounts of the attack were not the whole story. And some on the right mocked the beating of an octogenarian in his own home.
At a campaign rally on Saturday in New Hampshire, for example, former President Donald J. Trump called Ms. Pelosi a "crazed lunatic" to a crowd of supporters, and added: "What the hell was going on with her husband? Let's not ask."
In a statement released shortly after the verdict was read in court, a spokesperson for Ms. Pelosi said, "The Pelosi family is very proud of their Pop, who demonstrated extraordinary composure and courage on the night of the attack a year ago and in the courtroom this week. Thankfully, Mr. Pelosi continues to make progress in his recovery."
The attack, in the predawn hours of Oct. 28, 2022, began with Mr. DePape busting through a back door of the Pelosi residence in the upscale Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco. Inside, he discovered Mr. Pelosi asleep in his third-floor bedroom.
Standing in the doorway of the bedroom with a hammer in one hand and zip ties in another, the assailant demanded to see Ms. Pelosi, who was in Washington at the time.
"I recognized I was in serious danger," Mr. Pelosi told the jury on Monday, in his first public comments about the attack. He added, "I tried to stay as calm as possible."
Mr. Pelosi recounted how, with his life in jeopardy, he was able to surreptitiously call 911 from his bathroom and convey that he was in danger without aggravating Mr. DePape. When Mr. DePape said that he would wait for Ms. Pelosi to return to California but that he was tired and needed to sleep, Mr. Pelosi suggested they go downstairs, in the hope that the police were on their way.
"Why don't we go downstairs," Mr. Pelosi recalled saying to Mr. DePape. "And you can tie me up there and we can go to sleep."
Shortly after, the police arrived and found Mr. DePape and Mr. Pelosi standing in the foyer, each with a hand on the hammer. When the officers demanded that they drop the weapon, Mr. DePape seized it, lunged at Mr. Pelosi and bashed him over the head. Prosecutors showed in court a photograph of Mr. Pelosi lying on the ground, a pool of blood gathering around him.
When defense lawyers began their case on Tuesday, the first witness they called was Mr. DePape himself.
Mr. DePape said the catalyst for his online radicalization was Gamergate, an online campaign that began in 2014 as a backlash against female critics of the video game industry. He said he came to Gamergate years later while living in a one-room apartment attached to a garage in Richmond, Calif., that had a fold-up futon, a large chair for playing video games and no bathroom.
Steve Bannon, the former Trump adviser, once tried to harness the community of Gamergate to connect the cadres of isolated, mostly white men to Mr. Trump's political movement. He once told Bloomberg Businessweek, "They come in through Gamergate or whatever and then get turned on to politics and Trump."
Mr. DePape said Gamergate awakened him to the "truth," and from there he became a supporter of Mr. Trump and a skeptic of the mainstream media. And he came to believe in a vast conspiracy theory that liberal elites were promoting pedophilia and spreading lies about Mr. Trump.
He referred to "they" when referencing the conspiracy theory. When asked who "they" were, he responded: "The easiest answer is Wall Street, the super rich and whoever, but there is reason to believe that this traces back to the Jesuits and the Vatican and secret societies and such."
Getting to the heart of their strategy, defense lawyers repeatedly asked Mr. DePape, who was tearful on the stand and apologized for hurting Mr. Pelosi, if he had sought out Ms. Pelosi because of her official congressional duties -- such as whether she supported the Green New Deal or had said something in a floor speech or while meeting with her constituents. No, he said each time.
He targeted Ms. Pelosi, he said, because of her role as a leader of the Democrats, and her media appearances in which she pushed "lies" about Mr. Trump. Mr. DePape said he had planned to wear an inflatable unicorn costume -- he brought two costumes with him on the night of the attack -- while questioning Ms. Pelosi.
When he arrived at the Pelosi residence, Mr. DePape was carrying a sleeping bag and two backpacks stuffed with zip ties, a Nintendo Switch, body cameras, goji berries and $ 9,126 in cash, among other things -- items he said he needed for his planned cross-country trip to hunt down the other targets on his list.
Among them, he said on the witness stand, were Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California; the actor Tom Hanks; Hunter Biden, the son of the president; and George Soros, the hedge fund billionaire.
"He didn't go to that house because of anything she did as speaker of the House," Angela Chuang, a federal public defender and one of Mr. DePape's lawyers, told the jury in her closing argument. "He went there to root out the corruption of the ruling class."
As for Mr. Pelosi, Mr. DePape said he never intended to hurt him, and that the two had developed a "rapport" after the break-in and while Mr. DePape stood in his bedroom wielding a hammer.
"He was a very amiable gentleman," Mr. DePape said. "And I just gave him a squeeze on the shoulder just to be reassuring."
Mr. DePape also faces trial in state court on several felonies, including attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon and elder abuse. The next hearing in that case is scheduled for Nov. 29. But now that Mr. DePape has been convicted in federal court, state prosecutors could seek a plea deal or drop their case entirely, especially if Mr. DePape receives a long prison sentence.
Brooke Jenkins, the district attorney of San Francisco, said in a statement Thursday, "We will confer with the federal prosecutors and with the victim in this case as we determine what our next steps will be."

Full text: What better way to celebrate Halloween season than with a scary (or autumn-themed) video game? The staff from Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times Company, offered options for just about everyone.
Dead Space (2023)
The original Dead Space terrified players with its combination of "Aliens" and "28 Days Later," set within the survival horror gameplay of classics like Resident Evil 4. Remade with modern technology 15 years later, Dead Space (above right) feels even more vital, interesting and fun. ARTHUR GIES
Rated M; play it on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S
Death's Door
In the current era of gigantic open-world games that can take hundreds of hours to beat, I appreciate smaller games that nail their execution. My favorite entry of the past couple years is this action-adventure game, which stars a little crow with a giant sword on a quest to open the titular Death's Door. KIMBER STREAMS
Rated T; play it on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S
Disney Dreamlight Valley
If you want to get spooky and keep things lighthearted, Disney Dreamlight Valley -- one of our favorite cozy games for kids and adults -- is offering a limited-time update in the spirit of Halloween. HALEY PERRY
Rated E; play it on Mac, Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox
The Quarry
This game follows a group of teenage counselors who are alone in the woods on the last night of summer camp, and it plays like a choose-your-own-adventure horror flick. Most of the game is spent in cut scenes with dialogue options that determine how the story will pan out. HALEY PERRY
Rated M; play it on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox
The Room
You're presented with a wooden box that unfolds into a beguiling puzzle. Solving it depends on finding hidden buttons and missing pieces while making sense of each new puzzle box. The game keeps an enjoyable spooky vibe throughout. MAX EDDY

At Goodwill, E-Commerce Is a Key Goal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Goodwill knows it needs to figure out e-commerce. At stake, the nonprofit retailer says, is its ability to generate enough revenue to fulfill its mission: providing job opportunities for those in need.
Since its founding in 1902, Goodwill's locations have been go-to spots for millions of people looking to get rid of their lightly worn clothes and rifle through the racks for other people's stuff. But when it comes to online shopping, Goodwill has a ways to go. For more than a decade, it has faced mounting competition from the likes of ThredUp, Poshmark and Etsy's Depop, online platforms specializing in previously owned clothes.
Goodwill is made up of 154 independently run organizations that have their own chief executives and control the inventory that is donated to stores in their regions. More than 100 of them use an e-commerce auction site called ShopGoodwill.com, which was started in 1999. Other locations have offloaded some of their donations on eBay.
Over the past year, a handful of Goodwills have been contributing to a new online site, GoodwillFinds.
"There's so much competition coming into the market now," Matt Kaness, chief executive of GoodwillFinds eCommerce, said. "So all the donations -- the billions of pounds of donations that Goodwill gets every year -- is now a massive market that for-profit players are targeting."
GoodwillFinds mirrors the look of many other major retailers' sites, with categories like women's and electronics and the ability for shoppers to filter their searches by brand, size and color. It also has unique sections like Heirloom-Quality Finds, and clearance.
When discussing the site, Goodwill executives toss around industry jargon and explain the ways they're improving the customer experience. They have sales targets, want to attract customers with "high lifetime value" and are monitoring the commission structure that could eventually help the website break even.
But Goodwill isn't doing this just because it wants to move into the 21st century. More than 130,000 people work across the organization, while two million people received assistance last year through its programs, which include career navigation and skills training. Those opportunities are funded through the sales of donated items.
Nowadays, people can easily get paid -- by businesses including ThredUp and the RealReal -- to offload their lightly worn T-shirts and designer bags, rather than donate them. While many devotees say it will always be easier to drop off a bag of goods at Goodwill than deal with the online consignors, the increasing competition poses a threat to the nonprofit.
Last year, the total U.S. market for secondhand retail was $ 174.1 billion, lifted by consumers' growing interest in buying sustainable options and finding ways to save money. That's expected to reach $ 258.8 billion by 2027, according to the consultancy firm GlobalData. Analysts note that Goodwill is growing more slowly than its competitors.
"We're kind of playing catch-up," Mr. Kaness said.
The stakes of getting it right are high. Last year, Goodwill helped nearly 180,000 people through its job services.
Ronnie Hunter is one of them. In February, after spending about 20 years in state prison in Illinois, Mr. Hunter returned to Chicago's Englewood neighborhood with the goal of getting a job. He knew about Goodwill stores, but it was a friend who told him that Goodwill also offered a work force development program where he could learn basic computer skills and receive a nice shirt and a tie to wear to interviews.
At first, Mr. Hunter was skeptical that it would be enough to help him overcome the hurdle of securing employment. But after completing a one-week program and then receiving mentorship from a Goodwill worker, he secured a job at a local company that reupholsters seating for transportation companies. He earns about $ 17 an hour.
Mr. Hunter is still in touch with the Goodwill employees who helped him find his footing. "Those employees over there really go the extra mile despite what you did or what you've been through," Mr. Hunter said, adding, "You walk in, it's such a warm feeling."
Continuing to help people like Mr. Hunter makes Goodwill's online strategy even more urgent. But success is far from assured. Major retailers have spent years building teams and pouring money into establishing sophisticated e-commerce operations that involve machine learning and seamless distribution channels.
Goodwill's latest e-commerce venture was in the works for a couple of years. In 2019 and 2020, Goodwill executives commissioned market research to gauge the opportunity they had online.
"It was clear as day that in terms of e-commerce, this was a booming market for resale," said Daryl Campbell, chief executive of Evergreen Goodwill in Washington State and a founding member of GoodwillFinds.
"We recognized that the Goodwill brand needed more of a centralized presence online -- kind of a stand-alone 'here's the Goodwill brand in this space' -- in order for us to be able to compete in this really rapidly growing aggressive market," he added.
Goodwill's decentralized model makes the challenge of gaining an online presence more complicated. In 1999, Goodwill of Orange County in California started Shopgoodwill.com, an auction site. That site still operates with 128 Goodwills contributing and said it had brought in more than $ 2 billion.
GoodwillFinds, which has just 14 members, has sold $ 25 million in merchandise since it started last year and has half a million subscribers, Mr. Kaness said. He said sales growth had increased 50 percent quarter over quarter.
Executives at both Shopgoodwill.com and Goodwillfinds.com said there were currently no plans to merge the sites. On Goodwill's main website, a drop-down option features both for people looking to shop online, with no direction on which one they should choose.
The charity is also contending with a marketing conundrum. Everyone knows Goodwill for one thing. How does it become top of mind when people go online?
"They are the ultimate brand name in thrifting," said Patricia Hambrick, who teaches branding, marketing and sustainability at Boston University's Questrom School of Business. Goodwill, she added, needs shoppers "to get an awareness that they actually have anything online because that's not necessarily where you would think."
As any retailer knows, it's not easy building an e-commerce website that shoppers want to go back to time and again. And one dedicated to resale presents even more hurdles. What Goodwill sells on its site is limited to donations, which are generally countercyclical. In other words, people drop off winter clothes during spring cleaning and give their shorts away just as it's getting cold.
GoodwillFinds has invested time and resources into teaching its participating members strategies for curating merchandise, taking photos and writing descriptions. Recent finds for shoppers included a 14-karat white gold diamond oval ring for about $ 1,900, a pair of red Nike high-tops for $ 46 and a Nintendo 64 for $ 95.
Items ordered off GoodwillFinds are shipped from the contributing member's region, and each distribution center operates a little differently.
"Trying to create a normalized customer experience across that environment has proven to be challenging," said Jim Davis, the chief revenue officer of GoodwillFinds. "The tools we're building out are starting to normalize for us and make it very possible."
But that costs money. Mr. Kaness, who previously was an executive at Walmart and chief executive of ModCloth and Lucky Brands, is well aware that operating a tech venture within a charitable organization is difficult. Many of the well-capitalized, publicly traded online resell sites are not profitable; Mr. Kaness said he thought it would take $ 15 million to $ 25 million of investment to get GoodwillFinds to where it could compete with them.
Outside a Goodwill location near Manhattan's Union Square on a recent afternoon, several shoppers said they were unaware the nonprofit even had a website.
Olivia Klem, 23, who dropped off five bags of donations, said she had learned about the e-commerce site when she went online to search for the nearest Goodwill donation center. She said she might use the site when looking to buy something specific rather than just browsing.
"I like the aspect of going to Goodwill and trying things on and seeing what I can find," Ms. Klem said, holding three tote bags packed with items like wooden spoons and cups she had bought after dropping off her donations.

Goodwill knows it needs to figure out e-commerce. At stake, the nonprofit retailer says, is its ability to generate enough revenue to fulfill its mission: providing job opportunities for those in need.
Since its founding in 1902, Goodwill’s locations have been go-to spots for millions of people looking to get rid of their lightly worn clothes and rifle through the racks for other people’s stuff. But when it comes to online shopping, Goodwill has a way to go. For more than a decade, it has faced mounting competition from the likes of ThredUp, Poshmark and Etsy’s Depop, online platforms specializing in previously owned clothes.
Goodwill is made up of 154 independently run organizations that have their own CEOs and control the inventory that is donated to stores in their regions. More than 100 of them use an auction site called ShopGoodwill.com that was started in 1999. Other locations have sold some of their donations on eBay.
Over the past year, a handful of Goodwills have been contributing to a new online site, GoodwillFinds.
“There’s so much competition coming into the market now,” said Matt Kaness, CEO of GoodwillFinds eCommerce. “So all the donations — the billions of pounds of donations that Goodwill gets every year — is now a massive market that for-profit players are targeting.”
GoodwillFinds mirrors the look of many other major retailers’ sites, with categories such as women’s goods and electronics and the ability for shoppers to filter their searches by brand, size and color. It also has sections such as Heirloom-Quality Finds and clearance.
When discussing the site, Goodwill executives toss around industry jargon and explain the ways they’re improving the customer experience. They have sales targets, want to attract customers with “high lifetime value” and are monitoring the commission structure that could eventually help the website break even.
But Goodwill isn’t doing this just because it wants to move into the 21st century. More than 130,000 people work across the organization, while 2 million people received assistance last year through its programs, which include career navigation and skills training. Those opportunities are funded through the sales of donated items.
Nowadays, people can easily get paid — by businesses including ThredUp and the RealReal — to offload their T-shirts and designer bags, rather than donate them. While many devotees say it will always be easier to drop off a bag of goods at Goodwill than deal with the online consignors, the increasing competition poses a threat to the nonprofit.
Last year, the total U.S. market for secondhand retail was $174.1 billion, lifted by consumers’ growing interest in buying sustainable options and finding ways to save money. That’s expected to reach $258.8 billion by 2027, according to consulting firm GlobalData. Analysts note that Goodwill is growing more slowly than its competitors.
“We’re kind of playing catch-up,” Kaness said.
The stakes of getting it right are high. Last year, Goodwill helped nearly 180,000 people through its job services.
Ronnie Hunter is one of them. In February, after spending about 20 years in state prison in Illinois, Hunter returned to Chicago’s Englewood neighborhood with the goal of getting a job. He knew about Goodwill stores, but it was a friend who told him that Goodwill also offered a workforce development program where he could learn basic computer skills and receive a nice shirt and a tie to wear to interviews.
At first, Hunter was skeptical that it would be enough to help him overcome the hurdle of securing employment. But after completing a one-week program and then receiving mentorship from a Goodwill worker, he secured a job at a local company that reupholsters seating for transportation companies. He earns about $17 an hour.
Hunter is still in touch with the Goodwill employees who helped him find his footing. “Those employees over there really go the extra mile despite what you did or what you’ve been through,” Hunter said, adding, “You walk in, it’s such a warm feeling.”
Continuing to help people like Hunter makes Goodwill’s online strategy even more urgent. But success is far from assured. Major retailers have spent years building teams and pouring money into establishing sophisticated e-commerce operations that involve machine learning and seamless distribution channels.
Goodwill’s latest e-commerce venture was in the works for a couple of years. In 2019 and 2020, Goodwill executives commissioned market research to gauge the opportunity they had online.
“It was clear as day that in terms of e-commerce, this was a booming market for resale,” said Daryl Campbell, CEO of Evergreen Goodwill in Washington state and a founding member of GoodwillFinds.
“We recognized that the Goodwill brand needed more of a centralized presence online — kind of a stand-alone ‘here’s the Goodwill brand in this space’ — in order for us to be able to compete in this really rapidly growing aggressive market,” he added.
Goodwill’s decentralized model makes the challenge of gaining an online presence more complicated. In 1999, Goodwill of Orange County in California started Shopgoodwill.com, the auction site. It still operates with 128 Goodwills contributing and said it had brought in more than $2 billion.
GoodwillFinds, which has just 14 members, has sold $25 million in merchandise since it started last year and has 500,000 subscribers, Kaness said. He said sales growth had increased 50% quarter over quarter.
Executives at both Shopgoodwill.com and Goodwillfinds.com said there were no plans to merge the sites. On Goodwill’s main website, a drop-down option features both, with no direction on which people should choose.

Full text: Curators and conservators are working to save -- and update -- art made with aging hardware.
UP A BUCKLING flight of stairs on Murray Street in Lower Manhattan, the dusty workshop of CTL Electronics is crammed with once-novel relics: cathode-ray tube (CRT) televisions, three-beam projectors and laserdisc players from the previous century. Hundreds of outdated monitors are arranged beside money trees and waving maneki neko cats, an installation in a kind of mini-museum run by CTL's proprietor, Chi-Tien Lui, who has worked as a TV and radio repairman since immigrating from Taiwan in 1961. At CTL, which he opened in 1968, Lui initially sold closed-circuit TV systems and video equipment, but for the past couple of decades, his business has had a unique focus: repairing video artworks that, since the onset of the digital age, are increasingly likely to malfunction and decay.
Many of CTL's clients are museums looking to restore works by a single artist, the video art pioneer Nam June Paik, who died in 2006. Known for his sculptures and room-size installations of flickering CRT monitors, Paik began visiting the shop in the 1970s on breaks from his studio in nearby SoHo. While some conservators have updated his work by replacing old tubes with LCD screens, Lui is one of the only technicians who can rebuild Paik's sets from spare parts, as if they were new.
Paik's work was on view, along with video works from dozens of other artists, in "Signals," a sweeping exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York earlier this year. Many pieces in the show, such as those in the video collectives section, played on boxy Sony CRT monitors, long favored by artists for their austere, stackable design, and which stopped being produced in the 2000s. The cube CRTs are essentially worthless to consumers, but museums are willing to pay a premium for them on eBay -- "if you can even get your hands on one," said Stuart Comer, the chief curator of media and performance at MoMA, who helped organize the show. "I had to tell security, 'Pretend these are Donald Judds,' because they're basically priceless at this point."
It's an ongoing dilemma for the modern-art institution: New technologies are only ever new for so long. When the phaseout of the incandescent light bulb, a go-to material for artists from Robert Rauschenberg to Felix Gonzalez-Torres, began in 2012, museums either amassed stockpiles of the old bulbs or found a reliable supplier. Dan Flavin, who spent his entire career working with fluorescent light, always had his preferred manufacturers. Last year, the Biden administration proposed as part of its climate policy a sunsetting of compact fluorescents, and a few states have recently enacted legislation that in the coming years will also ban the longer tube lights that Flavin used. For now, museums continue to go through the estate of the artist, who died in 1996, to replace burned-out lights. Not all artists are so precious about their materials, however: In 2012, when Diana Thater presented her 1992 video installation "Oo Fifi, Five Days in Claude Monet's Garden" at the Los Angeles gallery 1301PE, where it had first been shown 20 years earlier, she updated its clunky CRT projectors to digital ones. She digitized the video, a collage of film footage from Monet's garden in Giverny, France -- itself a technological update of the Impressionist painter's vistas in oil -- because, she said, "I don't want my work to look fake old." Paik, for his part, left behind a page of instructions specifying that his works could be updated, as long as the integrity of the original look of the sculpture was respected, to the best of what the technology would allow.
In conserving works made with more mundane materials, museums generally rely on an artist like Thater or on the artist's estate to provide guidance -- or even the materials themselves, as is the case with Flavin. But technology now moves at a much faster pace. A museum's task of protecting art in perpetuity has remained fixed, even as artists' materials have changed. Art institutions are likely the only places in the world that are currently planning how they might be able to fix an Oculus Rift 50 years from now. Rather than keep stockpiles of expensive and obsolete technology in storage, museums have to find clever ways around software updates, from video game emulators to server farms to niche businesses like CTL. But they, too, have a life span as short as, or shorter than, those of light bulbs. There are far more obscure materials for artists to choose from than ever before.
GLENN WHARTON WAS hired in 2007 as MoMA's first conservator of time-based media, or works that often depend on commercial technology that can have a limited shelf life. "I saw the writing on the wall that it was hard to even buy videotapes anymore," Wharton said. In the early days, he was making decisions "about changing the works of art" that were the equivalent of a painting conservator using acrylic instead of oil paint: "We were swapping out CRTs and sometimes moving toward flat-screen technology, or changing projectors or even digitizing." Ultimately, Wharton decided, "defining the authentic state of a work of art is central to what conservators do." So when the museum acquired a work dependent on a specific technology from a living artist, he'd ask how they wanted it to be conserved and displayed.
Wharton now runs a program at U.C.L.A. that has helped to clarify one of the main issues in the emerging field of digital conservation: digital obsolescence. If certain art is dependent on an extinct technology, how does one preserve the art so that it outlasts the technology itself? Sometimes by addressing a phenomenon called bit rot: As Caroline Gil, the director of media collections and preservation at the New York nonprofit Electronic Arts Intermix, explained, "Digital files of all stripes are made up of data -- zeros and ones -- and, every so often, a zero can turn into a one through electrostatic discharge in your hard drive or in a big server farm. That corrupts the file." There are methods for fixing this, she said, "but that's a very niche level of understanding, and I don't think a lot of archives or collecting institutions do that, really."
Coding expertise is still uncommon in museum conservation departments, but that may have to change. "The art world is kind of running on an old operating system of Modernism," said Cass Fino-Radin, a conservator and founder of the upstate New York firm Small Data Industries, even as museums are collecting newer artworks that, at their core, are composed of code. In 2016, the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York contacted Fino-Radin for help with a two-year-long assessment of digital materials in its permanent collection. The project included a detailed case study of a defunct iOS app called Planetary, acquired by the museum in 2013, which allowed users to browse a music library like astronauts soaring through the Milky Way. Debuting in 2011, Planetary had been rendered incompatible with iOS software updates within a few years, so the museum decided to share the source code on GitHub for anyone to try to fix it. Ultimately, it was an Australian developer, Kemal Enver, who got it functioning again, releasing it in 2020 as Planetary Remastered. To Fino-Radin, it was a warning sign: "For museums, hiring a professional software developer to do that kind of annual maintenance isn't something that's ever been remotely needed in history, and so institutions just don't have the money to do it. It's a new line item in their budgets."
For works dependent on old hardware, conservators sometimes rely on a method known as emulation: "You're fooling a current computer into thinking that it's running on an older system, meaning I can turn my MacBook Pro into a virtual machine where I can run a net art piece in a Netscape 1.1 browser," said Christiane Paul, the curator of digital art at the Whitney Museum of American Art. This approach was adopted at Rhizome, a New York nonprofit dedicated to promoting and preserving digital art, which in 2012 presented (along with the New Museum of Contemporary Art) an online exhibition of interactive computer games for preteen girls co-created by Theresa Duncan that had first been released on CD-ROM in the mid-1990s. Visitors to the Rhizome website can play Chop Suey, a delirious adventure through a small Ohio town, by connecting virtually to a server running the game on its 1995 software.
Many artists don't think about what will happen to their work when they are gone. Or they never imagined certain pieces having much of a future. In "Super Mario Clouds" (2002), an early video installation by the artist Cory Arcangel, the 1985 Super Mario Bros. video game plays off a Nintendo console with all of the game's animated features, apart from sky and clouds, erased. Obsolescence was partly the point of the work because, as a then-unknown artist, Arcangel didn't expect to be showing it 20 years later -- and by 2002 the consoles "were considered trash," he said. An edition of "Super Mario Clouds" was bought by the Whitney, whose conservators were aware that the console might not function much longer. But the source code remains available, and Arcangel has granted the museum permission to use a Nintendo emulator to show the work.
Yet is an emulated artwork, even if indistinguishable from the original, really the same artwork? This riddle is sometimes known as the paradox of Theseus's ship: According to Plutarch's legend, as the Athenians preserved their former king's boat through the decades by gradually replacing its decaying old planks with new ones, philosophers wondered, could the ship still be considered authentic if none of its original parts remained?
The conundrum is why some artists and conservators have now incorporated outwitting obsolescence into their practices. Lynn Hershman Leeson, an 82-year-old artist who was a contemporary of Paik's, has been working with A.I. technology since the late 1990s and in 1983 made one of the first interactive video art pieces: "Lorna," created originally for a groundbreaking new technology called laserdisc. Twenty years later, she upgraded to another now-bygone technology -- the DVD. Lately, she's been experimenting with a futuristic method of archiving her work. Looking to preserve a series of videos and documents from her research on genetic manipulation and synthetic biology, she turned to a technology at once far older and more cutting-edge than anything else on the market: DNA. Hershman Leeson first converted her research into a video timeline on Final Cut Pro, and then enlisted Twist Bioscience in San Francisco, which manufactures DNA products, to chemically synthesize it into a sequence. The resulting genetic material is kept in two vials in her studio, as well as in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany. "DNA has a 500-year half-life," she said. "I also saw it as a metaphor, a poetic conclusion to all of this work, to create something that's relatively invisible and holds our past and our future."
The problem is, neither Hershman Leeson nor the museums that collect her work are able to retrieve it from the sequence. In theory, the process is reversible, but it's also expensive and time-consuming. At least for now, the work belongs to the future.

Mario Can't Be Super Without Psychedelic Power-Ups: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Mario Can't Be Super Without Psychedelic Power-Ups
Early into his newest adventure, Mario transforms into a large elephant.
It's not a costume like those in previous Super Mario video games, where acrobatics are imbued in the cat suits, penguin wings and frog legs worn by the Mushroom Kingdom's savior. Instead, the fictional plumber gains hooves and quadruples in size. His signature overalls stretch to accommodate his leathery largess faster than he can shout "Wowie! Zowie!"
That peculiar power-up, which lets Mario use his trunk to swat enemies and water benevolent flowers, is just one spectacle in the eccentric Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which arrives Friday for the Nintendo Switch.
But by turning its star into an elephant, Nintendo is also acknowledging a simple fact of its Goomba-stomping, Koopa-kicking empire: Mario himself is a little boring. The smorgasbord of power-ups is what keeps players excited.
Mario's greatest natural ability is high jumping. And his motivation has been the same for decades, usually involving his need to rescue Princess Peach from the evil King Bowser. But the stakes are ultimately low, with heroes and villains who come together elsewhere for party games and go-kart antics.
"It's not like we were setting out to create a hero," said Takashi Tezuka, a longtime executive producer at Nintendo who helped design 1985's Super Mario Bros. alongside the franchise's creator, Shigeru Miyamoto. "We are also very lucky that he is someone that people view as being approachable."
But there is a difference between approachable and exciting. Other protagonists on Nintendo's roster wield magical swords and shoot lasers from their spacesuits. There is a pink puffball with the ability to inhale objects as large as semi trucks and an intrepid explorer commanding an army of sentient plants.
Despite his average stature, Mario has become the company's Mickey Mouse, complete with his own amusement parks and an animated movie that has grossed more than $ 1.3 billion. Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the franchise's first classic side-scroller in more than a decade, arrives shortly after Nintendo announced its intent to become an entertainment company with video gaming as the nucleus.
In the 1983 arcade game Mario Bros., Mario could avoid enemies only by running and jumping. But two years later, in Super Mario Bros., he was chowing down mushrooms that increase his size, flowers that allow him to throw fireballs and stars that grant temporary invincibility. Mastering those abilities to traverse increasingly difficult levels is part of what attracted players to the franchise.
A more oddball approach came with the 1990 arrival of Super Mario Bros. 3 for the Nintendo Entertainment System: Mario could fly using a raccoon-like tanooki suit, or squeeze inside a giant boot to hop across spiky obstacles. By the time New Super Mario Bros. arrived for the Nintendo DS in 2006, developers appeared satisfied with refining older concepts, including mushrooms that could shrink and supersize the plumber.
Now there's Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which turns the franchise into a carnival of bizarre delights. Each level includes a wonder flower, a new mechanic that sends Mario on something like a psychedelic trip, reconfiguring the world around him -- warp pipes start crawling like caterpillars, rhinos begin a stampede and some mountains gain a set of googly eyes.
Nintendo did not arrive at the concept of the wonder flower until about halfway through the game's decade-long development period, sending the team scrambling for ideas. There were regular meetings called "wonder consideration time" and a list of nearly 2,000 ideas generated from the game's staff.
"It was a lot of work," said Shiro Mouri, the game's director. "Out of those ideas, we whittled them down to potentials and prototyping. Then we got into the nitty-gritty details to make them wonders."
Nintendo has a management group that helps keep track of nearly four decades of Mario power-ups. One of the challenges in Super Mario Bros. Wonder's development process was encouraging younger employees to experiment.
"Among staffers there were thoughts of not changing key elements," Tezuka said. "At the very beginning, I reached out and said: 'That is not true. Don't be restricted."'
Some of the new power-ups for Super Mario Bros. Wonder allow the plumber to capture enemies in bubbles and drill into the ground. The abilities help polish a character who is having a shining moment: More than 168 million people watched "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," and Nintendo has recently announced remakes of fan favorites like Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.
The development team behind Super Mario Bros. Wonder hopes it can ride that wave of interest while reintroducing the classic Mario formula to a new generation.
"We do still have some heart palpitations," Tezuka said, "thinking about whether people in the real world will get the same enjoyment that we intend them to have."

Gamers Are Warming to a Merger: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: They could save money if Activision's titles are added to Xbox Game Pass, a monthly subscription service. But some are reserving judgment.
When Microsoft announced that it was spending $ 69 billion to buy the video game maker Activision Blizzard in January last year, Justin Kats was stunned.
To Mr. Kats, a 34-year-old former professional video game player from Lansing, Ill., it was a seismic event that allowed Microsoft to claim victory over Sony in the console business by obtaining Activision's slate of popular games, like Call of Duty.
"I thought there was no way -- this can't be," he said. "Console wars are over? Xbox wins?" Mr. Kats, who now streams video games recreationally on Twitch under the name FearItSelf for Evil Geniuses, a professional gaming organization, worried that Microsoft, which makes the Xbox, would take Call of Duty away from people who played on Sony's PlayStation consoles.
But over the past year, Mr. Kats has been heartened by Microsoft's plans to keep Call of Duty available on PlayStation, and by its agreements to offer the game to Nintendo's Switch and other platforms. With the deal finally closing Friday after a global regulatory battle, Mr. Kats, like many other gamers, is now cautiously optimistic about Microsoft's assuming control of one of the gaming industry's biggest publishers.
"There's a lot of energy and hype and attention," Mr. Kats said, "but with that comes skepticism, and expectations are a lot higher because you spent all this money."
The process of securing regulatory approvals for a corporate merger is often a dull slog, watched only by the keenest business and antitrust enthusiasts. Not so with Microsoft's Activision deal, which has captured the attention of millions of video game enthusiasts.
Gamers inundated a British regulatory agency with more than 2,000 public comments, spent countless hours on YouTube watching legal analysis of government attempts to block the deal and packed the Zoom audience for a hearing in federal court about the acquisition in June.
Three-quarters of those who emailed the British agency said they were eager to see Microsoft complete its deal. Many were convinced that the transaction would buoy Activision's game development and give players access to premium games for a cheaper price through Microsoft's monthly subscription.
Gamers have also expressed hope that Activision, which was accused in a 2021 lawsuit of having a sexist workplace culture, will improve its treatment of employees under Microsoft's ownership. Some PlayStation gamers who fear their platform's quality will now lag behind Xbox's, however, remain worried.
The acquisition was one of the most dramatic developments in the history of the video game console wars, a long-running feud between PlayStation and Xbox players that is akin to interactions between fans of rival sports teams.
Gamers are notoriously opinionated, and they have weighed in on aspects of the deal ranging from the future of Bobby Kotick, Activision's chief executive, to the Federal Trade Commission's struggles to understand the gaming industry as it took Microsoft to court in an attempt to block the transaction.
Gamers' interest in the transaction has been so strong that it repeatedly came up in federal court. A Microsoft lawyer, Beth Wilkinson, suggested that the company could not afford the reputational blow if it reneged on promises to keep Call of Duty available on PlayStation.
"They couldn't face the wrath from the gamers," she testified.
In recent years, Microsoft has tried to improve its image with gamers, positioning itself as unconcerned about competing with Sony and more focused on removing barriers to playing games by offering low-cost products like Xbox Game Pass, the $ 11-a-month subscription.
It has said its acquisition of Activision is good for the industry, though government regulators like the F.T.C. argued that the purchase was anticompetitive, and some of Microsoft's private communications that were revealed in court showed the tech giant was more interested in battling Sony by keeping games exclusive to its Xbox ecosystem than it had let on.
On Friday, Microsoft said the deal's closure would instead increase access to Activision's games.
"We believe our news today will unlock a world of possibilities for more ways to play," Phil Spencer, the chief executive of Microsoft Gaming, wrote in a blog post.
Many gamers trust that Microsoft will keep its word, and think the deal will be good for the industry. Ross Varner, an information technology consultant in Houston, said he and other gamers he knew thought Microsoft was likely to improve Activision's corporate culture while also giving the developer the freedom and time needed to produce quality games.
"Because Activision has basically just been a Call of Duty machine for the last several years, they're hopeful that Microsoft will have them go back to franchises they haven't touched in a long time," said Mr. Varner, 35, who plays on both an Xbox and a PlayStation.
Sony, which declined to comment on the deal's closure, had opposed the Activision deal, concerned that Microsoft could remove Call of Duty from PlayStation or otherwise degrade the game on its platforms, even though Microsoft has said it will not. After the F.T.C.'s efforts to stop the deal fizzled out in July, Sony agreed to a 10-year contract with Microsoft to keep the game on PlayStation. But PlayStation loyalists are still nervous.
"It's making me feel like I need to switch to a whole different ecosystem in order to play the games that I was already playing," said Johnathan Schoepf, a human resources specialist in Cincinnati who is primarily a PlayStation gamer.
Mr. Schoepf, 25, said he expected that future Activision games would be exclusive to Xbox, just as new games from Bethesda -- a developer that Microsoft acquired in 2020 -- have been.
"It's a little bit like we've been stabbed in the back," he said. "Microsoft has come and consolidated a huge part of the industry, two of the major publishing studios, and now is restricting their output on rival consoles."
Mr. Kats, the former professional gamer, said he was optimistic, but was reserving judgment until he saw exactly how Microsoft handled the development of future iterations of key franchises like Call of Duty.
"The grass isn't always greener just because another tech giant has taken over the reins," he said.

How Microsoft Turned the Tide in Its Regulatory Fight Over Activision: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company found a way to placate three of the most powerful regulatory bodies in the world, along with a federal judge in San Francisco.
The first call that Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, made in early 2022 after his company announced a $ 69 billion deal to buy the video game publisher Activision Blizzard was to Kenichiro Yoshida, the chief executive of Sony.
Activision made the blockbuster video game Call of Duty, and Sony made the PlayStation game console, which competed with Microsoft's Xbox. Mr. Nadella knew Sony would be worried that Microsoft might yank Activision's games from PlayStation.
"I just wanted to make it very, very clear to Yoshida-san, who's someone I have a fantastic relationship with, that there should be no ambiguity in our support for the Sony platform going forward," Mr. Nadella would later testify in court.
The call was a linchpin of Microsoft's legal strategy to overcome immense government scrutiny of the largest consumer tech deal in decades. To complete the deal, Microsoft needed to mollify three of the most powerful and skeptical regulators in the world: the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the European Commission in Brussels and Britain's Competition and Markets Authority.
Microsoft slowly flipped competitors into allies, signing private deals to pre-empt concerns that it anticipated from regulators. When diplomacy didn't work, it made a substantial concession and used expansive legal resources to grind the government agencies down.
The strategy worked. European regulators turned the private arrangements with rivals into a formal settlement. A judge in the United States repeatedly cited those side deals to let the acquisition proceed over the F.T.C.'s objections. And after initially opposing the deal, the British regulator reopened talks with Microsoft after the company made concessions to limit its control over game streaming, getting formal approval on Friday. That same day -- almost 21 months after it was initially announced to the public -- Microsoft closed the deal.
A Microsoft executive said the closing of the deal signaled a "good day to play" and Activision's chief executive called it a "milestone" for the company. A spokeswoman for the Federal Trade Commission, Victoria Graham, said the agency would continue with its challenge to the deal even though it has closed. Sony declined to comment.
Microsoft leaned on an expansive lobbying and legal operation developed after its yearslong antitrust battle in the 1990s. Under Brad Smith, the company's president and de facto head of government relations, Microsoft has built deep relationships in Washington and painted itself as a responsible corporate citizen that has shed its bellicose reputation.
It has not gone perfectly to plan. Microsoft's charm offensive failed to sway Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, who has led the commission to take a more muscular stance toward the power of tech's biggest companies. The agency challenged the deal in administrative court and then asked a federal court to stop its closing, but ultimately failed. The F.T.C. has appealed the federal court's ruling.
Several senators also asked the F.T.C. to examine the acquisition's impact on workers, a topic that Ms. Khan had taken interest in. Microsoft brokered an agreement to remain neutral in a unionization campaign by the Communications Workers of America, which initially opposed the deal.
The labor union began advocating on Microsoft's behalf, directly appealing to Ms. Khan, but her focus on consumer issues prevailed. The neutrality deal remains, even though the political benefit fizzled.
And for more than half a year, Microsoft tried to woo Sony, with talks running off and on until late August, when the head of Microsoft's gaming division, Phil Spencer, emailed a Sony executive, Jim Ryan, with a list of games that Microsoft would guarantee could remain on PlayStation.
"It was not a meaningful list," Mr. Ryan later testified, explaining that "for example, Overwatch is on there, but Overwatch 2 is not on there, the current version of the game."
Just as regulators were moving into more intense phases of review, any hope of an alliance with Sony petered out. So Microsoft turned to the other big console maker, Nintendo, whose immensely popular Switch device competes with Xbox and PlayStation.
Sarah Bond, an Xbox executive, testified that she had initially emailed the president of Nintendo's North American division, Doug Bowser, hours after the deal was announced. But it was only in December that Microsoft announced an agreement to offer Call of Duty to Nintendo's Switch. The F.T.C. wasn't swayed, and soon sued to block the deal in its administrative court.
The F.T.C.'s suit pushed Microsoft to sign contracts that cemented its informal promises to rivals, Ms. Bond testified. "We wanted to make it absolutely clear that we would do it, and we wanted to make a legally binding commitment to demonstrate that," she said.
Microsoft announced several of those deals with game streaming partners at a news conference in Brussels. In May, the European Union blessed the acquisition, on the condition that Microsoft keep up those streaming agreements. But the British regulator still moved to block the deal in late April, saying it was worried that Microsoft would dominate the nascent game streaming industry. To many, it looked like the deal could collapse.
Microsoft turned to an increasingly popular tactic for corporate lawyers trying to defeat regulators. While trying to get mergers approved, companies frequently promise regulators that they won't engage in certain anticompetitive behavior, or they offer to spin off part of their operations. Regulators are increasingly rejecting those promises as inadequate and challenging mergers in court instead.
But companies have found success in defeating those court challenges by, effectively, getting a judge to agree that their promises to regulators should have been enough. In antitrust circles, the tactic is known as "litigating the fix." Microsoft had its fix: the contracts it had reached with its rivals promising access to Call of Duty.
But it needed to get in front of a judge.
The F.T.C.'s suit in its internal court had been scheduled for trial on Aug. 8. But Microsoft was confident it could win if it made its case directly to a federal judge -- something that would put pressure on the F.T.C. to drop its entire challenge before the deadline to close the deal by mid-July.
In early June, the F.T.C. emailed Microsoft, asking if the company would commit to not closing the deal until it resolved the issues in Britain, according to a person familiar with the correspondence. Microsoft said it couldn't promise that. Quickly, the F.T.C. sued Microsoft in federal court, saying an order from the court to stop the deal from closing was "necessary because Microsoft and Activision have represented that they may consummate the proposed acquisition at any time."
Ten days later, Microsoft had the federal trial it wanted.
The F.T.C. argued during a federal hearing in June that the agreements Microsoft had signed were confusing and rushed, and that the judge should not factor them into her consideration.
But Microsoft's gamble worked.
The judge, Jacqueline Scott Corley, ruled in Microsoft's favor, saying she was persuaded in part by the company's offer of Call of Duty to other platforms. In her decision, she wrote that Microsoft "will probably not have an incentive to breach these agreements."
Judge Corley also noted that Microsoft's strategy had resulted in concessions that would benefit consumers.
"That scrutiny has paid off: Microsoft has committed in writing, in public and in court to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for 10 years on parity with Xbox," Judge Corley wrote. "It made an agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to Switch. And it entered several agreements to for the first time bring Activision's content to several cloud gaming services."
In a rare move, the British regulator then said it was reconsidering its opposition because Microsoft seemed willing to make new concessions. Microsoft formally submitted a new plan: It would transfer the streaming rights to license all current and future Activision games to Ubisoft Entertainment, a rival game publisher.
The arrangement, which would last for 15 years everywhere outside of the European Union, means Microsoft would not have the power to unilaterally make Activision's games available exclusively on its own streaming service.
Almost two months after reviewing the revised plan, the British regulator gave Microsoft its final blessing. The company closed the deal hours later.

Microsoft Gets Merger at Last With Activision: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The megadeal could strengthen Microsoft's standing in the video game industry, after a year and a half of negotiations with regulators around the world.
Microsoft said on Friday that it had closed its $ 69 billion purchase of the video game giant Activision Blizzard, overcoming significant regulatory hurdles in Britain and the United States and signaling that the tech industry's giants are still free to use their cash hoards to get even bigger.
The deal, the largest consumer tech acquisition since AOL bought Time Warner more than two decades ago, won approval from British regulators on Friday, the last remaining regulatory obstacle.
The completion of Microsoft's Activision acquisition is a clear signal that several years of governments around the world scrutinizing big tech companies have so far done little to curb their power, their growth or their ability to ink megadeals. And the deal could provide a blueprint for other big tech companies on how to successfully fend off the intervention of regulators.
Microsoft overcame roadblocks in multiple countries from government officials who said the merger would dampen competition in the video game industry.
Their challenges were part of a larger effort by governments around the world to take action against tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta, which owns Facebook. The Federal Trade Commission tried to stop Meta from buying a start-up that makes a virtual reality fitness game. The Justice Department last year sued to stop a deal for a health tech company that it said would give one of the nation's largest insurers data about its competitors.
But both of those challenges were unsuccessful. Although regulators have succeeded in blocking or forcing companies to abandon some deals -- including in publishing, aerospace and semiconductor manufacturing -- they have yet to score a major victory against one of the giant digital platforms that dominate online commerce.
Regulators are nonetheless pushing ahead with cases against tech companies. The Justice Department is in the middle of a trial against Google, arguing that the company abused its power as a monopoly over online search. The F.T.C. is pursuing a monopoly lawsuit of its own against Meta, arguing that the company used the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp to stamp out future competitors. In September, it sued Amazon, saying the company had hindered competition when it squeezed merchants and favored its own services.
Microsoft navigated a tricky process for its megadeal that included securing approval from dozens of countries. It agreed to offer continued access to one of Activision's flagship franchises, Call of Duty, on game platforms from other companies like Nintendo and Sony.
In April, Britain's regulatory agency, the Competition and Markets Authority, dealt the deal a significant blow by blocking its approval in Britain. But the regulator reversed its decision after Microsoft agreed to license to a rival a part of Activision's business associated with so-called cloud gaming, a small but promising new area for the industry.
The F.T.C. unsuccessfully sought a preliminary injunction against Microsoft in the United States, which would have delayed the deal's closing and potentially doomed it to a drawn-out legal appeals process. The agency has appealed that ruling, but the deal was able to close while that legal process plays out.
Phil Spencer, the chief executive of Microsoft Gaming, celebrated the deal's closure in a blog post Friday, nodding to the concerns from rivals and regulators about players without an Xbox losing access to Activision's games.
"Whether you play on Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, PC or mobile, you are welcome here -- and will remain welcome, even if Xbox isn't where you play your favorite franchise," he wrote.
Microsoft has not fully satisfied regulators, and it is taking a calculated risk that it will not be forced to unwind the acquisition years down the line. An F.T.C. case against the combination is still pending in its administrative court, in a process that can take years to resolve.
If the F.T.C. prevails there, Microsoft can eventually appeal to almost any federal court of its choosing. That means it could take the case to the same court that already ruled in its favor in denying the F.TC. its preliminary injunction.
Victoria Graham, a spokeswoman for the F.T.C., said the agency was focused on appealing the judge's order declining to block the deal from closing in the United States.
"The F.T.C. continues to believe this deal is a threat to competition," she said in a statement.
Microsoft convinced a federal judge in July that the F.T.C.'s arguments about the merger harming competition were not strong enough to stop the deal from closing. The company then announced in August that it had struck a deal aimed at addressing the concerns of the C.M.A., the British regulator. Microsoft said it would give Ubisoft Entertainment, a rival game publisher, the rights to license all current and future Activision games for distribution on streaming platforms, meaning games played by harnessing the power of the cloud.
The C.M.A. had worried that Microsoft's exclusive control of the popular Activision games would help it attain a monopoly in the nascent cloud gaming industry, but the Ubisoft deal alleviated its concerns.
For Microsoft, closing the deal is "a win for their Xbox strategy," said Joost van Dreunen, a video game analyst who teaches at New York University. "It's also, perhaps more importantly, a win for Microsoft as a company" because it culminates a yearslong effort to improve its relationship among regulators and in Washington, he said.
When it announced the acquisition in January 2022, Microsoft committed to closing the deal by mid-July of this year or paying Activision a $ 3 billion breakup fee. Ultimately, it needed a little more time, and the two companies agreed to extend the deadline to mid-October.
Now, the merger has the potential to reshape competition in the video game industry. Microsoft has long been criticized for lagging behind competitors like Sony and Nintendo in its quality of games, and it has lacked a substantial presence in the fast-growing mobile-gaming sector.
Activision's King division, which produces the mobile game Candy Crush, will give Microsoft a significant boost in that area. Call of Duty games alone have generated more than $ 30 billion in lifetime revenue. And Activision's portfolio of other popular titles, like Diablo and World of Warcraft, could make its game subscription service, Xbox Game Pass, even more enticing.
Activision had not allowed those marquee titles on a subscription platform, betting that it could make more money by selling them individually. But Microsoft has indicated that it will have no such qualms, because the future of its gaming ambitions rests on its Netflix-style Game Pass offering, which has more than 25 million subscribers who pay about $ 10 a month for access to a catalog of games.
"At 25 million subscribers, they're losing money, but at 100 million, they're probably making money; at 200 million, they're making a lot of money," said Michael Pachter, a tech analyst for Wedbush Securities. "They know they'll never get from 25 to 50 without a game like Call of Duty."
Activision said this month that it expected its games would begin showing up on Game Pass sometime next year. Aside from offering Activision's games on Game Pass, Microsoft has indicated it plans to allow Activision to continue operating as an independent studio. Still, being under Microsoft's umbrella could be a win for both shareholders and the company's employees, analysts said.
When the proposed merger was announced, Activision was undergoing a cultural upheaval after a California lawsuit accused the company of fostering a sexist workplace environment in which women were routinely harassed. Its chief executive, Bobby Kotick, faced calls to resign. Now, he could exit the company, earning more than $ 400 million for completing the merger.
Activision has said it has worked to improve its culture, strengthened anti-harassment policies and released a transparency report this year that detailed actions it has taken and said there had "never been widespread or systemic harassment."
In a note to employees on Friday, Mr. Kotick wrote that "combining with Microsoft will bring new resources and new opportunities to our extraordinary teams worldwide." He said he would stay at Activision through the end of the year, reporting to Mr. Spencer.
Mr. Spencer, in his blog post, wrote that Microsoft's gaming division had "a culture that strives to empower everyone to do their best work, where all people are welcome."
As part of an agreement with the Communications Workers of America union last year, Microsoft also pledged to remain neutral toward any Activision employees' efforts to unionize, a push that began last year.
"The win for people not in the C-suite," Mr. van Dreunen said, "is they will now be working for an employer that maintains perhaps higher standards in its relationship with its employees."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For one critic, every encounter with this Shakespeare play deepens her understanding of its insights into grief, family and gender.
A few weeks ago two friends and I were talking about our obsessions. One had been sleepless all week, playing the new Zelda video game with few breaks. The other revealed that she was deep into Taylor Swift. I said I had so many fandoms that I didn't know if I could name a favorite.
My Swiftie friend quickly set me straight. "We already know your main fandom," she said. "Hamlet."
It's true. If you look at my bookshelves, the art on my walls, even the art on my skin, you'll find anime references and mythological figures, lines from Eliot and Chekhov and illustrations from Borges and Gorey stories. But none of these interests enjoys a prominence as great as the one afforded "Hamlet" in my home -- and on my body, where the majority of my tattoos, by far, are inspired by the play.
My friends know well that I've seen numerous productions of the work, recite Hamlet's monologues to myself, even put Kenneth Branagh or Laurence Olivier's "Hamlet" on in the background as I clean my apartment. For me, the text's themes -- about death, duality, gender, family -- deepen each time I read, see or hear "Hamlet," and as I grow older, new insights are revealed about the characters and the language.
I first read "Hamlet" in high school, as an artsy poetry-writing teenager who found death a fascinating, albeit abstract, concept. I imagined the young prince -- witty, privileged yet tortured, and forever trapped in his own head -- as kin. He was less a lofty figure of English literature than the emo kid I crushed on, abandoning his math homework to read Dante's "Inferno" as angsty pop punk played in the background.
When I watched Michael Almereyda's 2000 "Hamlet" film soon after, it did little to disabuse me of this notion. Taking place in New York City, with Ethan Hawke playing a hipster film student who's heir to the "Denmark Corporation," this "Hamlet" was contemporary, rife with irony. Watching Hamlet offer the great existential query of "to be or not to be" while strolling the "action movie" aisles of a Blockbuster store, I learned that even tragedy can contain a hearty dose of comedy.
When I reread the play for a class on Shakespeare's tragedies a few years later, I became fixated on one line in particular: "The rest is silence." With these four words, Hamlet's last ones in the play, the prince is acknowledging his final breath, but also perhaps breaking the fourth wall, announcing the end of the play like Prospero at the end of "The Tempest." Or maybe Hamlet is offering us the line in consolation: After five acts of musing on death, he can assure us that death is simple, and it's quiet. This line is now tattooed on my right arm.
In Branagh's 1996 "Hamlet" film, an unabridged adaptation that paired inspired direction with refined performances and respect for the text, Branagh wheezes out the words, his eyes glassy and staring into the distance. "Silence" lands after a pause, as though he's listening to the deafening silence of all of humanity that's preceded him.
From Olivier's fervent philosophizing Dane in the 1948 film to David Tennant's lithe, boyish interpretation in the Royal Shakespeare Company's 2008 production, there's a reason that Prince Hamlet remains one of the most coveted roles an actor, especially a young man of a certain age and celebrity, can take on. "Hamlet" is, after all, a man's play.
In Hawke's "Hamlet" and Mel Gibson's visceral, sensually charged 1990 "Hamlet" I first realized how often directors use the female characters as stand-ins for fatalistic, taboo love. (Which is why I also savor gender-crossed Hamlets, whether in the form of the theater pioneer Sarah Bernhardt in 1899 or Ruth Negga in 2020.) Queen Gertrude is either stupid, selfish or promiscuous, blinded by her untamed lust. Many productions opt for a physical staging of Act III, Scene 4, when Hamlet accosts his mother in her bedchamber. Hawke's Hamlet grabs his mother in a black robe, then presses her against a set of closet doors. Gibson's deranged Hamlet also fights and clutches at Gertrude, as did Andrew Scott's in the 2017 London production by Robert Icke. Thomas Ostermeier's wild "Hamlet" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last year emphasized Gertrude's sexuality to an extreme, having her slink and shimmy as though overwhelmed with sexual energy. The text implies that a woman too free with her affections digs her own grave.
That includes, of course, Hamlet's eternally damned love interest, Ophelia (memorialized on my right forearm with a skull and pansy). I used to dismiss her as a frail female stereotype, and have craved a production or adaptation that could give this character agency -- any kind of agency -- within the space of her grieving, her madness and her death.
Kenny Leon's otherwise underwhelming "Hamlet" at the Delacorte this summer did just that. Solea Pfeiffer played an Ophelia who matched Hamlet in wit and sass, who spoke with a knowingness and rage that lifted the character from her 17th-century home into the present.
This duality in Ophelia -- between sincerity and performance, raving madness and clear, articulated rage -- is welcome. It's a duality that many directors literalize in their productions overall, some using mirrors as nods to Hamlet's constant reflections at the expense of action, others turning to hint at the divide between presentation and truth.
But as much as "Hamlet" can serve as a character study, for me the story extends far beyond a production's conceptualization of a lost prince with a splintered ego. This is a story that begins and ends with grief.
I have a tattoo for Hamlet and his dear, departed father -- a jeweled sword piercing a cracked skull in a crown. Having lost my dad almost a decade ago, I'm familiar with the feeling of being haunted by a father who may not be a literal king but perhaps just a patriarch taking the same cheap shots from the afterlife, like Pap in James Ijames's "Fat Ham." In the play, a Black, queer take on "Hamlet" in conversation with Shakespeare's original text, Hamlet is not just tied to his father through a sense of filial obligation but also through guilt, regret, shame. In Pap I saw my own father's flaws -- the spite, the prejudice, the toxic masculinity. It made me wonder how much of Hamlet's grief is for his father, and how much for the stability his father symbolized.
Lately I've been listening with more regularity to Hamlet's "To be or not to be" monologue, that great conference with death that feels as germane to the English language -- our rhetoric, our poetry, our elocution, our linguistic imagination -- as soil to the Earth. In the span of about a week this summer, I lost a grandmother, and a dear friend shared that his cancer had returned. Having buried both her parents in the past two years, my mother has been talking more about funeral arrangements and where our family would like to spend our post-mortem days. I, on the other hand, take less stock in the expensive ceremonies and planning around death. I don't plan to make a show of my finale; like Hamlet, I wonder what it will even mean -- in that everlasting sleep, who knows what dreams will come?
I didn't fall in love with "Hamlet" because of its action and intrigue; I love the play because it lets me reconnect with the spaces where death has brushed my life. "Hamlet" helps me sit with my own existential fears, all packaged in words of wit and elegance. Because I'm convinced now that if you let Shakespeare in, his voice becomes the one bellowing from the backstage of your life.

Full text: Jim Ryan, who has been with the company for nearly 30 years, has led one of the most dominant businesses in the video game industry.
Jim Ryan, who leads Sony's PlayStation video game console business, will retire next year, Sony said on Wednesday.
Mr. Ryan joined Sony in 1994, and has held various executive positions at the company. He became the chief executive of Sony Interactive Entertainment, a subsidiary of Sony, in 2019.
"I've found it increasingly difficult to reconcile living in Europe and working in North America," Mr. Ryan, who is British, wrote in a blog post announcing his retirement.
Hiroki Totoki, another top executive at Sony, will become the interim chief executive of SIE after Mr. Ryan's departure in March, the company said. Bloomberg earlier reported his planned retirement.
Sony has long been one of the most dominant companies in the lucrative video game industry, publishing popular franchises like Spider-Man and The Last of Us. In 2020, the company released the PlayStation 5, its latest console, to critical acclaim. Mr. Ryan wrote in a blog post in July that Sony had sold more than 40 million PlayStation 5s.
Sony's chief competitors are Nintendo, which makes the Switch console, and Microsoft, which makes the Xbox. Sony has long held an edge over Microsoft in the number of hit games it makes that are exclusive to its system, driving gamers' interest in the PlayStation.
To compete, Microsoft pioneered a new form of video game distribution: a Netflix-style subscription service in which gamers pay a monthly fee for a library of titles, rather than buying individual games.
Microsoft has also been on a spending spree in hopes of catching up to Sony, buying Bethesda Game Studios and a host of other studios in 2020 for $ 7.5 billion. Sony was a fierce objector to Microsoft's other big purchase: a $ 69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard that is still under review by regulators.
Mr. Ryan testified in a recorded video deposition with the Federal Trade Commission that he believed Microsoft's acquisition of Activision's library of games would harm PlayStation users and limit competition.
He said he believed Microsoft could withhold Call of Duty, Activision's biggest game, from PlayStation "to damage us." But a federal judge didn't buy his arguments, and the Activision deal could close next month after a British regulator's review.
Sony has also made acquisitions. Last year, it bought the game studio Bungie, which makes the Destiny franchise, for $ 3.6 billion.

A Branding Milestone in a Brown Paper Bag: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Since Bloomingdale's introduced the Big Brown Bag 50 years ago, it has become a totem of the store -- as well as a mug, an umbrella and, now, a pickleball paddle.
It has made cameos in "Friends," "Gossip Girl" and "Elf." It has been reincarnated as a cake, a Limoges porcelain box and a champagne-diamond pendant. It has been rendered in chrome-plated resin as part of a sculpture of Andy Warhol by the artist Rob Pruitt. And, as other entities in the fashion world have been airbrushed and transformed over the last five decades, its brown-kraft-paper visage has had no significant face-lifts.
It is a shopping bag -- the Big Brown Bag, from the department store Bloomingdale's -- which turns 50 this month.
To celebrate, Bloomingdale's has introduced the Big Brown Bazaar at its flagship store on 59th Street in Manhattan, which is filled with new merchandise inspired by the shopping bag, including a Big Brown pickleball paddle ( $ 98), a Big Brown journal ( $ 19.95) and a Polo Ralph Lauren sweatshirt ( $ 188) that features a bear holding a Big Brown Bag. A commemorative version of the bag, with a golden "50" and rope handles, will also be offered to store customers through October.
Introduced in 1973, the Big Brown Bag debuted amid a rebranding at Bloomingdale's that began a year earlier under Marvin Traub, then the department store's chief executive, as it celebrated a century in business.
Mr. Traub, who died in 2012, wrote in his memoir that as part of the initiative, the store's vice president of advertising and sales promotion at the time, Mary Joan Glynn, proposed a redesign of its logo and graphics. For that effort, the store tapped Massimo and Lella Vignelli, the married founders of the graphic design firm Vignelli Associates, who in 1972 had redesigned the New York City subway map. They developed a new typeface for Bloomingdale's: a modernist, sans-serif font that looked different from its earlier branding, which featured its name rendered in a swirly script that recalled a handwritten signature. Mr. Traub, in his book, wrote that Ms. Glynn named the font Bloomingtype.
Around the time the store started to use Bloomingtype, it introduced a larger size of the brown-kraft-paper shopping bags it had been giving to customers. The bigger bags were requested by the store's linens department, to better fit items like pillows and blankets. Printed on those bags were three stacked words: Big Brown Bag. Later, a Little Brown Bag was introduced for customers buying cosmetics, and after that, a Medium Brown Bag.
The bags' combination of matter-of-fact tag lines and mundane material poked at the idea of the shopping bag as a status symbol, said Emily Orr, an associate curator at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. "The bag isn't memorable due to its fancy materials or its flashy exterior," she said, but because "it's very readable and recognizable and makes design accessible."
About two decades later, the bags were reworked to incorporate the Bloomingdale's name down their sides. But by then they had already become symbolic of the department store and the lifestyle it had come to signify: a rarefied but not inaccessible mishmash of uptown and downtown sensibility epitomized by the events hosted at the flagship store in the 1970s and '80s, which drew guests like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis; the designers Diane von Furstenberg and Calvin Klein; and Mr. Warhol, who was known to carry around issues of Interview, the magazine he founded, in brown shopping bags from Bloomingdale's.
A Sampling of Bloomingdale's Shopping Bags
"If you recognized the bag you were in the Bloomingdale's tribe," said Debbie Millman, the chair of the master's program in branding at the School of Visual Arts and the host of the "Design Matters" podcast.
In the years since the Big Brown Bag debuted, Bloomingdale's has introduced other shopping bags made in collaboration with artists and designers as part of a series that the store started producing in the early 1960s. Those bags -- which have featured motifs by the fashion designer Franco Moschino and the interior designer Ettore Sottsass, among others -- were a way to communicate the store's cultural awareness to customers, said John C. Jay, a creative director of communications and marketing at Bloomingdale's from 1979 to 1992. Some are now in the permanent collections of the Cooper Hewitt and the New-York Historical Society.
"When a new bag hit the streets of Manhattan, immediately you would get calls," said Mr. Jay, who is now the president of global creative at Fast Retailing, a conglomerate that owns Helmut Lang and other brands. "People would say, 'Did you see that bag?"'
The Big Brown Bag and its ilk were never retired, though, and in 1995, the style was adapted into a brown PVC tote bag, which Bloomingdale's has since sold in various sizes. Other merchandise inspired by the shopping bag has included mugs, passport covers and key chains.
"People like to take a piece of the brand home with them," said Frank Berman, the executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Bloomingdale's. "We've done umbrellas -- Big Brown umbrellas -- we've done Big Brown beach chairs, we've done Big Brown towels, we've done Big Brown chocolate boxes."
There have also been special editions of the shopping bag. In 2018, Bloomingdale's created a Super Brown Bag, featuring characters from Super Mario Bros., to promote a collection the store released in collaboration with Nintendo. A year later, a version of the bag with an altered tag line -- Big Little Lies -- was introduced to promote a partnership with that television show and HBO.
"The No. 1 thing people associate with the brand is that Big Brown Bag," Mr. Berman said.
While leaving the Bloomingdale's flagship store on a Saturday afternoon in August, Liat Orshansky described the Big Brown Bag she was carrying as "classic." But there are other shopping bags that feel more luxurious, she said.
"Even though what's in here is Chanel shoes, it's not a Chanel bag," Ms. Orshansky, 47 and from Los Angeles, said.
Max Cantor, 35, who walked out of the store with a Medium and a Little Brown Bag, said he had once heard that you should never shop somewhere if you would be embarrassed to carry that store's bag. "It might be kind of snobby, but I think there's some truth to that," said Mr. Cantor, a video director in Brooklyn who has worked with The New York Times.
Gesturing to his brown shopping bags, he added, "I think this is kind of a fail-safe."

The Times Levels Up on the Video Game Beat: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When it comes to covering franchises such as Halo, Starfield and Legend of Zelda, Times reporters need to be on their game.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Jason Bailey, an editor on The New York Times's Culture desk, remembers feeling as if The Times had missed the opportunity to cover a major moment in pop culture.
It was October 2018, and Red Dead Redemption 2, the hotly anticipated video game prequel to the 2010 frontier saga, had just come out. The Times ran an advertisement for the game, which would go on to sell more than 55 million copies, on its front page.
But in the news pages, there was no review of the game. No feature. No acknowledgment that it had even been released.
"We review every single play or musical that opens on Broadway," Bailey said in a recent conversation. "We review hundreds of movies a year."
"And we should be doing that," he continued. "But that means we should also be reviewing and criticizing the biggest video game releases, at the very least."
When Bailey, a former editor for the National desk, joined the Culture team last fall, he set out to expand The Times's gaming coverage, enlisting journalists like Zachary Small, a culture reporter and longtime gamer, and Kellen Browning, a technology reporter on the Business desk who covers the gig economy and the video game industry.
The effort has resulted in articles like an interactive feature on how Nintendo's beloved Legend of Zelda franchise has changed gaming by Small and Rumsey Taylor, an assistant editor at The Times, and a recent feature by Browning and Matt Stevens, a Culture reporter, on how Starfield, a new role-playing game, created an open-world space adventure. On Sunday, the Arts & Leisure fall preview issue will include a page entirely focused on video games.
"One of the benefits of creating a beat at The Times is that we can be thoughtful and experimental about how we cover these games," Small said.
In a recent roundtable-style interview, Bailey, Browning and Small shared their vision for The Times's coverage and the challenges of balancing coverage for gamers and nongamers alike. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
When did you first become interested in video games?
ZACHARY SMALL When I was a child, video games were more accessible to me than visiting a museum and seeing art. I always enjoyed the stories and the puzzle aspect. Now I cover both the fine art world and the world of video games, which most people see as disparate topics. But for me, writing about either subject involves a similar exploration: how people create in different artistic mediums.
JASON BAILEY I remember getting a Nintendo Entertainment System when I was 8 for Christmas. One of the first games I played was the original Legend of Zelda. My brother and I loved playing Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt. I played Halo in my basement every day with my friends in high school.
KELLEN BROWNING I played computer games growing up, but I'm not much of a gamer. Before I started at The Times as a fellow in 2020, I had no background in covering video games, business or technology. I was assigned those topics. But now I have a unique perspective; I have one foot in the door of the industry as someone who has covered it for the last three years, but I can also translate for a more general audience.
How do you balance writing for gamers and keeping articles accessible for readers who are less familiar?
SMALL We write stories for people who have at least a base-level knowledge of games. But there's a balance you need. If I'm writing about Zelda, people need to know what kind of game it is.
BROWNING It's important to have just enough explanation for the casual reader. I think about writing for my parents. They don't know much about tech or video games, and they need to feel included. But I don't want to over-explain something for the more hard-core reader who's like, "Why are you treating me like I'm 10 years old?"
What are some story lines you will be watching in the coming months?
BAILEY I'm excited about both small, independent studios and Triple A studios, or major gaming publishers, that are trying new things. I think we should applaud creative risk and at the very least take a more robust view of the industry in our coverage, instead of just considering the blockbuster releases.
BROWNING I'm interested in the continued ramifications of this big merger between Activision and Microsoft and seeing how that reshapes the industry. Another story we're continuing to cover is social issues around gender and diversity, as well as unionization in the gaming industry.
If you were stranded on a desert island and could only bring one video game, what would it be?
BROWNING Age of Empires: Definitive Edition, the remastered version from 2018.
BAILEY I'm going to pull out a deep cut: One of the most underrated games is Power Stone 2 on the Sega Dreamcast. It's a Super Smash Bros.-style fighting game.
SMALL I would reframe the question and recommend that any person who had never played a game before should try We Love Katamari. You roll a sticky ball and accumulate clutter until you're as big as a planet, and then you roll other planets. It shows why gaming is an artistic medium in its own right: It changes your perspective on the world, but you also have a direct stake in the action.

Full text: Mortal Kombat, Super Mario Bros. and more are coming this season.
It has been such a fruitful year for video games that you couldn't blame someone for wanting a light fall lineup to finish titles like Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur's Gate 3. For better or worse, this season is stacked with AAA releases, long-awaited sequels and promising independent games. (Some games will be available before their official launch dates because of early-access programs.)
September
MORTAL KOMBAT 1 The fighting franchise that drew crowds at arcades in the early 1990s has conjured new gruesome fatalities for its second narrative reboot. A cast of familiar characters such as Scorpion, Kitana and Johnny Cage will be assisted in battle by partner fighters who leap onscreen. (Sept. 19; PC, Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation 5, Microsoft Xbox Series X|S)
LIES OF P This is not Disney's Pinocchio. In a retelling set in the Belle Époque era, a puppet with one mechanical arm wields rapiers and greatswords against giant monsters in his way. Success will require the meticulous combat timing of the punishing Soulslike genre, which includes Dark Souls and Elden Ring. (Sept. 19; PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)
EL PASO, ELSEWHERE Bullet time -- à la "The Matrix" and Max Payne -- is a crucial resource for a folklore researcher who descends into a supernatural motel filled with werewolves and fallen angels to confront his lover, the vampire lord Draculae. Designed by a small studio, this third-person shooter exudes neo-noir. (Sept. 26; PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)

On 1,000 Planets, High Expectations: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Starfield almost immediately nudges its players to the edges of the cosmos. In the opening hours of the role-playing video game, it's possible to land your spaceship on Earth's moon or zip 16 light-years from a remote outpost to Alpha Centauri. When you open your map and zoom out from a planet, you can behold its surrounding solar system; zoom out again, and you're scrolling past luminous stars and the mysterious worlds that orbit them.
That sprawling celestial journey within Starfield, developed by Bethesda Game Studios, reveals both the tremendous potential and the monumental challenge of an open-world space adventure. Bethesda has hyped an expansive single-player campaign with 1,000 explorable planets. And expectations around the game, officially releasing on Sept. 6 after a 10-month delay, are nearly as vast.
It's the first new universe in 25 years for Bethesda, known for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series. It's also a high-stakes moment for Microsoft, which makes the Xbox and has long faced criticism that it produces fewer hit games than its console rivals, Sony and Nintendo. To compete, Microsoft went on a spending spree, acquiring Bethesda's parent company in 2020 and agreeing to purchase Activision Blizzard in 2022, a $ 69 billion bet that is being challenged by regulators.
Now Bethesda must deliver. Known for letting players navigate competing factions and undertake eccentric quests, the studio hopes Starfield will dazzle those clamoring for engaging encounters with alien life-forms or space mercenaries as well as a sense of boundless exploration.
But creating a game the size of a galaxy is extraordinarily time-consuming and expensive, and several past attempts that shot for the stars failed to stick the landing.
"The biggest challenge you face when building any sci-fi game is the almost limitless imagination as players we have about space and about the universe," said Aaryn Flynn, the chief executive of Inflexion Games and a former general manager of BioWare, which makes the sci-fi Mass Effect series. "Players want that captured in the experience."
Todd Howard, the executive producer of Bethesda, was well aware that Starfield, which is being released for Windows computers and the Xbox Series X and S, would have to be expansive to reflect the allure of space travel.
"All of us, I think, at some point look to the sky and say, 'Man, I wonder what it would be like to blast off and land on the moon?' or 'I wonder what would be beyond that?' or 'What's in that star?' or 'Is there life out there?"' Howard said in an interview, adding: "We needed the scale to have that feeling. We could have made a game where there are four cities and four planets. But that would not have the same feeling of being this explorer."
So Starfield has promised 1,000 searchable planets, about 10 percent of which contain life in addition to quests and valuable raw materials. That scale has caused some concern that the studio responsible for glitchy releases like Skyrim and Fallout 76 is in over its head -- and that some aspects of space will be a black hole of fun.
The game's developers say they are confident they have struck the right balance by using a mix of scientific data and artificial intelligence to generate realistic planets, and then fine-tuning those worlds with human programmers who also craft the quests and the enemies that players will encounter.
"We have artists who hand-built the rocks, partly from scanning real rocks in our world and changing them," Howard said. "And then we have algorithms that create the landscape of a planet and put the rocks and the trees in all the right places."
When players land on a new planet in Starfield, they may encounter a tangle of atlas weed or discover that giant crabs can viciously attack. Those who enjoy hoarding can pick up items as innocuous as a jar of sealant in an abandoned laboratory.
But exactly how the game unfolds will differ for each player. Howard acknowledged that Starfield posed "an incredibly difficult design challenge" -- one his team tried to solve by building a planet content manager that allows certain quests to be placed as players reach the surface. One player might run into a derelict outpost; someone else might hear another spaceship's engine as she wanders. Developers have also tried to ensure that very little will happen in some cases, so that players "get some periods of loneliness," Howard said.
Despite the technological advancements that have made it possible to generate countless planets with ease, more than a dozen gaming executives, analysts and developers said in interviews that studios must be wary of overpromising what they can deliver.
No Man's Sky drew incredible hype when its developers at Hello Games spoke of a procedurally generated universe of no fewer than 18 quintillion planets. But when the game made its debut in 2016, players found its worlds uninteresting and its alien dinosaurs crude. The criticism was so harsh that one of the company's founders said he received death threats; the independent studio was investigated for false advertising and eventually cleared.
"Procedural generation can generate new maps but not compelling gameplay," said Elena Bertozzi, a professor of game design and development at Quinnipiac University. "No Man's Sky had a lot of planets with nothing interesting going on."
A spokesman for Hello Games declined to comment, referring to public remarks that one of its founders, Sean Murray, made in 2019. By then, the game had improved and was being praised for its successful postrelease updates.
"Innovation is in such short supply in the industry, and we need it so badly," Murray said at the time. "We need to encourage it, we need to foster it. We need to ask people to shoot for the moon. And if they fail on their first attempt, we need to be there to support them."
The team behind Mass Effect: Andromeda, the fourth installment in the role-playing series, also planned to leverage procedural generation, said Mac Walters, who worked for BioWare for almost two decades as a writer, producer and director and joined the Andromeda project partway through.
"There was this vision that we were going to have a thousand planets," Walters said, confirming some details of an investigation into what the gaming news site Kotaku called a "turbulent and troubled" development. When Andromeda was released in 2017, there were about a half-dozen planets to explore.
BioWare did not respond to a request for comment. Flynn, the studio's former general manager, said the team was hamstrung by decisions such as the choice to use the Frostbite game engine, which was not intended for content-heavy role-playing games. He said the team had hoped to have enough sophistication in its algorithms to make the procedurally generated worlds "indistinguishable" from what developers were making, so that they could focus on building a transporting narrative.
"We didn't get there," he said. "And so our developers still had to come over and work on the procedural content a fair bit."
When players finally got their hands on the game, many were shocked by its lack of polish. The characters' facial animations were so clumsy, they became fodder for internet memes. Critics assailed what they described as cheesy dialogue, subpar voice acting and major plot problems.
Avoiding similar pitfalls with Starfield is paramount for Microsoft, which desperately needs a new blockbuster game as its flagship franchise, Halo, fades in relevance. Some time after Bethesda announced an open-world space game in 2018, Microsoft executives learned that Sony was considering a deal to make it available exclusively on PlayStation consoles.
"When we heard that Starfield was going to potentially end up skipping Xbox -- we can't be in a position as a third-place console where we fall further behind on console ownership," Phil Spencer, the chief executive of Microsoft Gaming, testified during a court hearing in June that focused on the Activision acquisition. "We had to secure content to remain viable."
Microsoft shelled out $ 7.5 billion for ZeniMax Media, the parent company of a swath of game studios that included Bethesda, but is still looking for a return on investment. Redfall, the most prominent Xbox game resulting from the deal so far, flopped when it was released in May.
Xbox owners have also been denied a seat at this year's feast of role-playing games, including Final Fantasy XVI, which is currently available only on the PlayStation 5, and Tears of the Kingdom, a Zelda game for the Switch. Baldur's Gate 3, which has been rapturously received by computer gamers, hits the PlayStation 5 on Wednesday; an Xbox version is due later this year.
Microsoft has pioneered a shift in gaming away from $ 60 or $ 70 retail purchases and toward a Netflix-style subscription service that offers hundreds of games for between $ 10 and $ 17 per month. That service, Game Pass, had more than 25 million subscribers last year but needs a steady supply of marquee games to make it a can't-miss subscription.
If Starfield wins over players, "it becomes a crowning jewel in that portfolio," said Yung Kim, the head of partnerships at the gaming data firm Aldora and a former analyst for Piper Sandler.
Spencer said he would measure Starfield's success simply by how many people play it, regardless of how they do so. "Everything comes from that. How many people are playing across devices?" he wrote in an email. "I want Starfield to be Bethesda Game Studios' most played game ever."
Starfield draws inspiration from movies and television shows like "Interstellar," "Battlestar Galactica" and "The Martian," Howard said, but also from real organizations like NASA and Elon Musk's SpaceX. The game's main story focuses on collecting mysterious alien artifacts and can be completed in about 30 hours. But players can spend hundreds more customizing spaceships, harvesting resources, exploring planets and fighting bloodthirsty pirates.
Focusing on realism helped ground the project, Bethesda executives said. Engineers toured NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, which Ashley Cheng, Bethesda's managing director, said helped inspire Starfield's realistic simulation of the galaxy -- down to how quickly a planet rotates around its axis. The trip also helped set parameters on Starfield's procedural generation of planets to ensure that their geography was realistic.
All of the names, locations and characteristics of Starfield planets are the same for every player. Some are temperate, made of rock and filled with fauna and flora. Others are gas giants in a deep freeze that cannot be landed on. Still others have chemical water, low gravity or a surface so hot it emits scalding vapor fog. (Earth, in 2330, is essentially a desert filled with corrosive gas.)
"They all have different biomes," Angela Browder, Bethesda's studio director, said. "We all have this idea of what space is supposed to be like. Whatever you thought it was going to look like, we probably have a planet that matches up."
Browder said developers also had to weigh realism against enjoyment. Survival in space needed to be challenging, but not too burdensome. The team ditched the idea of making players refuel their spaceships, and tried to make the controls for piloting them accessible.
Their desire for accuracy also kept expectations in check. Cheng said part of the balance was making sure there was enough to do without jam-packing all 1,000 planets with content. Not every location, he said, "is supposed to be Disney World."
"The point of the vastness of space is you should feel small. It should feel overwhelming," Cheng said. "Everyone's concerned that empty planets are going to be boring. But when the astronauts went to the moon, there was nothing there. They certainly weren't bored."

Full text: Elian Peltier is The Times's West Africa correspondent, based in Dakar, Senegal. He loves diving deep in the standup comedy, live music and literary scenes of the countries he writes about. He also likes to keep an eye on emerging artists in his home country, France, and to take occasional breaks on his Nintendo Switch. From Lagos to The Legend of Zelda's Hyrule, here are five things he's been reading, playing and listening to lately.
Vagabonds!
Eloghosa Osunde's vibrant debut novel takes us to some dark and shimmering corners of Lagos through snapshot-like profiles that explore queer love, abuse and the countless traps that the city throws at its people. The result is a magical and raw portrait of one of Africa's largest and most fascinating metropolises.
Rhythm + Flow France
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This Netflix show is fun, at times epic, and reflects the richness of the French-speaking hip-hop scene. It takes us to Paris, Brussels, Marseille and beyond: French hip-hop is awash with influences from North, West and Central Africa, and there are plenty of those in the show.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
Traveling across Hyrule, the fictitious kingdom in Zelda, is soothing, exciting and, well, addictive. There are caves and skies to explore, and we can build all sorts of objects. And the game is just so beautiful. Great for meditation. A little less so when I'm on a deadline.
Gyedu-Blay Ambolley
Gyedu-Blay Ambolley is a legend of the Ghanaian music scene, mixing the highlife genre with jazz, funk and soul. His saxophone will ease your broken heart or get you out of bed on that rough weekday. I keep listening to the vinyl that my best friend gave me last year. But there are more than 30 albums to discover.
@CharityEkezie
"It's better to laugh than cry" seems to be Charity Ekezie's motto in her videos dispelling stereotypes about African countries. Ekezie, who grew up in Cameroon and now lives in Nigeria, pokes fun at people who ask her about languages spoken in Africa, internet connectivity or housing on the continent.

Longtime Voice of Nintendo's Mario to Step Away: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Charles Martinet gave Mario his popular catchphrases, including "It's a-me, Mario" and that signature "woo-hoo!" It's unclear who will voice the Nintendo character next.
The sound of the Mushroom Kingdom is about to change.
Charles Martinet, who as the official voice of the Nintendo character Mario became instantly recognizable to a generation of gamers with phrases like "It's a-me, Mario" and the unmistakable "woo-hoo," is stepping down from the role, the company said.
Instead, Martinet will step into the role of "Mario Ambassador," Nintendo said in a statement, which added that he would continue to travel the world and interact with fans.
"It has been an honor working with Charles to help bring Mario to life for so many years," the company said.
"My new Adventure begins! You are all Numba One in my heart! #woohoo !!!!!!!" Martinet wrote on social media.
Martinet has been the voice of the cheerful Italian plumber since the release of Super Mario 64 in 1996, the company said. He has also voiced Luigi, Mario's brother and sidekick, and Wario, Mario's archrival.
Super Mario 64 moved the series into three dimensions and brought much of the video game industry with it. In the game, released on the Nintendo 64, players see Mario from behind as he runs ahead. The game has attained something close to cult status since, and Martinet would go on to lend his voice to dozens more games.
A new game, "Super Mario Bros. Wonder," is set to come out in October, in which Martinet does not appear to have a role, according to his IMDB profile, where he is not listed as the character's voice.
Martinet did not voice Mario in "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" released this year, ceding the role to Chris Pratt, but he did have a small role in the film as the voice of Mario and Luigi's father.
The New York Times review of the movie mentioned that Pratt -- "who doesn't sound like the Mario of the games" -- invoked Martinet's catchphrases, including "it's a-me" and "let's a-go."
In an interview with CNN in 2017, Martinet said he had had roles on the stage and TV but knew nothing about video games when he "crashed an audition" in 1990 and was told to make up a voice for the character, "an Italian plumber from Brooklyn."
"The character for me brings out the best in me," Martinet said in the interview.

Players Need a Magic Touch To Survive Immortals of Aveum: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Author: Chen, Brian X

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Immortals of Aveum will test whether a fantasy game in the spirit of Call of Duty can succeed without traditional weapons.
From Doom to Call of Duty, first-person shooters have been immensely popular for decades. But what if the thrill for video game fans was never really about the guns?
Immortals of Aveum, arriving on Tuesday for Windows computers and the latest PlayStation and Xbox consoles, will test this theory. The game, set in a fantasy world with several kingdoms at war over the control of magic, abandons the tried-and-true formula of arming players with an arsenal of guns and bazookas. Instead, they will battle with bracelets. Or more precisely, sigils that cast spells.
In the single-player game, a battlemage named Jak joins an elite militarylike force, collecting spells to make his sigils more potent. Players rotate between three colored sigils that correspond to the familiar weapon classes in games like Counter-Strike and Halo: the blue sigil shoots long-distance energy beams akin to a sniper rifle; the green sigil acts as a rapid-fire blaster; and the red sigil's short-distance bursts are like a shotgun.
Immortals of Aveum is the first release from Ascendant Studios, a large five-year-old company mostly composed of employees caught in a sizable layoff at Telltale Games, the studio behind hits like The Walking Dead and Tales From the Borderlands. It is being published by Electronic Arts as part of its indie label focusing on new intellectual property.
Ascendant's founder, Bret Robbins, an industry veteran whose tenure includes Call of Duty, Lord of the Rings and James Bond titles, acknowledged that by swapping out guns for sigils his team was taking a risk, as is always the case when creative professionals try to break ground. But the decision simply came down to making a game he wanted to play.
"I just didn't see anyone making a fantasy version of a shooter -- a big, epic, really fast-paced, awesome fantasy game in the spirit of something like Call of Duty," he said.
Guns have charmed gamers as far back as Duck Hunt, which was packaged with the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985, but as a storytelling device, they tend to box video games into narratives that justify their presence. Early Call of Duty titles, known for their extensive weaponry inspired by real-life rifles, machine guns and pistols, centered on soldiers in World War II. Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six has followed a counterterrorist organization formed by the government. Shooter games that took creative liberties often conformed to a similar mold -- Doom, a progenitor of the genre, follows a marine fighting monsters in outer space.
Replacing guns with magic could let Immortals of Aveum, which promises about 25 hours of gameplay, tell a more unconventional story. The protagonist, Jak, is an "unforeseen," someone who preternaturally gains magic powers later in life; he fights alongside the Immortals, a group of battlemages.
Incorporating magical elements in first-person shooters is not a new phenomenon, although most games still focus on cold, hard metal. BioShock featured "plasmids" that set objects ablaze, hypnotized enemies and fired bolts of lightning. Each character in Destiny possesses distinct supernatural abilities.
Jose Zagal, a professor who teaches courses on video game design at the University of Utah, said first-person shooters have evolved to add more complexity, challenge and speed to their gameplay. Modern gamers are so sophisticated that the basic concept of running around and firing a gun is not enough.
In Immortals of Aveum, certain spell colors work better against particular types of enemies. Reflexes and timing will be tested with defense-shattering attacks, an energy shield and a magic whip to draw enemies in closer.
"It's a different kind of design for an audience that's more savvy and more demanding," Zagal said.
When first-person shooters like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom were arriving in the early 1990s, guns may have acted as a metaphor to make it simpler to grasp a new concept -- that gamers could dash around a 3-D environment and fire projectiles at enemies. But those weapons might not have been the true draw.
In a 2013 article examining the success of first-person shooters, The New Yorker concluded that the genre became popular because it maximized a mental state that the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi called "flow" -- "a state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter."
Similar to the mindfulness and satisfaction that people experience during activities that require intense focus, like rock climbing, playing chess or composing a song, fans of first-person shooters may have been hooked by the complicated split-second decision-making -- which, yes, involves shooting weapons at fast-moving objects.
For a company as young as Ascendant Studios, all that matters is how many people buy the game and spread the word to their friends. Zagal said that fresh game concepts usually just have to do well enough to raise funding for a sequel -- and that the second game is where they peak.
"I think what they're doing is exciting," Zagal said. "Will the game stick? Who knows?"

Full text: The urge to play a violent video game in the midst of the most brutal land war in Europe since World War II may seem baffling. But it's a way to cope.
In a war of tanks, there's World of Tanks.
Somewhere along the several hundred miles of front line in Ukraine, a Ukrainian soldier is probably playing World of Tanks -- the video game. A war hero recently admitted to gaming although he had to open a new account when he lost his login information. During training in June, border guards outside Bakhmut, where one of the war's bloodiest battles was fought, were found playing. And a tank crew seen grabbing a quick lunch last year had slapped a World of Tanks logo on the hull of its T-80 main battle tank.
"I'm playing from time to time, when I have a bit of free time," said Lt. Nazar Vernyhora, who last year gained public attention for his command of a real tank that destroyed armored personnel carriers and damaged a Russian tank during a battle outside of Kyiv.
Starlink satellite internet is prevalent on Ukraine's battlefields, and soldiers have smartphones. The draw of mobile video games is obvious. War is often marked by long stretches of boredom, so why turn to the enduring favorite pastime of soldiers -- throwing small rocks at bigger rocks -- when there's World of Tanks?
The urge to play a violent video game in the midst of the most brutal land war in Europe since World War II may seem baffling, but it represents an important way soldiers cope with the bloodshed around them: disassociation.
But the multiplayer game -- with its two teams of tanks and other killing machines destroying each other on a virtual battlefield -- is an eerie echo of the actual war unfolding around its uniformed player base. Ukrainian tanks, and other armored vehicles, can sometimes find themselves locked in bloody duels that their crews are also experiencing virtually.
There are two entries in the World of Tanks universe available to players in Ukraine: World of Tanks and World of Tanks Blitz. Both require an internet connection, but the latter is available to play on mobile devices. It is hard to state precisely how popular the game is on the Ukrainian battlefield, and broadly across Ukraine, given the different platforms for the games: PCs, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo and Mac computers.
Still, in visits across Ukraine's front lines by The New York Times, the game was often seen and talked about. Discussions with Ukrainian soldiers about their World of Tanks hobby yielded various explanations for the game's draw.
The soldiers in one drone unit, though, outside the embattled eastern town of Siversk, Ukraine, recoiled at the idea of playing such a violent game given the circumstances.
"Why would we play World of Tanks when it's right here?" one soldier asked, referring to the real war. Instead they play FIFA, another soldier added, a nod to a popular soccer video game.
Many Ukrainian soldiers seem to feel differently. During a recent visit to his frontline position, Anton, a commander of a Ukrainian tank company entrenched outside the embattled city of Avdiivka, showed footage of a recent battle on his computer. His favorite clip was of a Russian tank getting destroyed, its hull bursting into flames and the turret ejecting into the air.
When he minimized the video, there on the corner of his screen was the program icon for World of Tanks.
"I love World of Tanks," he said with a shrug.
Sgt. Silver, a Ukrainian soldier in an artillery unit near the eastern town of Siversk who, like most, goes by his call sign or first name for safety reasons, knew of the game's popularity among the ranks. But he figured it was a pastime that started for many before the war and had simply carried over.
"On the other hand, it is kind of an addiction," he said, as he walked back from a yard where a Russian kamikaze drone had nearly destroyed one of the brigade's rocket artillery trucks some weeks earlier.
Wargaming Group, the company that created World of Tanks, had half of its servers supporting its Russian region, with the rest spread in the United States, Europe, Australia and China. The top two highest-earning World of Tanks players in e-sports competition from 2011 to 2021 were Kirill Ponomarev, a Russian, and Dmytro Frishman, a Ukrainian. The two men were once on the same World of Tanks e-sports team.
World of Tanks Blitz saw a peak in users in mid-December 2021, with more than 50,000 people playing concurrently, according to SteamDB, a publicly available service that tracks video game users using the Steam application to play. A week after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, that number dropped to around 31,000.
Mr. Frishman, 27, who now runs a game club in Kharkiv, Ukraine, said the game most likely dropped in popularity because Wargaming Group was originally from Belarus and therefore was pro-Russian. After the invasion last year, Wargaming Group, located in Cyprus since 2011, announced that it would shutter its studio in Minsk, Belarus, and transfer operations there and in Russia to a separate company.
Part of Mr. Frishman's customer base at the game club quickly became wounded soldiers recovering away from the front, playing violent games like PUBG, Counter-Strike and, of course, World of Tanks.
"It was really hard for me to understand why they were playing these games," Mr. Frishman said Wednesday. "But then I realized they were relaxing, they were playing with their friends."
Roughly 120 miles from the club, outside the eastern city of Bakhmut, the crinkly sound of digital explosions and tank treads emanated from a tree line. There, crouched among the undergrowth, was Honey, a border guard turned infantry soldier, and his comrade. They were both playing World of Tanks on their phones. Their unit had just finished training after coming off the front line.
When approached, they acted like two raccoons caught in a trash can, putting down their phones sheepishly. Yes, some troops play World of Tanks near the front too, they said.
Asked about the similarities between war and World of Tanks, Honey said both relied on teamwork.
Elsewhere on the eastern front, Lieutenant Vernyhora, who was 21 when his tank was captured on video last year fighting a Russian foe that far outnumbered him, echoed Honey's view.
"You are kind of learning to work in a team and developing tactics in the game," he said.
"I'm trying to use the same maneuvers as in real life," Lieutenant Vernyhora added, sitting on top of one of his unit's T-72 tanks, hidden under a thicket of dense trees.
His World of Tanks habit was thwarted when he lost his login information and, with it, access to his account. He also lost all the tanks he had unlocked in the game. Running into a well-armed Russian platoon had been pretty bad, but his setback in the game, he joked, "was a disaster."
Much of World of Tanks' strategy relies on piloting a tank around battlefields that look handpicked out of World War II and other conflicts. Players rely on how fast, strong and well-armed their tanks are compared with other players', and, as in actual tank battles, can use terrain to mask and protect their armored sprites.
But even devotees of the game like Honey will point out that in real life -- especially in the shell-raked trenches of Ukraine's eastern front -- they have a different strategy: survival.
The closer you get to the shelling, Honey said, "even if there is internet, you don't really want to play."

NEAR THE FRONT LINE, Ukraine — In a war of tanks, there’s World of Tanks.
Somewhere along the several hundred miles of front line in Ukraine, a Ukrainian soldier is probably playing World of Tanks — the video game.

You Can't Take the Comics With You: [Style Desk]

Full text: When collectors die, their families face a lot of decisions, including what to do with a hundred Superman figurines.
"More times than I can remember, a spouse or child has said to me, 'If he wasn't dead, I'd kill him all over again for leaving me with this mess,"' said Greg Rohan, the president of Heritage Auctions.
Most people tend to know what to do with traditional investments after someone dies, he said, but when it comes to baseball cards, first-edition books, coins and other collectibles, the loved ones dealing with the estate can be stumped (and annoyed).
If some collectors of, say, vinyl figurines, seem to have a gene that spurs them to dedicate entire rooms of their home to inanimate rubbery friends, they are also, in many ways, just like everyone else. "People don't want to think about dying," said Maggie Thompson, 80, a former senior editor of Comic Buyer's Guide, which was a newsmagazine that covered the comic book industry. "I realize as I look around my rooms, my family is not going to know what things are."
Ms. Thompson, whose eclectic collection includes Polaroid photos, film posters and comic book art, knows firsthand that not having a plan can mean a lot of responsibility for survivors. Her brother, Paul Edgar Curtis, died last year, and her family spent months dealing with his comic books and other mementos.
The market for many collectibles has been heated of late. In April, a rare Pokémon card sold for $ 300,000 at Heritage Auctions. Last year, the original art for a comic book page featuring Spider-Man in his black costume sold for $ 3.36 million at Heritage, and a copy of Superman No. 1 went for $ 5.3 million in a private sale. In 2021, a Nintendo Mario 64 game in its original packaging sold for $ 1.5 million.
Those rarities -- and their enriched owners -- aside, collectors can have a disconnect from their families. "I'm not going home and talking to my partner or to my kids about what I collect because nine times out of 10, they don't care," said Josh Benesh, 38, the chief strategy officer and general counsel for Heritage Auctions. (His own collectibles include television and film props, American regional art and modernist jewelry.)
Many collectors keep a mental log of their wares, but they would be wise to keep a physical list and address their collections in their wills. "It's not really about doing it for the sake of money, but it's making sure that the responsible stewardship of your collection extends beyond your life," Mr. Benesh said.
Karl Heitmueller Jr., 58, runs The Daily Superman on Instagram, where he highlights his Man of Steel memorabilia. He has grappled often with the fate of his collection. "All the people to whom I plan on passing on my collections are close to my age," he said. "So it's a crapshoot. Who is going to kick first?"
Mr. Heitmueller said that his brother, who has collected more than 10,000 vinyl records, would be the primary beneficiary, with other items earmarked for friends. "It's one of those things I need to work on," he said. "If he were to die first, I wouldn't know which of his things were worth a lot of money and vice versa."
Still, Mr. Heitmueller has a vision of what he'd like to see after his demise. "I don't want a funeral," he said. "I don't want a memorial service. I don't want money wasted on any of that stuff."
Instead, he would like his family and friends to browse his collection and take what they want. "If I were to die tomorrow, I would like to think that all of them would not mind having a Superman action figure of mine to keep to remember me by," he said.
Richard Pini and Wendy Pini, whose comic book fantasy series ElfQuest debuted in 1978, wrestled with what to do with her body of work for most of their professional lives.
Over the years, they had amassed thousands of pages, including all the original art for the series, which was edited by Mr. Pini, 73, and drawn and written by Ms. Pini, 72. "He would never envision selling off the work individually," Ms. Pini said.
Mr. Pini said it would have been heartbreaking to sell it piecemeal. "I saw lines being put down." he said. "I heard the curses when she needed to reach for the whiteout. It was all very personal."
Selling the artwork could have been lucrative. "There are art dealers who come up to Richard at conventions," Ms. Pini said. "They've never even met him before, and the first thing they say is, 'You idiot. You could have made millions off of selling the artwork."'
Mr. Pini said that they knew they wouldn't be leaving their collections to their families, who weren't particularly interested in ElfQuest in the first place. The fear, then, was that the material would end up at a garage sale.
Their knight in shining armor came in the form of Karen L. Green, the curator for comics and cartoons at Columbia University, which acquired the Pinis' work in 2013. "We treasured the idea of students and fans studying it in the future after we're long gone," Ms. Pini said.
But many collections are destined for less hallowed institutions. When the end comes, families sometimes go to the most convenient source -- a local comic book store, a pawnshop -- and may only get a fraction of what their collections are worth. In other cases, a collection is worth much less than what the owner, or inheritor, thought.
Vincent Zurzolo, an owner of Metropolis Collectibles and ComicConnect, recalled a story from early in his career. A man thought he had a hugely valuable set of stamps, he said, and "my employer went down to look at the collection and it turned out all he did was cut out pictures of stamps and put them into a book."
Still, it's hard to predict the value of collectibles, given that not long ago a first-generation iPhone fetched $ 63,356.40. Collectors -- and their families -- would be wise to remember the marketplace can be fickle. "Collectibles do go down in value," Mr. Benesh said. "We don't like to talk about that, but there are Beanie Babies in this world."

Celebrating Miyazaki Movie Magic at Ghibli Park: [Travel Desk]

Full text: One of our first infractions at Ghibli Park was hoisting our 1-year-old onto the polyester tummy of a woodland spirit creature. Another was letting him slip under a barricade and shelter inside a furry bus with cat eyes for headlights.
"He's not following the protocol," I told my wife, as the staff overseeing the cat-bus play zone looked on anxiously.
"He's making a mockery of it," she said. But we didn't stop him.
Ghibli Park, which opened in November outside Nagoya, Japan, pays homage to the eccentric, enchanting films of Studio Ghibli, a company co-founded in the 1980s by the director Hayao Miyazaki. We took our two toddlers there because their favorite movie is "My Neighbor Totoro," a beloved 1988 Miyazaki film starring the spirit creature and its cat-bus sidekick.
As parents, we thought it would be fun for our boys, 3 and 1, to experience a "Totoro" immersion. And as longtime Ghibli fans, we were keen to see what the place looked like.
American visitors may wonder how Ghibli Park compares with Disney World. It doesn't really. It feels much lower-key and has no rides, exotic animals, jumbo turkey legs or animatronic American presidents, among other things. The main point is to wander around soaking up Miyazaki vibes.
Also, the park is not finished. Grafted onto an existing municipal park, it opened late last year, but as of early July only three of five planned ticketed sites were open. When I booked for a June visit, tickets to only one of those sites -- a building called "Ghibli's Grand Warehouse" -- were available to international visitors reserving through the park's website. (It was possible to book the other two sites through Japanese travel agencies, but I only learned that much later, from a Japanese speaker.)
Susan Napier, a biographer of Mr. Miyazaki at Tufts University who visited Ghibli Park in April, told me that it had struck her as a "work in progress." She also described the ticketing process, which has included lotteries and long online queues, as "byzantine and not fun."
Maybe this is why Studio Ghibli itself seems ambivalent about promoting Ghibli Park. In Japan, it has run advertisements advising fans to "take your time" visiting.
A hypothetical theme park celebrating Nintendo or Pokemon, two other iconic Japanese creative brands, would almost certainly feel more Disney World-like, said Matt Alt, the author of the 2021 book "Pure Invention: How Japan's Pop Culture Conquered the World." But he added that the park's diffuse layout and low-key marketing were in character for a studio co-founded by Mr. Miyazaki, a director who has never hidden his anticapitalist politics.
Ghibli Park is not a place to "turn your brain off," Mr. Alt told me. "It demands a level of intellectual engagement that most parks do not." When I booked our visit, in March, a bit of mental stimulation sounded nice. I imagined wandering the grounds in dappled sunlight, musing on Mr. Miyazaki's cinematic oeuvre as our boys paused to collect acorns -- just as the two sisters who star in "Totoro" do. (The boys, who are Anglo-American, love the acorn scenes so much that they learned the Japanese word for the nut, donguri, before the English one.)
In reality, we arrived just before our three-hour afternoon visiting slot at Ghibli's Grand Warehouse, and our intellectual capacity was limited. Our parental nerves were fraying from the hourlong journey from Nagoya and the general struggle of moving tiny, diapered humans around an unfamiliar place.
Our morning in Nagoya had already been tarnished by a 4 a.m. wake up and some public displays of unchecked toddler emotion. On the grounds of the 17th century Nagoya Castle, for example, our 3-year-old, nicknamed T, burst into tears when he learned that the castle was closed for renovation.
To break his mood, we took the emergency measure of buying him and his brother, nicknamed B, ice cream cones as a second breakfast. That stopped the crying, but our mounting fatigue had raised the stakes for our visit to Ghibli Park. Would the trip to meet our favorite magical creatures make all the time, money and energy that it entailed worthwhile?
Ghibli Park may see a bump in domestic tourism this summer because Mr. Miyazaki released a new film in Japan this month. But, for my family, making a pilgrimage there was all about seeing Totoro and the cat bus.
"Totoro" follows the two sisters, Mei, 4, and Satsuki, 10, as they settle into a spooky house in the Japanese countryside with their father, an archaeologist. Their mother is stuck in a nearby sanitarium, suffering from an undisclosed illness.
After Mei meets Totoro by stumbling into its lair inside a giant camphor tree (and falls asleep on its tummy), she and her sister encounter the creature a few more times and learn more about its magical powers. Eventually, as their mother's condition appears to worsen, they call in some very important favors from Totoro and the wild-eyed cat bus.
Professor Napier told me that "Totoro" illustrates an aesthetic that runs through the Ghibli catalog, and which tends to be more ambiguous and subtle than Disney's. She described it as "the immersive, low-key magic of being a human being connected with other things."
"It's a world that you like," Professor Napier, who is writing a book comparing Ghibli with Disney, said of Mr. Miyazaki's animated universe. "But it's also full of the unexpected and complex, and sometimes scary."
Totoro and the cat bus can indeed be a little frightening, especially when they flash their teeth. But the movie is much sweeter than it is scary. It's set in "a time before television," as Mr. Miyazaki once told an interviewer, and infused with sublime, hand-drawn pastoral imagery -- pastel sunsets, a snail crawling up a plant stalk -- that makes you want to be a kid growing up in rural idyll.
The film also celebrates a child's sense of wonder. Mr. Miyazaki created "Totoro" with kids in mind -- he said he hoped it would make them want to pick acorns -- and many critics have seen it as an ode to childhood innocence. It's no accident that Totoro and the cat bus are visible only to the sisters, not adults.
Maybe this is why I still cry every time I watch the final credits roll: "Totoro" reminds me that my boys will never be this young or innocent again.
In our Seoul apartment, they play with Totoro and cat-bus dolls, sleep in Totoro pajamas and sit on a Totoro potty. Their fandom is so intense that my mother-in-law bought us tickets to a "Totoro" stage adaptation at the Barbican Theater during our last trip to London.
In Nagoya, before we left for Ghibli Park, B demonstrated his enthusiasm by bringing a plastic cat bus to the hotel buffet -- and feeding it a breakfast of whipped cream. He also showed the toy to a man in a ninja costume who posed for a selfie with us outside the castle.
The ninja cracked a knowing smile, indicating that he, too, was a "Totoro" fan. "Cat bus," he said in Japanese, as if the phrase were a code word.
Ghibli Park lies in Nagakute, a small city in the hills outside Nagoya, a few stops down a highway from an Ikea. There's no Ghibli entrance gate, exactly; you just wander into an unremarkable municipal park and look around for the Ghibli sites for which you have reserved tickets months in advance.
The Grand Warehouse is a sleek, multistory building the size of a modest mall or sports arena, with plenty of sunshine streaming in through skylights. It sits near a grassy lawn, an ice rink and some future Ghibli sites that are under construction.
Inside, there are replicas of structures from the films, including the towering bathhouse from the Oscar-winning 2001 film "Spirited Away," and dozens of made-for-Instagram tableaux of Ghibli scenes and props.
The attention to detail is striking. In an area devoted to the Ghibli film "Arietty," I saw a giant drop of plastic dew affixed to a giant fake flower, for example. Nearby was an intricately detailed replica of the castle from "Howl's Moving Castle," my older son's favorite Miyazaki film after "Totoro."
"The castle, daddy!" 3-year-old T said with delight. At last, a Japanese castle that didn't make him cry.
The problem was that most of the tableaux were mobbed with Ghibli fans -- and lines that we didn't have time to stand in with restless toddlers. The building's only restaurant was similarly oversubscribed. We eventually found a kiosk advertising cake, but the staff said that the cake had run out.
After about an hour of canvassing the warehouse, we headed for "Children's Town," a play area devoted to scenes from "Totoro" and other Ghibli films.
Children's Town has three rooms. The first is a labyrinth combining scenes from more Ghibli films than I could count: The orange train from "Laputa: Castle in the Sky," the bakery from "Kiki's Delivery Service" and so on. The boys loved it, even if daddy thwacked his head following them through a crawl space.
The other rooms were devoted to "Totoro" and had mercifully higher ceilings. There was the house where Mei and Satsuki live with their dad. Over there was the camphor tree, where a giant Totoro lay regally beside some oversize donguri. And in the far corner sat the majestic, furry cat bus.
It all looked fun, kid-friendly and immersive -- almost, in fact, like something you'd find at Disney World. The boys were in heaven.
"Toe-toe-row! Toe-toe-row!" B said, standing inside the tree, with the same intonation as the movie's rousing, marching-band-style theme song.
"Hey, Totoro!" said T, who had been carefully inspecting the giant acorns. "Wake up!"
But even though Children's Town seemed designed to nurture the child's sense of wonder that Mr. Miyazaki celebrates in his movies, the warehouse staff informed us of several rules that dampened the vibe. Notably, it was forbidden to put children on Totoro's plush tummy, or to allow them to play inside the cat bus zone for longer than three minutes -- even if the zone was not crowded, which it wasn't.
The staff members were friendly, but their rules made little sense for kids as small as ours. I wondered if that was another sign that Ghibli Park was still a bit rough around the edges. Take your time visiting, as the studio says.
We grudgingly agreed to the no-tummy policy, but B wished to play nowhere else but inside the cat bus. We were with him. We had spent several months -- a good chunk of his life! -- waiting for this moment.
The staff, sensing our resolve, suggested a compromise. A special time extension could be granted under the circumstances, they said. Rather than the usual three minutes, our B could have six.
Make that nine. Then 12. Et cetera. At 5 p.m., he was among last, and smallest, Ghibli fans to leave the building.

Time to Rev Up the DeLorean: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: If he could go back in time and do it again, Bob Gale probably wouldn't change much about "Back to the Future." This 1985 science-fiction comedy, about a teenager taking a whirlwind trip to the year 1955 in a time-traveling DeLorean built by an eccentric inventor, became an endearing and endlessly quotable box-office smash.
The film, which Gale wrote with its director, Robert Zemeckis, also turned into a cultural phenomenon. It bonded its stars, Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, to their quirky characters and spawned two hit sequels that its creators envisioned as a self-contained saga.
When the words "The End" appeared onscreen in "Back to the Future Part III," Gale explained in a recent interview over lunch, it was a message to audiences. "We told the story we wanted to tell," he said. "And we're not going to milk you guys for a substandard sequel."
But like its emblematic DeLorean, the "Back to the Future" franchise has continued to reappear in the ensuing decades, in authorized books, games and theme park rides, in cast reunions and countless pop-cultural homages.
And now on Broadway: "Back to the Future: The Musical," which opens Aug. 3 at the Winter Garden Theater, follows a story that will be familiar to fans of the film. Using a time machine devised by Doc Brown, Marty McFly travels to 1955, meets his parents Lorraine and George as teenagers and must help them fall in love after he disrupts the events that led to their romantic coupling.
On its yearslong path to Broadway, "Back to the Future" has faced some challenges that are common to musical adaptations and others unique to this property.
While the show's creators sought actors to play the roles indelibly associated with the stars of the film and decided which of the movie's famous scenes merited musical numbers, they were also trying to figure out how the stage could accommodate the fundamental elements of "Back to the Future" -- like, say, a plutonium-powered sports car that can traverse the space-time continuum.
Now this "Back to the Future" arrives on Broadway with some steep expectations: After a tryout in Manchester, England, its production at the Adelphi Theater in London's West End won the 2022 Olivier Award for best new musical. The show also carries a heavy price tag -- it is being capitalized for $ 23.5 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Throughout its development process, the people behind it -- including several veterans of the "Back to the Future" series -- tried to remain true to the spirit of the films and keep intact a story that has held up for nearly 40 years.
As Gale, now 72, put it: "We didn't want to reinvent the wheel. We just want to make the wheel smooth."
But, he added, "It cannot be a slavish adaptation of the movie. Because if that's what people want to see, they should stay home and watch the movie. Let's use the theater for what theater can do."
Gale's inspiration for "Back to the Future" came in 1980 after seeing a photo of his father as a teenager in an old high-school yearbook, and he has become a passionate custodian of the franchise. That role dates back to at least 1989, the year a notorious "Back to the Future" Nintendo game was released. "One of the worst games ever," he said. "I was so horrified by that I actually gave interviews to tell people, 'Do not buy it."'
In 2005, after Zemeckis and his wife, Leslie, attended a performance of the Broadway musical "The Producers," the "Back to the Future" creators began to contemplate a stage adaptation of their film. They hired Alan Silvestri, who wrote the scores of the "Back to the Future" movies, to create new songs with Glen Ballard, the pop songwriter who had worked with Silvestri on Zemeckis's 2004 film version of "The Polar Express."
Gale said that as he and Zemeckis started to meet with Broadway producers, "They said all the right things. But their agenda really was, let's get Zemeckis and Gale off this and give it to our own people to do it."
That was something Gale said he would never allow to happen. "These characters are like my family," he said. "You don't sell your kids into prostitution."
Instead they enlisted the British producer Colin Ingram, whom Ballard had worked with on the musical adaptation of the film "Ghost." They hired the highly sought-after director Jamie Lloyd, and then parted ways with him in 2014. "The creative differences and the chemistry just didn't work," Ingram said. (Through a press representative, Lloyd confirmed that his departure was a mutual decision over creative differences but declined to comment further.)
Upon regrouping, the creators met with John Rando, who had directed "Urinetown" and "The Wedding Singer." Rando said that after their initial meeting, "I grabbed Bob by the shoulders, looked him in the eye and said, 'Bob, I love these characters. And I promise you I'm going to take really good care of them."' Within a half-hour Rando said he got the call that he was hired.
In conceiving "Back to the Future" for the stage, Gale said certain signature moments from the movie could never work: No scene of Doc Brown being attacked by disgruntled Libyan terrorists. (Now Marty speeds off in the DeLorean after Doc is overcome by radiation poisoning.) No set piece in which Marty races through the town square on a skateboard while the meathead bully Biff pursues him in a convertible. (Now the chase occurs on foot at school.) No pet dog named Einstein for Doc Brown. (Sorry, there's just no dog.)
A scene from the film where Biff is stopped before he can assault Lorraine remains in the show, though Gale acknowledged that this moment was "edgy."
"We want the audience to feel the jeopardy, and they do," Gale said, adding that there were many elements from "Back to the Future" that might not withstand scrutiny if the film were being pitched today.
Yet other familiar scenes presented opportunities for invention. Silvestri said he and Ballard were not given an exacting road map for where songs should go or what they should sound like. "We just kept trying to find our way," Silvestri said. "It's calling for a song here. It's demanding music there."
The composers felt there had to be a rousing opening number to establish the show's popped-collared, neon-colored version of the year 1985 and use the "Back to the Future" fanfare, and that became the song "It's Only a Matter of Time." There also had to be a love song for the smitten young Lorraine to serenade the enigmatic visitor she doesn't realize is her own son, which yielded the doo-wop pastiche "Pretty Baby."
Throughout the show's development, there was a consensus that high-tech engineering and video projections would help recreate complicated scenes like Doc Brown's perilous ascent of the Hill Valley clock tower during a fateful lightning storm.
But Rando said he entrusted these elements to the show's designer, Tim Hatley, and his production colleagues while the book, songs and performances were being nailed down.
"They would keep asking me, 'Hey, let's talk about the clock tower sequence,"' Rando explained. "And I said, 'Not until we get this musical right.' And we would do readings and readings, and then finally there was a moment where we're like, OK, now we can do it."
The actor Roger Bart, who has starred in musical comedies like "The Producers" and "Young Frankenstein," was an early candidate to play Doc Brown. He landed the role with the help of a video audition in which he wore a lampshade on his head (to mimic a mind-reading device Brown uses) and sung the Talking Heads song "Once in a Lifetime."
Though Christopher Lloyd is associated with the Doc Brown character, Bart said he felt it was not his job to copy that performance.
"I'm 60," Bart said. "There's a certain point where I have to go, I know I'm entertaining. I've been in front of enough audiences to know that. If you really get bogged down with that thinking, you're going to paralyze yourself."
The best way to play Doc Brown, Bart said, is to honor the spirit of Lloyd's performances, "which is to create the idea that anything can happen at any moment, by being unusual in your choices."
Casey Likes joined the show as Marty for its Broadway run, after making his Broadway debut last year in "Almost Famous." He said that his mother often compared him to Michael J. Fox when he was growing up. (The actor, who is 21, was born 16 years after "Back to the Future" was released in theaters.)
At his audition, Likes said, "I wanted to convey something that was reminiscent of Michael but not an impression."
He added, "I went with the kind of vocal inflections that he had done, while trying to deliver the bright-eyed, somewhere between cool and dorky thing that he did. And I guess it worked."
As the curtain goes up on this "Back to the Future," its creators are hopeful that it is a faithful representation of the franchise -- one that they say they have no intention of continuing cinematically. As Gale put it, "We don't need 'Back to the Future 18."'
For its stars, their day-to-day hopes are more focused on steeling their courage when they step into the show's mechanical DeLorean and trusting it will execute its stunts consistently.
With a wry chuckle, Bart said he'd rather not have a day of work that ends with anyone "being sent to the hospital while the stage managers say, 'I'm so sorry, I can't believe I called that wrong,' and you go, 'Oh, it's OK, I have insurance, it's all good.' I don't ever want to have that conversation."

Full text: "Never Alone," which closes Sunday, was an important first step in breaking the firewall between art lovers and game designers.
When the Museum of Modern Art began collecting video games a decade ago, curators boldly asserted that games were an artistic medium. Now contemporary culture is dominated by them.
The MoMA exhibition "Never Alone: Video Games and Other Interactive Design," which runs through Sunday, represents the museum's cautious advance into the gaming world at a time when digital culture has overtaken its galleries. Refik Anadol's algorithmic homage to art history still twinkles in the museum lobby; an exhibition about the importance of video swallowed the sixth floor until July 8; and galleries for its permanent collection include contemporary artifacts like the Google Maps pin and a massive schematic devoted to the interlaced chain of resources needed to create an Amazon Echo as an artificial intelligence system.
However, the museum could do more to break the firewall between art lovers and game designers. After all, this is the same institution that began a film library in 1935, exhibited utilitarian toasters and cash registers as "Machine Art" in 1934 and presented modular houses in the 1950s. Curators need to unleash that same passion for games, which struggle in the current exhibition to convey the profundity, and complexity, of their designers' thinking.
On the first floor, old computer monitors cantilevered above visitors are drawn from the museum's collection of video games. Eleven are playable; 35 games in all are viewable. Jamming buttons on their keyboards, users were hard-pressed to crane their necks to see the flickering displays above them -- a series of digital experiments from the 1990s by John Maeda, a graphic designer who now serves as Microsoft's vice president of design and artificial intelligence.
MoMA's standards for assessing the cultural importance of video games require an upgrade worthy of the medium, whose revenue is projected to reach $ 385 billion in 2023 and technologies contribute to the ongoing A.I. revolution.
For the curators Paola Antonelli and Paul Galloway, gaming is a psychological act that has defined an era when many of our relationships are mediated through screens.
And the vision of designers like Will Wright is letting players choose what lessons they want to learn -- or nothing at all. One player might experience Wright's most popular game, The Sims (included in the MoMA exhibition), as a gateway into the worlds of architecture and interior decorating; another might focus on its family-planning aspect or its staging of murder mysteries and ghost encounters.
The decision to allow games into the museum has been debated since the 2010s, when critics like Roger Ebert and Jonathan Jones declared that the medium would never rise to the status of art.
"Chess is a great game, but even the finest chess player in the world isn't an artist," Jones opined in The Guardian, "She is a chess player."
At the center of these critiques was a belief that playtime belonged to children. A similar logic harmed performance art until museums started making the genre a staple in their programming, coincidentally, around the same time that MoMA started collecting games.
"People want to be taken to a new place," Donna De Salvo, a Whitney Museum curator said of performance art in 2012 during an interview with The New York Times. "In the age of the digital and the virtual and the mediated experience, there is something very visceral about watching live performance."
The same could be said for gaming, which embraces immersion by allowing players into their virtual worlds with the touch of a controller. The simplicity of that relationship is evident in the exhibition "Never Alone," where Zen games like Flower ask players to weave petals through the wind on a journey across an imaginary landscape. But the concept flows through the veins of modern gaming, ever since Super Mario 64 tasked players with jumping into paintings stored within a museum-like castle to progress through its story.
So what prevents museums from developing more ambitious programming around games? And why has a serious institution like MoMA not staged the first major retrospective of a video game designer when it has enough material for obvious picks like Will Wright or Shigeru Miyamoto?
There are a few practical reasons. Designers rarely own rights to their creations, which are held by the publishers financing their games. In an interview, Antonelli singled out other hurdles: legal negotiations, lost source codes and obsolete technology that challenge the acquisition process. And then there are the headaches involved with hard wiring all those electronic systems in the galleries.
Yet there seems no better time for MoMA's curators to show why gaming belongs in their museum and to help visitors to understand the difference between what is scholarship and what is for sale at the Nintendo store a few blocks down the street.

Judge Nixes F.T.C. Delay Of Purchase By Microsoft: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Microsoft also said it was negotiating changes to the deal to satisfy objections made by a British regulator, which could allow it to complete its purchase of the video game giant as soon as this month.
A federal judge on Tuesday ruled against the Federal Trade Commission's attempt to delay Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, setting the stage for the tech giant and the video game publisher to merge as soon as this month.
In a 53-page decision, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California said the F.T.C. had failed to show it was likely to prove the merger would result in a substantial reduction in competition that would harm consumers.
She denied the F.T.C.'s request for a preliminary injunction, which would have delayed the deal's closing until after the agency could fight it in an internal court.
The ruling is a significant blow to the F.T.C.'s efforts to police blockbuster tech mergers more aggressively. That strategy is spearheaded by the agency's chair, Lina Khan, who has argued that Big Tech's vast influence over commerce and communications has led to anticompetitive behavior. The F.T.C. has sued Microsoft, Meta and Amazon, but it walked away from one of its cases against Meta and has had little to show for its efforts so far.
Microsoft and Activision cheered the ruling. "We're grateful to the Court in San Francisco for this quick and thorough decision," Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, wrote on Twitter. Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision, said in a statement that the merger would "enable competition rather than allow entrenched market leaders to continue to dominate."
Douglas Farrar, a spokesman for the F.T.C., said in a statement that the agency was "disappointed in this outcome given the clear threat this merger poses to open competition in cloud gaming, subscription services and consoles." Mr. Farrar added that "in the coming days we'll be announcing our next step to continue our fight to preserve competition and protect consumers."
The ruling lifts the temporary ban on closing the deal just before midnight on Friday, unless the F.T.C. obtains an extension from an appeals court.
There were also indications on Tuesday that the tide may be shifting in favor of Microsoft in Britain, which presented the other major hurdle to the acquisition. Regulators there had blocked the deal, saying it would stifle competition in streaming games online. But on Tuesday, Microsoft said it was pausing its formal appeal of that ruling to negotiate a settlement.
The regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, said in a statement that it was open to a proposal that would address its concerns, giving Microsoft significant momentum to complete its acquisition as soon as next week.
From the start, the F.T.C. appeared to be fighting an uphill battle against Microsoft, which said early last year that it would buy Activision in an effort to reshape its video game business and bring marquee games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft to its Xbox platform.
Courts have been concerned that mergers involving direct competitors will harm competition, but Microsoft and Activision are generally not considered direct competitors.
The F.T.C. sued Microsoft in its administrative court last year, but that court does not have the legal authority to stop the deal from closing. In June, the F.T.C. asked Judge Corley to take that step, saying it feared Microsoft was on the verge of completing the transaction despite the government's concerns.
Over five days of testimony last month, the F.T.C. called high-profile witnesses like Mr. Kotick and Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, as it made the case that the merger would be bad for gamers and for competition.
The F.T.C. argued that Microsoft had significant incentives to make Activision's Call of Duty -- a franchise with more than $ 30 billion in lifetime revenue -- exclusive to the Xbox, withholding it from Sony's PlayStation or degrading PlayStation versions of the game.
But Microsoft said it had signed deals with companies like Nintendo to offer Call of Duty on other platforms, and had offered Sony a deal as well. Microsoft argued that it would have no incentive to risk angering gamers by reneging on its commitments to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation, and that it would lose out on a significant amount of revenue by cutting off PlayStation players.
Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
At times, Judge Corley seemed skeptical of the F.T.C.'s case. During closing arguments, she pressed the agency repeatedly to back up its claim that if Call of Duty was withheld from PlayStation, enough players would abandon PlayStation for Xbox to make the move worthwhile for Microsoft.
"The F.T.C. has not shown it is likely to succeed on its assertion the combined firm will probably pull Call of Duty from Sony PlayStation, or that its ownership of Activision content will substantially lessen competition in the video game library subscription and cloud gaming markets," Judge Corley wrote in her decision.
"To the contrary," she added later, "the record evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content."
She wrote that despite "extensive discovery," including close to one million documents and 30 depositions, the F.T.C. "has not identified a single document which contradicts Microsoft's publicly stated commitment to make Call of Duty available on PlayStation (and Nintendo Switch)."
Her denial of a preliminary injunction means Microsoft could complete its merger with Activision as soon as this month in the United States. The companies set a July 18 deadline for the deal, with Microsoft required to pay Activision a $ 3 billion breakup fee if the deal does not go through by then. The companies could agree to delay that date, or they could merge while their appeal in Britain is pending.
It was the F.T.C.'s latest loss in a case involving one of the tech giants. While legal challenges under Ms. Khan caused companies like Lockheed Martin and the chip maker Nvidia to drop proposed acquisitions early in her tenure, the agency was unsuccessful this year in challenging Meta's purchase of a virtual reality start-up.
Ms. Khan has said she won't be deterred by courtroom losses. The chair and her allies believe that regulators were too risk-averse for years, leading to runaway corporate consolidation. They have said the F.T.C. and other government agencies must be willing to pursue novel cases even if they are not guaranteed wins.
In her ruling, Judge Corley argued that consumers benefited from Microsoft's expectation of a tough review, making agreements in writing and under oath to share Activision games with different consoles and streaming services. "That scrutiny has paid off," she wrote.

The Magic World's 50-Year Grudge: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: In 1973, Uri Geller claimed to bend metal with his mind on live television. Skeptics couldn't beat him. Now they've joined him.
In 1973, a young man named Uri Geller appeared on one of the BBC's most popular television shows, "The Dimbleby Talk-In," and announced that the laws of Newtonian physics did not apply to him. Or that, at least, was the implication. A handsome 26-year-old Israeli, dressed casually and flanked by a pair of academics, Mr. Geller performed a series of bewildering feats using nothing more, he said, than his mind.
He restarted a stopped watch. He duplicated a drawing that had been sealed in an envelope. Then he appeared to bend a fork simply by staring at it.
"It's cracking," Mr. Geller said quietly, speaking over a tight shot of his right hand, which was gently rubbing the fork between his fingers. "It's becoming like plastic."
A few seconds later, the top of the fork fell off and hit the ground. By the time the applause of the studio audience died down, Gellermania had begun.
Mr. Geller became not just a global celebrity -- a media darling who toured the world and filled auditoriums for dramatic demonstrations of cutlery abuse, with the humble spoon becoming his victim of choice -- but also the living embodiment of the hope that there was something more, something science couldn't explain. Because at the core of his performance was a claim of boggling audacity: that these were not tricks.
They were displays of raw psychic powers.
"I've never even seen a magic show," Mr. Geller, now a lean and tireless 76-year-old, said during a recent interview in Tel Aviv at the Uri Geller Museum, which he opened in 2021. "Except one: Siegfried and Roy in Las Vegas, because I missed a flight."
Charm and a seemingly bottomless supply of chutzpah were essential to his fame, and with fame came a one-man, multimillion-dollar enterprise, built on sales of tickets and books, and the reality TV show "The Next Uri Geller," which had versions in Israel, in the United States and around Europe.
It's a fortune he might have never earned, he said, without a group of highly agitated critics. Mr. Geller was long shadowed by a handful of professional magicians appalled that someone was fobbing off what they said were expertly finessed magic tricks as acts of telekinesis. Like well-matched heavyweights, they pummeled one another in the '70s and '80s in televised contests that elevated them all.
Mr. Geller ultimately emerged the victor in this war, and proof of his triumph is now on display in the museum: a coffee-table book titled "Bend It Like Geller," which was written by the Australian magician Ben Harris and published in May.
Timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the "Talk-In" appearance, the book celebrates Mr. Geller as a brilliant and highly original magical entertainer. Which represents a significant change of heart for Mr. Harris, who was once among Mr. Geller's most avid debunkers.
Today, Mr. Harris and Mr. Geller are friends who text or talk nearly every day. Mr. Harris looks back at his 1985 attack book, "Gellerism Revealed," as the work of an angry young man who had missed the point.
And the point is that Mr. Geller is an entertainer, one who'd figured out that challenging our relationship to the truth, and daring us to doubt our eyes, can inspire a kind of wonder, if performed convincingly enough. Mr. Geller's bent spoons are, in a sense, the analog precursors of digital deep fakes -- images, videos and sounds, reconfigured through software, so that anyone can be made to say or do anything.
Unlike a lot of self-help gurus, yogis and crackpot messiahs who rose to prominence in the early-1970s age of weird, Mr. Geller endured and his cultural impact proved both singular and lasting. Ikea produced a Geller stool, which had bent, wavy legs. Nintendo made a spoon-wielding Pokémon character, Kadabra, who could cause clocks to run backward. References to Mr. Geller, or mangled silverware, have appeared in songs by R.E.M., Toad the Wet Sprocket and Incubus, and made a memorable cameo in "The Matrix."
"It's not the spoon that bends," a bald tyke in a robe tells Neo, Keanu Reeves's character. "It is only yourself."
A mere handful of magicians have left anything close to this kind of imprint. If Mr. Geller can't actually bend metal with his brain -- and civility and fairness demands this "if" -- he is the author of a benign charade, which is a pretty good definition of a magic trick. Small wonder that the anti-Geller brigade has laid down its arms and led a rapprochement with the working professionals of magic. He is a reminder that people thrill at the sense that they are either watching a miracle or getting bamboozled. And now that fakery is routinely weaponized online, Mr. Geller's claims to superpowers seem almost innocent.
"I mean this in the most respectful way," said Andy Nyman, a magician and actor who a few years ago introduced a lecture by Mr. Geller at the Blackpool Magic Convention, an appearance that cemented this truce. "I think the world is aware that if he's fraudulent, there are bigger lies and bigger frauds out there that are far more damaging."
The best publicist in the world
A sloping 53-foot, 11-ton spoon made of rusting steel sits outside the Uri Geller Museum, in the ancient neighborhood of Old Jaffa. Throughout the day, tourists gather to gawk at the sculpture, and when Mr. Geller spots them, he often bounds down a flight of stairs to say hello and offer a quick performance.
"Where are you all from?" he asked a group of Austrians who gathered there one afternoon in May. As they answered, he quickly began to rub a spoon, which appeared to droop in his hands, that he autographed and tossed into the crowd, like a bouquet of flowers at a wedding.
"Thank you for coming to Israel!" he shouted as he walked off, to a round of applause.
The impromptu show lasted about a minute. He came, he bent, he left.
Mr. Geller is a vegan who doesn't drink or smoke, and he is always either moving or talking, usually both. During five hours of interviews over two days, he repeatedly said that he was shameless, which turns out to be one of his most winning qualities. He has a spoon tattooed on his right arm, which bends when he brings his hand to his shoulder, a hammy sight gag he'll perform for anyone.
He is less dogmatic about claims to otherworldly gifts now, preferring to call himself a "mystifier." Time and again, he emphasized his chops as a performer, a man who could mesmerize an audience, largely through ad-libbed interactions and charisma. When young magicians come and ask for advice, he suggests what amounts to a makeover.
"I tell them, 'Wear Armani T-shirts, buy Hermès after-shave, fix your teeth, smile a lot, be nice to people,"' he said, sitting in a chair in the middle of the museum. "This is the way to become famous and loved by your audience."
Mr. Geller never retired, though he doesn't travel much any more and spends nearly every day here, giving group tours -- no walk-ins, please -- to roughly 250 people each week. He spent $ 6 million buying and four years refurbishing the Ottoman-era soap factory, an investment he knows he will never recoup.
He and Hanna, his wife of 52 years, decided in 2015 to leave England, where the couple had raised their two now-adult children. The family had lived in a nine-bedroom mansion in a village outside London, with a Jacuzzi, tennis court, helicopter pad and glass meditation pyramid. His next-door neighbor was George Clooney; Jimmy Page lived down the street. The house is on the market for the equivalent of just under $ 10 million.
In Britain, Mr. Geller maintained the sort of profile that got him invited to appear on the TV show "I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!" as he found endless ways to insert himself into the news -- offering to stop Brexit telekinetically, taking credit for dislodging the tanker that was stuck in the Suez Canal.
"I'm the best publicist in the world, come on," he said, matter-of-factly. "You can promote Coca-Cola, you can promote a car. It doesn't matter, as long as you use my techniques, which are brilliant."
The museum tour he offers is a strange, slightly maddening way to spend an hour. Mr. Geller is a self-professed hoarder, and the place is essentially the contents of his attic, or a few storage bins, tastefully laid out as a permanent exhibition.
With a wireless microphone in hand, he seems intent on introducing visitors to every curio in the building. Here is a sculpture of a horse made of driftwood. That's a table designed by Versace. This is a piece of marble from the United Nations.
"Yoko Ono, amazing woman," he said, pausing by one of dozens of photographs. "She always wears Porsche glasses."
By the time you get to the 1976 Cadillac Fleetwood, covered with a few thousand bent spoons, you realize that the Uri Geller story isn't told at the Uri Geller Museum in a tour by Uri Geller. The experience ends with a somewhat perfunctory spoon bending ("Doesn't matter how I do it, whether it's real or not") and then a slightly off-key version of "My Way," in a recording sung by Mr. Geller himself, which plays over a montage of our hero with famous people -- including Salvador Dalí and Muhammad Ali.
"I have so many questions," said Gila Bublick, an American living in Israel, who was on the tour, sounding exhilarated and befuddled.
No questions were taken. Asked the next day why so little of his biography was in the tour, Mr. Geller said he thought his possessions were more interesting than his story.
Which is wrong.
Shouting 'Bend!' in unison
By the time Mr. Geller appeared on "The Dimbleby Talk-In," his career had already endured several near-death experiences. Raised in poverty as an only child, he said the first time he bent a spoon was while eating mushroom soup in his mother's kitchen around age 5. It didn't occur to him that this could be a profession until many years later, after he had left the army and was working as a courier and part-time model. At a photo shoot, he bent a photographer's key.
"The guy freaked out and said, 'I'm having a house party tonight, will you come and demonstrate your powers because nobody is going to believe me,"' Mr. Geller recalled. "I go and I'm stunned. I'm stunned by the reaction."
He soon was paid to perform at other parties, then small theaters, then larger ones. Each performance was unscripted and chaotic, its lack of polish only enhancing the sense that this was not a show.
Word spread about this hunky guy with the paranormal act. His first setback came in 1970, when a public relations man concocted and published a fabricated image of Mr. Geller with Sophia Loren, whom he'd visited in Rome. Ms. Loren's objections made front-page news in Israel, and Mr. Geller assumed he was finished. He asked his manager to cancel that evening's show in Haifa.
"I get to the theater that night, there are 400 people outside without tickets," he said. "It was sold out. That's when I realized controversy, for me, is a diamond on a silver platter."
There were soon more platters. In 1973, he was a guest on "The Tonight Show," and for 20 intensely awkward minutes Mr. Geller didn't even try to bend the objects laid out in front of him. (The vibe was wrong, he explained.) Astonishingly, viewers seemed to regard the failure as a sign of authenticity. Only someone at the mercy of the universe's unpredictable vibrations, went the theory, could have flopped like that.
His appearance on "The Dimbleby Talk-In," a few months later, was the performance of a daredevil who doesn't need a motorcycle to risk his life.
The two academics who sat on either side of Mr. Geller were, it turned out, both fans of the paranormal. (One, Lyall Watson, argued in a book that the emotions of plants could be registered on a lie detector.) The role of rational observer fell that evening to David Berglas, one of Britain's most famous magicians, who had been invited backstage by the show's host, David Dimbleby, to offer an instant assessment.
Now 96 years old, Mr. Berglas remembered the conversation in a recent phone interview.
"Can you do that?" Mr. Dimbleby asked him when the show was over.
"Of course," Mr. Berglas said. He then picked up a teaspoon and bent it after a brief rub.
"Yes," Mr. Dimbleby said, unimpressed, "but you're a magician."
'I basically call him a fraud'
One early Geller devotee was Mr. Harris, who watched the "Dimbleby" show from his grandparents' home in Sydney, Australia. He was 15 at the time and already a performing magician. After the broadcast, as instructed by Mr. Geller, he went to the kitchen, grabbed a utensil and willed it to bend. It did.
"I was totally sucked in," he said in a recent phone interview. "If it had been presented as a magic trick, I would have figured it out immediately. But this was something else, something standing on the edge of the unknown."
It was also something new. Psychic metal bending wasn't among the dozen or so genres of magic, like card tricks or levitation. And this guy didn't dress the part. He wore street clothes and lacked a patter. Briefly, Mr. Harris said, he imagined a better world, one in which the energy crisis was solved, in part, by mind power. Because if one guy could bend a fork, who knows what a few million people could achieve?
By 1976, Mr. Harris was becoming a doubter. That year, he attended a Geller show in Brisbane, along with about 4,000 others, and remembers an eccentric, riveting performance with a tray of spoons and keys provided by the audience and stretches of silence punctuated by inexplicable bends. After the show, Mr. Harris managed to get backstage, the first and only time he met Mr. Geller in person. He handed him a matchbox, wrapped in tinfoil and tape, containing a piece of metal.
"It was a challenge from a hyperactive young man," Mr. Harris said during a recent video call with Mr. Geller. "He started to unravel it, then said: 'No, no, no, you take it home, unravel it. See if it's bent and let me know."'
It was not bent. By then, Mr. Harris realized that the slight anomaly in his grandparents' spoon three years earlier had been there all along. Like many collections of well-worn utensils, they varied in curvature, something nobody ever had reason to notice until then.
Mr. Harris felt hoodwinked, which is why the book "Gellerism Revealed" is infused with the rage of disillusionment.
"I basically call him a fraud and charlatan," he said.
James Randi, a Canadian magician and escape artist, known professionally as the Amazing Randi, went much further. A relative unknown at the time, Mr. Randi, who eventually won a MacArthur Fellowship as a professional skeptic, was the loudest anti-Geller voice in the world.
"He is intending to enter the 'psychic healing' field soon, and when he starts into that racket he can kill people," he wrote in an edition of his book "The Truth About Uri Geller." He also called Mr. Geller a "dangerous and insidious figure," one he intended to stop "at all costs."
Those costs, it turned out, were high. Mr. Geller filed defamation lawsuits against Mr. Randi, including one for claiming that Mr. Geller was performing tricks once taught on the back of cereal boxes. The so-called cornflakes case ended with a dismissal, but over the years Mr. Randi burned through most of his $ 272,000 MacArthur grant covering personal legal expenses. He died three years ago and apparently loathed his nemesis to the end. He once asked that someone throw his cremated ashes into Mr. Geller's eyes, an obituary in The Economist stated.
The vitriol is a little hard to fathom. It's true that Mr. Geller had a lucrative side hustle in the 1980s working for mining companies who thought his putative psychic powers could help them determine where to dig. In a 1986 Financial Times story, he said that his standard fee was 1 million pounds per assignment, $ 3 million in inflation-adjusted terms, and that 11 companies had retained him.
Mr. Geller's track record as a prospector is not known, and he says he can't remember. But he never went into faith healing, nor did he charge enough to leave many with a case of buyer's remorse. He performed live shows and wrote books like "Use Your Psychic Powers to Have It All."
So watching the Geller haters now is like watching people run into nursery schools shouting that there is no Santa Claus. Consider Mr. Randi's appearance on Barbara Walters's talk show in 1974. He arrived soon after Mr. Geller had been there and entranced the host by bending her door key, apparently with his mind. Mr. Randi had now come to prove that there was nothing psychic about this feat.
"Here is my identical key," Ms. Walters told Mr. Randi, challenging him to equal Mr. Geller, and clearly hoping he would fail. "Touch it and make it bend."
A few moments later, the key is bent. Ms. Walters deflates. Suddenly, Mr. Geller seemed like a workaday huckster and the world seemed a little duller. She looked at the key that Mr. Randi had just bent and began theatrically boohooing, as if to say, "Thanks for nothing, you buzz killer."
The new sleight of hand
The science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke wrote that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic," and today magic and technology are merging. Start-ups in the field of artificial intelligence are the new masters of illusion; algorithms are the new sleight of hand.
"Geller's bent spoon demonstrations and deep fakes both create this conflict between what we think is possible and what we're seeing," said Alice Pailhès, an author of "The Psychology of Magic." "Both elicit strong emotional responses -- confusion, delight, distress, maybe even paranoia."
The stakes, of course, are different. Get fooled by a spoon bender and you're likely to end up with a smile on your face. Get fooled by a pernicious deep fake and you might end up believing that video posted last year of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine appearing to surrender, or something else that is false and noxious. This time, it's going to take much more than Mr. Randi and Ben Harris to flag the frauds.
The upsides of digital fakes have, inevitably, intrigued more than a few magicians. Drummond Money-Coutts, the English conjurer who starred in the Netflix series "Death by Magic," said in an interview that he was looking into possibilities presented by Midjourney, the program used to produce an image of Pope Francis in a Balenciaga puffer jacket that went viral a few months ago. He still prefers nondigital methods, though, which he attributes in no small part to the influence of Mr. Geller.
Mr. Money-Coutts first met Mr. Geller in 2003. A student at the British prep school Eton who was a budding magician, he invited Mr. Geller to perform for 700 gobsmacked schoolboys. ("I was told to write a letter to the catering department to apologize because they basically had no spoons for weeks after he came," Mr. Money-Coutts recalled.) Mr. Geller had relocated to Britain by then, having spent 12 tumultuous years in the United States, most of them in New York City.
While there, he had gotten rich, but he wasn't equipped for money or fame on this scale, and he was rattled by the verbal assaults. He struggled with panic attacks and became anorexic and bulimic. He also shopped compulsively, once buying 100 silk shirts during a visit to a Brioni store in Milan, few of which he ended up wearing.
"It was decadence," he said. "I had 10 Gucci suitcases, leather Gucci suitcases. Do you know how much they cost?"
Mr. Geller gradually regained his mental equilibrium, though his taste for luxury proved hard to shake. When he moved to Britain in the mid-80s -- a relative suggested it would be a better place to raise a family -- he fell in love with a house in Sonning, a village 40 miles west of London, because it reminded him of Graceland and the White House. He more than doubled the square footage of the place, adding bedrooms, a cinema room and gold-plated bathroom fixtures. At some point, about six years ago, it all started to seem berserk.
"I just looked at the marble and the crystal chandeliers," he said of Sonning Court, as the house is known, "and I thought, 'I've got to get out of this."'
He wanted to radically downsize, he said, and today he lives in a modest one-bedroom apartment not far from where he grew up. He has settled where he began. On the off chance that he can't truly bend metal with his mind, he has done something less miraculous but nearly as implausible: He has earned a very comfortable living for 50 years performing what is essentially the most acclaimed party trick of all time.
Now and then, he speaks to magicians, giving tips and what are essentially motivational speeches. Be original, be persistent, stick with a persona, he tells listeners. At the Blackpool Magic Convention in February 2020, he gave all that advice to a packed room, and he performed a newish effect. He poured radish seeds into his hand and asked everyone to chant "Sprout!" over and over. As he swirled the seeds with a finger, a close-up camera showed a green shoot that seemed to materialize in the middle of his hand, as though it had been willed to blossom.
"Among magicians," asked a cheeky young man, during the question and answer part of the presentation, "was that a magic trick? Did you sneak a bit of cress in with your seeds?"
"Are you serious?" Mr. Geller all but shouted, more amused than galled. "Do you really think that I'm going to say at the age of 73 that this was a trick? Get a life!"

TEL AVIV, Israel — In 1973, a young man named Uri Geller appeared on one of the BBC’s most popular television shows, “The Dimbleby Talk-In,” and announced that the laws of Newtonian physics did not apply to him. Or that, at least, was the implication. A handsome 26-year-old Israeli, dressed casually and flanked by a pair of academics, Geller performed a series of bewildering feats using nothing more, he said, than his mind.
He restarted a stopped watch. He duplicated a drawing that had been sealed in an envelope. Then he appeared to bend a fork simply by staring at it.
“It’s cracking,” Geller said quietly, speaking over a tight shot of his right hand, which was gently rubbing the fork between his fingers. “It’s becoming like plastic.”
A few seconds later, the top of the fork fell off and hit the ground. By the time the applause of the studio audience died down, Gellermania had begun.
Geller became not just a global celebrity — a media darling who toured the world and filled auditoriums for dramatic demonstrations of cutlery abuse, with the humble spoon becoming his victim of choice — but also the living embodiment of the hope that there was something more, something science couldn’t explain. Because at the core of his performance was a claim of boggling audacity: that these were not tricks.
They were displays of raw psychic powers.
“I’ve never even seen a magic show,” Geller, now a lean and tireless 76-year-old, said during a recent interview in Tel Aviv at the Uri Geller Museum, which he opened in 2021. “Except one: Siegfried and Roy in Las Vegas, because I missed a flight.”
Charm and a seemingly bottomless supply of chutzpah were essential to his fame, and with fame came a one-man, multimillion-dollar enterprise, built on sales of tickets and books, and the reality TV show “The Next Uri Geller,” which had versions in Israel, in the United States and around Europe.
It’s a fortune he might have never earned, he said, without a group of highly agitated critics. Geller was long shadowed by a handful of professional magicians appalled that someone was fobbing off what they said were expertly finessed magic tricks as acts of telekinesis. Like well-matched heavyweights, they pummeled one another in the ’70s and ’80s in televised contests that elevated them all.
Geller ultimately emerged the victor in this war, and proof of his triumph is now on display in the museum: a coffee-table book titled “Bend It Like Geller,” which was written by Australian magician Ben Harris and published in May.
Timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the “Talk-In” appearance, the book celebrates Geller as a brilliant and highly original magical entertainer. Which represents a significant change of heart for Harris, who was once among Geller’s most avid debunkers.
Today, Harris and Geller are friends who text or talk nearly every day. Harris looks back at his 1985 attack book, “Gellerism Revealed,” as the work of an angry young man who had missed the point.
And the point is that Geller is an entertainer, one who’d figured out that challenging our relationship to the truth, and daring us to doubt our eyes, can inspire a kind of wonder, if performed convincingly enough. Geller’s bent spoons are, in a sense, the analogue precursors of digital deepfakes — images, videos and sounds, reconfigured through software, so that anyone can be made to say or do anything.
Unlike a lot of self-help gurus, yogis and crackpot messiahs who rose to prominence in the early-1970s age of weird, Geller endured and his cultural impact proved both singular and lasting. Ikea produced a Geller stool, which had bent, wavy legs. Nintendo made a spoon-wielding Pokémon character, Kadabra, who could cause clocks to run backward. References to Geller, or mangled silverware, have appeared in songs by R.E.M., Toad the Wet Sprocket and Incubus, and made a memorable cameo in “The Matrix.”
“It’s not the spoon that bends,” a bald tyke in a robe tells Neo, Keanu Reeves’ character. “It is only yourself.”
A mere handful of magicians have left anything close to this kind of imprint. If Geller can’t actually bend metal with his brain — and civility and fairness demands this “if” — he is the author of a benign charade, which is a pretty good definition of a magic trick. Small wonder that the anti-Geller brigade has laid down its arms and led a rapprochement with the working professionals of magic. He is a reminder that people thrill at the sense that they are either watching a miracle or getting bamboozled. And now that fakery is routinely weaponized online, Geller’s claims to superpowers seem almost innocent.
“I mean this in the most respectful way,” said Andy Nyman, a magician and actor who a few years ago introduced a lecture by Geller at the Blackpool Magic Convention, an appearance that cemented this truce. “I think the world is aware that if he’s fraudulent, there are bigger lies and bigger frauds out there that are far more damaging.”
The Best Publicist in the World
A sloping 53-foot, 11-ton spoon made of rusting steel sits outside the Uri Geller Museum, in the ancient neighborhood of Old Jaffa. Throughout the day, tourists gather to gawk at the sculpture, and when Geller spots them, he often bounds down a flight of stairs to say hello and offer a quick performance.
“Where are you all from?” he asked a group of Austrians who gathered there one afternoon in May. As they answered, he quickly began to rub a spoon, which appeared to droop in his hands, that he autographed and tossed into the crowd, like a bouquet of flowers at a wedding.
“Thank you for coming to Israel!” he shouted as he walked off, to a round of applause.
The impromptu show lasted about a minute. He came, he bent, he left.
Geller is a vegan who doesn’t drink or smoke, and he is always either moving or talking, usually both. During five hours of interviews over two days, he repeatedly said that he was shameless, which turns out to be one of his most winning qualities. He has a spoon tattooed on his right arm, which bends when he brings his hand to his shoulder, a hammy sight gag he’ll perform for anyone.
He is less dogmatic about claims to otherworldly gifts now, preferring to call himself a “mystifier.” Time and again, he emphasized his chops as a performer, a man who could mesmerize an audience, largely through ad-libbed interactions and charisma. When young magicians come and ask for advice, he suggests what amounts to a makeover.
“I tell them, ‘Wear Armani T-shirts, buy Hermès after-shave, fix your teeth, smile a lot, be nice to people,’” he said, sitting in a chair in the middle of the museum. “This is the way to become famous and loved by your audience.”
Geller never retired, although he doesn’t travel much anymore and spends nearly every day here, giving group tours — no walk-ins, please — to roughly 250 people each week. He spent $6 million buying and four years refurbishing the Ottoman-era soap factory, an investment he knows he will never recoup.
He and Hanna, his wife of 52 years, decided in 2015 to leave England, where the couple had raised their two now-adult children. The family had lived in a nine-bedroom mansion in a village outside London, with a Jacuzzi, tennis court, helicopter pad and glass meditation pyramid. His next-door neighbor was George Clooney; Jimmy Page lived down the street. The house is on the market for the equivalent of just under $10 million.
In Britain, Geller maintained the sort of profile that got him invited to appear on the TV show “I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!” as he found endless ways to insert himself into the news — offering to stop Brexit telekinetically, taking credit for dislodging the tanker that was stuck in the Suez Canal.
“I’m the best publicist in the world, come on,” he said, matter-of-factly. “You can promote Coca-Cola, you can promote a car. It doesn’t matter, as long as you use my techniques, which are brilliant.”
The museum tour he offers is a strange, slightly maddening way to spend an hour. Geller is a self-professed hoarder, and the place is essentially the contents of his attic, or a few storage bins, tastefully laid out as a permanent exhibition.
With a wireless microphone in hand, he seems intent on introducing visitors to every curio in the building. Here is a sculpture of a horse made of driftwood. That’s a table designed by Versace. This is a piece of marble from the United Nations.
“Yoko Ono, amazing woman,” he said, pausing by one of dozens of photographs. “She always wears Porsche glasses.”
By the time you get to the 1976 Cadillac Fleetwood, covered with a few thousand bent spoons, you realize that the Uri Geller story isn’t told at the Uri Geller Museum in a tour by Uri Geller. The experience ends with a somewhat perfunctory spoon bending (“Doesn’t matter how I do it, whether it’s real or not”) and then a slightly off-key version of “My Way,” in a recording sung by Geller, which plays over a montage of our hero with famous people — including Salvador Dalí and Muhammad Ali.
“I have so many questions,” said Gila Bublick, an American living in Israel, who was on the tour, sounding exhilarated and befuddled.
No questions were taken. Asked the next day why so little of his biography was in the tour, Geller said he thought his possessions were more interesting than his story.
Which is wrong.
Shouting ‘Bend!’ in Unison
By the time Geller appeared on “The Dimbleby Talk-In,” his career had already endured several near-death experiences. Raised in poverty as an only child, he said the first time he bent a spoon was while eating mushroom soup in his mother’s kitchen around age 5. It didn’t occur to him that this could be a profession until many years later, after he had left the army and was working as a courier and part-time model. At a photo shoot, he bent a photographer’s key.
“The guy freaked out and said, ‘I’m having a house party tonight. Will you come and demonstrate your powers because nobody is going to believe me,’” Geller recalled. “I go and I’m stunned. I’m stunned by the reaction.”
He soon was paid to perform at other parties, then small theaters, then larger ones. Each performance was unscripted and chaotic, its lack of polish only enhancing the sense that this was not a show.
Word spread about this hunky guy with the paranormal act. His first setback came in 1970, when a public relations man concocted and published a fabricated image of Geller with Sophia Loren, whom he’d visited in Rome. Loren’s objections made front-page news in Israel, and Geller assumed he was finished. He asked his manager to cancel that evening’s show in Haifa.
“I get to the theater that night; there are 400 people outside without tickets,” he said. “It was sold out. That’s when I realized controversy, for me, is a diamond on a silver platter.”
There were soon more platters. In 1973, he was a guest on “The Tonight Show,” and for 20 intensely awkward minutes, Geller didn’t even try to bend the objects laid out in front of him. (The vibe was wrong, he explained.) Astonishingly, viewers seemed to regard the failure as a sign of authenticity. Only someone at the mercy of the universe’s unpredictable vibrations, went the theory, could have flopped like that.
His appearance on “The Dimbleby Talk-In,” a few months later, was the performance of a daredevil who doesn’t need a motorcycle to risk his life.
The two academics who sat on either side of Geller were, it turned out, both fans of the paranormal. (One, Lyall Watson, argued in a book that the emotions of plants could be registered on a lie detector.) The role of rational observer fell that evening to David Berglas, one of Britain’s most famous magicians, who had been invited backstage by the show’s host, David Dimbleby, to offer an instant assessment.
Now 96 years old, Berglas remembered the conversation in a recent phone interview.
“Can you do that?” Dimbleby asked him when the show was over.
“Of course,” Berglas said. He then picked up a teaspoon and bent it after a brief rub.
“Yes,” Dimbleby said, unimpressed, “but you’re a magician.”
‘I Basically Call Him a Fraud’
One early Geller devotee was Harris, who watched the “Dimbleby” show from his grandparents’ home in Sydney. He was 15 at the time and already a performing magician. After the broadcast, as instructed by Geller, he went to the kitchen, grabbed a utensil and willed it to bend. It did.
“I was totally sucked in,” he said in a recent phone interview. “If it had been presented as a magic trick, I would have figured it out immediately. But this was something else, something standing on the edge of the unknown.”
It was also something new. Psychic metal bending wasn’t among the dozen or so genres of magic, like card tricks or levitation. And this guy didn’t dress the part. He wore street clothes and lacked a patter. Briefly, Harris said, he imagined a better world, one in which the energy crisis was solved, in part, by mind power. Because if one guy could bend a fork, who knows what a few million people could achieve?
By 1976, Harris was becoming a doubter. That year, he attended a Geller show in Brisbane, Australia, along with about 4,000 others, and remembers an eccentric, riveting performance with a tray of spoons and keys provided by the audience and stretches of silence punctuated by inexplicable bends. After the show, Harris managed to get backstage, the first and only time he met Geller in person. He handed him a matchbox, wrapped in tinfoil and tape, containing a piece of metal.
“It was a challenge from a hyperactive young man,” Harris said during a recent video call with Geller. “He started to unravel it, then said: ‘No, no, no, you take it home, unravel it. See if it’s bent and let me know.’”
It was not bent. By then, Harris realized that the slight anomaly in his grandparents’ spoon three years earlier had been there all along. Like many collections of well-worn utensils, they varied in curvature, something nobody ever had reason to notice until then.
Harris felt hoodwinked, which is why the book “Gellerism Revealed” is infused with the rage of disillusionment.
“I basically call him a fraud and charlatan,” he said.
James Randi, a Canadian magician and escape artist, known professionally as the Amazing Randi, went much further. A relative unknown at the time, Randi, who eventually won a MacArthur Fellowship as a professional skeptic, was the loudest anti-Geller voice in the world.
“He is intending to enter the ‘psychic healing’ field soon, and when he starts into that racket he can kill people,” he wrote in an edition of his book “The Truth About Uri Geller.” He also called Geller a “dangerous and insidious figure,” one he intended to stop “at all costs.”
Those costs, it turned out, were high. Geller filed defamation lawsuits against Randi, including one for claiming that Geller was performing tricks once taught on the back of cereal boxes. The so-called cornflakes case ended with a dismissal, but over the years Randi burned through most of his $272,000 MacArthur grant covering personal legal expenses. He died three years ago and apparently loathed his nemesis to the end. He once asked that someone throw his cremated ashes into Geller’s eyes, an obituary in The Economist stated.
The vitriol is a little hard to fathom. It’s true that Geller had a lucrative side hustle in the 1980s working for mining companies that thought his putative psychic powers could help them determine where to dig. In a 1986 Financial Times story, he said that his standard fee was 1 million pounds per assignment, $3 million in inflation-adjusted terms, and that 11 companies had retained him.
Geller’s track record as a prospector is not known, and he says he can’t remember. But he never went into faith healing, nor did he charge enough to leave many with a case of buyer’s remorse. He performed live shows and wrote books like “Use Your Psychic Powers to Have It All.”
So watching the Geller haters now is like watching people run into nursery schools shouting that there is no Santa Claus. Consider Randi’s appearance on Barbara Walters’ talk show in 1974. He arrived soon after Geller had been there and entranced the host by bending her door key, apparently with his mind. Randi had now come to prove that there was nothing psychic about this feat.
“Here is my identical key,” Walters told Randi, challenging him to equal Geller, and clearly hoping he would fail. “Touch it and make it bend.”
A few moments later, the key is bent. Walters deflates. Suddenly, Geller seemed like a workaday huckster and the world seemed a little duller. She looked at the key that Randi had just bent and began theatrically boohooing, as if to say, “Thanks for nothing, you buzz killer.”
The New Sleight of Hand
Science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke wrote that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” and today magic and technology are merging. Startups in the field of artificial intelligence are the new masters of illusion; algorithms are the new sleight of hand.
“Geller’s bent spoon demonstrations and deepfakes both create this conflict between what we think is possible and what we’re seeing,” said Alice Pailhès, an author of “The Psychology of Magic.” “Both elicit strong emotional responses — confusion, delight, distress, maybe even paranoia.”
The stakes, of course, are different. Get fooled by a spoon bender and you’re likely to end up with a smile on your face. Get fooled by a pernicious deepfake and you might end up believing that video posted last year of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine appearing to surrender, or something else that is false and noxious. This time, it’s going to take much more than Randi and Harris to flag the frauds.
The upsides of digital fakes have, inevitably, intrigued more than a few magicians. Drummond Money-Coutts, the English conjurer who starred in the Netflix series “Death by Magic,” said in an interview that he was looking into possibilities presented by Midjourney, the program used to produce an image of Pope Francis in a Balenciaga puffer jacket that went viral a few months ago.

Full text: In federal court, Satya Nadella and Bobby Kotick opposed an attempt by the F.T.C. to delay Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of a video game giant.
Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, appeared in federal court on Wednesday to pledge his support for open platforms and consumer choice, underscoring the tech giant's commitment to closing its $ 70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard over regulators' objections.
"If it was up to me, I would love to get rid of the entire 'exclusives on consoles,"' Mr. Nadella testified, rebutting claims from tech regulators that Microsoft's deal for the video game giant would curtail competition and restrict Activision's games only to players on Microsoft's Xbox console. "I have no love for that world."
The fourth day of a hearing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco that could determine the deal's outcome was the highest-profile session, with appearances by Mr. Nadella and Activision's chief executive, Bobby Kotick.
The Federal Trade Commission's challenge of the blockbuster acquisition, led by its chair, Lina Khan, is viewed as a test of whether more aggressive efforts to curb tech giants can be successful. The F.T.C. is seeking a preliminary injunction that would prohibit the companies from closing the deal before the agency has the chance to argue its case in its internal court.
Microsoft has said such a lengthy delay would most likely doom the deal, a perspective that Mr. Kotick shared in his testimony on Wednesday.
The F.TC. has argued that the merger would harm competition in the video game industry and hurt consumers, because Microsoft could pull Activision's games, like Call of Duty, from its rival Sony's PlayStation console. Mr. Kotick promised that he had no intention of doing so, though the decision will not ultimately be his if his company is acquired.
"You would have a revolt if you were to remove the game from one platform," Mr. Kotick said. "It would cause reputational damage to the company." Mr. Nadella likewise said he would not withhold Call of Duty.
Under Ms. Khan, the F.T.C. has sued Meta, Microsoft and Amazon, arguing that Big Tech's immense power over communications, social media and online commerce allows the companies to build monopolies and harm consumers.
After Microsoft announced early last year that it intended to reshape its Xbox business by buying Activision, the company struck agreements with other video game companies, like Nintendo, to show regulators that the deal would benefit gamers and not curtail access to Activision's games.
Most government agencies, including the European Commission, were convinced. But the F.T.C. and the Competition and Markets Authority in Britain are trying to block the deal.
Court arguments have focused on the practice of exclusivity -- releasing a highly anticipated game only on one console. Microsoft has repeatedly promised it will not make Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox if it acquires Activision, and offered Sony a contract putting that guarantee in writing.
But the F.T.C. argued in court last week that Microsoft had moved swiftly to buy ZeniMax Media and its slate of gaming studios for $ 7.5 billion in 2020 when it realized that Sony might pay to make one of ZeniMax's important upcoming games, Starfield, exclusive to PlayStation. New ZeniMax titles, including Starfield, are now exclusive to the Xbox.
Jim Ryan, the chief executive of Sony, testified in a recorded video deposition that he thought that even if Call of Duty remained on PlayStation, Microsoft would try to "drive PlayStation gamers to the Xbox platforms" by somehow degrading the Call of Duty experience on PlayStation.
"I believe that they're going to use Call of Duty somehow to damage us," Mr. Ryan said.
But Mr. Nadella testified that he opposed a walled-off approach to gaming.
"I grew up in a company that always believed that software should run on as many platforms as possible," he said. "And I believe in that."
Microsoft has sought to portray itself as a distant third in a three-player console market dominated by Nintendo and Sony. Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox, said that as a third-place competitor, Xbox was "not a robust business."
Mr. Spencer did acknowledge that Microsoft has had discussions about potentially excluding Activision games other than Call of Duty from PlayStation.
The F.T.C. has argued that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision would also give it an unfair advantage in gaming subscription services and the nascent market for cloud gaming.
Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley is expected to decide whether to grant the injunction before July 18, the date the deal is expected to close. At times, her courtroom questions have been skeptical of some of the F.T.C.'s arguments.
The F.T.C., for example, tried to get Mr. Spencer to swear he would put Call of Duty on PlayStation for at least 10 years, no matter what terms Sony requested as part of that agreement. Judge Corley seemed to feel that such a blanket promise was unrealistic, especially if Sony asked for something unreasonable, like receiving Call of Duty for free.
"Well, it's not going to be for zero dollars," Judge Corley said, sounding impatient. "That was understood."

Full text: A five-day hearing over Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition, which the Federal Trade Commission hopes to block, began Thursday in federal court.
The first day of a weeklong hearing that could determine the outcome of Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of the video game giant Activision Blizzard opened Thursday with a promise from Microsoft: If a federal judge grants an injunction that would delay the deal's closing, Microsoft could abandon the deal altogether.
"This is going to decide whether the deal goes forward," said Beth Wilkinson, Microsoft's lead lawyer. She added that a loss could force the company into a "three-year administrative nightmare" that would sink the transaction, which it hopes to close by July 18.
That set the stakes for the hearing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, where the Federal Trade Commission began laying out its case that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision -- and its popular games like Call of Duty -- would be devastating for the video game industry.
The F.T.C. is asking Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley for a preliminary injunction, which would bar Microsoft from completing the deal before the F.T.C. had the chance to argue the case in its internal court.
The clash is broadly seen as a test of whether recent efforts to more aggressively curb the power of tech giants around the world will succeed. Lina Khan, the chair of the F.T.C., has argued that big tech companies have vast influence over online commerce and communication, allowing them to engage in anticompetitive practices that harm consumers.
"If this deal is completed, the combined company will have and is likely to have the ability and incentive to harm competition in various markets related to consoles, subscription services and cloud," James Weingarten, the F.T.C.'s lead lawyer, said in court on Thursday.
Mr. Weingarten said Microsoft could make Activision's games exclusive to its Xbox console, or degrade their quality on other platforms to make the Xbox more appealing to gamers. He pointed to Microsoft's $ 7.5 billion purchase of ZeniMax Media and its slate of game studios in 2020, after which Microsoft made some of those games exclusive to Xbox. The F.T.C. pointed to an agreement made between Disney and ZeniMax to produce a game about Indiana Jones for multiple consoles. After Microsoft bought ZeniMax, the agreement was amended and the game became exclusive to Xbox. It was an indication, the F.T.C. appeared to be arguing, that Microsoft could make future Activision games exclusive to Xbox, even amending existing deals to do so.
The F.T.C. has argued that absorbing Activision's games into Microsoft's portfolio would also give it an unfair edge in the nascent market for cloud gaming.
Sony, which makes the rival PlayStation console, has been a vocal critic of the deal, and has said that PlayStation gamers could lose access to Call of Duty -- an enormous franchise that has earned more than $ 30 billion in lifetime revenue -- if Microsoft decided to make the game exclusive to Xbox. Microsoft has denied that it would do so.
Microsoft said the Activision deal would instead be good for consumers, expanding their ability to play Activision's games through low-cost options like Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service, or through the platforms of other companies like Nintendo and Nvidia, with which it has struck deals.
Ms. Wilkinson also argued that it would be nonsensical for Microsoft to remove Call of Duty and other titles from PlayStation because the company would lose out on a huge chunk of the game's revenue. She said Sony had become the "complainer in chief" in the case, and showed an email from Sony's chief executive, Jim Ryan, suggesting that he did not really believe Microsoft would withhold Call of Duty. Microsoft also pointed to its acquisition of Mojang, which produces Minecraft. It has continued to allow Minecraft to be available across platforms.
The F.T.C. has in another lawsuit accused Meta, Facebook's parent company, of cutting off nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. On Wednesday, it sued Amazon over allegations that the company tricked users into signing up for its Prime subscription service. But the F.T.C. has had setbacks: Its challenge to Meta's purchase of a virtual reality start-up fell apart this year after a judge declined to stop the deal from closing.
The F.T.C. initially challenged Microsoft's bid for Activision using an in-house court. But that court does not have the legal authority to stop the deal. The F.T.C. asked the federal court to step in this month, saying it feared Microsoft would try to complete the deal despite the legal challenges.
The hearing in Judge Corley's courtroom could be a decisive test for the F.T.C. If Microsoft wins, it will signal that there are weaknesses in the F.T.C. case and could cause the agency to drop its challenge to the deal. But a win for the F.T.C. would be a sign that its broader challenge has legs, and could put new pressure on Microsoft and Activision to reconsider the multibillion-dollar corporate marriage.
Though most governments around the world, including the European Union, have approved the acquisition, Microsoft was dealt a setback in April when a British regulatory authority blocked it. That decision is under appeal.
The high-profile list of witnesses expected to testify before Judge Corley over the next week includes Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, and Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision. Mr. Ryan, the chief executive of Sony, will appear via a prerecorded video deposition.

Final Fantasy Takes On Old Foe: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Square Enix is trying to make a role-playing game for old fans and new gamers alike, a precarious tightrope for aging franchises.
Whenever a new Final Fantasy arrives, fans of the role-playing video games that became famous in the 1990s for using the medium to tell deep, epic stories with large, diverse casts hope that this will be the one to make the franchise relevant again.
Entries from the past decade and a half have missed the mark. The most recent installment -- Final Fantasy XV, released seven years ago -- was a letdown for many, with a disjointed story line and forgettable characters. Even its makers won't defend it.
Square Enix, the studio behind the 35-year-old franchise, is trying to right some wrongs with the release of Final Fantasy XVI for the PlayStation 5 on June 22. But like those in charge of other aging entertainment properties, such as Star Wars, the studio is walking a precarious tightrope of trying to satisfy the expectations of a dedicated fan base while attracting new audiences.
For Final Fantasy XVI, that means a departure from characteristics that have been fundamental to every game in the main series, including the ability to manage an extensive party of characters and the quirky, whimsical tone.
Now, players will control only one character, adopting the structure of successful role-playing games like The Witcher and God of War. And in the ambition to tell a story that rivals "Game of Thrones," it is the first installment to be rated "M" for mature because of its gory violence and gratuitous use of obscenities.
Square Enix says the game will pay special attention to the narrative of Clive Rosfield, a prince seeking vengeance after the destruction of his kingdom and the slaying of his brother. Players will follow the new character from adolescence to adulthood to understand his motivations and eventual transformation.
"We wanted to restore the faith in the Final Fantasy series by going back to those roots and putting the focus on the story -- and trying to make up for what happened during Final Fantasy XV," Naoki Yoshida, the producer of Final Fantasy XVI, said through an interpreter in a recent video call.
Final Fantasy XV left embarrassing scars on Square Enix because of its confusing story. Key plot points were left unexplained in part because of the decision to distribute narrative details across an animated movie and an anime series. Some downloadable content that was meant to expand the background of important characters was canceled altogether.
But it remains an open question whether Final Fantasy XVI's renewed focus on story substance will resonate with gamers.
If Square Enix goes too far in the direction of serving nostalgic fans, it risks creating the perception that Final Fantasy is out of touch with current gaming trends; if it focuses too much on new audiences, it could be scrutinized for abandoning its roots. Trying to please both groups -- as it attempted with Final Fantasy XV, which got solid reviews overall because of its high production values -- could land it safely somewhere in the middle, the plane of creative mediocrity.
Star Wars viewers saw a similar dynamic play out in the most recent trilogy. Though critics hailed its second episode, "The Last Jedi," for offering a fresh take on the space opera by suggesting that any average person could be a Jedi, franchise loyalists abhorred it for breaking the sacred canon. In response to the backlash, those violations were reversed in "The Rise of Skywalker," one of the most harshly reviewed Star Wars movies of all time.
Final Fantasy's most defining original gameplay feature -- the turn-based battle system, where players toggled through a party of characters and selected an action like casting a magic spell on an enemy -- was laid to rest more than 15 years ago.
Although some people still prefer that system, Yoshida said, gamers -- and he is no exception -- had come to expect fast-paced action as consoles became increasingly powerful.
Final Fantasy XVI will also take on a strikingly darker tone than past installments that were more lighthearted and accessible, even to children. The game opens with the invasion of the protagonist's kingdom and the brutal slaughtering of his family. Yoshida said he took this direction to reflect the harsh climate of our times.
"By showing the bad, it accentuates the good that is out there and makes it feel more real," he said. "But you know, at its core, Final Fantasy XVI is also a story about love, and it's a story about hope."
Yoshida said the decision to focus on one character in Final Fantasy XVI was driven largely by its modern battle design. Players who control Clive must rely on their timing and reflexes to attack and dodge opponents. Adding more characters to the party would have required the player to learn multiple skill sets, which Yoshida said would have made the game too complicated.
Narratives centered on a single character often conform to Joseph Campbell's concept of the hero's journey, where someone ventures into the unknown, overcomes a crisis and returns transformed. That formula has produced Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter as well as video game heroes like Link in The Legend of Zelda and Lara Croft in Tomb Raider.
Even so, that structure can constrain game designers, said Souvik Mukherjee, an assistant professor of cultural studies who leads research on video games as a storytelling medium at the Center for Studies in Social Sciences, Kolkata, India. Because the camera remains largely fixed on the protagonist, other characters the player encounters seem to exist only to aid the hero.
Some games using that approach have found ways to tell compelling stories, said Mukherjee, who pointed to Red Dead Redemption 2's tale of the gang member Arthur Morgan and his deteriorating relationship with the group's leader, Dutch van der Linde.
Square Enix, however, could struggle to pull off a similar feat. The stories in some of its biggest hits, like Final Fantasy VI (1994) and Final Fantasy VII (1997, which was rebooted in 2020), were unveiled through the perspectives of multiple characters and intersecting narratives.
The first few hours of Final Fantasy XVI illustrate the game's efforts to tell a complex story involving multiple kingdoms at war. The game will test whether Clive's solo journey, where he encounters some allies but is mostly accompanied only by his dog, will be a successful storytelling mechanism for this narrative.
The series has also had a rich history of portraying strong women, such as Final Fantasy X's Yuna, a summoner determined to banish an evil monster, and Final Fantasy VII's Tifa Lockhart, a childhood friend who saves that game's protagonist, Cloud Strife, from a mental breakdown.
The fate of women is another reason Final Fantasy XV bothered fans, said Brianna Wu, a video game developer and a longtime fan of the franchise. The game gave little airtime to the protagonist's fiancée, Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, before killing her off, and hypersexualized Cindy Aurum, a mechanic who was constantly revealing cleavage.
"As a gamer who loves Final Fantasy for the powerful women, I feel like they've really been on the wrong track for a long time from a representation point of view," she said. "Clive looks interesting, but I'm really waiting to see what they do with their women."
Yoshida, the Square Enix producer, said Final Fantasy XVI's story would resonate with gamers across generations. By following Clive from youth to adulthood, he said, the story line will be relatable to younger players just stepping into the real world and older gamers who have seen what the real world is like.
Perhaps more important is whether Clive's story will turn a fading franchise into the influential game it once was.

The Millennial Dad's Canon: [Style Desk]

Full text: On the big day, my wife gamely brought home a No. 1 Dad mug, which I sometimes drink coffee out of, and a No. 1 Dad T-shirt, which I sometimes sleep in, and a No. 1 Dad grilling spatula, which can be used to brand hamburgers and tuna steaks. This all made for a well-received Instagram post. But to be honest, it didn't really make me feel like a dad, let alone the No. 1 dad. Instead, I felt like a guy whose response to a major life milestone was to hide inside a bit.
When I think about my stepfather, who raised me, I think about the way he wielded his grill tongs, padding around the deck in his tapioca-colored apron, as if it were the most natural act in the world. Or the way he turned down the volume on the national television broadcast of N.F.L. games in favor of the local radio announcers, who "weren't idiots." Or the way he sought out a maritime museum anywhere we went on family vacation. I'm now a father of two with three years of experience, but if I tried any of those things today, I would hear a little voice in my head, saying, "Look at the big dad man, dadding it up for his family!"
"Irony has seeped into the felt of any fedora that I have ever owned -- not out of any wish of mine, but out of necessity," the essayist George W.S. Trow wrote in 1980 of his father's beloved headwear. "A fedora hat worn by me without the necessary protective irony would eat through my head and kill me."
So many of the signifiers that spring to mind when we think about dads are like this: Dated or goofy or vestigial or naïve. Take the riding lawn mower, a relic from a time before climate change made us cringe at the smell of burning gas. Or the Playboy stash, an anachronism of print culture. Or the mechanical wristwatch, an antique you can't even use to order pizza.
After three years of diaper blowouts and day-care-spawned plagues (Ever heard of something called "pleurisy"? Neither had I), I've come to see the old dad ways a little more sympathetically, and with some measure of recognition. After all, our dads were responding to the same essential dad conflict we are: the tension between giving your life over to the needs of your family and keeping enough mental space for yourself to stay sane. In that context, the rider mower makes brilliant sense. It's alone time ("What? Honey? I can't hear you! This thing's loud, huh!") that accomplishes a putatively necessary domestic task.
Still, the touchstones of Boomer dad culture have outlived their descriptive usefulness for younger generations. What, we might ask, is dad culture in 2023? Does it even exist?
Over the past month, I've reached out to dozens of millennial fathers -- friends, colleagues, perfect strangers -- to help me conduct a bit of qualitative research into the customs of the newish American dad.
I asked them what are the clothes, appliances, skills, movies, TV shows, books, video games, opinions, conversations and habits of mind that define being a dad today?
The warmth and eagerness with which they responded, often at great length and featuring Talmudic levels of nuance, suggests it's a question many of us have been mulling, privately, for quite some time.
Behind that enthusiasm, I think, is a real desire for many fathers to better define the social role they've taken on. One that has been deeply, if nebulously, changed by our evolving understanding of masculinity and who is responsible for household labor. What is the right balance between provider and caregiver? What is the amount of dumb bro stuff that can be retained? What positively distinguishes fatherhood from motherhood -- and why do even the more gender-enlightened, egalitarian among us still seem to want that identity to feel distinct?
Looking at the list as a whole, a few patterns emerge. The first is that technology and convenience have rendered optional many of the stereotypically analog dad skills of yore: Navigating, oil changing -- things of that nature. Our shows of skill are more likely to occur deep within a set of nested digital menus.
Or instead, we might demonstrate our authority through displays of taste. The millennial dad, who has spent his young adulthood becoming a sophisticated consumer, has had to negotiate a place for all this miscellaneous expertise in his family life. (Doing so can be complicated. There is no entry for coffee in the canon; those surveyed were split between dads who favored ever more complicated coffee setups and those who have made a brave -- and highly symbolic -- break with their Hario V60 in favor of a cavernous Mr. Coffee.)
Finally, the new dad culture has definitely not found it necessary to put away childish things. Fantasy football, old video games, Star Wars -- dads are finding ways to preserve the pleasures of boyhood.
There's an argument to be made that the millennial father is trapped in an eternal adolescence. But that doesn't feel right, at least to me, and certainly not to my knees, which feel every day of 38 years old. I happen to think the new dad culture reflects something positive, and even sweet: that the American father is expected, rightly, to share more of himself -- his time, his feelings, and even his most childish hobbies -- with his family.
That's why we have strong opinions about children's television and baby hiking carriers: We're trying our best at this thing. This thing, which lasts a lifetime and doesn't even come with an instruction manual. Can you believe it?

With Economic Upswing, Japan Is Luring Investors: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Japanese stock market is up nearly 30 percent this year, far ahead of the S&P 500, as firms bet that changes in how companies are run might just finally last.
The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, stood in front of the cameras in 2014 and said he was going to shake up the staid ways companies operated in Japan. It was a tall order. Shellshocked by years of economic malaise that followed the bubble of the 1980s, Japanese executives had clung to the status quo for years. Raises for employees and returns for shareholders were scarce. The consequence was an economy that barely grew.
Now, there are signs of a significant shift in how the country's corporations are run, changes that are helping to breathe life into the economy. In recent months, Canon shareholders have demanded a diverse board of directors, Citizen Watch has said it would buy back up to a quarter of its shares, and the owner of Uniqlo has promised its workers raises of up to 40 percent. The Tokyo Stock Exchange has implored companies to be "conscious" of their share prices.
Mix in a surprisingly solid economy this year, a weak currency, ultralow interest rates -- while many of the world's biggest economies are raising them -- and a plug from Warren E. Buffett and you have the world's best performing major stock market.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index has jumped nearly 30 percent this year, far outstripping the gains for the S&P 500, the benchmark in the United States. The Nikkei has not been this high since the early 1990s, when Japan was slumping into what is known as the Lost Decade.
Some observers are quick to warn that investors have been burned in the past by being overly optimistic about a change in boardroom attitudes in Japan. But company profits are improving, and Japan's economy, the world's third largest, is basking in a postpandemic glow: Inflation has finally returned, consumer spending is rising and foreign tourists are back.
"The fundamental economic conditions in Japan, including corporate earnings, are better than in the U.S., Europe and China," said Yuichi Murao, a top executive at Nomura Asset Management in Tokyo. "In terms of G.D.P. growth, Japan is going to outperform."
The increase in Japan's gross domestic product for the first three months of the year was revised sharply up last week, to an annual rate of 2.7 percent from an initial reading of 1.6 percent. The overall picture remains mixed because the bump that came from more spending by companies was geared more to restocking the shelves and warehouses, not demand from customers. Private consumption, a gauge of how much people are spending, weakened slightly.
Still, domestic demand remains strong, Mr. Murao said. Expectations are high that it will rise further, along the lines of the so-called revenge spending that other countries saw after their lockdowns ended. Japan was among the last countries to lift restrictions, and while the number of tourists is still much lower than what it was before 2020, overseas visitors are streaming in.
"They are spending much more money than before," partly because of the weak yen, Mr. Murao said. The yen has fallen to the lowest level since the 1990s against the U.S. dollar.
Japan has also made strides against two perennial problems, with wages and inflation improving in recent months. Consumer prices, excluding fresh food, rose 3.4 percent in April, the highest level in decades. Rising inflation is more welcome in Japan than it is in the United States and Europe because it has been mired at such low levels for so long, and the Japanese central bank has indicated it will stick with monetary easing.
But the inflation has largely been driven by postpandemic supply shortages, said Chong Hoon Park, the head of economic research for Japan and South Korea at Standard Chartered Bank in Seoul. "It's not driven by wage growth," Mr. Park said, adding he expects inflation to drop next year below the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target.
The challenge is to sustain and broaden the increase in incomes that segments of the economy have witnessed recently. A survey by a business group found that large companies agreed to raise salaries an average of 3.9 percent this year, the highest rate in decades.
The government is focused on raising wages and making it easier for workers to switch jobs in pursuit of higher pay. Last week, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida repeated that his economic priorities included "structural wage increases and labor market reform."
Another leader in pushing for a change in corporate thinking is the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In March, the exchange laid out a plan that would force companies trading below their book value to increase their stock prices. Some of the easiest ways to do so is to pay bigger dividends and buy back more stock. While it's unclear when the exchange will start the policy, behemoths like Toyota and Honda, which has said it plans to buy back stock this year, are likely to have to make changes. (Toyota shares are up 27 percent and Honda's 50 percent this year.)
The Nikkei 225 index rose 1.5 percent on Wednesday to 33,502, a new high for the year.
The shift to get companies to pay more attention to profits and stock prices has been evident to Seth Fischer, a hedge fund manager who has publicly agitated for change at Japanese companies for more than a decade, perhaps most memorably by urging Nintendo to get its games on mobile phones.
"We see dramatic changes in senior executives' behavior," Mr. Fischer, the founder of Oasis Capital, said from Hong Kong.
One example Mr. Fischer points to is Canon, the camera and optical equipment company. Shareholders reprimanded its chairman and chief executive, nearly ousting him from the board, for a lack of gender diversity among directors. And the continuous prodding to invest more of the money they hold in reserve has led to Japanese corporations to announce a record $ 70 billion in buybacks in the year that ended in March, according to the Nikkei newspaper. Dividends for the current year are likely to hit another record, topping $ 100 billion. All of these moves combine to put money into the real economy.
Then there is the endorsement from Mr. Buffett, who said recently that he had increased his holdings in the Japanese conglomerates Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo. In April, he told Nikkei that he planned to invest more in Japanese companies. Foreign investors have poured money into Japanese stocks since then, some shying away from China as tensions between Beijing and Washington rise.
Mr. Fischer is among the bullish. And as companies take actions to improve their value, he said, they will help the overall economy of Japan by increasing incomes.
"Investors have finally gotten notice that there is a sea change opportunity in Japan," he said.

F.T.C. Sues To Stop Deal For Activision: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The agency had sued to halt the blockbuster deal last year. Its latest move in federal court would prevent the acquisition from being completed.
The Federal Trade Commission sued Microsoft on Monday to stop the company from closing its $ 69 billion purchase of the video game powerhouse Activision Blizzard, escalating the federal government's efforts to stymie the largest consumer technology deal in decades.
In the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the F.T.C. said the move was necessary because "Microsoft and Activision have represented that they may consummate" the deal. It asked the court to issue an order blocking the acquisition's closing by the end of the day on Thursday.
The lawsuit is the latest blow to Microsoft's purchase of Activision, which makes popular video games like Call of Duty and Candy Crush. Last year, the F.T.C. sued to block the deal through an in-house court, arguing it would damage competition in various parts of the video game market. The agency filed the separate lawsuit because unlike the F.T.C.'s in-house court, a federal court can issue a restraining order to stop a purchase from being completed.
Regulatory hurdles have piled up against the blockbuster deal, which has become a test for whether behemoth tech companies can complete major acquisitions amid backlash to the firms' growing power. In April, the British Competition and Markets Authority also moved to stop the deal, though regulators in the European Union said in May that it could go forward.
Governments around the world have been challenging the power of tech giants like Microsoft. The F.T.C. has accused Meta, Facebook's parent company, of shutting off nascent competitors and has been investigating whether Amazon ran afoul of antitrust laws. The Department of Justice has filed multiple lawsuits arguing that Google has committed antitrust violations of its own.
Microsoft has appealed the British ruling to block the Activision deal and has pledged to fight the F.T.C. in court. The two companies had said they hoped the purchase would close by July.
The British portions of the deal cannot close while Microsoft's appeal moves forward. If a federal court grants the F.T.C.'s demand to stop the deal, it would also prevent Microsoft from completing the transaction in the United States.
Bill Baer, a former top government antitrust official, said the F.T.C.'s lawsuit was a response to the risk that Microsoft would try and circumvent the British ruling and "cause the injury the F.TC. is worried about" by closing the deal elsewhere.
Victoria Graham, a spokeswoman for the F.T.C., said in a statement that "Microsoft and Activision have not provided assurances" that they would not close the deal.
In a statement, Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said the company welcomed the "opportunity to present our case in federal court."
Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision, said in a note to employees that the company welcomed the news because it "accelerates the legal process." He added: "We will now have the opportunity to more quickly present the facts about our merger."
If Microsoft ushers the deal through, it would be a monumental moment for the $ 184 billion gaming industry. Microsoft earns billions of dollars each year in the video game business, but competitors like Nintendo and Sony -- which makes the PlayStation console -- have long been considered to have a better catalog of games that attract players to their devices. Adding Activision and its slate of gaming studios to Microsoft's Xbox consoles and its games subscription service could even the playing field.
Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, has made blocking corporate deals a cornerstone of her strategy to rein in the tech giants and other big companies. The chip maker Nvidia and the defense contractor Lockheed Martin have dropped proposed deals after they were challenged by the F.T.C. under Ms. Khan.
Attempts to block other deals have been less successful. Last year, the F.T.C. tried to stop Meta from buying Within, a start-up that makes a virtual reality fitness game. A federal judge declined to stop the deal from closing, and the F.T.C. dropped its broader challenge to the purchase.
Microsoft has worked to gain approval from regulators for the Activision acquisition. Since announcing the deal a year and a half ago, the company has embarked on a charm offensive, meeting with regulators around the world and cutting deals with other gaming companies to assuage concerns that the deal would reduce availability of Activision's games and raise their prices.
But those moves failed to persuade the British and American regulators to approve the deal. The new lawsuit by the F.T.C., analysts said, could be an effort by the United States to regain some prominence in the legal fight, as well as an acknowledgment that Microsoft could close the deal despite Britain's objections.
"The F.T.C. is reaffirming how adamant it is about blocking this deal," said Joost van Dreunen, a gaming analyst and professor at New York University. "They want to make sure that they are still driving the bus in this."

Full text: Abby Barr and Jed Feiman, two comedy writers who regularly riff off each other, also kept their wedding guests laughing.
Abigail Renée Barr and Jed Ronner Feiman are intensely supportive of each other in a funny sort of way. They're both comedy writers.
"That's our relationship," she said. "Building jokes." That and their mutual love for TV and pop culture.
When Ms. Barr first came across his Bumble profile in July 2016, she was delighted that "he was a native New Yorker interested in comedy and theater." (In her vows she joked: "How could this possibly work? You're from the Upper East Side. I'm from the Upper West Side.")
She spotted a screenshot on his dating profile of one of the many humor pieces he wrote in The New Yorker magazine with his writing partner. So, she searched on Google and came up with his full name (only first names appear on Bumble where women make the first move).
"It was funny, and impressive," said Ms. Barr, 29, who graduated from Oberlin with a bachelor's degree in theater. She is the social media manager for "Switched on Pop," a pop music podcast on Vulture, a New York Magazine website.
She read other pieces he co-wrote and, on his Facebook page, enjoyed his spoof as a basketball studies major at Georgetown, from where he actually graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in English and government. Mr. Feiman, 33, a comedy sketch performer and actor, is part of Never Sad with Nehemiah Markos, a comedy sketch writing and performing duo.
Mr. Feiman especially got a kick out of a photo of Ms. Barr standing inside a Casper mattress box on her dating profile.
"She looked really cute and fun," he said.
That same evening, after Ms. Barr's gig as a cat in an experimental comedy show at the Peoples Improv Theater in New York, they met at the Raines Law Room, a speakeasy in the Chelsea neighborhood.
"I knew there was a level of funny," said Ms. Barr, who initially found him a bit shy until they bonded over Stephen Sondheim, rattling off one favorite musical after another. "He is a comedian without a brash personality -- I knew I really had to crack him"
Then, he blew her away.
"He said I had a Jenny Slate vibe," she said. "She's a petite curly-haired Jewish comedian I worship."
Later, he surprised even himself.
"I'm going to kiss you now," he said. "I'm this short Jewish guy from New York and that's the best I could do to sound suave." And it worked. "She said 'Yes."'

They kissed good night before she headed back to the Upper West Side, where she lived with her parents, and was surprised that he did not run the other way when she mentioned that she still lived at home.
"We skipped all the boring games," said Mr. Feiman, who had a studio in the Hudson Yards neighborhood. "It felt so natural right away."
A week later, they went to the now-demolished Sunshine Cinema on the Lower East Side to see "Don't Think Twice," about an improv group by Mike Birbiglia. They walked all the way back to Hudson Yards, talking about the movie, and soon began seeing each other regularly.
In the fall of 2016, she attended all three of his presidential debate pizza parties.
"We had to turn on 'Family Guy' we were so stressed about the country," she said, referring to the animated sitcom. "You wouldn't do that with someone you're casually dating."
In summer 2017, after she moved to Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she ended up spending more time at his place, and in August 2019 she officially moved in.
When the pandemic hit, "Hudson Yards turned into an abandoned Disneyland," Ms. Barr said, and in October 2021 they moved to the more bustling Lower East Side, close to where his maternal grandparents once lived.
"Jed became a part of my life," she said. "He became most of my life. Then he became my whole life."
In March 2022, Mr. Feiman planned to propose at a restaurant in Rome, but the service and food were so bad, he went to Plan B.
In May, during Montreal Sketchfest in Canada, he asked Ms. Barr to film him and his partner rehearsing an intentionally bad comedy sketch in Mount Royal Park. Mr. Feiman rambled on about typical licenses, and when he got around to marriage licenses, (Ms. Barr was still filming) he got down on one knee. At the end of the year, they adopted a Cavapoo, Muppet.
"Our wedding was funny but it wasn't a joke," Mr. Feiman said.
The wedding overlapped with the series finale of "Succession," their favorite TV show. "We chose the finale to our singlehood over saying goodbye to Kendall Roy," they said in unison. They watched the final show the next day.
On May 28, Rabbi Dr. Elliot Cosgrove, from Park Avenue Synagogue, officiated before 120 guests on the garden terrace at the Wythe Hotel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where guests wore designer-emblazoned yarmulkes that said: "Ralph Lifschitz" (Ralph Lauren's original name). The two best men, who doubled as ring bearers, pulled lots of paper out of a giant Manhattan Mini Storage box until they got to two tiny velvet ring boxes.
During their cocktail hour, a string quartet from the Diller-Quaile School of Music played TV show theme songs and tunes from video games like the "Legend of Zelda." The couple's ketubah, entitled Chicken Soup for the Soul Mates, featured Manischewitz chicken soup cans in the spirit of Andy Warhol.
"Humor, love and joy," Mr. Feiman said. "Why not? That's what life should be."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- I think about Jackie Kennedy several times a day.
I have no choice.
Tour groups come by my house in Georgetown to see John Kennedy's bachelor pad, where he was living when he met Jacqueline Bouvier at a dinner party.
I eavesdropped at the window once and heard a tour guide spin the romantic yarn about how the handsome senator met the beautiful debutante and they decided to live happily ever after. Somewhere else. "Jackie told Jack he needed to get out of this dump," the guide said. "By the time he was elected president, they were living in a beautiful house down the block, which we'll go see now."
As a tonic to the coarseness of Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, I have been escaping to the cultured world of Jacqueline Bouvier in the period when Jack was diffidently courting her. (Never a Heathcliff type, Jack sometimes treated her, as Jackie once told Gore Vidal, as though she were a campaign asset, like Rhode Island.)
Carl Sferrazza Anthony's new biography, "Camera Girl," offers a lovely snapshot of Jackie's single years in D.C., working at The Washington Times-Herald.
In 1951, Jackie, who had just graduated from George Washington University with a degree in French literature, joined the paper as a gofer, answering the phone and fetching coffee. Her wealthy stepfather was friends with Arthur Krock, the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times. Krock called Frank Waldrop, the executive editor of the Washington Times-Herald, and asked "Are you still hiring little girls?" because he knew a "round-eyed, clever" one.
Waldrop would recount the story many times after Jackie became an icon. When she came to meet him, he bluntly asked her, "Do you really want to go into journalism, or do you want to hang around here until you get married?" Jackie, who fantasized about being a famous writer, replied, "No, sir, I want to make a career."
He emphasized that his paper was not a waiting room for aspiring brides. "I'd seen her type," he would later say. "Little society girls with dreams of writing the great American novel, who drop it the minute they find the great American husband."
As Anthony recounts, Jackie was so charming, witty and eager that eventually Waldrop gave her the "Inquiring Photographer" column, which none of the men wanted. Paying $ 25 a week, it was a six-days-a-week column where she would ask people a question and snap their pictures with a bulky Graflex camera. She drove a black Mercury convertible with a red interior that she "stole" from her dashing dad, Black Jack Bouvier. She called it Zelda -- because, like Zelda Fitzgerald, "she was an unreliable beauty."
Jackie was guarded -- "simultaneously overt and covert," as Anthony put it. It was hard for her to approach strangers. Sunglasses and a big camera were her shields.
She had moxie. At the door of the Washington Senators' locker room, she asked players about their hitting slump. Then they snapped their losing streak, and Jackie was hailed as a good-luck mascot.
J.F.K. once called her fey, defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "displaying magical, fairylike, or unearthly qualities," as if you'd had breakfast with a leprechaun.
The format suited her. She could display that whimsical side and even draw cartoons for the column. Waldrop gave her a byline and renamed the column "Inquiring Camera Girl." John Husted, her fiancé for three months in 1952, dismissed it as "an insipid little job," but Jackie would later say she "loved every minute."
She won over gruff male colleagues who had been skeptical of her finishing school ways. One reporter was so impressed, he offered to take her to an execution. She relished provocative questions: "Would you rather have men respect or whistle at you?" "What would you talk about if you had a date with Marilyn Monroe?"
She asked truck drivers, shouting to them when they stopped for a red light, "What do you think of Dior's spring fashion line?" At times, Anthony said, questions reflected anxieties about Jack: "The Irish author, Sean O'Faolain, claims that the Irish are deficient in the art of love. Do you agree?"
She did not hesitate to ask esoteric questions -- "In 'The Doctor's Dilemma,' George Bernard Shaw asks if it's better to save the life of a great artist who is a scoundrel, or a commonplace, honest family man. What do you think?" And she did not talk down to working-class subjects, recalling that she sought out "salty" characters.
That's probably how she found my larger-than-life dad, who was a D.C. police detective in charge of Senate security.
One night he came home and told the family that The Herald's Inquiring Camera Girl had approached him in the Capitol but he had been called to his office and couldn't answer her question.
Her name, he said, was Jacqueline Bouvier.

A Biden Goal, and a Rule in Europe: Getting Paid If Your Flight's Delayed: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The E.U.'s passenger rights law has changed how airlines schedule flights.
Rotten luck seems to follow Mattia Zenere, 31, on his travels lately.
Over the past five years, four of his flights have involved long delays or cancellations, including one misadventure -- on a trip from London to Venice, Italy -- that caused him to arrive a full day late.
But there's a silver lining: Thanks to Europe's robust consumer protection rules for airlines, in each case, the customer service professional was refunded his out-of-pocket expenses. Mr. Zenere also received an additional hardship payout from the airline for three of the disruptions.
"The law really works," he said.
For fed-up air travelers in the U.S., similar protections could be on the horizon -- and the airlines aren't happy about it. This week, President Biden and Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, announced plans to introduce new rules this year that would require airlines to pay up for travel disruptions they cause.
Following waves of pandemic-era flight interruptions and the fiasco that forced Southwest Airlines to cancel 16,700 flights around the winter holidays, Biden is betting that Americans will want the kind of protections Europeans (and non-Europeans who fly in Europe) have enjoyed for nearly 20 years.
The E.U. law is popular -- and generous. A flight delayed by more than three hours is considered canceled, and the passenger is entitled to between 250 euros ( $ 273) and 600 euros in compensation. The payout is determined by flight distance, not ticket price, which airlines have long protested.
Airlines can contest payments by arguing a disruption was caused by extraordinary circumstances such as bad weather, a strike action by air traffic controllers or "an out of the ordinary" technical issue with the plane. But European courts continue to narrow the definition of "extraordinary." This week, one ruled that even the death of a co-pilot does not get an airline out of reimbursing customers for a delay.
Biden's plan would require cash refunds for significant delays or cancellations. The president also wants to see travelers compensated for meals, hotels, ground transport and rebooking fees. U.S. airlines are not currently required to offer cash compensation for delays or cancellations; they must compensate passengers who get "bumped" from flights.
That's not enough, said Mr. Biden. "You deserve to be fully compensated. Your time matters. The impact on your life matters."
Europe's legislation has changed how airlines schedule flights, "with particular focus now on arrival punctuality," a spokesman for Eurocontrol, the intergovernmental organization that helps manage Europe's commercial airspace, told DealBook. Still, as air travel booms, E.U. flight data shows delays to be a growing problem.
Airlines oppose compensation laws. "Airlines already have financial incentives to get their passengers to their destination as planned," Willie Walsh, the director general of the International Air Transport Association, a lobbying group, said in a statement criticizing the Biden plan. "The added layer of expense that this regulation will impose will not create a new incentive, but it will have to be recouped -- which is likely to have an impact on ticket prices." Steer Group, an independent consultancy, calculated that in 2018, European airlines incurred a combined 5 billion euros in expenses to process the volume of compensation claims and pay out the meritorious ones. For each passenger disrupted, the airline incurred an average cost of 138 euros.
Europe's air passenger rights regulation hasn't been a panacea. It can still be time consuming and frustrating to secure claim money. Mr. Zenere, for example, is still arguing with Wizz Air, the airline that delayed his trip to Venice last year. They underpaid, he said, and still owe him 250 euros for the aborted trip. "I know my rights," he said. -- Bernhard Warner

Elon Musk's new hire. The entrepreneur appointed Linda Yaccarino to replace him as C.E.O. of Twitter. Yaccarino, who was NBCUniversal's head of advertising, will take over a company that has struggled to expand its ad business.
Where is Ron DeSantis? The governor of Florida barred state agencies from releasing his travel records, spurring critics to warn that he was trying to hide damaging information as he gears up for a potential presidential run. Steve Schwarzman, the billionaire co-founder of the investment giant Blackstone and a major Republican donor, met with the Florida governor recently but is unconvinced about his odds for success, according to Bloomberg.
George Santos pleads not guilty. The first-term Republican congressman from Long Island faces 13 counts of fraud, including money laundering, wire fraud, making false statements and stealing public funds. The indictment does not immediately prevent him from serving in the House, and it would take a two-thirds vote to expel him, which means Republicans would have to join Democrats.
Crashing a plane for YouTube views. A 29-year-old pilot and sky diver has admitted to intentionally crashing a small plane near Santa Barbara, Calif., as part of a video he filmed for a product sponsorship. He faces up to 20 years in prison for obstructing a federal investigation by cleaning up the crash site.
The business of Zelda
Few video games have been as revolutionary as Nintendo's Legend of Zelda, the action-adventure series launched way back in 1986. Now, almost 40 years later, the Japanese company has unveiled the latest edition of the franchise, Tears of the Kingdom, hoping that the game lives up to the significant anticipation.
It was released yesterday (some fans took the day off to play) and is expected to be a hit. But will it be enough to compensate for Nintendo's slowing sales? The company last released a new console, the Switch, in 2017, the same year it released its last Zelda game, Breath of the Wild. Both were hugely successful. But the Switch faces growing competition, and gamers are pulling back from buying expensive hardware in general. New ventures, like "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" have provided a boost. But Nintendo doesn't have plans to launch a crucial new console within the next year.
Still, the Zelda Franchise is a valuable asset with a long history and a rabid fan base. Here is a look at the game, and its business importance, by the numbers:
29 million: Copies sold of Breath of the Wild, Nintendo's most popular Zelda game.
10.3 million: Number of YouTube views of a four-minute trailer for the new Tears of the Kingdom game, which was meticulously analyzed by superfans for hints about the upcoming release.
$ 69.99: Tears of the Kingdom's price tag, a $ 10 increase from what Nintendo usually charges for new games.
125 million: Total number of Switch consoles Nintendo has sold as of March 31, according to the company's website.
15 million: Number of Switch consoles Nintendo expects to sell this fiscal year, after selling 18 million Switch units in the year to March. "Sustaining the Switch's sales momentum will be difficult in its seventh year," Nintendo's president, Shuntaro Furukawa, said on a call with investors this week, according to Bloomberg.
On our radar: 'BlackBerry'
Movies on Silicon Valley tech titans like Apple and Facebook captured the drama behind the businesses and their larger-than-life founders. "Blackberry," which hit theaters yesterday, is the latest film to tell the story of a trailblazing company. The phone, with its teeny tiny keyboard, was transformative and such a mainstay of executives' lives that it became known as the "crackberry." But the real subject of the film is the relationship between the technologists behind the device and the executives who turned into a booming business. And while the BlackBerry may have spectacularly flamed out in the iPhone era, reviewers have found plenty of current relevance in the movie. "More than anything, perhaps, "BlackBerry" highlights the vulnerability and exploitability of creatives in a cutthroat marketplace," wrote Jeannette Catsoulis for The New York Times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Legend of Zelda's latest entry required the series producer Eiji Aonuma and the director Hidemaro Fujibayashi to optimize the location of floating islands and the thrill of skydiving.
When Breath of the Wild was released in 2017, it rescued The Legend of Zelda, a video game franchise growing stale because of a predictable gameplay loop of dungeons and fetch quests. By re-emphasizing freedom, the game allowed players to experiment with a dynamic physics system in ways that even its developers did not fully anticipate.
Its direct sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, had its own burdens.
Many wondered how the series producer Eiji Aonuma and the director Hidemaro Fujibayashi might outdo themselves in the follow-up to Breath of the Wild, which has been frequently cited as one of the best games ever made.
Yet they have mostly succeeded, with an experience almost triple the size, one brimming with caves, chasms and sky islands. New abilities allow players to manipulate virtually any object and build rickshaws and rail cars. Classic dungeons return in the form of multilayered temples with interlocking puzzles.
The New York Times met this week with Aonuma and Fujibayashi to discuss Tears of the Kingdom, released for the Nintendo Switch on Friday, and what sets it apart from its predecessors.
The idea of exploring the sky began with the first mainline Zelda game that Fujibayashi directed: Skyward Sword for the Nintendo Wii. That game was criticized in part because of loading screens between the sky world and the surface world. But in Tears of the Kingdom, players can magically jump through ceilings or glide through the skies.
"When I proposed the idea to seamlessly explore the world vertically, from the very top to the very bottom, I knew I was making a ridiculous request," said Fujibayashi, who acknowledged that many of his original ideas came to fruition in Tears of the Kingdom.
Aonuma added that Skyward Sword may have left his colleague with a "sense of dissatisfaction that something was incomplete."
Tears of the Kingdom feels like the first Zelda game to fully grasp the three-dimensional space the franchise first explored in Ocarina of Time, a lauded effort for the Nintendo 64. Perfecting how players interact with the sky islands -- "If you put them too high, the islands look like specks of trash," Aonuma said -- required plenty of trial and error.
"When you are in the sky, the feeling of gravity is a little different, and we wanted to optimize the gameplay experience," Fujibayashi said. "To figure out where to draw the line, I personally dove off many sky islands to nail down what feels good."
The sky islands appear after what residents of the game's fictitious kingdom of Hyrule call the Upheaval, which unfolds in the game's opening scenes. Princess Zelda has stumbled upon the mummified remains of Ganondorf, a demon king sealed away 10,000 years ago. The seal is broken, and her loyal knight, Link, shatters his sacred sword while defending her. The hero loses consciousness; the princess vanishes in a time warp.
One major narrative theme in Tears of the Kingdom is the idea of legend: The Imprisoning War was mentioned in A Link to the Past, released for the Super Nintendo in 1991, but it was not described in detail until now. Aonuma said creating new stories often requires drawing on Zelda mythology, which fans have spent considerable hours studying to create a timeline of the franchise.
"It's like archaeology," Fujibayashi added. "It's not fixing history, but making new discoveries."
Although Tears of the Kingdom arrives with Ganondorf taking his traditional role as the series villain, it does not give much depth to his character. Some fans hoped the game would follow the lead of the GameCube's Wind Waker, which explained that Ganondorf's hatred for Hyrule was the result of enduring his own people's suffering in the arid desert.
"It's very possible from here on out that we will be able to see further character development and changes to his personality as the series continues," Aonuma said, adding, "Ganondorf is an ingredient that we use to supplement gameplay."
Forty hours into the game, it is clear that most of its content remains unseen. Beyond combat and puzzles, there are dozens of side quests, like meddling in a contentious mayoral election or helping the local newspaper's investigative reporter get his scoops.
Fujibayashi said one of his favorite side quests involved forest spirits called Koroks, who are trying to reunite; in a nod to the game's flexibility, some Nintendo employees handled them gently, while others would strap a Korok onto a rocket and shoot it into space. A quest to revive the Great Fairies by bringing a traveling band back together stood out for Aonuma, who said he had been fascinated by the Irish drum since the instrument was featured in The Wind Waker.
Similar moments of delight -- or shock -- are sprinkled throughout Tears of the Kingdom.
When a player's makeshift rocket ship falls apart, Link plummets back to earth like Wile E. Coyote. Attaching steak onto an arrow lures enemies toward a tasty meal. In one playthrough, spelunking in a deep chasm ended abruptly when a giant frog appeared, noticeable only by its single glowing eye and the sound of its inhaling Link.

How The Legend of Zelda Changed the Game: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: The footage was only two minutes long, yet that was enough to conjure months of debate over sacred relics, goddesses and swords that could easily be confused for the arcane squabbles of medievalists studying Arthurian legend.
But these self-taught experts were discussing a more recent hero's tale, one that has unfolded over the past four decades in a doomed kingdom called Hyrule. More than six million people watched the preview for hints about the next video game in Nintendo's beloved Legend of Zelda franchise. Millions more are expected to play it.
It has been a long six years since the last entry -- Breath of the Wild -- revitalized the series with the apotheosis of an open-world game, one that tantalized players to explore a vibrant environment full of ambitious quests and powerful equipment.
Breath of the Wild dropped players into the wilderness of a destroyed Hyrule with little direction beyond sight lines to inviting mountains and a castle surrounded by an evil smog. Tears of the Kingdom, the sequel that will be released for the Nintendo Switch on May 12, promises to open that world further, with sky islands and caves. The game also gives Link, its protagonist, new abilities that allow him to construct vehicles and weapons by combining an array of items in a system that rewards ingenuity.
The immersive gameplay of the Zelda franchise is bolstered by its deep mythology, convincing players they are unearthing ancient secrets.
"Someone might write an entire university dissertation on a specific part of the worlds created by Tolkien," said Ed King, a 26-year-old British gamer who translates the mysteries of the Zelda universe for his 700,000 YouTube subscribers. "Zelda lore isn't quite on that level yet, but it does have depth."
For his half-hour analysis of that Tears of the Kingdom preview, King spent more than a dozen hours scrutinizing every frame, even playing the audio backward in search of any messages that could divulge some of the plot points Nintendo closely guards. He also belongs to a Reddit forum where Zelda theorists are attempting to translate hieroglyphics from marketing materials; some of the amateur philologists speculate that the symbols were inspired by Chinese characters or Japanese hiragana.
The video game franchise that started in 1986 with a pixelated map guarded by ghosts and goblins has evolved into an elaborate topography of mountain ridges, coastline villages and enemy hide-outs. The gameplay has also become more riveting, with puzzle-box designs and environmental storytelling that encourage exploration.
But throughout it all, the basic spark of discovery has endured.
The original Legend of Zelda, played by millions on the Nintendo Entertainment System or the company's Famicom console, was the brainchild of Shigeru Miyamoto, who has described Hyrule as "a miniature garden that you can put into a drawer and revisit anytime you like."
Link's initial journey was inspired by Miyamoto's childhood exploration of the idyllic countryside of Japan. His passion for hiking through the mountains and delving into forests was evident in the mysterious nature of Hyrule, which clutched its secrets, encouraging players to burn every bush in hopes of another secret tunnel.
Miyamoto is what some in the video game industry would call a "mechanics guy." When he designs Mario or Zelda titles, he usually focuses on the gameplay first. Beyond some narrative threads relegated to the user manual, only a single screen in the original game provided a rough plot summary about the demon king Ganon, a princess named Zelda and a hero called Link.
But over the past 20 years, the stories have become more nuanced, with a tone and artistic style displaying the influence of the Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki. Link has sailed across the sea, lived above the clouds, transformed into a wolf and even become a train conductor. He has forged the ancient blade of evil's bane and shrunken down to microscopic size.
Another series producer, Eiji Aonuma, has been responsible for scattering the narrative bread crumbs that elevate the Zelda games. "The story is there to give the big world you're in some substance and meat," he told Game Informer in 2017. He tends to keep Link on the archetypal hero's journey, giving the young knight the task of healing the world from a cycle of generational violence.
Aonuma's rise through the corporate ranks of Nintendo has become its own legend. He joined the company, shortly after graduating from Tokyo University of the Arts in 1988, without any experience designing video games. What the young artist did have was a passion for woodwork, and Miyamoto -- who preferred employees with unconventional skills -- was impressed by the intricate puppets Aonuma brought to his interview.
In the late 1990s, Aonuma began working on the Zelda series as a dungeon designer for Ocarina of Time, a Nintendo 64 game that was the franchise's first adventure with 3-D graphics. Those dungeons illustrated Aonuma's penchant for mixing narrative and gameplay. His puzzles were not just a series of rooms, but haunted mansions, secret shrines and the innards of a giant fish.
Ocarina of Time had a grueling two-and-a-half-year development period, and Nintendo spent millions of dollars marketing the title that is now an honored classic. Many players remember stepping onto Hyrule Field the way they recall their first cartwheel.
Wanting to capitalize on the success, Miyamoto greenlit a sequel. But the development team for Majora's Mask was reduced by three-fourths and given only a year to produce something that could match the previous game's quality. The odds of failure seemed high, which encouraged the designers to run with impossible ideas and experiment with darker themes.
Aonuma returned to direct the project with a developer named Yoshiaki Koizumi. The men had attended the wedding of a colleague shortly after the 1998 missile crisis, when North Korea fired a rocket across Japanese territory. That juxtaposition of celebration and fear influenced the game's apocalyptic tone: Link would have three days to prevent the moon from crashing into the world.
It was a much smaller game, with only four dungeons compared with Ocarina's dozen. But developers focused their efforts on intricate side quests in which the player helps townsfolk slightly improve their lives before the impending doom; one climactic plot reunites two lovers so they can exchange vows minutes before moonfall.
Majora's Mask was a smorgasbord for game theorists. Some compared its themes of identity and confusion -- mask-wearing is an important gameplay mechanic -- to Erik Erikson's theory of psychological development. Others say the game's narrative follows the Kübler-Ross model of grief, arguing that Link dies at the very beginning and spends the rest of the game coming to terms with it. Some Zelda fans, however, were dismayed by the emphasis on narrative instead of combat and exploration.
Later Zelda games, such as the acclaimed Twilight Princess, a launch title for the Nintendo Wii, would return to the formula established in Ocarina of Time, with a gameplay loop of clearing dungeons and traversing the overworld with tools like grappling hooks, boomerangs and bombs.
But by the time Skyward Sword was released in 2011, it was clear that the modern Zelda formula was growing stale. Though critics praised its cinematic narrative, there was too much backtracking and hand-holding, with an opening tutorial sequence that lasts for hours. Regions were more generic and largely devoid of life, with the exception of a sky island occupied by a handful of villagers.
Other studios recognized an opportunity and started building their own games in response. Greg Lobanov was just starting his career in the gaming industry around that time, when designers wondered if Nintendo had lost its magic.
"Zelda is the standard unit of measurement in the gaming industry," explained Lobanov, whose 2021 game, Chicory: A Colorful Tale, is heavily based on the series's conventions. "People were really frustrated by the direction."
But Lobanov said that the wildly successful 2017 release of Breath of the Wild, one of the flagship games for the Nintendo Switch, led many developers to scrap their rival projects. The game sold more than 29 million copies, far more than any other entry in the series.
Nintendo had succeeded in recapturing the original Legend of Zelda's joy of exploration, giving Link the new abilities to freely jump and climb walls. Although he remained silent, other characters had fully voiced dialogue for the first time. Traditional dungeons were replaced by puzzles hidden inside four divine beasts and 120 shrines, and 900 scattered Korok seeds gave Link incentive to search the landscape.
"Breath of the Wild was so ambitious," Lobanov said. "It had a clear sense of progression even though it was so open-ended."
The feeling of wonder in Breath of the Wild emerged from a design philosophy that the game's director, Hidemaro Fujibayashi, called "multiplicative gameplay."
During a speech at the 2017 Game Developers Conference, Fujibayashi explained that many previous Zelda puzzles had been based on natural phenomena or simple facts, such as an understanding that exploding a bomb near a cracked wall might open an entrance. A problem would typically have only one solution.
Multiplicative gameplay encourages players to combine actions and objects in ways that allow for a vaster set of solutions. Developers created a prototype to test their theories, recreating the original Legend of Zelda with an interactive environment where the player could burn trees, pick up the logs and then make rafts from the timber. Those mechanics were incorporated into Breath of the Wild, alongside a physics system that allowed players to manipulate rules like the conservation of momentum.
Players spent thousands of hours within this version of Hyrule learning how to exploit the new systems, turning boulders into cannonballs and metal doors into makeshift bridges. Without obvious solutions to puzzles, players were forced to get creative.
"Breath of the Wild brought us back to a kind of playground knowledge where you are trading ideas with other players," said Andrew Shouldice, a developer who last year released Tunic, another game heavily inspired by the Zelda series. "It doesn't feel like the designers are watching you play the game. The world feels real as opposed to this clockwork story where you must turn the crank to make things advance."
Gameplay previews for the sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, indicate that Zelda developers have expanded this system.
Players can expect a dynamic world where bolts of lightning might trigger brush fires that roast the apples on a nearby tree, and the game will also encourage new combinations of weapons and objects. A twig paired with a rock might produce a makeshift mallet. An arrow combined with the eye of a batlike enemy might track enemies like a homing missile.
Zelda theorists like Ed King had a field day as these morsels of information were released, seeming to confirm their speculation that the new game would include story elements that were only hinted at in Breath of the Wild.
The remains of a lost tribe called the Zonai, referenced in the ancient, crumbling ruins scattered throughout Hyrule, were mentioned in the preview. And an artistic style associated with the fictitious tribe is obvious throughout the many sky islands that appear in Tears of the Kingdom.
"The word Zonai is based on an anagram in Japanese for the word 'mystery,' and it was deliberately added to give a sense that something might have come before you," King explained. "If everything is strictly relevant to the plot, you would have the sense that the game world is fake. But evidence of the Zonai makes you feel like it all could be real."

“Ocarina of Time” had a grueling 2-1/2-year development period, and Nintendo spent millions of dollars marketing the title that is now an honored classic. Many players remember stepping onto Hyrule Field the way they recall their first cartwheel.
Wanting to capitalize on the success, Miyamoto greenlit a sequel. But the development team for “Majora’s Mask” was reduced by three-fourths and given only a year to produce something that could match the previous game’s quality. The odds of failure seemed high, which encouraged the designers to run with impossible ideas and experiment with darker themes.
Aonuma returned to direct the project, “Majora’s Mask,” with a developer named Yoshiaki Koizumi. The men had attended the wedding of a colleague shortly after the 1998 missile crisis, when North Korea fired a rocket across Japanese territory. That juxtaposition of celebration and fear influenced the game’s apocalyptic tone: Link would have three days to prevent the moon from crashing into the world.
It was a much smaller game, with only four dungeons compared with the dozen in “Ocarina.” But developers focused their efforts on intricate side quests in which the player helps townsfolk slightly improve their lives before the impending doom; one climactic plot reunites two lovers so they can exchange vows minutes before moonfall.
“Majora’s Mask” was a smorgasbord for game theorists. Some compared its themes of identity and confusion — mask-wearing is an important gameplay mechanic — to Erik Erikson’s theory of psychological development. Others say the game’s narrative follows the Kübler-Ross model of grief, arguing that Link dies at the very beginning and spends the rest of the game coming to terms with it. Some Zelda fans, however, were dismayed by the emphasis on narrative instead of combat and exploration.
Later Zelda games, such as the acclaimed “Twilight Princess,” a launch title for the Nintendo Wii, would return to the formula established in “Ocarina of Time,” with a gameplay loop of clearing dungeons and traversing the overworld with tools such as grappling hooks, boomerangs and bombs.
But by the time “Skyward Sword” was released in 2011, it was clear that the modern Zelda formula was growing stale. Though critics praised its cinematic narrative, there was too much backtracking and hand-holding, with an opening tutorial sequence that lasts for hours. Regions were more generic and largely devoid of life, with the exception of a sky island occupied by a handful of villagers.
Other studios recognized an opportunity and started building their own games in response. Greg Lobanov was just starting his career in the gaming industry around that time, when designers wondered if Nintendo had lost its magic.
“Zelda is the standard unit of measurement in the gaming industry,” explained Lobanov, whose 2021 game, “Chicory: A Colorful Tale,” is heavily based on the series’s conventions. “People were really frustrated by the direction.”
But Lobanov said that the wildly successful 2017 release of “Breath of the Wild,” one of the flagship games for the Nintendo Switch, led many developers to scrap their rival projects. The game sold more than 29 million copies, far more than any other entry in the series.
Nintendo had succeeded in recapturing the original “Legend of Zelda” game’s joy of exploration, giving Link the new abilities to freely jump and climb walls. Although he remained silent, other characters had fully voiced dialogue for the first time. Traditional dungeons were replaced by puzzles hidden inside four divine beasts and 120 shrines, and 900 scattered Korok seeds gave Link incentive to search the landscape.
“‘Breath of the Wild’ was so ambitious,” Lobanov said. “It had a clear sense of progression even though it was so open-ended.”
The feeling of wonder in “Breath of the Wild” emerged from a design philosophy that the game’s director, Hidemaro Fujibayashi, called “multiplicative gameplay.”
During a speech at the 2017 Game Developers Conference, Fujibayashi explained that many previous Zelda puzzles had been based on natural phenomena or simple facts, such as an understanding that exploding a bomb near a cracked wall might open an entrance. A problem would typically have only one solution.
Multiplicative gameplay encourages players to combine actions and objects in ways that allow for a vaster set of solutions. Developers created a prototype to test their theories, recreating the original “Legend of Zelda” game with an interactive environment where the player could burn trees, pick up the logs and then make rafts from the timber. Those mechanics were incorporated into “Breath of the Wild,” alongside a physics system that allowed players to manipulate rules like the conservation of momentum.
Players spent thousands of hours within this version of Hyrule learning how to exploit the new systems, turning boulders into cannonballs and metal doors into makeshift bridges. Without obvious solutions to puzzles, players were forced to get creative.
“‘Breath of the Wild’ brought us back to a kind of playground knowledge where you are trading ideas with other players,” said Andrew Shouldice, a Canadian developer who last year released “Tunic,” another game heavily inspired by the Zelda series. “It doesn’t feel like the designers are watching you play the game. The world feels real as opposed to this clockwork story where you must turn the crank to make things advance.”
Gameplay previews for the sequel, “Tears of the Kingdom,” indicate that Zelda developers have expanded this system.
Players can expect a dynamic world where bolts of lightning might trigger brush fires that roast the apples on a nearby tree, and the game will also encourage new combinations of weapons and objects. A twig paired with a rock might produce a makeshift mallet. An arrow combined with the eye of a batlike enemy might track enemies like a homing missile.
Zelda theorists including Ed King had a field day as these morsels of information were released, seeming to confirm their speculation that the new game would include story elements that were only hinted at in “Breath of the Wild.”
The remains of a lost tribe called the Zonai, referenced in the ancient, crumbling ruins scattered throughout Hyrule, were mentioned in the preview. And an artistic style associated with the fictitious tribe is obvious throughout the many sky islands that appear in “Tears of the Kingdom.”
“The word Zonai is based on an anagram in Japanese for the word ‘mystery,’ and it was deliberately added to give a sense that something might have come before you,” King explained. “If everything is strictly relevant to the plot, you would have the sense that the game world is fake. But evidence of the Zonai makes you feel like it all could be real.”

Full text: The animated film's grosses helped make April the first month to surpass its prepandemic average at the box office.
The animated film "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" crossed the $ 1 billion box-office threshold on Sunday, making it the fifth movie to do so since the start of the pandemic and the surest sign yet that the theatrical movie business is on the rebound after a prolonged downturn.
Despite middling reviews, the Universal Pictures film, which features Chris Pratt as the voice of the beloved video game character Mario, has been in theaters for only 26 days and is now the seventh biggest film in Universal's history, passing both "Jurassic World Dominion" and the animated "Despicable Me" in worldwide box office grosses.
Of the five films to cross the $ 1 billion mark since the pandemic began, "Super Mario" is the first animated one. Geared to families with young children -- and fans of the uber-popular Nintendo video game -- the movie provided a welcome reprieve to theater owners who had been concerned that the family film business was at risk of not returning to prepandemic levels. In fact, "Super Mario" helped push the April domestic box office up 11.5 percent compared with prepandemic levels, according to the box office analyst David A. Gross.
Mr. Gross called the stat "a breakthrough" since it marks the first month that has surpassed its prepandemic average. The 2023 year-to-date box office deficit is now down 21.8 percent compared with that average.
But not everything is coming up roses at the multiplex. The well-reviewed adaptation of Judy Blume's beloved children's novel "Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret" pulled in only $ 6.8 million during its opening weekend. The PG-13 rated film, which cost $ 30 million to make and focuses on the challenges of prepubescent adolescence, was primarily viewed by Lionsgate, the studio behind the film, as a nostalgia play, and it worked in attracting women over 45 who were fans of the 50-year-old novel from their childhood. The company was less successful luring in an audience of teenage girls, but there is hope among box office analysts that strong word-of-mouth will bring in more moviegoers as Mother's Day weekend draws near.
Studios and their theater partners are optimistic about the summer season, which officially begins next weekend, when Disney will debut the third and final film in the "Guardians of the Galaxy" trilogy, directed by James Gunn. The 10th "Fast and Furious" movie will follow, and both movies are expected to be huge hits for May. Also buoying optimism is the array of family films headed to theaters this summer, including the live action adaptation of "Little Mermaid," coming at the end of May, along with Sony Pictures's "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" and Pixar's "Elemental," both headed to theaters in June.

From a Theater Kid in Kansas to Broadway: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Justin Cooley plays an anagram-obsessed, Elvish-speaking high school student in the musical.
Justin Cooley was just moving into a dormitory for his freshman year at Texas Christian University when he got the call: Did he want to forgo the whole college thing and instead take a role in an Off Broadway musical with a strange title and an even stranger subject?
Cooley was an 18-year-old Kansan who had never been to New York, let alone seen a Broadway show, and he had never even worked on a stage production alongside grown-ups.
But opportunity, to quote Stephen Sondheim, is not a lengthy visitor. Cooley grabbed the role, moved to New York, and hit the aspiring-actor jackpot: The musical, "Kimberly Akimbo," transferred to Broadway, where he's featured as an anagram-obsessed, Elvish-speaking, sweetly weird high school student who befriends a teenage girl braving a life-shortening genetic condition while living with a comically dysfunctional family.
"This is not the path I thought I was on," Cooley, now 19, told me over a cheat meal at a Downtown Brooklyn burger-joint-cum-video-game-parlor, 8-Bit Bites, with a retro aesthetic that a publicist suggested as the perfect setting for an interview since Cooley is an avid gamer and "Kimberly Akimbo" is set in 1999.
Full disclosure: I had suggested meeting the actor somewhere that was colorful and relevant and might jostle free some delightful and revealing details for this article, but it turns out that asking for location ideas from a teenager who just moved to New York is not the best strategy. When I got to the restaurant, I learned that Cooley had never been there before. And I'm not a gamer, so the production's fantasy that we would play Super Mario and that would lead to a charming anecdote for this article instead led to, well, whatever this is.
But no worries: It turns out that Cooley is as wide-eyed and winning as his character, Seth, who, despite a serious case of adolescent awkwardness and goofily geeky obsessions, is the most grounded person in a cast of schemers and dreamers, all of whom seem a little lost.
Seth is sort of a stand-in for David Lindsay-Abaire, the Pulitzer-winning playwright ("Rabbit Hole") who wrote "Kimberly Akimbo" two decades ago as a drama, and then, partnering with the composer Jeanine Tesori, adapted it into a musical.
"I've only recently started to admit that Seth is as close as I've ever gotten to putting myself in a play," Lindsay-Abaire said. "That kid is essentially who I was at that age."
Cooley didn't have to dig too deep to find his inner Seth. One detail pretty much tells you all you need to know on that front: He spoke excellent Elvish at his audition. "He nailed it," Lindsay-Abaire said. "Whether he knew Elvish or not, he just went for it, and that was the thing that put it over the top."
Here's Cooley, defending his geek cred over the clamorous strains of Donna Summer and chiptune: "People definitely thought I was weird, because of my eccentric interests. I wore anime shirts, and I was a theater kid, and I was friends with all the girls who had rainbow hair."
He collects manga, has dabbled in Dungeons & Dragons, and is especially fond of old-school Nintendo games -- "your classics, like 'Mario,' 'Kirby,' 'Legend of Zelda,"' he said. "And Pokémon. I've been playing that recently. I've never grown out of those phases, and don't know if I ever will."
Cooley, who finds echoes of his own curiosity in his character, said he also loves the way his casting might upend some stereotypes. "To play the role of Seth as a Black person is just so emotional for me," Cooley said. "To see a Black kid who is weird and loves Dungeons & Dragons and all this nerdy stuff and is highly academic and he's not a class clown, he's not athletic, he's not cool, he's just himself -- that's exactly how I felt growing up."
HOME IS OVERLAND PARK, Kan., where Cooley was a choir kid with no stage experience when the theater program at his suburban high school came looking for Black students willing to join a production of "Hairspray," a musical that concerns race relations. Cooley wound up in the ensemble, and was hooked.
"By my senior year, I realized, I had done so many shows," he said, "and I was like, 'Oh crap, I think I actually want to try doing this as a career."'
He won a prize -- outstanding actor in a lead role -- at the Blue Star Awards, a musical theater competition for Kansas City-area high school students. That, in turn, landed him in the Jimmy Awards, which is the national competition, and though the event was virtual, it was still life-changing: Cooley sang a song from "Tuck Everlasting," and became a finalist.
"With Spotify cast albums, high schoolers these days in musical theater latch on to anything and everything," Cooley said when I asked how he chose "Tuck," which lasted only a month after opening on Broadway. "I've never seen the show, ever. I have no idea what it's actually like. But I love it."
This is the thing to know about the Jimmy Awards: They've become an important pipeline for teenage performers. Casting directors pay close attention, looking for promising talent. And that's what happened to Cooley.
"Justin was really special: he was so vulnerable and so accessible, and even if he didn't have the largest Elphaba range, he was so good," said Bernie Telsey, a powerhouse casting director on Broadway and in Hollywood, and a longtime Jimmy Awards judge.
At first, when Telsey reached out about "Kimberly Akimbo," Cooley demurred. He had a big role in a community theater's student production of "Mamma Mia!" He was sick with mononucleosis. He was overwhelmed.
Telsey persisted, and Cooley reconsidered; he was intrigued by the involvement of Tesori, the show's composer, because he had seen a local production of her Tony-winning work, "Fun Home." "I knew it had to be something good," he said.
So the third time the casting office asked him to audition, he made a tape at home -- his mother read Kimberly's lines, and he performed as Seth. Then came an online callback, a first trip to New York for an in-person audition, and an offer -- for a short run, Off Broadway, but still.
"I was with my mom," he said. "She screamed, and called my dad. I sat down for a sec, and was like, 'No way!"'
He put college on hold. "I deferred for a semester; I told my friends, 'Oh, I'm going to do this fun little show downtown for a bit and then I'll see you all.' No one really knew where it was going."
IT WAS GOING WELL. The show, which opened in a 199-seat theater at the Atlantic Theater Company in late 2021, garnered strong reviews, and announced a Broadway transfer.
"I was like, 'Oh, gosh, I guess I'm not going back to college'," said Cooley, who until his senior year had thought he might try to become a psychiatrist. "'I'm just going to ride with this."'
And it's been quite a ride.
"I wonder how other people my age who come to Broadway deal with it," he said. "I had never done a job outside of a high school setting. And it was a new musical, on top of that, which I had never done, so I had to get used to having my own input, because we were creating a character."
He has turned, often, to the show's star, Victoria Clark, for guidance. She's a 63-year-old Tony winner (for "The Light in the Piazza"), and he's a 19-year-old novice, and in the show they both play high school students who are about 16 years old. "It was incredibly intimidating," Cooley said. "I thought, 'Oh God, she's so experienced. She'll probably be irritated by my amateurness."
Instead, Clark has become some combination of mentor and friend; before each show, the two share a quick hug at the skating rink counter where his character works. "Of course I've felt very maternal toward him, but I've tried to put that aside, and I'm also aware, with my 40-plus years on Justin, that there could be some kind of power dynamic, but I'm super-conscious about that," Clark said. "It wouldn't make any sense to cast someone who was more experienced, because it would seem false, and with Justin there is a truth and beauty to his performance that I have to match. In many ways, he's been my teacher."
The show's director, Jessica Stone, was originally hesitant about casting Cooley, because he was so green, but she said he has been an eager student, at one point pulling her aside to ask the questions he was nervous about asking in front of everyone. And she said the Clark-Cooley dynamic has paid off. "His youth and sweetness and openness, and his lack of the life that weathers us all, washes over Vicki," she said, "and Vicki's years of skill and work and experience wash over Justin."
He's had a lot to learn, and not just about easing up on the burgers and steaming his vocal cords. "I had to learn to feed myself," he said. "How to not stay up late and play video games. It definitely took a step up in maturity for me to be working in the professional world. I'm still figuring out a lot of things."
Tesori remembers a day when she ran into Cooley on his way to Trader Joe's and he blurted out "Hey, how do you cook?"
Cooley is the youngest person in the cast, and that can be isolating. "I'm surrounded by people who are not in the same life stage as me," he said. "Victoria Clark is my best friend. But I'm working on it -- I have a grand total of two friends here, outside of my cast, and that's good for me right now. I'm pretty great with independence and alone time."
In that free time, he draws, practices guitar, and, of course, plays video games. On social media, he sees his friends from home, "in college, at frat parties, and I'm like gosh, I'm drinking tea and going to bed. It's a lot -- a personal journey at a time where I'm obviously still growing and changing every day."
So what's next? He wants to talk composing with Tesori, and writing with Lindsay-Abaire. He thinks about going back to school, but also about sticking with acting. "There's still so much ahead that it can be scary," he said. "This show teaches me every day to not get ahead of myself, and just enjoy now, because there's no gift like the present."

Comedy
'Cherry'
April 28 at 8:30 p.m. at ArtSpace at Public Hotel, 215 Chrystie Street, Manhattan; publichotels.com.
Public Hotel on the Lower East Side served as a hub for the New York Comedy Festival in 2017 and was a home for eclectic comedy experiments before the pandemic. Now its venue ArtSpace is reopening to the public this weekend with "Cherry," a new weekly comedy showcase hosted by Moss Perricone and Chloe Troast.
Perricone has written for "The Other Two," "Beavis and Butt-Head" and "Patriot Act With Hasan Minhaj," while Troast was once a performer for Improv Asylum's "Main Stage Show" and is slated to appear in the film "Sweethearts," as well as the upcoming movie from the comedy trio Please Don't Destroy, of "Saturday Night Live" fame. Coincidental or not, that trio -- Ben Marshall, John Higgins and Martin Herlihy -- will headline the very first "Cherry" on Friday. The lineup will also include Asha Ward and Joyelle Nicole Johnson, with tunes from D.J. Jeremy Elder. Tickets have sold out online, but a limited number will be available for $ 25 at the door.

Outline
April 29 at 8 p.m. at Knockdown Center, 52-19 Flushing Avenue, Queens; knockdown.center.
After a false start in 2020 and a pandemic-induced hiatus, Outline -- the signature offering of the interdisciplinary arts hub Knockdown Center -- has settled into a seasonal cadence and has become catnip for adventurous listeners. This festival returns on Saturday with an intergenerational, international lineup of progressive electronic artists led by Matmos, a duo whose high-concept compositions borrow techniques from musique concrète.
That group shares top billing with Jlin, a producer who concocts shadowy, dense rhythm collages that transcend their typical association with a hip-hop-adjacent variant of house music known as footwork. Other performers include Joe Rainey, a member of the Red Lake Nation who pairs traditional Indigenous music with experimental electronics, and the noise musician Pan Daijing, making her U.S. debut.
Tickets are about $ 36 at dice.fm; a package deal including admission to a second night of Outline programming, on May 13, is also available. OLIVIA HORN
Kevin Sun Quartet
April 27-29 at 7:30 and 9 p.m. at SEEDS Brooklyn, 617 Vanderbilt Avenue, Brooklyn; seedsbrooklyn.org.
The saxophonist and composer Kevin Sun specializes in twisty, inviting small-group post-bop that honors jazz's past while forever plunging into the unexpected. He plays with such communicative power that listeners tend to feel they're making discoveries right along with the band.
Besides mischievous originals like "Kierkegaardashian," Sun's groups, during recent shows at the Jazz Gallery and Brooklyn's Lowlands, have found fresh angles on elliptical Wayne Shorter classics, sacred music from the 15th-century Italian composer Matteo da Perugia, and the video-game soundtracks of Koji Kondo, whose "Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time" theme becomes, in Sun's hands, a spiritual-jazz wonder.
Sun binds that eclecticism into a singular vision. It's ambitious, too: His fifth self-released album will be a two-parter (the first half, "From All This Stillness," is due out on July 7), with compositions of rich rhythmic and harmonic invention. The quartet this weekend includes Christian Li on piano, Walter Stinson on bass and Kayvon Gordon on drums.
Tickets are $ 20 and must be purchased at the door. ALAN SCHERSTUHL
Kids
Family Day: Spring Fest
April 30, noon-4 p.m., Resnick Education Wing, Carnegie Hall, 57th Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan; carnegiehall.org.
Spring has its own soundtrack: bird trills, insect hums, thunderclaps and more. On Sunday, Carnegie Hall is inviting children ages 3 to 10 to explore this music -- and make some of their own -- at Spring Fest.
A free event (admission is first come first served), the program will offer nature-inspired concerts and a Spring Sing. Young participants can also help Michael Hearst and his band investigate real but extraordinary animals, like the elephant shrew and the blue-footed booby, in his performance of "Songs for Unusual Creatures."
A Musical Sound Garden will enable little visitors to emulate the harmonies of the great outdoors with instruments like bongos, maracas and triangles. In "Musical Migrations," an immersive art installation by Yazmany Arboleda, they will decorate local and world maps with yarn, stickers and other materials that represent the rhythms and melodies their families have carried with them. A Sound Journey will envelop young wanderers in a wild symphony created by rain sticks, singing bowls, bird whistles and other elements. And just in case spring needs nudging, the group Bash the Trash will lead a workshop on turning recycled castoffs into instruments like the bloom blower: a horn to awaken flowers. LAUREL GRAEBER
Film
Both Sides of the Camera: Actor/Directors
April 28-May 11 at Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Brooklyn; bam.org.
Jacques Tati's 1967 masterpiece, "Playtime," is partly famous for "Tativille," the gigantic city set that was built for the movie. But that set needed Monsieur Hulot, Tati's onscreen alter ego, to wander through it: As an actor, Tati is a vital component of his film's comedy and mise-en-scène.
Showing on Sunday, "Playtime" is among an eclectic group of movies that the Brooklyn Academy of Music has selected for Both Sides of the Camera, a series on performers doubling as directors (or vice versa). In some cases, the filmmaker's on-camera presence is a given. (See Charlie Chaplin's "The Kid" or Buster Keaton's "Sherlock Jr.," which screen together on May 3.) Sometimes it's more of a signature (Spike Lee as Mookie in "Do the Right Thing," on Saturday). Tati and Jackie Chan (whose "Police Story" is playing on Saturday) had to navigate their ways through impossibly complex visual activity. Dennis Hopper, Barbara Loden and Rainer Werner Fassbinder kept their own counsel playing emotionally volatile characters. Chantal Akerman ("Je Tu Il Elle," on May 7) even captured herself in a groundbreakingly frank sex scene. BEN KENIGSBERG

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mike Cavanagh, now in charge of NBCUniversal, is meeting with talent including Lester Holt and Jimmy Fallon as he ponders next steps for the business.
Since the abrupt ouster on Sunday of NBCUniversal's chief executive, Jeff Shell, the company's at-least-for-now successor has begun settling into the job.
Mr. Shell's acting replacement, Mike Cavanagh, the president of Comcast, which is NBCUniversal's parent, was dispatched from Philadelphia to NBCUniversal's 30 Rockefeller Plaza headquarters this week to meet with dozens of top executives. Mr. Cavanagh has also visited the set of the "Today" show, reached out to news anchors like Lester Holt and met the late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.
But whether Mr. Cavanagh moves into the job permanently, or Comcast eventually chooses someone else for the position, the new leader will be in charge of a business that is the subject of constant rumors and speculation about its future direction, including questions like:
Will Brian Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, combine NBCUniversal with another company, an option he has previously explored?
Will Mr. Roberts pursue a sale or a full acquisition of the streaming service Hulu, which NBCUniversal owns jointly with Disney?
And will the NBC broadcast network give up an hour of its prime-time lineup and hand it over to local affiliates, or begin negotiations for broadcast rights for the National Basketball Association?
NBCUniversal is far from being in dire straits. It is the home of fabled institutions like "Saturday Night Live" and "Today," as well as lucrative franchises like "Despicable Me" and "The Real Housewives." It generated $ 39 billion in revenue last year, a 14 percent increase from the year before.
But the company also owns several cable networks such as USA and Bravo that are hemorrhaging viewers. Its streaming service, Peacock, is growing quickly but still has far fewer subscribers than many of its competitors and is projected to lose $ 3 billion this year.
These issues, which have been looming for months, were brought back to the forefront after Mr. Shell's sudden departure. Comcast announced on Sunday that Mr. Shell was leaving the company after an investigation into a complaint of "inappropriate conduct."
His exit came after Hadley Gamble, a senior international correspondent at CNBC, had filed an internal complaint that leveled accusations of sexual harassment and sex discrimination, according to her lawyer, Suzanne McKie. Comcast executives began an investigation after Ms. Gamble filed the complaint in late March. On Monday, the company said in a filing Mr. Shell had been fired after an investigation corroborated accusations of sexual harassment.
Mr. Roberts and Mr. Cavanagh met with Mr. Shell at the offices of a law firm in Philadelphia on Friday and told Mr. Shell he was being fired, according to two people with knowledge of the internal discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Mr. Shell was taken aback by the sudden turn of events. He had been meeting with lawmakers in Washington, D.C., in the days leading up to his firing, making plans to attend the White House Correspondents' Association dinner on Saturday, according to two people familiar with the matter. He has hired a high-profile crisis communications expert, Risa Heller, and a well-known lawyer.
Mr. Shell declined to comment on the circumstances of his departure but said in a statement that he was "profoundly upset with how much pain and embarrassment I have brought to my family."
"I am solely focused on making amends to them," Mr. Shell said.
Comcast is still looking into elements of Ms. Gamble's complaint related to sexual discrimination, according to two people familiar with the investigation.
Comcast declined to comment on the investigation. Regarding the future of Comcast's leadership, a spokeswoman referred The New York Times to remarks made by Mr. Roberts on Thursday's first-quarter earnings call, calling Mr. Cavanagh "a fantastic executive and operator."
Mr. Roberts has sought to reassure investors since Mr. Shell's departure. On the earnings call on Thursday, he made a brief statement in support of Mr. Cavanagh and NBCUniversal's executives. He praised NBCUniversal's bench of veteran leaders, and said Mr. Cavanagh would "step in at the helm" of the company while remaining president of Comcast after a "tough moment."
Comcast's share price rose about 10 percent after the company's earnings call on Thursday.
In a show of support, Mr. Roberts joined Mr. Cavanagh in New York for NBCUniversal's executive committee meeting, which Mr. Shell used to run, according to three people with knowledge of the gathering. During the meeting, Mr. Cavanagh reassured assembled leaders that he would be there for the foreseeable future. Next week, Mr. Cavanagh is expected to head out to Los Angeles to meet with West Coast executives.
There is a consensus among executives at NBCUniversal that Mr. Shell's departure will not greatly affect the company's TV, film and news assets in the short term. Mr. Shell's biggest decisions needed approval from Mr. Cavanagh and Mr. Roberts, who have final say on the big issues facing the company. "I don't think the business is going to miss a beat," Mr. Cavanagh said during the earnings call.
Even though Mr. Cavanagh has taken the reins, he is unlikely to give up responsibilities across the broader Comcast empire, which includes cable and wireless businesses.
Mr. Cavanagh is widely believed to be the most likely internal candidate to succeed Mr. Roberts. A full-time job running just NBCUniversal would in some ways be a demotion. He is the only president in the company's history who doesn't belong to the Roberts family, which controls Comcast.
Still, some executives at NBCUniversal think the media assets need a dedicated leader. There are too many decisions to be taken across a wide variety of businesses -- including theme parks, film studios and TV programming -- as well as more existential decisions to be made for it to be anyone's part-time job.
Mr. Cavanagh believes that Comcast has a stronger hand than many of its competitors in the media industry, which include Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. Profits from Comcast's broadband and wireless businesses insulate the company somewhat from the ad sales slump affecting many of its peers, giving it cash to invest in streaming.
And NBCUniversal's movie studio and theme parks businesses are growing, with recent bright spots including the opening of "Super Nintendo World" at Universal Studios and the release of "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," which has been a hit at the box office. On Thursday, Comcast said its profits grew slightly in the first quarter despite a decrease in ad revenue and slower growth in its broadband business.
The speculation that Mr. Roberts and Mr. Cavanagh might spin off NBCUniversal has swirled for months, fueled by reports that they considered combining the company with the video game studio Electronic Arts last year. With many of NBCUniversal's rivals teaming up to beef up their streaming businesses, some analysts have speculated that Mr. Roberts and Mr. Cavanagh are hunting for another big deal.
One potential target discussed by analysts is Warner Bros. Discovery, the newly minted media colossus created by the fusion of WarnerMedia -- owner of HBO and the Warner Bros. movie studio -- and Discovery, owner of cable networks like HGTV and TLC.
Craig Moffett, a senior managing director of the SVB MoffettNathanson research firm, said that such a deal could give the combined company enough heft to pay for all the movies and TV shows that would win over enough subscribers to make the service profitable. "But most Comcast investors hate that idea," he added.
"I think Mike will inevitably put his stamp on the business," Mr. Moffett said, "and in this case that inevitably means some role for mergers and acquisitions, or divestitures."

What Won't People Buy In a Bid For the Past: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Just about everyone has somewhere special they went when young, a place that glows in memory. For some it may be a library or game arcade, for others a baseball field or bookstore. For Jay Carlson, growing up in western Massachusetts in the early 1990s, the center of the universe was the video rental store.
This was before streaming, before Netflix, before DVDs. The videocassette player was the summit of consumer technology. At the rental shop, 12-year-old Jay would bump into friends and neighbors, hear about something that couldn't be missed, talk up his own favorites. It was like social media before social media was invented.
He grew up, got married, had children, went to work in the finance department of a retailer. Technology moved on, but his heart did not. One day, he saw in his local comics store a tape of "Ghostbusters," the first movie his parents let him pick out himself. It was $ 7, still sealed from the factory.
"I said to my wife, 'I think I might start collecting tapes,"' Mr. Carlson, 43, said. "I was taking a piece of my childhood back."
Many others are, too. The stock market, real estate and cryptocurrencies did poorly in 2022, but the global luxury goods market grew 20 percent. People may have had less, but they spent more on fine arts and collectibles that serve no function except to provide pleasure.
The culture is bursting with new material -- every day, thousands of new books are published and 100,000 new songs are released on Spotify -- but the old stuff offers a sweeter emotional payoff for many. It could be tapes or posters or pictures or comics or coins or sports cards or memorabilia. It might be from their childhood or the childhood they never had, or it might merely express a longing to be anywhere but 2023.
The common element is this: People like to own a thing from a thing they love. For Mr. Carlson and millions like him, the nostalgia factory is working overtime.
When Mr. Carlson first began to look for sealed VHS cassettes, they were considered so much plastic trash. "Back to the Future," "The Goonies," "Blade Runner," were about $ 20 each on eBay. He put them on a shelf, little windows into his past, and started an Instagram account called Rare and Sealed.
Then tapes began to get scarcer and much more expensive. People trapped at home had lots of money to spend during the pandemic. But it was more than that.
Objects with a bit of history have an obvious attraction in a high-tech world. The current cultural tumult, with its boom in fake images, endless arguments over everything and now the debut of imperious A.I. chatbots, increases the appeal of things that can't be plugged in.
At the same time, advances in technology mean it is ever easier to buy expensive things online. Bids at auctions routinely reach tens, even hundreds, of thousands of dollars.
One thing people are eagerly seeking with the new technology is old technology. Cormac McCarthy's typewriter, which he used to write a shelf of important novels, went for a quarter-million dollars. An Apple 1 computer fetched nearly twice that. A first-generation iPhone, still sealed in its box, sold for $ 21,000 in December and triple that in February.
Blend these factors -- a desire for escape from our virtual lives; bidding as fast as pushing a button; and the promotion of new collecting fields like outdated technology devices -- and you have Heritage Auctions in Dallas.
Heritage is a whirlwind of activity, of passion, of hype, constantly trying new ways of enticing people to own something beautiful and useless. Ninety-one million Americans, according to U.S. Census Bureau surveys, are having trouble paying household bills. Everyone else is a potential bidder.
"There was a point in time when art and collectibles were dominated by old white men," said Josh Benesh, Heritage's chief strategy officer. "I think that has been democratized. And the categories of material for sale have been democratized a lot."
Twenty years ago, Heritage had four categories: coins, comics, movie posters and sports. Now it has more than 50, which generated revenue of $ 1.4 billion last year. Everything, at least in theory, is collectible.
"We don't question the value or legitimacy of a particular subject matter relative to outmoded norms," Mr. Benesh said. "We're not here to tell you what's worthwhile. The marketplace will tell you. The bidders" -- Heritage has 1.6 million -- "will tell you."
VHS tapes were apparently worthwhile. The selection of an expert to run the sales was easy: Mr. Carlson. His first auction, in June 2022, brought in more than a half-million dollars.
The publicity around the sale brought Mr. Carlson, whose email address is on the Heritage website, many offers of tapes. One man said he had put together a time capsule for his son, who was born on Christmas Day 1982. "Rocky III" had just come out, so the father included a brand-new copy. He threw in "Rocky I" and "Rocky II" as well. They'd cost $ 60 each.
The three tapes, all with a factory seal, fetched $ 53,750 in a February auction.
Since cassettes were designed to be played, only a few unopened ones exist 40 years later. But since they were never considered valuable, they might be found anywhere for a pittance.
"A man told us he found a sealed first release of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' at Goodwill," Mr. Carlson said. "He paid a quarter. That will probably go for $ 20,000."
Every potential bidder must decide if this is the 2023 equivalent of Beanie Babies, which flew high and then crashed. Mr. Carlson would not be working at Heritage if he didn't believe.
"These tapes are historical artifacts that have this ability to sweep you back in time to a place that all at once feels miles away and yet somehow like home," he said. "I used to think it was just me, but I talk to more and more people getting into this because of that pull."
The pull of nostalgia is powerful indeed. But the pull of quick cash can be more powerful still. There were 235 lots in February's tape auction, and they all sold.
For those who missed out, dozens of the lots are now highlighted on Heritage's website to suggest the owner might be willing to flip his newly acquired copy of "Caddyshack" for a 50 percent premium.
At Heritage, the bidding never really ends.
Wanted Dead or Alive
The Heritage offices look like a cross between an Amazon warehouse and a very wide-ranging museum, with a dash of "Hoarders" thrown in.
In mid-2020, the privately held company moved to a 160,000-square-foot building by Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, doubling the size of its former headquarters. Hundreds of specialists, most of them collectors themselves, prepare hundreds of thousands of items for bids here -- researching, photographing, writing catalog copy.
There are boxes of Teenage Mutant Turtles Killer Bee toys. A CBS television camera that filmed the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald. A poster from the McKinley campaign in 1896. Lots of Pokémon. Fake newspapers from the HBO series "Watchmen." Lots and lots of comic books. A videocassette of the horror flick "Death Spa." Sneakers. Trading cards.
Stuff overwhelms desks; objects are piled to the ceilings in storage rooms; racks are full of items that have been bought and must be shipped.
The spiritual roots of Heritage, which calls itself "America's auction house," go back to the most primitive type of collector, the souvenir hunter. Anything not nailed down in America, along with quite a bit that is, becomes prey. Traveling through Missouri in 1882, Oscar Wilde noticed a crowd pulling down a little yellow house.
"It is the house of the great train-robber and murderer, Jesse James, who was shot by his pal last week, and the people are relic hunters," the playwright reported. "They sold his dustbin and foot-scraper yesterday at public auction, his door-knocker is to be offered for sale this afternoon, the reserve price being about the income of an English bishop."
Wilde added that Americans "are great hero-worshippers, and always take their heroes from the criminal classes." That's as true as ever. A few months ago, Heritage sold the outlaw's pocket revolver for $ 62,500.
The problem is, older historical items that were previously unknown are becoming rare. Every barn, basement and attic has been ransacked for treasures. New items related to Washington or Lincoln, for instance, are nearly impossible to find.
"All the varieties of Lincoln inaugural buttons seem to be known," said Curtis Lindner, Heritage's director of Americana. "There has not been a new photo of Lincoln in many years. We get a lot of people saying, 'I have a new image.' Unfortunately, not everyone who has a beard is Abraham Lincoln."
So the pressure is on to develop new material. For instance, Vegas casino chips. "People have emotional ties to Vegas," said Ray Farina, who moved over from Americana to develop this niche. "Maybe they saw Elvis there back in the day."
A 1953 chip from the fabled Sands casino sold for $ 12,000 at Heritage in December. Now people with chips are contacting Heritage. A guy says his father worked for the casinos taking the decommissioned chips out to the desert to bury them in concrete. Apparently, he kept some.
"Word gets out," Mr. Farina said. "We have tremendous marketing ability here."
The pace of Heritage's auctions is relentless -- there were 1,034 in 2022, almost three a day, with a total of 412,270 lots -- and so are the Heritage emails promoting them.
Even so, revenue barely inched up in 2022 after growing 60 percent in 2021. The number of registered bidders rose, but only by a small fraction. There may be a limit to what marketing can do.
Looking for a Sure Thing
Sitting in his office on a rainy Monday morning, Chris Ivy, the director of sports auctions at Heritage, is a bit distracted. That's because he is talking about auctions while simultaneously bidding for Heritage on a Michael Jordan jersey being auctioned by a competitor.
Last summer, Heritage sold a Mickey Mantle rookie card for $ 12.6 million, which it billed as the most valuable sports collectible ever sold at auction. The clothing actually worn by players seems to Mr. Ivy undervalued by comparison.
He suspects this Jordan jersey, which is being sold as nothing special, was worn in a game. "It has a downside of maybe $ 5,000 and an upside of $ 100,000. I'll take that every day of the week," he says. "We use our expertise here to help generate income."
Mr. Ivy wins the jersey for about $ 20,000. To try to authenticate it, he will use a photo-matching service, which will scour the internet for proof that it is what he thinks it is. When a historical object is validated with contemporary images, bidders are encouraged.
A recent Heritage auction featured a 1948 Joe DiMaggio jersey. What made it special was the black armband attached to the left sleeve, a tribute to Babe Ruth after his death on Aug. 16 of that year. The Yankees' two greatest stars were thus linked for a few weeks.
The jersey was being sold by a collector, and there was no direct connection to DiMaggio. So Heritage sent photographs of it to Resolution Photomatching in Seattle.
Resolution found a contemporary picture that showed DiMaggio apparently wearing the shirt, although without the mourning band. The tiny imperfections in the flannel were the same. The jersey sold for $ 564,000.
Data can mislead as well as illuminate. Two years ago, an Australian gamer named Karl Jobst released a popular video that made allegations of fraud against Heritage. The company responded that it "has always acted with the utmost integrity and has never falsely inflated the collector video-game marketplace or any other."
At the heart of the accusations is the question of grading. In the 1980s, ratings companies began offering numerical scores for coins at auction. In theory, that meant bidders knew exactly what they were getting without having to examine each lot personally.
Ratings accelerated the development of online auctions, with the practice spreading to sports cards, comic books and, more recently, game cartridges and videotapes. After grading, items are inserted into a hard plastic case to prevent wear. Just like a photo-match, a high grade reassures potential bidders that the object is, indeed, something special.
Then came the Super Mario Bros. game cartridge auctions.
Super Mario is a Nintendo game introduced in the mid-1980s that became a global phenomenon and, this month, a new Hollywood movie. In 2017, an unrated copy of the original game brought in $ 30,000 on eBay, prompting shock and disbelief. Two years later, a cartridge graded 9.4 sold for $ 100,000 to a group that included Jim Halperin, a founder of Heritage. The purchase was used by Heritage to promote its new auction of graded games.
In the summer of 2021, Heritage auctioned a Super Mario cartridge for $ 1.56 million, a tenfold increase in two years and the first game to be sold at auction for more than $ 1 million. It had a grade of 9.8 and was rated A++. The sale made news. In the same auction, a Super Mario was graded at 8.5 and rated A+. It sold for only $ 31,000.
Valarie Spiegel, who oversees video games at Heritage, explained the $ 1.5 million difference: "9.8 is a trophy-level grade," whereas "8.5 is not." Keep in mind this is not about the game itself but, in essence, the tightness of the plastic seal.
Grading, Mr. Jobst points out, is "very subjective by nature." When dealers and collectors get a grade that they think is too low, they simply crack open the plastic case and send the item back to the grading company or a competitor. This is known as "the crack-out game."
Forbes magazine accused Mr. Halperin of doing this with coins in 2004, creating a sort of grade inflation that pushed up prices for unwary bidders. In a lengthy rebuttal that is still on the Heritage website, Mr. Halperin said he publicly encouraged crack-outs by anyone who got a grade they thought too low.
"We sell an item as if it were our own," Mr. Ivy said. "Our question always is, How can we maximize this? The more we get for our consignors, the more money we make."
The Nostalgia Vault
The thrill of a collection is that it is real -- you can take it off the shelf. This is also, of course, the problem with collecting. Collections can easily overwhelm a house, a life.
Several online auction companies have recently announced programs to take care of collections for their owners. Collecting, which gained so much momentum as a response to the virtual, is moving away from its physical reality.
A program being tested at eBay uses a vault in Delaware to store sports cards. Collectors cannot visit their treasures, but eBay will take a photograph of the card and send it to the owner, kind of like seeing your child at summer camp. Beckett, a sports collectible company, has opened a 100,000-square-foot vault in Plano, Texas.
Mr. Carlson, the videocassette expert, is not so sure he would want to use a vault. He likes seeing his tapes too much. In any case, his collection is not growing much these days. He's wrapped up in his job at Heritage. And then there's the problem of money, or lack of it.
"Some of the tapes I like go beyond my budget," he said.

Full text: The Library of Congress has designated 25 recordings, including Madonna's "Like a Virgin," as "audio treasures worthy of preservation for all time."
Super Mario Bros. are currently ruling the box office. Now, they have also been designated an unlikely national treasure by no less than the Library of Congress.
The composer Koji Kondo's 1985 theme for the video game is among the 25 recordings just added to the National Recording Registry, joining Madonna's 1984 album "Like a Virgin," Daddy Yankee's 2004 hit "Gasolina" and some of the earliest known mariachi recordings as "audio treasures worthy of preservation for all time."
The registry, created in 2000, designates recordings that are "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant," and are at least 10 years old. This year's entries were selected from more than 1,100 nominees submitted by the public. They bring the total number of titles on the registry to 625 -- a tiny but elite slice of the nearly 4 million songs, speeches, radio broadcasts, podcasts and other recorded sounds in the library's collection.
This is the first time a video game soundtrack has been selected, according to the library. In the decades since the game's release, Kondo's "jaunty, Latin-influenced melody" (as the library describes it, calling it "the perfect accompaniment to Mario and Luigi's side scrolling hijinks") may have been driven permanently, or perhaps annoyingly, into the collective brain.
But its creator remains relatively unknown. Kondo, who was born and raised in Japan, wrote the ditty -- officially known as "Ground Theme" -- in the 1980s, after seeing a recruiting flyer from Nintendo on a university bulletin board in Osaka.
In a statement, Kondo, 61, who still works for Nintendo, said he was delighted by the designation. "Having this music preserved alongside so many other classic songs is such a great honor," he said. "It's actually a little difficult to believe."
And its significance, according to the library, goes far beyond the song itself, which was inspired in part by the music of the Japanese jazz fusion band T-Square. According to the library, Kondo's soundtrack "helped establish the game's legendary status and proved that the five-channel Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) sound chip was capable of a vast musical complexity and creativity."
This year's list is heavy on familiar pop hits, including Led Zeppelin's single "Stairway to Heaven," Queen Latifah's album "All Hail the Queen," Mariah Carey's single "All I Want for Christmas is You," Jimmy Buffett's "Margaritaville," and John Denver's "Take Me Home, Country Roads."
Many are deemed significant not just for their musical contribution, but for the broader cultural shifts they exemplify. With "Gasolina," the first reggaeton recording on the registry, the library notes that its "aural dominance" ushered in "a full reggaeton explosion and even saw various radio stations switching their formats," including some from English to Spanish.
The earliest item added to the registry is "The Very First Mariachi Recordings," a compilation of recordings (including "The Parakeet") made in 1907-9 by a group from the rural state of Jalisco, Mexico. The four musicians, led by the vihuela player Justo Villa, are credited with having introduced the style of music to the capital city -- and eventually the world -- a few years earlier.
The most recent is the Northwest Chamber Orchestra's recording, released in 2012, of Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's "Concerto for Clarinet and Chamber Orchestra," which was inspired by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The registry also includes some spoken-word recordings. The journalist Dorothy Thompson's radio commentaries on "the European situation," made between Aug. 23 and Sept. 6, 1939, are cited as a "unique broadcast record" of the period right before the outbreak of World War II.
The library's list also recognizes Carl Sagan's "Pale Blue Dot," a short 1994 recording of him explaining the ideas behind his book of the same title. It was inspired by a famous photograph of the Earth taken by the space probe Voyager 1 during its final mission, which Sagan describes as revealing how the Earth was "a mere point in a vast, encompassing cosmos."

'Mario' Film Ignites Hope For Recovery: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The film's blockbuster opening weekend raised hopes that animation, once one of Hollywood's safest bets, had recovered from the pandemic.
Movie theaters have struggled to recover from the pandemic, in part, because the once-reliable family audience has wandered. Last year, family-oriented films -- largely animation -- represented 17 percent of worldwide ticket sales, about half of what they were in 2019.
Over the weekend, however, "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" from Universal Pictures turned out families on a jaw-dropping scale, generating an estimated $ 146.4 million in ticket sales at theaters in the United States and Canada, for a total of $ 204.6 million since arriving on Wednesday. The PG-rated movie cost Illumination Entertainment and Nintendo roughly $ 100 million to make.
"The Super Mario Bros. Movie," about Brooklyn plumbers who get zapped into a magical and treacherous realm known as the Mushroom Kingdom, collected an additional $ 173 million overseas -- a result that one Hollywood trade news site called "plumb insane," noting that it was on a par with results for Universal mega-franchises like "Fast and Furious" and "Jurassic World."
Are family movies back -- all the way back, to the degree that Hollywood can once again count on them as relative sure things?
Studio executives and movie theater owners were practically doing cartwheels over the weekend while shouting, "Yes!"
"This is just extraordinary," Jim Orr, Universal's president of domestic theatrical distribution, said on Sunday. "The numbers just kept growing and growing as the weekend went on."
Box office analysts were more cautious. As the dominant provider of family entertainment, Walt Disney Studios needs to deliver a theatrical animated hit before a true recovery can be declared, said David A. Gross, a film consultant and box office authority. The last five animated movies that Disney has released in theaters have been ticket-selling disappointments. (Those include "Strange World" and "Lightyear" last year, and "Encanto," "Raya and the Last Dragon" and "Ron's Gone Wrong" in 2021, a pandemic-affected year.)
"Still some question marks hanging around family movies," Mr. Gross said in an email. Disney has two animated movies coming up: "Elemental," set in a world where residents are made of fire, water, earth and air, arrives in June; and "Wish," a musical about a young girl and a star that falls from the sky, is due in November.
Taking the children to the movies can be expensive -- as much as $ 110 for a family of four in New York City, and that is without popcorn ( $ 9.29 for a small) or a single soda ( $ 7). Families also became accustomed to watching new animated movies at home during the pandemic, when Disney debuted Pixar films like "Luca," "Turning Red" and "Soul" on its streaming service, bypassing theaters completely. Streaming-service movies are "free," or so it can seem for anyone who already subscribes to Disney+ ( $ 8 a month for the basic version).
For the weekend in North America, "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" was easily No. 1. Second place was a bit of a photo finish, with "John Wick: Chapter 4" (Lionsgate), "Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves" (Paramount) and "Air" (Amazon) each estimated to have collected about $ 14 million.
"Air," directed by Ben Affleck, collected roughly $ 20 million since arriving on Wednesday on 3,500 domestic movie screens, a total that Mr. Gross called "excellent." He noted that sports dramas -- "Air" is about Nike's efforts in the 1980s to lure a young Michael Jordan to its struggling basketball brand -- tended to arrive to about $ 5.4 million in ticket sales.
The turnout for "Air" validated Amazon's decision to release the well-reviewed film in theaters, where it will play exclusively for at least a month before becoming available on the company's Prime Video streaming service. For deep-pocketed Amazon, the theatrical release is something of a loss leader -- a way for Prime Video to compete for top talent, who want their films seen on big screens. Analysts estimated that Amazon paid $ 130 million for the rights to "Air" and spent an additional $ 50 million on marketing.
"Air" is the first movie from Artists Equity, a production company formed by Mr. Affleck, Matt Damon and RedBird Capital.
But the weekend belonged to "The Super Mario Bros. Movie." Among certain demographics, the film felt like a cultural event, or what Mr. Gross called "moviegoing urgency in action." That was no accident: Marketers at Universal carpet-bombed televised sporting events (March Madness, N.F.L. championship games, the N.B.A. All-Star Game, the Super Bowl) with promos and orchestrated a stunt on "The Tonight Show" in which members of the movie's voice cast (Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Keegan-Michael Key) sang the Mario theme song.
Universal's theme parks around the world helped stoke the fire. Universal Studios Hollywood recently opened Super Nintendo World, a lavishly themed expansion that features the Brothers Mario. The attraction has been a runaway success, with early-entry tickets sold out every day since it opened on Feb. 17.
Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst, noted that "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" delivered the biggest opening on record for an animated film that's not a sequel, dethroning "The Secret Life of Pets" (2016), and the second-biggest opening on record for an animated movie. "Incredibles 2" (Disney-Pixar) ranks as No. 1, having collected $ 183 million over its first three days in 2018.
Universal has transformed itself into an animation superpower under the leadership of its chairwoman, Donna Langley. She oversees two cartoon factories: Illumination, founded by Chris Meledandri ("Despicable Me," "Ice Age"), and DreamWorks Animation, which made "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish," an Oscar-nominated sequel that arrived to a paltry $ 12.4 million in ticket sales in December and ultimately collected $ 480 million worldwide. Universal's upcoming animated films include "Strays," an R-rated canine comedy scheduled for theatrical release in June. The studio is also working to reboot the "Shrek" franchise.
"The Super Mario Bros. Movie" received mixed to negative reviews. But its instant success among ticket buyers -- who gave the film an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls -- adds to a recent trend in Hollywood: Studios, scrounging for established, globally appealing intellectual property, seem to have finally cracked the code on adapting video games for the big screen.
The movie industry's troubled history with the genre started 30 years ago, when the first video game-based movie, "Super Mario Bros.," became a hall-of-fame misfire. In recent years, studios have become newly enamored with game adaptations, leading to successes like "Sonic the Hedgehog" (Paramount) and "Pokémon Detective Pikachu" (Warner Bros.). On television, "The Last of Us" (HBO) and "The Witcher" (Netflix) are game-based hits.
Mr. Orr, the Universal distribution president, noted that "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," which played in 3,343 theaters in the United States and Canada, benefited from nostalgia. Nintendo introduced its Mario Bros. games in the 1980s. About 26 percent of the weekend audience was older than 35.
"Illumination and Nintendo collaborated to make a movie that fans love," Mr. Orr said. "People wanted to come out and be fully entertained by these characters they have known for decades."

It Bombed in 1993. For a New Generation, It's a Hit.: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A critical and commercial disaster in its day, the video-game adaptation was trashed even by its star, Bob Hoskins. But a reappraisal is underway.
The new animated film "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" recreates the sunny spirit, effervescent action and confectionary aesthetic of the namesake video games, with the voices of Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Jack Black as Bowser, and Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach. Expect periwinkle skies, green warp pipes and squeaky-voiced, mushroom-headed characters.
The mustachioed Nintendo mascot has been on the big screen before -- even though some of the people involved would prefer to forget about it.
Way back in 1993, the popularity of Super Mario led to Hollywood's first big-budget video game adaptation. The live-action "Super Mario Bros." starred Bob Hoskins as Mario and John Leguizamo as Luigi, two down-on-their-luck plumber brothers picking up odd jobs in Brooklyn. Largely shot in an abandoned cement factory in North Carolina, the movie was mostly set not in the hyper-colored Mushroom Kingdom, but in a grody, dystopian alternate version of New York called Dinohattan, ruled over by the maniacal dictator King Koopa (Dennis Hopper). Sticky, elastic fungus plays a key role in the plot. It looked and felt nothing like the video games.
To Rocky Morton, who directed the movie with Annabel Jankel, that was the point. Morton and Jankel were British music video filmmakers who also had been behind the creation of the pseudo-computer-generated TV show host Max Headroom. Morton and Jankel's agent had sent them a Mario Bros. movie script by the "Rain Man" co-writer Barry Morrow. Dismissing that screenplay as too cute, Morton pitched another idea: a darker, grittier Mario Bros. origin story.
"It felt like such a great opportunity," Morton said in a recent phone interview, of turning the video game phenomenon into a movie. "It seemed like the obvious thing to do. And it would have a built-in audience. It was made in heaven."
The result was a critical and commercial disaster. Roger Ebert declared it "a complete waste of time and money." (Though Gene Siskel allowed, "I like the Goombas," referring to Koopa's oversized henchmen.) Several of the actors spoke disparagingly about the production, with Hoskins calling the shoot a "nightmare." It was game over for any sequel, and for the Hollywood careers of its directors too.
In more recent years, millennial Nintendophiles who were put off by the movie in 1993 -- or, like me, simply avoided it -- have given it another chance.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Today, "Super Mario Bros." has been the subject of something of a reappraisal, achieving a surprising cult status in the process. Its listing on the cinephile movie rating site Letterboxd is accompanied by a host of passionate, discerning reviews. "Super Mario Bros." is "film-literate, daring, political, and unapologetically insane," wrote the user Zeke Knott. While awaiting the coming fan-made documentary, "Trust the Fungus: Bob-Omb to Cult Classic," fans can listen to a podcast dedicated to a minute-by-minute dissection of the movie, or visit the National Videogame Museum in Frisco, Texas, which is holding an exhibition on it. This month, Nitehawk Cinemas in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, will screen "Super Mario Bros." as part of Re-Consider This!, a series showcasing misunderstood masterpieces.
The excessive artistic license taken with the adaptation is part of the fun of it, said Desmond Thorne, a film programmer at Nitehawk. "In an age when we're inundated with video game and comic book adaptations that take a more literal approach, it's refreshing to look back at 'Super Mario Bros.' 30 years later," he said. "You have to admire the huge swings that it took." For "huge swings," see, for example, the scene in which Dennis Hopper takes a mud bath with Fiona Shaw.
But even the most ardent fans will admit that "Super Mario Bros." is kind of a mess. Morton said the problems began after Disney purchased the distribution rights, demanding an extensive rewrite of the screenplay -- less effects-heavy, more family-friendly -- that arrived 10 days before principal photography began. (Disney was unable to locate anyone involved in the production for comment.)
But it's a fantastic and inspired mess with densely artificial sets concocted by the "Blade Runner" production designer David L. Snyder; cartoonish costumes by Joseph Porro (who most recently worked on "The Mandalorian"); and a lunatic score by the composer Alan Silvestri. Elsewhere, Patrick Tatopoulos's creature designs anticipate his work on "Independence Day."
"The film is such a kitchen sink in terms of inspiration and execution," the superfan Ryan Hoss said. "Practical sets, makeup, costumes, pyrotechnics, prosthetics, animatronics and puppets. It has tone issues, and too many cooks in the kitchen, but you can point to any part of the story of 'Super Mario Bros.' and it's fascinating to someone on some level."
In 2007, when Hoss was in college, he created the website Super Mario Bros. The Movie Archive. "I felt that the conversation around the film just wasn't what it deserved," he said. The site was "a place to get as much of the background and history of the film out in the open."
Since then, Hoss, along with the site's editor in chief, Steven Applebaum, has tracked down alternate versions of the script, set photos, and props, and published numerous interviews with crew members. Most recently, they uncovered and restored an early work print of the film, creating an extended edition available to watch online.
They've also held screenings and other events for like-minded fans. "It's one of the most enthusiastic and positive fandoms I've ever seen," Hoss said.
He added, "The biggest surprise has been getting to know so many of the talented cast and crew that worked on the film. They've all said that 'Super Mario Bros.' was one of the most memorable films of their career."
Leguizamo has said he's proud to have been involved in the film. "I'm O.G.," he told IndieWire recently, also praising Jankel and Morton for their commitment to diverse casting. They "fought really hard for me to be the lead because I was a Latin man," he said. "It was such a breakthrough."
Today, Morton looks back at the whole experience as one of utter humiliation. "It was horrible, just a really horrible experience." (Jankel did not respond to an interview request and apparently has not participated in any stories about the making of the movie. "It really did affect her," said Morton.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The re-evaluation of "Super Mario Bros." is "heartening," said Morton. And yet, the fact that the once-reviled movie is being celebrated and enjoyed -- without irony -- doesn't seem to have sunk in for its director. The day after our interview, he agreed to attend a Hollywood screening of the movie, his first time seeing it in about 20 years. "They wanted me to introduce it but I can't think of anything positive to say."
As for the new film, if all goes well, it might signal the launch of yet another movie franchise, the Nintendo Cinematic Universe. Which, Morton admitted, is probably what audiences expected 30 years ago. "That's the film that everybody wanted," he said. "And they've got it now."

Full text: A famed video game character side-scrolls once again to the big screen in this bland, witless and flagrantly pandering animated comedy.
One thing every great Mario game has in common, from 2D classics like Super Mario World to seminal 3D installments like Super Mario 64 or the recent Nintendo Switch masterpiece Super Mario Odyssey, is a certain effortless charisma. No convoluted backstory, no sardonic attitude, no pretension whatsoever: just easy, straightforward video game fun, elevated by splashy visuals, tight controls and an attention to detail that borders on perfectionism.
Illumination and Universal's "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," the second attempt at a big-screen adaptation of the game franchise after the woefully unsuccessful "Super Mario Bros." (1993), gets many things about Mario right, often painstakingly so. The Mushroom Kingdom, the magical land in which the film is largely set, looks pretty much exactly like the Mushroom Kingdom of the games. Fireflowers, super stars and question mark boxes all look, sound and function like they're supposed to, and when the notoriously vexing blue shell makes a fan-baiting appearance, it spins, crashes and explodes in a way precisely faithful to the source material. Even Mario (a grating, unctuous Chris Pratt), who doesn't sound like the Mario of the games, still manages to invoke trademark catchphrases like "it's a-me" and "let's a-go."
But while the details are meticulous, the attitude is all wrong, trading the simple, unaffected charm that has served the character so well since his introduction in 1981 for a snarky and fatuous air that leans hard on winking humor and bland, hackneyed irony. This is Mario in the Marvel mold: every line a punchline, every gag an arcane meta reference for the nerds who can't get enough of that sort of thing. Served some spaghetti with mushrooms, Mario winces and says he hates mushrooms. Because in the game he's always eating mushrooms, you see. Sound like fun yet?

In this rendition, directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, Mario and his cowardly younger brother, Luigi (Charlie Day), are upstart plumbers from Brooklyn who, for reasons that feel both unnecessarily complicated and curiously underexplained, are zapped into the fantastical world of Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) and the nefarious Bowser (Jack Black). Much of what transpires has some basis in the original games, in a way that often feels oppressively pandering, and the movie's commitment to fan service frequently results in baffling decisions in the context of the film. When Mario recruits Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) to take on Bowser's army, they elect to travel via go-kart. Are go-karts inherently interesting or compelling? No. Is there any logical reason why they would use go-karts? No. But there are go-karts in the video game Mario Kart, so in karts they go.
Every level of the original Super Mario Bros. ends with an apology that has become one of the game's most enduring catchphrases: "Our princess is in another castle." In "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," it's deployed as a flat, mirthless inside joke -- another pat reference, unfunny and predictable, charged with a yawning desperation to please. It doesn't seem right that the spirit of such a pure and exuberant character should be reduced to something so flippant and basically cynical. And though every conceivable effort has been taken to make this "Mario" as Mario-like as possible, the attitude is antithetical to exactly what the franchise so wholesomely represents.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Morgan Maher's new book, "Girls in Bed," captures a young generation of creative talent in confidently vulnerable images.
LOS ANGELES -- Last December, the photographer Morgan Maher was crashing at a friend's house in the Silver Lake neighborhood, and she'd made the living room space fully her own.
Splayed out on a wide countertop was an array of vintage magazines: 1990s editions of The Face with Winona Ryder and Liv Tyler on the cover, the infamous "Gossip Girl" cover of Rolling Stone featuring Blake Lively and Leighton Meester sharing an ice cream cone.
And splayed on another part of the countertop was the first batch of images that was to make up "Girls in Bed," a photo book that Ms. Maher was preparing for a February release. Here were 100 or so shots of young women -- many of them Ms. Maher's friends -- photographed on a white sheet-covered bed (hers, generally). The photos, like much of the work Ms. Maher had been posting to Instagram over the prior couple of years, were playful, deceptively casual, revealing and patient. Her subjects were both appealingly unvarnished and radiating a sense of purpose.
"What I love and what I'm so interested in is the teenage girl experience or what it means to be a young woman today," said Ms. Maher, 27, wearing her trademark oversize librarian glasses and bright red lipstick. "And I feel like women experiencing pleasure and honesty and a real intimate connection with someone, which happens inherently in the bedroom, is something that's not totally presented on the internet."
Work of this nature has become Ms. Maher's calling card, and "Girls in Bed," released through the New York imprint Friend Editions, is the fullest exponent of her approach yet. It also establishes her as the de facto house photographer for a rising generation of young women emerging as pacesetters in film and television (Rachel Sennott, Lukita Maxwell, Zelda Barnz), fashion (Michelle Li, Salem Mitchell), music (Harmony Tividad, Sabrina Fuentes) and others in that nebulous pool of online fame that spans cool-girl Instagram notoriety (Gabrielle Richardson), YouTube renown (Enya Umanzor, Orion Carloto) and celebrity parentage (Stella Rose Gahan).
So much of portrait photography boils down to trust, and the consistency in Ms. Maher's images suggests a gift for connection that long predates the introduction of the camera. All together, the book blurs the line between the professional and the private, coming off like a more artistic and more insider take on the young Hollywood photo spreads that often pepper mainstream celebrity magazines, for a generation that understands that online vulnerability is no obstacle to creative-class professional ascendance.
Born and raised in Frederick, Md., to a military father and a stay-at-home mother, Ms. Maher learned to see herself through the camera starting in her early teenage years, photographing herself in the outfits she was planning to wear all week, then taping up the pictures on her wall for reference.
"I remember being a 16-year-old girl reading like J-14 or whatever, flipping through it, and it was just so not realistic to anything that I was experiencing," she said. "And I would go to the internet, I would go to Tumblr and I would make pen pals and I would find my references that way."
After graduating from Savannah College of Art and Design in 2016, she moved to New York and worked in creative capacities for Marc Jacobs and Tory Burch, as well as for a casting director who worked for Marc Jacobs, Sies Marjan, Miu Miu, Bottega Veneta and Celine.
"I don't want to sound ungrateful, but I learned so much, and also learned so much of what I never want to do," Ms. Maher said of the three years she spent in the casting world. "I think that's also why I became interested in creating work like this, because when I was in casting, and I was the same age as all of these girls that were being ripped out of their homes because they're told they're the prettiest person on the planet, but they're also being totally dehumanized on the way."
"Those experiences have formed her approach, which she described as "intimacy sculpting," serving as an informal BFF and therapist on shoots.
"The way she is as a person is the way she shoots," said Ms. Sennott, the star of "Shiva Baby" and "Bodies Bodies Bodies." "She makes this fun, freeing environment that allows you to enjoy yourself in a space that can sometimes be vulnerable."
Ms. Maher views her work as a kind of restoration of innocence, especially for young women who so often are disempowered in their professional environs. Her lens serves as a tool of repair.
"There's always kind of this trauma conversation that comes into play when we're talking," Ms. Maher said. "And it's just so interesting the amount of women that are like, yeah, something horrible has happened to me. And so I feel like there is safety with the women that I photograph. I just want to be as nice and real and human as possible."
Ms. Maher also frequently makes herself her own subject, leveling the field between observer and observed. "I think as a woman working in a creative field, posting face typically is good for building an audience for your work," said Biz Sherbert, a writer on internet culture and a host of the Nymphet Alumni podcast. "But it makes it clear that she is part of her own universe. She is one of the girls in bed."
Ms. Maher cited as influences Lauren Greenfield's hyper-real portraits of young, unbothered-but-trying-hard young women in "Girl Culture," and also Justine Kurland's book "Girl Pictures," a series of naturalistic images of young women tenderly cutting loose.
Ms. Maher's work also has quite a bit in common with the exuberantly playful celebrity photography of Peggy Sirota, who for the last few decades has made some of the world's most famous people seem eminently approachable.
Her photos also recall the early work of Petra Collins, who made dramatic theater of candid girlhood, and there are echoes of Richard Kern (who Ms. Collins once assisted), who is known for his crisply erotic portraits of young women. Ms. Maher is mindful of these consonances and trying to reset who is doing the gazing.
"I grapple with Richard Kern's work," she said, adding that some of her friends have had positive experiences shooting with him. "Some of that work lacks emotion," she continued. "It's sterile and calculated. It doesn't feel like there's anything behind their eyes. I'm very curious about what the person in front of the camera has to say."
Ms. Sherbert noted how that generation of images looked in the rear view: "Is it an aesthetic? Or is it a power relationship between the person behind that camera and in front of the camera?"
Last June, in need of a refresh, Ms. Maher moved to Los Angeles, falling in with a circle of young women in the entertainment world. Opportunities for commercial work soon followed. She recently shot Ms. Sennott for a Calvin Klein campaign, and Emma Chamberlain for Aritzia. She shoots for Sofia Wine, Sofia Coppola's wine brand. ("I love Sofia Coppola, and the fact that she says that she loves my pictures makes you want to die, or like DMs me, I'm like, I can die now.")
The shoe designer Nicole Saldaña recently hired Ms. Maher to photograph a digital campaign. Ms. Saldaña wanted the imagery to feel like "a girl was sharing her favorite style in her bedroom," she said. "I did give her carte blanche to take images that felt organic." The photos, coy but focused, felt like a natural extension of the "Girls in Bed" series.
On a snowy Monday night in late February, Ms. Maher celebrated the release of "Girls in Bed" with an installation and party at Lubov, a gallery in New York's Chinatown. In the main room, people swilled beers and looked at some of the photos from the book, which had been printed and framed. But Ms. Maher also had the images made into slides and a projector was displaying them, huge size, on a wall in a back room.
Taken in this way, some patterns emerged. Many of the subjects stretched and sprawled beyond the frame, suggesting the scope of their corporeal ambition and an eagerness to connect to the outside world. It was also clear that the bed as a space meant something different to each subject. For some it was a retreat, for some a playpen. The photos allude to friskiness but don't rely on it for their conversational power.
"A lot of times women are just sexy," Ms. Sherbert said. "Her photos aren't annotating that too much."
No one appeared shy, but no one appeared terribly preoccupied with the camera, despite persistent eye contact.
"I feel like the eye contact feels like consensual and empowering, like they're owning the fact that they're in the photograph," Ms. Maher said. She pointed to the number of photos with the subjects laying prone on their backs.
"The most vulnerable," she said. "That's really exciting to be able to create that because it's, like, you're safe. You're feeling safe enough to be portrayed as beautiful as you are, as real as you are."

How Tetris Captivated Us All: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Rotating a colorful shape before slotting it into the perfect position is such a satisfying experience that Tetris has joined chess in the pantheon of universally recognizable games.
Less familiar is the true story of how a prototype created in 1984 by a software engineer for the Soviet Union's Academy of Sciences ended up reaching millions of players across the world. The movie "Tetris," which stars Taron Egerton and was released on Apple TV+ on Friday, explores those humble beginnings.
The addictively simple puzzle game features seven uniquely shaped pieces, each composed of four square blocks. Players move, rotate and position the pieces to form solid lines, which are then cleared away, allowing for potentially endless play. The game's name -- derived from the words "tetra" (Greek for "four") and "tennis" (the sport enjoyed by the game's creator, Alexey Pajitnov) -- has even pervaded culture as a verb, like when you "Tetris" your luggage into the overhead bin on a plane.
In an interview with The New York Times, Pajitnov described Tetris as "the game which appeals to everyone" and said he hoped that its future included e-sports and the integration of artificial intelligence. He is also working on making "a very good" two-player version of the game but said "we are not there yet."
Before Tetris was able to cement itself as a household name with releases on consoles like the Nintendo Game Boy, Henk Rogers, the character played by Egerton, had to journey to the Soviet Union and fend off competitors to secure the game's rights. As the film shows, that was an arduous task that paid off immensely.
Here are more details about the game's creation and why it has resonated with so many for so long:
The Nintendo Game Boy
In the nearly four decades since Pajitnov created Tetris using the Pascal programming language on the Electronika 60, a Soviet-made computer, more than 215 officially recognized versions of Tetris have been released.
Perhaps the most notable variant is the one that was packaged with each copy of the Nintendo Game Boy when the hand-held gaming console was released in 1989. But that incredibly successful pairing -- the Game Boy and the Game Boy Color have combined for about 120 million unit sales -- almost didn't happen.
The president of Nintendo of America, Minoru Arakawa, initially wanted to bundle Super Mario Land with the Game Boy, following the company's success packaging Super Mario Bros. with the Nintendo Entertainment System. Rogers, however, was able to convince Arakawa that Tetris should be included instead, in part because it would appeal to a broader group of demographics.
Pajitnov described the partnership as "two creatures created for each other: Game Boy for Tetris and Tetris for the Game Boy."
The Tetris Effect
As anybody who has spent hours playing Tetris knows, it is an incredibly addictive game. Many people who play for extended periods of time have reported seeing Tetris pieces outside of the game, such as in their mind when they close their eyes, or in their dreams. It's a phenomenon known as the Tetris Effect.
You may have experienced the Tetris Effect yourself if you've ever seen tetrominoes, officially known as Tetriminos, when you're trying to bag your groceries.
In professional studies, the psychologist Richard Haier found that regularly playing Tetris resulted in an increased thickness of the cerebral cortex. Haier's studies also demonstrated how Tetris can affect the plasticity of cortical gray matter, potentially enhancing a person's memory capacity and promoting motor and cognitive development.
A study in 2017 by researchers at Oxford University and the Karolinska Institutet showed that Tetris had the potential to provide relief for people with post-traumatic stress disorder, if they played the game after an incident while recalling a stressful memory.
The Quest for Perfection
Decades after it was invented, Tetris continues to have staying power. Newer versions of the game include Tetris Effect, which builds a Zen experience via music, and Tetris 99, in which players try to outlast opponents who are meddling with their boards.
In competitive play, new methods of moving the pieces are still being discovered. The standard way to play the Nintendo Entertainment System version of Tetris -- yes, the game first released in 1989 is still used at the Classic Tetris World Championships -- is by holding the gray rectangular controller so that the left hand controls the movement of the pieces, and the right hand manages the rotation. But that method, known as "delayed auto shift" in the competitive community, has been usurped in recent years by "hypertapping" and "rolling."
Hypertapping involves rapidly pressing the buttons, countering the traditional sensation that pieces are slowly being dragged into position. Rolling lets pieces be moved even more quickly, by flicking the fingers of one hand along the back of the controller.
The power of hypertapping became clear in 2018, when a 16-year-old named Joseph Saelee used the method to defeat Jonas Neubauer, a seven-time world champion. But in the years since, the rolling method has dominated the competitive scene. Not only is it incredibly effective, but it seems to be less strenuous on fingers and hands.

Painter, Would-Be Cult Leader and Mystery: [Metropolitan]

Full text: Lester Chanin was asleep the night that the paintings were taken. He was only 15 and, though it happened over 50 years ago, he still remembers waking the next day to a world that seemed irrevocably changed.
The painter, his uncle Bradford Boobis, had died hours earlier, an event Mr. Chanin described in a recent interview as like a "meteor dropping out of space."
Then the paintings disappeared.
"It blew the family up," Mr. Chanin said.
There's a good chance you've never heard of Bradford Boobis. A tall man whose chiseled face was framed by a fluffed pompadour, Boobis was, to all appearances, a colorful eccentric and minor celebrity. But to his family and followers, he was a towering figure -- the sun around which the family orbited, according to Mr. Chanin.
Boobis had also, in his later life, started courting followers to a cultlike philosophical movement which he called Life, Infinity, Man (LIM). The philosophy was rooted in humanism and considered the "works of man" -- such as fine art and scientific discoveries -- to be holy. According to his followers, Boobis's own paintings fit that criteria and by extension, so did he.
The self-taught painter received high praise in a 1969 edition of American Artist magazine: "His work indicates that he has thoroughly mastered oil technique, draughtsmanship and craftsmanship." Talented as he was with a brush, though, Boobis was most skilled in the art of shaping his own mythos. "Bradford Boobis," read a self-published pamphlet biography, "is emerging as the greatest artist of our time."
Boobis had limited success in the traditional art world, though he had earned enough acclaim to have once appeared on "The Steve Allen Show" for a stunt in which he painted a portrait of the show's host over the course of a week.
"An amazing giant of a personality," Louis K. Meisel, who represented Boobis and displayed his paintings in his gallery, said of the man in a 2009 interview for the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.
Boobis died of a heart attack in 1972 at 44, leaving behind his wife, Shawn, and two children. That evening, according to family lore, four of his most dedicated devotees let themselves into Boobis's studio on Central Park West, and three of them surreptitiously removed roughly a dozen of his paintings, which depicted naked figures amid distorted surroundings.
Boobis's sudden death was an enormous blow to his family. Mr. Chanin, then an impressionable and admiring teenager, felt it profoundly, as if the life force of his universe had been extinguished.
"He was kind of like a god," Mr. Chanin, 66, said recently. "We all kind of grew up thinking we were part of, like, the royal family or something. We just felt special." This sense of exceptionalism, he explained, emanated from Boobis. "We felt like we came from this extraordinary background and had extraordinary genes, or whatever it was," he said, "mostly by dint of my uncle Brad."
The disappearance of the paintings only compounded this sense of loss for Mr. Chanin. It was a feeling that would calcify over time into an obsession.
Rise of the artist
Bradford Boobis was born in 1927 with the name Milton Boobis. He was the sixth of seven children of Pearl and Benjamin, a pair of immigrants from what is now Ukraine who moved to New York in the early 1900s. Benjamin, a jeweler, eventually went blind and, unable to do his work, died in 1960 after taking cyanide, Mr. Chanin said. At 3, Milton survived a bout with rheumatic fever but complications from the condition left him with an accelerated heartbeat. He grew up with a sense that time is fragile, the sand in his hourglass falling at a faster rate than that of most. "He knew he might die young," his son, Barry, recalled.
Young Boobis spoke quickly and confidently, often in bold, declarative statements. While his siblings despised their last name and later pushed to legally change it, Barry said, Milton instead changed his first name. By the time he moved out of his parents' house, at age 27, he would be Bradford Boobis.
Not long after his 18th birthday, with the United States embroiled in World War II, Boobis enlisted in the U.S. Army, where he formed a friendship with a man named Larry Chanin. After the war, Chanin started dating Boobis's sister Zelda (she later changed her name to Barbara). Bradford, who planned to marry his girlfriend Sylvia Dworkin (she later changed her name to Shawn), encouraged Larry to marry Zelda. Once both couples were married, the four of them moved in together into a sprawling apartment on Riverside Drive in Manhattan.
Both couples had children and eventually moved into separate apartments. Lester Chanin was born in 1956 to Larry and Barbara. In 1961, Bradford's youngest son, Billy, died of spinal meningitis at age 3 and, in his grief, Bradford moved his family to Los Angeles.
Mr. Chanin was 9 when Bradford returned to New York after something of a star turn in Southern California: In addition to his appearance on "The Steve Allen Show," he wrote music for Connie Francis, among others.
Perhaps none of the younger members of the Boobis family were more drawn to Bradford than Mr. Chanin, who had a strained relationship with his own father. Larry, who also worked in the art world, would call his son an "ooglie," a made-up word meant to describe the slimy creatures that would crawl out from under rocks in Central Park at night. "He never gave me any support," Mr. Chanin said of his father. "Never threw a ball to me. Never took me to a ballgame."
Boobis was also working on a new series of large-scale paintings, inspired by the pain of Billy's death: "Life and Death of a Little Sun," painted circa 1970, depicts Boobis reaching for Billy amid green swirls. Three of Boobis's works were selected by the Metropolitan Museum of Art to be displayed at the now-defunct Library of Presidential Papers, making him the only living artist represented at the time, according to the 1969 American Artist piece, which also noted Boobis was scheduled to hold one-man exhibitions at the State Museums of Moscow and Leningrad that year. Barry says now that his father once refused a six-figure offer for one of his paintings, preferring for them to be kept together.
A cult conceived and a growing obsession
As his reputation as a painter increased, Boobis was also starting to court people to what Mr. Chanin referred to as a "cult."
Boobis envisioned one day building elaborate LIM temples that would be decorated with great art, including his own paintings. The temples would feature an "eternal flame" meant to symbolize mankind's creative spirit. Upon entry, visitors would strip naked and light their own torches with the flame, symbolically joining in the eternal flow of the creative spirit.
It is unknown how many followers Boobis had amassed at the time of his death, though Mr. Chanin estimated it was a "very small number." His most ardent supporters included Mr. Chanin's parents, Boobis's mistress and a man in London to whom the paintings were sent, Mr. Chanin said, but there is no available documentation of official meetings. Boobis's wife did not appear to be involved in LIM.
To Boobis's followers, his paintings held a spiritual significance. His plan, according to Barry, was for the paintings to be kept together for posterity. But fearing that his widow might sell them, his followers had moved quickly to spirit them away and ship them to an unknown destination.
LIM ended after Boobis's death. The family, at least to Mr. Chanin, seemed adrift. After the paintings' disappearance, he couldn't reconcile the absence of his uncle, who had once loomed so large, in the world.
"His reputation disappeared. Nothing," Mr. Chanin said. "Like all of that magic -- he was a magic man. Magic! And it was gone, absolutely gone, overnight."
A few years later, in his early 20s, Mr. Chanin became close to Barry, his cousin. Barry persuaded him to pursue art and, after dropping out of SUNY New Paltz, Mr. Chanin moved in with Barry. Like their fathers, they moved into an apartment on Riverside Drive.
Mr. Chanin soon found himself as enthralled with Barry as he had been with his father. "My whole meaning of life revolved around Barry," he said. "I became his follower. His disciple."
Like his father, Barry had personal charisma and experienced family tragedy. His mother, Shawn, Boobis's widow, died by suicide when she jumped out of a building about 15 years after Bradford's death, Barry said. Shawn had been subsisting on profits from her husband's remaining paintings that had not been sent overseas.
"She vowed that if her money ever runs out, she's not going to live on the street. And her money ran out pretty quickly," Barry said.
Eventually, Mr. Chanin fell out with Barry, resumed his undergraduate studies at Hunter College and, in 1981, married a singer. For the first time in his life, outside of college, he was not living under the same roof as a Boobis.
Mr. Chanin divorced and remarried. He later had two children with his second wife, finished law school and went on to become an insurance and appellate lawyer in New York. But, he said, he could never shake the feeling that something essential had gone missing along with those paintings.
He had never believed in his uncle's cult, he said. Yet when he put his own daughters to bed at night, he regaled them with stories of the old days -- of his uncle Brad and the rest of his special family.
'Dear Lord Rayne ...'
Mr. Chanin had long known the paintings had been whisked away to London, but it wasn't until the final years of his father's life -- Larry died in 2015 -- that he learned the whole truth about how the paintings got there. Mr. Chanin's mother had refused to discuss the night of the paintings were taken, but after she had died, Larry told his son everything, including that Larry himself was involved. The reveal brought father and son closer together than ever.
"He was a difficult character, arrogant, superior, kind of cantankerous, judgmental," Mr. Chanin said. "He never once complimented me, until the end. Then he became my biggest fan and supporter."
Armed with new resolve, Mr. Chanin decided to channel his lawyerly research skills into solving the great family mystery.
He wanted to find those paintings.
Mr. Chanin had learned that the three people who removed the paintings had shipped them to a supporter of Boobis's living in Britain, who apparently had ties to the royal family, but whose name had been lost to time.
When Barry and Mr. Chanin were living together in their 20s, Barry told him about the supporter. During his investigations, Mr. Chanin used an online database that tracks the genealogical history of the British peerage and unearthed a name that looked similar: the Honorable Robert Anthony Rayne.
Mr. Rayne, now in his early 70s, is the son of Max Rayne, a noble English lord; his public assets are worth nearly $ 70 million, according to Market Screener.
Mr. Chanin also found a contact email.
In 2017, he sat down in his home in Kew Gardens, N.Y., and began writing a message that he had been thinking about for nearly 50 years.
"Dear Lord Rayne," Mr. Chanin began, his heart racing.
Three days after Mr. Chanin reached out to Mr. Rayne, he got a response:
Dear Lester,
The collection is safe and has been looked after in accordance with Brad's wishes.
Brad and LIM were very important to me in the last few years of his life‎, I am happy to share those experiences with you.
I am curious about your sudden ‎interest after 50 years.

The paintings emerge
The first thing Mr. Chanin did after learning of Mr. Rayne's identity was provide his contact information to Barry. In Mr. Chanin's mind, Barry, as the lone surviving member of Boobis's immediate family -- and now full-time painter -- maintained legal rights to the paintings, though Mr. Rayne claims he is the rightful owner. Even though Barry said in a recent interview that he considers himself to be the owner of the paintings, he has no interest in claiming them because he believes his own works are the continuation of his father's legacy.
Mr. Rayne recalled in a recent interview that he was in New York in 1972 when he received the call from Boobis's mistress that Boobis had died. The paintings were then shipped to Mr. Rayne's home overseas. He said he exhibited the works in London in the 1970s, and for many years he allowed for about half of them to be displayed in private homes and others in offices. He said he never knew they would become emblems of loss for Boobis's family, most whom he had never met.
In December 2017, Mr. Chanin arranged an in-person meeting between Mr. Rayne and the Boobis family at a dimly lit midtown restaurant in New York.
Mr. Rayne told the group about his friendship with Boobis. He said he was taking good care of the paintings. He claimed he did not know the family was interested in the works and insisted he could not display them until he created high-resolution photographs of them, an expensive and time-consuming process.
As to his legal claim to the works, Mr. Rayne said in an interview he received documents stipulating the paintings should be sent to him and that he was not to resell them, though he declined to provide copies of those documents when asked.
Mr. Chanin continued to trade emails with Mr. Rayne and his son, Damian, for several years, asking for the paintings. In June 2021 he sent an impassioned plea over email to two of Mr. Rayne's family members, writing in part, "We want our legacy back. You have yours. Why then cannot we have ours." It wasn't long after that Mr. Rayne finally relented. Mr. Chanin reconnected with Mr. Meisel, who then reached out to Mr. Rayne directly and offered to host a showing. Mr. Meisel, Mr. Rayne said, was one of the few figures in the art world "prepared to help promote" the paintings' visibility. Mr. Rayne agreed to send the paintings to New York so that they could be exhibited on one condition: They were to be shipped back to London immediately afterward.
Mr. Chanin agreed. The show was set for June 2022 at the Meisel Gallery -- a 20,000-square-foot building owned by the same man who had displayed Boobis's works before his death. Mr. Meisel said two of Boobis's paintings, "Reflections at a Cocktail Party" and "Portrait of a Female," were "as great as anything I'd ever seen in realism and surrealism or anything representational." Those paintings, as well as "Life and Death of a Little Sun," present characters amid "swirling dreamlike scenes" and "hark back to sci-fi paperbacks of that era," according to the Meisel catalog for the gallery.
Zoe, Mr. Chanin's daughter, said she was happy for her father. But she maintains ambivalence toward Boobis and her family's proclivity for what she calls "displaced idol worship." She supported her father's quest but questioned his reasons. Her father, she said, has never been able to "find his sense of identity outside of that initial family system he was in back then."
"I don't think anyone should have a connection to greatness that comes from another human being," Barry said. "It should come from within yourself. I think it reflects a lack of self-esteem on Lester's part, the way he was raised in the cult of personality. There was too much worship of Bradford Boobis."
Zoe noted in a recent interview that her father came of age in the 1960s -- a time, she said, of stark countercultural sentiment. A subset of Americans, looking for spiritual guidance, were popping LSD and doing yoga. Some, including Mr. Chanin's parents, became involved in the Church of Scientology, said Mr. Chanin, who once took a one-week introduction course. Others, like Bradford Boobis, started cults. Zoe, 31, sees her father as a man who has never been able to pull himself out of that time or find self-worth outside of his association with his uncle.
"It's become kind of a core belief for him -- that he's valuable because he's part of this special Boobis tribe," Zoe said. Her theory is that her father, whose own art career did not pan out, feels the family's "special" gene skipped over him.
Soon after the show opened, Mr. Chanin stepped inside Mr. Meisel's gallery, where, 50 years later, Boobis's paintings were once again on display on American soil.
It felt "surreal," he said, to walk through the gallery with his uncle's paintings affixed to the white walls, surrounded by friends and family, a triumphant new swagger in his step. Zoe believes that in getting the paintings displayed for the public, her father finally felt special again. He felt like a Boobis.
Mr. Chanin continues to tell anyone who will listen about his uncle, the man with the chaotic charisma and the genius stroke with a paint brush. But even after the Meisel showing, Boobis remains a footnote in the modern art world. A Boobis painting not part of Mr. Rayne's collection, "Who is Andrea?," which initially sold for $ 25,000 in 1974, was recently purchased in an auction for $ 1,000 and sent to the buyer in New York: Lester Chanin.

Full text: Like its namesake, this film is clever, crafty and shockingly entertaining.
When the Communist Party bans your video game from state computers because it's lowering workers' productivity, you know you have a hit on your hands. But in 1988, few people outside the Iron Curtain were even aware of the existence of Tetris, never mind its potential to enchant millions. While its Russian creator, Alexey Pajitnov (Nikita Efremov), was giving away copies for free, a savvy programmer named Henk Rogers (Taron Egerton) was witnessing a demonstration of the game at a Las Vegas trade show and having his mind blown.
Like its namesake, Jon S. Baird's "Tetris" is clever, crafty and shockingly entertaining. Both origin story and underdog dramedy, the movie presents a fictionalized account of Henk's epic quest to obtain licensing rights to multiplatform versions of the game. Assembling a story that's equal parts astonishing and bamboozling, Baird and his screenwriter, Noah Pink, pit communism against capitalism and individual passion against corporate greed. Hacking gleefully into the deal-making weeds, the filmmakers refuse to shy away from wordy conference-room negotiations and head-spinning double-crosses as Henk bets his home, and at one point his freedom, on a long shot.
While the Tetris player competes only with herself, Henk -- played by Egerton with bushy-tailed zeal -- must battle multiple, more powerful adversaries. There's the weaselly Robert Stein (Toby Jones) of Andromeda Software; the infamous publishing magnate Robert Maxwell (the great Roger Allam), friend of Mikhail Gorbachev (and father of Ghislaine Maxwell), who would go on to pillage his companies' pension funds; and, not least, the Soviet authorities who own the game, including a cartoonish K.G.B. goon seeking to line his own pockets.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
There are enough characters here for an entire television series, and Pink sweats blood to cram them all in. At times, the film's sheer complexity can muddy its identity and stymie its merry momentum. To counter the denseness, Baird works vintage color graphics into pixelated animations that illustrate the movie's chapters, and some location shooting in Aberdeen, Scotland (Baird's hometown), doubles ably for Moscow. As Henk racks up frequent-flier miles on three continents (he has an ultrapatient wife and a brood of adorable children in Tokyo), Baird remains staunchly by his superhero's side. He even gives him an 11th-hour car chase.
Though too goofy to work as a Cold War thriller -- the unveiling of Nintendo's revolutionary Game Boy console presents like the discovery of penicillin -- "Tetris" is alert to the restrictions and dangers of a Soviet Union on the brink of implosion. In one of its most enjoyable sequences, Alexey takes Henk to an underground nightclub, where a reveler excitedly screams that the Estonians have declared independence. The blocks have begun to fall.
Fast and fizzy and relentlessly buoyant, "Tetris" finds its heart in the connection between these two men, the game's modest creator and its tenacious evangelist. (Hang out for a few minutes during the end credits to see their real-life counterparts interact.) When we watch them play together, we see Henk, for the first time, relax; maybe he's realizing that in business, the only person you can trust is the one who has nothing to gain.

Technology Is a Player in Video Game Remakes: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: New versions of Resident Evil 4 and Dead Space illustrate the challenges that video game developers face when immersing players in horrifying yet familiar worlds.
Die-hard fans wanted the floating spaceship of their nightmares, one stocked with mutilated zombies, improvised blowtorches and zero-gravity spectacles. The fictional engineer Isaac Clarke navigated this ramshackle vessel in Dead Space, the popular survival horror video game from 2008 that spawned two sequels.
But when developers at Motive Studios, a division of Electronic Arts based in Montreal, revisited the original for a planned remake nearly 15 years later, something was amiss.
What players remembered as terrifying seemed almost campy by modern standards because of technological advancements to graphics and artificial intelligence that have made gaming more immersive. The developers realized they would need to start from scratch, dismantling the spaceship, redesigning the zombies -- known as necromorphs -- and constructing new story lines.
"We don't necessarily want to recreate the game as it was, but like you remember it," said the remake's creative director, Roman Campos-Oriola, who previously worked on the Ghost Recon franchise. "That often means breaking stuff, which has a ripple effect."
Just as horror movies have been lucrative for theaters, nostalgia for the genre has benefited video game companies. A remake of the influential Resident Evil 4, considered by some to be one of the best video games ever, arrives on Friday, and a remake of System Shock, from 1994, is expected to hit computers in May. The Dead Space remake was the second-best-selling game in the United States in January, according to the NPD Group.
Horror remakes need to shock players in unexpected ways so they can't predict what is around the corner based on previous playthroughs, said Yasuhiro Ampo, the director of the new Resident Evil 4, which reimagines Capcom's 2005 release.
"One really big focus in development was to have respect for what people loved," he said through an interpreter.
"It's not only about making something prettier with modern standards for game graphics," he added about a game originally released for consoles like the Nintendo GameCube and Sony's PlayStation 2, "but to create that same feeling from when people played these games for the first time."
The tension in the Resident Evil franchise, about a seemingly unstoppable virus that has turned people into monstrous zombies, is amplified by its game mechanics. Enemies crash into the player's path at unexpected times, and the restrictive inventory system limits the amount of ammunition and healing herbs that can be carried.
Changes in the upcoming version include the removal of quick-time events -- which required players to mash specific buttons during cinematic cutscenes -- an innovation in the original that has grown stale through the years. More controversially, players will have the option to automatically sort their inventory instead of solving a Tetris-like puzzle inside an attaché case -- a minigame many found soothing.
The remake now allows Leon, the grizzled protagonist, to place unwanted weapons in storage and customize his case with colors and charms that add minor perks, like increased levels of healing. A durability system returns from previous remakes in the series, meaning Leon's trusty knife can break in the middle of blocking an enemy's attack, leaving the player defenseless.
Even the tiniest changes, however, are subject to criticism. After Resident Evil fans criticized a new rainfall animation seen in a preview video, Capcom said it was working on a patch to adjust the visual effect.
Sometimes, veterans from an original series are brought back to help navigate the challenges of a remake. Mike Yazijian was a young artist when he worked on the 2011 sequel to the original Dead Space; he returned as the remake's art director in his 40s.
One of the first changes Yazijian made was to the environment of the USG Ishimura, the marooned "gothic industrial" spaceship that holds horrible revelations.
"We upped the contrast," he said, explaining that the lights were there not only to illuminate the path but also to "make you feel like you're in a dentist's chair."
"The lights shine in the player's eye to make them feel uncomfortable," he said.
Yazijian went to extremes to remind players that his monsters were once people, trimming the zombies' fingernails to a square-cut shape to better resemble those of human cadavers. He also decided to shave their heads, removing the unsettling spindles of hair. "Hair is very expensive to animate in games these days," Yazijian said, explaining that getting the physics to behave properly is time intensive.
One of the game's most noticeable changes is only possible because of more powerful software: Players can fully immerse themselves in the haunting Ishimura, walking from one end to another without being buffeted by loading screens. The original required players to traverse between sections via a tram system.
For the game writer Jo Berry, the challenge of creating new story lines for Dead Space -- Isaac is notably no longer a silent protagonist -- was about elaborating on the original to enhance the game's immersive horror. She drew inspiration from the space thriller "Gravity" and the serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen's version, in the TV series "Hannibal").
"Narrative and gameplay should work together," Berry explained. "You don't want a rom-com when playing your dismemberment game."
Several developers behind horror games described their task like choreography, requiring precise timing and deft choices to deliver the terrifying experiences that players crave. The Dead Space remake uses an artificial intelligence program that employees named the Intensity Director, which can inject stress by generating enemies or creating ominous sounds when players' actions suggest they are feeling comfortable.
"We scaled it from 1 to 10," said Campos-Oriola, the game's creative director. "At 1, maybe a light will blink. At 3, maybe there's a creepy whisper in your ear. Based on what happened next, we might cool down -- or lure you into thinking it will be OK."
Artificial intelligence has been an important part of video game design since the 1980s. Among other games, sports titles like John Madden Football trained the computer to mimic the strategies of professional coaches.
More powerful technology has allowed artificial intelligence to become increasingly erratic and human. Enemies in Resident Evil 4 are zombified humans with their mental faculties still intact, and the developers wanted to make sure the evil villagers, called Ganados, were capable of planning their attacks in the remake instead of walking in a direct line toward players. The technology was also applied to Leon's companion, Ashley, who was a source of frustration: Enemies would easily topple her and she did little to resist unless the player intervened.
"In the original game, her character had a more systemlike approach where you had to check her health bar," Ampo, the director, said. "That was one more thing you had to check on all the time."
Now Ashley's programming allows her to avoid some attacks and hide behind objects. However, she will not be attacking the zombies herself. As the president's daughter, Ampo explained, she is not trained in combat.
When all these elements came together, the developers behind Resident Evil 4 felt like they had made a true remake of a classic game instead of a glossy imitation.
"We had created a tempo," the game's producer, Jun Takeuchi, said about the pacing of jump scares and zombie ambushes, "and had the epiphany that this was the game we wanted to make."

Full text: Clutter is having a moment. Is it a rejection of Instagrammability, or just another way to build cachet online?
Last week, the influencer Alix Earle took a break from her regularly programmed makeup routines to share a tour of her home on TikTok.
There's a shot of "casa cucaracha," a birdhouse placed on the kitchen floor to house cockroaches. Then a sticky-looking dining room table laden with open beverages. Then a pair of jeans crumpled up next to a case of Corona Light.
"When did living like this become a flex?" one of the video's nine million viewers asked in the comments.
Clutter has long been shoved under beds and banished to storage units; it is the villain of an entire genre of television. But messiness is a part of most people's lives, and instead of angling their cameras away, some are now documenting, or even flexing, their imperfect homes online in all of their gory detail.
Could clutter be becoming ... cool?
"There's something sort of 'it-girl'-y about the messy room," said Amalia Soto, the digital artist known as Molly Soda.
Ms. Soto, 34, said she had been seeing more videos of spaces strewn with clothing, toiletries, cosmetics and beverages posted to TikTok -- what she called the embrace of "girl clutter" in a recent essay on Substack. Partly in defiance of gender expectations that tell women to create and maintain orderly domestic spaces, young women online appeared to be "really leaning into or maybe even romanticizing chaos," she wrote.
Others have noticed, too. When the decluttering maven Marie Kondo admitted recently that her home had gotten less tidy after she had her third child, many people leaped to her defense -- and breathed a sigh of relief. Ditto when Julia Fox shared her scattered shoe boxes, moisturizers and stuffed Elmos in an impromptu apartment tour on TikTok. This was not the stuff of Architectural Digest or even social media, which is typically flooded with so-called aspirational content: spotless homes, "that girl" morning routines and a "clean girl aesthetic" defined by green juices and neat to-do lists.
That content had felt particularly alienating to Kate Woodson at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, when she was adjusting to virtual college classes from her messy bedroom in Chicago.
"I almost felt alone," said Ms. Woodson, 20-year-old student at Xavier University. "Like, I'm struggling during Covid -- am I the only one?"
When Alisha Ashour, 31, made a TikTok account in 2021, she bought a pillow, plant and white curtain-like backdrop to conceal her home. She said she was embarrassed that her brown carpeting did not match the hardwood floors she often saw on the app, especially when it was covered in toys left out by her two-and-a-half-year-old son.
The charade was hard to maintain. It took time and money that Ms. Ashour did not feel able to expend regularly, and it also felt like false advertising. "Putting on makeup, getting dressed, buying all these things to make my home look better isn't real life," she said.
In August, Ms. Ashour began sharing videos of her house as it actually looks. The response from viewers was immediate, she said: "Keep doing this, we love it, we never see this side of TikTok."
On platforms where users strive to appear relatable, messiness has become its own kind of aspirational look to be studied and replicated. On Pinterest, searches for "messy girl aesthetic" increased more than 500 percent from a year ago, according to Swasti Sarna, the company's global director of data insights.
Messes may be an especially good fit for TikTok, a platform that users turn to for content that appears authentic and unfiltered, according to a 2021 Nielsen study. Patches of carpet fight for daylight between mountains of clutter in videos tagged #messyroom, which have more than 430 million views on the app. Another 11 million views have been devoted to shots of the junk drawer in the kitchen and the "Paw Patrol" stickers on the floor under the #nonaesthetichome hashtag.
Sometimes, the mess is glamorized: One TikTok sound likens a woman's messy room to the intimate cinematic style of Sofia Coppola.
As many people cooped up at home in the early months of the pandemic entertained themselves by decluttering, Ms. Woodson shared videos of her bedroom at its messiest. Her most popular video has more than 14 million views.
She said she had never intentionally cluttered her room in order to record a video. But when she sees that her room is getting messy, she knows it might be a good time to turn the camera on. "They definitely perform a lot better than other videos," she said.
For Ms. Soto, that such videos are of intense interest to viewers means that the internet has completed a full circle since around 20 years ago, when webcams granted online viewers a new degree of visibility into many people's personal spaces.
"It's funny, we went from like, 'Oh let me just turn the camera on,' and then it was like, 'Oh, I'd better clean up in here."' All of that decluttering, she said, has resulted in a style of video so overly polished that it has grown tiresome.
"Now it's like, 'Let me trash it again,"' she said.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In January, Ms. Soto turned on her camera and trashed her sunny room in South Brooklyn in a 15-minute "room makeover" video she uploaded to YouTube. After the video's grand finale -- in which Ms. Soto scattered pads across her bed -- she shut off the camera and cleaned it all up.
As a trend, messiness has its limits, because not everyone's mess will be judged equally, Ms. Soto said: "It's chic when Julia Fox shows her real apartment, but is it chic when an everyday person does it?" The younger and more conventionally attractive the person, she said, the greater their latitude to be messy online.
Beyond social media, some people are finding other reasons to embrace mess. For one, a space without clutter can seem sterile, more like a Sweetgreen than a cozy home, said Jonah Weiner, a journalist who writes the popular fashion and design newsletter Blackbird Spyplane along with Erin Wylie. (Mr. Weiner is also a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine.)
"The model has been these zero-clutter, very formally organized places with a lot of negative space, a lot of air and, interestingly, not a lot of signs of life," Mr. Weiner said.
Francesca Edouard, a 29-year-old library assistant, sees that look in Kim Kardashian's mostly beige home, which appeared last year in a Vogue video free of almost any items on any surfaces. "When I look at it, I think, are you afraid to truly live in it?" Ms. Edouard said.
Ms. Edouard's bedroom in the Boston area is cluttered with items that are meaningful to her: Nintendo Switch games on her dresser, a floral dress she saved up for tossed on a chair, a secondhand romance novel spine-up on the bed.
Ms. Edouard enjoys spending time in a space full of stuff that's distinctly hers; after all, her bedroom is a place for her to live, not a film set. "I want it to say something about me," she said.

Full text: First Jenny Odell examined our obsession with productivity. Now she's turned to our relationship with time -- and what happens when you remove the grid.
For many people locked away during the pandemic in the summer of 2020, time felt different. Gummy and unfamiliar, it lacked the usual signposts of a commute, a day in the office, time in a classroom. A single day, or just an hour, felt like it could go on forever.
To counter the "deadening" effect of the sameness, the author Jenny Odell said, she focused on natural markers of time: migratory birds passing through her part of California, the flowering of a buckeye tree or a friend's baby growing into a toddler and learning to speak.
She poured that frame of reference into her new book, "Saving Time," which will be published Tuesday by Random House. In it, Odell looks at how time became codified and commodified, and how it might be different.
Arriving after the perspective-shifting experience of the pandemic lockdown, the book lands as many are trying to define a new normal and re-examining their relationship to time -- in particular, how much of it they want to devote to their jobs.
"I'm really interested in problems that feel personal and are experienced personally, but tie into much larger historical and structural forces," Odell said.
The project, Odell said, grew out of her first book, "How To Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy," which targeted the zeitgeist in a similar way. In it, Odell examined our obsession with productivity, and why creating monetizable things feels productive, while taking care of our own children doesn't.
The book became a best seller. But Odell said that when she heard from readers, they often told her they didn't have enough time in the day to reconsider how they approached productivity.
"I want to think about time in a shared way," Odell said. "What becomes possible collectively when you remove the grid, and stop thinking about it as little bits of time currency in each individual person's time bank, and that all you can do is hoard it."
"Saving Time" is an unusual book, a mix of history, philosophy and personal narrative. And while it takes on a topic that is central to work-life balance and conversations about well-being, it is not self-help. Odell isn't trying to tell anyone what to do. She doesn't see herself as "fixing anything," she said, but as mapping out a societal problem.
"She's a good teacher," said Joshua Batson, a good friend of hers. "She wants you to have an experience, not to listen to her."
Odell, 36, is an artist by training who taught digital art at Stanford for eight years. Her work often has an environmental focus; in one art show, she displayed refuse from the trash, sometimes pairing them with images of those same objects when they were new, along with research on where they were made. The idea was to encourage people to think about the entire life cycle of an object, she said, not just our short relationship with it. A CD player, for example, which was muddy and crushed and looked "like it had been run over by a truck," she said, was juxtaposed with an advertisement for it in pristine condition, and information on its manufacture. She has been an artist in residence at a recycling center in San Francisco and at the San Francisco Planning Department.
"My whole vibe," she said, "is artist in residence at weird places."
What unites her work is an appetite for research and an attention to detail. As a small child, she said, she once played a carnival game where the goal was to guess which foil boat had an X on the bottom. Winners received a ticket to a water theme park. Odell noticed that one of the boats was shaped a bit differently, and she thought, that must be from where they picked it up.
"I got two or three tickets and they were like, 'you can't play anymore,"' she said. "That was an early experience of: If you pay really close attention to things in a way you're not expected to, you may find something -- in that case, valuable, but at least interesting."
John Shoptaw, an English professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who was Odell's teacher in college and is now a friend, described Odell's attention as "wide-eyed."
"A lot of environmental people will have a tight focus, and they call that attention," Shoptaw said. But Odell "takes in a lot of space and a lot of time."
In "Saving Time," Odell looks at how quantified time was exported around the world by colonialists and how plantation owners used early spreadsheets to track the labor of enslaved people. She pulls from Karl Marx and eviscerates the mind-set of those she calls "productivity bros." A significant portion of the book examines climate change; Odell tries to translate her "climate dread" into something useful rather than crippling, arguing that we are at a moment when the future of the planet can still change.
But the book also focuses on the immediate physical world. Each section begins with a few paragraphs in italics that take the reader to a particular place in the San Francisco Bay Area -- a cemetery, a beach, a stretch of highway where the minutes slip away in traffic. The book is structured as a journey around the Bay Area in one imagined day, and each portion in italics is a stop along the way. The interludes, Odell said, were partly inspired by the video game "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild," where the game's challenges and battles are tied to specific locations, like a particular mountain top, rather than moving linearly.
One important moment in the book comes when Odell visits a friend who offers some lettuce from her garden. Odell tries to decline, until her friend explains that taking off the outer leaves will stimulate growth, and then there will be more lettuce for everyone.
"It's sort of beautiful, right?" Odell said. "It's a concrete example of how my friend needs to give me something so that she can have more of it."
Odell even approached the interview for this article in an unusual and physically grounded way: She assigned me homework, hoping I would better understand the version of time she was pursuing. In her book, there is a picture of a giant boulder in Upper Manhattan sandwiched between two residential buildings on Bennett Avenue, a protrusion of Manhattan schist about three stories tall rising out of the ground.
"Observe the outcrop of 450-million-year-old schist on Bennett Ave.," Odell instructed by email, "at first from across the street, then up close, including any plants that may currently be growing on it." (On the day of my visit, the rock was decorated with a snow leopard stuffed animal and a large plastic reindeer named Sven from the "Frozen" movies.)
Stuffed animals aside, this kind of grounding is central to Odell's relationship with time, the one she forged while writing this book.
"This is probably something a lot of people experienced during the pandemic," she said. "There was some assurance in seeing, ecologically speaking, big things, like migratory birds, seeing the flowers come back and seeing that this goes on. I think that was very therapeutic for people -- it obviously was for me.
"Your body also has that kind of time," she continued. "You are in that. You're not just in a calendar box."
Ultimately, she said, her goal in writing this book was to find a relationship to time that "wasn't painful," she said. And while she isn't living in bliss every moment of the day, she said, she thinks she succeeded.
"I feel better," she said. "Time feels thicker. It's made out of stuff. It's made out of people and things that are in it. It doesn't have as much of that 'empty grid of minutes' kind of feeling," she said. "When you start to think of time in more collective ways, trying to leave behind the individual time banks, it opens up the horizon of what's possible in your and others' time -- together."

This Trend Is a Mess

In late February, influencer Alix Earle took a break from her regularly programmed makeup routines to share a tour of her home on TikTok.
There’s a shot of “casa cucaracha,” a birdhouse placed on the kitchen floor to house cockroaches. Then a sticky-looking dining room table laden with open beverages. Then a pair of jeans crumpled up next to a case of Corona Light.
“When did living like this become a flex?” one of the video’s 9 million viewers asked in the comments.
Clutter has long been shoved under beds and banished to storage units; it is the villain of an entire genre of television. But messiness is a part of most people’s lives, and instead of angling their cameras away, some are now documenting, or even flexing, their imperfect homes online in all of their gory detail.
Could clutter be becoming … cool?
“There’s something sort of ‘it-girl’-y about the messy room,” said Amalia Soto, a digital artist known as Molly Soda.
Soto, 34, said she had been seeing more videos of spaces strewn with clothing, toiletries, cosmetics and beverages posted to TikTok — what she called the embrace of “girl clutter” in a recent essay on Substack. Partly in defiance of gender expectations that tell women to create and maintain orderly domestic spaces, young women online appeared to be “really leaning into or maybe even romanticizing chaos,” she wrote.
Others have noticed, too. When decluttering maven Marie Kondo admitted recently that her home had gotten less tidy after she had her third child, many people leaped to her defense — and breathed a sigh of relief. Ditto when Julia Fox shared her scattered shoe boxes, moisturizers and stuffed Elmos in an impromptu apartment tour on TikTok. This was not the stuff of Architectural Digest or even social media, which is typically flooded with so-called aspirational content: spotless homes, “that girl” morning routines and a “clean girl aesthetic” defined by green juices and neat to-do lists.
That content had felt particularly alienating to Kate Woodson at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, when she was adjusting to virtual college classes from her messy bedroom in Chicago.
“I almost felt alone,” said Woodson, a 20-year-old student at Xavier University. “Like, I’m struggling during COVID — am I the only one?”
When Alisha Ashour, 31, made a TikTok account in 2021, she bought a pillow, plant and white curtain-like backdrop to conceal her home. She said she was embarrassed that her brown carpeting did not match the hardwood floors she often saw on the app, especially when it was covered in toys left out by her 2 1/2-year-old son.
The charade was hard to maintain. It took time and money that Ashour did not feel able to expend regularly, and it also felt like false advertising. “Putting on makeup, getting dressed, buying all these things to make my home look better isn’t real life,” she said.
In August, Ashour began sharing videos of her house as it actually looks. The response from viewers was immediate, she said: “Keep doing this, we love it, we never see this side of TikTok.”
On platforms where users strive to appear relatable, messiness has become its own kind of aspirational look to be studied and replicated. On Pinterest, searches for “messy girl aesthetic” increased more than 500% from a year ago, according to Swasti Sarna, the company’s global director of data insights.
Messes may be an especially good fit for TikTok, a platform that users turn to for content that appears authentic and unfiltered, according to a 2021 Nielsen study. Patches of carpet fight for daylight between mountains of clutter in videos tagged #messyroom, which have more than 430 million views on the app. Another 11 million views have been devoted to shots of the junk drawer in the kitchen and the “Paw Patrol” stickers on the floor under the #nonaesthetichome hashtag.
Sometimes, the mess is glamorized: One TikTok sound likens a woman’s messy room to the intimate cinematic style of Sofia Coppola.
As many people cooped up at home in the early months of the pandemic entertained themselves by decluttering, Woodson shared videos of her bedroom at its messiest. Her most popular video has more than 14 million views.
She said she had never intentionally cluttered her room in order to record a video. But when she sees that her room is getting messy, she knows it might be a good time to turn the camera on. “They definitely perform a lot better than other videos,” she said.
For Soto, that such videos are of intense interest to viewers means that the internet has completed a full circle since around 20 years ago, when webcams granted online viewers a new degree of visibility into many people’s personal spaces.
“It’s funny, we went from like, ‘Oh let me just turn the camera on,’ and then it was like, ‘Oh, I’d better clean up in here.’” All of that decluttering, she said, has resulted in a style of video so overly polished that it has grown tiresome.
“Now it’s like, ‘Let me trash it again,’” she said.
In January, Soto turned on her camera and trashed her sunny room in South Brooklyn in a 15-minute “room makeover” video she uploaded to YouTube. After the video’s grand finale — in which Soto scattered pads across her bed — she shut off the camera and cleaned it all up.
As a trend, messiness has its limits, because not everyone’s mess will be judged equally, Soto said: “It’s chic when Julia Fox shows her real apartment, but is it chic when an everyday person does it?” The younger and more conventionally attractive the person, she said, the greater their latitude to be messy online.
Beyond social media, some people are finding other reasons to embrace mess. For one, a space without clutter can seem sterile, more like a Sweetgreen than a cozy home, said Jonah Weiner, a journalist who writes the popular fashion and design newsletter Blackbird Spyplane along with Erin Wylie. (Weiner is also a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine.)
“The model has been these zero-clutter, very formally organized places with a lot of negative space, a lot of air and, interestingly, not a lot of signs of life,” Weiner said.
Francesca Edouard, a 29-year-old library assistant, sees that look in Kim Kardashian’s mostly beige home, which appeared last year in a Vogue video free of almost any items on any surfaces. “When I look at it, I think, are you afraid to truly live in it?” Edouard said.
Edouard’s bedroom in the Boston area is cluttered with items that are meaningful to her: Nintendo Switch games on her dresser, a floral dress she saved up for tossed on a chair, a secondhand romance novel spine-up on the bed.
Edouard enjoys spending time in a space full of stuff that’s distinctly hers; after all, her bedroom is a place for her to live, not a film set. “I want it to say something about me,” she said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Hogwarts Legacy Sells Well Amid Rowling Controversy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The video game generated $ 850 million in sales in two weeks. Online discussion before its release was largely about the "Harry Potter" creator J.K. Rowling's comments on transgender issues.
The Hogwarts Legacy video game, set a century before the story of Harry Potter, has sold more than 12 million copies in two weeks, Warner Bros. Games said on Thursday.
The early sales figures for the role-playing game, which has generated about $ 850 million, come amid a revived debate over J.K. Rowling, the author who created the fantasy world and has drawn waves of criticism for her comments on gender identity issues.
Some critics who have called Rowling's positions anti-transgender -- a sentiment she denies -- called for a boycott of Hogwarts Legacy, which Warner Bros. Games has said she was not involved in creating. The back-and-forth over Rowling's positions grew particularly heated in the gaming community, where members tend to be deeply invested in online controversies and harassment can run rampant.
Although Hogwarts Legacy quickly broke one million concurrent viewers on the streaming site Twitch, some streamers refused to play it, and a few websites devoted to gaming coverage decided not to review it. Others sought to find a middle ground in which they engaged with the game while including caveats about Rowling or pledging to donate to L.G.B.T.Q. organizations. On forums dedicated to Hogwarts Legacy, the topic was front and center, with moderators seeking to tamp down talk about Rowling in favor of the game itself.
Elden Ring, one of last year's most popular role-playing games, sold 12 million copies in roughly two weeks. It sold more than 20 million copies in its first year on the market, its developers announced on Wednesday.
Warner Bros. Games, which has published games in the Batman: Arkham and Mortal Kombat franchises, said it was the company's biggest video game launch.
Joost van Dreunen, a gaming investor, adviser and New York University professor who studies the business of video games, called the sales numbers a "massive success," putting the game in the same league as blockbuster franchises like Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto.
"It is evidence of the appeal of strong intellectual property to mainstream gaming audiences," he said in an email, adding that the longevity of the game was in question because it is a single-player format, most likely leading some players to "burn through the content and move on."
It is not possible to determine whether online opposition to the highly anticipated game has affected its sales. The game has been released for computers, the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X and Series S and will come to the PlayStation 4, the Xbox One and the Nintendo Switch later this year.
The release of Hogwarts Legacy revived discussion of Rowling's views on transgender people, which have been scrutinized since 2018, when she liked a tweet that referred to transgender women as "men in dresses." In 2020, Rowling self-published an essay in which she said a movement of transgender activists was "seeking to erode 'woman' as a political and biological class and offering cover to predators."
Rowling has continued to be vocal on the subject, rallying against Scottish legislation that was intended to make it easier for people to legally change their gender.
Warner Bros. Games and the developer of Hogwarts Legacy, Avalanche Software, have avoided substantially addressing Rowling's comments. After fans concluded that one of the side characters in the video game is transgender, a representative for the developer told the entertainment website IGN, "It has been a high priority throughout the development of Hogwarts Legacy to create a game that is representative and diverse, aligning with our wonderful fan community."

Microsoft Pushes Merger
With Activision in E.U.
Microsoft's Xbox video game division on Tuesday announced new partnerships with Nintendo and the chip maker Nvidia as it tries to persuade European regulators to approve its planned $ 68.7 billion takeover of the game publishing giant Activision Blizzard.
A key audience for the announcements were the European Union antitrust regulators who held a closed-door meeting Tuesday with executives from Microsoft and some of its competitors, including Sony and Google.
Microsoft does not have an agreement with Xbox's chief rival, the PlayStation-maker Sony, which has sought to persuade antitrust regulators around the world to stop the merger.
The all-cash deal, which would be the largest in the history of the tech industry, faces pushback from regulators in the U.S. and Europe because it would give Microsoft control of popular game franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush. The European Commission is scheduled to decide by March 23. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Mormon Church Is Fined
For Portfolio Actions
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its investment arm have been fined $ 5 million for using shell companies to obscure the size of the portfolio under church control, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced Tuesday.
The faith, widely known as the Mormon Church, maintains billions of dollars of investments in stocks, bonds, real estate and agriculture. Much of its portfolio is controlled by Ensign Peak Advisers, a nonprofit investment manager overseen by ecclesiastical leaders known as its presiding bishopric.
The church has agreed to pay $ 1 million and Ensign Peak will pay $ 4 million in penalties.
Ensign Peak avoided disclosing investments "with the church's knowledge," Gurbir Grewal, the agency's enforcement director, said in a statement.
Federal investigators said for a period of 22 years, the firm filed asset disclosure forms through 13 shell companies they created. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Tesla Changes Course
On Battery Production
Tesla has paused plans to produce entire batteries in Brandenburg, Germany, and will instead carry out some production steps in the United States, where tax incentives are more favorable, the Brandenburg Economy Ministry said on Tuesday.
Tesla originally planned to produce the full battery at the Germany site, with a peak capacity of over 50 gigawatt-hours per year. But with the United States offering tax breaks and consumer discounts to electric carmakers that produce batteries there, the company has changed course.
"Tesla has started its battery system production in Gruenheide and is preparing to manufacture battery cell components," the ministry said in a statement. "The company has prioritized further production steps in the U.S.A. because tax incentives make business conditions more favorable there."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As a student of Martha Graham and a founding member of the Batsheva Dance Company, she helped lay the foundation for an art that has thrived in Israel.
Rena Gluck, a dancer, choreographer and educator who helped bring modern dance to Israel, and who was instrumental in creating the Batsheva Dance Company, the country's pre-eminent dance troupe, died on Jan. 13 at her home in Tel Aviv. She was 89.
Her daughters, Dalit and Daphna Murvitz, said the cause was complications of pneumonia. They added that Ms. Gluck's twin brother, Milton Gluck, died on the same day, at a hospital in Manhattan, of the same cause. The siblings had planned to celebrate their 90th birthday together in Israel the next day.
Israel is now considered a global hotbed of contemporary dance, with Batsheva still at its center. But when Ms. Gluck arrived in 1954 as a recent Juilliard graduate and a newlywed, Israel, as a young country, was still seeking and constructing its identity.
"There was such a hunger for culture," she recalled in a 2020 interview in Tel Aviv. "The appetite for dance and the love of dance was so powerful."
Israel already had a strong relationship with dance. It widely embraced folk dance, particularly on the kibbutzim, and nurtured a performance dance scene in Tel Aviv, where European refugees like Gertrud Kraus taught the improvisational, free-spirited German Expressionist style.
Ms. Gluck introduced a more rigorous technique, honed through years of training with American modern-dance pioneers, including Martha Graham, who had been her teacher at Juilliard.
After Ms. Graham's company performed in Israel in 1956, thrilling audiences with its virtuosic theatricality and sophisticated aesthetics, Ms. Gluck became an in-demand teacher of the exacting Graham style.
"Whoever wanted to do Graham went through her studio," Yair Vardi, a prominent arts administrator who danced with Ms. Gluck in Batsheva, said in an interview.
On a subsequent visit, in 1958, Ms. Graham visited a class that Ms. Gluck taught. "I like the changes you made in my technique," she told Ms. Gluck, according to Ms. Gluck's 2013 memoir, "Batsheva Dance Company 1964-1980: My Story." "You make allowances for the energy of the Israelis and this environment -- that is right."
By this time Ms. Gluck had befriended Baroness Bethsabée de Rothschild, an heiress to the Rothschild banking fortune and a longtime Graham benefactor. For years, Ms. Rothschild supported Israeli dance artists -- she bought Ms. Gluck a coveted wooden floor for her Tel Aviv dance studio -- and she eventually decided to establish Batsheva, with Ms. Graham as artistic adviser. Ms. Rothschild later cited Ms. Gluck as an inspiration for starting the company.
Batsheva made its debut in 1964 and changed the landscape of dance in Israel. It was also the first company outside Ms. Graham's own to perform her work.
Ze'eva Cohen, an acclaimed dancer and choreographer who was Ms. Gluck's student, wrote in an email that she believed Ms. Graham had agreed to this arrangement in part because "she knew and trusted Rena." Ms. Cohen also pointed out that many of Batsheva's founding dancers were able to "tackle the Graham repertory" only because of their training with Ms. Gluck.
Ms. Graham's involvement catapulted Batsheva to international attention, and as one of its stars, Ms. Gluck performed leading roles in seminal Graham dances like "Herodiade" and "Diversion of Angels," as well as in work by guest choreographers like Jerome Robbins, Donald McKayle and Glen Tetley. She choreographed several dances for the company as well.
Rena Joan Gluck and her brother, Milton, were born on Jan. 14, 1933, in New York, to Leibish and Zelda (Karabok) Gluck. Her parents had immigrated from Eastern Europe in the 1920s and met in New York. Her father, a jeweler, was unemployed when the twins arrived during the Depression. He volunteered in a grocery store, later worked there, and eventually owned a grocery store himself.
Rena had lingering medical issues from birth, and her parents were advised that dancing could help her build strength. She started classes at age 3, and within a few years dance became her passion and then her calling.
"I surprised no one when, at the age of 9, I announced to my parents and teacher that I intended to become a professional dancer," she wrote in her memoir.
While her family, including an older brother, Gene, worked in the grocery store, Ms. Gluck was encouraged to pursue dance. At 13, she began studying with renowned artists like Sophie Maslow and Jane Dudley, Graham acolytes and members of the influential New Dance Group.
In 1947, she was accepted into the new dance division at the High School of Performing Arts. After a year at Hunter College, she joined the inaugural class of the dance division at Juilliard.
There she met two people who would shape her life: Martha Graham and Moshe Murvitz, an Israeli violinist and fellow student. They married within a year and, against her parents' wishes, moved to Israel shortly after graduation. Aware of the lack of theatrical equipment available there at the time, the couple brought their own stage lights.
"My first challenge was finding dancers and a place to train and rehearse," Ms. Gluck wrote. When finding performance opportunities proved to be a struggle, she created them, traveling around the country and dancing on tables lashed together in kibbutzim dining halls.
Joining Batsheva brought a small degree of stability, but she continued juggling performance, teaching and family. Her daughter Dalit was born in 1960, her daughter Daphna in 1961.
She recalled hosting a reception after a performance of Ms. Graham's "Cave of the Heart" when a guest said to her: "You just danced Medea. Now you're taking care of your children and preparing dinner. How do you manage it?"
"I couldn't do one without the other," Ms. Gluck replied. "It's just two sides of the coin. That's who I am."
Ms. Gluck danced with Batsheva for 16 years during an often tumultuous time of artistic and administrative turnover. She served briefly as assistant director and rehearsal director and was a founder of Batsheva's junior ensemble in 1976.
She was steadfast in her commitment to the company. She was also integral to securing government funding that allowed it to endure.
"She was very strong," Mr. Vardi said. "A figure to reckon with."
In 1980, Ms. Gluck left the company and started a second career in dance education.
From 1982 to 1997, she served in various roles at the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance, including as dean of the dance faculty, head of the dance school, chairwoman of the dance department and professor. In 2007, she received a lifetime achievement award from the Israeli Ministry of Culture and Sport for her contributions to dance. Two years later, she began an oral history project for the Dance Library of Israel, for which she interviewed 120 artists.
Batsheva evolved under the direction of Ohad Naharin. It remains an internationally revered company, but it no longer resembles the one shaped by Graham.
"The dancers are extraordinary," Ms. Gluck said in 2020. "But they have nothing to do with what we were. Except they have the passion that we had. The dancers in Batsheva have always had this passion."
Ms. Gluck's marriage to Mr. Murvitz ended in divorce in 1982. In addition to her daughters -- Dalit is a doctor and Daphna a lawyer -- she is survived by five grandchildren.
Hours before their deaths, Ms. Gluck spoke by phone with her brother, a retired junior high school math teacher. Despite living across the world from each other for more than 60 years, the twins had remained close.
"They thanked each other," said Daphna Murvitz, who was present for the conversation. "They had 90 years of a very special relationship."

Jackie Rogers, 90, Designer Known for Colorful Fashions: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An outspoken American who became a model for Coco Chanel, she partied with Europe's elite before starting her own clothing line for stars and socialites.
Jackie Rogers, a fiery American model and aspiring actress whose experience mingling with the elite of Europe and the United States during the jet-setting 1960s, along with her eye for elegance and her boundless (if at times abrasive) personality, fueled a five-decade career as a go-to couturier for film stars and socialites, died on Jan. 29 in Manhattan. She was 90.
Michael Murnighan, the spokesman for her New York-based company, said the cause of her death, in a hospital, was congestive heart failure.
Since the 1970s, Ms. Rogers had targeted the celebrity set with her line of elegant clothing, which she sold out of the boutiques she ran over the years in New York, Palm Beach and the Hamptons.
Ms. Rogers started her career as a designer in the mid-1960s, crafting mod-influenced sports jackets and slacks for men -- her clients eventually included the likes of Jack Nicholson and Dustin Hoffman -- out of her boutique on Madison Avenue.
In the mid-1970s, she turned her sights to women's design. A fixture in Women's Wear Daily, she was known for her elegantly sculpted tops, dresses and gowns, in flowing silk, satin or organza, often in electric pinks, blues, yellows and other bold confectionary colors. Her creations, often made to order, were not cheap -- her gowns sold for more than $ 5,000 -- but they lured clients like Diana Ross, Salma Hayek, Patti LuPone, Barbara Walters and Nicole Kidman.
A life in fashion, however, was never the goal that Ms. Rogers, a chestnut-haired charmer with a big personality and big ambitions, envisioned while growing up in Brookline, Mass. She wanted to be an actress or a singer, and she use her work as a model beginning in her late teens as a starting point. Her looks, drive and knack for beguiling film stars, moguls and aristocrats served her well when she moved to Rome in her late 20s, and later to Paris.
Ms. Rogers quickly wove herself into the social fabric of haute European society as if she had been born into it. She loved to tell stories of sipping aperitifs with Federico Fellini, who gave her a small, uncredited role in his 1963 masterpiece, "8 ½," or tooling around in a Maserati with Gianni Agnelli, the dashing Fiat chief and playboy.
A seasoned raconteur, Ms. Rogers did not drop names so much as carpet-bomb listeners with them. Speaking to The New York Times for a 1998 profile, she recounted antiquing with Andy Warhol, dining on caviar in Monte Carlo with Aristotle Onassis and dancing the night away with Peter O'Toole at the sizzling Manhattan discothèque Ondine in the 1960s. "We were crazy," she was quoted as saying. "I was Zelda Fitzgerald and Peter was Scott -- that was my fantasy anyway."
None of her famous intimates, however, approached the influence of the French fashion titan Coco Chanel, who hired her in the early 1960s as her top model. She referred to Ms. Rogers as her "American cowboy" because of her broad shoulders, which made her an ideal mannequin for draping.
Ms. Rogers, in other words, learned design by observing one of the masters. "I was so fascinated by the way Chanel worked that I couldn't stop watching her," Ms. Rogers wrote in "My Love Affair With Chanel," a memoir she never finished that the website New York Social Diary excerpted in 2020. "As I watched her work, Chanel would sometimes say to me, 'Your eyes are going to fall out."' She added, "Since she draped her creations on models rather than sketching them, and I was the model, we became inseparable."
Like her mentor, Ms. Rogers was not afraid to be sharp-tongued in her business dealings. "Jackie had a very loud demeanor," Mr. Murnighan said in a phone interview. "She could be very charming, but she could also be very curt. And it didn't matter who you were. She could be intimidating."
A few years ago, Ms. Rogers delivered a custom wedding dress to a New York businesswoman who ran a multimillion-dollar company, but it was the wrong color -- a soft peach instead of coral. The client said nothing. "Rather than telling Jackie she made it wrong," Mr. Murnighan said, "the client redid the colors for her entire wedding, table settings and everything."
Jacqueline Rogers was born on Feb. 24, 1932, and raised in Brookline, Mass., the younger of two daughters of Maurice Rogers, a professional gambler who had run liquor from Canada during Prohibition, and Elizabeth Rogers, a hat designer.
Even as a small child, she sought to turn heads. "My first significant memory is of looking at the mirror in my mother's bedroom," she wrote in her memoir. "I was dressed up in her satin underwear, high heels flopping all around and thinking, 'One day I am getting out of here and move to N.Y.C. I am going to have a big apartment on Park Avenue, become a famous actress and entertain the rich and famous."'
She often skipped school to catch a double feature at a Boston movie house, hoping to glimpse the glamorous life she dreamed of. She got a better look at that life at 16, when she spent the summer modeling in New York. An "early, ill-fated marriage to one of the richest boys in Boston" followed, she wrote; she quickly annulled it.
Returning to New York shortly after that, she moved into the Mayflower Hotel on Central Park West with her sister, Pat, and began modeling for a coat company while studying acting at the Stella Adler Studio at night. She eventually headed to Hollywood, where she adopted the screen name Jackie Grassi and hung around the Universal Pictures commissary looking for her break. She was offered $ 150 a week as a contract player, she wrote, "but they wanted me to date the producers, so I turned them down flat."
In 1960, she moved to Rome, where she rented an apartment on the Via Margutta, a storied street in Rome's cultural life, and over the next few years secured roles in low-budget Italian films, as well as a cameo in "8 ½."
During that period, her main love interest was Prince Andrea Hercolani, a descendant of the Borghese family. Accompanying him on a trip to Paris, Ms. Rogers met a former Chanel model who offered to broker an introduction to the famed designer, who was looking for women to model for her fall collection.
At 5 p.m. that same day, Ms. Rogers arrived at Chanel's studio at 31 Rue Cambon, where she met the designer. Chanel, who was in her 70s, was wearing a beige tweed suit with a pair of scissors dangling from her neck, a pearl necklace "the size of quail eggs" and a "cigarette dangling from her mouth -- which gave her a certain amount of sex appeal even at her age," Ms. Rogers wrote.
She hired Ms. Rogers on the spot for $ 700 a week. The two spent hours together during fittings during the day, then often retired to the Ritz for dinner, Ms. Rogers wrote.
Ms. Rogers, who leaves no immediate survivors, never forgot the lessons she learned. Like Chanel, she blithely lied about her age throughout her life, carried herself with an imperious bearing and never forgot that fashion was a business, and that sometimes business requires sharp elbows
"We don't work from genius, we're tradespeople," Ms. Rogers recalled the famed designer telling her. "We don't hang clothes in galleries to be seen; we sell them."

Microsoft's Activision Deal Tests New Global Alignment on Antitrust: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Until recently, antitrust regulators in Europe and the United States took different approaches. Now, they're on the same page -- which some experts say makes closing deals harder.
When Microsoft announced its $ 70 billion acquisition of the video game maker Activision Blizzard last year, almost everyone involved expected antitrust inquiries from officials in the European Union and Britain, and many thought regulators there would try to block the deal. What U.S. enforcers would do, however, was less clear.
By December, it had become apparent that all three regulators would scrutinize the deal -- and that they were playing off one another's plans.
The tell? The Federal Trade Commission chose to sue Microsoft in its own administrative court rather than first moving to block the deal in a federal court. Typically, the agency would seek a temporary injunction from a federal judge to stop a transaction from going through before trial; in this case, the European Union's antitrust authority had already announced it was reviewing the deal. And the F.T.C. knew Europe's inquiry meant the deal was at least many months away from closing, so it went straight to its own, more favorable court.
Welcome to the modern era of global antitrust enforcement -- an elaborate labyrinth of regulatory bodies working together.
Cooperation among antitrust regulators isn't new, and U.S. regulators have long discussed timing on cases, arguments, objections and potential remedies with their foreign counterparts. The shift now is that what are perhaps the three most important regulators worldwide -- the F.T.C., the European Commission, and Britain's Competition and Markets Authority -- are roughly on the same page. All of them want to be seen as tough on deals.
Microsoft's Activision deal is the biggest test yet of this new alignment between global antitrust enforcers, which some lawyers say is making it tougher for big corporations to close deals.
Microsoft's case
Officials in more than a dozen countries are reviewing Microsoft's Activision deal, which would vault Microsoft to the top of the $ 175 billion gaming industry. Some fear that if Microsoft owns Activision, it could make some of the world's most popular games, like "Call of Duty," exclusive to its Xbox consoles.
Microsoft has said that it is not interested in this strategy, and that it is acquiring Activision to gain a foothold in mobile gaming and virtual reality. In filings and statements, the company has pledged to keep licensing of Activision games open to its competitors including Sony and Nintendo.
In the past, so-called behavioral remedies, in which companies pledge to refrain from certain activities that could hurt competition, had been accepted by antitrust enforcers, such was the case in the 2010 merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster. But today, it's harder for companies to make these sorts of compromises.
Until recently, the European Commission was often seen as the toughest antitrust regulator, taking a more expansive view of what could harm competition. On the other end of the spectrum was the United States, where decades of precedent leaned toward a more limited view of the kinds of deals that should be blocked. And so deal makers believed that if they could appease the European Union with a behavioral remedy, their transaction was likely to survive global scrutiny.
That has changed. Britain's Competition and Markets Authority, which was established in 2014, has positioned itself as pushing for tougher powers after Brexit, presenting itself as a check on Big Tech and other corporate giants. In the United States, President Biden has appointed antitrust officials -- Lina Khan of the F.T.C. and Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department's antitrust division -- who have expansive takes on regulating competition. Khan, in particular, has championed cracking down on mergers and Big Tech, and she has said she is willing to take on tough-to-win cases to help stretch the boundaries of antitrust law.
Cracking down on consolidation, especially in Big Tech, is politically popular on both the right and left, and antitrust cases are getting more attention from the public.
One former enforcement official, who asked not to be named because his employer had not authorized him to comment, put it this way to DealBook: Regulators would rather fight to block a deal and lose than accept a compromise, because the political cost of agreement is too steep.
Alignment across The Atlantic
The F.T.C. opposed Microsoft's bid to acquire Activision in a lawsuit filed in December. Microsoft's legal team also expects the antitrust authority in Britain to oppose the transaction, while it believes the European Commission is open to potential remedies, according to four people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Some of these people said that Microsoft was hoping to convince both Britain and the European Union to accept its concessions and approve the deal, which could make it easier for the company to reach an agreement with the F.T.C. before the scheduled administrative trial starts in the summer. If all of the agencies accept the compromise, the (perhaps wishful) thinking goes, none of them will look weak on Big Tech.
That logic also works in reverse: Any of the three agencies could instead put pressure on the others to oppose the acquisition.
Still, the closer philosophical alignment of American, British and European merger enforcers has its limits, as a major blow to the F.T.C. this week made clear. A federal judge rejected the agency's bid to block a deal by Meta, Facebook's parent company, to buy a virtual reality fitness start-up. That case was built upon a little-tested legal theory that the deal would hurt future competition in an untested market -- similar to the F.T.C.'s argument that Microsoft's purchase of Activision would be a threat to the still-nascent market for cloud-based gaming.
Ms. Khan herself has suggested that even if these types of cases fail, they can still push the boundaries of antitrust enforcement. For example, in the decision on Meta's bid to buy Within, which was unsealed on Friday evening, the judge found merit in the legal theory even while deciding the facts in the particular case were unconvincing.
"The new heads are trying to understand new harms," said Eleanor Fox, a professor at N.Y.U. law school who is an expert in competition policy. "They're moving into new territory."

FRONT PAGE
An article on Dec. 8, 2022, about the proliferation of the global spyware industry attributed an erroneous distinction to the Drug Enforcement Administration's use of commercial spyware. The agency's deployment of spyware from an Israeli firm is not the first confirmed use of such spyware by the federal government; the agency used a different type of spyware in another country a decade ago. This correction was delayed because the error was only recently brought to the editors' attention.
INTERNATIONAL
An article on Sunday about the agreement by the Netherlands and Japan to join the United States in barring certain kinds of semiconductor technology from China misstated the name of the think tank where Emily Benson is a senior fellow. It is the Center for Strategic and International Studies, not the Center for Strategic and International Relations.
An article on Friday about the mystery of the "first mile" of the Appian Way in Rome misstated when Rome was named the capital of Italy. It was 1871, not 1870.
NATIONAL
An article on Sunday about the disbanding of the Memphis Police unit whose officers were charged in Tyre Nichols's death misstated the given name of one of the lawyers representing Tyre Nichols's family. He is Antonio Romanucci, not Anthony.
Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about the lack of snow in New York City this winter misstated the date that it last snowed in New York City. It was March 9, 2022, not March 22.
SPORTS
Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about the ways that the Philadelphia Eagles' general manager has helped the team's success misstated the origin of the Eagles' first-round pick in this year's draft. It was acquired from the Saints last April, not in the Gardner-Johnson trade in August.
ARTS
An article on Nov. 19 about the collaboration between filmmakers and Harvey Weinstein victims to create the film "She Said" misstated the job description of Rowena Chiu. She was an assistant to Mr. Weinstein, not to Zelda Perkins. This correction was delayed for research.
A music review on Monday of the musical "La Cage aux Folles" misstated the given name of the show's assistant choreographer. She is Mariana Souza, not Maria.
A music review on Monday of nine new works in the Kronos program at Zankel Hall misstated how many strings are on a dan bau. The instrument has one string, not 16.

Marion Meade Dies at 88; Helped to Renew Interest In Dorothy Parker's Work: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Her books also included biographies of Eleanor of Aquitaine and the suffragist leader Victoria Woodhull, as well as Buster Keaton and Woody Allen.
Marion Meade, who helped revive interest in Dorothy Parker, the celebrated writer and sardonic wit of the Algonquin Round Table, with her 1988 biography, died on Dec. 29 at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.
Her granddaughter Ashley Sprague confirmed the death. She said that Ms. Meade had recently had Covid-19, but that a cause had not been determined.
Ms. Meade's "Dorothy Parker: What Fresh Hell Is This?" detailed the vibrant if difficult life of a major figure on the literary scene of the 1920s and '30s.
Mrs. Parker joined Vanity Fair magazine as its drama critic at 24; coined well-known lines like "Men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses" and "You can lead a horticulture but you can't make her think"; and was a founding member of the round table at the Algonquin Hotel in Midtown Manhattan where she, the writer Robert Benchley, the critic Alexander Woollcott and others engaged in witty commentary.
But she drank too much, suffered from depression, had one failed marriage to Edwin Parker II and two marriages (and one divorce) to the screenwriter Alan Campbell. She tried to commit suicide twice. In 1930, when she could not finish a novel she had promised to her editor at Viking, Ms. Meade wrote, Mrs. Parker "panicked and drank a bottle of shoe polish," which sent her to the hospital.
Mrs. Parker died in 1967, having offered her own epitaph: "Excuse my dust."
Ms. Meade had already published a biography of Eleanor of Aquitaine, who in the 12th century was queen of both England and France, when she decided to turn her attention to another personality. Her focus was initially on the poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, but she soon learned that another writer was working on her biography. She shifted her attention to Mrs. Parker -- whom she called "one of the funniest women of the 20th century, whose wit and good sense never fail to entertain me," in an essay many years later for Contemporary Authors.
"From time to time readers will say to me, 'Oh, she had such a sad life,"' she added. But, she said, she disagreed: While alcoholism and depression derailed her at times, she wrote, they "did not prevent her from being wildly successful, the multitalented author of verse, stories, plays, movie scripts and criticism."
Reviews of the book were mixed. Writing in The Pittsburgh Press, Roy McHugh called it an "admirably straightforward biography" that "explains more than is possible and excuses nothing." But in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote, "Parker's cynical wit, of course, cannot have made it easy for friends or biographers to penetrate her defensive armor, but instead of attempting to really come to terms with her emotional life, Ms Meade simply settles for catchphrases, attributing her problems to insecurity or self-loathing."
Kevin Fitzpatrick, president of the Dorothy Parker Society, said that the book elevated Mrs. Parker's profile enough to persuade Penguin Classics to rerelease collections of her short stories and poems in the 1990s. And, he said, Ms. Meade believed the screenplay of "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" (1994), directed by Alan Rudolph, written by Mr. Rudolph and Randy Sue Coburn and starring Jennifer Jason Leigh in the title role, was based in part on her biography.
"She talked to a lawyer, but she did not sue," Mr. Fitzpatrick said in a phone interview. "It was a low point for her."
Marion Lolita Sidhu was born on Jan. 7, 1934, in Pittsburgh. Her father, Surain Sidhu, an Indian immigrant, was a physicist who directed the X-ray laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh and later worked on top secret research at the Argonne National Laboratory. Her mother, Mary (Homoney) Sidhu, was a homemaker.
Marion's desire to be a writer started in childhood. She studied journalism at Northwestern University, where she earned a bachelor's degree in 1955.
Arriving in Manhattan later that year to attend the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, she quickly headed to the Algonquin, sat on a settee in the lobby's cocktail lounge, lit up a cigarette, ordered a Tom Collins and soaked in the view that must have been familiar to Mrs. Parker.
After receiving her master's degree in 1956, she spent a year interviewing celebrities and checking facts for the syndicated gossip columnist Earl Wilson.
Over the next two decades, Ms. Meade freelanced for publications including McCall's, Cosmopolitan and The Village Voice; and joined the New York Radical Feminists, a group that occupied the offices of Ladies' Home Journal for 11 hours in 1970 and secured a promise, which was fulfilled, to put out a special "women's liberation" supplement in a forthcoming issue. She was also a longtime editor at Aviation Week magazine.
Her first book, "Bitching," was based on her conversations with women about the female experience and how they felt about men, was published in 1973. She followed that in 1976 with a biography of Victoria Woodhull, a leader of the women's suffrage movement.
Ms. Meade's "Eleanor of Aquitaine" (1977) was praised by the critic Robert Kirsch of The Los Angeles Times for her "almost uncanny empathy for her subject," which he said made it appear as if "she can view the world through Eleanor's eyes."
She spent seven years researching and writing the Parker book. She followed it with biographies of the silent film comedian Buster Keaton in 1995 and Woody Allen in 2000. She returned to Dorothy Parker in 2004 with "Bobbed Hair and Bathtub Gin: Writers Running Wild in the Twenties," a joint portrait of four writers: Mrs. Parker, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Zelda Fitzgerald and Edna Ferber.
In addition to Ms. Sprague, she is survived by another granddaughter, Katharine Sprague; her daughter, Alison Linkhorn; and one great-granddaughter. Her marriages to Charles Meade, Forbes Linkhorn and the writer Milton Viorst, who died last month, ended in divorce.
Ms. Meade returned a few times to her best-known subject. She edited and wrote the introduction to a new edition of "The Portable Dorothy Parker" (2006). In 2014, she expanded on a 2006 Bookforum article about Mrs. Parker in a Kindle book, "The Last Days of Dorothy Parker."
In that book, she touched on the saga of how the urn with Mrs. Parker's ashes ended up being stowed in Manhattan in a file cabinet belonging to the veteran New York City politician Paul O'Dwyer, who was the lawyer for the writer Lillian Hellman, the literary executor of the Parker estate. (The urn, after a circuitous journey, was finally buried in 2020 at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.)
In 1987, Ms. Meade called Mr. O'Dwyer to say she was going to visit the cemetery in Westchester where she thought the urn had been buried. With her biography of Mrs. Parker complete and Ms. Hellman dead, Ms. Meade wanted to pay her respects.
"Oh, she's not there," Mr. O'Dwyer told her.
"Of course she is," Ms. Meade said.
"No, no," Mr. O'Dwyer said, "I'm looking right at her."

As Historical Dramas Mushroom, So Do Complaints About Their Inaccuracies: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The entertainment genre of historical drama is flourishing -- and riddled with inaccuracies. The untrue parts are leading to more public spats and lawsuits.
The following stories are not based on real events. In fact, they're completely made up -- even though they're meant to seem real.
No, Queen Elizabeth's staff never hid a copy of The Sunday Times from her because of a devastating, but nonexistent, front-page headline: "Queen Should Abdicate in Favour of Prince of Wales -- Half of British Public Agrees."
No, the former Los Angeles Lakers head coach Jerry West didn't fly into fits of rage so violent that he tossed his Most Valuable Player trophy through a window in his office.
And no, the two police officers who unwittingly missed an opportunity to arrest Jeffrey Dahmer before he could kill again were not given honors as officers of the year by the Milwaukee Police Department.
But the millions of people who watched three of the most popular historical dramas of the last year -- "The Crown" and "Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story" on Netflix and HBO's "Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty" -- were left to separate fact from fiction on their own.
These series are hardly outliers in the flourishing genre of based-on-a-true-story entertainment.
As the number of shows and movies that depict real events has grown in recent years -- never before have dramatizations of well-known people and events been so popular and prevalent -- so, too, have the liberties that screenwriters are taking with the facts.
In many instances, these are not mere embellishments for dramatic flair but major fabrications. Some of the people who claim they've been reduced to crude caricatures onscreen are suing for defamation. And shows like "The Crown" have been forced to belatedly add disclaimers stating that what people are watching is in fact a dramatized version of real events.
Sometimes disclaimers are enough to protect a studio from legal liability, especially if they are prominently displayed in the opening credits and offer detail of what has been fictionalized -- beyond a generic acknowledgment such as "based on real events," legal experts say. The First Amendment offers broad protections for expressive works like film and television productions that depict real people by their real names.
But if someone can convincingly claim that he or she was harmed by what screenwriters made up, that is grounds for a strong defamation suit, said Jean-Paul Jassy, a lawyer who works on media and First Amendment cases in Los Angeles.
"A disclaimer is not a silver bullet," he said.
"And this is where it gets very tricky with docudramas," Mr. Jassy added. "A court could say: 'I understand there are fictionalized elements of your show. But you used a real person's name, and you presented as fact something that's false that hurt their reputation."'
Lawsuits fail more often than not because very few fans of these shows probably believe they are watching history as it literally unfolded. Hollywood has, of course, always amped up the drama when telling -- and selling -- true stories.
But when shows like "The Crown" become so popular because -- at least to some degree -- viewers believe they are getting an education, the liberties taken by writers go beyond dramatic license, say those who have a stake in getting the facts straight.
Hugo Vickers, a British journalist who has been fact-checking episodes of "The Crown" for The Sunday Times and is the author of several books about the monarchy, called some of what has transpired over the show's five seasons "a complete perversion of history."
"They do it all the time," Mr. Vickers said. "And they couldn't care less."
Netflix added a disclaimer after criticism from high places about the inaccuracies in "The Crown," including from the famed British actress Judi Dench and former Prime Minister John Major over a scene that depicted an imagined conversation between Mr. Major and Prince Charles about the queen's possible abdication. But the disclaimer, saying the series is "inspired by real events," appeared not on the show itself but rather on its press materials and in the trailer, which aired on YouTube.
A disclaimer also appears in HBO's show on the Lakers, saying in part, "This series is a dramatization of certain facts and events." But Mr. West, the former coach, and some of his players found that wholly insufficient. Through his lawyer, Mr. West demanded an apology from HBO, saying the show "falsely and cruelly" maligned him as an "an out-of-control, intoxicated rage-aholic."
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the former Lakers center and a central character in "Winning Time," accused HBO of "heavy-handed virtue signaling" for inventing scenes meant to highlight the sexist treatment many women endured in the workplace in the 1970s.
In his Substack newsletter, Mr. Abdul-Jabbar wrote that the show's attempt to draw attention to the issue was offensive because it depicted one female team executive unbuttoning her blouse and fixing her hair before meeting with her future boss -- something the executive has said never happened.
The scene, Mr. Abdul-Jabbar said, "reduces her intelligence and competence for a cheap joke."
HBO said in a statement that it "has a long history of producing compelling content drawn from actual facts and events that are fictionalized in part for dramatic purposes." The network added, "'Winning Time' and its depictions, as with other similar shows, are based on extensive factual research and reliable sourcing."
HBO is not the only studio that has invented story lines that have a poignant social and cultural resonance today.
Defamation experts and Hollywood studios are closely watching developments in a lawsuit filed against Netflix by Linda Fairstein, a former prosecutor who objected to her depiction in a 2019 series about the "Central Park Five" case, "When They See Us." The show dramatizes how law enforcement in New York City, including Ms. Fairstein, rushed to condemn five Black and Latino teenagers -- all of whom were eventually exonerated -- for the rape of a white woman who was jogging in Central Park in 1989.
In the series, Ms. Fairstein is shown withholding evidence, encouraging the police to harshly interrogate the suspects and expressing a callous disregard for the truth about whether they were actually guilty. After the show was released, and a backlash against Ms. Fairstein on social media ensued, her book publisher dropped her and she was forced to resign from her position on several boards.
Ms. Fairstein has said her portrayal is "grossly and maliciously inaccurate," and she sued in March 2020. A federal judge ruled that her claims of defamation in five separate scenes in the series were plausible, and the case is proceeding in U.S. District Court. Ava DuVernay, the show's creator, consulted with the wrongfully accused men, but not with Ms. Fairstein.
In court filings, lawyers for Netflix argued that the script was clearly protected under the First Amendment as "an artistic dramatization of controversial and contested historical events."
With the heightened sensitivity toward confronting racial and gender inequality, many Hollywood screenwriters are turning these issues into major story lines, even if that means sometimes exaggerating the details. This was the case in "Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story," one of Netflix's biggest hits of the last year.
While the series uses historical records to accurately portray much of how Dahmer, the cannibalistic serial killer, preyed on young men and got away with it for so long, including court transcripts from his 1992 trial, it invents moments to convey how systemic failures in the criminal justice system allowed him to remain at large.
The opening scene of "Monster," for instance, shows one of the characters, a Black woman, watching a report on the evening news that unsettles her: Five white Milwaukee police officers had beaten up a Black undercover officer, thinking he was a criminal.
But when The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel fact-checked the series -- and revealed more than a few inaccuracies -- it found no reports of any incident like that in Milwaukee. The only report that seemed to match, the paper said, occurred in Tennessee a year after Dahmer was arrested.
Anne E. Schwartz, a former police reporter who was on the scene the night Dahmer was arrested and later wrote a book about the case, faulted the writers for projecting themes that are far more salient today onto events that happened more than 30 years ago.
"We're going back and looking at this case from the lens of 2022, not 1990," she said.
When HBO debuted a biographical drama last year about Julia Child, the celebrity chef, some who knew her said it had inaccurately portrayed her husband, Paul, as being threatened by her success. And Ms. Child's longtime producer complained that he was wrongly shown as skeptical about her first cooking program -- a barrier-breaking success for a woman on television in the 1960s.
Lawyers who represent studios say it's often not feasible -- or legally necessary -- to fact-check scripts for historical accuracy. And it's uncommon for producers to involve the people whose lives they are fictionalizing. They're under no legal obligation to do so.
"In the industry, most real-life people are not consulted very much because it's a pain for the filmmakers," said Zelda Perkins, a former assistant to the movie producer Harvey Weinstein. Ms. Perkins worked with the producers on "She Said," the new drama that follows New York Times reporters as they uncover Mr. Weinstein's decades of sexual abuse of women.
"I think that the film industry has an enormous way to go if they're going to continue making stories about real-life people at the speed that they do," she added. "Because actually having gone through it with being treated fairly respectfully, I cannot even imagine the damage it must cause to people who weren't collaborated with."
Filmmakers often try to be as sensitive as possible to the people whose stories they're telling, said Brad Simpson, producer of the "American Crime Story" anthology, which covered three dramatic moments in recent history -- the O.J. Simpson murder trial, the assassination of Gianni Versace and President Bill Clinton's impeachment. That's why, Mr. Simpson said, he and his colleagues involved Monica Lewinsky in their series "Impeachment" to help her regain control of her version of what had happened.
"I think when you're making TV based on real people, you always have to be incredibly aware that there are real victims at the center of all these stories," he said.
But Mr. Simpson, who likened the current popular fascination with true crime to what the nation experienced in the 1960s and '70s with "In Cold Blood" and "Helter Skelter," acknowledged that at the end of the day, what he and other producers were doing was creating entertainment.
"It's really hard for people when you have been part of a true story and then you see your experience onscreen. Your natural instinct is to feel violated and to feel like: 'Well, nobody spoke to me. Or I should be paid for my story,"' Mr. Simpson said.
"That's not the way the law works," he added. "That's not the way these shows get made or written."
And the cold reality, he said, is "your story can be used to sell streaming subscriptions."

Netflix added a disclaimer after criticism from high places about the inaccuracies in “The Crown,” including from famed British actor Judi Dench and former Prime Minister John Major over a scene that depicted an imagined conversation between Major and Prince Charles about the queen’s possible abdication. But the disclaimer, saying the series is “inspired by real events,” appeared not on the show itself but rather on its press materials and in the trailer, which aired on YouTube.
A disclaimer also appears in HBO’s show on the Lakers, saying in part, “This series is a dramatization of certain facts and events.” But West, the former coach, and some of his players found that wholly insufficient. Through his lawyer, West demanded an apology from HBO, saying the show “falsely and cruelly” maligned him as an “an out-of-control, intoxicated rage-aholic.”
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the former Lakers center and a central character in “Winning Time,” accused HBO of “heavy-handed virtue signaling” for inventing scenes meant to highlight the sexist treatment many women endured in the workplace in the 1970s.
In his Substack newsletter, Abdul-Jabbar wrote that the show’s attempt to draw attention to the issue was offensive because it depicted one female team executive unbuttoning her blouse and fixing her hair before meeting with her future boss — something the executive has said never happened.
The scene, Abdul-Jabbar said, “reduces her intelligence and competence for a cheap joke.”
HBO said in a statement that it “has a long history of producing compelling content drawn from actual facts and events that are fictionalized in part for dramatic purposes.” The network added, “‘Winning Time’ and its depictions, as with other similar shows, are based on extensive factual research and reliable sourcing.”
HBO is not the only studio that has invented storylines that have a poignant social and cultural resonance today.
Defamation experts and Hollywood studios are closely watching developments in a lawsuit filed against Netflix by Linda Fairstein, a former prosecutor who objected to her depiction in a 2019 series about the “Central Park Five” case, “When They See Us.” The show dramatizes how law enforcement in New York City, including Fairstein, rushed to condemn five Black and Latino teenagers — all of whom were eventually exonerated — for the rape of a white woman who was jogging in Central Park in 1989.
In the series, Fairstein is shown withholding evidence, encouraging police to harshly interrogate the suspects and expressing a callous disregard for the truth about whether they were actually guilty. After the show was released, and a backlash against Fairstein on social media ensued, her book publisher dropped her and she was forced to resign from her position on several boards.
Fairstein has said her portrayal is “grossly and maliciously inaccurate,” and she sued in March 2020. A federal judge ruled that her claims of defamation in five separate scenes in the series were plausible, and the case is proceeding in U.S. District Court. Ava DuVernay, the show’s creator, consulted with the wrongfully accused men, but not with Fairstein.
In court filings, lawyers for Netflix argued that the script was clearly protected under the First Amendment as “an artistic dramatization of controversial and contested historical events.”
With the heightened sensitivity toward confronting racial and gender inequality, many Hollywood screenwriters are turning these issues into major storylines, even if that means sometimes exaggerating the details. This was the case in “Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” one of Netflix’s biggest hits of the last year.
While the series uses historical records to accurately portray much of how Dahmer, the cannibalistic serial killer, preyed on young men and got away with it for so long, including court transcripts from his 1992 trial, it invents moments to convey how systemic failures in the criminal justice system allowed him to remain at large.
The opening scene of “Monster,” for instance, shows one of the characters, a Black woman, watching a report on the evening news that unsettles her: Five white Milwaukee police officers had beaten up a Black undercover officer, thinking he was a criminal.
But when The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel fact checked the series — and revealed more than a few inaccuracies — it found no reports of any incident like that in Milwaukee. The only report that seemed to match, the paper said, occurred in Tennessee a year after Dahmer was arrested.
Anne E. Schwartz, a former police reporter who was on the scene the night Dahmer was arrested and later wrote a book about the case, faulted the writers for projecting themes that are far more salient today onto events that happened more than 30 years ago.
“We’re going back and looking at this case from the lens of 2022, not 1990,” she said.
When HBO debuted a biographical drama last year about Julia Child, the celebrity chef, some who knew her said it had inaccurately portrayed her husband, Paul, as being threatened by her success. And Child’s longtime producer complained that he was wrongly shown as skeptical about her first cooking program — a barrier-breaking success for a woman on television in the 1960s.
Lawyers who represent studios say it’s often not feasible — or legally necessary — to fact-check scripts for historical accuracy. And it’s uncommon for producers to involve the people whose lives they are fictionalizing. They’re under no legal obligation to do so.
“In the industry, most real-life people are not consulted very much because it’s a pain for the filmmakers,” said Zelda Perkins, a former assistant to movie producer Harvey Weinstein. Perkins worked with the producers on “She Said,” the new drama that follows New York Times reporters as they uncover Weinstein’s decades of sexual abuse of women.
“I think that the film industry has an enormous way to go if they’re going to continue making stories about real-life people at the speed that they do,” she added. “Because actually having gone through it with being treated fairly respectfully, I cannot even imagine the damage it must cause to people who weren’t collaborated with.”
Filmmakers often try to be as sensitive as possible to the people whose stories they’re telling, said Brad Simpson, producer of the “American Crime Story” anthology, which covered three dramatic moments in recent history — the O.J. Simpson murder trial, the assassination of Gianni Versace and President Bill Clinton’s impeachment. That’s why, Brad Simpson said, he and his colleagues involved Monica Lewinsky in their series “Impeachment” to help her regain control of her version of what had happened.
“I think when you’re making TV based on real people, you always have to be incredibly aware that there are real victims at the center of all these stories,” he said.
But Simpson, who likened the current popular fascination with true crime to what the nation experienced in the 1960s and ’70s with “In Cold Blood” and “Helter Skelter,” acknowledged that at the end of the day, what he and other producers were doing was creating entertainment.
“It’s really hard for people when you have been part of a true story and then you see your experience on screen. Your natural instinct is to feel violated and to feel like: ‘Well, nobody spoke to me. Or I should be paid for my story,’” Simpson said.
“That’s not the way the law works,” he added. “That’s not the way these shows get made or written.”
And the cold reality, he said, is “your story can be used to sell streaming subscriptions.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.
