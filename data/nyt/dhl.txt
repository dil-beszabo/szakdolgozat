Full text: Workers who load and unload cargo planes at DHL's hub near Cincinnati walked out after months of negotiations failed to produce a contract.
More than 1,100 workers at DHL Express's global air cargo hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport went on strike on Thursday after months of failed negotiations with the parcel carrier.
A group of DHL workers at the hub who load and unload planes voted in April to unionize with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which has been in contract negotiations with the company since July. The union has filed more than 20 unfair labor practice complaints with the National Labor Relations Board since then, accusing the company of retaliation against organized workers. Teamsters Local 100, which represents the unionized workers, voted to authorize a strike on Sunday.
"The company forced this work stoppage, but DHL has the opportunity to right this wrong by respecting our members and coming to terms on a strong contract," Bill Davis, president of Local 100, said in a statement.
DHL Express is the U.S. unit of the world's largest logistics company, Deutsche Post, but accounts for only 2.3 percent of the market in the United States in package volume, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index. As a German company, it is not able to ship between domestic airports within the United States, so it has to contract out those services and instead focuses on handling international shipments.
A DHL spokesman said the company "was fully prepared for this anticipated tactic and has enacted contingency plans" like redirecting shipments to avoid Cincinnati and adding replacement staff members.
The company noted that roughly 4,000 employees at the facility were still on the job. It said it did not "anticipate any significant disruptions to our service performance."
"Unfortunately, the Teamsters decided to try and influence these negotiations and pressure the company to agree to unreasonable contract terms by taking a job action," the company spokesman said in a statement.
The DHL strike comes at a time of increased tensions in the industry between companies and organized labor.
On Thursday, the Teamsters threated to strike at a United Parcel Service facility in Louisville, Ky., accusing the company of engaging in "similar practices to disrespect and abuse our members in the same state" by laying off administrative workers who had just voted to unionize. The union threatened to strike at UPS as well if it "doesn't get its act together" by Monday.
UPS narrowly averted a strike over the summer after contentious negotiations with the Teamsters, which threatened to halt operations for the country's largest parcel service.
The facility where DHL workers are striking is directly in front of Amazon's Air Hub, where a unionization effort is underway. Workers there have accused Amazon of illegally impeding organizing efforts.

If You Plant Milkweed, They Will Come: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: These underappreciated plants attract a "hungry throng" of beneficial insects. They're not bad to look at, either.
To see a field of common milkweed in midsummer -- a sea of a thousand nodding pink flower heads -- you would not imagine that anything could ever stand in the way of the genus Asclepias.
Yes, common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), the most widespread milkweed east of the Rocky Mountains, can colonize disturbed sites and form impressive stands. But it is an exception among the more than 90 recognized North American species of milkweed, many of which often find it not so easy to continue making themselves at home.
"The milkweed is a displaced citizen in its own land," writes Eric Lee-Mäder in the opening of his new book, "The Milkweed Lands: An Epic Story of One Plant, Its Nature and Ecology." "Where once it owned the continent, it's now a kind of vagrant, occupying the botanical equivalent of homeless encampments."
As one example, he cites 2012 research, by John M. Pleasants of Iowa State University and Karen S. Oberhauser of the University of Minnesota, that estimates a nearly 60 percent decrease in the milkweed populations of the Midwest since 1999.
"Milkweeds, at least the North American ones, are like so many other meadow and grassland species," Mr. Lee-Mäder said in a recent conversation. "They're both dependent upon us and also subject to the various indignities of coexisting with us."
The beginnings of our agrarian legacy set much of their displacement in motion, when vast tracts of original prairie sod were plowed up to create croplands. Since the 1990s, the use of increasingly sophisticated chemical herbicides that kill everything but the crops genetically engineered to resist them has essentially "targeted milkweeds for elimination," he said.
Once, milkweed "would get shredded and pulverized by cultivation equipment, but it would spring back from the live rhizomes underground," he continued. Now, "the milkweed within those systems just dies."
We have relegated milkweed to ditches and abandoned lots, said Mr. Lee-Mäder, an ecologist at the invertebrate-focused Xerces Society, where he is the co-director of pollinator and agricultural biodiversity. He directs the nonprofit's private-sector initiatives, supporting pollinator-conservation work across thousands of acres with companies like General Mills, Nestlé and Danone, undertaking habitat restoration on farms that supply them with ingredients like almonds and blueberries.
Mr. Lee-Mäder and his wife, Mari Lee-Mäder, also operate Northwest Meadowscapes, in Port Townsend, Wash., a supplier of regional native seeds that also provides consultation services for meadow makers.
They know something that anyone who gives milkweed refuge will soon learn: If you welcome this plant, a diverse, living fan base will follow close behind -- and not only monarch butterflies.
If you plant it, they will come. Sometimes as if out of thin air.
A Two-Way Chemistry Equation
If someone says "milkweed," maybe you also hear "monarch butterfly" in your head. It's almost as if the two are inextricably linked.
Mention of this plant probably also brings to mind stories of its distinctive chemistry. Many plants defend themselves against herbivory by producing unpalatable or toxic chemicals, but "milkweeds take this strategy especially seriously," Mr. Lee-Mäder writes.
Asclepias produce potent steroids called cardenolides "that can disrupt the life functions of vertebrate animals unlucky enough to feed on them," he adds. (A bonus: These chemicals may also discourage deer.)
But while milkweeds have evolved their chemical defenses to protect themselves, they may also "be gifting these chemical defenses to some of the animals that live in association with them," Mr. Lee-Mäder said, "as much as using these to check and control the amount of herbivory that they have to sustain."
One notable example: monarchs, which have famously evolved to ingest milkweeds without harm. Their larvae rely on Asclepias as an obligate host plant, or a food required for at least one stage of development. Eating it fosters an anti-predation chemical defense of their own.
So critical is this relationship that female monarchs lay their eggs on milkweed leaves, ensuring that the needed sustenance is at hand when offspring emerge.
"They use their olfactory sense to identify the locations of milkweeds on wind currents," Mr. Lee-Mäder said, "tracking those down like bloodhounds on a trail, to be able to lay their eggs on those plants."
The monarch-milkweed connection is often spoken of as "chemical warfare," but Mr. Lee-Mäder prefers to think of it as a "two-way relationship" or "a partnership."
The monarchs' part: Although the adult butterflies are not great pollinators, they do visit milkweed flowers for nectar, potentially moving some pollinia (milkweeds' pollen-bearing structures) long distances during their migrations.
"That gene flow that monarchs may facilitate is probably unmatched by other flower visitors to milkweeds," Mr. Lee-Mäder said.
Not Just Monarchs
As intimate and celebrated as the plants' relationship with monarchs is, the community surrounding milkweeds is far more diverse.
"The hungry throng" that Mr. Lee-Mäder enumerates includes at least 40 insect species that "feed often or exclusively on North American milkweeds in the summer," he writes. They include butterflies, moths, beetles and aphids.
In a milkweed seed-farm field in the Midwest, he recalls witnessing a cloud of aphids descend on the breeze, as if tuned in by GPS to the emerging crops' location. "It's like seeing nature sort of manifest itself out of thin air around this plant," he said.
Before you say, "No, not aphids; not in my garden," think about their role in the big picture, Mr. Lee-Mäder said -- as food for beneficial insects like lady beetles and lacewing insects, for instance, which are, in turn, food for birds. And one of the most abundant milkweed-visiting aphids, the nonnative oleander aphid, is host-specific, meaning it doesn't eat other plants.
Other invertebrates, including slugs, snails and spider mites, may feast on milkweeds, too, as do some larger animals, like rabbits and ground squirrels, which are apparently resistant to poisoning.
Beyond so many opportunities for herbivory, Asclepias flowers provide nectar to adult butterflies and moths, along with an astonishing lineup of bee species and wasps.
And just look at them: Milkweeds are "among the most elaborate in the plant kingdom," he writes, with "a complexity comparable to that of rare orchids."
Which Ones to Grow?
It's easy to take delight in a stand of common milkweed or its Western counterpart, showy milkweed (A. speciosa) -- whether in bloom or later, holding their substantial seed-filled pods, or follicles. Lanky as these three- or four-footers may be, they put you "face to face with the wildness of what this genus can represent," Mr. Lee-Mäder said.
He expresses awe for rush milkweed (A. subulata), a three- to five-foot plant with whitish-green blooms that grows alongside the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) in nearly rainless parts of the desert Southwest. "It's a plant made up of stems -- it produces almost no leaves," he said, explaining its adaptation for survival.
There are other choices for gardens without a meadow-size space to offer, though, or those that aren't in the most arid places.
It's no surprise that butterfly weed (A. tuberosa), with its vivid orange flowers, has received the most horticultural attention.
"It's beautiful, it's compact, it's charismatic," Mr. Lee-Mäder said, noting also that orange is fairly uncommon among prairie and meadow flowers. Although the palette of Asclepias is generally quite different from East to West, "tuberosa is one that crosses the Continental Divide," he said, residing even in parts of the desert Southwest.
At just about two and a half feet high, a mature plant can produce "strikingly abundant blooms for the space that it takes up, and attract a really remarkable spectrum of flower visitors," he added. It is also pretty well adapted to the often highly altered soils of our human landscapes.
As its common name implies, swamp milkweed (A. incarnata), with its distinctive magenta flowers on stems of up to about four feet, can handle it wet. With rain gardens and bioswales increasingly being planted to manage more insistent runoff in a changing climate, this widespread species should get more play. Do you have a spot for it just beneath a downspout, or maybe at a pond's edge?
Another important but underappreciated species that Mr. Lee-Mäder wants to put in a word for, especially with Western gardeners, is the lavender-and-white-flowered narrowleaf milkweed (A. fascicularis), "one of the most widespread breeding plants for Western monarchs," he said.
Unlike Eastern butterfly populations, which overwinter in Mexico, Western monarchs spend the winter in coastal California and then move inland around March for breeding season. Their clusters break up and typically move straight eastward, into the Central Valley or Sierra Nevada foothills, fanning out from there.
"A monarch that wintered in Monterey might end up in Las Vegas or Boise or Spokane that next spring and summer," he said. They need more narrowleaf milkweed along their routes.
Like so many native plants, milkweeds may have persisted only on the fringes in nature, but gardeners can offer them prominent spots. A good place to begin researching which ones to choose is the Xerces Society's Project Milkweed and its region-specific plant lists.
"Planting milkweeds in a garden may be a small dent -- but it's a dent," Mr. Lee-Mäder said. "If everybody does it, it will add a different kind of richness to our landscapes."

Full text: It's one of the great origin stories in contemporary art, a flash of instinct that would revolutionize a field. In 1998, El Anatsui was walking around Nsukka, Nigeria, and noticed a bag of aluminum bottle caps by the roadside.
Anatsui, then a professor at the University of Nigeria who was drawn to daily-life materials in his own art practice, took the bag to his studio. He began to play with the caps: folding them, slicing them in rounds and opening their cylindrical sides.
Working with assistants, he found a method. He punctured the metal bits in several places and linked them with copper wire. The compositional language rewarded scale: Soon individual works would enfold hundreds of thousands of these molecules. They would dance when hung on walls and cover entire buildings.
As they have awed viewers worldwide -- at the Venice Biennale in 2007 or the Brooklyn Museum in 2013, for instance -- Anatsui's bottle-cap confections have defied description and category. Is he sculpting, or weaving? Is this art modern, abstract, universal, African?
The answer to all of these is: Yes.
This week, Anatsui's latest monumental work opens in the cavernous Turbine Hall at Tate Modern in London. Titled "Behind the Red Moon," it evokes the celestial and the maritime. Come down the entry ramp and an immense red-on-red sail with a central orb billows over your head. Its back unfurls in shades of yellow. At the far end, another sheet dips to the ground, dark like a looming shore. In between, panels of silvery diaphanous rings glitter in the light; they suggest human figures and come together to form a globe.
Twenty-five years after Anatsui's roadside intuition, his bottle-cap compositions still reward and elude. Grand but down-to-earth, they exude sensuousness and sweep, yet, on approach, grow prickly and particular. They invite close looking -- for the sheer craft, but also for insights, in their weave of recirculated materials, about the world we live in. With its navigational theme and the fact that it is on view in London, "Behind the Red Moon," which Anatsui conceived working with the Tate curators Osei Bonsu and Dina Akhmadeeva, carries allusions to colonial trade and empire while operating through metaphor.
For the Princeton University art historian Chika Okeke-Agulu -- an Anatsui expert who helped organize a major 2019 Munich retrospective -- Anatsui has done nothing less than reinvent sculpture.
"When you look at these gossamer structures in space, monumental in scale yet so fragile, that paradoxical invocation of power and poetry, it's hard to find equivalents," Okeke-Agulu said. "It's a completely new proposition."
IN LATE AUGUST, I met Anatsui in the new studio he has built in Tema, the port city near Accra, Ghana's capital. Born and raised in Ghana, Anatsui spent 45 years in Nigeria before returning two years ago.
Tema is a utilitarian place, a planned city with a container terminal, oil refinery and aluminum smelter. Anatsui's studio sits near the main highway, neighboring low-slung warehouses, the truck yard for a cement company and a home-goods superstore. When I arrived, Anatsui, 79, was working with 10 assistants on new works.
Even a small Anatsui piece fetches hundreds of thousands of dollars; his metal works were among the first pieces of African contemporary art to clear the million-dollar bar, setting key market benchmarks and building value for cohorts of young artists behind him.
The proceeds sustain a whole economy. Anatsui's materials are inexpensive, but he requires huge quantities. The work is immensely labor-intensive and now straddles two countries. Between Ghana and his larger studio in Nigeria, he employs nearly 100 people.
I watched Anatsui review sections of bottle-cap weave laid on the floor of a hexagonal atelier. Two assistants worked at a small table puncturing aluminum pieces with wood awls -- the tedious fundamental labor.
The sections on the floor shimmered in gold, silver, purple, yellow. Some were streaked with contrasting colors and forms; others had multiple layers.
More developed pieces hung on the studio walls. As we considered a jagged rectangle composition about 10 feet wide, made of deep reds and softer pinks with an irregular gold central field, I asked Anatsui how he knew a work was finished.
"It has to hang on the wall a certain time and undergo scrutiny and reflection," he said. He asked me to interpret the piece: "Can you see anything?"
I hesitated. "When people ask that, you will start to think there is something there," he said. The work was entirely abstract. "There is nothing there."
Anatsui, whom everyone calls "Prof," is soft-spoken and witty. The more analytic the point, the more likely he will offset it with a chuckle or wry smile.
His art comes pre-loaded with meaning. Sorted into crates and sacks in the studio, the caps and foils -- from alcohol, other drinks, medicines -- suggest a kind of material sociology of daily life, consumption and commerce. He still obtains them mostly in Nigeria but is building his Ghana circuits; minor local differences in products and tastes could ramify through his artwork into new colors and patterns.
In societies where adaptive reuse is the norm, Anatsui rejects the premise of trash. Consider the foil buffet trays at weddings or funerals, he said, which can be smelted back into cooking pots. "We are not working with waste material, because there are other people who use them for other things," he said. Art is one option in the cycle.
He is keenly conscious of his own work's industrial organization -- particularly now that its supply chain crosses countries. The Nsukka studio produces works up to the point where his eye and touch are needed. Folded into crates, they are shipped by DHL to Tema, from where the finished pieces head out into the world.
In designing the Turbine Hall work, Anatsui said, he had in mind the trans-Atlantic triangular trade in enslaved people and plantation commodities -- particularly sugar, which built the wealth of Henry Tate, the museum's 19th-century patron. In a sense, he said, Nsukka to Tema to London "replicates a triangle in the way the whole work comes about."
But he keeps a space now at Tema port, to generate fresh ideas near the docks and vessels. The setting, he said, "offers new challenges and opportunities to me as an artist."
THEY MISS HIM in Nsukka.
"You can say that again," said Chijioke Onuora, a former student of Anatsui who is now a fine art professor at the University of Nigeria.
Anatsui arrived there in 1975 and became a fixture for 45 years. He impressed students with his nontraditional assignments, and by "doing the kind of art that was a little weird to us," said Onuora, who studied with him in the early 1980s. "He would tell us to find something common and experiment with ways to make it into interesting sculptures."
Nsukka, in eastern Nigeria, was no ordinary college town. After the Biafran war ended in 1970, it attracted intellectuals, notably the novelist Chinua Achebe. The painter and sculptor Uche Okeke oriented the university's art program toward "natural synthesis," his term for modern art that drew on local and traditional aesthetics and knowledge.
At a time when writers and artists around Africa craved ways to ally their colonially shaped training and study in the Western tradition with the local cultures it disparaged or ignored, Nsukka offered a community and institutional home.
Anatsui had trained conventionally, at a university in Ghana. But in the early 1970s, while teaching in Winneba, a coastal town west of Accra, he began working on round wooden trays that were common in markets there, and into which he began burning his adaptations of Adinkra symbols, which express social concepts and proverbs.
When Anatsui joined the faculty in Nsukka, his art grew to encompass many media -- wood, ceramics, printmaking. He created wood pieces lined up like xylophone keys that could be shown in many sequences, which earned him notice abroad -- including the 1990 Venice Biennale. He broke and reassembled ceramic vessels. He made art from local practical objects, including wood mortars and iron cassava graters.
Thanks to Anatsui, Onuora said, "it dawned on everybody that anything at all could be used to make a sculptural statement."
Anatsui's international visibility, which grew in the 1990s before the bottle-cap works turbocharged it, offered ballast against the vagaries of Nigeria -- the years of dictatorship and economic crisis that pushed many peers and students to emigrate. Nevertheless, Anatsui told me, he bought land in Ghana as early as 1999, sensing the time would come.
In Nsukka, Onuora said, the view was that Anatsui might never have left, were it not for escalating insecurity in the region, notably kidnappings for ransom.
But when I asked Anatsui what motivated his decision, he emphasized the importance of change, and the duties of age. "As an artist, you need to have a variety of experiences," he said. "And growing old, you need to establish something at home. "
THE NEXT DAY, I met Anatsui on the Accra-Tema highway, well before dawn to beat the traffic. We were headed to Anyako -- his ancestral town, where he was born, on a lagoon peninsula near the border with Togo.
Anatsui is investing. In Tema, a huge studio extension, two-thirds the size of a football field, is nearly complete. It will have areas for wood sculpture -- which Anatsui never stopped doing -- and metal, ceramics, even a sound studio.
But in Anyako his mission is personal. Even as a child, he told me, he was rarely there, because he was raised by an uncle who was a pastor in other towns. He did not know much about home, he said, but was always soothed by the breeze on the lagoon.
Now he shows up -- to the weddings, the funerals, the naming ceremonies. He has purchased land next to a nephew's home -- Anatsui himself is a lifelong bachelor -- and intends to build a cultural center. The lagoon is overfished, unemployment is soaring; culture, he said, should bring value.
"Before long I'll be living here," he said. "It's not good to just come and live in the world and go, and not leave any contribution."
At the waterside we entered long wood canoes and crossed the lagoon. Returning, we had the wind at our backs. The boatmen roped the canoes together, then raised a mast -- a Y-shape arrangement of two branches -- and a sail made from flour sacks.
Nothing was wasted. The perfect sculpture billowed us home.

Looming Strike Spurs Supply Chain Woes: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Businesses around the country are facing what could be the latest disruption to how they get their goods to their customers in a timely and affordable fashion.
Kathryn Keeler and her husband, Stuart de Haaff, own an olive oil company in the hills of central California. The couple spend their days harvesting olives, bottling the oil, labeling the glass bottles and shipping them out, relying primarily on UPS to get their product to kitchens throughout the United States.
They are far from alone. UPS handles about a fourth of packages shipped each day in the United States, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index, many of them for small businesses like Ms. Keeler's company, Rancho Azul y Oro.
But with the labor contract between UPS and 325,000 of its workers expiring at the end of the month and a potential strike looming, business owners around the country are facing what could be the latest in a series of supply chain disruptions they have confronted since the start of the pandemic.
Some are pre-emptively turning to FedEx, the next largest private carrier in the United States, or the Postal Service. Others are calling their third-party shippers -- firms that work with the likes of UPS, FedEx and DHL to handle their clients' shipping needs -- to ensure that their packages can still get to their final destinations even if there is a strike.
The logistical challenge is just one more burden on businesses that have been stretched thin over the past few years.
"Maybe a larger business can withstand those types of situations," Ms. Keeler said. But as small-business owners, she and her husband "don't have a lot of extra time in our day to be on the phone with the post office or FedEx."
Since 2020, the pandemic has strained the global supply chain in a number of ways. E-commerce reached record levels as stuck-at-home Americans bought clothes, furniture, workout equipment and groceries online. Companies had to navigate Covid-related shutdowns at factories in China and Vietnam. There were worldwide delays when a large container ship got stuck in the Suez Canal, leading to containers piling up at the Port of Los Angeles. Those situations affected the way goods came into the United States.
A UPS strike could hobble the way brands move their wares domestically.
"This is something that affects us on our home turf, and how do we solve for that?" said Ron Robinson, the chief executive of BeautyStat Cosmetics, which uses UPS to ship its skin care products to retailers like Ulta and Macy's.
One strategy that his team will lean on is trying to bundle packages, sending as many as it can out at once, he said.
Switching to another carrier is going to cost some companies.
Ryan Culver, the chief executive of Platterful, a monthly charcuterie board subscription service, also uses UPS. Switching over to FedEx Express -- necessary to ensure that the meats in his packages reach consumers in time -- would cost about $ 5 to $ 10 more per delivery.
Teri Johnson, the founder of Harlem Candle Company, received an email on June 26 from her third-party shipper about a potential UPS strike. It suggested she switch to FedEx. That will cost her about $ 2 extra for each candle shipped in the greater New York area. Sending her candles to California will cost even more.
"We don't really have a choice right now," Ms. Johnson said.
FedEx said it was accepting additional volume for a limited time and would assess how much capacity its network could accommodate. "Shippers who are considering shifting volume to FedEx, or are currently in discussions with the company to open a new account, are encouraged to begin shipping with FedEx now," the company said in a post on its website on Thursday.
The Postal Service said in an emailed statement that it "has a strong network, and we have the capacity to deliver what is tendered to us."
Larger companies are relying on sophisticated backup plans that have been tested over the past few years. The pandemic and previous tariff trade wars pushed many major retailers with global supply chains to diversify the countries where their vendors are and the parcel carriers they use.
"We've been focused on investing in a lot of transportation solutions that allow us to more nimbly move freight between carriers," said Alexis DePree, the chief supply chain officer at Nordstrom. "We can do that with a lot more flexibility and speed than we were able to in the past."
Some third-party carriers are seeing a boost in their businesses as the possibility of a UPS strike comes into focus for their clients. Stord, a third-party logistics and technology provider based in Atlanta whose clients include apparel makers and consumer-package companies, has been sending emails out telling its clients not to worry. Stord uses a cloud-based platform to offer services like warehousing and fulfillment and handles tens of thousands of their packages a day.
By combining the volume of its broad portfolio of client brands and using software to make decisions, Stord has the leverage to better negotiate prices with the large parcel carriers, said Sean Henry, the company's chief executive.
"We've been negotiating with FedEx and U.S.P.S. about rates around UPS so our customers don't have to do that," he said.
Stord said more of its clients had asked it to negotiate with carriers on their behalf. He said that equated to "tens of millions of dollars of annual revenue" for his business.
Still, some business owners are not letting the possibility of a UPS strike stress them out just yet.
Bill McHenry, president of Widgeteer, which sells cookware to large retailers, said he felt "kind of numb" after navigating the pandemic-related challenges. "I've seen a lot of stuff and the stories that I've heard and things we've had to go through and survive -- not just the pricing but the upheaval of thinking you have a container but don't," he said.
He said the potential rail strike last December had been a bigger concern for him.
In the meantime, the possibility that a deal could be reached between UPS and the union that represents its workers, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, remains. The union announced on Wednesday that negotiations had broken down, after previously saying the sides had reached a tentative agreement. If an agreement is not reached, a strike could happen as early as Aug. 1.
If that occurs, "we would be collateral damage," Ms. Keeler said.

David Gilmour, 91, an Entrepreneur Who Put Fiji Water in Square Bottles: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An entrepreneur for more than 50 years, he built a luxurious club in Fiji and started a bottled water company, now the second-largest imported water brand in the United States.
David Gilmour, a Canadian-born entrepreneur who in the 1990s built a luxury resort on Wakaya, a tiny island he owned in Fiji, and then created Fiji Natural Artesian Water, turning a local resource into a leading bottled brand, died on June 11 in Manhattan. He was 91.
The cause was cardiac arrest, said David Roth, a friend and business partner.
By the time he bought Wakaya from two business partners in 1987, Mr. Gilmour had built several businesses over 30 years. He imported Scandinavian home furnishings and built high-end stereos. He helped assemble a chain of hotels in the South Pacific, which made him familiar with the archipelago nation of Fiji, and he co-founded a gold-mining company.
But there was something different about Wakaya. At the time, he was mourning the death of his only child, Erin Gilmour, who had been murdered in her apartment in Toronto in 1983.
He called the island "the last bastion of sanity in the world," his wife, Jillian (Sweeney) Gilmour, said in a phone interview. "He thought when everything went kerflooey, this is where he would go.
"The island itself is so beautiful," she continued. "There's an area called Chieftain's Leap, with soaring cliffs, where peregrine falcons make their nests."
In 1990, Mr. Gilmour opened the Wakaya Club & Spa, a cluster of eight free-standing suites on a former coconut plantation. At the time, he said, he opened it as "really just a place where my friends, those I can't put up in my own home, can come and share the peace." He added: "I don't see it as terribly commercial, frankly. It will probably only break even."
It nonetheless became popular with celebrities, including Tom Cruise, Bill and Melinda Gates (who spent part of their honeymoon there) and Keith Richards, who fell out of a palm tree there in 2006 and was flown to a hospital in New Zealand with a head injury.
One day in the 1990s, Mr. Gilmour saw guests at the property drinking Evian water.
"He said, 'There's something wrong with this picture,' and I said, "What do you mean?"' Ms. Gilmour said. "And he said, 'We're on our own island, and they're drinking water from Lake Geneva. I know that with Fiji's rainfall, there must be a greater water source."'
Mr. Gilmour learned of an underground aquifer beneath the volcanic highlands of the Fijian island of Viti Levu, with water rich in the mineral silica. In 1996, his company began packaging and shipping its distinctive square bottles around the world.
Mr. Gilmour said the water's purity was the result of Fiji's geographic remoteness. "There's no acid rain, no industrial pollution, no pesticides," he told The Palm Beach Post of Florida in 1998. "It's the purest virgin ecosystem."
Fiji is now the second-largest imported water brand in the United States (after San Pellegrino), according to the Beverage Marketing Corporation.
David Harrison Gilmour was born on Nov. 5, 1931, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and grew up in Toronto. His father, Adam Gilmour, was an investment banker, and his mother, Doris Godson Gilmour, was an opera singer.
Mr. Gilmour studied business management for a year at the University of Toronto. He then accepted his father's offer of a $ 10-a-day stipend to travel through Europe, which he did for a while before returning to Canada.
"I learned what people are really like," he told Palm Beach Illustrated in 2015. "I learned to touch only what I totally believe in 100 percent. And I learned how to take care of myself."
He turned down his father's offer to join his bank and instead moved to Montreal, where he sold pots and pans door to door for a year.
His first business was importing modern, streamlined Scandinavian housewares and furnishings. He followed that in 1958 with the start-up Clairtone Sound, a collaboration with Peter Munk, a Hungarian-born electrical engineer. The company made critically acclaimed, sophisticated hi-fi systems whose buyers included Frank Sinatra and Hugh Hefner. But it foundered after branching into televisions and shifting operations, disastrously, to Nova Scotia.
Amid steep losses, Mr. Gilmour and Mr. Munk were forced out of the company in 1968 and later settled a lawsuit claiming that they sold shares before the announcement of poor quarterly results in 1967.
They recovered quickly and in 1969 started Southern Pacific Properties, which accumulated more than 50 hotels in Australia and New Zealand as well as in Fiji, New Caledonia, Tahiti and other islands. An ambitious development that was to be built near the pyramids in Giza, Egypt, was eventually nixed by President Anwar Sadat in 1978.
Three years later, Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat, a Singaporean banker, purchased Southern Pacific for a reported $ 130 million. But Wakaya remained separately owned by Mr. Gilmour and his partners, until Mr. Gilmour bought them out.
In the early 1980s, Mr. Gilmour and Mr. Munk were among the original partners in Barrick Gold, one of the world's largest gold producers. Mr. Munk was its longtime chairman and chief executive, and Mr. Gilmour was a board member until 2001. Mr. Munk died in 2018.
Mr. Gilmour described his working relationship with Mr. Munk in 2008 with The Globe and Mail of Toronto. "I am more the entrepreneurial type who likes challenges of starting up, and Peter loves growing a colossus," he said. "Once it reaches a critical mass, I kind of get bored sitting around a boardroom table."
Fiji Water, marketed as a luxury brand, was a major commercial success. But, like other brands, it drew scorn from environmentalists, who criticized the industry for the amount of energy it consumed and the greenhouse gases created in making and shipping plastic bottles, and for the plastic waste they leave behind. Fiji, in particular, was singled out for shipping water to consumers thousands of miles away.
Mr. Gilmour sold Fiji Water to Roll International in 2004, and Wakaya to Clare Bronfman, an heir to the Seagram's liquor fortune, in 2016, after a Category 5 cyclone devastated the island. "We sold it for 10 cents on the dollar," Ms. Gilmour said. In 2020, Ms. Bronfman was sentenced to prison for her role in enabling the Nxivm sex cult.
Mr. Gilmour's wife is his only immediate survivor. His marriages to Anna Wilmot, Erin's mother, and to Diane Williams ended in divorce. He lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach.
Mr. Gilmour, who sold his Palm Beach estate last year for $ 44.9 million, had one last company in his portfolio at his death: Wakaya Perfection, a wellness company that sells powders and capsules of ginger and turmeric grown in volcanic soil in Fiji and Nicaragua.
"David had this belief that organic, single-source, very pure, high-quality ginger and turmeric would be something that people wanted," Mr. Roth, who started the company with Mr. Gilmour, said by phone. "And Oprah chose it twice as one of her favorite things."

Annual 93,000-Mile, 20-Country Relay Race That Fans Don't See: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- By late Sunday night in Baku, a few hours after Sergio Pérez of Red Bull had won the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, much of the equipment necessary to stage a Formula 1 race had been methodically packed, wrapped and hoisted onto pallets, ready to fly halfway across the world.
Chartered cargo planes did the heavy lifting from there, hauling disassembled 1,700-pound racecars -- and almost anything else imaginable -- to Miami International Airport, where, by Monday, the shipment had been offloaded onto trucks and delivered to the pop-up racetrack around Hard Rock Stadium, which will host the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday.
Getting from the starting grid to the finish line is not, it turns out, the only high-stakes race against the clock in Formula 1.
For the top tier of international open-wheel racing, putting on premier competitions on back-to-back weekends is a complicated logistical symphony. Behind the scenes, 1,400 tons of stuff travels by air, sea and land from track to track, and continent to continent, for 23 races in 20 countries, a perpetual cycle of packing, unpacking and repacking that this year will cover more than 93,000 miles. The lights' flicking off at the start of each race are contingent on everything, somehow, arriving on time, every time.
It is not just the cars that need to be taken apart and put back together just so. It is entire garages, plus the technical gear and hospitality amenities -- even the weather instruments -- that make up essentially a modest city's worth of necessities large and small that need to be packed up. Tires, fuel, generators. Helmets and baseball hats. Broadcast equipment. Cutlery. On rare occasions, plants.
"In some cases, we bring the ovens and dishwashers," said Simon Price, the trackside manager for the shipping giant DHL, which has been moving cargo for Formula 1 for decades and been its official logistics provider since 2004.
Planes transport the most important -- read: most expensive -- cargo from one race to the next, Price said. The planes flying in from Baku this week stopped to refuel either in Casablanca, Morocco, or Luxembourg before their arrival in Miami. (Yes, everything must clear customs. A lot of paperwork is involved.) The last plane touched down Tuesday afternoon.
This week, the teams were lucky, said Christian Polhammer, the senior logistics coordinator for F1: Miami's time zone was eight hours behind.
"That eight hours make a big difference," he said. "If you go the other way, you lose eight hours."
Ships lug sets of bulkier items to nonconsecutive races. The first vessel with Miami race containers arrived at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in mid-April. By Wednesday, unpacked boxes lay neatly in front of each team's garages: "Sea shipment to Miami, Montreal, Austin, Las Vegas," read a label outside Red Bull's quarters.
Locally sourced and labeled forklifts -- Ferrari 1, Ferrari 6 -- motored to and from garages, beeping warnings as they came and went. Crews in team uniforms unwrapped cases of rims. Outside the Red Bull garage, two men inserted sensors into huge Pirelli tires.
The garages themselves, where the racecars were being reassembled by crew members blaring music, were off limits to outsiders, for competitive reasons. Practice laps were only a few days away. But no one seemed frazzled. They do this almost every week.
Last year, bad weather and vessel congestion delayed a ship in Singapore that had been headed to the Australian Grand Prix, Price said. With the clock ticking down to practices and qualifying, DHL diverted three planes and urgently sent employees to Singapore to unpack the sea freight containers and hustle the cargo into airfreight ones. Everything made it to Melbourne.
But people like Polhammer and Price cannot focus on just a single race at a time. Interviewed in Miami, they were already thinking about upcoming competitions, especially the one later this month in Monaco, where the narrow streets, Price noted with concern, "aren't built for trucks."
The Las Vegas Grand Prix, scheduled to debut in November, will present an altogether different challenge, Polhammer said. As soon as it ends, everything will have to be packed up and flown to Abu Dhabi, which is 11 hours ahead. It will help that the Vegas race will be on a Saturday night rather than the traditional Sunday slot, he added.
But he can worry about that later, after the long hauls to Britain, Belgium and Brazil.
With this year's season running from March to November and requiring travel across five continents, people like Polhammer and Price spend most of their time on planes and in hotel rooms. Price, who lives in England and began his career as a Formula 1 truck driver, estimated he gets about two days a month at home. Polhammer, who lives in Austria and has worked for F1 for 16 years, said that last year he spent more than 260 nights on the road.
"I admire and take my hat off to anyone that holds down a family and a relationship with this job," Price said.
It is difficult to explain to people outside the logistics business what they do. "They're all like, 'What a glamorous lifestyle!"' Polhammer said. "We are definitely not part of that."
No other sport compares in terms of moving so much volume over such long distances in short periods of times, he added.
"F1 -- its deadlines do not move," Price said. In normal commerce, he added, schedules can be adjusted. In Formula 1, "the green flag will go on Sunday no matter what."
Then the packing will begin again, even before the champagne is sprayed on the podium.
"It takes three to four days to set all this up," Price said, "and we pack it down in three to four hours."

Seaweed Is Hot. Can It Thrive as Planet Warms?: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For centuries, it's been treasured in kitchens in Asia and neglected almost everywhere else: Those glistening ribbons of seaweed that bend and bloom in cold ocean waves.
Today, seaweed is suddenly a hot global commodity. It's attracting new money and new purpose in all kinds of new places because of its potential to help tame some of the hazards of the modern age, not least climate change.
In London, a start-up is making a plastic substitute out of seaweed. In Australia and Hawaii, others are racing to grow seaweed that, when fed to livestock, can cut methane from cow burps. Researchers are studying just how much carbon dioxide can be sequestered by seaweed farms, as investors eye them as a new source of carbon credits for polluters to offset their greenhouse gas emissions.
And in South Korea, one of the most established seaweed growing countries in the world, farmers are struggling to keep up with growing export demand.
But even as its champions see it as a miracle crop for a hotter planet, others worry that the zeal to farm the ocean could replicate some of the same damages of farming on land. Much is unknown about how seaweed farms, particularly those far offshore, can affect marine ecosystems.
"Seaweed protagonists believe seaweed is a cure to everything, that seaweed is a magical panacea for climate problems," said David Koweek, chief scientist for Ocean Visions, a consortium of research organizations studying ocean-based interventions for the climate crisis. "Seaweed antagonists think seaweed is completely overhyped."
There's another problem. Seaweed is itself feeling the impact of climate change, particularly in Asia.
"The water is way too hot," said Sung-kil Shin, a third-generation seaweed farmer, as he pulled his boat into harbor one morning on Soando Island, just south of the South Korean mainland, where seaweed has long been foraged and farmed.
'Plastic' from seaweed
Pierre Paslier once made a living by designing plastic packages for cosmetics. It felt to him like "leasing out my brain to a big plastic polluter."
He wanted out. He wanted to create packaging that would come from nature and disappear into nature, quickly. With a friend from graduate school, Rodrigo García González, he created a company called NotPla, short for "not plastic."
From an East London warehouse, they designed an edible sachet of water, made of seaweed and other plant extracts: To drink the water you simply pop the sachet in your mouth. They designed another one that can hold ketchup and a third for cosmetics.
They also began making a seaweed-based coating for takeout cardboard boxes. Just Eat, a food delivery app in Britain, began using it for some of its orders, including at the European women's soccer finals in July at Wembley Stadium.
It's still niche. The seaweed coating, designed for home composting bins, is considerably more expensive than the plastic coating now used on most takeout boxes made of paper.
But Mr. Paslier is looking to the future. The European Union has a new law restricting single-use plastic. A global plastics treaty is under negotiation.
"Seaweed is not going to replace all plastic, but seaweed combined with other things can tackle single use plastic," he said. "We are barely scratching the surface."
Foragers from the past
In the gray light of dawn, Soon-ok Goh, a slight 71-year-old, swam soundlessly in the shallow waters of Gijang, on the southern coast of South Korea. Her feet were sheathed in yellow flippers, her thin, small frame in a wetsuit. She surfaced above water for a few seconds, took a long breath that sounded almost like a whistle in the quiet of the morning, then dived down again, yellow flippers upturned.
Ms. Goh is among the last practitioners of a vanishing trade. Since the end of the 7th century, women like her have foraged for wild seaweed, along with other seafood, in the chilly waters around the Korean Peninsula.
This morning, a tiny pink-handled knife in hand, she snipped shiny green-brown ribbons of kelp called miyeok. She plucked sea snails clinging to rocks, two kinds of sea cucumbers, a handful of kelp-devouring sea urchins.
All went into her sack.
What role seaweed plays in your life depends on where you're from.
For Alaska's Indigenous people, seaweed has been a source of sustenance for generations. The Irish and Welsh have used it to make pudding. Japanese soup stock is made of kelp. Seaweed extracts also help millions of people worldwide keep their teeth clean; it's been used to make toothpaste for years.
In Korea, bordered by water on three sides, 20 different species of seaweed have been recorded. It is central to cuisine and culture.
After childbirth, mothers are served a soup made of miyeok, iron-rich and brown, and children are served it on their birthdays to honor mothers. Dried, salted sheets of gim are eaten as snacks or dusted over cookies. Wispy tendrils of maesaengi are tucked into a steamy breakfast porridge that's believed to be a hangover cure.
In decades past, when there was no money to buy rice, you could go to the sea and find seaweed, said Hye Kyung Jeong, a food historian at Hoseo University in Seoul. "Seaweed helped people survive during famines," she said.
This is not the first time seaweed has helped avert a crisis.
Slimy arms race
The new frontier for seaweed production lies beyond Asia.
Steve Meller, an American businessman in Australia, grows seaweed in giant glass tanks on land. Specifically, a red seaweed native to the waters around Australia called asparagopsis, which beef and dairy companies are eyeing as a way to meet their climate goals.
A sprinkle of asparagopsis in cattle feed can cut methane from their burps by between 82 and 98 percent, according to several independent studies.
"The race is on, I suppose, to get the world's first commercial supply," Mr. Meller said. "The demand is off-the-roof scale."
Fonterra, a New Zealand dairy producer, has begun commercial trials of the seaweed supplement, and Ben and Jerry's is planning its own trials soon. The global dairy giant Danone has invested in an asparagopsis start-up.
Whether seaweed can make a dent in cattle methane remains unclear. In the United States, there's another hurdle to overcome: regulatory approval.
Nevertheless, it could be key to the beef and dairy industry's ability to meet climate goals. Emissions from food systems alone, mainly meat and dairy, could raise the global average temperature by 1 degree Celsius by the end of the century, blowing past the threshold of relatively safe global warming, researchers have said.
Climate pressures
Seabirds dive and squawk around the fishing port in Soando, an island off the southern tip of South Korea, as Mr. Shin's boat pulls in with the morning's harvest.
Mr. Shin, 44, has plied these waters for 20 years and has seen climate change upend his trade. He grows a red kelp species called pyropia, which favors cold water during its growing season. So he has been going further and further from shore in search of chilly waves.
By mid-April, Mr. Shin says, the water isn't as cold as Pyropia likes. His yield has suffered. "People want more seaweed these days," he said. "But there's no more seaweed."
Since 1968, the waters where Mr. Shin farms have warmed by 1.4 degrees Celsius, slightly higher than the global average. That's why South Korean scientists are racing to breed strains that can thrive in warmer waters.
Seaweed farms are a far cry from the rows of corn and wheat that make up monoculture farming on land. But even as they signify new opportunities, they present ecological risks, many of them unknown.
They could block sunlight to creatures who need it below. They could scatter plastic buoys in the sea, which already suffers from too much plastic. They could leave their plant detritus on the seafloor, altering the marine ecosystem.
"It needs to be carried out with a great deal of care," said Scott Pillias, a doctoral student in economics who studies marine systems at the University of Queensland. "We shouldn't expect seaweed to save us."

For centuries, it’s been treasured in kitchens in Asia and neglected almost everywhere else: those glistening ribbons of seaweed that bend and bloom in cold ocean waves.
Today, seaweed is suddenly a hot global commodity. It’s attracting new money and new purpose in all kinds of new places because of its potential to help tame some of the hazards of the modern age, not least climate change.
In London, a startup is making a plastic substitute out of seaweed. In Australia and Hawaii, others are racing to grow seaweed that, when fed to livestock, can cut methane from cow burps. Researchers are studying just how much carbon dioxide can be sequestered by seaweed farms as investors eye them as a new source of carbon credits for polluters to offset their greenhouse gas emissions.
And in South Korea, one of the most established seaweed-growing countries in the world, farmers are struggling to keep up with growing export demand.
What was mainly a relatively small Asian industry is now coveted by the West. Far beyond South Korea, new farms have cropped up in Maine, the Faeroe Islands, Australia, even the North Sea. Globally, seaweed production has grown by nearly 75% in the past decade. The focus is moving far beyond its traditional use in cuisine.
But even as its champions see it as a miracle crop for a hotter planet, others worry that the zeal to farm the ocean could replicate some of the same damages of farming on land. Much is unknown about how seaweed farms, particularly those far offshore, can affect marine ecosystems.
“Seaweed protagonists believe seaweed is a cure to everything, that seaweed is a magical panacea for climate problems,” said David Koweek, chief scientist for Ocean Visions, a consortium of research organizations studying ocean-based interventions for the climate crisis. “Seaweed antagonists think seaweed is completely overhyped.”
There’s another problem. Seaweed is itself feeling the impact of climate change, particularly in Asia.
“The water is way too hot,” said Sung-kil Shin, a third-generation seaweed farmer, as he pulled his boat into harbor one morning on Soando Island, just south of the South Korean mainland, where seaweed has long been foraged and farmed.
‘Plastic’ From Seaweed
Pierre Paslier once made a living by designing plastic packages for cosmetics. It felt to him like “leasing out my brain to a big plastic polluter.”
He wanted out. He wanted to create packaging that would come from nature and disappear into nature, quickly. With a friend from graduate school, Rodrigo García González, he created a company called NotPla, short for “not plastic.”
From an East London warehouse, they designed an edible sachet of water, made of seaweed and other plant extracts: To drink the water, you simply pop the sachet in your mouth. They designed another one that can hold ketchup and a third for cosmetics.
They also began making a seaweed-based coating for takeout cardboard boxes. Just Eat, a food delivery app in Britain, began using it for some of its orders, including at the European women’s soccer finals in July at Wembley Stadium.
It’s still niche. The seaweed coating, designed for home composting bins, is considerably more expensive than the plastic coating now used on most takeout boxes made of paper.
But Paslier is looking to the future. The European Union has a new law restricting single-use plastic. A global plastics treaty is under negotiation.
“Seaweed is not going to replace all plastic, but seaweed combined with other things can tackle single-use plastic,” he said. “We are barely scratching the surface.”
Foragers From the Past
In the gray light of dawn, Soon-ok Goh, a slight 71-year-old, swam soundlessly in the shallow waters of Gijang, on the southern coast of South Korea. Her feet were sheathed in yellow flippers, her thin, small frame in a wet suit. She surfaced above water for a few seconds, took a long breath that sounded almost like a whistle in the quiet of the morning, then dived down again, yellow flippers upturned.
Goh is among the last practitioners of a vanishing trade. Since the end of the seventh century, women like her have foraged for wild seaweed, along with other seafood, in the chilly waters around the Korean Peninsula.
This morning, a tiny pink-handled knife in hand, she snipped shiny green-brown ribbons of kelp called miyeok. She plucked sea snails clinging to rocks, two kinds of sea cucumbers, a handful of kelp-devouring sea urchins.
All went into her sack.
Her grandmother taught her the trade, Goh said, which is known as haenyeo, or the “sea women.” She has been diving since she was 9 years old. “People who do this kind of work are disappearing,” she said. “When I’m done, no one will do it.” With demand rising, old practices are getting pushed into the past.
What role seaweed plays in your life depends on where you’re from.
For Alaska’s Indigenous people, seaweed has been a source of sustenance for generations. The Irish and Welsh have used it to make pudding. Japanese soup stock is made of kelp. Seaweed extracts also help millions of people worldwide keep their teeth clean; it’s been used to make toothpaste for years.
In Korea, bordered by water on three sides, 20 species of seaweed have been recorded. It is central to cuisine and culture.
After childbirth, mothers are served a soup made of miyeok, iron-rich and brown, and children are served it on their birthdays to honor mothers. Dried, salted sheets of gim are eaten as snacks or dusted over cookies. Wispy tendrils of maesaengi are tucked into a steamy breakfast porridge that’s believed to be a hangover cure.
In decades past, when there was no money to buy rice, you could go to the sea and find seaweed, said Hye Kyung Jeong, a food historian at Hoseo University in Seoul, South Korea. “Seaweed helped people survive during famines,” she said.
This is not the first time seaweed has helped avert a crisis.
Slimy Arms Race
The new frontier for seaweed production lies beyond Asia.
Steve Meller, an American businessperson in Australia, grows seaweed in giant glass tanks on land — specifically, a red seaweed native to the waters around Australia called asparagopsis, which beef and dairy companies are eyeing as a way to meet their climate goals.
A sprinkle of asparagopsis in cattle feed can cut methane from their burps by between 82% and 98%, according to several independent studies. Cattle burps are a major source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
“The race is on, I suppose, to get the world’s first commercial supply,” Meller said. “The demand is off-the-roof scale.”
His company, named CH4, after methane’s chemical formula, is competing to bring asparagopsis to the mouths of cows. At least two other Australian startups, Sea Forest and Rumin8, are in the seaweed-for-cattle race. So are Symbrosia and Blue Ocean Barns, both in Hawaii.
Fonterra, a New Zealand dairy producer, has begun commercial trials of the seaweed supplement, and Ben & Jerry’s is planning its own trials soon. The global dairy giant Danone has invested in an asparagopsis startup.
Whether seaweed can make a dent in cattle methane remains unclear. In the United States, there’s another hurdle to overcome: regulatory approval.
Nevertheless, it could be key to the beef and dairy industry’s ability to meet climate goals. Emissions from food systems alone, mainly meat and dairy, could raise the global average temperature by 1 degree Celsius by the end of the century, blowing past the threshold of relatively safe global warming, researchers have said.
Climate Pressures
Seabirds dive and squawk around the fishing port in Soando, an island off the southern tip of South Korea, as Shin’s boat pulls in with the morning’s harvest.
Shin, 44, has plied these waters for 20 years and has seen climate change upend his trade. He grows a red kelp species called pyropia, which favors cold water during its growing season. So he has been going further and further from shore in search of chilly waves.
By mid-April, Shin said, the water isn’t as cold as pyropia likes. His yield has suffered. “People want more seaweed these days,” he said. “But there’s no more seaweed.”
Since 1968, the waters where Shin farms have warmed by 1.4 degrees Celsius, slightly higher than the global average. That’s why South Korean scientists are racing to breed strains that can thrive in warmer waters.
Seaweed farms are a far cry from the rows of corn and wheat that make up monoculture farming on land. But even as they signify new opportunities, they present ecological risks, many of them unknown.
They could block sunlight to creatures who need it below. They could scatter plastic buoys in the sea, which already suffers from too much plastic. They could leave their plant detritus on the seafloor, altering the marine ecosystem.
“It needs to be carried out with a great deal of care,” said Scott Pillias, a doctoral student in economics who studies marine systems at the University of Queensland. “We shouldn’t expect seaweed to save us.”

Wearing the Wig Fiercely When It Was Risky: [Review]

Full text: WHO DOES THAT BITCH THINK SHE IS? Doris Fish and the Rise of Drag, by Craig Seligman
From wee-hours cabaret to prime-time reality TV to fiercely contended children's story hour at the local library, the American drag queen's journey has been a long and bumpy one.
For Doris Fish, alter ego of Philip Clargo Mills, it began not in America but Manly Vale, an apt-sounding suburb of Sydney, Australia, and ended in AIDS-ravaged San Francisco, 1991 -- with resurrection, one source maintains, as a ghost composed variously of golden sparks and Evian water.
I had not known of Fish before reading the journalist Craig Seligman's minutely observed new biography of him (though some friends used the female pronoun, "he never wanted to be a woman -- he never even wanted to seem like a woman," the author writes). I finished it persuaded this was a life well worth examining, if only because his peers are so often celebrated, or excoriated, in aggregate.
Most of Fish's performances are unrecoverable, but those that can be scratched up are indelible. Best known, in a limited way, is probably "Vegas in Space," a posthumously released and deeply weird 1991 sci-fi comedy about male earthlings who undergo sex-change operations so they can travel to a female-only planet (something about recovering stolen jewels...).
Promoting the movie during its production period on a Pittsburgh morning show in 1986, Fish gamely endures being treated like a talking zoo animal by the gawking hosts and awkwardly grinning housewives. There's also a choppy video out there of his swan song, "This Is My Life," fervidly performed in a caftan and satin gloves at the benefit from which the book takes its name. He was months from death.
Born in 1952, Philip was a middle child of six in a tolerant Catholic family that permitted a marijuana plant on the premises. He played a high-kicking chorus girl under a priest's tutelage at his all-boy school's year-end musical with more enthusiasm than most of his classmates. Remarkably indifferent to the prospect of arrest or social censure, he joined a local troupe called Sylvia and the Synthetics whose outré antics had me scrawling exclamation points in the margins.
One female impersonator's considerable male member was tucked through his legs to simulate a tail. Another pinned back her hair with swastikas. Another bit into a dripping sheep's heart to punctuate a lovelorn ballad, blood dripping onto her ball gown like one of the less tasteful Valentine's Day bitmojis. There were flash mobs of Marilyn Monroe impersonators and teetering pyramids of performers on quaaludes. "Everything was permitted," Seligman writes dryly, "including ineptitude."
After working for the Florence Broadhurst wallpaper factory, from which he filched metallic powders for his cosmetics, Philip/Doris moved to San Francisco, money sewn into his pockets by his loving mother, Mildred, and found his true calling. Mostly this was what was then called prostitution, though in Fish's hands it seems more like a kind of sexual nursing. He specialized in relations with those society often rejected, the obese or infirm. (There was a green-card marriage to a lesbian, one of the few survivors of his circle who declined to be interviewed here.)
He acted as "comedy model" for a greeting-card company called West Graphic, portraits that Seligman compares to the work of Cindy Sherman. He wrote a popular column for The San Francisco Sentinel, then an essential gay weekly. And he performed in a group called Sluts a-Go-Go, emulating faded stars of the '30s and '40s while occasionally brushing up against rising ones (Robin Williams, Lynda Carter). The Sluts and their associates were equal-opportunity offenders, doing racial as well as gender impressions, spewing double entendre and sometimes seeming to positively assault their audiences with sensory overload, exaggerated glamour and flagrant disregard for safety codes.
Though revolutionary in his in-your-faceness, Fish was not particularly political; the sincerity such activity requires was anathema. One of the more intriguing aspects of his foreshortened life was an attitude described here as Romantic Cruelism: a pose of complete indifference or dark humor even in the face of tragedy.
Fish displays it when his parents divorce; when a younger sister dies after a mysterious illness; and when one Synthetic, who had been a childhood friend, perishes in a fire: "Burnt to a cinder in a room full of exotic drag. All they found was a tooth," as Spurt!, a local punk zine, callously memorialized. "The young don't know what to do with endings," Seligman writes, and there were so many more to come.
"Who Does That Bitch Think She Is?" revisits and draws from a 1986 profile of Fish that Seligman wrote for skittish editors at Image magazine, a weekend section of The San Francisco Examiner. Aside from overuse of the words "notoriety" and "notorious," it is confidently written, wistful and quite personal; Seligman's now-husband, Silvana Nova, was part of Fish's scene.
The author of a previous book comparing Pauline Kael and Susan Sontag, Seligman diverts here and there to Sontag's "Notes on 'Camp,"' but spends most of his time simply retracing Fish's footsteps. At times these seem akin to the old Hans Christian Andersen version of "The Little Mermaid," whose heroine is granted the power to walk out of the water, but only with the pain of swords going through her. (In one parade, Fish's elaborate costume included fiberglass "legs" that drew blood from his own, covering the stains with black tights.)
Seligman's own stance is mostly one of wary wonderment, that drag queens have gone from "totally beyond the pale" to mainstream acknowledgment, "from feared freak into object of fascination," from the shaky spotlight to -- however contentiously -- the kindergarten rug. He piles a lot of historical weight on Fish's shoulders, but his subject carries it like Joan Crawford in a padded Adrian frock.

Danone Sued Over Its Plastic Use Under a Landmark Law: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Environmental groups are relying on a law in France requiring large companies to address their environmental footprint.
PARIS -- Danone, the French dairy giant, is being taken to court by three environmental groups who say it has failed to reduce its plastic footprint sufficiently, in a lawsuit challenging corporate social responsibility in the face of the climate crisis.
The groups accuse Danone -- one of the world's top 10 plastic polluters, according to a recent study -- of "failing to live up to its duties" under a groundbreaking French law that requires large companies to address their environmental impact and has opened ways to sue them should they fail to do so.
"Danone is trudging ahead without a serious plan to deal with plastics, despite clear concern from climate and health experts and consumers, and a legal obligation to face up to the issue," Rosa Pritchard, a lawyer for ClientEarth, one of the groups, said in a statement on Monday.
A spokeswoman for Danone said the company "strongly" refutes the accusation, adding that it was taking action to "reduce the use of plastic, develop reuse, reinforce collection and recycling channels, and develop alternative materials."
The lawsuit is likely to put the spotlight on the explosive growth of plastics pollution, which scientists say is affecting air and water quality, global warming, as well as human and animal life. The issue is so pressing that the United Nations last year agreed to begin writing a treaty designed to curb plastics production.
But Monday's announcement also spoke to a broader trend in environmental activism, with advocacy groups increasingly suing governments and companies in an effort to bridge the gap between their climate promises and their actual record.
Adam Weiss, ClientEarth program director for Europe, said some could see France's statute as toothless because of its vague requirements.
But, he added, "the teeth are in the lawsuits."
By suing Danone, ClientEarth and the two other groups, Surfrider Europe and Zero Waste France, are hoping to shed light on what many scientists say is a global plastic crisis whose potentially devastating effects have yet to be fully understood.
Throughout their life cycle, plastics, which are manufactured from fossil fuels, release air pollutants, harm human health and kill marine life. In 2015, they were responsible for 4.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, one recent study found, more than all of the world's airplanes combined.
Figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show that, over the past seven decades, plastics production has soared from two million metric tons (there are about 2,200 pounds per metric ton) to more than 400 million -- and is expected to almost triple by 2060.
Danone alone used more than 750,000 metric tons of plastic -- about 74 times the weight of the Eiffel Tower -- in water bottles , yogurt containers and other packaging in 2021, according to its 2021 financial report.
The company said that it reduced its plastic consumption by 12 percent from 2018 to 2021, and that it has committed to use only reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025. But Danone is not on track to reach that target, according to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which set up a voluntary program with the United Nations for big companies to address plastic pollution.
An investigation last year by the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle also highlighted Danone's shortcomings when it comes to recycled plastics.
Environmental groups also say that recycling has not proved effective at the scale necessary: Only 9 percent of all plastics ever made have been recycled, according to the United Nations, with most of the rest ending up in landfills and dumps.
"We're not going to recycle our way out of this," Mr. Weiss of ClientEarth said.
He added that plastics were too critical to Danone's business model for "voluntary mechanisms" to be effective. "We need the power of law," he said.
To sue Danone, the environmental groups have relied on the so-called duty of vigilance law, a groundbreaking piece of legislation that France passed in 2017. It requires large companies to take effective measures to identify and prevent human rights violations and environmental damages throughout their chain of activity.
Impetus for the law came from the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013, in which the collapse of a clothing factory killed more than 1,100 people in Bangladesh. Labels from famous brands were found in the rubble, casting a harsh light on the garment industry and prompting politicians and rights groups around the world to press for more corporate responsibility.
The French duty of vigilance law, the first of its kind in Europe, has since inspired similar legislation in Germany and the Netherlands, as well as a proposed European Union directive.
There is nothing like a duty of vigilance law in the United States. The Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act, which would require plastic producers to finance waste and recycling programs, and ban single-use plastic bags and the exporting of plastic waste to developing countries, is currently in committee.
However, environmental organizations have increasingly sued big plastic polluters like Coca-Cola over the past few years using mostly state-level consumer protection laws, alleging that the companies' use of single-use plastic contradicts advertising statements that they are committed to recycling and the environment.
In France, academics and rights groups say, many companies have responded to the law only by listing vague measures or some that already existed before the new obligations.
"It's often about streamlining existing practices," said Pauline Barraud de Lagerie, a sociologist at University Paris Dauphine who published a book on corporate responsibility. She added that by suing companies, "N.G.O.s are trying to somehow bring back an obligation of result."
So far, around 15 legal cases based on the French law have been reported. Half of them have gone to court and are still awaiting judgment, which could take years.
"We're making up for the government's lack of political will," said Sandra Cossart, the head of Sherpa, a group involved in four legal cases, pointing to what she described as a law lacking teeth.
The environmental groups said in their statement that Danone's 2021 vigilance plan "is completely silent on plastics." They are calling for judges in a Paris civil court to force the company to release a new plan within six months that would include a phaseout of plastics. Should the company fail to meet that deadline, they are demanding damages of 100,000 euros ( $ 108,000) per day of delay.
In September, the groups had issued formal notices to eight other major food companies accusing them of inadequate due diligence plans. ClientEarth said it had received satisfactory responses from companies such as the grocery chain Carrefour and Nestlé, which promised to step up their efforts, but not from Danone.
The lawsuit is part of a wider trend of climate litigation that has gained momentum in recent years, expanding the climate fight beyond traditional demonstrations and civil disobedience initiatives.
The number of climate change lawsuits globally has more than doubled from 2017 to 2022, from about 900 to more than 2,000 ongoing or concluded cases, according to data from the Grantham Research Institute and the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.
Catherine Higham, a researcher at the Grantham institute, said that most cases have been brought against governments, but that increasingly advocacy groups have turned their sights on corporations.
Mr. Weiss of ClientEarth said his group had been struggling to navigate corporate laws "designed to protect investors and companies" in order to press them to better address environmental issues.
"Now, we have a law designed to make companies take action for the environment," he said. "That's a step change."
