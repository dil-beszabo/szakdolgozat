Full text: The pianist Ursula Oppens will celebrate her birthday at Merkin Concert Hall with a program drawn from the large catalog of works written for her.
On a cold afternoon in early January, the pianist Ursula Oppens was making an album at Brooklyn College.
At 79, Oppens is a little fragile, tiny and stooped. But when she sat down at the piano -- shoes off, Diet Coke on the floor -- out came playing of power and technical aplomb.
Most of the time, at least. Oppens was setting down the first recording of an early, unpublished sonata by the uncompromising modernist Charles Wuorinen, and, like much of Wuorinen's music, it was treacherously thorny. She had been studying it, on and off, for a year, but it was still slow going.
"I played a couple of correct notes," she said after an early take, "but not many."
That kind of modesty has been mixed in with mastery throughout Oppens's long, distinguished career. With crystalline lucidity, warm sensitivity and utter authority, she has guided generations of listeners through the seductive complexities of Wuorinen and Elliott Carter, Anthony Davis and Conlon Nancarrow, Frederic Rzewski and Joan Tower, and on and on. She is "the queen of contemporary music," said Tania León, one of the many composers who have written for her over the last 60 years.
Born on Feb. 2, 1944, Oppens will officially celebrate her 80th birthday at Merkin Concert Hall in Manhattan on Saturday. But -- again, that modesty -- this isn't exactly an Ursula Oppens recital. She will be joined by seven pianist colleagues in a concert focused less on her than on the music she has helped bring into the world: eight pieces from her dizzying catalog.
"Most of these pieces have at least entered a small repertory," she said in an interview at her apartment on the Upper West Side. "That's what one hopes for. I don't have children, but with children you nurture them, then hope they'll go away and have their own lives. That's what I feel very proud of, and happy about, with this music."
For those who know Oppens, this self-effacement comes as no surprise. Judith Sherman, the producer of the Wuorinen album, who has worked with her for decades, said: "I don't recall her ever talking about herself or her career. If she talks about herself, it's, 'Am I failing the composer?"'
And that she very rarely does. "There's the old compliment," the composer Tobias Picker said, "'So-and-so played a better piece than the one I wrote.' That's a compliment one could give Ursula. Her phrasing, her technique, her musicality -- she's a great artist."
Oppens grew up in New York City, the child of Jewish parents who fled Europe in the late 1930s. Both were accomplished musicians; her mother, a serious pedagogue, was her first piano teacher. "When she was pregnant," Oppens said, "she had a friend come to practice the 'Hammerklavier"' -- the classic Beethoven sonata -- "so I would hear it while I was still in the womb."
She came to associate her parents with old-school technique and the canonical repertory, which she has always played alongside the new. It was much later that she learned that her mother had taken a class with Webern, the great modernist, and that her father had been a member of the influential International Society for Contemporary Music.
Oppens believes they may have associated modern styles with Europe and the war, and so didn't want to share such things with her. "I don't remember any encouragement toward new music," she said.
But she was curious from early on. Her freshman year at Radcliffe College, Pierre Boulez came to campus for lectures and a concert, and she was hooked. She played in a student performance of Stravinsky's "Les Noces"; she met the composer John Harbison, a few years older, and began to play his music; she learned Schoenberg's Phantasy for violin and piano and the Bartok sonatas.
From the beginning, modernism and its descendants entranced Oppens. "I've always been intrigued by the strangeness of it," she said. "That sort of entices me. They're adventures."
Back in New York to study at the Juilliard School in the mid-1960s, she got to know Wuorinen, an important ally when she and other young musicians formed Speculum Musicae in 1971. Mixing 20th-century standards with pieces by both established and rising composers, the ensemble was an immediate success, buoyed by Carter's advocacy.
Oppens's solo career flourished too as she won competitions and an Avery Fisher Career Grant. For the country's bicentennial, she commissioned Rzewski's labyrinthine set of variations on "The People United Will Never Be Defeated!," which has become as close to a contemporary classic as there is in the solo piano repertory.
She still performs that sprawling work, including on a program of what she calls "my standards," which places the Rzewski alongside Carter's mischievous "Two Diversions" (1999) and his brooding, unsettled "Night Fantasies" (1980).
Few pianists have mastered Carter's dauntingly quicksilver idiom like she has. Steven Beck, a former student of Oppens's who will play "Two Diversions" at Merkin, first knew of her from her recording of Carter's Piano Concerto.
"She's so attuned to the drama of it," Beck said in an interview. "The different characters of Carter's music conversing together, sometimes arguing, even at war. She would say things like, 'In this part, the two hands should fight against each other; you should feel that tension of them not agreeing.' She humanized the technical things that Carter does."
Oppens became known for her association with Carter, Wuorinen and other composers who were emblems of the so-called uptown modernist establishment centered in university music departments, as opposed to the less institutionalized "downtown" of John Cage, the Minimalists and others. But even in the days when that distinction meant something, she was open-minded.
"One of my first CDs had 'Night Fantasies' and also John Adams's 'Phrygian Gates,"' she said. "For most of my life it's been a multiplicity of styles."
Picker said that Oppens "was one of the only 'uptown' new music musicians who was open to 'downtown' music," adding that she had premiered a piece by the Minimalist composer Tom Johnson. "It was not the kind of thing we were used to."
Her abilities at nearly 80 were tested by the Wuorinen recording, and the long period of preparation for it. "The eyesight goes, the fingers," she said. "The retention. It used to be that I got memory after playing something two or three times; now it's after 20 times."
But at least one commission, a piano quintet by the 89-year-old avant-gardist Christian Wolff, is still pending. And while Oppens has made some compromises with age -- she has retired the "Hammerklavier," and made peace with never learning Ravel's challenging "Gaspard de la Nuit" -- she has no intention of retiring.
"I have very bad hand-eye coordination," she said, "so I can't play golf or tennis. But the keyboard stays the same; it doesn't move. So I'll teach and play as long as I can still do it. Every minute that I have energy, I practice."

As Social Climate Changes, D.E.I. Programs Recalibrate: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Amid a fresh backlash against D.E.I. efforts, OneTen met resistance as a program for Black workers only. It has shifted its emphasis to "equity for all" and a more hands-on approach.
Three years ago, dozens of big companies formed a coalition and declared an ambitious goal: to lift one million Black workers into good-paying jobs over the next 10 years, by hiring or promoting them.
The resulting nonprofit, OneTen, was created amid a crescendo of calls to address racial injustice after George Floyd's murder in 2020. It asked its members -- including AT&T, Bank of America, Cisco, Delta Air Lines, Dow, General Motors, Nike and Walmart -- to pledge to hire and promote Black workers based on skills instead of college degrees.
Fast-forward, and the social climate has since changed drastically. Pushing Black-only hiring programs has grown increasingly controversial, particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling last year against race-based affirmative action policies at universities.
OneTen, which has fallen far behind the pace needed to reach its initial goal, is at the forefront of a movement to adopt diversity, equity and inclusion methods in business. And it has been forced to change with the times.
The organization has modified its messaging in the past year, especially since the Supreme Court decision, to emphasize that the policies it advocates will help "Black talent and others."
More concretely, the organization's leaders realized that asking companies to vow to make changes was not enough. OneTen has helped its members rewrite job descriptions for hundreds of roles to remove unnecessary degree requirements and clearly state the skills sought and needed. The organization has helped to design apprenticeship programs for enterprises like Delta and the Cleveland Clinic, tailored for different fields. And it has set up a network for human resources and hiring managers to share their challenges and suggest solutions, in virtual and in-person sessions.
OneTen also works to establish links among employers, training programs and workers.
"The beginning has been tough -- we've learned lessons," said Kenneth Frazier, a founder and chairman of OneTen and former chief executive of Merck. "But we still have aspirations to make a big difference."
Many companies are rethinking their diversity efforts after the Supreme Court's ruling, and states including Florida and Texas passed laws to curtail D.E.I. policies. Lawsuits have been filed threatening businesses like a fund in Atlanta focused on backing Black female entrepreneurs.
Recent research suggests a pullback from practices such as requiring diverse candidate pools when interviewing to fill jobs. And the resignation of Claudine Gay, a Black woman, as president of Harvard has been celebrated by opponents of D.E.I. initiatives in academia and business who claimed she was a diversity hire.
Pfizer and two law firms, Morrison Foerster and Perkins Coie, opened their diversity fellowships last year to students of all races, after lawsuits against them alleged racial discrimination.
"There is diversity fatigue," said Debbie Dyson, chief executive of OneTen. "What we're doing can't be 'This is a diversity thing.' Skills give you an alternative path."
OneTen, whose founders include prominent Black business leaders like Mr. Frazier and Kenneth Chenault, former chief executive of American Express, promoted skills-based hiring from the start. More than 60 percent of all American workers do not have four-year college degrees, according to the Census Bureau. But requiring degrees in job postings hits minority applicants particularly hard, eliminating 72 percent of Black adults, for example.
Adopting skills-based practices, work force experts say, can help companies tap a broader pool of high-performing, dedicated workers, while increasing career opportunities and household incomes for millions of Americans. One study estimated that up to 30 million workers without four-year college degrees have most of the skills to succeed in better jobs paying 70 percent more.
OneTen began with a "superaggressive" goal and a diversity message, said Plinio Ayala, chief executive of Per Scholas, a nonprofit job-training program. The shift toward emphasizing skills, he said, "makes a lot more sense and is gaining traction."
OneTen's collaboration with Delta is a case study in the organization's revised approach.
Following the OneTen playbook, the airline has removed the four-year-degree requirement from 94 percent of its job listings, including for pilot roles. Previously, about half the jobs at Delta required a college degree.
The company initially heard internal criticism that OneTen was only for Black workers. But like OneTen itself, Delta moved to emphasize that skills-based hiring and promotion can benefit all workers.
"What has been very helpful is equity for all, and we're really leaning into that equity-for-all message," said Joanne Smith, chief people officer at Delta.
OneTen has also helped the airline create an apprenticeship program designed to move hourly workers into salaried positions with career tracks that typically pay wages of at least $ 60,000 a year.
The one-year apprenticeships involve classroom and on-the-job training, mentoring and support services. Graduates are guaranteed jobs. The program, which began as an experiment with six workers in 2021, had grown last year to a group of 56, who were selected from 7,000 applicants.
Sanassa Diane was part of that group. She started at Delta in 2018 in a call center. "When you called the 1-800 number, I was the person on the other end of the call," she said.
Ms. Diane, 28, rose up the call center hierarchy to become a customer support representative for an invitation-only service mainly for Delta's most lucrative frequent fliers, although she was still paid hourly.
A little over a year ago, Ms. Diane entered the apprenticeship program, gaining a salaried job in the corporate sales department arranging contracts and deals for Delta's business-customer accounts. Her pay rose more than 50 percent.
At first, the transition was daunting, she recalled, and she had "impostor syndrome," the sense of not belonging in a work setting. Delta arranged for an outside workplace coaching firm to help her manage the anxiety.
"Stepping into the corporate world can be challenging or scary, if you're not used to it," she said.
Ms. Diane, who dropped out of college, is taking courses toward a bachelor's degree in technology and management, and plans to work her way up the corporate ladder at Delta.
Despite Delta's embrace of skills-based hiring, the approach has yet to take off more broadly. In a OneTen survey last year of 500 hiring managers, 56 percent said removing four-year degree requirements would improve their hiring practices, but only 31 percent are doing it.
Those numbers point to the gap between recognizing an issue and altering corporate behavior, said Ginni Rometty, chairwoman of OneTen and former chief executive of IBM. "That requires culture change," she said. "And it does take time."
Having refined its approach, OneTen is making progress, but it's still far behind the million-jobs-in-a-decade pace embedded in its name. So far, the coalition of companies has elevated 108,000 people who meet the OneTen definition -- Black workers without four-year college degrees hired or promoted into jobs that pay family-sustaining wages, as measured by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's living-wage calculator.
In 30 percent of its allotted time, OneTen is about 10 percent of the way to its goal, even though its roster of member employers has nearly doubled to 65 companies.
Mr. Chenault, the former American Express chief, is now a managing director of General Catalyst, a venture capital firm. He compares OneTen to "a start-up that's in Year 3." It started with one focus, then saw a bigger opportunity and made a pivot.
"Yes, we're focused on African Americans, but there is this broader opportunity," he said. "If a company is going to skills-first practices, they are going to do it for everyone."
OneTen's expansion plans include working with community colleges as sources of talent and military bases as large civilian employers. But already, OneTen estimates that the income gains for the more than 100,000 Black workers its coalition partners have hired or promoted add up to $ 12 billion.
Demographic trends could also help persuade employers to change. America's working-age population is aging, shrinking and becoming more diverse. Millions of jobs are unfilled because of a lack of skilled workers.
"There is a fundamental business reason for companies to convert to a skills-based hiring system, beyond all the social justice themes that got us off the ground," said Mr. Frazier, the chairman of OneTen.

After Comedy, Embracing Notoriety: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Sofía Vergara invited the "Narcos" showrunner Eric Newman to her home in Los Angeles in 2015 to pitch a TV show about the Colombian drug lord Griselda Blanco, she'd done her research.
"I watched the 'Cocaine Cowboys' documentary in 2006, and I was like, 'Wow, this character has so many layers,"' Vergara, 51, said of Blanco, the kingpin who was suspected of being involved in more than 200 murders before being shot dead in her hometown, Medellín, in 2012 at age 69.
The facts of Blanco's life -- the murders, the kidnappings, the tense backroom meetings with drug bosses -- hardly needed embellishment for TV. But what had so hooked Vergara, she said, was the idea that "this innocuous-looking woman was raising four kids while building this insane, brutal empire."
She knew it would be a tougher sell to persuade people that after a little over half a decade portraying the feisty, fun-loving mother Gloria Delgado-Pritchett on the ABC sitcom "Modern Family," Vergara was the right person to play the cutthroat Blanco.
"I was like, 'What are the odds that this guy is going to think that Gloria Pritchett can play this [expletive] ruthless, crazy character?"' Vergara, who is Colombian, said in a recent phone conversation from London.
But her passion for the material, her biographical overlap with Blanco and her confidence convinced Newman -- and soon the Colombian director Andrés Baiz, who worked with Newman on Netflix's Medellín cartel series "Narcos" -- that she could pull it off.
Both, Baiz said, were driven, ambitious women who had immigrated to the U.S. from Colombia and ascended to the top of their industries. Both had grown up in a misogynist culture. Both, Baiz said, shared "an unstoppable, fierce quality."
"She knew so much about this woman," Baiz said from Bogotá in a recent video call, which Newman also joined from Santa Monica, Calif. "And she felt strongly that there was a part of her story that hadn't been explored onscreen before."
Of course, Blanco's rise and downfall as a boss in the fearsome drug trafficking syndicate founded by Pablo Escobar in 1976 had been dramatized before, most recently in the Lifetime movie "Cocaine Godmother" (2017), which starred Catherine Zeta-Jones, and in "Cocaine Cowboys" (2006). Although HBO announced in 2016 that it was developing a Blanco biopic that would star Jennifer Lopez, the project has yet to come to fruition.
Amid a landscape of South American narco tales that had been made mostly by white producers, Vergara had something different in mind. She envisioned a story told half in English and half in Spanish, with a majority-Latino cast, that put female characters front and center. Vergara would executive produce and star, with Baiz directing all six episodes. "Griselda" premieres Thursday on Netflix.
"It's hard for me to find characters because of my accent, and because I'm known for comedy," Vergara said. "So in a selfish way I was like, 'Oh, this is perfect for me."'
Rather than tracing Blanco's life story, as the other projects had done, "Griselda" focuses narrowly on the late 1970s and early '80s, starting with her arrival in Miami as the newly single mother of three sons. As she builds her empire, she is trailed by June Hawkins (Juliana Aidén Martinez), one of the first female homicide detectives in Miami, who worked to bring Blanco down.
"Her story offered a mirror to Griselda's story," Newman said of Hawkins. "Both were single mothers of Latin descent who found themselves rare women in similarly male-dominated fields."
Martinez, a Colombian American actress who was born in Miami, said that it was gratifying to be part of a project that centered the stories of its female characters, including Blanco's friend and confidante Carla, a sex worker who is played by the Colombian pop star Karol G, in her acting debut.
"The world understands the story of Griselda Blanco as something that is fiction, but we as Colombians see that story in a different way," Karol G said in a recent phone conversation from Los Angeles. "In every family there is a story about someone who passed away because of Pablo Escobar or Griselda Blanco."
Much of the Latino cast and creative team personally felt the difficulty of a nuanced depiction of Blanco, who had an outsize role in Colombia's sprawling drug trade and so had impacted their lives. Vergara said her older brother, Rafael, "was part of this business," when he was fatally shot in Bogotá in the 1990s, and her younger brother, Julio, battled drug addiction and was arrested nearly 30 times before being deported from the United States to Colombia in 2011.
"That era was horrible," she said. "What it did to generations -- their families, their kids -- was really heartbreaking."
Baiz, who said he saw numerous friends kidnapped after they were inadvertently caught up in the drug trade when he was growing up in the 1980s and '90s in Cali, Colombia, called the task of balancing Blanco's business acumen with the brutality of the drug trade the show's "dramatic challenge."
For Newman, it was important that "Griselda" resist the temptation to paint Blanco as a one-note villain.
"I don't believe in monsters," he said. "The danger of thinking that monsters spring forth from the womb is that you miss the ones created by their environments or circumstances."
At the heart of Blanco's story, Vergara said, was a tale of a mother trying to protect her children, by whatever means possible.
"I'm a mother, I'm an immigrant, I'm a woman," she said. "If something is happening and I have to kill someone for my son, I don't think I would think about it, I would just do it."
More difficult was the physical transformation Vergara underwent to portray Blanco, who stood just five feet tall and, with her cleft chin and cartoonish dimples, was hardly an intimidating physical presence. Vergara said she spent three hours in the makeup chair each day, donning a prosthetic nose, fake teeth and plastic "from my eyelids up to my forehead" to hide her thick eyebrows beneath her period-specific thin ones, as well as pads to flatten her bottom and bras that compressed her breasts.
"I didn't want people to see me and say 'Why does Gloria Pritchett think that by putting on a fake plastic nose, she's going to convince us that that's not her?"' she said.
Vergara also developed a swaggering stride for the character, trading her "sexy Caribbean walk" for a hunched masculine slouch she'd copied from one of her cousins.
"I thought it was great because it would help me with the character," she said. "But then after three months, it was 4 in the morning and I was trying to get out of bed to go to the set, and I couldn't do it -- my back gave out." (It was the only day of the three-month shoot, she noted, that she had to cancel filming.)
Many times she struggled to shake off her character after shooting wrapped for the day.
"Your body doesn't know that you're not going through those emotions during the day," Vergara said, explaining her character's range of experiences during a day on set. "I was doing coke, I was killing, they were choking me, I was screaming, I was crying, so when you go home, it's like, 'What is happening to me?"'
In her depiction, Vergara wanted to show Blanco's resilience as a survivor of domestic abuse with no education and few options, but also how those circumstances might have shaped her violent actions.
"You want to think that she's forced to do all these things because she needs to take care of her people," Vergara said. "But then little by little you realize, wait a minute, she had options to get away, to stop the madness. And then you understand that it was not a good intention that was making her do all of this that she did at the end."
Baiz said he hopes that, no matter what emotions people feel while watching the series -- empowerment, revulsion, horror, all of the above -- they will stick with it for all six episodes.
"If you end the show in Episode 2, it's a very different story that you're telling," he said. "We ended much later in her life story so we can see her humanity, but also her amoral and corrupt side."
Vergara hopes viewers come away not rooting for Griselda, but maybe understanding her.
"I always dreamed of Griselda to be a little bit like Tony Soprano," she said. "He was a very bad guy, but you wanted him to win; you could justify some of his behaviors."

Full text: As a personal assistant to a well-to-do retiree, Nora Szigeti is tasked with much of the usual fare: managing a calendar, booking travel, running errands. But after her 70-year-old boss recently came across an Instagram post shared by the account Class of Palm Beach, which documents outfits people have worn around that wealthy town, she took on another duty: publicist.
"My boss would be a perfect person for your site," Ms. Szigeti, 50, recalled writing in a message to the account in November. Soon after, her employer, Oblio Wish, appeared in a video shared by Class of Palm Beach, in which she showed off her wardrobe full of items from Dior, Gucci and Chanel.
She is one of the hundreds of Palm Beach residents and visitors -- whose ages have ranged from 20-something to 80-something -- who have been featured on Class of Palm Beach's Instagram, TikTok and Facebook accounts since they were started last March. Its accounts on those three platforms now have a combined audience of more than one million followers.
On the 14-mile-long island, Class of Palm Beach functions for some as a sort of social-media-age Shiny Sheet, a nickname for the Palm Beach Daily News, a paper that fills its pages with photographs from society galas and luncheons.
For others, like Ms. Szigeti, its accounts offer a near-daily glimpse into how the ultrarich dress. (A report from the U.S. Census Bureau listed the median household income in Palm Beach between 2018 and 2022 as $ 190,824.) Brunello Cucinelli, Zimmermann, and Hermès are names often uttered by people featured on the Class of Palm Beach accounts, many of whom can be seen clutching Chanel bags.
"For them, it's so ordinary: 'Oh, today I'm wearing a Rolex, and it's just a Birkin,"' Ms. Szigeti said of how casually some of the accounts' subjects can refer to watches and bags most people only dream of owning. "I have to save up two years to buy even half the Birkin."
Devorah Ezagui, 28, who lived in Palm Beach for part of her childhood, started the Class of Palm Beach accounts after moving back to the area last year. She had previously been living in New York, where she had been juggling personal training and marketing gigs, and where she would often ask people on the street about their outfits, she said.
The fashion in Palm Beach involves the same labels worn in other wealthy enclaves, but the way people wear them evokes a certain lifestyle, Ms. Ezagui said. The accounts, she added, were meant to showcase that lifestyle and offer an escape, as well as fashion inspiration.
Alanna Strei, a real estate agent in San Diego who discovered Class of Palm Beach on Instagram, said she appreciated its aesthetic of "old money glam" and its aspirational tone. Ms. Strei added that she also likes how the account features a breadth of people, not just "Real Housewives of Miami" types, as she put it.
Ms. Ezagui's videos for Class of Palm Beach are mostly man-on-the-street interviews in which she probes subjects about their clothes, accessories and fragrances while filming them on her iPhone. The approach is similar to that of other social media accounts that have started documenting outfits in well-heeled locations like Madison Avenue in New York and Greenwich, Conn.
Ms. Ezagui, whose wardrobe includes Celine flats and Maison Margiela denim shorts, is also a personal stylist to clients in the Palm Beach and New York areas. She said she spent at least four hours a day managing the Class of Palm Beach accounts, which have shared sponsored posts paid for by brands.
The accounts have also featured a few of the clients Ms. Ezagui has styled, she said, but most subjects are strangers she has encountered while out and about, whether shopping at a local Publix grocery store or at stores on Worth Avenue, a ritzy retail strip.
Though she has been to Mar-a-Lago, the residence of former President Donald J. Trump, she has yet to document any outfits there. "It was actually something I wanted to look into," she said. But there are "strict rules" about "going over to other people's tables" at the private club, she added.
The types of people she looks for have effervescent personalities and appear to have "really put intention into their outfit," she said. Ms. Ezagui added that about 70 percent of those she has asked to feature have agreed.
Most of those people are white women, a trend some followers of the accounts have pointed out in comments. Ms. Ezagui said the demographics of those featured was less reflective of her choices than it was of Palm Beach's population. A recent Census Bureau report found that about 94 percent of the town's residents were white and zero percent were Black.
"There's not everybody in this area," Ms. Ezagui said.
Some followers have also asked that she focus on a younger crowd. But Ms. Ezagui said that videos of older subjects reliably got more attention. "I know what will do well," she said.
On a rainy Saturday in January, as she was walking along Worth Avenue, Ms. Ezagui stopped to praise the outfit of a passerby, Carolina Paulino, who was wearing Zimmermann separates, Loro Piana shoes, an Hermès handbag and Cartier bracelets. Then came the question: Would she want to be filmed for a video?
Ms. Paulino, 28, who had come to have lunch in Palm Beach from Miami, agreed. She later said the outfit she was wearing was meant to evoke a "vibe of luxury, but beach."
Ms. Ezagui said that some people had asked her to feature fewer subjects in designer clothes and more in stylish items from affordable retailers like TJ Maxx. But to her, luxurious labels are a key element to Class of Palm Beach's success.
"People are trying to look for inspiration," she said.

Full text: An 1856 estate in Keswick, a six-bedroom compound on Nantucket and a Colonial Revival house in Hinsdale.
Keswick, Va. | $ 9.995 Million
An 1856 estate with five bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms, on a 286-acre lot
This house, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, has been updated by the sellers, who installed new appliances, a new electrical system and new plumbing during renovations, and also uncovered original floorboards and an original kitchen fireplace, which is now the centerpiece of a lower-level den.
The property is about a half-hour drive from the University of Virginia, in Charlottesville. Driving to Richmond or Fredericksburg takes just over an hour. Washington is two hours away.
Size: 7,586 square feet
Price per square foot: $ 1,318
Indoors: A long, gated driveway leads from the road up to the main house, where a paved path connects to the front entrance.
The front doors open into a foyer with high ceilings and original wood molding. To the right is a living room with a fireplace that has a simple white mantel and tall, deep-set windows overlooking the grounds. To the left is a dining room with another fireplace, more tall windows and a crystal chandelier.
The dining room connects to a bright kitchen outfitted with custom-made Officine Gullo components and a center island with a soapstone counter. A powder room is also in this part of the house.
The rear hall, accessible from the kitchen and the foyer, has a grand flying staircase that leads to the three bedrooms on the second floor.
The primary suite, to the right of the stair landing, has a fireplace and windows overlooking the grounds in the bedroom; the bathroom, which was once a guest room, has another fireplace, a shower with a glass door and a deep soaking tub. The other two bedrooms, across the hall, are each big enough to hold a queen-size bed and have en suite bathrooms.
The stairs continue to the top level, which holds a den, two more guest rooms and a full bathroom.
Another den and a pub with a built-in bar are on the lowest level of the house, where there was once a kitchen. A full bathroom, a laundry room and a mudroom are also on this level.
Outdoor space: The property includes several buildings, including a guest cottage with a kitchen, a classic red barn and a workshop that could be used as an art studio or events space. There is a pool within walking distance of the main house, along with a pool house in what was once the carriage house, with a bathroom and a laundry room. There is ample space for parking in the driveway, and plenty of room to add a garage.
Taxes: $ 34,128 (estimated)

This property, which includes a main house, a recently built guesthouse and a pool house, is about a mile from the Nantucket Historic District, putting it within an easy drive, bike ride or walk of the town's shops and restaurants, as well as Children's Beach, one of the island's most loved waterfront spots. A Stop & Shop grocery store and Cisco Brewers, a popular distillery, are also nearby.
In the summer, high-speed ferries make the trip to Hyannis, on Cape Cod, in about an hour, while regular ferries take about two hours to reach the mainland.
Size: 4,045 square feet
Price per square foot: $ 2,471
Indoors: The main house is set back from the street, with the entrance at the end of a covered porch.
The front door opens into a foyer with hardwood floors and access to a powder room. Beyond is an open living area with a sleek gas fireplace framed by white shiplap; a dining area; and access to the side porch and a den used as a media room.
The adjacent kitchen has stainless steel appliances; a tiered island with space for several bar stools; a window over the sink looking out onto the swimming pool; and stairs to the lower level. A bedroom with an en suite bathroom that has a walk-in shower is off the kitchen.
The second level, reached from a staircase near the foyer, is configured as one large primary suite, with sloped ceilings, built-in cabinetry, a dressing area with several large closets, and a full bathroom.
Two more bedrooms and two full bathrooms are on the lowest level of the main house, along with a laundry room and a living room with French doors that open to a sunken brick patio.
Across the pool from the main house is a guesthouse with two bedrooms and two full bathrooms, along with a living room and a kitchen.

A 1913 Colonial Revival house with eight bedrooms, seven full bathrooms and two half bathrooms, on a 2.8-acre lot
Designated House Beautiful magazine's Whole Home of 2023, this house was decorated by 15 design firms led by female designers who collaborated with J. Jordan Homes, a builder, to create a showplace of décor. Materials used include English pine paneling, custom paint and wallpaper, and, in one room, a repurposed 18th-century chimney piece.
The property is half a mile from Brook Park, which has an open green space and pickleball courts, and about a five-minute drive from shops, restaurants and the train station at the center of the village. Driving to Chicago takes about half an hour.
Size: 13,879 square feet
Price per square foot: $ 721
Indoors: A brick driveway leads from the street to the portico-covered entrance at the front of the house.

Beyond the living room is a sunroom with French doors that open to a terrace overlooking a swimming pool.
To the left of the foyer is a hallway with black-and-white tile floors leading to the kitchen, which has Monogram stainless steel appliances, built-in cookbook shelves and access to the rear staircase and to a breakfast room with a long marble bar. A guest suite with a bedroom, a pink-and-green sitting room and a full bathroom papered in a pink-and-green toile print is also in this part of the house.

Another bedroom and full bathroom are on the lowest level of the house, along with a party room that has orange walls, built-in banquette seating and a bowling alley.
Outdoor space: The house is surrounded by manicured gardens with mature trees, low hedges and fountains. The in-ground swimming pool is surrounded by a stone deck. The attached garage holds three cars.

Outsider vs. Insider: Does It Matter?: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Looking Back," the nonprofit gallery's group show, brings together self-taught and highly trained artists. It isn't obvious who's who.
It's pleasantly disorienting to enter the White Columns Annual in New York in 2024 and see so much work that could have been, and was, made any time in the last half century. There's not a screen, QR code or 3-D print in sight. But since its inauguration in 2006, the nonprofit gallery's "Looking Back" series has made an old-school proposition: to curate a group show around one person's (or collective's) taste, shorn of commercial or institutional impulses to either move product or capture a zeitgeist.
The Annual has one constraint. The curator must have seen the included work in New York City in the previous year. In this grass-roots way, the show offers a (very subjective, and therefore narrow) group portrait of an increasingly unwieldy scene. Those who see a lot of art might recognize a few pieces. But not everything.
The curator tapped for the 14th edition is Randy Kennedy, the director of special projects for the international art gallery Hauser & Wirth, and a former staff reporter at The New York Times who occasionally contributes to the obituaries desk. The pieces he picked here, by 35 artists, tend toward so-called outsider art, particularly abstract painting and assemblage that appears more felt than thought.
There are outsider staples, like two seductively muted paintings on board from the 1980s by the prolific Alabaman folk artist Mose Tolliver; and contemporary discoveries, particularly the self-taught Moroccan-American sculptor Manal Kara, whose "Unidentified Mathematical Objects (lottery picker 2)," a random-number generator made from a fur-lined fruit crate, screwdriver handles and multisided dice, debuted at Deli Gallery in TriBeCa in 2023. Its deft scrappy aesthetic, applied to a modern symptom like the Powerball, winks at the stereotype of the outsider artist as visionary naïf.
Sharing space with diamonds-in-the-rough are accomplished figures known for rough-hewed work, such as an undated wall-mounted junk assemblage by Noah Purifoy and one of Beverly Buchanan's chunky scrap wood maquettes of her shacklike studio.
Kennedy's Annual muddies the already murky boundary between inside and outside. Whatever superficial cues might distinguish one from the other don't hold here. They shouldn't elsewhere, either -- curators and critics have worked against this hierarchy for decades. These approachable works are an encouraging sign of a leveling playing field for artists, who may or may not have lived in a big city, gone to art school, had a gallery, or shared their art with a soul.
Yet the ongoing interest in deskilled, intuitive artmaking also speaks to the present sense of stagnation, even conservatism, as anxious artists and dealers retread safe ground, no matter how "meta" they're being. When the world feels chaotic, culture takes an inward turn.
Kennedy made several selections from last year's Outsider Art Fair, including the jaunty, arrowlike rows of "White and Yellow Carrots," by the self-taught artist Evelyn Reyes, who worked in a studio for adults with disabilities until 2017. A composition by an unknown painter named Richard E. Treubel titled "Egg in Reverse," from around 1965 -- squidges of golden impasto in a sea of yolk-yellow, cradling a white blob -- cuts its cosmic symbolism with a gonzo sense of humor.
One wall features several swirling mandalas pristinely plotted with a rainbow of ballpoint pens. They could be dazzling examples of process-based conceptual drawings from the 1970s -- but in fact were the retirement pastime of Harold Granucci, an accountant and furniture salesman, circa 1992. If the outsider can be meticulous, the insider can let loose: a gloopy white sculpture based on a ready Kleenex is the latest from Jennifer Bolande, a postmodern artist known for crisp and heady photographs and installations.
Some artists revel in the art world's margins. "Smoker Choice," a strip of wooden siding painted with bands of red, white and tan, resembles a glowing cigarette. It's a playful 2023 piece by Tyree Guyton, the artist behind the Heidelberg Project in Detroit, a junkyard fantasia of weathered toys, scrap metal and household discards assembled in a string of once-vacant lots. Guyton started Heidelberg in 1986, and gradually gained acceptance -- first from his neighbors, then from the art world. This work, which appeared at Martos Gallery in New York last year, would be funny anywhere, but in the context of a proper gallery in Manhattan shows Guyton gleefully mixing highbrow and lowbrow aesthetics, hard-edge abstraction from the Neo-Geo movement, with the beret-and-palette caricature of the chain-smoking artist, all through his signature urban materials.
Another demi-outsider, Sarah Rapson, attended the Whitney Independent Study Program in 1989, then worked for the blue-chip artist Richard Prince. About 20 years ago -- like Purifoy relocating to Joshua Tree, Calif.; or Buchanan to Macon, Ga. -- she moved to coastal England and abandoned the mainstream. But she kept tabs on it. Her collages made from what look like old gallery advertisements, wrapped around the ends of long sticks, are among the first works in the show, setting the scene for artists with a foot in both worlds.
A few pieces feel like the curator's inside jokes. A sequined tapestry by Larry Krone, Kennedy's brother-in-law, shares a wall with a pulsing, flame-colored abstraction drawn by Rhoda Kellogg, an early-childhood educator, from Kennedy's own collection. And one incongruous assemblage, a wooden cane fitted with a rifle scope hung above a postcard of the city hall in Cisco, Texas, is by the artist Will Boone -- which makes sense if you know that Kennedy and Boone, who are both from Texas, are writing a play about a dramatic 1927 bank robbery in that same town. It was an outside job.

'Devil's Breath' Blamed As Visitors to Colombia Are Drugged on Dates: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Steven Valdez thought he recognized the woman in the Medellín park. Chatting, the two realized they had matched on the dating platform Tinder. They exchanged numbers and made plans.
On their date last spring, he said the woman suggested that he try a typical Colombian dish -- a creamy soup called ajiaco. She carried it from a restaurant counter to their table.
He had two spoonfuls, Mr. Valdez, 31, said. "And that's the last thing I remember."
Like scores of visitors to the Colombian city last year, Mr. Valdez, a travel blogger, said he was told at the hospital that he had ingested a powerful, potentially fatal cocktail of sedatives, including a drug called scopolamine.
Scopolamine makes its victims black out, and experts say it can also make them unusually open to suggestion -- including agreeing to hand over a wallet or reveal passwords.
American officials are so concerned that they issued a security alert this month about the sedatives and a wave of violent crime targeting visitors to Colombia, especially in the increasingly popular tourist destination of Medellín, a city of 2.6 million in a valley of the Andes Mountains.
The U.S. Embassy, in a previous security alert, describes scopolamine as an "odorless, tasteless, memory-blocking substance used to incapacitate and rob unwary victims" and warns of using dating applications in Colombia or visiting nightclubs and bars.
Colombian officials say many of the incidents involve the city's sex industry.
"Unfortunately, due to word of mouth, people are identifying that in Medellín there are pretty girls and you can party really hard at a very low cost," said Carlos Calle, who monitors the tourism industry for the city government. "Criminals are taking advantage of that."
Since the pandemic, Medellín has also drawn thousands of digital nomads seeking cultural immersion and a cheap Airbnb, and investigators and lawyers say that they, too, are being targeted on mainstream dating platforms like Tinder.
Tinder did not respond to a request for comment.
While deaths are relatively rare, authorities in Medellín said the number of robberies involving scopolamine and other sedatives has risen sharply in recent years, though the exact number is unknown, since many victims do not go to the police.
"There are people who feel too embarrassed because if they file a report, people will know what they were doing," said Manuel Villa Mejía, the city's security secretary.
Jorge Wilson Vélez, a forensic criminologist who works with victims and their families, said there were likely hundreds of victims last year.
Perpetrators see the robberies as a tax on tourists whom they view as wealthy and in Colombia to prey on women, Mr. Vélez said. The intent is not to kill anybody, he added. "They call it, 'giving the guys something to sleep."'
Last year, Medellín saw 1.4 million foreign visitors, nearly 40 percent of whom were American, according to city data.
Crimes against American visitors have stirred fears in the expat community. An English-language Facebook group, Colombia Scopolamine Victims & Alerts, has about 3,800 members.
Americans are being hit, Mr. Vélez said, because they're going online "looking for company, a relationship," and especially when they go on dates alone.
Scopolamine, also known as "devil's breath," has been reported elsewhere in Latin America and beyond, with cases popping up from London to Bangkok.
But the drug's rise in Colombia, and the embassy's warning to Americans, comes as a particular blow to a country trying hard to change its image.
Medellín, in particular, has struggled to shed associations with drugs, violence and Pablo Escobar. The city has undergone a major transformation since the 1990s, boasting sleek museums, cafes on tree-lined streets, and the country's only metro system. While some criminal gangs remain, the city's homicide rates have plunged.
Crimes targeting tourists may tarnish that rosy picture -- but so, too, do the tourists themselves, according to officials and lawyers who represent men targeted by thieves, who say some are treating Medellín like a lurid playground.
"There's this weird mystique. You come to Medellín, and the normal rules don't apply," said Alan Gongora, an American lawyer in Medellín. "Like, anything is possible."
Some crime victims said they were just looking for a date.
During the pandemic, Mr. Valdez left Los Angeles, where he worked in television production, to travel and work on his blogs, including one called We Like Colombia. He was in Medellín last May, working and taking bachata lessons, he said, when he opened Tinder to find a dance partner.
After his date with a woman who called herself Luisa, he said he woke up in his Airbnb, alone and unable to stand up. His right leg felt broken.
The police later told him his captors had beat him, likely because he had resisted being robbed, Mr. Valdez said. Hospital blood tests revealed the presence of scopolamine and another drug, clonazepam, a depressant.
He lost his phones, laptop, wallet and about $ 7,000, he said.
But he felt lucky to be alive.
Mr. Valdez reported the attack, and his date and several others were arrested after trying to use his bank cards to purchase appliances at a store, according to the police.
He tries to keep what happened in perspective. "I've been to Colombia, like, eight times now since the pandemic," said Mr. Valdez, who now lives in Puerto Rico. "I've seen organized crime is rampant because prices are going so high over there. You know, the regular citizens can't afford it."
Criminal groups that lure victims through dating platforms are typically small, unaffiliated crews from poor neighborhoods, investigators in Medellín said.
One 42-year-old man from New York recalled being drugged by a Tinder date who served him a rum and coke that he said knocked him out for 24 hours.
She stole his electronic devices, silver jewelry, a bank card and cash. "I thought I had lost everything," said the man, who asked to go by his initials, R.J., to protect future job prospects. But his passport and IDs were right where he had hidden them. A police report viewed by The Times corroborated details of the crime.
Leaving a passport, investigators said, is a signature of these crimes -- meant to encourage victims to leave without reporting the robbery or pressing charges.
Some thieves can be sophisticated.
In December, a young German scientist touring Latin America and posting videos under the name Dr. Travel said he was robbed in Medellín by a woman he was "chatting with" after joining her and her friend for a meal.
He drank a pink soda, he said in a video, and later awoke to find his wallet and phone gone. His phone's tracking function was deactivated, his Apple ID password changed and his bank account drained. Holdings in several cryptocurrency exchanges were sold, the funds moved to other crypto wallets.
He lost more than $ 16,000, he said. Attempts to reach the man were unsuccessful.
Scopolamine has long been used to treat motion sickness and nausea, but became popular in larger doses around three decades ago as a recreational drug and to commit crimes, said Guillermo Castaño, a senior investigator for Colombia's science ministry.
Around 10 years ago, criminals in Colombia started using it to target tourists, Dr. Castaño said, often mixing it with benzodiazepines, depressants that typically treat insomnia and anxiety, to further incapacitate victims.
In a widely publicized case, Paul Nguyen, a 27-year-old from California, was fatally drugged by a Tinder date in Medellín in late 2022, his body found near a dumpster. An autopsy determined he had been drugged with clonazepam, which, combined with alcohol, had caused his death.
His date and several accomplices were arrested and are now on trial, tracked down with the help of a photo of the woman that Mr. Nguyen posted on Snapchat before he disappeared.
Medellín authorities have said stopping the attacks is a top priority. Four people were recently arrested in connection with the murder of another American tourist who may have met a date online.
Still, arrests are rare.
Mr. Nguyen's mother, Kimberly Dao, said the family had to hire Mr. Vélez, the investigator, to push the police to pursue the case.
For Ms. Dao, the U.S. Embassy alert about online dating in Colombia is a sign the issue is being taken seriously -- though she wished it had come sooner.
If it had, she said, "I would beg him, I would not let him go."

A Hazard for Visitors to Colombia: ‘Devil’s Breath’

BOGOTÁ, Colombia — Steven Valdez thought he recognized the woman in the Medellín park. Chatting, the two realized they had matched on the dating platform Tinder. They exchanged numbers and made plans.
On their date last spring, he said the woman suggested that he try a typical Colombian dish — a creamy soup called ajiaco. She carried it from a restaurant counter to their table.
He had two spoonfuls, Valdez, 31, said. “And that’s the last thing I remember.”
Like scores of visitors to the Colombian city last year, Valdez, a travel blogger, said he was told at the hospital that he had ingested a powerful, potentially fatal cocktail of sedatives, including a drug called scopolamine.
Scopolamine makes its victims black out, and experts say it can also make them unusually open to suggestion — including agreeing to hand over a wallet or reveal passwords.
American officials are so concerned that they issued a security alert this month about the sedatives and a wave of violent crime targeting visitors to Colombia, especially in the increasingly popular tourist destination of Medellín, a city of 2.6 million in a valley of the Andes Mountains.
The U.S. Embassy, in a previous security alert, describes scopolamine as an “odorless, tasteless, memory-blocking substance used to incapacitate and rob unwary victims” and warns of using dating applications in Colombia or visiting nightclubs and bars.
Colombian officials say many of the incidents involve the city’s sex industry.
“Unfortunately, due to word-of-mouth, people are identifying that in Medellín, there are pretty girls, and you can party really hard at a very low cost,” said Carlos Calle, who monitors the tourism industry for the city government. “Criminals are taking advantage of that.”
Since the pandemic, Medellín has also drawn thousands of digital nomads seeking cultural immersion and a cheap Airbnb, and investigators and lawyers say that they, too, are being targeted on mainstream dating platforms like Tinder.
Tinder did not respond to a request for comment.
While deaths are relatively rare, authorities in Medellín said the number of robberies involving scopolamine and other sedatives has risen sharply in recent years, though the exact number is unknown, since many victims do not go to the police.
“There are people who feel too embarrassed because if they file a report, people will know what they were doing,” said Manuel Villa Mejía, the city’s security secretary.
Jorge Wilson Vélez, a forensic criminologist who works with victims and their families, said there were likely hundreds of victims last year.
Perpetrators see the robberies as a tax on tourists whom they view as wealthy and in Colombia to prey on women, Vélez said. The intent is not to kill anybody, he added, saying, “They call it ‘giving the guys something to sleep.’”
Last year, Medellín saw 1.4 million foreign visitors, nearly 40% of whom were American, according to city data.
Crimes against American visitors have stirred fears in the expat community. An English-language Facebook group, Colombia Scopolamine Victims & Alerts, has about 3,800 members.
Americans are being hit, Vélez said, because they’re going online “looking for company, a relationship,” and especially when they go on dates alone.
Scopolamine, also known as “devil’s breath,” has been reported elsewhere in Latin America and beyond, with cases popping up from London to Bangkok.
But the drug’s rise in Colombia and the embassy’s warning to Americans come as a particular blow to a country trying hard to change its image.
Medellín, in particular, has struggled to shed associations with drugs, violence and Pablo Escobar. The city has undergone a major transformation since the 1990s, boasting sleek museums, cafes on tree-lined streets, and the country’s only metro system. While some criminal gangs remain, the city’s homicide rates have plunged.
Crimes targeting tourists may tarnish that rosy picture — but so, too, do the tourists themselves, according to officials and lawyers who represent men targeted by thieves, who say some are treating Medellín like a lurid playground.
“There’s this weird mystique. You come to Medellín, and the normal rules don’t apply,” said Alan Gongora, an American lawyer in Medellín. “Like, anything is possible.”
Some crime victims said they were just looking for a date.
During the pandemic, Valdez left Los Angeles, where he worked in television production, to travel and work on his blogs, including one called We Like Colombia. He was in Medellín last May, working and taking bachata lessons, he said, when he opened Tinder to find a dance partner.
After his date with a woman who called herself Luisa, he said he woke up in his Airbnb, alone and unable to stand up. His right leg felt broken.
Police later told him his captors had beaten him, likely because he had resisted being robbed, Valdez said. Hospital blood tests revealed the presence of scopolamine and another drug, clonazepam, a depressant.
He lost his phones, laptop, wallet and about $7,000, he said.
But he felt lucky to be alive.
Valdez reported the attack, and his date and several others were arrested after trying to use his bank cards to purchase appliances at a store, according to the police.
He tries to keep what happened in perspective. “I’ve been to Colombia, like, eight times now since the pandemic,” said Valdez, who now lives in Puerto Rico. “I’ve seen organized crime is rampant because prices are going so high over there. You know, the regular citizens can’t afford it.”
Criminal groups that lure victims through dating platforms are typically small, unaffiliated crews from poor neighborhoods, investigators in Medellín said.
One 42-year-old man from New York recalled being drugged by a Tinder date who served him a rum and coke that he said knocked him out for 24 hours.
She stole his electronic devices, silver jewelry, a bank card and cash. “I thought I had lost everything,” said the man, who asked to go by his initials, R.J., to protect future job prospects. But his passport and IDs were right where he had hidden them. A police report viewed by The New York Times corroborated details of the crime.
Leaving a passport, investigators said, is a signature of these crimes — meant to encourage victims to leave without reporting the robbery or pressing charges.
Some thieves can be sophisticated.
In December, a young German scientist touring Latin America and posting videos under the name Dr. Travel said he was robbed in Medellín by a woman he was “chatting with” after joining her and her friend for a meal.
He drank a pink soda, he said in a video, and later awoke to find his wallet and phone gone. His phone’s tracking function was deactivated, his Apple ID password changed and his bank account drained. Holdings in several cryptocurrency exchanges were sold, the funds moved to other crypto wallets.
He lost more than $16,000, he said. Attempts to reach the man were unsuccessful.
Scopolamine has long been used to treat motion sickness and nausea, but it became popular in larger doses around three decades ago as a recreational drug and to commit crimes, said Guillermo Castaño, a senior investigator for Colombia’s science ministry.
Around 10 years ago, criminals in Colombia started using it to target tourists, Castaño said, often mixing it with benzodiazepines, depressants that typically treat insomnia and anxiety, to further incapacitate victims.

How Hawaii's Coffee Farmers Fight Counterfeit Kona Beans: [National Desk]

Full text: A testing method borrowed from geology helped farmers sue a slew of stores selling supposed "Kona" coffee.
On the volcanic slopes of Hawaii's Big Island, hundreds of farmers in the Kona region produce one of the most expensive coffees in the world.
Those farmers recently won a series of settlements -- totaling more than $ 41 million -- after a nearly five-year legal battle with distributors and retailers that were accused of using the Kona name in a misleading way.
The class-action lawsuit, aided by a novel chemical analysis of coffee from Hawaii and around the world, prompted some companies to include the percentage of authentic Kona beans on product labels. The plaintiffs said they hoped the hefty settlements -- the last of which will likely be paid this spring -- would deter others from selling fake Kona.
"There are probably many, many more marketers of coffee who have misused geographic names in marketing, and this will be a disincentive," said Bruce Corker, who owns the Rancho Aloha coffee farm in the Kona district.
Mr. Corker practiced law in Seattle until 2001, when he and his wife moved to Hawaii. He had learned to grow coffee three decades earlier while in the Peace Corps in Colombia.
Kona coffee, known for its mellow and sweet notes, thrives in the mineral-rich soil. The plants receive lots of rain, and the land's incline provides excellent drainage. Red cherries are picked by hand and "pulped" to separate the seeds, which are dried in the sun. Milling then produces green coffee beans for roasting.
The Kona belt includes some 600 to 1,000 farms, typically smaller than five acres. The limited supply, labor costs and unpredictable pest problems put a high price on the beans, around $ 50 a pound or more.
Mr. Corker said farmers had long been frustrated by the ubiquitous "Kona" beans sold by souvenir stores, coffee shops and larger retailers. They strongly suspected that the products were fake: They were far too cheap.
In 2013, a U.S. Supreme Court case caught Mr. Corker's attention. The court found that Pom Wonderful, which sells pomegranate juice, was allowed to sue Coca-Cola for marketing a "Pomegranate Blueberry" juice that was in fact more than 99 percent apple and grape juices.
"The decision said, if you're harmed by false labeling, you can bring a case for damages," Mr. Corker said.
In 2019, he filed the lawsuit on behalf of Kona farmers against more than 20 companies. At the center of the complaint was a chemical analysis performed at a private lab in Salt Lake City.
James Ehleringer, a biologist at the University of Utah who ran the analysis, said that standard tests depended on the amount of water in each sample. That wouldn't have worked on the variety of Kona products at issue.
"As you go from green beans to roasted beans, you're changing the water content," he said. So he borrowed an approach from geology that instead looked at the relative concentrations of rare, inorganic minerals in the beans. These ratios, he said, stay constant even at roasting temperatures.
After testing coffee samples from around the world as well as more than 150 samples from Kona farms, Dr. Ehleringer's team identified several element ratios -- strontium to zinc, for example, and barium to nickel -- that distinguished Kona from non-Kona samples. "We were able to establish a fingerprint for Kona," said Dr. Ehleringer, who described the general method in a 2020 study. "It's the characteristics of the volcanic rock."
Those chemical signatures, he found, were largely absent from samples of coffee labeled "Kona" sold by the defendants.
Dr. Ehleringer said that the method was easy and cheap -- about $ 50 per sample. Other researchers have used a similar approach to test honey, oils, onions and wine.
Some defendants contested the testing in a legal motion, arguing that Dr. Ehleringer's data had not been replicated by other labs. (The case was settled before a ruling was made on the motion.)
Proving a legal claim of false advertising boils down to more than the product's geographic origin, noted Rebecca Tushnet, a professor at Harvard who specializes in advertising law and has written about this case.
French fries, for example, don't have to be made in France, and Swiss cheese doesn't have to come from Switzerland. "The question is, what does Kona mean?" Ms. Tushnet said. "The plaintiffs say Kona means it's grown in that region. If that's what consumers believe, then that's what they're entitled to get."
The case was settled before the court could answer that question. The largest settlement, $ 12 million, came from MNS, a company that operates a chain mostly in Hawaii called ABC Stores. Another Hawaiian outfit, Mulvadi, which sells coffee to outlets including ABC, Amazon and Walmart, offered the farmers $ 7.775 million. Neither company admitted wrongdoing. (The lawyer representing MNS declined to comment. Counsel for Mulvadi and several other defendants did not respond to requests for comment.)
Dexter Washburn, a retired Kona farmer and former lawyer who helped Mr. Corker bring the lawsuit, said that the best way to find real Kona is to buy directly from a farmer, whether in person or online. "I don't trust anything you buy in the store," he said.

Milan Chatters About a Social Media Star's Stumble: [Style Desk]

Full text: Embroiled in a scandal, the social media queen faces criminal charges, sponsor defection and a loss of faith among her 29 million Instagram followers.
What becomes of a famous influencer when followers suddenly drop her by the hundreds of thousands, sponsors start running for the exits and the reputation underpinning all that influence is suddenly derailed?
That question was on a lot of minds during men's fashion week in Milan, where even excited chatter about a surprise front-row appearance by Jeff Bezos and his fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, at the Dolce & Gabbana show was quickly overtaken by whispered updates on the weird case of Chiara Ferragni.
As many are aware, Ms. Ferragni is a digital entrepreneur with her own production agency, her own Prime Video series, 29 million Instagram followers and more problems at the moment than the best glow-up can conceal.
By far Italy's most glamorous and celebrated influencer, Ms. Ferragni, 36, pioneered the business of self-branding and paid posts in Milan, starting as a fashion blogger before shifting her storytelling from documenting designer get-ups and handbags and her tastes in nail art, makeup palettes and drip coffee to tracking every dimension of her personal life.
Following her marriage to the Italian rapper Federico Leonardo Lucia -- stage name Fedez -- in 2018, she went on to showcase her daily existence minutely across social media. Using a variety of formats and platforms, Ms. Ferragni posted details of her idyllic wedding and subsequent relationship bobbles, including sessions in couples therapy. When she became pregnant, she posted prenatal ultrasounds of her children, Vittoria and Leone, and would later track their growth spurts and elf costumes in so much detail it attracted the attention of child welfare advocates.
She deployed social media to track her husband's cancer treatment and family ski holidays in the Alps, and she routinely beckoned followers into the closet of a multimillion-dollar penthouse she owns in the luxury CityLife complex in central Milan as well as a retreat they recently constructed near George Clooney's villa on the shores of Lake Como.
Then, abruptly, in the weeks before Christmas, Ms. Ferragni went dark. The reasons became clear when accusations resurfaced of a charitable giving scam involving her and first reported on in December 2022.
"Italian social media star faces sticky questions over charity cake fraud," The Financial Times wrote of an investigation by the Milan prosecutor's office into the sale of a pink-boxed Christmas cake, or pandoro, produced that year by the venerable Balocco bakery conglomerate and branded with Ms. Ferragni's name. Consumers flocked to buy the traditional cake despite its $ 10 price tag -- more than two and a half times the cost of a normal pandoro -- lured by the Ferragni association but also the influencer's implication on social media posts that money from the sales would be directed toward buying equipment for a children's cancer hospital.
As it happened, the cause the influencer had earmarked for charity was herself. (The Balocco bakery donated money to the hospital months before the cakes were ever put on sale.) "In reality, Chiara Ferragni earned a million euros for putting her name on the pandoro," Selvaggia Lucarelli, a journalist who first reported the story in the newspaper Domani, wrote in an email. But in 2022 "the story had limited media resonance," she said, "because Chiara Ferragni was powerful and untouchable."
But that was before an Italian consumer group brought a class-action suit against her, and local officials initiated a criminal investigation charging her with aggravated fraud. Ms. Ferragni, while appealing the class-action fine, would ultimately donate a substantial sum to a women's rights association to fund anti-violence centers and would claim that pandoro-gate was the result of a "communication error." Despite these gestures of contrition, she found herself abandoned by major sponsors like Coca-Cola, the eyewear giant Safilo and then by followers in the hundreds of thousands.
When, at last, Ms. Ferragni resurfaced on Instagram, it was to post a distinctly unglamorous mea culpa reel. In it, the social media star appeared starkly deglamorized, wearing scant makeup and dressed in a drab gray shirt resembling prison garb, to issue a public apology and to announce a genuine personal donation, this one a million euros to the Regina Margherita Hospital in Turin, Italy.
Even at that, it took no time for critics to seize on her misjudged optics, noting that the shirt she was wearing sells for 600 euros and is cashmere, and for memes to proliferate poking fun at her wardrobe choices, her no longer exalted status as one half of a glamour couple known as "Ferragnez" and even the family dog.
"Unfortunately, she must have bad people around her and made all the wrong choices," said Raffaello Napoleone, the chief executive of Pitti Immagine, the Italian fashion and design trade group, before the Neil Barrett men's wear show on Saturday. "When you make an apology, you have to appear as you really are. She appeared as a nun, and she is not a nun."
It was no help to Ms. Ferragni's cause that Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, took to attacking her in fiery public speeches as an affront to decency, honesty and the very core of "Italianity," or Italianness. And in that, some saw not only political opportunism (Fedez has been a vocal critic of the right-wing leader), but also "more than a whiff of misogyny," as one fashion critic noted at the Dsquared show, speaking anonymously in adherence with her publication's employment guidelines.
"Yes, she overstepped, as maybe all the influencers overstep by becoming gurus," the critic added. "But the woman-on-woman attack feeds into a prevailing anti-feminist rhetoric."
Whether that is so, there is no doubting the pass-along effects Ms. Ferragni's missteps have had on what Rupert Younger, the director of the Center for Corporate Reputation at the University of Oxford, termed in The Financial Times as "reputational risk."
Consider that, despite deep seasonal discounts posted on the shiny branded goods that fill the racks and windows of the slick Ferragni store near Corso Como this busy past weekend, there was barely a shopper to be seen. No one around was spotted toting one of Chiara Ferragni's signature bags with their logo of an oversize eye.
The scene was similar at the Ferragni outpost in Rome, according to a report in La Repubblica. Gawkers stopped to gape at the windows. Then they walked right past.
"The criminal charges are not the most important part of the story," Ms. Lucarelli, the journalist, said. "They might lead to nothing." What is important to watch, she said, is what happens after a powerful influencer's reputation falters and with it the "adoration of her followers, who felt betrayed."
What, in other words, is left to sell once you've sold out?

Conservative Magnate Backs Case With Potential to Disrupt Regulation: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The case, to be argued by lawyers linked to the petrochemicals billionaire Charles Koch, could sharply curtail the government's regulatory authority.
The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on Wednesday that, on paper, are about a group of commercial fishermen who oppose a government fee that they consider unreasonable. But the lawyers who have helped to propel their case to the nation's highest court have a far more powerful backer: the petrochemicals billionaire Charles Koch.
The case is one of the most consequential to come before the justices in years. A victory for the fishermen would do far more than push aside the monitoring fee, part of a system meant to prevent overfishing, that they objected to. It would very likely sharply limit the power of many federal agencies to regulate not only fisheries and the environment, but also health care, finance, telecommunications and other activities, legal experts say.
"It might all sound very innocuous," said Jody Freeman, founder and director of the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program and a former Obama White House official. "But it's connected to a much larger agenda, which is essentially to disable and dismantle federal regulation."
The lawyers who represent the New Jersey-based fishermen are working pro bono and belong to a public-interest law firm, Cause of Action, that discloses no donors and reports having no employees. However, court records show that the lawyers work for Americans for Prosperity, a group funded by Mr. Koch, the chairman of Koch Industries and a champion of anti-regulatory causes.
The law firm's board of directors includes a top lawyer at the firm that has represented Koch Industries in a range of cases, like the company's past defense against lawsuits linked to its handling of petroleum coke, a byproduct of oil refining, and in its opposition to stronger regulations on the substance.
The lawyer also represents Koch Industries in an ongoing lawsuit filed by the Minnesota attorney general that accuses the company of deceptive practices related to climate change.
Other members of the board include executives at groups predominantly funded by Mr. Koch or by Koch Industries, America's second-largest privately held company, after Cargill.
Ryan Mulvey, counsel for Cause of Action and one of the lawyers litigating the case before the Supreme Court, said the focus "should be on the fishermen and what they are fighting."
"This case is about the livelihoods of hard-working, family-run fishing companies that are under threat because of unconstitutional overreach by the government," Mr. Mulvey said.
A spokeswoman at Cause of Action said the group was within its constitutional rights to not disclose its donors. The spokeswoman, who declined to be identified, said that Cause of Action and Americans for Prosperity were separate organizations. Neither Mr. Koch nor Koch Industries was involved in the case, she said. Koch Industries did not respond to requests for comment.
Rolling back the power of the state to regulate business has been a longstanding goal of conservative legal activists and their funders, who have been engaged in a yearslong effort to use the judicial system to rewrite environmental law. In 2022, they scored a victory with a Supreme Court decision that could sharply limit the federal government's authority to reduce carbon dioxide from power plants. Emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are a primary cause of climate change.
The legal doctrine being challenged in the fishing case, Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, No. 22-452, has wider implications. The doctrine, known as Chevron deference, after a 1984 Supreme Court ruling involving the oil and gas giant, empowers federal agencies to interpret ambiguities in laws passed by Congress.
Congress is not equipped to manage the day-to-day administration of the legislation it passes, the reasoning goes, so it should rely on federal agencies to carry out laws and policies. Weakening or eliminating the doctrine of Chevron deference could limit the power of federal agencies to interpret the laws they administer.
The Biden administration has defended the rule, arguing that executive agencies, unlike courts, are politically accountable.
Supporters of the rule say the case is a vehicle for other interests beyond the fishermen's complaint.
"These fisheries workers are providing cover for what is ultimately a Koch campaign," said Lisa Graves, executive director of the progressive watchdog group True North Research and a former senior Justice Department official.
With the Supreme Court's shift to the right in recent years, free-market proponents appear to see an opportunity to clip the wings of federal power, in part by bringing carefully selected cases before sympathetic judges.
That shift has been aided by groups, including those linked to Mr. Koch, that worked to support the nomination and confirmation of the five most recent Republican appointees on the bench.
At a forum hosted in November by the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group, a lawyer laid out the strategy.
"To successfully wage such a campaign, you need three things," Damien M. Schiff, a senior attorney at the Pacific Legal Foundation, said at the forum. "Money, legal personnel and a judiciary that's receptive to strategically selected and timed legal arguments."
Conservative groups and their backers now have all of those things, Mr. Schiff said, according to a video. In particular, "money's never going to be a problem," he said. "One can easily litigate to the Supreme Court on the cheap."
"Congratulations," responded David Doniger, a lawyer in attendance at the event who, 40 years ago, argued the original Chevron case on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "But to me, this is clothing nakedly private interests in highfalutin' constitutional arguments."
In an interview, Mr. Schiff said that cases like these were fast becoming the preferred way for groups to fight federal regulations. "When you compare how much impact that one can have on society through litigating, and especially winning in the Supreme Court, to lobbying with administrative agencies or through political campaigns," he said, "it's much more efficient."
His group, Pacific Legal Foundation, is part of a network of conservative research organizations that has received funding from Mr. Koch and other donors.
The Loper Bright case, now consolidated with a similar case involving fishermen from Rhode Island, has in many ways offered litigators a compelling story line of small businesses fighting for survival. The fishermen feature prominently on a page offering information on the case, promoted via Google ads.
"Nobody in a family business wants to be the last one to do it, everyone wants to pass it along, and my fear is I might not be able to," Stefan Axelsson, introduced as a third-generation commercial fisherman, says in one featured video, titled "Fishermen fight back against unlawful, job-killing government mandate." Mr. Axelsson couldn't be reached for comment.
The page doesn't mention the Koch affiliations, though a contact form generates an email to Cause of Action, as well as to Stand Together, a nonprofit group founded by Mr. Koch, who remains one of its donors.
The Cause of Action Institute has disclosed little of its funding: A year before it was created, the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling had enabled billions of dollars in spending by groups that don't disclose their donors.
Cause of Action's founder, Daniel Z. Epstein, had previously been an associate at the Charles G. Koch Foundation. The group's first known address was the same as that for Americans for Prosperity.
In an interview, Mr. Epstein, who later served as counsel to Donald J. Trump's first presidential campaign and transition team and is now an associate professor at St. Thomas University, said Cause of Action's work with fishermen hadn't been born of a motivation to overturn the Chevron doctrine. "It had everything to do with an observer program that spies on the fishermen," he said.
He declined to discuss funding.
Cause of Action has had two cash infusions, both from Mr. Koch's Stand Together, according to tax filings from Stand Together, including more than $ 4 million in 2019, and $ 1.1 million in 2020. In its most recent tax filing, covering the time when the fishermen's case was being worked on, the group reported having no employees. The case is being litigated by lawyers who work for Americans for Prosperity, including Mr. Mulvey.
The board that directs Cause of Action includes William Burck, who is managing partner at the law firm Quinn Emanuel, which has represented Koch Industries in litigation against environmental regulations. Mr. Burck is the lead lawyer in Koch Industries' defense in a separate case before the Supreme Court, the lawsuit filed by Minnesota accusing Koch and other oil and gas companies of undermining the public's understanding of the dangers of burning fossil fuels.
Other board members include Emily Seidel, the chief executive of Americans for Prosperity, formerly director of special projects for Koch Companies Public Sector, Koch Industries' lobbying arm; and Kurt Level, the current deputy general counsel at Koch Companies Public Sector.

War in Ukraine Pulls Oligarchs Off Their Perch: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Oligarchs have lost billions from the shelling of their factories, and the government has used its wartime powers to break their political influence.
For weeks, they fended off Russian assaults, holed up in a vast steel mill under barrages of missiles and mortars. And when the Ukrainian troops defending the Azovstal plant finally surrendered in May 2022, the mill had been reduced to rubble and twisted metal.
The fighting at Azovstal, in the besieged city of Mariupol, was a signature moment in the early months of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
It was also a major setback for Ukraine's richest man, the plant's owner.
With the destruction of Azovstal, the owner, Rinat Akhmetov, lost an industrial jewel accounting for one-fifth of Ukraine's steel output -- a multibillion-dollar loss that dealt a severe blow to his longtime grip on the Ukrainian economy.
Mr. Akhmetov's case underlines how the war, by ravaging Ukrainian industry, has curbed the power of the country's so-called oligarchs, tycoons who have long reigned over the economy and used their wealth to buy political influence, experts say.
In the war's first year, the total wealth of the 20 richest Ukrainians shrank by more than $ 20 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Mr. Akhmetov took the biggest hit, losing more than $ 9 billion. He is one of only two billionaires left in Ukraine, down from 10 before the war, according to The New Voice of Ukraine newspaper.
Now, the Ukrainian authorities plan to use their wartime powers to try to make a clean break with the oligarchs. The aim is to reduce their influence over the economy and politics, and to prosecute those who engaged in corrupt practices, carrying through on policies that President Volodymyr Zelensky had promised to pursue before the invasion.
"They are weak, and it's a unique opportunity to achieve justice in terms of how the country should be run," Denys Maliuska, Ukraine's justice minister, said in an interview.
The Ukrainian authorities say that these efforts are about rebuilding a postwar country that is more democratic and prosperous, and that they also show that they are fighting corruption, a crucial step to secure support from Western allies.
The crackdown could eliminate influence buying, but it may also reduce pluralism in Ukrainian politics and sideline some of Mr. Zelensky's opponents. Before the war, one of the highest-profile investigations of a businessman was against Mr. Zelensky's chief political rival, former President Petro O. Poroshenko, who made a fortune in the candy business. Mr. Poroshenko has avoided criticism of Mr. Zelensky since the start of the war, instead portraying himself as a loyalist ready to fight for his country.
Some critics also say the wartime concentration of power around the government may give rise to a new oligarchy, and analysts say that oligarchs still retain significant levers of influence.
"Oligarchs have all the resources they need to get their influence back," Mr. Maliuska said. "The risk is still present."
Like other Ukrainian tycoons, Mr. Akhmetov made his fortune in the 1990s, when newly independent Ukraine transitioned to a market economy that saw lucrative state-owned assets privatized cheaply. He took over Soviet-era coal and steel plants and built a business empire that also included major stakes in agriculture and transportation.
Dmytro Goriunov, an economist at the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy, said oligarchs had been a major obstacle to Ukraine's economic development, hampering competition through monopolies. Before the war, they controlled more than 80 percent of industries like oil refining and coal mining, according to a study he cowrote.
Experts say Ukrainian oligarchs used their profits to influence politics and the judiciary, as well as to buy or launch television channels to shape public opinion.
Mr. Akhmetov once owned up to 11 channels and supported Viktor Yanukovych, the former pro-Russia president whom Ukrainians ousted in 2014.
Unlike in Russia -- where oligarchs have largely fallen in line with the Kremlin under coercion or for self-interest -- rivalries among Ukrainian tycoons and their support of a wide-range of politicians have given Ukraine's media and political landscape greater variety.
Their large industrial and agricultural companies have also driven the economy, employing hundreds of thousands of people and attracting foreign investment.
But Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Action Center, said the oligarchs' stakes in business, politics and the news media had created a "vicious circle" where most levers of power were under their control, fueling corruption.
When Mr. Zelensky was elected president in 2019 -- with the support of a magnate, Ihor Kolomoisky -- he promised an all-out assault on the oligarchs. But his efforts, which included overhauling the judiciary and cracking down on corrupt public officials, "did not significantly decrease the influence of the oligarchs at that time," Mr. Maliuska said.
Then came Russia's invasion in February 2022.
As Moscow's attacks focused on Ukraine's east and south, the country's industrial heartland, many of the oligarchs' factories were decimated.
In Mariupol, Mr. Akhmetov's two giant steelworks, including Azovstal, were destroyed. So was the country's largest oil refinery, in central Ukraine, which was owned by Mr. Kolomoisky. Today, fierce fighting around the eastern city of Avdiivka has forced Europe's largest coke plant, another of Mr. Akhmetov's properties, to shut.
"My businesses have been affected the most by the war," Mr. Akhmetov said in written responses to questions. His wind and thermal power plants have been "exposed to constant Russian missile and drone attacks," and his steel and coke plants have been "severely damaged or temporarily occupied," he said.
Mr. Akhmetov's steel and mining group Metinvest lost nearly a third of its assets in the war's first year, according to the Center for Economic Strategy. Mr. Kolomoisky's oil assets shrank by two-thirds.
But it was perhaps the oligarchs' political influence that was hardest hit.
In the early days of the war, as the country rallied behind its president, oligarchs had little choice but to put aside their political agendas and help with the war effort.
Then, Mr. Zelensky signed a decree merging all cable news into a single program intended to counter Russian disinformation and boost morale -- depriving oligarchs with media arms of a crucial tool of influence. The program has been denounced as a way for the government to stifle criticism.
And by the summer of 2022, many tycoons had relinquished ownership of their media businesses to comply with a law passed before the war to curb their power. The law states that any person meeting three out of four criteria -- participation in politics, significant media influence, ownership of a business monopoly or wealth of at least $ 70 million -- will be designated an oligarch and barred from buying privatized state assets and funding political parties.
Mr. Akhmetov handed over the licenses for his television and print media to the state in July 2022. "I am not an oligarch in the legal sense of the word now," he said.
As the war went on, Ukrainian authorities cast a wider net in their prosecution of oligarchs.
In September, the police arrested Mr. Kolomoisky on suspicion of fraud and money laundering, and he has since been held in custody. The authorities are also trying to extradite Kostyantin Zhevago, a Ukrainian oligarch, from France on fraud charges, and another one, Dmytro Firtash, for embezzlement. Mr. Akhmetov is not facing personal legal proceedings.
"For decades, it was unimaginable to have an oligarch in a pretrial detention center," said Mr. Maliuska, the justice minister. "Now, this is a reality."
Mr. Maliuska acknowledged that "the power of the state is bigger" during the war, facilitating efforts to break free from the oligarchs' control over the economy. But he added that Ukraine's current crackdown was also aimed at earning anti-corruption credentials that are key to securing much-needed Western assistance.
The European Union, for instance, agreed to open accession talks for Ukraine last month but has stressed the need to build "a credible track record of investigations, prosecutions and final court decisions in high-level corruption cases."
It remains unclear how that will affect the powers of the oligarchs.
Mr. Goriunov, the economist, said Ukraine remained dependent on many of the oligarchs' businesses. Mr. Akhmetov's energy holding, DTEK, accounts for two-thirds of the country's thermal coal production.
Mr. Akhmetov, in his written comments, said he intended to play a role in the country's postwar reconstruction. "As the biggest Ukrainian investor, SCM will not sit on the sidelines," he said, referring to his holding company.
Some in Ukraine also fear the oligarchs will be replaced by a new oligarchic system emerging from the wartime concentration of power around the government.
Valeria Gontareva, who was Ukraine's central bank governor from 2014 to 2017, said she was concerned about the seizure of oligarchs' assets during the war and how government officials might use them for personal gain.
In late 2022, Mr. Kolomoisky's oil refinery and Mr. Zhevago's company AvtoKrAZ, which makes heavy trucks, were nationalized in what the authorities said was a way to secure vital military supplies. But some actions, such as the seizure of Mr. Zhevago's shares in mining plants, have been contentious and criticized as unjustified.
"It's state capitalism," Ms. Gontareva said. "Now the threat is not the old oligarchs, but the new ones who benefit from the war through the redistribution of assets and business segments."
Ms. Kaleniuk, of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, concurred. "In the fight against dragons," she said, "we have to be cautious not to become dragons ourselves."

KYIV, Ukraine — For weeks, they fended off Russian assaults, holed up in a vast steel mill under barrages of missiles and mortars. And when the Ukrainian troops defending the Azovstal plant finally surrendered in May 2022, the mill had been reduced to rubble and twisted metal.

Unlike in Russia — where oligarchs have largely fallen in line with the Kremlin under coercion or for self-interest — rivalries among Ukrainian tycoons and their support of a wide-range of politicians have given Ukraine’s media and political landscape greater variety.
Their large industrial and agricultural companies have also driven the economy, employing hundreds of thousands of people and attracting foreign investment.
But Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of Ukraine’s Anti-Corruption Action Center, said the oligarchs’ stakes in business, politics and the news media had created a “vicious circle” where most levers of power were under their control, fueling corruption.
When Zelenskyy was elected president in 2019 — with the support of a magnate, Ihor Kolomoisky — he promised an all-out assault on the oligarchs. But his efforts, which included overhauling the judiciary and cracking down on corrupt public officials, “did not significantly decrease the influence of the oligarchs at that time,” Maliuska said.
Then came Russia’s invasion in February 2022.
As Moscow’s attacks focused on Ukraine’s east and south, the country’s industrial heartland, many of the oligarchs’ factories were decimated.
In Mariupol, Akhmetov’s two giant steelworks, including Azovstal, were destroyed. So was the country’s largest oil refinery, in central Ukraine, which was owned by Kolomoisky. Today, fierce fighting around the eastern city of Avdiivka has forced Europe’s largest coke plant, another of Akhmetov’s properties, to shut.
“My businesses have been affected the most by the war,” Akhmetov said in written responses to questions. His wind and thermal power plants have been “exposed to constant Russian missile and drone attacks,” and his steel and coke plants have been “severely damaged or temporarily occupied,” he said.
Akhmetov’s steel and mining group Metinvest lost nearly one-third of its assets in the war’s first year, according to the Center for Economic Strategy. Kolomoisky’s oil assets shrank by two-thirds.
But it was perhaps the oligarchs’ political influence that was hardest hit.
In the early days of the war, as the country rallied behind its president, oligarchs had little choice but to put aside their political agendas and help with the war effort.
Then, Zelenskyy signed a decree merging all cable news into a single program intended to counter Russian disinformation and boost morale — depriving oligarchs with media arms of a crucial tool of influence. The program has been denounced as a way for the government to stifle criticism.
And by the summer of 2022, many tycoons had relinquished ownership of their media businesses to comply with a law passed before the war to curb their power. The law states that any person meeting three out of four criteria — participation in politics, significant media influence, ownership of a business monopoly or wealth of at least $70 million — will be designated an oligarch and barred from buying privatized state assets and funding political parties.
Akhmetov handed over the licenses for his television and print media to the state in July 2022. “I am not an oligarch in the legal sense of the word now,” he said.
As the war went on, Ukrainian authorities cast a wider net in their prosecution of oligarchs.
In September, police arrested Kolomoisky on suspicion of fraud and money laundering, and he has since been held in custody. Authorities are also trying to extradite Kostyantin Zhevago, a Ukrainian oligarch, from France on fraud charges, and another one, Dmytro Firtash, for embezzlement. Akhmetov is not facing personal legal proceedings.
“For decades, it was unimaginable to have an oligarch in a pretrial detention center,” said Maliuska, the justice minister. “Now, this is a reality.”
Maliuska acknowledged that “the power of the state is bigger” during the war, facilitating efforts to break free from the oligarchs’ control over the economy. But he added that Ukraine’s current crackdown was also aimed at earning anti-corruption credentials that are key to securing much-needed Western assistance.
The European Union, for instance, agreed to open accession talks for Ukraine last month, but has stressed the need to build “a credible track record of investigations, prosecutions and final court decisions in high-level corruption cases.”
It remains unclear how that will affect the powers of the oligarchs.
Goriunov, the economist, said Ukraine remained dependent on many of the oligarchs’ businesses. Akhmetov’s energy holding, DTEK, accounts for two-thirds of the country’s thermal coal production.
Akhmetov, in his written comments, said he intended to play a role in the country’s postwar reconstruction. “As the biggest Ukrainian investor, SCM will not sit on the sidelines,” he said, referring to his holding company.
Some in Ukraine also fear the oligarchs will be replaced by a new oligarchic system emerging from the wartime concentration of power around the government.
Valeria Gontareva, who was Ukraine’s central bank governor from 2014 to 2017, said she was concerned about the seizure of oligarchs’ assets during the war and how government officials might use them for personal gain.
In late 2022, Kolomoisky’s oil refinery and Zhevago’s company AvtoKrAZ, which makes heavy trucks, were nationalized in what authorities said was a way to secure vital military supplies. But some actions, such as the seizure of Zhevago’s shares in mining plants, have been contentious and criticized as unjustified.
“It’s state capitalism,” Gontareva said. “Now the threat is not the old oligarchs, but the new ones who benefit from the war through the redistribution of assets and business segments.”
Kaleniuk, of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, concurred. “In the fight against dragons,” she said, “we have to be cautious not to become dragons ourselves.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When is it appropriate to wear a fully matching sweatsuit, top and bottom? When I see people wearing a paired sweatshirt and sweatpants, I sometimes think "cringe." And sometimes I can't help but want to wear it. Which side of me is right?
Pepper, New York Karl Lagerfeld, the Chanel designer whose talent for dramatic pronouncements was equaled only by his talent for dreaming up extraordinary clothes, once declared sweatpants "a sign of defeat."
That pronouncement would suggest that the full sweatpants-and-sweatshirt look, otherwise known as the sweatsuit, a shapeless pairing once synonymous with gym teachers and Rocky Balboa, is ... well, what? A sign of surrender?
Perhaps. Or perhaps, given that this is fashion and in fashion nothing is more certain than that which was out will be in again, it is the embodiment of an ironically triumphant return.
In truth, the sweatsuit has been making a comeback since the coronavirus pandemic. That period, when we prized comfort dressing over just about everything else, converged with Gen Alpha's celebration of all things Y2K, including that era-defining item, the Juicy Couture velour sweatsuit. That discovery was exacerbated by the Miu Miu-driven resurgence of the "set," be it Miuccia Prada's matching crop top and tiny skirt, Versace's shortie pajamas or, yes, the matching sweatsuit of yore.
Demna, the designer of Balenciaga known for reframing the totems of streetwear as luxury, picked up on this idea, embracing not just a signature oversize hoodie but the tracksuit, via his Balenciaga collaboration with Adidas in 2022. It was a slicker, more globalized version of the sweatsuit, and one with its own cultural semiology thanks to hip-hop. Last month, he went a step further and paid homage to the Juicy sweatsuit in his fall 2024 show.
TikTok embraced the trend, with influencers of all sorts discovering the joy of sweats -- they don't call them that exactly; more on that in a moment -- especially as a solution to all things airport.
"Suits" have gotten a bad rap, but the notion of pairing your top and your bottom to create an unbroken line and to suggest coordination aforethought remains an effective approach to dress. The sweatsuit has evolved beyond the usual fleece and baggy proportions and is now available in materials like cashmere and wool, often with smaller tops paired with looser bottoms. I wouldn't use them for jogging, but they are good for swanning around.
The details matter. Wear a sweatsuit with a sweatband and sneakers and you look like a victim of the endless cycle of New Year's workout resolutions. Wear it with a nice handbag and a trench coat and you look like a modern Jean Harlow out to take the air.
It's really a question of framing. Yes, the sweatsuit as we once knew it may be dead, but long live the lounge suit. Or, as influencers like to call it, the "matching sweatsuit set." It's kind of like the reinvention of Target as Tar-gét. Same word, whole new implication.

Makeup With a Bigger Purpose: [Style Desk]

Full text: Karissa Bodnar played on her customers' desire to belong to something bigger than ... well, beauty.
On a recent Monday, Karissa Bodnar, the 34-year-old founder and chief executive of Thrive, a cosmetics company, arrived at a launch party for her latest product line. The setting: a fluorescent-lit, fifth-floor office in midtown Manhattan. The bells and whistles: cheese, crudités, basic beer and wine. The entertainment: a Bluetooth speaker playing early aughts hip-hop (Flo Rida, Lil Jon).
Over the next three hours, dozens of makeup artists, beauty editors and social media influencers accustomed to launch parties in far-flung locales like Tokyo and the South of France would drop by. Maybe.
"Respectfully, I don't care if editors and influencers show up or not," Ms. Bodnar said, surveying the windowless reception area. She wore a skirt suit of turquoise and silver sequins that cast a disco-ball glow across the floor. "I had $ 25,000 to spend, and I wasn't going to do a lunch at the Four Seasons or rent a house for the summer so influencers could go take selfies."
As far as beauty marketing goes, events like the two Ms. Bodnar cited are relatively thrifty. In January, Tarte conspicuously flew 50 influencers and their plus ones to Dubai and put them up at a Ritz-Carlton to celebrate the introduction of a foundation made with a "multitasking superfruit." Last year, Chanel flew influencers to Panama to fete a new beauty line; in 2017, Smashbox feted new products in Fiji.
For the April debut of Bigger Than Beauty, a set of skin-care products, Ms. Bodnar chose the headquarters of Bottomless Closet, a nonprofit that helps New York-area women in need enter the work force. "We found out about them through our community," Ms. Bodnar said. "We post on social media all the time and ask, 'What charities are moving you?"'
Thrive donated a million dollars of product but the real windfall for the nonprofit may have been the fairy godmother who chose to wave her wand over them.
"She's the star," Melissa Norden, the executive director of Bottomless Closet, said, gesturing at Ms. Bodnar. "People won't show up for us. They'll show up for her."
Much has been made of the Rihannas and Kylie Jenners of the beauty industry, celebrities who introduced best-selling cosmetics brands after developing an ardent following. One could argue that given the high profiles of their founders, Fenty Beauty and Kylie Cosmetics were destined for success. To build a brand -- and to fill a room -- Ms. Bodnar has played not on her name but on consumers' desire to do good with their dollars and belong to something bigger than ... well, beauty. Call her the Estée Lauder that hustle culture built.
"A lot of launch events would be at some swanky place," Ms. Bodnar told the assemblage. "I grew up on a dirt road. I don't know about you, but I'm kind of over the swanky events. I think this is the new swanky event -- being at places like Bottomless Closet." Cheers erupted.
'The Ultimate Unicorn'
If Ms. Bodnar was only about doing good, Thrive Causemetics -- the company's official name, one that gives pause to anyone with an ounce of skepticism -- would be a nonprofit.
"I've always thought of her as the ultimate unicorn," said Blythe Jack, a Thrive investor and a former partner at TSG Consumer, a private equity firm in San Francisco. "She built a wildly profitable business on almost no capital." Ms. Jack invested $ 100,000 in Thrive in 2017.
Thrive is a direct-to-consumer brand, avoiding the distribution fees associated with selling through Sephora or department stores. It's a common path for star-founded companies -- it's how Kylie Cosmetics started -- but star power can only do so much.
"Karissa was able to build community and brand loyalty before the marketplace got flooded and the pandemic shifted everything," said Priya Rao, the executive editor of the Business of Beauty, which chronicles the industry.
Thrive declined to comment on its annual revenues. "I don't want to be out there baring all to everybody," Ms. Bodnar said. "I've earned my spot."
The Reckoning
If Ms. Bodnar is cagey about specifics, it's because she has faced controversy. There's the plaintiff who sued Thrive in 2018, alleging that the company was not donating to charities in the way that it claimed. (The lawsuit resulted in a "stipulated" dismissal; Ms. Bodnar signed a non-disparagement agreement that precludes her from talking about it.) There are the trolls who harassed her on social media when Forbes added her, in 2019, to its "richest women" list.
"It was actually quite scary when that list came out," said Ms. Bodnar, who splits her time between Seattle and Los Angeles, where Thrive is headquartered.
Ms. Bodnar grew up in rural Washington State. "We went to church every Sunday, but Allure was my bible," she said. She worked at Sephora to pay her way through community college, which led to a job at the Seattle office of Clarisonic, a maker of a mechanical face brush that L'Oréal acquired in 2011.
"Among all these men on the team, she was very impressive," Carol Hamilton, the president for acquisitions for L'Oréal U.S.A., recalled. "She wanted to understand the 'why' of the work, how big companies operate."
In 2013, Ms. Bodnar's close friend, Kristy LeMond, who had been working in the nonprofit sector, died of soft tissue sarcoma, a rare cancer. Ms. Bodnar had a reckoning. She quit L'Oréal. She bought a bunch of makeup. She wrote a business plan in the notes app of her iPhone: vegan makeup with a business model that mimicked Toms and Warby Parker, the pioneers of the buy one, give one model.
She got a day job at Bulletproof, the supplement company, to finance her after-hours innovations, like false eyelashes that "work whether you have lashes or not," Ms. Bodnar said. "So much of what I heard in the beginning was, 'If a women's going through cancer, we tell her not to wear makeup.' I was like, 'That's not an acceptable response."'
Like any star, Thrive needed a breakout hit, and in 2014, Ms. Bodnar found hers: Liquid Lash Extensions, a mascara that encases eyelashes in tiny, ziti-like tubes. The mascara adheres to a degree that may find users ripping out their lashes if a generous amount of makeup remover isn't used to dissolve the residue.
Customers seemed unbothered. "Best mascara ever" reads a recent review on Thrive's website, one of more than 34,000 reviews posted for the mascara. "We sell one every five seconds," Ms. Bodnar said.
Social Conscience as a Strategy
Combined, Ms. Bodnar and Thrive have more than 830,000 Instagram followers; by comparison, L'Oréal U.S.A. has just over 150,000. Her direct messages with customers turn into real-life meet-ups: "This woman just invited me to run a half marathon," Ms. Bodnar said, showing her phone screen.
"The conglomerates are always looking to update their portfolios," Ms. Rao said, "and they're desperate to connect with millennial and Gen Z consumers in the way that Thrive has."
Ms. Bodnar said she has turned down offers to sell. What about an I.P.O.? "My goal is to donate a billion dollars," she said. Thus far, she has donated $ 125 million, which a public offering would likely preclude. "I'm not trying to create a flash-in-the-pan brand," she said.
Employee-generated content fuels Thrive's social media feeds as well as ire. An April, Instagram post of a male employee applying concealer, eyebrow gel and pressed powder generated a slew of hateful comments and disavowals like, "If this is turning into a 'woke' company, I'll stop buying."
"People get very upset about the L.G.B.T.Q.-plus and reproductive rights stances we take," Ms. Bodnar said. "I would have thought that those same people would care about our immigration support, but ...." She shrugged.
There are advantages to stoking discord.
"You might take a stance on a divisive issue because you know that your target customer is likely to take the same stance," said Jonah Berger, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "You may be doing it because you care about that issue, but you may also get attention from it."
Ms. Bodnar claims to care about making a difference but social conscience can also serve as a strategy. Half a dozen employees (the company has about 100, total) had filed in for a weekly product development meeting in a glass-walled conference room at Thrive headquarters on the west side of Los Angeles. Ms. Bodnar sat at the head of the table. Lipstick prototypes were smudged on hands and analyzed under varying shades of light. Someone brought up their competition.
"That makes me think of one of my favorite books," Ms. Bodnar said. "The Infinite Game" by Simon Sinek. "We think that business is a finite game," she said, "but you can't win a business in the same way that you can't win a friendship, or a marriage. He talks about worthy rivals."
"Who's a worthy rival?" she asked the room.
One employee: "Lululemon."
Another: "Patagonia."
Ms. Bodnar smiled. No one had mentioned another makeup brand. "OK," she said. "What's next?"

Full text: This week we introduce a new format for Galleries with one critic at the helm, searching out new artists and some of the most notable exhibitions. Here, Roberta Smith covers the New York debut of Sagarika Sundaram along with shows by Robert Ryman, Blair Saxon-Hill and Clintel Steed.
Robert Ryman
Through Feb. 3. David Zwirner, 537 West 20th Street; Manhattan; 212-517-8677; davidzwirner.com.
Robert Ryman is best known for a devotion to all-white paintings that made the most of the medium's physical properties, warding off monotony with a staggering variety of paints, paint brushes, brush strokes, surfaces and wall fastenings. He came to New York in 1952, planning to study jazz saxophone, but was blown off course by visits to New York museums and working as a guard at the Museum of Modern Art for much of the 1950s. In 1953 he bought paints and canvas board to see, as he once said, "what the paint would do." By 1959 he had made what he considered his first painting: a square canvas painted bright orange. Then white took over.
The most interesting pieces in this over-full exhibition of 25 works from 1961-64 reveal that things weren't quite so simple. In a series of works from 1961, luscious fields, ostensibly of white, are frequently painted over strokes of red, blue or green, enacting a kind of refusal of color. He also toyed with "illusion" -- the bugaboo of 1960s abstraction and its devotion to the physical nature of the art object. In "One Down" (1962), Ryman penciled off five small squares on a square expanse of light brown linen and painted them with white-over-color textures, creating the startling illusion of paintings (or studies) hanging on a studio wall. In other words, gadzooks, he turned abstract painting into a representational, even trompe l'oeil picture! In "62" Square" (around 1964), he even gave one of the paintings-within-a-painting a red frame. No wonder this intriguing little apostasy has been out of sight.
Sagarika Sundaram
Through Feb. 4. Palo Gallery, 30 Bond Street, Manhattan, 646-877-1469, palogallery.com.
Wool felt is a marvel. It is one of the oldest of human-made fabrics and it remains ubiquitous, figuring in everything from slippers to aircraft gaskets.
Felt also has artistic possibilities aplenty, some of which are explored in "Source," the sumptuous New York debut of Sagarika Sundaram, who was born in Kolkata, India, in 1986, earned an M.F.A. in textiles from Parsons School of Design/The New School and lives in Brooklyn.
The dozen works here begin with a piece of white felt, lying flat, onto which Sundaram layers raw wool and yarn-like strands or pieces of dyed felt. This sandwich is then subjected to moisture and heat and a great deal of pressure, fusing into a single somewhat bumpy textile.
The show contains several beguiling small felt pieces including two rough-edged books whose pages read as dazzling little color studies. Less successful is the monumental "Source," consisting of four or five large ellipses hanging together in folds. These elements can evoke immense leaves, shells or tents, each with its own motifs and combinations of dark red, brown and white natural dyes. But it seems unfocused, like a series of tryouts. It is also familiar, reprising craft-oriented art from the 1970s.
The masterpiece here is the vibrant "Atlas," a small mural whose shapes and lines and blazing colors suggests a topographical map, tangled undergrowth or Lynda Benglis latex pour piece. You could say it's all figure and no ground, an exercise in exquisitely controlled chaos. Unlike paint, felt grants each bit of color an electrifying separateness. "Atlas" belongs in a museum.
Blair Saxon-Hill and Clintel Steed
Through Feb. 3. Shrine Gallery, 368 Broadway, Manhattan, 212-381-1395, shrine.nyc.
This pair of solo shows leads with the New York debut of paintings by the Los Angeles artist Blair Saxon-Hill, 44, who exhibited large monotypes here in 2022, at Pace Prints.
Saxon-Hill, who was born in Eugene, Ore., in 1979, works with untroubled ease and zero pretension, when painting her still lifes of wilting flowers or inhabited interiors. Her clumsy figures evince a very late version of what was once called the School of Paris, an intuitive fusion of direct drawing and painting that descended from Matisse and Picasso.
Yet Saxon-Hill's paintings capture a malaise that seems very contemporary, very post-Covid. The bouquets of flowers, alone or in the interiors, are usually dying, dropping their seeds. The exception is the combination of lilacs and persimmons in "Flowers for Alice Neel." They are the healthiest in the show but they reappear in worse shape, in "Persimmon at Night," in which a woman lolls listlessly on a table, clutching a persimmon in one hand.
In "Power of Now," a woman in red, with a persimmon wall looming behind her, seems to shrink from the newspaper open on the table before her. The anxieties in "The News" are more ambiguous. It centers on a large piece of paper that appears to be a drawing of thick severed limbs covering the lap of a woman whose precarious black coiffure is indicated by a calligraphic swirl. She seems straight out of a drag show or a Japanese erotic woodblock and looks dismayed. Is she thinking "Too much carnage" or maybe just "Too much Picasso"? The show's title looks to the future with a fatalistic phrase from the Japanese poet Issa, "Even Then Flowers Bloom."
In Shrine's second gallery, the veteran painter Clintel Steed, 46, offers an interesting contrast to Saxon-Hill's smooth, suave surfaces with ones whose short thick brushstrokes can pile up like little bricks. Steed, who was born in Salt Lake City and now lives in Peekskill, N.Y., has used this robust, somewhat combative style of paint handling for some time, letting it both fragment and energize his subjects, which have ranged from landscapes to reprises of old master paintings, and have varied in their effectiveness.
The new paintings are smallish close-ups of the faces of professional football players on the field, in helmets, behind face guards. There's a lot to work with here given the equipment -- which includes visors that reflect small cityscapes -- and the players' usually fierce expressions. The results are very concentrated, almost explosive, weirdly semi-Cubist in structure and likely some of Steed's best paintings. Once you sort out their images, you have to decide if the face guards protect or cage the men, most of whom are Black. Either way their gear personifies the inordinate pressure to succeed that afflicts so many in and around this violent game. The show is titled "Portraits of the Indomitable," which simplifies the work's complexity.
Last Chance
Ed Atkins
Through Jan. 6. Gladstone Gallery, 530 West 21st Street, Manhattan; 212-206-7606, gladstonegallery.com.
The British artist Ed Atkins is screening a double feature of recent video projections in Gladstone's Chelsea space.
Atkins's 16-minute "Pianowork 2" plunges deep inside the so-called uncanny valley, where digital simulations come close to perfect realism and seem the weirder for it. Using motion-capture technology, Atkins recorded himself playing a modernist piece for piano; the collected data was then turned into a nearly perfect digital animation of the same scene -- "nearly" being the operative word. Atkins's avatar emotes at the keyboard, just as any human pianist might -- as we assume Atkins did, playing -- but tiny glitches tell us that we are watching a digital creature that could never feel real emotions.
With traditional animation, we'd know that everything onscreen came from someone's imagination; with a traditional video recording, we'd assume the scene had some real-world analogue. But "Pianowork 2" suggests the real, while making sure we don't trust it.
Its companion at Gladstone, an 80-minute projection called "Sorcerer," is a collaboration with the writer Steven Zultanski. It seems like the straightforward record of a theatrical piece: Two women and a man recite lines on a set that more or less recreates someone's living room; their dialogue sounds like the almost-random chatter of friends, transcribed direct from life. Without going digital, this results in some of the same tensions as "Pianowork 2": The transcribed chatter evokes the real, but putting it onstage is all about artifice.
Maybe the uncanny valley has always been a place where human culture likes to hang out. BLAKE GOPNIK
Kayode Ojo
Through Jan. 6. 52 Walker, 52 Walker Street, Manhattan. 212-727-1961; 52Walker.com.
"Basic Instinct" is one of 17 separate arrangements of ready-made objects in Kayode Ojo's "Eden," the latest brilliant show programmed at 52 Walker by the senior gallery director, Ebony L. Haynes. It comprises a Baxton Studio Jericho Leather Accent Chair in white and chrome; a three-foot-square beveled mirror; four clear plastic boxes, each about six inches high; and a medium-format Graflex camera from the 1970s.
Sitting on the chair at exactly crotch height, its lens pointing out, the camera evokes Sharon Stone's most famous moment in the movie of the same title. In so doing, the camera also highlights the ambiguous line between exhibitionism and voyeurism, and how wrapped up they both are in status, culture and consumerism. It evokes the strange nostalgia, with its aftertaste of mortality, inherent in any technology that "captures a moment," especially photography; and it offers an incisive metaphor, if a cold one, for what it means to be human. What are we, after all, but empty boxes looking for ourselves in the mirror?
Elsewhere in the show, Ojo reflects on religion, sexuality and performance. He uses chandeliers, cocktail dresses, an enormous bird cage, dozens of flutes and a family Bible embossed with his name; a pocket watch the size of a wall clock sways gently above the floor. But I kept coming back to the four plastic boxes that hold the Baxton chair above its mirrored base. Offering a slight remove, but a transparent one, at once showy and discreet, they seemed like the key to Ojo's method. WILL HEINRICH
Ali Cherri
Through Jan. 7. Swiss Institute, 38 St. Marks Place, Manhattan; 212-925-2035; swissinstitute.net.
On the second floor of Ali Cherri's exhibition "Humble and Quiet and Soothing as Mud," there is a video projected onto three screens. Titled "Of Men and Gods and Mud" (2022), it shows laborers fashioning mud into bricks who toil in the shadow of the Merowe Dam in northern Sudan, the construction of which displaced about 50,000 people and caused significant social and environmental upheaval.
Women's voices (one speaking English, one Arabic) narrate: "Somewhere, by the banks of a great river, on the banks of a gargantuan dam, a man stands waist deep in mud. ..." The language seems less documentary than mythic, akin to the many creation stories (Sumerian, Abrahamic, Maori, Hindu, Yoruba) in which the material plays a central role. The effect is to telescope time, so that contemporary geopolitical and environmental catastrophes are read against primeval creation and destruction -- perhaps, the Lebanese-born Cherri suggests, we are living in another antediluvian moment, just before the dam breaks.
Mud -- as material and symbol -- is also explored in four sculptures on the ground floor related to the ancient Sumerian hero Gilgamesh and the molding of his companion, Enkidu, who was molded from clay. Despite their seeming fragility, these figures cast fierce-looking shadows on the walls. Standing in for their faces are archaeological relics -- from Egypt, Mali, the Kongo kingdom, France -- that the artist bought from auctions, their prices reflecting current monetary and cultural valuations. In Cherri's work, past and present are never separate or even distant -- a gently devastating argument against the idea that as a species, we've progressed. ARUNA D'SOUZA
Christian Walker
Through Jan. 7. Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art, 26 Wooster Street, Manhattan; 212-431-2609, leslielohman.org.
For reasons sometimes hard to know, treasurable artists drop from the radar. Having them back in sight is a gift and Leslie-Lohman Museum delivers one in "Christian Walker: The Profane and the Poignant," a first survey of a photographer who had an art world presence in the 1980s and 1990s -- he made a notable contribution to, among other shows, "Black Male" at the Whitney Museum -- and has since been all but forgotten.
Born in 1953, Walker was active in Boston's early gay liberation movement. His first major photographic series, "The Theater Project," documented the city's red-light district, the infamous Combat Zone, as it was known, that drew both gay and straight people. In his next series, "Miscegenation," he took the intimate mingling of Black and white male bodies as a subject, at a time when the gay rights movement was largely white, and did so using an experimental technique of applying pigments directly to photographic prints.
Much of Walker's career coincided with the AIDS crisis. The toll in lives it took, and the race-based inequities it revealed, became major themes for him. A larger consciousness of loss thrums through his art, evident in portraits of family and friends early and late. Eventually he became lost himself. In the mid-1990s, he moved to Seattle, where he cut off most of his East Coast contacts, lived for a time on the street, and died, most likely of a drug overdose, in 2003.
His work survives only in bits and pieces. The Leslie-Lohman show, organized by Jackson Davidow and Noam Parness, is an act of hunter-gatherer persistence, and a heroic one: a generous tribute to a memorable artist, and a gift to an audience for whom he has been restored. HOLLAND COTTER
Mario Schifano
Through Jan. 8. Magazzino Italian Art, 2700 Route 9, Cold Spring, N.Y.; 845-666-7202, magazzino.art.
Pop Art finally arrived in 1962, when Andy Warhol and 28 playful upstarts, displaying their wares in "New Realists" at the Sidney Janis Gallery, drove Mark Rothko, the master of sober, hovering shapes of color, to leave the gallerist in a pique.
One New Realist must have needled with special force: the proto-punk Mario Schifano. For across the 80 works in his big new exhibition, "Mario Schifano: the Rise of the '60s," it becomes obvious that this Italian interpreter of Coca-Cola (a logo he loves to quote) understood the goals of Abstract Expressionism even while he mocked them.
As with Rothko, his muse was the square -- just the wrong kind. In pencil Schifano drafts rounded squares inside crisp-cornered ones, replicating the era's tube televisions. Into them he mortars sloppy brushloads of enamel paint, the pigment of outdoor signage. In "Elemento per Paesaggio" (1962), squares stack up helter-skelter, recalling TVs in a pawnshop window.
Elsewhere, color lampoons consumer choice. In two untitled works from 1961, one square wears a yellow-and-cobalt reminiscent of the Spam tin, while the other is done in the signature cream-and-crimson of Coke. Across each foreground, Schifano draws a cartoon rope seat and bucket, vacant, as if the billboard painter has just taken lunch.
Schifano knew that studio painting had, through reproduction, joined mass media. Where Rothko's generation yearned for pure, unmediated color, Schifano submits to modernity's mediator: the screen. It's fitting that in the stillness of the Magazzino's Brutalist pavilion, no titles or dates clutter the exhibition. For those, you must download the app. WALKER MIMMS
Alen MacWeeney
Through Jan. 7. New York Public Library, 476 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan; 917-275-6975, nypl.org/events/exhibitions.
Has there been another exhibition whose venue so perfectly suits its art? In one of the slender halls on the third floor of the New York Public Library's Fifth Avenue headquarters, a civic landmark, hang photos shot in the slender cars of the New York subway, another symbol of the city. Walk down the hall at N.Y.P.L., and you might be on a platform looking into a stopped train: In one car, a weary-looking straphanger scowls while a rider in a head scarf and coat looks beatific; in another, a young woman ogles a dandy.
The Irish photographer Alen MacWeeney, 84, took these 44 photos in 1977 after arriving in Manhattan to work for Richard Avedon. They nod to the subway shots of Walker Evans from four decades earlier, with one major difference: In most of them, MacWeeney cleverly enlarges two subway shots onto one sheet of photo paper; with no seam between them, they register as a continuous scene. That gives each print a subtle surrealism, as we absorb the breach in space and time across its two photos without recognizing that they began life separately: A woman rests her eyes in a car that, thanks to MacWeeney, appears to have expanded into a maze of graffitied walls; another car seems to show its inside and outside at once, like a Möbius strip.
"The chance encounter of a sewing machine and an umbrella on an operating table" -- that phrase by Isidore Lucien Ducasse is supposed to capture surrealism's signature weirdness. But what about the encounter of an umbrella with another moment in its own existence? That's the more peculiar strangeness we find in MacWeeney's subway. BLAKE GOPNIK

'Landing: A Group Exhibition'
Through Jan. 13. Goodman Gallery, 23 East 67th Street, Manhattan; 347-249-8994, goodman-gallery.com.
A few decades back, when the Museum for African Art existed, New York City regularly saw lots of the new work coming from South Africa, much of it courtesy of loans from Goodman Gallery, which had opened in Johannesburg in 1966 and nurtured a stellar roster of artists, Black and white, during the apartheid years. When the museum closed, the South African flow to New York stopped, but now promises to resume with the opening of a Goodman branch in Manhattan.
And a very welcome resumption it is, to judge from a small inaugural group show that's both a blast from the past and a quickstep into the future. Most of the work here is by artists whom Goodman put on the map years ago. Some -- David Goldblatt, William Kentridge -- are now international fixtures. Others -- Dumile Feni (1942-1991), Lucas Sithole (1931-1994) and David Koloane (1938-2019) -- are historical figures who will reward wider exposure and study here.
Sue Williamson, a dynamic amazement now in her early 80s, gets a micro-retrospective here in the form of five works dating from 1984 to this year. And Sam Nhlengethwa, whose figurative work has never looked more prescient, provides a bridge from a pioneering generation to a new one represented by the Zimbabwean painter Misheck Masamvu, born in 1980.
Goodman has broadened its roster to include artists from the larger African diaspora, though South Africa's contribution to the global scene continues to be the heart of its program. Lucky New York will now be able to follow it all. HOLLAND COTTER
Trey Abdella
Through Jan. 13. Vito Schnabel, 455 West 19th Street, Manhattan; 646-216-3932, vitoschnabel.com.
Through Jan. 13. David Lewis, 57 Walker Street, Manhattan; 212-966-7991, davidlewisgallery.com.
Trey Abdella's work attacks the idea of "surface." In both of the show's venues, portraits of women have been perforated by small doors, swung open one a day to reveal fragrant hunks of chocolate. An 8-by-6-foot canvas, encrusted with epoxy, foam, glitter and acrylic paint, gives a macro view of a slice of cherry pie -- an animated sparkle, displayed on a whirling 3-D "hologram fan," marks the fork piercing the crust. Thick dioramas show a monstrous sculpted trout breaching a lake's plastic surface, or a rubber heart throbbing inside a treehouse seen through the slats of a rib cage. Piling gunk onto, cutting through, rejecting the limits of: No picture plane is safe.
But Abdella also needs surfaces -- his sculptures cling to the wall, and every bizarre scene depends on the viewer's gaze having an image to penetrate. The horrific "Sealed With a Kiss" comprises an acrylic painting of white skin, on which perches a spiny, motorized mosquito the size of a corgi. Its rubbery proboscis visibly draws red fluid through the canvas into its transparent abdomen, then spits it back into some hidden reservoir. The pièce de résistance, though (at David Lewis -- the only free-standing piece), is a looming cross-section of human skin blended with a model town -- a scale railroad loops around the paper lawn beneath cloudlike pockets of yellow fat, while rabbit warrens mottle the soil underneath. Abdella's work explodes what we take for 2-D to expose its texture, gore and depth, and dwells there. TRAVIS DIEHL
Cynthia Lahti
Through Jan. 13. James Fuentes, 55 Delancey Street, Manhattan; 212-577-1201, jamesfuentes.com.
There's a contrary beauty to Cynthia Lahti's gloopy ceramic figures, like some romantic ideal chewed on and emerging gnarled, but more emotionally recognizable for it. Her figures appear like dazed Meissen porcelains, jolted from their lives of leisure into messier, more honest ones. Their poses are a taxonomy of anxiety -- hunched, slumped, sheltering a cigarette against a nonexistent gust -- with expressions that strain legibility, though whether a face is pinched in pain or perturbation is mostly a matter of degrees. "Green Lady" (2011), its mottled coloring closer to oxidized metal, is either overcome by anguish or shielding her eyes from the sun. Either way, she's not having a nice time.
The anatomical deformities of several of the figures speak to an awareness of the body's fragility and all that can go wrong with it. "Sock" (2009) depicts a body from the waist down in a kind of reverse bust: exaggerated, uneven limbs and detached appendages floating helplessly alongside, an effect that's both comic and grisly.
As with Manet's visible brushstrokes, Lahti's thumbed-clay forms aren't ashamed to display the marks of their making. And yet, with their craggy surfaces, inexact glazes and abstracted, barely-there forms, they can look more like accidents of nature, and looking at them can feel like finding the rough contours of a face in a slab of rock. Akin to the pitted wabi-sabi of Japanese Mino ware, Lahti's figures suggest an acceptance of imperfection and a contentment with the unfinished -- a freedom in their flaws. MAX LAKIN
Olga Balema
Through Jan. 13. Bridget Donahue, 99 Bowery, Manhattan; 646-896-1368, bridgetdonahue.nyc.
Olga Balema's "The Third Dimension" is the punkest show in town. In the same way that 1970s punk rock was stripped down, anti-virtuosic (no ostentatious guitar solos) and anti-establishment, Balema's clear plastic sculptures are blunt-but-beautiful statements that challenge both the art market's ravenous appetite for painting and the rampant virtue signaling among many of art's players (including artists and critics).
What there is to see here -- or not see, since the gallery initially seems empty when you enter it -- are 11 sculptures Balema made by bending translucent polycarbonate sheets into geometric forms. Some of the works lean against the wall; all are mysteriously titled "Loop" (2023) and assigned a number. They're a bit like soap bubbles, threatening to vanish at any moment.
What makes Balema's efforts art and not mere provocation are context and history. Her work is clearly in conversation with "heroic," masculinist, minimalist sculpture crafted in marble, bronze or steel. Its virtually see-through, plain plastic materials may goad some viewers to call it the emperor's new clothes, except that the empty-gallery-as-philosophically-significant-void is yet another celebrated trope in art history, particularly when enacted by male artists. (It's become a signature gesture for Balema, whose last exhibition at Bridget Donahue in 2019 was an artless web of elastic bands stretched across the floor, titled "Brain Damage.")
In the current moment, this show speaks powerfully to the utopian promises of avant-garde art. Who gets to be free? In music, punk rock and free jazz answered this call; in visual art, we have this. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
John Wesley
Through Jan. 26. Elkon Gallery, 18 East 81st Street, Manhattan; 212-535-3940, elkongallery.com.
"Utter sweetness crossed with an underlying eroticism" is how the critic Peter Schjeldahl, writing in The New York Times 50 years ago, described the up-and-coming Pop artist John Wesley.
Wesley, who died last year at 93, borrowed images from comics, domestic romance and Americana, then arranged them into flat, pastel cartoons suffused with sexualized humor. Think Ken Price's interiors or Alex Katz's faces, with a Freudian tingle.
Whimsy abounds in the 15 works at Elkon Gallery. "Boxing Gloves" (1968) lines up three fighters like Rockettes, each engulfed to his waist by a black glove, with the lace from the glove binding his legs.
But more than bondage, this family-friendly selection boasts Wesley's play with form -- the reason, I imagine, why the arch-minimalist Donald Judd devoted a gallery to him in Marfa.
Up close, Wesley's outline wavers wildly. From afar, it lands with surprising, loaded precision. While the eight cyclists of "Tour de France" (1974), hunched illogically, barely kiss the edge of their painted frame, one front-runner's tire flops over the guideline as if to announce, "I'm winning!" In "George Washington Crossing the Delaware" (1976), a sendup of Emanuel Leutze's epic across the street at the Met, two patriots regain their footing in a wobbly dinghy. Overhead, a long cloud intrudes upon the myth, connecting left margin to right with a bridge of clean, unpainted gesso.
Outlines, placements, perimeters -- each fourth-wall breaking. The effect is of someone who worked quickly (in fast-drying acrylics) and whose visions were informed by an intrusive American memory. WALKER MIMMS
'Wild Style 40'
Through Jan. 13. Jeffrey Deitch, 18 Wooster Street, Manhattan; 212-343-7300, deitch.com.
Shot in 1980 in No Wave's deliberate anti-style, "Wild Style," Charlie Ahearn's loosely stitched film of early hip-hop culture among the Bronx's bombed-out blocks, trades auteurism for zeal, ceding conventions like script and plot to the pure invention of its stars. It documents the progenitors of hip-hop -- graffitists, MCs, and b-boys -- and is itself a foundational article of that culture, pointed to as legitimizing evidence of a movement whose effects continue to color the city's self-image.
This show straddles memorabilia -- production stills by Martha Cooper and Cathleen Campbell; Zephyr and Revolt's fizzy title card animation cels -- and the output of the film's aerosol contingent who transitioned from train yards to gallery walls, a codified roster of artists often named in the same breath: Lee Quiñones, Rammellzee, Sharp, Daze, Crash, Lady Pink, Futura, Dondi and Phase 2. Also included are artists like Martin Wong and John Ahearn, who didn't work in the mode but are considered sympathetic to it. The split is between nostalgia and continuum. A sullen, jaundiced KAWS bronze is the most conspicuous example of the movement's legacy, even as he has long abandoned his tagger roots. Its presence represents the completion of the formal art world's incursion, a process that the film treated with subtle ambivalence.
There is a joyousness in the longevity of style writing's surviving pioneers. But if the form's chief characteristic is its endless reinvention, you only need to walk around the corner to Thompson Street, to an empty lot ringed with fresh tags, to find the tradition alive. MAX LAKIN
'Edward Hopper as Puritan'
Through Feb. 17. Craig Starr Gallery, 5 East 73rd Street, Manhattan, 212-570-1739, craigstarr.com
"Edward Hopper as Puritan" is a compact exhibition devoted to a world-famous American painter that nonetheless looks remarkably fresh. For one thing, its display of nine works mostly from the 1920s -- etchings, watercolors, charcoal drawings and a single painting -- in a tiny gallery encourages a thrilling intimacy with the changes in Hopper's mark-making and surfaces across mediums.
The show concentrates on the more austere side of his sensibility, which is most evident in his nonurban scenes. Houses, sailboats and the ocean are the main characters; humans, if present, are dwarfed.
The etchings give early signs of Hopper's powers of observation and touch: Their varied textures verge on flamboyant. In "The Henry Ford," a schooner's towering sails evoke an immense white bird settling into its nest. In contrast, the watercolors of saltboxes or a Victorian house abstain from the dazzling effects this medium encourages. The charcoals -- another Victorian and a boat on a wharf -- are so strikingly solid and finished they might be graphite.
"Two Puritans" (1945), the oil, depicts a pair of white houses whose awkward volumes flatten primly toward the picture plane and exemplify Hopper's careful rhyming of colors. Everything is pristinely flat except on four trees, which scramble several hues into a bark-like roughness.
In the catalog's exceptional essay, Louis Shadwick, a British art historian, explores the social and racial implications of terms like Puritan and Anglo-Saxon, which early writers applied admiringly to Hopper's art. Combining a meticulous presentation of evidence with something like psychoanalysis, he reveals far more layers of political meaning than are usually achieved these days. ROBERTA SMITH

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Dr. Christmas overcame race and gender barriers to run New York's mental health agency under three mayors in the 1970s.
June Jackson Christmas, a psychiatrist who broke barriers as a Black woman by heading New York City's Department of Mental Health and Retardation Services under three mayors, died on Sunday in the Bronx. She was 99.
Her daughter, Rachel Christmas Derrick, said she died in a hospital of heart failure.
As a city commissioner, as chief of rehabilitation services at Harlem Hospital Center, and in her role overseeing the transition of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare to a Democratic administration for President-elect Jimmy Carter, Dr. Christmas ardently advanced her professional agenda.
Her priorities included improving mental health services for older people, helping people cope with alcoholism, and assisting children ensnared in the bureaucracies of foster care and the legal system. She also sought to ease the transition of patients from being warehoused in state mental hospitals to living independently.
Dr. Christmas publicly championed civil rights from an early age. She staged a sit-down strike at a segregated roller skating rink in Cambridge, Mass., when she was 14, and she later broke ground as a Black woman in education, employment and housing.
June Antoinette Jackson was born on June 7, 1924, in Boston. Her mother, Lillian Annie (Riley) Jackson, was a homemaker who had worked at the Charlestown Navy Yard in Boston during World War II and as a state tax assessor. Her father, Mortimer Jackson, was a postal worker who fought for the advancement of Black workers in the union and civil service hierarchy.
At school, June and other Black students were never asked to identify their ancestry on "I Am an American Day" -- a snub she never questioned, she said in an interview conducted in 2016 for StoryCorps by her son Vincent, because "I think it was the reality of how we just accepted racism."
Her father, she recalled in the same interview, "would always get the highest score, often perfect, and never be offered the position."
One year, she said, she and a classmate who was also Black sold more Girl Scout cookies than anyone else in their troop, but the minister's wife who headed the troop informed her that she would not be able to claim her prize in another town because "those camps, they've really never taken any Negroes."
Her father's advice? "Be twice as good as everybody else," she recalled.
But, she added, "It seems to me that I've often been in places where if you wanted to make life better for yourself, you had to work to make life better for everybody."
She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology in 1945 from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where she was one of the first three women who identified as Black to graduate. She went on to receive a medical degree in psychiatry from the Boston University School of Medicine in 1949.
She did her internship at Queens General Hospital and her residency at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. She received a certificate in psychoanalysis from the William Alanson White Institute, also in Manhattan.
In 1953, she married Walter Christmas, a founder of the Harlem Writers Guild, who handled publicity for a number of firms and organizations and at one point was public relations director for the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York. He died in 2002.
In addition to their daughter, a travel writer, she is survived by their son Gordon, a photographer, and four grandchildren. Their son Vincent, who worked for the city mental health agency his mother once headed, died in 2021.
Dr. Christmas initially practiced privately, then worked as a psychiatrist for the Riverdale Children's Association in New York from 1953 to 1965.
In 1964 she founded Harlem Rehabilitation Center, a Harlem Hospital program, which gained a national reputation for providing vocational training and psychiatric help to psychiatric hospital patients who had returned to their communities after being discharged. From 1964 to 1972, she was also the principal investigator on research projects for the National Institute of Mental Health.
In 1972, after serving briefly as a deputy commissioner, Dr. Christmas was appointed commissioner of the Department of Mental Health and Retardation Services by Mayor John V. Lindsay. She was reappointed in 1973 by Mayor Abraham D. Beame (she took a two-month leave to head Jimmy Carter's 12-member transition team) and again in 1978 by Mayor Edward I. Koch.
She was a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, a professor of behavioral science at the City University of New York School of Medicine and resident professor of mental health policy at the Heller Graduate School of Social Welfare of Brandeis University in Massachusetts.
In 1980, Dr. Christmas became the first Black woman president of the American Public Health Association. She was also a founder of the Urban Issues Group, a research institute, and served as its executive director from 1993 to 2000.
Reflecting on her career in 2020, Dr. Christmas concluded that "the barrier of racism is greater than being a woman."
"I interviewed for a residency, and the man who was interviewing me said he was concerned that I, as an African American woman, would be too sexually stimulating to men patients," she told The Women in Medicine Legacy Foundation.
"When I was looking for an office in Manhattan in the 1960s, at least a third of the agents I spoke with on the telephone said they could guarantee me that there were no Blacks or Puerto Ricans in the building," she added. "It was so hard to find a place to live that my husband and I wound up going to court, where we prevailed."
Having been exposed to racial discrimination since childhood, Dr. Christmas said, she was imbued with a commitment to minimize prejudice. She became a psychiatrist, she recalled, because she believed that "maybe if I went into psychiatric medicine I could teach people not to be racist."
Her strategy was individualistic, she said, invoking a proverb -- "Each one, teach one" -- rooted in American slavery when Black people were denied an education and literacy was conveyed from one person to another.

Full text: Under the handle Tanner Leatherstein, Volkan Yilmaz rips, burns and slices apart luxury goods to show how much he thinks they are really worth.
One video opens with a large white leather handbag covered in the signature LV logo of Louis Vuitton. Within milliseconds, a hand with a switchblade swoops in and slashes a huge gash in the side of the bag before tearing it apart at its seams. In another, the distinctive red sole of Christian Louboutin is loudly ripped from a black stiletto using a wrench; in still another, scissors snip through a $ 2,200 Prada clutch before a man sets fire to a piece of the leather and turns it to ash.
You've entered the TikTok world of Tanner Leatherstein, which has more than 950,000 followers. Leatherstein, whose real name is Volkan Yilmaz, has attracted a cult following on the social media platform -- as well as on YouTube and Instagram -- for his butchering of exorbitantly expensive items. The reason, he says, is to show his viewers the true quality of the materials and craftsmanship and then break down how much the item may have cost to make.
"In many cases," Mr. Yilmaz said from his Dallas workshop in December, "my estimates come in at about a tenth of what the price tag says. The markups that underpin the luxury business still shock a lot of people."
In the edited interview below, Mr. Yilmaz, 37, discussed his lifelong obsession with leather, how much he spends on luxury products for his platform and what people should look for when buying new leather items.
When did your love of leather goods begin?
My family owned a tannery in Turkey, so I was born into the business. Around 11, I tanned five sheepskins to make my first leather jacket. While at college in Istanbul, I worked at the tannery, then went to China to learn about leather imports and exports and then to Turkmenistan.
In 2009, I won the U.S. green card lottery and moved to Chicago. I drove a cab while I got an MBA from the University of Illinois, then worked as a management consultant, which made me feel like I was dying inside. I was still obsessed with leather, so I started my own leather brand called Pegai, teaching myself about the design side from YouTube and driving Uber jobs to make ends meet. In 2019, once the business was underway, I moved to Dallas.
Why did you start creating social media content?
Friends and even friends of friends have always asked me to check their leather purchases. What do I think of the quality? Have they paid too much?
It made me realize that people don't actually know that much about how leather is sourced or used and are suspicious about the markups on luxury leather products. So I started making some videos to answer their questions. I didn't expect them to blow up the way they have.
More than anything else, you are known for slicing up bags. Why do you do that?
When I started dissecting bags, I wanted to show that price really wasn't about the leather or the materials used -- that it was mostly about the status associated with a label. So many people automatically assume that if it's expensive, it must be good.
What was the first bag you ever cut up?
It was a Louis Vuitton briefcase. Louis Vuitton is one of the most famous leather brands in the world, but many people don't know that the iconic LV monogram material is actually canvas. The first video that went viral was a little $ 1,200 wallet from Chanel. From then on, requests to feature different brands have been rolling in nonstop.
What are you looking for when you slash a bag?
The leather quality, of course. How it has been tanned. I use acetone to remove the finish, and I can see how much plastic makeup has been applied to the leather. I burn the leather to assess what tanning process has been used. Then I look at the craftsmanship, which is reflected in the stitching, hardware and construction.
A big part of what I do is assessing the brand's claims. A bag might look good from the outside, but when you rip it open and look inside, it tells another story.
Who are the almost two million followers you have on social media?
There is definitely a demographic who hate luxury brands, full stop, who think the pricing is a scam and that people who pay for them are stupid. Then there are people who just love the entertainment value of chopping up expensive products. But many people are watching the videos because they love luxury and want a better understanding of quality products. They want to assess their luxury or vintage purchases with their eyes open.
Which brands are worth the money?
Bottega Veneta uses incredible leathers, and I've done three or four videos on their beautiful products. Though in one video -- on a $ 650 wallet -- I cut it up, and the lining was made from a lower quality leather than the one described on the label. (Bottega did not respond to a request for comment).
I really like a Scottish label called Strathberry. They make their products in Ubrique, which is this small town in Spain where brands like Loewe and Dior make their goods. But Strathberry is a fraction of the cost -- more like $ 500 instead of $ 3,000. Polene is another great label made by people who really know what they are doing. Coach is pretty good at a mid-price point.
Are you ever shocked by what you find?
I don't get positively shocked -- I'm paying a lot of money. Great if we can show a bag to be great material and design, but that should be the standard.
Do brands reach out to you now?
Not really, and especially not from the luxury space. I don't accept free items or advertising opportunities. People will trust me only if I stay totally independent.
Lots of people will have given or received leather goods during the holidays. Any tips for them?
Trust your senses. Feel it. If it feels plasticky, that's not a good sign. Smell it. There isn't only one leather smell, but there is a pleasant, slightly earthy aroma to quality leather. It should not smell like chemicals.
Look at it. Leather is an animal-sourced product. It has variations to its grain and fiber structure. The more variations you see in the fabric, the more natural and untreated it is. If it's overdone with a heavy finish, leather becomes very standardized and lower quality hides can be hidden.

12 Key Music Collections, From Future to the Who: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Whitney Houston's gospel music, Future's prolific mixtape run, a chunk of Joni Mitchell's archives and a soundtrack of Brooklyn's early discos arrived in new packages this year.
Artists were eager to revisit the past in 2023 -- some tweaking recent albums (like Taylor Swift), others revisiting long-dormant work in the vaults (like the two surviving Beatles). Boxed sets and reissue collections serve a different purpose, helping put catalogs and musicians into context, and bringing fresh revelations to light. Here are a dozen of the best our critics encountered this year.
Julee Cruise, 'Floating Into the Night'
(Sacred Bones; one LP, $ 22)
The absorbing, unconventional debut album from the deep-exhale vocalist Julee Cruise, who died in 2022, was produced by Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch; the three had previously collaborated on music for Lynch's 1986 alt-noir film "Blue Velvet." This batch of songs, released in 1989, plays as an extension of that fun-house mirror, lightly terrifying universe, with twisted 1950s melodies meeting destabilizing, plangent guitars meeting Dali-esque shimmers. "Falling" became the theme song for "Twin Peaks" in instrumental form, but its full vocal version is the essential one. Songs like that, "The Nightingale" and "Into the Night" feel, even now, sui generis -- not exactly dream-pop or new age, but something utterly amniotic. And lightly harrowing, too. JON CARAMANICA
DeYarmond Edison, 'Epoch'
(Jagjaguwar; five LPs, four CDs, 120-page book, $ 130)
Bon Iver didn't come out of nowhere. Before he started that project, Justin Vernon was in DeYarmond Edison, a pensive, folky but exploratory band that made two albums before splitting up; other members formed Megafaun. DeYarmond Edison -- Vernon's middle names -- delved into folk, rock, Minimalism and bluegrass, learning traditional songs but also experimenting with phase patterns. It made two studio albums and left behind other songs, including "Epoch." This extensively annotated boxed set includes songs from Mount Vernon, DeYarmond Edison's jammy predecessor, along with DeYarmond Edison's full second studio album (though only part of its first), unreleased demos, intimate concerts, collaborations outside the band and Vernon's 2006 solo recordings. It's a chronicle that opens up the sources of a style getting forged. JON PARELES
Future, 'Monster,' 'Beast Mode' and '56 Nights'
(Epic; one LP each, $ 21.98)
During six months in the mid-2010s, the Atlanta hip-hop escapist Future remade himself during a daring and powerful three-mixtape run. He'd come into this stretch flirting with pop acclaim, but emerged something like a folk hero. There are some true hits on these releases, including the narcoleptic, charming "Codeine Crazy" and the ecstatic yelp "March Madness." But lesser-heard songs like the howling "No Compadre," the melancholic "Where I Came From" and the antic "Wesley Presley" are almost as effective. And Future's sheer volume of recording, leaning on producers like Zaytoven and Southside, showed the versatility and relentlessness that still makes him a star almost a decade later. The quirky persistence of physical media -- as decoration and historical codification and perhaps even as music delivery vehicle -- means that mixtapes, when they're important enough, end up getting hard-pressed into vinyl. So for the first time, these mixtapes (or slightly streamlined versions of them, alas) are officially available for physical collections, not just virtual ones. CARAMANICA
Nanci Griffith, 'Working in Corners'
(Craft Recordings; four CDs, $ 55; four LPs, $ 125)
The Texas-born singer-songwriter Nanci Griffith, who died in 2021 at age 68, sometimes called her music "folkabilly" -- a fitting description for a sound that blended reverent traditionalism with honky-tonk sweat. Though beloved by a devoted cult audience, Griffith mostly flew under the radar of the mainstream, so the recently released boxed set "Working in Corners" provides a welcome opportunity to reassess her legacy. Included here are Griffith's first four albums, some of which have long been out of print, along with liner notes that put them in their proper context. Stretching from 1978, when Griffith was a budding folk revivalist with a penchant for sparse arrangements, to 1986, when she had blossomed into a confident country bandleader with a short-story-writer's eye for evocative detail, "Working in Corners" charts the steady development of Griffith's resounding talent.

Whitney Houston, 'I Go to the Rock: The Gospel Music of Whitney Houston'
(Gaither Music Group/Arista/Legacy Recordings; CD, $ 13.99; DVD, $ 19.99; both $ 29.95)
"Do you like gospel music?" Whitney Houston asked an audience at the Yokohama Arena in Japan in January 1990, before launching into an ecstatic six-minute medley of the devotional standards "He" and "I Believe." This live recording is one of the six previously unreleased tracks featured on "I Go to the Rock," a career-spanning compilation that centers Houston's lifelong connection to gospel music. (A concurrently released DVD provides additional commentary.) The set features several familiar tracks from the 1996 soundtrack of "The Preacher's Wife" -- still the best-selling gospel album of all time -- and two never-before-released performances from Houston's 1995 "VH1 Honors" concert, including a rousing duet of "Bridge Over Troubled Water" with CeCe Winans. But the album's most precious gem is "Testimony," an upbeat, foot-stomping song Houston recorded in 1981, when she was just 17. Her voice, fascinatingly, was still unformed compared to the immaculate instrument she'd soon learn how to command, but, as ever, it was alive with passion and spirit. ZOLADZ
Joni Mitchell, 'Archives, Vol. 3: The Asylum Years (1972-1975)'
(Rhino; five CDs, $ 69.98; four LPS, $ 99.98)
For Joni Mitchell, the period from 1972 and 1975 was a time of personal transformation and creative metamorphosis. The three exquisite, wildly different studio albums she released in that era -- the solitary meditation "For the Roses," the lively and openhearted "Court and Spark," the searchingly experimental "Hissing of Summer Lawns" -- tell the broad arc of the story, but this crucial and expansive boxed set fills in the details. Highlights include jam sessions with James Taylor and Neil Young (whose weeping guitar licks and harmonica turn the playful "You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio" into something else entirely); a crystalline 1972 Carnegie Hall show and a more rollicking 1974 set at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles; and early demos of future Mitchell classics like "Help Me," "Lesson in Survival" and "The Jungle Line." Across nearly six hours of chronologically arranged material, Mitchell's music steadily cuts its own winding path from poetic folk toward pop-minded jazz, anticipating her late-70s work with Wayne Shorter, Jaco Pastorius and Charles Mingus. These years represent rapid growth, and this set provides an intimate look at Mitchell's process -- a rare opportunity to listen in as she perfects some of her most daring and enduring work. ZOLADZ
Chalino Sánchez, '15 Éxitos 15'
(Musart/Craft; two LPs, $ 50)
Chalino Sánchez was a singer of narcocorridos -- tales of the drug trade -- and also of deeply romantic and anguished ballads. He was killed in 1992 at age 31, and for all his success during his lifetime, death amplified his legend, ensuring that his elegantly sung songs and take-no-guff persona became a crucial part of the foundation for the Mexican and Mexican American music that arrived in his wake. In spirit, and sometimes in sound, Sánchez is one of the key precursors to the corridos tumbados movement that's currently taking traditional Mexican music worldwide. This is the first time this anthology of songs recorded throughout his career -- originally released in 1995, three years after Sánchez was killed -- has appeared on vinyl, in an exclusive from Vinyl Me, Please. It is a blistering showcase of his wide and expressive voice, whether on the deeply sad "Nieves de Enero" and "Alma Enamorada," or on the pride-filled tribute "A Todo Sinaloa." CARAMANICA
Various Artists, 'The Memphis Blues Box: Original Recordings First Released on 78s and 45s, 1914-1969'
(Bear Family; 20 CDs and 360-page hardcover book, $ 283)
This monumental collection -- 534 well-chosen songs with an encyclopedic book -- covers more than half a century of blues recorded in Memphis, with performers both well-known (B.B. King, Furry Lewis, Memphis Minnie, Elvis Presley, Ike and Tina Turner) and barely remembered. There were some constants through the decades: songs about loving, cheating, drinking, hard work and hard times. But the set also chronicles a genre solidifying and defining itself, as the variety of the 1920s and 1930s -- with jug bands, string bands, jazz combos, barrelhouse piano, kazoos and clarinets -- narrows into guitar-centered 12-bar shuffles and boogies, all sung with striking voices and wry resilience. PARELES
Various Artists, 'Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night: Brooklyn Disco 1974-5'
(Ace; one CD, $ 15; two LPs, $ 34)
Tony Manero would have never sashayed his way through Bay Ridge in "Saturday Night Fever" without the highly theatrical, occasionally lurid 1976 New York magazine article, written by Nik Cohn, about the emergent proto-disco nightclubs in Brooklyn. This compilation (which shares its name with that article) is an approximation of what was playing in those outer-borough rooms -- highly sensual, up-tempo soul music pulsing with lustrous string sections and singing that blended ache with pride. "After You've Had Your Fling (Get Down to the Real Thing)," by the Intrepids, begins as a taunt and ends in a pool of ecstasy. "Wake Up Everybody," by Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, is dynamic but not quite explosive, regal but not quite rocking. In total, these songs capture a moment before the disco sound coalesced into something shimmery and a touch saccharine, underscoring its foundation as thrilling, swelling music to sweat to. (Brief excerpts from Cohn's article are sprinkled throughout the liner notes, but a full reprint would have been welcome, even though the copy concedes the piece "was sold as fact but was fictional.") CARAMANICA
Various Artists, 'Written in Their Soul: The Stax Songwriter Demos'
(Craft; seven CDs, $ 90; digital download, $ 70)
Songs have to start somewhere. East/Memphis Music, the publishing arm of Stax Records, kept copies of hundreds of demos from the 1960s and 1970s: solo home recordings and tracks roughed out with Stax studio stalwarts, hi-fi and lo-fi, chosen to become singles or left on the shelf. This set gathers 146 of them: some that clearly mapped the finished versions, some that would be recast and some that hold tantalizing unrealized possibilities. It's a chance to hear the voices of songwriters who largely stayed behind the scenes, like Bettye Crutcher, Homer Banks and Mack Rice. It's also a tribute to the Stax studio teamwork that would go on to punch up these demos into finished songs. PARELES
War, 'The World Is a Ghetto: 50th Anniversary Collector's Edition -- The Complete Sessions'
(Rhino; five LPs, $ 125)
The long-running Los Angeles band War came up with hybrid grooves -- funk-Latin-blues-rock-gospel-reggae-soul -- that sounded as casual as block-party jam sessions. But they weren't. War's 1972 album, "The World Is a Ghetto," went to No. 1 with hits built on those grooves, including "Low Rider" and "The Cisco Kid." The expanded reissue includes an LP of outtakes and, for each of its six songs, a 25-minute montage of session material. The songs take shape as the band chooses sounds, toys with riffs and rhythms, reworks lyrics and tightens up every syncopation; they're jovial, but they're doing the work. PARELES
The Who, 'Who's Next/Life House'
(Geffen; 10 CDs, 1 Blu-ray audio, 100-page hardcover book, $ 300)
Pete Townshend had vast ambitions for the Who's studio follow-up to the rock opera "Tommy," but cooler heads prevailed and it was cut back to a concept-free single album: "Who's Next," a pinnacle of the band's career. In 1970, long before the internet, Townshend envisioned "Life House" as a high-tech parable about ecological disaster, tyranny, virtual entertainment and the healing communal power of live rock music, which he wanted to generate with crowdsourced information from concert workshops. He also leaped into early synthesizer technology. Townshend never quite let go of "Life House"; he has released parts of it on solo collections, and this year he also collaborated on turning its story into a graphic novel. This exhaustive boxed set unites "Who's Next" with the whole painstaking process before it: demos, instrumentals, discarded songs with elements that would resurface elsewhere, variations and ferocious live workshop concerts at small theaters, along with spatialized Blu-ray remixes. It's a deep dive into Townshend's intense, convoluted creative efforts. The extended instrumental versions of the electronics-driven "Baba O'Riley" are spectacular; so is the live, muscular and metaphysical "Time Is Passing." PARELES

Pope.L, 68, Artist Who Took a Stand By Crawling, Is Dead: [Biography]

Author: Heinrich, Will

Publication info: Heinrich, Will. 

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/pope-l-68-artist-who-took-stand-crawling-is-dead/docview/2907646252/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He is best known for crawling along the entirety of Broadway in Manhattan wearing a Superman costume, a work that blended satire and resistance.
Pope.L, an uncompromising conceptual and performance artist who explored themes of race, class and what he called "have-not-ness," and who was best known for crawling the length of Broadway in a Superman costume, died on Saturday at his home in Chicago. He was 68.
The death was confirmed by his gallery, Mitchell-Innes & Nash. No cause was given.
By 2001, when he began "The Great White Way: 22 Miles, 9 Years, 1 Street, Broadway, New York," as the performance was ultimately titled, Pope.L was already well known in the art world for a career that comprised every medium from writing to photography, from painting to sculpture, and from performance to straight theater.
His abiding themes were the intersecting difficulties and distinctions that he experienced as a Black American and a son of the working class. But the impact of his work came less from the literal sense of its surface contents, which could be difficult to decode, than from its sheer intensity, and from his willingness to say and do things others wouldn't. Especially when performing, he used his own bodily presence to shock viewers back into their own.
His first "crawl," as he called them, took place in Times Square in 1978, when he moved on his belly across 42nd Street in a pinstriped suit with a yellow square sewed to the back. Getting horizontal in a relentlessly vertical city was a simple gesture that punctured most of the collective delusions that made that city run, at once lampooning and rejecting the pose of an upright citizen. It dramatized, with a potent mixture of satire and resistance, the experience of subjection particular to Black Americans. And the incongruity of a man in business attire sprawled out on the sidewalk drew attention to the homeless and disenfranchised people the average upright citizen habitually ignored.
The same year, in SoHo, he performed "Thunderbird Immolation a.k.a. Meditation Square Piece" in front of the building where the influential dealers Leo Castelli and Ileana Sonnabend had their galleries. Sitting cross-legged on another square yellow cloth, surrounded by a circle of loose matches, Pope.L evoked the Buddhist monks who had famously immolated themselves in Vietnam by pouring alcohol and Coca-Cola over his head, using a fortified wine heavily marketed in poor Black neighborhoods. Provocative, ambitious and more than a little funny, it was emblematic of his practice. (When someone came out of the building to complain, he politely gathered his things and left.)
"Today people often want art to have a clear and even redemptive political message, but Pope.L gave us neither," Scott Rothkopf, director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, said in an interview. "He had a brilliant capacity to distill difficult, even horrifying truths about American society into strange and challenging work. It can be truculent, or funny, or both, but it's never easy."
In a 2019 video interview for the Museum of Modern Art, which acquired a number of his early performance works ahead of "member," his retrospective that year, Pope.L spoke about creating another crawl in Tompkins Square Park in 1991. "I had been writing a lot," he said. "I mean, that's all I did. I was sort of getting written out, and I needed to find a more direct way of making things happen culturally."
What he encountered, the critic C. Carr wrote in an essay included in the 2002 book "William Pope.L: The Friendliest Black Artist in America," was another Black man, a local, who rushed over to ask if he was all right; to upbraid the white cameraman hired to document the performance; and finally to exclaim, in tears, "I wear a suit like that to work!"
For "The Great White Way," which he began in 2001 and continued through 2009, Pope.L crawled the length of Broadway, from New York Harbor to the Bronx, in segments as short as just a few blocks, depending on what his elbows and knees could take. He wore a Superman costume, minus the cape; gardening gloves; and a skateboard tied to his back.
Among a broad range of other performances that the curator Valerie Cassel Oliver, writing in the catalog for "member," called "existential spectacles of absurd anxiety," Pope.L ate pieces of The Wall Street Journal while sitting on a toilet; covered himself in flour, mayonnaise, milk and other white substances; marshaled volunteers to pull an eight-ton truck by hand through Cleveland; and had another mordant jab -- "the friendliest Black artist in America" -- copyrighted. He was also a longtime teacher at Bates College in Maine and for the last dozen years taught in the visual arts department of the University of Chicago.
The 2019 MoMA show, which presented documentation and materials connected to 13 early performances, was one of a trio of concurrent shows. There was also a new installation at the Whitney and "Conquest," sponsored by the Public Art Fund, a lineup of 140 volunteers who crawled from Greenwich Village to Union Square.
"From its very earliest beginnings," Pope.L told Interview magazine in 2013, "the crawl project was conceived as a group performance. Unfortunately for me, at that time, I was the only volunteer."
Earlier this year, Pope.L built an impossible-to-enter white room in the middle of the 52 Walker gallery in Manhattan, as part of "Impossible Failures," a show that also included work by the artist Gordon Matta-Clark. A current show, "Hospital," at the South London Gallery in London through Feb. 11, centers on a group of collapsing white towers. A toilet atop the middle tower looks back to Pope.L's act of eating pieces of The Wall Street Journal.
"In the course of two hours at an opening," his gallerist, Lucy Mitchell-Innes, said, "he came up with what he wanted to do, and then it sort of transmogrified into this incredible new piece. It did what he always does, which is give it relevance for today. It became a metaphor for collapsing social structures: the collapsing economy, the collapsing international politics, the collapsing of the rich world and the poor world. You thought of all those things when you looked at it."
Pope.L was born William Pope on June 28, 1955, in Newark to Lucille Lancaster and William Pope. He spent part of what he remembered as an unstable childhood in Keyport, N.J., and part of it in the East Village with his grandmother Desma Lancaster, an artist who showed quilt pieces at the Studio Museum in Harlem in the 1960s.
He is survived by his partner, Mami Takahashi; an older brother, Eugene Pope; and a son, Desmond Tarkowski-Pope.L.
According to Ms. Mitchell-Innes, "Pope.L," a portmanteau of the artist's original surname and his mother's, was coined by his students at Bates College in the mid-1980s. He adopted it and went by "William Pope.L" for nearly three decades before dropping the "William."
Pope.L studied at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and earned a bachelor's degree at Montclair State College (now Montclair State University) in New Jersey in 1978. He also studied at the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program, the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University and the Mabou Mines theater on St. Mark's Place in Manhattan, which the playwright Lee Breuer described as teaching "a no man's land between experimental theater and performance art."
Jessica Stockholder, a fellow professor at the University of Chicago, described Pope.L as a deeply committed and effective teacher.
"He was wide open to all different kinds of people," she said by phone, "and very empathetic and concerned about people's well-being."
Ebony Haynes, who curated "Impossible Failures," concurred.
"He has this way of listening to everybody," she said. "He gave you the floor -- without even knowing you, he knew that in the very least you, and everyone, deserves to be heard."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Neri Diaz thought he was ready for a crucial juncture in California's ambitious plans, closely watched in other states and around the world, to phase out diesel-powered trucks.
His company, Harbor Pride Logistics, acquired 14 electric trucks this year to work alongside 32 diesel vehicles, in anticipation of a rule that says diesel rigs can no longer be added to the list of vehicles approved to move goods in and out of California's ports. But in August the manufacturer of Mr. Diaz's electric vehicles, Nikola, took back the trucks as part of a recall, saying it would return them in the first quarter of the new year.
"It's a brand-new technology, first generation, so I knew things were going to happen, but I wasn't expecting all my 14 trucks to be taken back," he said. "It is a big impact on my operations."
The rule was to take effect at the start of the new year, but California's Air Resources Board said on Thursday that it would not begin enforcement until it had received approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Trucking, an outsize source of carbon emissions, is where California's green revolution is meeting some of its biggest challenges. Electric trucks, with their huge batteries, can cost over $ 400,000, and they can't do long hauls without stopping for long charging periods, which can undermine the economics of a trucking fleet.
But California sees the port trucks as an opportunity to take a big step forward.
The electric trucks on the market today can travel from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach -- the nation's busiest hub for container cargo -- to many of the warehouses inland without stopping to charge. And cleaning up the port trucks could have a big impact. With some 30,000 trucks registered with the ports, introducing green vehicles could lead to a substantial decrease in carbon emissions and the particulates that can cause illnesses in the communities through which the trucks travel.
Nancy Gonzalez and her 25-year-old son, Juan, who has Down syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis, live in the Wilmington neighborhood, just north of the ports. Huge rigs going to and from nearby truck yards roar constantly a few feet from the house.
The truck traffic got much heavier about four years ago, Ms. Gonzalez said, and now she cleans twice a day to get rid of the dirt it produces. Ms. Gonzalez says that she has problems with her sinuses and that her son's eyes started tearing about two years ago.
"Nobody opens their windows," she said in Spanish through an interpreter. "Nobody."
California hopes that its stringent rules combined with financial support -- truck purchase grants from state agencies can total as much as $ 288,000 per vehicle, operators say -- will help spur truckers, automakers, warehouse landlords, utilities and charging companies to make the investments needed to create a carbon-free port truck sector by 2035, when all diesel trucks will be banned from the ports. And success at the ports could help the state meet its goal of decarbonizing all types of trucking over the next two decades, and be a model for similar efforts in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington.
"In the long run, I am quite confident we can decarbonize the heavy-duty truck sector," said James Sallee, a professor in the department of agriculture and resource economics at the University of California, Berkeley, referring to California's plan. "But I don't know that the industry is ready to overcome the various barriers to rapid deployment."
The port fleets have barely started the transformation.
In November, 180 electric trucks, a mere 1 percent of the total, were registered to operate at the Port of Los Angeles. There was a single truck powered by hydrogen fuel cells, the other technology used to power big rigs.
Some truck operators say they have stockpiled diesel trucks and registered them with the ports ahead of the new rule, though this does not show up in port statistics. In November, there were 20,083 diesel trucks with access to the Los Angeles port, down from 21,310 a year earlier.
Large companies, with deep pockets and big facilities, are best positioned to make the green transition. Mike Gallagher, a California-based executive at Maersk, the Danish shipping giant, said the company had a fully electric fleet, comprising some 85 vehicles made by Volvo and BYD, the Chinese automaker, for transporting goods up to 50 miles out of the ports of Southern California. And it has worked with landlords to install scores of chargers at its depots.
"We're well ahead of the curve," he said.
But smaller trucking fleets do most of the port runs -- accounting for some 70 percent at the Los Angeles port -- and they are going to find the transition hard. The California Trucking Association has filed a federal lawsuit against the state's trucking rules, including the one focused on port trucks, contending that they represent "a vast overreach that threatens the security and predictability of the nation's goods movement industry."
Matt Schrap, the chief executive of the Harbor Trucking Association, another trade group, said the port truck rules lacked exemptions that would help smaller businesses survive the transformation. Getting access to chargers is particularly difficult for smaller fleets, he said: They are expensive, and the truck yard landlords may be reluctant to install them, forcing the operators to rely on a public charging system that is only just getting built.
"The landlord is, like, 'There's not a snowball's chance in Bakersfield that you're going to tear up my parking lot to put in some heavy-duty charging,"' Mr. Schrap said.
Concern exists beyond the trade groups. Mr. Gallagher, the Maersk executive, said that if the clean truck rules caused serious problems for smaller operators, it could be "a significant disruption to the supply chain."
Forum Mobility is one of several companies that believe they can help the smaller fleets, by building public truck charging stations and leasing electric trucks. The company has secured permits to build a depot at the Long Beach port, expected to open next year, that can charge 44 trucks. The depot will run on nine megawatts of electricity, enough to power most sports stadiums, but Forum Mobility executives say that charging all the port trucks would require roughly the amount of power produced by Diablo Canyon, a California nuclear power station, and thousands of chargers.
"We need a real Manhattan Project on interconnection," said Adam Browning, executive vice president for policy at Forum Mobility.
Chanel Parson, director of building and transportation electrification at Southern California Edison, a large power utility, said building out the truck-charging infrastructure would be helped if state agencies streamlined the issuing of permits and accelerated spending approvals, and if trucking companies communicated their charging needs.
But she added that her company was undaunted by the task. "There's not this concern that this is really difficult," she said. "It's what we do."
Mr. Diaz, the operator whose Nikola trucks were recalled, said that charging the trucks cost roughly 40 percent less than diesel, and that he was impressed with their performance. Even with the help of state grants, he estimates that the electric trucks cost him as much as 50 percent more than diesel models. During the recall, Nikola has been covering the payments on the loans Mr. Diaz took out to buy the trucks, but he said he was concerned about the truck maker's financial situation.
Steve Girsky, Nikola's chief executive, said a new infusion of capital in December showed that investors believed in the company. "This will get us a long way," he said in an interview. "Everything this company's talked about is coming together in the fourth quarter."
Some trucking executives say not only that they are used to responding to California's ratcheting up of regulations over the years, but also that they believe in the environmental goals of the port truck transition.
Rudy Diaz, president of Hight Logistics, said the new regulations had pushed up some of his costs as his company brought drivers onto its payroll and reduced its reliance on contract drivers using their own diesel trucks.
"It's extra headaches, extra costs," he said. "But consumers are asking for products that are more sustainable, and they're willing to pay the price."

Why She Still Loves Waikiki's 'Blue Hawaii': [Travel Desk]

Full text: It's fashionable to look down on the famous Honolulu beach as touristy and inauthentic. But you can still find the tropical paradise that inspired dreams of the islands, if you know where to look.
Since my first trip to Waikiki Beach in 1977, I have traveled all around the Hawaiian Islands. And I've loved each one. But I love Waikiki, too.
Not the hordes of tourists, of course, or the high-end shopping malls that have taken over Kalākaua Avenue and earned it the nickname, Vegas on the Beach. What I love are the remnants of a different Waikiki, a beautiful, tropical paradise that inspired songs and movies and dreams and romance. When I come here, with some time and patience, I can still find that Waikiki.
Lately, it's become fashionable to dismiss Waikiki as a playland for tourists and not the "real" Hawaii. When I posted pictures of a gorgeous sunset and the waves crashing on Waikiki Beach on social media last March, I got vehement comments like: "Get out of there and see the real Hawaii!"
And: "Here's where you should be ..."
And: "Ugh. Waikiki."
But Waikiki is no less the real Hawaii than anywhere else, said T. Ilihia Gionson, the public affairs officer for the Hawaii Tourism Authority. "From the beginning, Waikiki has been a very special place that captured the hearts and souls of many," he said. "The land is the land, and it will always have that certain energy and life force that comes through, no matter what we put upon it."
According to Mr. Gionson, in prepandemic 2019, Hawaii had 10.4 million annual arrivals, its highest number ever. Numbers this year are running at about 92 percent of that number, or close to 10 million arrivals. The strain of so many visitors on local neighborhoods led the Hawaiian Tourism Authority to ask themselves how they can do tourism better and reinvest economic resources into communities and resources. With its emphasis on local culture, traditions and products, the Mālama Hawaii campaign, which kicked off in 2021, invites travelers to learn how Hawaiians care for their home.
Waikiki, once home to royalty, was an agricultural center, rich with taro fields and rice paddies, and eventually became a seaside neighborhood for local families. The Māhele, a land distribution plan that changed the islands' communal system of land ownership to a private one in 1848, brought western land barons and the beginning of tourism with hotels built for wealthy tourists.
With the opening of the luxurious Moana Surfrider in 1901, Waikiki's reputation as a popular tourist destination began. Promoters advertised many of the things that are still synonymous with Waikiki today -- lū'aus, lush leis, and the beach boys who taught water sports. Wealthy businessmen watched crowds emerge from boats onto Waikiki Beach after a six-and-a-half day trip from San Francisco and saw an opportunity to develop these wetlands into a tourist mecca. The Waikiki Reclamation Project drained and dredged Ala Wai Canal and its surrounding fish ponds, taro fields, rice farms and banana and coconut groves, then filled them with material upon which to build hundreds of acres of new hotels and upscale homes.
Old Waikiki was gone -- again -- and a new Waikiki of luxury hotels and tiki bars emerged. Movies like "Blue Hawaii," starring Elvis Presley, and singers like Don Ho brought Hawaii into our living rooms. This was the Waikiki I arrived in on a United Airlines Friend Ship, one of 3 million tourists who visited in 1977. As my friends and I disembarked from our flight, where stewardesses in flowered uniforms served us mai tais and macadamia-crusted chicken, saronged women placed plumeria leis around our necks and welcomed us with that magical word, "Aloha."
Unable to afford a beachfront hotel, we stayed at the Miramar, four blocks from the ocean. But we didn't care -- we were in Waikiki. We bought tatami mats and Hawaiian Tropic suntan lotion at the ABC store and happily walked across the street, through the lobby of a hotel and onto the beach. There was Diamond Head, and surfers and the Pacific Ocean, everything we had hoped for.
When we weren't sunbathing, we roamed around the International Marketplace, the outdoor market that Don the Beachcomber, the father of tiki culture, opened in 1956, the year we were born. Around the 60-foot-tall banyan tree in the center were kiosks that sold all things tropical and Hawaiian. Jane paid $ 10 for the chance to find an oyster with a pearl inside. I bought my mother a handwoven grass skirt. Why I thought a middle-aged accountant in West Warwick, R.I., would want a grass skirt, I can't say. Except that I was bringing Hawaii, a place she would never visit, 5,000 miles to her.
At night, we ate teriyaki sirloins at Chuck's Cellar and drank overly sweet mai tais at beach bars. In the morning, we ordered all-you-can-eat pancakes at Wailana Coffee House, tucked our tatami mats under our arms, and started all over again.
The Miramar Hotel, Chuck's Cellar, and the Wailana Coffee House are all gone now. The International Marketplace was completely razed in 2013 and reopened three years later with only the name and the banyan tree remaining. Today, instead of the dangling vines and footbridges, the International Marketplace is a three-story mall with a Burberry shop and a Christian Louboutin.
In many ways, what happened to the International Marketplace represents what has happened to create this newest Waikiki. With an influx of international tourists in the 1990s, high-end retail shops arrived along with more hotels. The well-known San Francisco department store Gump's, which opened at the corner of Kalākaua Avenue and Lewers Street in 1929, became a Louis Vuitton store in 1992. Thirteen years later, buildings were bulldozed or repurposed to create Luxury Row with stores like Chanel and Gucci.
When I asked the Island-born chef and restaurateur, Ed Kenney, where I could find old Waikiki, his first response was that unfortunately, that Waikiki has been all but lost. Then he gave me recommendations of where to find it.
One way to get there is to walk through a different mall, past the Wolfgang Puck steakhouse and the word Aloha surrounded by lights, until you see a flash of pink through the trees. Follow that pink through a wrought-iron gate into an oasis of grass and trees and the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, called the Pink Palace of the Pacific when it opened in 1927. Immediately, the crowds and noise disappear. Minutes after you check in, you will be under a pink-and-white striped beach umbrella, your toes in white sand. Wander over to the bar for a mai tai, commissioned as a special cocktail for this very hotel and created by Victor Bergeron in 1953, and it is like being back in time.
At sunset, I like to go to the restaurant House Without a Key to sip a pretty pink Table 97 cocktail while the Kapalama Trio sings softly beneath a 136-year-old kiawe tree and the sky turns pink and lavender. The cocktail is named for Ernest Hemingway and Martha Gellhorn's favorite table when they honeymooned here in 1940, and the restaurant is named for the 1925 novel, "The House Without a Key," by Earl Derr Biggers, which was the first of a mystery series featuring a fictional Honolulu detective named Charlie Chan. An original copy is on display at the entrance.
It is also worth it to brave the throngs and take a walk down Kalākaua Avenue, past some of the remaining old significant Waikiki architecture. Although most of the iconic buildings were torn down, a surprising number of hidden gems with tropical-motif latticework railings and building decorations remain. Start at the Waikiki Galleria Tower at 2222 Kalākaua Avenue, built in 1966 by the architect George Wimberly, then continue around the corner for a 10-minute walk to see the breadfruit design on the wrought iron railings at the Kaiulani Court Apartments at 209 Kaiulani Avenue.
Nearby apartment buildings along Lau'ula Street have railings with surfboards, banana leaves and sails, as well as lava rock walls and cantilevered lanais. Even the new International Marketplace is worth a visit to see that old banyan tree and a replica of Don the Beachcomber's office with old photographs, menus and advertisements in a treehouse above it.
Skip the lines at the Cheesecake Factory and take a short Uber ride to the Highway Inn, open since 1947, for some lau lau and kalua pig with cabbage and a 25-cent side of raw onion with salt. Or try the Side Street Inn for fried rice, garlic fried chicken and sizzling short ribs. Or have an iconic plate lunch of loco moco, rice and macaroni salad at the Rainbow Drive-in, open since 1961 and affectionately called Rainbows by locals.
Except for the happy hour at the piano bar at the Moana Surfrider, where they make strong real cocktails like martinis and Manhattans, skip the Blue Hawaiis and sugary mai tais at hotel bars. Instead, walk down Saratoga Road, past the tattoo parlor and Eggs and Things (serving eggs with Portuguese sausage or pork chops since 1974) to Arnold's Beach Bar, a tiny bar that is actually not on the beach, but is full of regulars, like a Waikiki Cheers. If you're lucky, Brie Brundige will be behind the bar making Arnold's famous mai tais ( $ 10 here versus $ 21 or more in hotels) and will share the recipe.
One morning, I woke up early, got a kona coffee and a li hing mango morning bun from the Honolulu Café, and sat on Waikiki Beach. It was quiet and, except for some surfers in the water and a mother and daughter building sand castles, I was alone. The sky was pale pink. The palm trees swayed in the breeze. Diamond Head watched me sitting there. I was smiling, happy in Waikiki. It is still there, if you look hard enough.

Using Middlemen, Russia Evades Sanctions on Imported Technology: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine last year, engineers at Convex, a Russian telecommunications company, needed to find American equipment to transmit data to the country's feared intelligence service. But no gear was flowing in after Western nations imposed sweeping new trade limits on Russia.
Convex's employees soon found a solution.
While Cisco, a U.S. tech provider, had halted sales to Russia on March 3, 2022, Convex's engineers easily obtained the Cisco gear they needed through an obscure Russian e-commerce site called Nag, which had gotten around international trade restrictions by buying the American equipment through a web of suppliers in China.
Convex engineers then visited the offices of Russia's Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B., in Yekaterinburg to install the gear that would help categorize and send data to the authorities. "Coordinate with the F.S.B. the placement of the Cisco Catalyst WS-C4948E switch," a Convex engineer wrote on March 23, 2022, according to a company communications log obtained by The New York Times.
In the 22 months since the war in Ukraine began, Russia has largely continued getting the technology it needs to keep its economy running. After export restrictions and corporate bans initially led to trade disruptions, Russian suppliers found loopholes and cultivated workarounds. Almost no piece of commercial hardware -- including basic telecom equipment, surveillance gear, microchips for advanced computing and weapons systems, and drones -- has been too hard to get.
Russian authorities and companies have united to take advantage of cracks in the global response. They have tapped webs of intermediaries, including middlemen in China, and disguised their activity through shell companies, according to leaked Russian government emails, trade documents and records of online conversations between Russian engineers obtained by The Times.
They have also turned to countries that have staked out neutral positions in the conflict, such as Morocco and Turkey, and used their ports to receive goods from global tech manufacturing centers that are then placed on other ships headed toward Russia, a process known as transshipment. The prohibited tech products were then made available to buy from well-known suppliers and on easy-to-use e-commerce sites like Nag.
Flexibility has been paramount. In weekly emails, Russian trade officials shared tips on which ports would transfer goods, who would trade in rubles and where Russian-flagged ships could be repaired, the documents show. If one supplier stopped selling, they found another. If a shipping route was cut off, new ones took up the slack.
The documents offer a rare glimpse of a race in which Russian traders have reliably stayed one step ahead of U.S.-led efforts to cut them off. Their success shows how difficult it is to stop the global movement of commercial technology, raising questions about the effectiveness of Western trade restrictions and whether tech giants should better control the destinations of their products -- and if it is even possible to do so.
Cisco declined to comment. Convex did not respond to requests for comment.
Understaffed government investigators in the United States and Europe cannot keep pace with the often shadowy flow of goods, said Elina Ribakova, an economist who has studied sanctions evasion at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a U.S. think tank. Major tech companies, she added, must do more to cut off supplies to Russia.
"It's an endless Whac-a-Mole game," she said. "There should be alarm, particularly among the policymakers, that we have announced a lot of sanctions and may believe they are working but in reality they are not."
A Beautiful Friendship
As sanctions against Russia took effect last year, ProSoft, a Moscow-based electronics provider, experienced the fallout.
Officials at the company, which sells biometric surveillance equipment and tech for heavy industry and critical infrastructure, emailed the Russian government trade mission in Morocco for help, according to a message reviewed by The Times.
"Just a week ago, it was not difficult to ship them to us from American and European suppliers," a ProSoft executive wrote, referring to now-banned tech. Now "we run the risk of starting to reduce production (there are small reserves in the warehouse)."
A spreadsheet attached to the message listed hundreds of American, European and Japanese microchips and sensors that ProSoft needed.
At the time, Russia's economy was absorbing the initial effects of trade restrictions. The ruble tumbled, inflation and interest rates soared, Russian banks were cut off from large swaths of the global financial system and oligarchs sat helpless as their yachts were seized.
But the pain did not last as President Vladimir V. Putin remade Russia's economy. Russian officials and executives swiftly teamed up to find workarounds. Political loyalists profited as Western companies fled.
In Morocco, Russia's trade office, which looks after the country's economic interests overseas, also helped Russian companies regain their footing. After ProSoft reached out for help, trade officials jumped into action.
"We're in constant contact with the general director" of Morocco's state-run port of Tanger Med, one Russian official wrote in an April 2022 email. "In the event of ships entering under the Russian flag, there will be no problems with maintenance."
A spokeswoman for Tanger Med, which hugs the Strait of Gibraltar, said the port leased space to shipping companies and had "no information nor responsibility" about vessels moving through the complex. The port, which handles more than eight million containers annually connecting to 180 international ports, was "not aware" of shipped goods calling at Russian ports before or after being at Tanger Med, or maintenance of Russian ships being performed, she added.
By November 2022, Russian trade officials in Morocco were bragging that their "direct support" had turned the African country into an electronics transshipment hub. Goods from Taiwan, China and other manufacturing centers were offloaded at Tanger Med and then placed on other ships headed to Russia.
"Given the long-term nature of the cooperation with the Moroccan partner, the volume of supplies could amount to about $ 10 million per year," the trade officials wrote about their work for ProSoft.
ProSoft also maintained supplies of Western tech with the help of an obscure scrap metal company registered in Casablanca, Morocco. After the war began, the company, Invent Maroc, set up a new website and routed restricted technology through Morocco to Russia, including microchips from Texas Instruments, Intel and NXP, according to trade data. In 2022, the United States had limited the export of semiconductors made with American equipment or intellectual property to Russia.
Invent Maroc, run by a man named Alexander Trinz, had no prior history of international exports. Yet it sourced electronics from Costa Rica, Malaysia, Taiwan, China, Japan and Mexico, according to trade records.
In a call this month, Mr. Trinz said he had supplied technology to Russia in the past, but not since the war. "Before, we worked with Russia, but in this moment we can't," he said.
An analysis of ProSoft's offerings found nearly 300 products for sale that contain Intel chips, as well as components made by Nvidia and an A.I. optimized computer chip designed by Google. Although it is unclear how the imports were ultimately used, American chips have been found on Russian missiles and drones, according to weapons experts.
Nvidia, Intel and Google declined to comment. Texas Instruments said it opposed "the illicit diversion of our products to Russia." ProSoft, NXP and Russia's trade representative to Morocco did not respond to requests for comment.
In October 2022, Russian trade officials said they had established 20 operators at the Tanger Med port to "promptly carry out" the logistics of getting cargo loaded onto "feeder" vessels ultimately bound for Russia, according to a weekly shipping report. Another report noted that ports in Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, had accepted payment in rubles.
"The sanctions restrictions have been successfully overcome," one government report said of a Turkish trade route this March.
Click and Buy
On little-known Russian e-commerce sites like Nag, OCS Distribution, 3Logic Distribution and 4Telecom, complex technologies made by major American and European telecom manufacturers, such as Cisco, HP, Juniper, Ericsson and Nokia, are listed for sale.
Many of these sites freely sold Western technology for decades, but overhauled their supply chains because of the war. Since then, the platforms have received hundreds of millions of dollars in technology from China, according to trade records.
China and Hong Kong supplied 85 percent of semiconductors imported to Russia from March 2022 to September 2023, up from 27 percent before the conflict, according to the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a nonprofit that studies Russian trade routes.
Nag, which sells hardware to regional telecoms and surveillance contractors, is one major platform. Through intermediaries, it has bought roughly $ 100 million in restricted American tech since the war began, according to trade data. In total, it imported $ 150 million in hardware from China this year, the data show. Communications gear, which has ostensibly been prohibited from reaching Russia, is readily available on its site, filtered by price, product type and quantity.
Nag employees have talked about logistical challenges that international sanctions have caused, according to internal communications. In May 2022, a Nag employee wrote to a Russian customer that "the old transit system has ended," delaying delivery of $ 20,000 of Juniper equipment. A month later, Nag followed up to say that the problem had been resolved and that the gear would arrive in the coming months.
Tech for building online surveillance and censorship was also available. Russian telecom operators are required by law to provide communications data about customers to the security services, meaning they must buy specialized equipment that sends the information to government agents. On Nag message boards, now accessible only from within Russia, engineers posted technical tips for making the systems work to F.S.B. specs.
Ericsson, Juniper, Nokia and IBM said any imports into Russia were done without their consent. OCS Distribution said that it "does not sell products in violation of international sanctions and restrictions" and that any such tech listed on its website for purchase was there because it was in the midst of an overhaul. HP, 3Logic Distribution and 4Telecom did not respond to requests for comment.
A network of Nag-operated companies and brands in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and the United Arab Emirates has also helped obscure shipments of sanctioned technology. In total, Nag brought in almost $ 10 million in Cisco equipment and about $ 1 million in Nokia and Intel products to Russia over the past year.
At the F.S.B. offices in Yekaterinburg, the Cisco gear that Convex engineers installed sat alongside routers made by Juniper, according to Convex's records. Less than a year later, the availability of Western tech was so abundant that Convex's engineers could shop around.
In a conversation on Convex's internal messaging system this year, engineers focused on a new supplier that they had "spotted." Operating under the name sale-server.ru, the supplier had plenty of restricted name-brand technology from HP, IBM and others. More important, the price was right.
"Cheaper than Nag," one Convex employee wrote.

How Putin Turned a Western Boycott Into a War Chest Bonanza: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: If companies want to leave Russia, the president is setting the terms -- in ways that benefit his government, his elites and his war.
Soon after Russian troops invaded his country, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, made a plea to Western companies: "Leave Russia," he said. "Make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny."
Hundreds of companies answered the call. Politicians and activists predicted that it would help strangle the Russian economy and undermine the Kremlin's war effort.
President Vladimir V. Putin had other plans.
Mr. Putin has turned the exits of major Western companies into a windfall for Russia's loyal elite and the state itself. He has forced companies wishing to sell to do so at fire-sale prices. He has limited sales to buyers anointed by Moscow. Sometimes he has seized firms outright.
A New York Times investigation traced how Mr. Putin has turned an expected misfortune into an enrichment scheme. Western companies that have announced departures have declared more than $ 103 billion in losses since the start of the war, according to a Times analysis of financial reports. Mr. Putin has squeezed companies for as much of that wealth as possible by dictating the terms of their departure.
He has also subjected those exits to ever-increasing taxes, generating at least $ 1.25 billion in the past year for Russia's war chest.
No private deal is safe. The Dutch beer company Heineken, for example, found a buyer this spring and set a price. But the Russian government unilaterally rejected the deal, people close to the negotiations said, and put the company's Russian holdings in the hands of an aerosol-packaging titan married to a former Russian senator.
In all, Mr. Putin has overseen one of the biggest transfers of wealth within Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Huge swaths of industries -- elevators, tires, industrial coatings and more -- are now in the hands of increasingly dominant Russian players.
In some cases, that player is the state. Government-owned enterprises have acquired the assets of corporate giants like Ikea and Toyota. In many cases, Mr. Putin personally signs off on sales.
"These are good deals for us, for sure," said Anton Pinsky, a prominent restaurateur who joined with a pro-Putin rapper and associates of a powerful senator to take over Starbucks. In an interview in Moscow, he downplayed the significance of his own deal but was clear about the effect of the Western departures.
"You screwed up, left it," he said. "We picked it up inexpensively. Thank you."
Today in Russia, a robust consumer world carries on, helping Mr. Putin maintain a sense of normalcy despite a war that has proved longer, deadlier and costlier than he predicted.
Most foreign companies remain in Russia, unwilling to lose the billions they've invested there over decades. Other businesses have been sold and now have a through-the-looking-glass feel. Krispy Kreme is now Krunchy Dream; its doughnuts come in a similar flat box with familiar flavors. Starbucks has been reborn as Stars Coffee. Its mermaid is now a Russian swan princess.
These companies can buy raw materials domestically or import them from friendly countries. And customers can still easily buy products that have supposedly been pulled from shelves. On a recent day, a Moscow supermarket offered Pepsi from Uzbekistan and Coca-Cola from Poland.
Mr. Putin's economic counterstrikes have helped to fortify support among the elites profiting from the war and to blunt the effects of Western isolation. While Ukraine is preoccupied with short-term imperatives like shoring up international support, the relative resilience of the Russian economy has enabled Mr. Putin to play a long game.
Previously undisclosed documents, financial statements and interviews with dozens of deal makers in Russia and across Europe -- many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution -- show that Moscow now micromanages practically every exit. Companies must navigate an opaque system to win approval to sell. In some cases, Mr. Putin's friends have appealed directly to him to intervene.
"Those who are leaving are losing their position," Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told The Times. "And of course, their property is being bought at a serious discount and taken over by our companies, which are doing it with pleasure."
Still, the wave of departing companies has stung. It has sent a global signal that Russia is a business pariah. The economy is strained and at risk of overheating. Mr. Putin's handling of Western departures has only reinforced Russia's image as a dangerous place to do business. Even some top Russian officials admit that decreased competition and foreign investment will hurt everyday Russians and the economy in the long term.
The Kremlin says it prefers that companies remain in Russia. But Mr. Putin scoffs at the notion that leaving will hurt. "Did they think everything would collapse here? Well, nothing of the kind happened," he said this month. "Russian companies took over and moved on."
Not every deal is a windfall. Some buyers will face steep obstacles to make their new businesses profitable.
Hanging over the exit process for Western firms is the threat of intimidation and force. The Russian authorities have investigated departing companies, interrogated workers and arrested local executives.
Last summer, Mr. Putin seized the Russian arm of the Danish brewer Carlsberg, along with roughly half a billion dollars in cash, and put them under the temporary control of one of his friends.
At least four other companies have similarly lost control of their operations this year to effective state seizures.
Today, Mr. Putin is at the helm of a fraught exit process that works to Russia's advantage. But it began in the early days of the war with the urgent goal of simply keeping the Russian economy alive.
Blocking the Exits
Speaking from the White House two weeks after the invasion, President Biden boasted that the West was crushing the Russian economy. "The list of businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing by the day," he said.
Things looked bleak for Mr. Putin. The stock exchange in Moscow was closed and the ruble had crashed. If Russia lost all the jobs, production and cash of Western companies, the effects would be devastating.
But Mr. Putin was preparing his financial rejoinder. He restricted the movement of money abroad and required that companies from "unfriendly nations" win approval before selling their businesses.
Mr. Putin was putting the brakes on just as Western executives faced pressure to accelerate. In the United States, there was perhaps no more vocal figure than the Yale University management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. He appeared on cable news programs, criticizing companies that remained in Russia.
Professor Sonnenfeld recalled that it was corporate boycotts -- more than sanctions -- that helped abolish apartheid in South Africa. He transformed his office into a sort of war room, with a Yale team grading companies on their efforts to sever Russian ties.
The question of who would end up with those companies was of little concern.
"If Putin thinks he can do better at the deep fryer, let him have at it," he said in an interview. "We really don't care. The important thing is to not have the endorsement of a renowned global brand."
Professor Sonnenfeld's list and others like it added to pressure from shareholders, Ukrainian activists and everyday consumers.
Some executives worried what would happen to their Russian employees, factories and technology if they walked away. Others were reluctant to abandon their investments over a war that might prove short-lived.
But some quickly announced intentions to go. Heineken and Carlsberg said that they would leave once they found buyers. The Canadian gold mining company Kinross did the same, and within days announced a deal for $ 680 million to sell its Russian operation to a local buyer.
OBI, a German hardware store chain, went a step further, saying that it would close all 27 stores in Russia until it found a buyer.
Mr. Putin's government, though, was already erecting hurdles.
On March 17, 2022, the Russian Trade Ministry sent a letter to local OBI managers. The letter, reviewed by The Times, urged managers to defy the company and keep the stores open, citing consumer-protection laws. There was no "economic reason" for closing, the ministry wrote.
OBI, the ministry warned, needed to fulfill "obligations to its consumers, workers and counterparties, including suppliers." That prompted a days-long cat-and-mouse game as local employees tried to reopen stores and executives in Germany tried to stop them.
The Russian authorities also demanded that OBI officials testify about their plans. Prosecutors visited a store and inspected its computer system, the company told The Times.
OBI struck a deal that spring, ultimately selling for the symbolic price of a few dollars.
The buyer, a businessman named Josef Liokumovich, passed the company's background checks and was not on any financial blacklists. But as OBI soon learned, Western companies have no control over who ultimately takes over their operations.
In less than a year, OBI's Russia operation changed owners four times, ultimately landing with associates of the Russian senator Arsen B. Kanokov, who is under U.S. Treasury sanctions. At one point, an ally of the Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov appeared in the ownership register.
Such redirection is why diplomats and experts say it is too early to understand the changing landscape. The true new owners of some businesses might not be known for years, if ever.
"These guys," Urszula Nartowska, OBI's top lawyer, said, "they have the power of what they want to take. And you have to accept that."
In June, the Kremlin demonstrated what companies could expect: Moscow approved the Kinross gold mine sale, but with a stunning alteration. The sale price had been cut in half, to $ 340 million.
The buyer, Highland Gold, would later be blacklisted by British officials who said that gold provided a "significant income stream for Russia's war effort."
"The government realized they could dictate who buys, and maybe use that power to reward connected buyers," said Alan Kartashkin, a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton who spent decades in Moscow and has negotiated the exits of Western companies.
"I remember thinking," Mr. Kartashkin added, "once they feel they have the power to control entirely private transactions, where the government has no equity interest, they're not going to stop."
'This Business Is Already Russian'
The mood was celebratory in July when the Russian minister of industry and trade, Denis V. Manturov, appeared at a St. Petersburg elevator factory.
The plant had recently belonged to the world's largest elevator company, the Connecticut-based Otis Worldwide. Now it belonged to a firm controlled by Armen M. Sarkisyan, who had made a fortune running the Russian lottery in part thanks to government connections.
Mr. Manturov bragged that Moscow had brokered special arrangements for the sale. He gushed about a new production line and robust demand for elevators in Russian high-rises. "This business is already Russian," he said. It was now known as Meteor.
Mr. Sarkisyan is an example of a unique creation of the war: a businessman who was politically connected enough to win such a prize and rich enough to close the deal -- but not so closely linked to the Kremlin that he was subject to international sanctions.
Mr. Sarkisyan and others, almost overnight, absorbed huge corners of their markets.
When the Finnish elevator giant Kone tried to sell to its employees, the authorities rejected the deal. Once again, Mr. Sarkisyan's holding company, S8 Capital, became the buyer.
S8 Capital also moved into the tire business, snapping up the Russian operation of the German company Continental, before buying the top Russian tire maker, Cordiant, and entering talks to purchase the Russian factory of the Japanese tire maker Bridgestone.
S8 Capital did not respond to requests for comment.
By the summer of 2022, Russia's economy had stabilized, the ruble had rebounded and Mr. Putin's strategy shifted.
While early in the war, companies like McDonald's had sold to local managers or local business associates, with an option to return to Russia later, such deals soon became more difficult.
Having climbed out of crisis, the government wanted to do more than just keep the doors open. It increasingly wanted to dictate the terms of every deal.
In August of that year, Mr. Putin issued a decree requiring that companies in key industries obtain his signature before selling their Russian assets. Scores of businesses, including divisions of Siemens and Caterpillar, were suddenly subject to the whims of Mr. Putin himself.
"The government was beginning to tighten up the process, and it was becoming a lot more challenging," said Laura Brank, a lawyer at Dechert helping Western companies to exit. "I was telling clients we'd better get moving quickly."
The Subcommission
For most companies trying to leave Russia, the gatekeepers operate out of a gray government building near Red Square. Eleven days after the war began, Mr. Putin empaneled a special "subcommission" there to review requests to sell.
Mr. Putin's longtime finance minister, Anton G. Siluanov, leads the subcommission, which includes officials from the Kremlin, the central bank and key ministries.
They decide whether companies can leave and under what terms.
Once a company has struck a deal with a buyer, the negotiations often begin again -- this time in secret, between the buyer and one of the Russian government ministries. The seller is largely excluded. That process, lawyers say, often ends with a lower sale price and at times a new buyer. The deal then goes to the subcommission. Sometimes, deals fall through after months of silence.
Internal minutes, reviewed by The Times, show that the subcommission scrutinizes even the smallest details. In one meeting last year, the panel approved the $ 59,000 sale of a tiny apartment owned by the Finnish tire company Nokian.
The subcommission wields enormous power. Minutes show that it rejected a proposal by the American electronics company Honeywell to sell its factories until an assessment proved that the Russian buyer was getting a 50 percent discount.
Despite the bureaucracy, businesspeople have jockeyed behind the scenes for the most lucrative assets, often appealing directly to Mr. Putin.
Such was the case in the summer of 2022, when Mondi, a British-Austrian paper company, found a buyer for one of Russia's largest mills and sought government approval to sell.
As the deal came together, one of Mr. Putin's old K.G.B. buddies, Sergei V. Chemezov, appeared. He wrote a letter asking that the president steer the mill toward a group of investors, including the state-owned firm he runs. He even suggested a way to structure the deal to get around Western sanctions. The Times reviewed a copy of the letter.
Neither Mr. Chemezov nor the state-owned company responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Chemezov's deal never happened, but neither did Mondi's original agreement. The subcommission put the mill in the hands of a Moscow property developer for significantly less than the original price.
Abroad, Professor Sonnenfeld and others kept up the pressure. More than 200 companies had earned "F" grades on his list. Professor Sonnenfeld testified before Congress in November 2022. Remaining in Russia, he said, was tantamount to supporting the government.
But under Mr. Putin's rules, leaving also directly benefited the government and, in turn, the war.
This year, the parent company of Ikea sold its Russian malls to a state-controlled bank. Nokian sold its operation to an oil company owned by a Russian regional government. The Russian operations of Nissan, Renault and Toyota were taken over by a state company.
The Russian government has looked to use former Western auto factories to produce vehicles, yachts and private jets for the state-owned luxury brand Aurus, according to an internal Trade Ministry document obtained by The Times.
Neither the Trade nor Finance Ministries responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Putin also found a way to bring money straight into state coffers.
Early on, foreign deals were subjected to what the government called a "voluntary tax" -- required for the privilege of taking money out of Russia in a lump sum. Companies that opted not to pay the tax would receive their payouts in installments.
But by early this year, Mr. Putin had stopped giving them the choice. Companies had to pay the tax, and they still might get their money in installments.
The Kremlin also made explicit what had been implied since the Kinross deal: Companies were required to sell for at least a 50 percent markdown.
Heineken, for About a Dollar
By 2023, the landscape had become unknowable. The Kremlin constantly changed the rules and seemed to be always demanding more. Companies including Unilever announced that they would rather remain in Russia than have their assets end up in the government's hands.
Against that backdrop, executives at Heineken and Carlsberg were still negotiating with prospective buyers this year when Mr. Putin awarded himself even greater powers.
The Russian government, he decreed in April, could seize foreign assets and put them under the temporary oversight of whomever it liked. Companies now risked being seized outright.
Heineken reached a deal that month and the buyer, a Kazakh businessman, requested government approval. Carlsberg executives followed suit, planning to sell to Arnest, the Russian aerosol maker that had recently snapped up the highly profitable drinks-packaging business of the U.S.-based Ball Corporation.
Both brewers felt confident that, more than a year after announcing plans to leave Russia, they would finally do so.
In July, Mr. Putin blindsided Carlsberg executives by seizing the company and placing it in the hands of his longtime associate and judo friend, Taimuraz Bolloev.
Carlsberg was an attractive target. The company controlled the iconic Russian beer brand Baltika and had recently valued its Russian operation at about $ 3 billion. Its sales application had revealed that it was sitting on a half-billion dollars in cash.
In another twist, Russian officials also rejected Heineken's deal. According to the people close to the negotiations, the authorities steered the business toward Arnest -- a consolation, perhaps, for having lost the far more lucrative Carlsberg.
The deal went through for a single euro and the promise to repay $ 100 million in debt.
For Carlsberg executives, the saga was far from over. Mr. Bolloev, they said, has pressured them to sign over the company permanently.
"It would require that we literally did a deal with Putin and his administration, creating a legitimate transaction where they could take over our business for basically close to nothing," Jacob Aarup-Andersen, the Carlsberg chief executive, said in an interview last month. "We just couldn't do that."
Within weeks, the Russian authorities had arrested two company employees and raided their homes. This month, Russian news outlets reported, Mr. Bolloev asked the authorities to nationalize the company.
Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president who is the deputy chairman of Russia's security council, expressed no sympathy for companies trying to move money out of the country and take it back to the very countries arming Ukraine.
He taunted Carlsberg, thanking them for padding the Russian budget.
"A strong budget means help for the front," he wrote last month. "In this regard, the senseless Danes also contribute to modern Russian weapons."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Soon after Russian troops invaded his country, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, made a plea to Western companies: "Leave Russia," he said. "Make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny."
Hundreds of companies answered the call. Politicians and activists predicted that it would help strangle the Russian economy and undermine the Kremlin's war effort.
President Vladimir V. Putin had other plans.
Mr. Putin has turned the exits of major Western companies into a windfall for Russia's loyal elite and the state itself. He has forced companies wishing to sell to do so at fire-sale prices. He has limited sales to buyers anointed by Moscow. Sometimes he has seized firms outright.
A New York Times investigation traced how Mr. Putin has turned an expected misfortune into an enrichment scheme. Western companies that have announced departures have declared more than $ 103 billion in losses since the start of the war, according to a Times analysis of financial reports. Mr. Putin has squeezed companies for as much of that wealth as possible by dictating the terms of their departure.
He has also subjected those exits to ever-increasing taxes, generating at least $ 1.25 billion in the past year for Russia's war chest.
No private deal is safe. The Dutch beer company Heineken, for example, found a buyer this spring and set a price. But the Russian government unilaterally rejected the deal, people close to the negotiations said, and put the company's Russian holdings in the hands of an aerosol-packaging titan married to a former Russian senator.
In all, Mr. Putin has overseen one of the biggest transfers of wealth within Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Huge swaths of industries -- elevators, tires, industrial coatings and more -- are now in the hands of increasingly dominant Russian players.
In some cases, that player is the state. Government-owned enterprises have acquired the assets of corporate giants like Ikea and Toyota. In many cases, Mr. Putin personally signs off on sales.
"These are good deals for us, for sure," said Anton Pinsky, a prominent restaurateur who joined with a pro-Putin rapper and associates of a powerful senator to take over Starbucks. In an interview in Moscow, he downplayed the significance of his own deal but was clear about the effect of the Western departures.
"You screwed up, left it," he said. "We picked it up inexpensively. Thank you."
Today in Russia, a robust consumer world carries on, helping Mr. Putin maintain a sense of normalcy despite a war that has proved longer, deadlier and costlier than he predicted.
Most foreign companies remain in Russia, unwilling to lose the billions they've invested there over decades. Other businesses have been sold and now have a through-the-looking-glass feel. Krispy Kreme is now Krunchy Dream; its doughnuts come in a similar flat box with familiar flavors. Starbucks has been reborn as Stars Coffee. Its mermaid is now a Russian swan princess.
These companies can buy raw materials domestically or import them from friendly countries. And customers can still easily buy products that have supposedly been pulled from shelves. On a recent day, a Moscow supermarket offered Pepsi from Uzbekistan and Coca-Cola from Poland.
Mr. Putin's economic counterstrikes have helped to fortify support among the elites profiting from the war and to blunt the effects of Western isolation. While Ukraine is preoccupied with short-term imperatives like shoring up international support, the relative resilience of the Russian economy has enabled Mr. Putin to play a long game.
Previously undisclosed documents, financial statements and interviews with dozens of deal makers in Russia and across Europe -- many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution -- show that Moscow now micromanages practically every exit. Companies must navigate an opaque system to win approval to sell. In some cases, Mr. Putin's friends have appealed directly to him to intervene.
"Those who are leaving are losing their position," Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told The Times. "And of course, their property is being bought at a serious discount and taken over by our companies, which are doing it with pleasure."
Still, the wave of departing companies has stung. It has sent a global signal that Russia is a business pariah. The economy is strained and at risk of overheating. Mr. Putin's handling of Western departures has only reinforced Russia's image as a dangerous place to do business. Even some top Russian officials admit that decreased competition and foreign investment will hurt everyday Russians and the economy in the long term.
The Kremlin says it prefers that companies remain in Russia. But Mr. Putin scoffs at the notion that leaving will hurt. "Did they think everything would collapse here? Well, nothing of the kind happened," he said this month. "Russian companies took over and moved on."
Not every deal is a windfall. Some buyers will face steep obstacles to make their new businesses profitable.
Hanging over the exit process for Western firms is the threat of intimidation and force. The Russian authorities have investigated departing companies, interrogated workers and arrested local executives.
Last summer, Mr. Putin seized the Russian arm of the Danish brewer Carlsberg, along with roughly half a billion dollars in cash, and put them under the temporary control of one of his friends.
At least four other companies have similarly lost control of their operations this year to effective state seizures.
Today, Mr. Putin is at the helm of a fraught exit process that works to Russia's advantage. But it began in the early days of the war with the urgent goal of simply keeping the Russian economy alive.
Speaking from the White House two weeks after the invasion, President Biden boasted that the West was crushing the Russian economy. "The list of businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing by the day," he said.
Things looked bleak for Mr. Putin. The stock exchange in Moscow was closed and the ruble had crashed. If Russia lost all the jobs, production and cash of Western companies, the effects would be devastating.
But Mr. Putin was preparing his financial rejoinder. He restricted the movement of money abroad and required that companies from "unfriendly nations" win approval before selling their businesses.
Mr. Putin was putting the brakes on just as Western executives faced pressure to accelerate. In the United States, there was perhaps no more vocal figure than the Yale University management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. He appeared on cable news programs, criticizing companies that remained in Russia.
Professor Sonnenfeld recalled that it was corporate boycotts -- more than sanctions -- that helped abolish apartheid in South Africa. He transformed his office into a sort of war room, with a Yale team grading companies on their efforts to sever Russian ties.
The question of who would end up with those companies was of little concern.
"If Putin thinks he can do better at the deep fryer, let him have at it," he said in an interview. "We really don't care. The important thing is to not have the endorsement of a renowned global brand."
Professor Sonnenfeld's list and others like it added to pressure from shareholders, Ukrainian activists and everyday consumers.
Some executives worried what would happen to their Russian employees, factories and technology if they walked away. Others were reluctant to abandon their investments over a war that might prove short-lived.
But some quickly announced intentions to go. Heineken and Carlsberg said that they would leave once they found buyers. The Canadian gold mining company Kinross did the same, and within days announced a deal for $ 680 million to sell its Russian operation to a local buyer.
OBI, a German hardware store chain, went a step further, saying that it would close all 27 stores in Russia until it found a buyer.
Mr. Putin's government, though, was already erecting hurdles.
On March 17, 2022, the Russian Trade Ministry sent a letter to local OBI managers. The letter, reviewed by The Times, urged managers to defy the company and keep the stores open, citing consumer-protection laws. There was no "economic reason" for closing, the ministry wrote.
OBI, the ministry warned, needed to fulfill "obligations to its consumers, workers and counterparties, including suppliers." That prompted a days-long cat-and-mouse game as local employees tried to reopen stores and executives in Germany tried to stop them.
The Russian authorities also demanded that OBI officials testify about their plans. Prosecutors visited a store and inspected its computer system, the company told The Times.
OBI struck a deal that spring, ultimately selling for the symbolic price of a few dollars.
The buyer, a businessman named Josef Liokumovich, passed the company's background checks and was not on any financial blacklists. But as OBI soon learned, Western companies have no control over who ultimately takes over their operations.
In less than a year, OBI's Russia operation changed owners four times, ultimately landing with associates of the Russian senator Arsen B. Kanokov, who is under U.S. Treasury sanctions. At one point, an ally of the Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov appeared in the ownership register.
Such redirection is why diplomats and experts say it is too early to understand the changing landscape. The true new owners of some businesses might not be known for years, if ever.
"These guys," Urszula Nartowska, OBI's top lawyer, said, "they have the power of what they want to take. And you have to accept that."
In June, the Kremlin demonstrated what companies could expect: Moscow approved the Kinross gold mine sale, but with a stunning alteration. The sale price had been cut in half, to $ 340 million.
The buyer, Highland Gold, would later be blacklisted by British officials who said that gold provided a "significant income stream for Russia's war effort."
"The government realized they could dictate who buys, and maybe use that power to reward connected buyers," said Alan Kartashkin, a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton who spent decades in Moscow and has negotiated the exits of Western companies.
"I remember thinking," Mr. Kartashkin added, "once they feel they have the power to control entirely private transactions, where the government has no equity interest, they're not going to stop."
The mood was celebratory in July when the Russian minister of industry and trade, Denis V. Manturov, appeared at a St. Petersburg elevator factory.
The plant had recently belonged to the world's largest elevator company, the Connecticut-based Otis Worldwide. Now it belonged to a firm controlled by Armen M. Sarkisyan, who had made a fortune running the Russian lottery in part thanks to government connections.
Mr. Manturov bragged that Moscow had brokered special arrangements for the sale. He gushed about a new production line and robust demand for elevators in Russian high-rises. "This business is already Russian," he said. It was now known as Meteor.
Mr. Sarkisyan is an example of a unique creation of the war: a businessman who was politically connected enough to win such a prize and rich enough to close the deal -- but not so closely linked to the Kremlin that he was subject to international sanctions.
Mr. Sarkisyan and others, almost overnight, absorbed huge corners of their markets.
When the Finnish elevator giant Kone tried to sell to its employees, the authorities rejected the deal. Once again, Mr. Sarkisyan's holding company, S8 Capital, became the buyer.
S8 Capital also moved into the tire business, snapping up the Russian operation of the German company Continental, before buying the top Russian tire maker, Cordiant, and entering talks to purchase the Russian factory of the Japanese tire maker Bridgestone.
S8 Capital did not respond to requests for comment.
By the summer of 2022, Russia's economy had stabilized, the ruble had rebounded and Mr. Putin's strategy shifted.
While early in the war, companies like McDonald's had sold to local managers or local business associates, with an option to return to Russia later, such deals soon became more difficult.
Having climbed out of crisis, the government wanted to do more than just keep the doors open. It increasingly wanted to dictate the terms of every deal.
In August of that year, Mr. Putin issued a decree requiring that companies in key industries obtain his signature before selling their Russian assets. Scores of businesses, including divisions of Siemens and Caterpillar, were suddenly subject to the whims of Mr. Putin himself.
"The government was beginning to tighten up the process, and it was becoming a lot more challenging," said Laura Brank, a lawyer at Dechert helping Western companies to exit. "I was telling clients we'd better get moving quickly."
For most companies trying to leave Russia, the gatekeepers operate out of a gray government building near Red Square. Eleven days after the war began, Mr. Putin empaneled a special "subcommission" there to review requests to sell.
Mr. Putin's longtime finance minister, Anton G. Siluanov, leads the subcommission, which includes officials from the Kremlin, the central bank and key ministries.
They decide whether companies can leave and under what terms.
Once a company has struck a deal with a buyer, the negotiations often begin again -- this time in secret, between the buyer and one of the Russian government ministries. The seller is largely excluded. That process, lawyers say, often ends with a lower sale price and at times a new buyer. The deal then goes to the subcommission. Sometimes, deals fall through after months of silence.
Internal minutes, reviewed by The Times, show that the subcommission scrutinizes even the smallest details. In one meeting last year, the panel approved the $ 59,000 sale of a tiny apartment owned by the Finnish tire company Nokian.
The subcommission wields enormous power. Minutes show that it rejected a proposal by the American electronics company Honeywell to sell its factories until an assessment proved that the Russian buyer was getting a 50 percent discount.
Despite the bureaucracy, businesspeople have jockeyed behind the scenes for the most lucrative assets, often appealing directly to Mr. Putin.
Such was the case in the summer of 2022, when Mondi, a British-Austrian paper company, found a buyer for one of Russia's largest mills and sought government approval to sell.
As the deal came together, one of Mr. Putin's old K.G.B. buddies, Sergei V. Chemezov, appeared. He wrote a letter asking that the president steer the mill toward a group of investors, including the state-owned firm he runs. He even suggested a way to structure the deal to get around Western sanctions. The Times reviewed a copy of the letter.
Neither Mr. Chemezov nor the state-owned company responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Chemezov's deal never happened, but neither did Mondi's original agreement. The subcommission put the mill in the hands of a Moscow property developer for significantly less than the original price.
Abroad, Professor Sonnenfeld and others kept up the pressure. More than 200 companies had earned "F" grades on his list. Professor Sonnenfeld testified before Congress in November 2022. Remaining in Russia, he said, was tantamount to supporting the government.
But under Mr. Putin's rules, leaving also directly benefited the government and, in turn, the war.
This year, the parent company of Ikea sold its Russian malls to a state-controlled bank. Nokian sold its operation to an oil company owned by a Russian regional government. The Russian operations of Nissan, Renault and Toyota were taken over by a state company.
The Russian government has looked to use former Western auto factories to produce vehicles, yachts and private jets for the state-owned luxury brand Aurus, according to an internal Trade Ministry document obtained by The Times.
Neither the Trade nor Finance Ministries responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Putin also found a way to bring money straight into state coffers.
Early on, foreign deals were subjected to what the government called a "voluntary tax" -- required for the privilege of taking money out of Russia in a lump sum. Companies that opted not to pay the tax would receive their payouts in installments.
But by early this year, Mr. Putin had stopped giving them the choice. Companies had to pay the tax, and they still might get their money in installments.
The Kremlin also made explicit what had been implied since the Kinross deal: Companies were required to sell for at least a 50 percent markdown.
By 2023, the landscape had become unknowable. The Kremlin constantly changed the rules and seemed to be always demanding more. Companies including Unilever announced that they would rather remain in Russia than have their assets end up in the government's hands.
Against that backdrop, executives at Heineken and Carlsberg were still negotiating with prospective buyers this year when Mr. Putin awarded himself even greater powers.
The Russian government, he decreed in April, could seize foreign assets and put them under the temporary oversight of whomever it liked. Companies now risked being seized outright.
Heineken reached a deal that month and the buyer, a Kazakh businessman, requested government approval. Carlsberg executives followed suit, planning to sell to Arnest, the Russian aerosol maker that had recently snapped up the highly profitable drinks-packaging business of the U.S.-based Ball Corporation.
Both brewers felt confident that, more than a year after announcing plans to leave Russia, they would finally do so.

Behind the Culinary Magic of Cookie Week: [briefing]

Full text: A behind-the-scenes guide to Cookie Week.
Hi, everyone! I'm Vaughn, a supervising video producer for New York Times Cooking. And today, we're talking all about cookies. Specifically, what separates the humdrum from the ho-ho-ho, the blasé from the trailblazing, the "just fine" from the "those were the best I've ever had."
For the past four years, I, along with my colleagues at NYT Cooking, have put together our favorite holiday cookies for a tradition we call "Cookie Week." It started as a sort of YouTube cookie swap amid the pandemic -- the brainchild of a small but mighty video team, featuring seven Cooking personalities baking up magic over the course of seven days, all shot by the talent themselves, in their homes. It's now become a full-on multiverse, complete with a stunning spread in the paper of record, daily videos, a newsletter, live events and the most delightful and dazzling cookies the New York Times Cooking team could muster.
(We tried to get Mariah but she was too expensive.)
Over these four years, I've learned a lot about what types of treats folks find outstanding during the holidays. They love twists on nostalgic classics, unexpected flavor combinations and eye-catching decoration. This year, we sought cookies that hit all those marks and beautifully balance each other in a box: electric colors alongside warm, rich tones; citrusy, chocolaty and earthy flavors; a variety of textures, shapes and sizes. With chewy gingerbread blondies, buttery lemon swoops and spicy hot chocolate crinkles (to name a few), I firmly believe there's something for everyone in this batch.
Above are the seven developers (including myself!) behind all the magic. Eric, whose holiday cookies are as nostalgic as they are evocative; Melissa, whom many consider to be the GOAT (her gingerbread blondies do not disprove that); Sue, whose precise technique and gorgeous flavors always shine; Samantha, who not only developed her own showstopper but also styled all of the cookies for the photo shoot; me, who [insert something nice about Vaughn here]; Yewande, whose cookies are always as stylish as they are brimming with flavor; and Sohla, who has more fun in the kitchen than anyone I've ever met and is a baking genius.
Though I supervise the video team, I also develop recipes and appear on camera, so I'm in on Cookie Week from the ground floor up. I get asked a lot of questions about the process behind it all: When do we start? What is the brainstorming process like? How do you come up with the ideas?
Here are some demystifying facts and figures: Every July we start throwing around ideas (begrudgingly, because it's still summer and we don't want to think about the holidays yet). We then approach our Cookie Week squad with a request for four or five ideas each, and from there our editors narrow the list to one that exhibits every cookie quality we look for. It takes weeks of working and reworking, going back for more pitches, and helping the developers to get their cookies just right. I have fond memories of testing out different icing techniques one day in our cooking studio with my pal Samantha, until finally landing on one that felt glamorous and vibrant, yet completely doable for home bakers.
To me, that's the best part about Cookie Week: the rewarding feeling I get when I see people making them all over the world, reaching out to ask me a question or tell me how much their family loved my cookies, or simply commenting on the YouTube video that they can't wait to try them. Cookie Week is first and foremost about joy -- about getting in the kitchen and expressing your love through food.

Israel-Hamas War
Israel said some Hamas fighters had surrendered in northern Gaza, and that it had intensified its offensive in the south.
The University of Pennsylvania's president resigned, days after a congressional hearing during which she appeared to dodge a question about whether students who called for the genocide of Jews should be punished.
The State Department bypassed Congress to push through a government sale of tank ammunition to Israel.
For years, Qatar sent of millions of dollars to Gaza, which helped prop up Hamas. Benjamin Netanyahu's government encouraged the payments, believing that a steady flow of money maintained peace.

TALK | FROM THE TIMES MAGAZINE
I spoke with the ever-restless, ever-inquisitive musician David Byrne about curiosity and enchantment.
Do you think curiosity can be cultivated? Or are some people just more curious than others?
I think you can develop a willingness to try new things, but curiosity is kind of self-motivated. I sense that for many people, they love the feeling of the familiar and the secure and a place where the answers are. Whether the answers are through religion or their political affiliation or family, there's a security that comes with that, and that would imply maybe a lack of willingness to be curious and go outside that zone. I've been reading about the pre-Enlightenment.
Oh!
Which showed a similar kind of thing in some ways. Religion and other things provided all the answers. Then science comes along, and you maintain the how, but the why is now left behind. Max Weber talks about the great disenchantment. That's when everything in the world seems enchanted, and it's filled with a kind of spiritual power and then as science and everything starts to take over, things don't have that magical aura anymore.
Do you feel enchantment about the world?
I feel that. I think a lot of people in the sciences feel that, too. They feel that the way things work in physics or biology or whatever it might be is still kind of marvelous. Even though they're not just saying God or the gods made it this way, it's still moving and amazing. And this idea of ecology, our awareness of the network or web of connections in physics and nature and biology, there's a sense of wonder in that connection. It's not quite religious, but it is amazing.

Full text: The French fashion house took its Métiers d'Art show to the north of England and the home of soccer, Coronation Street and Northern soul.
Manchester is a city of glory and grit. Set among the damp northwest hills of England, it's the rain-spattered home of Northern soul and legendary bands like Joy Division, New Order and Oasis; two world famous soccer clubs; the cradle of the industrial revolution; and one of the most vibrant nightlife scenes on the planet. Style and swagger? This proud city has them in spades. But most people would not consider it a capital of high fashion.
That all changed this week when Chanel took over the town for its Métiers d'Art runway show, an annual presentation of the intricate craftsmanship of its specialist ateliers. Since 2002, the show has been held in Salzburg, Austria; Rome; and Dakar, Senegal, among other cities. On Thursday, 600 guests, braving icy winds and lashing rain, descended on the Northern Quarter neighborhood of Manchester for a runway show held on Thomas Street, lined with empty tattoo parlors, pubs, vintage clothing stores and record shops. (Their owners had been paid off handsomely to vacate them for the week.) As guests took their seats by candlelight on the street among A-listers like Kristen Stewart, Tilda Swinton and Hugh Grant -- under a giant purpose-built Perspex roof -- many sipped hot toddies to fortify themselves against the elements.
The show may not have had the glamour and grandeur of those at past Chanel sites. (Some eyebrows were raised when the location was announced earlier this year.) But the beauty of Manchester is not to be found in its gloomy buildings, many of which housed a once thriving textile and cotton trade. Rather, it is in the electric spirit and creativity that pulsates through the narrow streets of the city.
"We wanted this show to take place in England, but not in London, which felt too expected," the Chanel president, Bruno Pavlovsky, said before the show. Twenty-four hours earlier, guests had been treated to a raucous night in the stands at Old Trafford as they watched Manchester United beat Chelsea or to a recital at a local working men's club by the punk-rock-era poet John Cooper Clarke.
"Manchester has an incredible energy to its arts scene, its music and football culture, and ideas have been born here that have changed the world," Mr. Pavlovsky said. "That energy was incredibly inspiring to our creative director, Virginie Viard, and her vision for this collection."
Chanel loves to go to parts of the world that have ties to its founder, Coco Chanel. The family estate of the Duke of Westminster, her lover in the 1920s, was Eaton Hall in nearby Cheshire. Chanel worked on her designs there and would often drive to nearby factories to source cotton and velvet for her collections. The tweed jackets English aristocrats wore for outdoor pursuits, like shoots at Eaton Hall, would become a cornerstone of her fashion empire.
Tweed was also at the heart of the Chanel show that took place in Manchester this week, to a thumping soundtrack from the likes of Soft Cell, New Order and Cilla Black. (Someone should probably tell the organizers that Ms. Black is famous for being from Liverpool.)
The collection began with a modish hat tip to the 1960s and a series of smart tweed skirt suits in acid green, fuchsia, orange and yellow, some with matching baker boy caps and paired with Mary Janes. Then hemlines got shorter and out came the knitwear, all in coordinating intarsia patterns and prints and with chunky scarves tightly wound around the models' necks.
Since taking the creative helm of Chanel in 2019, Ms. Viard has been keen to bring a youthful verve to the house, often via a 1980s slant. That was here in outfits that paid tribute to New Wave club girls, with black denim and patent leather looks and sheer baby-doll dresses with bodices made from interlocking C's and graphic flourishes inspired by logos from the soccer stands.
A final series of more timeless sparkly minidresses closed the show -- a fitting tribute to the generations of barelegged Northern girls who have braved wintry streets in search of a good night out.
Any guests of that mindset were then taken in a fleet of limousines to an after-party at the Victoria Baths, home to Britain's finest historic swimming pool surrounded by stained glass windows and original Edwardian tiles. Inside, the band Primal Scream played a private set from the deep end of the pool (thankfully emptied of water) with music that went on until late, while scores of amused locals watched on from railings outside.
All of it was bags of fun, far more tongue-in-cheek than the usual fare from a French fashion house, and a spotlight on one of Britain's best-loved cities, which thoroughly deserves the attention and investment it reaped by the global fashion industry circus rolling into town. The designer Henry Holland summed it up best with his bold black and white poster commissioned for the event (most effective when imagined in a thick Northern accent): "Well well well -- if it isn't Manchester does Chanel."

George A. Cohon, Who Served McDiplomacy to Moscow, Dies at 86: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He was chairman of McDonald's in Canada and in Russia, where he opened the chain's first restaurant in 1990, engaging in what he called "hamburger diplomacy."
George A. Cohon, a Chicago-born entrepreneur who, by introducing the Big Mac -- or the Bolshoi Mak -- to Moscow in 1990, helped whet Russians' appetite for capitalism, died on Nov. 24 at his home in Toronto. He was 86.
His death was announced by his son Mark. No cause was given, but he was treated years earlier for prostate cancer.
A Fuller Brush salesman in college with a flair for merchandising, Mr. Cohon (pronounced CO-hen) abandoned his law practice when Ray Kroc, the McDonald's founder, offered him the chain's franchise for eastern Canada. Mr. Cohon borrowed $ 70,000 to buy the rights and opened his first restaurant in London, Ontario, in 1968.
In 1971, he traded the franchise for McDonald's stock and in 1992 became senior chairman of McDonald's Restaurants of Canada, which included some 1,500 eateries, and of McDonald's in Russia.
Though waiting on lines was part of daily life in Soviet Russia, opening day in Moscow -- Jan. 31, 1990 -- exceeded all expectations when an estimated 10,000 people queued up in Pushkin Square for Happy Meals and double cheeseburgers (Mr. Cohon's favorite). By the end of the day around 30,000 people had sampled the menu at the mammoth 700-seat restaurant, emblazoned with its trademark golden arches.
In his memoir "To Russia With Fries" (1997, with David Macfarlane), Mr. Cohon said that a chance encounter with a Russian delegation at the 1976 Montreal Olympics had prompted him to pursue 14 years of exasperating negotiations -- or what he called "hamburger diplomacy" -- to overcome the hurdles of Communist bureaucracy.
He was nearly strangled by the red tape. The Moscow municipality eventually wound up owning 51 percent of the Pushkin Square restaurant, and McDonald's had to build a $ 21 million processing plant and import many of the foodstuffs featured on its traditional menu.
Still, Mr. Cohon wrote, the restaurant's successful opening had finally "demonstrated that new economic relations between our country and the rest of the world were possible." He was later hailed by Pravda, then the official newspaper of the Soviet Union, as Russia's "Capitalist Hero of Labor."
Mr. Cohon managed to maintain friendly relations with most of the Kremlin's warring progressive factions, so that when Mikhail S. Gorbachev was deposed in 1991 and the Soviet Union atomized, McDonald's already had an in with his successor, Boris N. Yeltsin.
"In Russia, even states of emergency can be overcome with a well-placed gift," Mr. Cohon wrote.
In 2022, McDonald's announced that it would begin closing its 850 Russian restaurants and selling them off in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- the country from which Mr. Cohon's father's family had fled in the early 20th century in the wake of a pogrom.
George Alan Cohon was born on April 19, 1937, in the South Side neighborhood of Chicago. His father, Jack Cohon (born Kaganov), was a lawyer who took over his family's bakery when his father died. His mother, Carolyn (Ellis) Cohon, was a homemaker.
George received a Bachelor of Science from Drake University in Des Moines and graduated from the Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago in 1961. After serving in the Air Force, he practiced at his father's law firm from 1961 to 1967. At one point he unsuccessfully represented a client who was seeking a McDonald's franchise in Hawaii. The client was offered the Eastern Canada franchise but turned it down; Mr. Kroc then offered it to Mr. Cohon.
"'George, you don't want to be a lawyer for the rest of your life'," Mr. Cohon recalled Mr. Kroc saying. "'Why don't you get involved?"'
He accepted the offer and moved to Toronto with his family.
"We didn't know a soul, we didn't have much money, and McDonald's then was far from being the household word it is today," he wrote in his memoir.
He soon learned that Canadians like vinegar on their French fries. He went on to found the Canadian arm of Ronald McDonald House Charities, which has provided accommodations for more than 25,000 families whose children are receiving medical treatment.
"The pride I have is what I've been able to do through McDonald's, not only to sell hamburgers or to make a profit but to be a good member in communities around the world -- to help society," he told Foodservice and Hospitality magazine in 2015.
A Canadian citizen since 1973, Mr. Cohon was also instrumental in saving Toronto's annual Santa Claus Parade when the original sponsor withdrew.
In August, he was promoted to Companion of the Order of Canada -- the most prestigious honor granted by the country to a living civilian.
He lived in Toronto and had a vacation home in Palm Beach, Fla., where he was a trustee of the Society of the Four Arts, a nonprofit cultural programming organization.
In addition to his son Mark, who was commissioner of the Canadian Football League, Mr. Cohon is survived by another son, Craig, who helped introduce Coca-Cola to Russia; his wife, Susan (Silver) Cohon, whom he met at law school; his sister, Sandy Raizes; and three grandchildren.
At McDonald's in Canada, where he was chairman, president and chief executive until 1992, Mr. Cohon was a self-styled, hands-on "front counter kind of guy," as he wrote in his memoir. He handed out hamburger-shaped business cards that included a voucher for a free Big Mac.
The journalist and author Peter Newman had a slightly different take. In a book about Canada's elite titled "The Acquisitors" (1975), he wrote, "The mischievous twinkle that is George Cohon's trademark overlays the glacial glint of a tax assessor's eyes."

Norman Lear, 101, Who Gave America Sitcom Gold, Dies: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As the producer of "All in the Family" and many other shows, Mr. Lear showed that it was possible to be topical, funny and immensely popular.
Norman Lear, the television writer and producer who introduced political and social commentary into situation comedy with "All in the Family" and other shows, proving that it was possible to be topical as well as funny while attracting millions of viewers, died on Tuesday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 101.
A spokeswoman for the family, Lara Bergthold, confirmed the death.
Mr. Lear reigned at the top of the television world through the 1970s and into the early '80s, leaving a lasting mark with shows that brought the sitcom into the real world.
"The Jeffersons" looked at the struggles faced by an upwardly mobile Black family; a very different Black family on "Good Times" dealt with poverty and discrimination. The protagonist of "Maude" was an outspoken feminist; the heroine of "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" was plagued by all manner of modern-day problems, not least her own neurosis.
"You looked around television in those years," Mr. Lear said in a 2012 New York Times interview, referring to the middle and late 1960s, "and the biggest problem any family faced was 'Mother dented the car, and how do you keep Dad from finding out'; 'the boss is coming to dinner, and the roast's ruined.' The message that was sending out was that we didn't have any problems."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mr. Lear's shows sent different messages, far more in tune with what was actually happening in those turbulent times. His crowning achievement was "All in the Family," and his greatest creation was Archie Bunker, the focus of that show and one of the most enduring characters in television history.
An unapologetic bigot who was seemingly always angry at one minority group or another (and usually at least one family member as well), Archie, memorably portrayed by Carroll O'Connor, was also, with his malaprops, his mangled syntax and his misguided enthusiasm, strangely likable.
A Sitcom Shockwave
"All in the Family" sent a shock through the sleepy world of the sitcom with one tart, topical episode after another from the moment it premiered on CBS on Jan. 12, 1971.
Even now, more than 50 years later, there are critics who say that this date should live in infamy, that ABC was right when it turned down the show out of fear that it would offend too many people. Archie, in this view, was a fanatic who made narrow-mindedness seem appealing.
But Mr. Lear, who adapted "All in the Family" from a British sitcom and based Archie in part on his own father, saw it differently. "I've never known a bigot who didn't have something endearing," he once said.
Mr. Lear went on to create a television empire and to become politically active, notably with his founding of the liberal advocacy organization People for the American Way, the kind of organization that Archie Bunker would have enjoyed sneering at.
Archie had choice words for all races, creeds and sexual orientations (except his own), and he didn't spare his family. His sweet and dignified wife, Edith (Jean Stapleton), was a "dingbat"; his daughter, Gloria (Sally Struthers), was "a weepin' Nellie"; his liberal son-in-law, Michael Stivic (Rob Reiner), was a "meathead" and, on occasion, a "dumb Polack." Strictly a law-and-order guy, Archie also voiced strong reservations about what he saw as campus subversives, welfare chiselers and bleeding hearts.
Such pronouncements were scandalous in the prime-time television world of the day. But Mr. Lear had found a gold mine.
"All in the Family" ran until 1979 and dominated the ratings for most of that time. More important, it established a template for television comedy by mixing political and social messages, as well as moments of serious drama, with the laughter.
The Lear philosophy was further developed in two shows built around characters who originally appeared on "All in the Family": "Maude" and "The Jeffersons."
"Maude," which ran from 1972 to 1978 on CBS, centered on Edith Bunker's cousin Maude Findlay (Bea Arthur), who was as much a doctrinaire liberal as Archie was a determined denizen of the far, far right. The show dealt with alcoholism, pot smoking, abortion (Maude herself had one, in a two-part episode that generated outrage as well as applause) and other subjects to which that quick-tongued title character could apply her shrill wisdom.
George Jefferson (Sherman Hemsley), the central character of "The Jeffersons," was a Black man who ran a successful dry-cleaning business in Archie's neighborhood and whose disdain for white people rivaled Archie's for Black people. "The Jeffersons," the story of George's life with his newly moneyed family after they moved to the East Side of Manhattan, ran on CBS from 1975 to 1985.
Not all of Mr. Lear's shows grew out of Archie's universe. One that did not, "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman," raised as many eyebrows as "All in the Family."
A five-episodes-a-week spoof of soap operas, "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" was the story of a television-obsessed housewife (Louise Lasser in the title role) in the fictional small town of Fernwood, Ohio, who had more than her share of calamity: Her grandfather was a flasher, her mother was a flake, her husband was cheating on her, their daughter was kidnapped, and Mary herself had a breakdown on live TV.
"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" was too hot for the networks. Mr. Lear syndicated it himself, and in most markets it was on after the late news.
He said he thought of the show as "affirmative" and its characters as "survivors." But for all the waves they made, they did not survive long.
The show made its debut in 1976, Ms. Lasser left the next year, and, after being replaced for the summer by the talk-show parody "Fernwood 2-Night" (which later morphed into "America 2-Night") and then returning without her as "Forever Fernwood," it was gone by early 1978.
Other Lear shows had longer lives. "Sanford and Son," starring the longtime Black comedian Redd Foxx as an irascible junk dealer -- and, like "All in the Family," based on a successful British sitcom -- ran on NBC from 1972 to 1977. "One Day at a Time" (CBS, 1975-84) concerned a divorced woman (Bonnie Franklin) living on her own with two teenage daughters. "Good Times" (CBS, 1974-79), a spinoff of "Maude," was the story of a hard-working Black woman (Esther Rolle) struggling to raise a family in a Chicago housing project -- at first with her husband (John Amos) and then, when Mr. Amos was let go, as a widow. (Ms. Rolle herself left the show after the fourth season, unhappy with the direction it had taken, but returned a year later.)
Son of a Salesman
Norman Milton Lear was born on July 27, 1922, in New Haven, Conn., to Herman and Jeanette (Seicol) Lear. His father was a salesman of various products who was not very good at selling much of anything, who sometimes ran afoul of the law, and who had, his son later recalled, more than a hint of Archie in him. He would tell his wife to "stifle" herself, just as Archie would with Edith, and more than once told Norman, "You are the laziest white kid I ever saw."
Raised mostly in Hartford, Norman graduated from Weaver High School there in 1940 and attended Emerson College in Boston, but left shortly after the United States entered World War II to enlist in the Army Air Forces. He rose to technical sergeant and flew 52 missions as a radioman, most from a base near Foggia, Italy. He received the Air Medal with four oak-leaf clusters.
After the war, millions of servicemen and women took advantage of the G.I. Bill of Rights to attend college, but Mr. Lear decided he would not return to Emerson. With the help of an uncle who was a press agent, he got a job with the publicity firm of George and Dorothy Ross, who had many clients in the theater. He lasted a year before being fired for planting one too many items that were demonstrably false.
He found a way to put his imagination to better use after he and his first wife, Charlotte, moved to Los Angeles in 1949. For a while he and a friend, Ed Simmons, worked as door-to-door salesmen. Eventually they started to write comedy routines together.
Their break came when Mr. Lear called the agent for the popular nightclub entertainer Danny Thomas, who would later become a TV star, and got his home phone number by pretending to be a New York Times reporter. Mr. Thomas appreciated the boldness of the ploy. He also liked the routine the two men wrote for him, and purchased it.
Television in its infancy needed material of all kinds, and Mr. Lear and Mr. Simmons soon became writers for Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, who were among the rotating hosts of "The Colgate Comedy Hour." They went on to write for "The Martha Raye Show" (which Mr. Lear directed as well), after which they went their separate ways. Mr. Lear wrote and produced "The George Gobel Show."
In 1958, Mr. Lear and his fellow writer Bud Yorkin formed Tandem Productions -- so named, they said, because they thought of themselves as not unlike two men going uphill on a tandem bicycle. The company produced the singer Andy Williams's long-running variety show, as well as many television specials and several movies.
Mr. Lear wrote the screenplay for the Tandem film "Come Blow Your Horn" (1963), starring Frank Sinatra, directed by Mr. Yorkin and based on a Neil Simon play. His script for "Divorce, American Style" (1967), starring Dick Van Dyke and Debbie Reynolds and also directed by Mr. Yorkin, was nominated for an Academy Award.
Mr. Lear was one of the writers of "The Night They Raided Minsky's" (1968), a celebration of the glory days of burlesque directed by William Friedkin. And he wrote and directed "Cold Turkey" (1971), also starring Mr. Van Dyke, about a town that quits cigarettes en masse to win a $ 25 million prize. He might have remained a reasonably successful but relatively obscure screenwriter and occasional director had he and Mr., Yorkin not learned about a BBC series called "Till Death Us Do Part."
That show, about an outspoken bigot and his family, was a hit in England. They thought they could adapt it for an American audience.
Mr. Lear wrote a script modeled on "Till Death Us Do Part," and he and Mr. Yorkin shot two pilot episodes for ABC. The network, however, rejected the show, originally titled "Justice for All" (the lead character was originally named Archie Justice), and CBS almost did, too, but Robert D. Wood, the president of CBS Television at the time, had faith in the idea. He fought for it and put the show, by then named "All in the Family," on the air.
A Hot-Button Hit
Some critics embraced the show; many did not. John Leonard, writing in Life magazine under his pen name Cyclops, called it "wretched." Fred Ferretti of The New York Times wrote that its ethnic slurs "shock because one is not used to hearing them shouted from the television tube during prime-time family programs." They "don't make one laugh," he added, "so much as they force self-conscious, semi-amused gasps."
But the public liked it. After being moved from Tuesday to Saturday, it became the top-rated show on television, and while moving in and out of different spots on the schedule, it remained at the top for five consecutive seasons. In March 1972, The Times reported that at 8 p.m. every Saturday, 60 percent of all television sets in America were turned to it, and from 50 million to 60 million viewers were watching -- among them Sammy Davis Jr., who rearranged his performing schedule so that he could watch in his dressing room. Mr. Davis made a memorable guest appearance, as himself, on an episode of the show that year, in which he famously took Archie by surprise by kissing him on the cheek.
Mr. Davis expressed amazement that anyone would be insulted by "All in the Family," but over the years many groups said they were -- and not just ethnic groups. Some older Americans, for instance, took offense to an episode in which two people were married in a nursing home and the bride fell asleep. Mr. Lear agreed not to permit its rebroadcast. It was one of the few occasions when he seemed to find merit in the complaints of his critics.
The debates never really stopped, but the show continued to garner high ratings into the late 1970s. Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers left after the 1977-78 season, and "All in the Family" went off the air in 1979. Mr. O'Connor continued to play Archie on "Archie Bunker's Place," which made its debut that fall in the same time slot, focusing on Archie as the proprietor of a neighborhood bar.
Jean Stapleton appeared on a few episodes of the new show before deciding, as she put it, that if she continued to play Edith Bunker "people will never think of me as anyone else." When the second season began, viewers learned that Edith had died. "Archie Bunker's Place" remained on the air until 1983.
"All in the Family" and its various cast members, writers and directors won 22 Emmy Awards, including three for Mr. Lear. In 1972, when the show won seven, Johnny Carson, that year's host, called the Emmy telecast "the Norman Lear show." Mr. Lear's shows were so successful for so long that Bob Hope once remarked, "We can all be proud of TV and its owner, Norman Lear."
But Mr. Lear also had his share of flops. In 1975, his "Hot L Baltimore," a sitcom set in a run-down hotel and based on a play by Lanford Wilson, lasted 13 weeks on ABC. And after a few more short-lived shows, his hot streak was over by the mid-1980s. Some later projects -- among them "704 Hauser" (1994), about a Black family living in Archie Bunker's former home -- were on the air for only a few weeks; others never got off the ground.
Working Till the End
Mr. Lear nevertheless kept his hand in television. In 2003, he helped write a few episodes of "South Park," the taboo-breaking animated series that was the "All in the Family" of its day. (The show's creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, have said that their bile-spewing character Eric Cartman is partly based on Archie Bunker.)
In 2009, Mr. Lear developed a series about professional wrestling for HBO, although it was not picked up. For several years he found no takers for his proposed series about retirees in Southern California, "Guess Who Died?"; that changed in 2017, when NBC committed to produce a pilot, but a year later the network declined to pick up the show.
Still working into his 90s, Mr. Lear was the executive producer of a new version of "One Day at a Time," centered on a Latino family, for Netflix. That series made its debut in 2017, to enthusiastic reviews, and lasted three seasons.
In July 2021, on his 99th birthday, TBS announced that it would develop a reboot of "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman," starring Emily Hampshire, with Mr. Lear as an executive producer. The show has not yet begun production, but at his death Mr. Lear had other projects in the works, including an animated version of "Good Times"; a reboot of "Who's the Boss?"; and a sitcom, starring Laverne Cox and the comedian George Wallace, about a man who learns that his adult son has transitioned.
In May 2019, Mr. Lear and Jimmy Kimmel hosted a TV special on which episodes of "All in the Family" and "The Jeffersons" were recreated live by an all-star cast, including Woody Harrelson as Archie Bunker and Jamie Foxx as George Jefferson. The special was produced by Mr. Lear, Mr. Kimmel and others as part of a deal Mr. Lear had signed with Sony that included an option to reimagine his past shows and potentially produce reboots. A second special, recreating episodes of "All in the Family" and "Good Times," aired that December; a third, recreating episodes of two other series Mr. Lear's company had produced, "The Facts of Life" and "Diff'rent Strokes," was broadcast in 2021.
"Live in Front of a Studio Audience: Norman Lear's 'All in the Family' and 'The Jeffersons"' won an Emmy Award, making Mr. Lear, at 97, the oldest Emmy winner in history. It was his fifth Emmy but his first in 46 years. (The others had all been for "All in the Family.") He broke his own record by winning another Emmy the next year for "Live in Front of a Studio Audience: 'All in the Family' and 'Good Times."'
Honors and Activism
His other honors included lifetime achievement awards from the Producers Guild of America, the Television Critics Association and PEN Center USA. He was among the first inductees in the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1984, and he won Peabody Awards in 1977 (for "All in the Family") and 2016 (for his life's work). In 1999, President Bill Clinton awarded him a National Medal of Arts.
Mr. Lear was named a recipient of a Kennedy Center Honor in 2017. He attended the ceremony in Washington but skipped the reception at the White House, citing his unhappiness with the policies of the Trump administration.
"This is a presidency that has chosen to neglect totally the arts and humanities -- deliberately defund them -- and that doesn't rest pleasantly with me," he said in an interview with The Times.
Mr. Lear turned his attention back to movies in 1982, when he, Mr. Yorkin and Jerry Perenchio bought Avco Embassy Pictures. The newly renamed Embassy Communications released films, including Ingmar Bergman's "Fanny and Alexander" (1982) and the acclaimed mock documentary "This Is Spinal Tap" (1984), directed by the "All in the Family" alumnus Rob Reiner.
In 1985, after Mr. Lear acquired Mr. Yorkin's share, he and Mr. Perenchio sold Embassy and Tandem to the Coca-Cola Company for $ 485 million. That same year, Mr. Lear founded Act III Communications, named to signify the third act of his life. Act III's most notable productions were two other Rob Reiner films, "Stand by Me" (1986) and "The Princess Bride" (1987).
Mr. Lear entered the music business in 1999, when he and a partner acquired the Concord Music Group. (The company merged with Village Roadshow Entertainment Group in 2008 and was sold to Wood Creek Capital Management in 2013.)
Mr. Lear never made a secret of his liberal leanings, but he became increasingly active politically with the founding of People for the American Way in 1980 as a response to the Moral Majority and other voices on the right. The organization's efforts have included opposing a constitutional amendment barring desecration of the American flag, joining lawsuits on behalf of abortion rights and publishing the book "Hostile Climate: Report on Anti-Gay Activity."
In 1985, after almost 30 years of marriage, Mr. Lear and his second wife, Frances, reached a divorce settlement estimated at $ 100 million or more, money she used to found Lear's magazine. (The magazine went out of business after six years.) He later married Lyn Davis, a psychologist, who survives him.
He is also survived by their son, Benjamin; their daughters, Brianna and Madeline Lear; a daughter from his first marriage, Ellen Lear; two daughters from his second marriage, Kate and Maggie Lear; and four grandchildren.
Frances Lear died in 1996.
Mr. Lear's resources remained formidable even after his divorce, and he continued to give both money and time to numerous causes.
In 1989, he founded the Business Enterprise Trust to promote socially responsible business behavior and was among the founders of the Environmental Media Association, which encourages entertainment industry efforts to educate people about environmental issues. In 2003, he founded Declare Yourself, a nonprofit organization to motivate people between the ages of 18 and 29 to register to vote.
His $ 5 million pledge to the University of Southern California in the 1999-2000 academic year helped establish the Norman Lear Center at the university's Annenberg School for Communication, which offers a multidisciplinary program for the study of entertainment as a central component of 21st-century life.
In 2014, he published his autobiography, "Even This I Get to Experience." In the process of writing it, he told The New York Times, "I began to realize how hard it had been to be a human being."
He was also the subject of a documentary, "Norman Lear: Just Another Version of You," released in 2016.
On July 27, 2022, the day he turned 100, The Times published a guest essay by Mr. Lear in which he reflected on the state of the nation and observed, "To be honest, I'm a bit worried that I may be in better shape than our democracy is."
For all his political activism, Mr. Lear knew that he would be best remembered for his work in television. Interviewed by The Los Angeles Times in 2009, he offered a measured assessment of the impact shows like "All in the Family" had on society.
"I can't honestly say I can see anywhere where we changed anything," he said. "But what I have are thousands of memories of people relating to me that we made them talk. And you know, the funny thing is, people are still talking."

Charlie Munger's Investing Legacy: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The investor Charlie Munger, who died last week at age 99, liked the word "lollapalooza." The word appears 27 times in the new abridged edition of "Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Essential Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger."
I think Munger's fondness for that fanciful term -- which he meant as either a big gain or a big loss -- reveals a lot about his investing philosophy and that of his longtime partner, Warren Buffett. It's worth pondering what he meant, even though the style of investing he did isn't suitable for most of us.
Lollapalooza effects "can make you rich, or they can kill you," Munger wrote in his Benjamin Franklin-style "almanack." As I understand it, his advice is to minimize the risk of bad lollapaloozas because they destroy so much value that even good lollapaloozas won't be enough to dig you out of the hole you're in. Math is unforgiving that way: If you go down 80 percent and then up 80 percent, you will still be down 64 percent.
I had arranged with Munger's book publicists to interview him a day or two after Christmas. I'm sorry to have missed that opportunity. Still, the book speaks for itself. It combines his own writings and speeches with observations about him from others.
There's an impression that Buffett and Munger got rich by being good at picking stocks and entire companies to buy for Berkshire Hathaway, the Omaha-headquartered holding company of which Buffett is chairman and chief executive and Munger was vice chairman. They made their share of mistakes, though. In 2017, for example, Buffett and Munger told shareholders they had erred by loading up on IBM shares and giving Amazon, Google and Walmart a pass. Buying shares in USAir in 1989 was another famous misstep.
I think the real secret to their success -- and it's not really a secret, since they talked about it all the time -- is everything else they did aside from their initial choices of what to buy. That includes, for companies that Berkshire Hathaway owns outright, choosing chief executives carefully and then leaving them alone.
But let's focus on the lollapaloozas. Munger talked about "combinatorial effects" in which a variety of psychological forces, each mild enough in its own right, come together and reinforce one another to create good or bad lollapaloozas. The original success of Coca-Cola came from positive combinatorial effects, with the qualities of the product and the relentlessness of the advertising working together to habituate customers, he wrote. Conversely, he added, the ill-fated introduction of New Coke in 1985 suffered from a combination of several mistakes.
To get the good lollapaloozas and not the bad ones requires two things, from what I can glean from Munger's book and Berkshire Hathaway's famous annual shareholder letters. One is patience to wait for good opportunities, and the other is plentiful available cash when those opportunities finally present themselves.
Wise investors "bet heavily when the world offers them that opportunity" and sit on their hands the rest of the time, Munger said in the book. "But a huge majority of people have some other crazy construct in their heads. And instead of waiting for a near cinch and loading up, they apparently ascribe to the theory that if they work a little harder or hire more business school students, they'll come to know everything about everything all the time. To me, that's totally insane." A few good calls is all anyone needs or should expect in a lifetime, he argued.
As for the second part of the formula, plentiful cash, that's what makes it possible for Berkshire Hathaway to be "greedy when others are fearful," in Buffett's famous formulation. At the end of the third quarter this year, Berkshire Hathaway had $ 157 billion in cash, cash equivalents and Treasury bills. Those are low-yielding assets that most investors would consider an unacceptable drag on their performance, but they give Berkshire Hathaway the ability to pounce immediately on a promising investment.
Buffett and Munger discovered early that well-run insurance companies generate a lot of cash in the form of "float" -- money that's received in premiums and hasn't been paid out yet in claims. They realized that while some of the float has to be kept in cash to meet immediate obligations to policyholders, some could also be deployed in higher-yielding investments. And that's what they did.
I'll pause here to say that what works for Berkshire Hathaway does not work for the average investor with a long-term perspective. If you lack the resources of Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger you're probably better off keeping your money in broad-market index funds, riding the market up and down, and staying fully invested in stocks and bonds rather than trying to time the market by holding cash in reserve.
That said, I think the life lesson of protecting yourself from huge losses so you can stay in the game applies to everyone. Early last month I told Mark Spitznagel, the founder and chief investment officer of Universa Investments, that I was due to interview Munger. His eyes lit up. He is a huge admirer of Munger and Buffett.
This says something because Berkshire Hathaway is old school in a lot of ways. It owns Geico and BNSF Railway, among other large companies, and has big stakes in the likes of Apple, Bank of America, American Express, Coca-Cola and Chevron. Universa, meanwhile, is a Miami-based investment management firm with an edgy strategy of "tail risk hedging," which produces blockbuster results when markets fall sharply. (I wrote about Spitznagel two years ago.)
Spitznagel said that Berkshire Hathaway's cash pile serves the same function for that company as Universa's strategy of using financial instruments to insure portfolios against losses: It turns crashes into opportunities. "They have dry powder when they need it and when it is most valuable, when the market is down," he said.
This gets back to lollapaloozas. Let's say there's a strategy that has a 60 percent chance of giving you a huge win and a 40 percent chance of losing badly. If you could play that game 100 times and average your winnings, you'd do great (especially when that dry powder allows you to buy during the fire sales 40 percent of the time). But you have only one shot, so you should pass on the opportunity. Focus instead on building wealth over the long term by minimizing those bad lollapaloozas to "protect your capital base from which you compound each period," as Mark Spitznagel says. And reinvest your gains. Eliminating really big losses gives compounding -- i.e., reinvestment of gains -- a chance to work its magic.
"Poor Charlie's Almanack" cites Munger as having said, "'Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world' (Einstein); never interrupt it unnecessarily." There's no evidence that Einstein actually said the part about the eighth wonder, but Munger definitely did say the part about not interrupting it unnecessarily. I wish I'd been able to ask him about it.
Elsewhere: Fewer Job Openings
The rate of job openings fell in October to its lowest level since February 2021, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released on Tuesday. That's a sign the labor market is cooling off. The rate of layoffs and discharges remains low (1 percent in October), but when people do lose a job, it's harder to find another. That's apparent in claims for unemployment insurance. Initial claims for unemployment insurance rose only 2 percent over the 12 months through Nov. 25, but continued claims (by people who remain out of work) rose 24 percent in the 12 months through Nov. 18, according to the Employment and Training Administration.
Quote of the Day
"Just as economies can reap economic gains by specializing in what they are relatively good at, the world can reap environmental gains if economies specialize in activities that they are relatively green at."
-- Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director general of the World Trade Organization, foreword to "Trade Policy Tools for Climate Action" (Dec. 2, 2023)

How Money, Ego and Fear Lit A.I.'s Fuse: [Series]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Elon Musk celebrated his 44th birthday in July 2015 at a three-day party thrown by his wife at a California wine country resort dotted with cabins. It was family and friends only, with children racing around the upscale property in Napa Valley.
This was years before Twitter became X and Tesla had a profitable year. Mr. Musk and his wife, Talulah Riley -- an actress who played a beautiful but dangerous robot on HBO's science fiction series "Westworld" -- were a year from throwing in the towel on their second marriage. Larry Page, a party guest, was still the chief executive of Google. And artificial intelligence had pierced the public consciousness only a few years before, when it was used to identify cats on YouTube -- with 16 percent accuracy.
A.I. was the big topic of conversation when Mr. Musk and Mr. Page sat down near a firepit beside a swimming pool after dinner the first night. The two billionaires had been friends for more than a decade, and Mr. Musk sometimes joked that he occasionally crashed on Mr. Page's sofa after a night playing video games.
But the tone that clear night soon turned contentious as the two debated whether artificial intelligence would ultimately elevate humanity or destroy it.
As the discussion stretched into the chilly hours, it grew intense, and some of the more than 30 partyers gathered closer to listen. Mr. Page, hampered for more than a decade by an unusual ailment in his vocal cords, described his vision of a digital utopia in a whisper. Humans would eventually merge with artificially intelligent machines, he said. One day there would be many kinds of intelligence competing for resources, and the best would win.
If that happens, Mr. Musk said, we're doomed. The machines will destroy humanity.
With a rasp of frustration, Mr. Page insisted his utopia should be pursued. Finally he called Mr. Musk a "specieist," a person who favors humans over the digital life-forms of the future.
That insult, Mr. Musk said later, was "the last straw."
Many in the crowd seemed gobsmacked, if amused, as they dispersed for the night, and considered it just another one of those esoteric debates that often break out at Silicon Valley parties.
But eight years later, the argument between the two men seems prescient. The question of whether artificial intelligence will elevate the world or destroy it -- or at least inflict grave damage -- has framed an ongoing debate among Silicon Valley founders, chatbot users, academics, legislators and regulators about whether the technology should be controlled or set free.
That debate has pitted some of the world's richest men against one another: Mr. Musk, Mr. Page, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, the tech investor Peter Thiel, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Sam Altman of OpenAI. All have fought for a piece of the business -- which one day could be worth trillions of dollars -- and the power to shape it.
At the heart of this competition is a brain-stretching paradox. The people who say they are most worried about A.I. are among the most determined to create it and enjoy its riches. They have justified their ambition with their strong belief that they alone can keep A.I. from endangering Earth.
Mr. Musk and Mr. Page stopped speaking soon after the party that summer. A few weeks later, Mr. Musk dined with Mr. Altman, who was then running a tech incubator, and several researchers in a private room at the Rosewood hotel in Menlo Park, Calif., a favored deal-making spot close to the venture capital offices of Sand Hill Road.
That dinner led to the creation of a start-up called OpenAI later in the year. Backed by hundreds of millions of dollars from Mr. Musk and other funders, the lab promised to protect the world from Mr. Page's vision.
Thanks to its ChatGPT chatbot, OpenAI has fundamentally changed the technology industry and has introduced the world to the risks and potential of artificial intelligence. OpenAI is valued at more than $ 80 billion, according to two people familiar with the company's latest funding round, though Mr. Musk and Mr. Altman's partnership didn't make it. The two have since stopped speaking.
"There is disagreement, mistrust, egos," Mr. Altman said. "The closer people are to being pointed in the same direction, the more contentious the disagreements are. You see this in sects and religious orders. There are bitter fights between the closest people."
Last month, that infighting came to OpenAI's boardroom. Rebel board members tried to force out Mr. Altman because, they believed, they could no longer trust him to build A.I. that would benefit humanity. Over five chaotic days OpenAI looked as if it were going to fall apart, until the board -- pressured by giant investors and employees who threatened to follow Mr. Altman out the door -- backed down.
The drama inside OpenAI gave the world its first glimpse of the bitter feuds among those who will determine the future of A.I.
But years before OpenAI's near meltdown, there was a little-publicized but ferocious competition in Silicon Valley for control of the technology that is now quickly reshaping the world, from how children are taught to how wars are fought. The New York Times spoke with more than 80 executives, scientists and entrepreneurs, including two people who attended Mr. Musk's birthday party in 2015, to tell that story of ambition, fear and money.
The Birth of DeepMind
Five years before the Napa Valley party and two before the cat breakthrough on YouTube, Demis Hassabis, a 34-year-old neuroscientist, walked into a cocktail party at Peter Thiel's San Francisco townhouse and realized he'd hit pay dirt. There in Mr. Thiel's living room, overlooking the city's Palace of Fine Arts and a swan pond, was a chess board. Dr. Hassabis had once been the second-best player in the world in the under-14 category.
"I was preparing for that meeting for a year," Dr. Hassabis said. "I thought that would be my unique hook in: I knew that he loved chess."
In 2010, Dr. Hassabis and two colleagues, who all lived in Britain, were looking for money to start building "artificial general intelligence," or A.G.I., a machine that could do anything the brain could do. At the time, few people were interested in A.I. After a half century of research, the artificial intelligence field had failed to deliver anything remotely close to the human brain.
Still, some scientists and thinkers had become fixated on the downsides of A.I. Many, like the three young men from Britain, had a connection to Eliezer Yudkowsky, an internet philosopher and self-taught A.I. researcher. Mr. Yudkowsky was a leader in a community of people who called themselves Rationalists or, in later years, effective altruists.
They believed that A.I. could find a cure for cancer or solve climate change, but they worried that A.I. bots might do things their creators had not intended. If the machines became more intelligent than humans, the Rationalists argued, the machines could turn on their creators.
Mr. Thiel had become enormously wealthy through an early investment in Facebook and through his work with Mr. Musk in the early days of PayPal. He had developed a fascination with the singularity, a trope of science fiction that describes the moment when intelligent technology can no longer be controlled by humanity.
With funding from Mr. Thiel, Mr. Yudkowsky had expanded his A.I. lab and created an annual conference on the singularity. Years before, one of Dr. Hassabis's two colleagues had met Mr. Yudkowsky, and he snagged them speaking spots at the conference, ensuring they'd be invited to Mr. Thiel's party.
Mr. Yudkowsky introduced Dr. Hassabis to Mr. Thiel. Dr. Hassabis assumed that lots of people at the party would be trying to squeeze their host for money. His strategy was to arrange another meeting. There was a deep tension between the bishop and the knight, he told Mr. Thiel. The two pieces carried the same value, but the best players understood that their strengths were vastly different.
It worked. Charmed, Mr. Thiel invited the group back the next day, where they gathered in the kitchen. Their host had just finished his morning workout and was still sweating in a shiny tracksuit. A butler handed him a Diet Coke. The three made their pitch, and soon Mr. Thiel and his venture capital firm agreed to put 1.4 million British pounds (roughly $ 2.25 million) into their start-up. He was their first major investor.
They named their company DeepMind, a nod to "deep learning," a way for A.I. systems to learn skills by analyzing large amounts of data; to neuroscience; and to the Deep Thought supercomputer from the sci-fi novel "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." By the fall of 2010, they were building their dream machine. They wholeheartedly believed that because they understood the risks, they were uniquely positioned to protect the world.
"I don't see this as a contradictory position," said Mustafa Suleyman, one of the three DeepMind founders. "There are huge benefits to come from these technologies. The goal is not to eliminate them or pause their development. The goal is to mitigate the downsides."
Having won over Mr. Thiel, Dr. Hassabis worked his way into Mr. Musk's orbit. About two years later, they met at a conference organized by Mr. Thiel's investment fund, which had also put money into Mr. Musk's company SpaceX. Dr. Hassabis secured a tour of SpaceX headquarters. Afterward, with rocket hulls hanging from the ceiling, the two men lunched in the cafeteria and talked.
Mr. Musk explained that his plan was to colonize Mars to escape overpopulation and other dangers on Earth. Dr. Hassabis replied that the plan would work -- so long as superintelligent machines didn't follow and destroy humanity on Mars, too.
Mr. Musk was speechless. He hadn't thought about that particular danger. Mr. Musk soon invested in DeepMind alongside Mr. Thiel so he could be closer to the creation of this technology.
Flush with cash, DeepMind hired researchers who specialized in neural networks, complex algorithms created in the image of the human brain. A neural network is essentially a giant mathematical system that spends days, weeks or even months identifying patterns in large amounts of digital data. First developed in the 1950s, these systems could learn to handle tasks on their own. After analyzing names and addresses scribbled on hundreds of envelopes, for instance, they could read handwritten text.
DeepMind took the concept further. It built a system that could learn to play classic Atari games like Space Invaders, Pong and Breakout to illustrate what was possible.
This got the attention of another Silicon Valley powerhouse, Google, and specifically Larry Page. He saw a demonstration of Deep Mind's machine playing Atari games. He wanted in.
The Talent Auction
In the fall of 2012, Geoffrey Hinton, a 64-year-old professor at the University of Toronto, and two graduate students published a research paper that showed the world what A.I. could do. They trained a neural network to recognize common objects like flowers, dogs and cars.
Scientists were surprised by the accuracy of the technology built by Dr. Hinton and his students. One who took particular notice was Yu Kai, an A.I. researcher who had met Dr. Hinton at a research conference and had recently started working for Baidu, the giant Chinese internet company. Baidu offered Dr. Hinton and his students $ 12 million to join the company in Beijing, according to three people familiar with the offer.
Dr. Hinton turned Baidu down, but the money got his attention.
The Cambridge-educated British expatriate had spent most of his career in academia, except for occasional stints at Microsoft and Google, and was not especially driven by money. But he had a neurodivergent child, and the money would mean financial security.
"We did not know how much we were worth," Dr. Hinton said. He consulted lawyers and experts on acquisitions and came up with a plan: "We would organize an auction, and we would sell ourselves." The auction would take place during an annual A.I. conference at the Harrah's hotel and casino on Lake Tahoe.
Big Tech took notice. Google, Microsoft, Baidu and other companies were beginning to believe that neural networks were a path to machines that could not only see, but hear, write, talk and -- eventually -- think.
Mr. Page had seen similar technology at Google Brain, his company's A.I. lab, and he thought Dr. Hinton's research could elevate his scientists' work. He gave Alan Eustace, Google's senior vice president of engineering, what amounted to a blank check to hire any A.I. expertise he needed.
Mr. Eustace and Jeff Dean, who led the Brain lab, flew to Lake Tahoe and took Dr. Hinton and his students out to dinner at a steakhouse inside the hotel the night before the auction. The smell of old cigarettes was overpowering, Dr. Dean recalled. They made the case for coming to work at Google.
The next day, Dr. Hinton ran the auction from his hotel room. Because of an old back injury, he rarely sat down. He turned a trash can upside down on a table, put his laptop on top and watched the bids roll in over the next two days.
Google made an offer. So did Microsoft. DeepMind quickly bowed out as the price went up. The industry giants pushed the bids to $ 20 million and then $ 25 million, according to documents detailing the auction. As the price passed $ 30 million, Microsoft quit, but it rejoined the bidding at $ 37 million.
"We felt like we were in a movie," Dr. Hinton said.
Then Microsoft dropped out a second time. Only Baidu and Google were left, and they pushed the bidding to $ 42 million, $ 43 million. Finally, at $ 44 million, Dr. Hinton and his students stopped the auction. The bids were still climbing, but they wanted to work for Google. And the money was staggering.
It was an unmistakable sign that deep-pocketed companies were determined to buy the most talented A.I. researchers -- which was not lost on Dr. Hassabis at DeepMind. He had always told his employees that DeepMind would remain an independent company. That was, he believed, the best way to ensure its technology didn't turn into something dangerous.
But as Big Tech entered the talent race, he decided he had no choice: It was time to sell.
By the end of 2012, Google and Facebook were angling to acquire the London lab, according to three people familiar with the matter. Dr. Hassabis and his co-founders insisted on two conditions: No DeepMind technology could be used for military purposes, and its A.G.I. technology must be overseen by an independent board of technologists and ethicists.
Google offered $ 650 million. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook offered a bigger payout to DeepMind's founders, but would not agree to the conditions. DeepMind sold to Google.
Mr. Zuckerberg was determined to build an A.I. lab of his own. He hired Yann LeCun, a French computer scientist who had also done pioneering A.I. research, to run it. A year after Dr. Hinton's auction, Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. LeCun flew to Lake Tahoe for the same A.I. conference. While padding around a suite at the Harrah's casino in his socks, Mr. Zuckerberg personally interviewed top researchers, who were soon offered millions of dollars in salary and stock.
A.I. was once laughed off. Now the richest men in Silicon Valley were shelling out billions to keep from being left behind.
The Lost Ethics Board
When Mr. Musk invested in DeepMind, he broke his own informal rule -- that he would not invest in any company he didn't run himself. The downsides of his decision were already apparent when, only a month or so after his birthday spat with Mr. Page, he again found himself face to face with his former friend and fellow billionaire.
The occasion was the first meeting of DeepMind's ethics board, on Aug. 14, 2015. The board had been set up at the insistence of the start-up's founders to ensure that their technology did no harm after the sale. The members convened in a conference room just outside Mr. Musk's office at SpaceX, with a window looking out onto his rocket factory, according to three people familiar with the meeting.
But that's where Mr. Musk's control ended. When Google bought DeepMind, it bought the whole thing. Mr. Musk was out. Financially he had come out ahead, but he was unhappy.
Three Google executives now firmly in control of DeepMind were there: Mr. Page; Sergey Brin, a Google co-founder and Tesla investor; and Eric Schmidt, Google's chairman. Among the other attendees were Reid Hoffman, another PayPal founder, and Toby Ord, an Australian philosopher studying "existential risk."
The DeepMind founders reported that they were pushing ahead with their work, but that they were aware the technology carried serious risks.
Mr. Suleyman, the DeepMind co-founder, gave a presentation called "The Pitchforkers Are Coming." A.I. could lead to an explosion in disinformation, he told the board. He fretted that as the technology replaced countless jobs in the coming years, the public would accuse Google of stealing their livelihoods. Google would need to share its wealth with the millions who could no longer find work and provide a "universal basic income," he argued.
Mr. Musk agreed. But it was pretty clear that his Google guests were not prepared to embark on a redistribution of (their) wealth. Mr. Schmidt said he thought the worries were completely overblown. In his usual whisper, Mr. Page agreed. A.I. would create more jobs than it took away, he argued.
Eight months later, DeepMind had a breakthrough that stunned the A.I community and the world. A DeepMind machine called AlphaGo beat one of the world's best players at the ancient game of Go. The game, streamed over the internet, was watched by 200 million people across the globe. Most researchers had assumed that A.I. needed another 10 years to muster the ingenuity to do that.
Rationalists, effective altruists and others who worried about the risks of A.I. claimed the computer's win validated their fears.
"This is another indication that A.I. is progressing faster than even many experts anticipated," Victoria Krakovna, who would soon join DeepMind as an "A.I. safety" researcher, wrote in a blog post.
DeepMind's founders were increasingly worried about what Google would do with their inventions. In 2017, they tried to break away from the company. Google responded by increasing the salaries and stock award packages of the DeepMind founders and their staff. They stayed put.
The ethics board never had a second meeting.
The Breakup
Convinced that Mr. Page's optimistic view of A.I. was dead wrong, and angry at his loss of DeepMind, Mr. Musk built his own lab.
OpenAI was founded in late 2015, just a few months after he met with Sam Altman at the Rosewood hotel in Silicon Valley. Mr. Musk pumped money into the lab, and his former PayPal buddies, Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Thiel, came along for the ride. The three men and others pledged to put $ 1 billion into the project, which Mr. Altman, who was 30 at the time, would help run. To get them started, they poached Ilya Sutskever from Google. (Dr. Sutskever was one of the graduate students Google "bought" in Dr. Hinton's auction.)
Initially, Mr. Musk wanted to operate OpenAI as a nonprofit, free from the economic incentives that were driving Google and other corporations. But by the time Google wowed the tech community with its Go stunt, Mr. Musk was changing his mind about how it should be run. He desperately wanted OpenAI to invent something that would capture the world's imagination and close the gap with Google, but it wasn't getting the job done as a nonprofit.
In late 2017, he hatched a plan to wrest control of the lab from Mr. Altman and the other founders and transform it into a commercial operation that would join forces with Tesla and rely on supercomputers the car company was developing, according to four people familiar with the matter.
When Mr. Altman and others pushed back, Mr. Musk quit and said he would focus on his own A.I. work at Tesla. In February 2018, he announced his departure to OpenAI's staff on the top floor of the start-up's offices in a converted truck factory, three people who attended the meeting said. When he said that OpenAI needed to move faster, one researcher retorted at the meeting that Mr. Musk was being reckless.
Mr. Musk called the researcher a "jackass" and stormed out, taking his deep pockets with him.
OpenAI suddenly needed new financing in a hurry. Mr. Altman flew to Sun Valley for a conference and ran into Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive. A tie-up seemed natural. Mr. Altman knew Microsoft's chief technology officer, Kevin Scott. Microsoft had bought LinkedIn from Mr. Hoffman, an OpenAI board member. Mr. Nadella told Mr. Scott to get it done. The deal closed in 2019.
Mr. Altman and OpenAI had formed a for-profit company under the original nonprofit, they had $ 1 billion in fresh capital, and Microsoft had a new way to build artificial intelligence into its vast cloud computing service.
Not everyone inside OpenAI was happy.
Dario Amodei, a researcher with ties to the effective altruist community, had been on hand at the Rosewood hotel when OpenAI was born. Dr. Amodei, who endlessly twisted his curls between his fingers as he talked, was leading the lab's efforts to build a neural network called a large language model that could learn from enormous amounts of digital text. By analyzing countless Wikipedia articles, digital books and message boards, it could generate text on its own. It also had the unfortunate habit of making things up. It was called GPT-3, and it was released in the summer of 2020.
Researchers inside OpenAI, Google and other companies thought this rapidly improving technology could be a path to A.G.I.
But Dr. Amodei was unhappy about the Microsoft deal because he thought it was taking OpenAI in a really commercial direction. He and other researchers went to the board to try to push Mr. Altman out, according to five people familiar with the matter. After they failed, they left. Like DeepMind's founders before them, they worried that their new corporate overlords would favor commercial interests over safety.
In 2021, the group of about 15 engineers and scientists created a new lab called Anthropic. The plan was to build A.I. the way the effective altruists thought it should done -- with very tight controls.
"There was no attempt to remove Sam Altman from OpenAI by the co-founders of Anthropic," said an Anthropic spokeswoman, Sally Aldous. "The co-founders themselves came to the conclusion that they wished to depart OpenAI to start their own company, made this known to OpenAI's leadership, and over several weeks negotiated an exit on mutually agreeable terms."
Anthropic accepted a $ 4 billion investment from Amazon and another $ 2 billion from Google two years later.
The Reveal
After OpenAI received another $ 2 billion from Microsoft, Mr. Altman and another senior executive, Greg Brockman, visited Bill Gates at his sprawling mansion on the shores of Lake Washington, outside Seattle. The Microsoft founder was no longer involved in the company day to day but kept in regular touch with its executives.
Over dinner, Mr. Gates told them he doubted that large language models could work. He would stay skeptical, he said, until the technology performed a task that required critical thinking -- passing an A.P. biology test, for instance.
Five months later, on Aug. 24, 2022, Mr. Altman and Mr. Brockman returned and brought along an OpenAI researcher named Chelsea Voss. Ms. Voss had been a medalist in an international biology Olympiad as a high schooler. Mr. Nadella and other Microsoft executives were there, too.
On a huge digital display on a stand outside Mr. Gates's living room, the OpenAI crew presented a technology called GPT-4.
Mr. Brockman gave the system a multiple-choice advanced biology test, and Ms. Voss graded the answers. The first question involved polar molecules, groups of atoms with a positive charge at one end and a negative charge at the other. The system answered correctly and explained its choice. "It was only trained to provide an answer," Mr. Brockman said. "The conversational nature kind of fell out, almost magically." In other words, it was doing things they hadn't really designed it to do.
There were 60 questions. GPT-4 got only one answer wrong.
Mr. Gates sat up in his chair, his eyes opened wide. In 1980, he had a similar reaction when researchers showed him the graphical user interface that became the basis for the modern personal computer. He thought GPT was that revolutionary.
By October, Microsoft was adding the technology across its online services, including its Bing search engine. And two months later OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot, which is now used by 100 million people every week.
OpenAI had beat the effective altruists at Anthropic. Mr. Page's optimists at Google scurried to release their own chatbot, Bard, but were widely perceived to have lost the race to OpenAI. Three months after ChatGPT's release, Google stock was down 11 percent. Mr. Musk was nowhere to be found.
But it was just the beginning.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" has been a holiday staple for 65 years. But Lee, who recorded it at 13, has never rested on her laurels.
On a balmy day 65 years ago, a 13-year-old girl walked into a Nashville recording studio decorated with colored lights, garlands and a Christmas tree, the air conditioning cranked up to approximate a late-December chill. Members of the A Team, the session musicians who churned out hits for everyone in town, gamely donned Santa hats.
As she had many times before, the young singer laid down a raspy rockabilly vocal way beyond her years, then packed up and went home, hardly imagining that the result would outlive most of the people in the room.
"I would've never thought in my wildest dreams that 'Rockin' would be my signature song," Brenda Lee said on a recent afternoon in her wood-paneled Nashville house, which is filled with gold and platinum record plaques and personalized memorabilia. To Lee, the song is just "Rockin'." Always. Only a crimson pillow in her living room is embroidered with its full title: "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree."
As if frozen at the precocious age when she became famous, Lee, now 78, still stands at a diminutive 4'9" -- maybe 4'11" with the hair -- and wears a size 2½ shoe. (She shops in the children's footwear section, or brings an empty suitcase to fill when she's in Thailand, the only place she's found adult shoes that fit.) Clad in a sequined red pantsuit, her petite frame immersed in an oversized leather chair, Lee sipped a Diet Coke ("I'm addicted") and reminisced about her Christmas classic that even after her retirement, is still climbing the charts. "I think I'm making more now than I did when I was singing," she said, and laughed.
Johnny Marks -- who penned Christmas classics including "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" and "Holly Jolly Christmas" -- wrote "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" with Lee in mind. She was a child prodigy whose explosive vocal talent had earned the nickname "Little Miss Dynamite." When he sent her a demo, she was extra impressed because Marks was Jewish.
"I said, 'Johnny! You don't even believe in Christmas! How did you write this song?,"' she recounted. On a recent vacation, he explained, he'd been lying on a beach and was mesmerized by distant trees swaying in the ocean breeze. It almost seemed like they were ... rocking. And unto us, a Christmas standard was born.
Not that it was an immediate success. "Rockin"' arrived in 1958, but failed to make waves. Then in 1960, after Lee had her first No. 1 hit with the wrenching ballad "I'm Sorry," her label, Decca Records, attempted to capitalize on her newfound popularity and rerelease her Christmas tune. It worked: The song hit No. 14 that holiday season, and throughout the '60s it continued to chart in December.
Prominent placement in the hit 1990 movie "Home Alone" introduced the song to a new generation. In more recent years, thanks to streaming, back-catalog Christmas music has become more lucrative than ever, and Lee's tune -- along with newer holiday standards like "Last Christmas" and "All I Want for Christmas Is You" -- has made annual appearances on the Billboard Hot 100.
"She is living proof of how important you can be and how long you can last if you're talented and you work hard and you truly love people," the country singer Tanya Tucker said in an email. Lee inducted Tucker into the Country Music Hall of Fame in October, and people are still talking about the dry delivery and killer comic timing of her speech. Lee has, Tucker added, "the best sense of humor known to man (or woman)."
For the past four years, "Rockin"' has peaked at No. 2, but in honor of its 65th anniversary, Lee's label is giving the song an extra push, including a new music video that features Lee lip-syncing to the tune she recorded as a teen, and even a TikTok account. Only one woman and her whistle register seem to stand in the way of this decades-old song hitting No. 1.
"Now I gotta worry about Mariah," Lee said with a feisty laugh. "Get outta here, girl!" Growing more serious, she added, "Oh, there's room for everybody. Her song's good, too. I love her singing."
Lee and Carey have never met, but they would certainly have a lot to talk about -- like how it feels to have a groundbreaking, history-making career reduced in the popular imagination to a seasonal novelty. Because while Brenda Lee is a Christmas queen, she's also so much more.
A LOT OF PEOPLE have stories. Brenda Lee has stories. She first met Elvis Presley in 1957 ("He was the pretty Elvis then") when she was 12, the night she made her Grand Ole Opry debut; he was watching in the wings. "I'm never star-struck by anyone, and I've met the biggest," she said. "But I was tongue-tied when I met him."
Patsy Cline was her early tour mate and mentor ("a good old broad, in the nicest sense of the word"). While still in her teens, Lee shared bills with Little Richard, Chubby Checker, Dusty Springfield -- the list is seemingly endless. In 1962, at the peak of her worldwide popularity, while in Hamburg on tour, the Beatles opened for her. "They were raw musically," she said, "but they were fabulous." The admiration was mutual: Years later, in a Rolling Stone interview, John Lennon declared that Lee "has the greatest rock 'n' roll voice of them all."
She's still not quite sure where that voice came from. "I ask myself that sometimes," she mused. "It's just how I sing." Raised poor ("you spell that 'p-o-o-o-o-r,' with four o's," she wrote in her 2002 autobiography) in the red clay of east Georgia, Brenda Mae Tarpley was born on Dec. 11, 1944. By age 3 she was standing on the counter at the general store, singing for change, and by 7 performing Hank Williams tunes on Atlanta TV.
She was a preternaturally quick study, picking up the hiccuping vocal style she heard Williams use on the radio as well as the growl of a bluesman who played around town, blending them into a unique style made even more remarkable by the fact it was coming out of the mouth of a girl who looked and dressed like Shirley Temple. Lee got her national break at 11, performing "Jambalaya" on the popular "Ozark Jubilee"; a recording contract with Decca soon followed. Her debut single billed her as "Little Brenda Lee (9 years old)." "Apparently," Lee wrote, "being 11 wasn't dramatic enough."
By then, though, Lee was already the family's sole breadwinner. When she was 8, her construction-worker father died after a hammer dropped on his head. To support her mother and two siblings, she developed a tireless work ethic, booking countless studio sessions and touring relentlessly. "We went by car and I slept up in the back window, that's how little I was," she said. "I just loved it so much that I didn't mind the hardship. And I was young."
Lee's voice was nimble: She could excite teenagers with rockabilly hits like "Sweet Nothin's" -- Presley's favorite Lee song, which was many years later sampled by Kanye West -- and win over their parents by crooning ballads like "Emotions." Her ability to straddle the worlds of pop, rock and country made her a constant fixture on the hit parade. Lee had the fourth most chart hits in the 1960s (47), surpassed only by Elvis, the Beatles and Ray Charles. She was the first woman to be inducted into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.
Lee was also one of the first American pop stars to find an international audience. At the time, she said, most artists didn't want to give up domestic tour dates. Lee realized how shortsighted that approach was the first time she went to Japan and was greeted by a crowd holding "BLFC" signs: "Brenda Lee Fan Club." She returned 31 more times. "They love you if you'll come," she said, sitting beside a sepia-toned globe several times larger than her head. "All they ask is that you come, and I loved to go."
Lee's house is cluttered with souvenirs from her travels and mementos from her peers. A sketch by Elton John sits on the piano, alongside a close-up photograph of Keith Richards's hand, skull rings and all ("because it's so distinct," Lee said, adding, "He loves me. He's a fun guy, too."). Cyndi Lauper -- an acolyte Lee particularly admires -- once visited and left her lipstick in the bathroom. "And I've still got it," Lee said, and giggled mischievously. "I'm Hector the Collector. Like the Shel Silverstein book. That's just me."
IN 1961, LEE booked a three-week stint headlining Las Vegas's Sahara Hotel. The previous headliner had been her idol, Judy Garland, and when Lee arrived, she approached Garland as she was lounging by the pool. Lee still remembers the encounter vividly: "I said, 'Miss Garland?' And she looked up and I said, 'Uh, my name is Brenda Lee and I'm an artist and I love you."' Lee asked Garland if she had any showbiz advice. "She took those sunglasses off and she looked at me and she never faltered. And she said, 'Don't let anyone take your childhood."'
Lee credits the support of those around her for helping her avoid the tragic fate of so many child stars. "I had people that cared about me," she said, like her longtime manager Dub Allbritten. "He respected my wishes." She continued to attend high school in Nashville when she could, and if something came up on her social calendar -- "so-and-so's graduation party" -- Allbritten would let her prioritize that over the road. That autonomy was important to her. "I didn't do that very often," Lee said. "But I knew I could."
And then there's Ronnie Shackett, the impossibly tall guy she once spied across the aisle at a Jackie Wilson concert. Lee passed him a note: "Hi, my name's Brenda, here's my number. But I'm going to be gone for three months in Europe, working." When she got back, he called. "Sometimes it works," she said. They married in 1963.
Midway through our conversation, Shackett walked through the living room. "Fifty-seven years," Lee marveled.
"It's more than that, Brenda," Shackett said. "We had a daughter in '64."
"I guess it is more than that," Lee said. She paused for a moment to do the math and then clapped her hands in delight. "Sixty years! Lord. And he's a good man. I lucked out."
When Lee thinks back on her days recording with Bradley and the A Team, she mourns a version of the industry that doesn't exist anymore. "I miss all of them that are gone tremendously because they were my friends," she said. She can't believe what often passes for a session in the digital age. "It just seems like now, you don't even see the musicians," she said. "You go in and sing to a track. The musicians always gave me my energy."
"There's no standards being written today," Lee added. "And that hurts me, 'cause I go back to the '60s all the time and listen to those songs. They're still played all the time, 'cause they were good. They were done with people that loved what they did."
Still, she added, there's plenty of talent in Nashville today -- "it's oozing" -- and she's just glad she doesn't have to compete with it. Despite the renewed attention to "Rockin,"' Lee retired from singing publicly in 2020. "God has blessed me that I don't miss it," she said. "I love to sing, but I can get that out of my system right here. I can go in the shower and sing. Good acoustics."
She admitted that there's nothing like the thrill of singing before a crowd, trying to win over the skeptics. But she's traded that in for something else. "I can finally put my kids and my grandkids and my friends first," she said. "For once, I'm here to see them."
After 65 years of traveling the world, Lee has earned her rest. That's not to say she won't break out into an impromptu tune now and then; she recently went viral for surprising passengers by singing "Rockin"' on a plane intercom. Just don't expect to see her on the road. "If somebody said, 'Brenda, we're coming to get you in the bus,"' she said in no uncertain terms, "I'd say, 'Oh, no you're not."'

Full text: His camera could freeze moments in history, but he also had an eye for the humor and absurdity of everyday life. Dogs were a help there.
Photographers with a comic outlook on life seldom win the acclaim granted to exalters of nature or chroniclers of war and squalor. Elliott Erwitt, who died at 95 on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan, was an exception.
For more than six decades he used his camera to tell visual jokes, finding material wherever he strolled. His sharp eye for silly, sometimes telling conjunctions -- a dog lying on its back in a cemetery, a glowing Coca-Cola machine amid a public display of missiles in Alabama, a mangy potted plant in a tacky Miami Beach ballroom -- earned him constant assignments as well as the affection of a public that shared his sweet, Chaplin-esque sense of the absurd.
He published more than 20 books, and his black-and-white prints are in photography collections throughout the world. His daughter Sasha Erwitt confirmed the death.
Most celebrated for his witty snapshots of dogs, published in books with titles like "Son of Bitch," "To the Dogs," and "Woof," Mr. Erwitt captured them as solitary animals with their own obsessions as well as personable interactors with humans.
In an essay for Mr. Erwitt's "Dogs Dogs," P.G. Wodehouse wrote: "There's not a sitter in his gallery who does not melt the heart, and no beastly class distinctions, either. Thoroughbreds and mutts, they are all here."
The popularity of Mr. Erwitt's canine candids obscured the diversity of his work. He never specialized and always freelanced. A lifelong member and one-time president of Magnum, the esteemed collective of independent photographers -- a co-founder, Robert Capa, invited him to join in 1953 -- Mr. Erwitt took all kinds of assignments, from fashion to politics
He photographed celebrities (Humphrey Bogart, Jack Kerouac, Marilyn Monroe, Che Guevara) for Life, Look, and other magazines, and he did travel campaigns for Ireland and France.
A number of his images became famous. One of his most well known shows a veiled Jacqueline Kennedy holding a folded American flag during President John F. Kennedy's burial at Arlington National Cemetery in 1963.
Even better-known is one from 1959, of Vice President Richard M. Nixon poking Soviet Premier Nikita S. Krushchev in the chest during the so-called Kitchen Debate in a Moscow exhibition of American products. (The picture was turned into a poster by Republicans in the 1960 campaign, enraging the staunchly anti-Nixon Mr. Erwitt. "It was used without my permission," he later said. "I was angry, but I couldn't do anything about it.")
Another memorable photograph, from Edward Steichen's landmark photo exhibition "The Family of Man" (and subsequent book) at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, was titled "Mother and Child." Taken in 1953, it shows a woman on a bed looking into her baby's eyes while a cat coolly surveys the scene. The baby was Mr. Erwitt's daughter, Ellen, and the woman was his first wife, Lucienne Matthews, who died in 2011.
Museums exhibited his work from the 1960s until his death, and over the years he received one-man shows at the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Modern Art in Paris and the Barbican in London. In 2002, a comprehensive retrospective was mounted at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid.
Elio Romano Ervitz ("Romano, because my father had once attended the University of Rome" and "liked it") was born on July 26, 1928, in Paris, the son of a Russian Orthodox Jew (there were many Talmudic scholars in his family) and his Russian wife. They had fled to France after the 1917 Revolution.
In an autobiographical essay in his book "Personal Exposures" (1988), Mr. Erwitt wrote that his father, Boris, had never lost faith in socialism and had blamed his wife, Eugenia (Trepel) Erwitt ("embarrassingly rich as a young girl"), for the couple's exodus from "the Promised Land of the Soviet Paradise."
After moving the family to Italy, his father found Mussolini's regime intolerable and shuttled everyone back to France in 1938. Although Boris and Eugenia had separated in Milan when their son was 4, the three left together on a boat for the United States a year later, a few days before World War II began.
Elio Ervitz became Elliott Erwitt in New York but continued his peripatetic life. After two years living with his salesman father on Central Park West in Manhattan, father and son drove across country to Los Angeles in 1941, the two selling wristwatches in small towns en route to pay their way.
A few years later, his father was off again, this time selling his wares in New Orleans and leaving his 16-year-old son to fend for himself. Boris later traveled to Japan to be ordained as a Buddhist priest and returned to practice his adopted religion in Manhattan.
Mr. Erwitt credited "shyness" -- he had arrived in New York speaking no English -- with making him a photographer. He began seriously taking pictures in Los Angeles with an antique glass-plate camera when he was 16, then upgraded to a Rolleiflex.
"My dentist was my first customer, then people's houses and children, then the senior prom," he wrote. Photos of movie stars also sold well.
After graduating from Hollywood High School, he studied photography at Los Angeles City College, took a job in a commercial dark room and hustled for work. In 1949, he headed back to New York, where he met Capa and Steichen, studied film at the New School for Social Research and enjoyed a nascent professional career before the Army drafted him during the Korean War.
While serving in 1951 with an Army Signal Corps unit in France, he took a picture of soldiers killing time in the barracks. By his account, the photo changed his life. Submitting it to a Life magazine contest, he won a prize, and the photograph was published as "Bed and Boredom." With the $ 2,500 check ("an astronomical amount at the time"), Mr. Erwitt bought a car and nicknamed it "Thank you, Henry," after the Time-Life publisher, Henry Luce.
The unheroic and the offbeat had already become signature motifs for Mr. Erwitt. He made his first dog-related pictures in 1946, for a fashion story about women's shoes for The New York Times Magazine.
One image from that assignment, of a panting Chihuahua in a sweater on a sidewalk next to a woman in sandals, was featured in many exhibitions.
"I decided to photograph from a dog's point of view because dogs see more shoes than anybody," he reasoned.
Mr. Erwitt tended to use a view camera for advertising jobs while reserving his 35-millimeter for personal shooting. Henri Cartier-Bresson was one of many who were astonished that his friend was so easily able to do both kinds of work.
"Elliott has to my mind achieved a miracle," Mr. Cartier-Bresson once said, "working on a chain-gang of commercial campaigns and still offering a bouquet of stolen photos with a flavor, a smile from his deeper self."
Speaking four languages, a facility that allowed him to find regular work in Europe during the 1950s, '60, and '70s, Mr. Erwitt relished the freelance life.
"Some people can't stand the insecurity, but I've never been overly bothered by it," he wrote in 1988, adding that his unstable income stream was harder on his wives and girlfriends than on him.
Mr. Erwitt was married and divorced four times: to Lucienne Van Kan, from 1953 to 1960; to Diana Dann, from 1967 to 1974; to Susan Ringo, from 1977 to 1984; and to Pia Frankenberg, from 1998 to 2012.
In addition to his daughter Sasha, from his third marriage, he is survived by another daughter from that marriage, Amelia Erwitt; two daughters from his first marriage, Ellen and Jennifer Erwitt; two sons from his first marriage, Misha and David; 10 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. He lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan for about 60 years.
In the 1970s, Mr. Erwitt was among the first to benefit from the art market's interest in contemporary photographs as an investment. Brokers bought prints in bulk for tax shelters. "That windfall bought my house in East Hampton," he said.
"Photographs and Anti-Photographs," published in 1972, was the first in a string of Erwitt books. During this time he also produced and directed a series of short film documentaries: "The Many Faces of Dustin Hoffman" (1968), "Beauty Knows No Pain" (1971), "Red, White and Bluegrass" (1973), "The Glassmakers of Herat, Afghanistan" (1977), and "The Magnificent Marching 100" (1980). He continued making films in the 1980s, producing a series of 18 short comedies for HBO.
But his goofy and agile still photography will undoubtedly be his best-remembered legacy. Along with dogs, nudity tickled him, and he found as much material on public beaches as on the streets. The human comedy activated his eye, even if he was hard-pressed to explain his process of seeing.
"You can take a picture of the most wonderful situation and it's lifeless, nothing comes through," he observed. "Then you can take a picture of nothing, of someone scratching his nose, and it turns out to be a great picture."
The gentle humor of his pictures did not prevent him from maintaining a brusquely anti-intellectual stance toward what he did.
He was wary of interpretation. "In general, I don't think too much," he wrote. "I certainly don't use those funny words museum people and art critics like."
He believed photography was "a lazy man's profession" that required only "modest ability." The mystery of how he did what he did could not be explained, even by himself, and that seemed to please him. He concluded that "ideas, wonderfully entertaining as they can be in conversation and seduction, have little to do with photography."
Richard B. Woodward, a longtime art and photography critic in New York, died in April. Alex Traub contributed reporting.

Charles T. Munger, Buffett's One-of-a-Kind No. 2, Is Dead at 99: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A billionaire himself, he was the witty vice chairman of Mr. Buffett's powerhouse investment firm Berkshire Hathaway. But he had far more influence than his title suggested.
Charles T. Munger, who quit a well-established law career to be Warren E. Buffett's partner and maxim-spouting alter-ego as they transformed a struggling New England textile company into the spectacularly successful investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, died on Tuesday in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 99.
His death, at a hospital, was announced by Berkshire Hathaway. He had a home in Los Angeles.
Although overshadowed by Mr. Buffett, who relished the spotlight, Mr. Munger, a billionaire in his own right -- Forbes listed his fortune as $ 2.6 billion this year -- had far more influence at Berkshire than his title of vice chairman suggested.
Mr. Buffett has described him as the originator of Berkshire Hathaway's investing approach. "The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices," Mr. Buffett once wrote in an annual report.
That investing strategy was a revelation for Mr. Buffett, who had made his name in the 1950s buying troubled companies at deep discounts. (He called them "cigar butts," because investing in them, he said, was like "picking up a discarded cigar butt that had one puff remaining in it.")
Mr. Munger counseled Mr. Buffett that if he wanted to build a large, sustainable company that would outperform other investors, he should buy solid brand-name companies. "He was the architect and I was the general contractor," Mr. Buffett said of their relationship.
The partnership, spanning more than 50 years, produced one of the most successful and largest conglomerates in history. Among other properties, Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, owns the insurance giant Geico and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad company and holds stakes in Coca-Cola, American Express and other corporate heavyweights. By 2022 it had about 372,000 employees.
Mr. Munger, an erudite man who sprinkled his conversations with references to Cicero, Albert Einstein, Mark Twain and Confucius, was widely known for his witty common-sense maxims, so much so that they were called Mungerisms and collected in books, including "Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger" (2005).
"Envy is a really stupid sin," goes one, "because it's the only one you could never possibly have any fun at." Another: "The ethos of not fooling yourself is one of the best you could possibly have. It's powerful because it's so rare."
Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger would talk to each other on the telephone for hours every day, Mr. Buffett from his office in Omaha (their mutual hometown) and Mr. Munger from Los Angeles.
"We've never had an argument," Mr. Buffett said. Repeating one of Mr. Munger's favorite lines, Mr. Buffett said that when they did differ, Mr. Munger would say, "Warren, think it over and you'll agree with me because you're smart and I'm right."
Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger were the faces of Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, what became known as the Woodstock of Capitalism. They would hold forth in front of tens of thousands of rapt Berkshire shareholders, answering questions for up to six hours and dispensing their investment wisdom.
"The trouble with making all these pronouncements is people gradually begin to think they know something," Mr. Munger told the audience in 2015. "It's much better to think you're ignorant." He added, "If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich."
Many of those listeners had become vastly wealthy themselves by investing with Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. A $ 1,000 investment in Berkshire made in 1964 is worth more than $ 10 million today.
Mr. Munger was often viewed as the moral compass of Berkshire Hathaway, advising Mr. Buffett on personnel issues as well as investments. His hiring policy: "Trust first, ability second."
A Lawyer's Son
Charles Thomas Munger was born in Omaha on Jan. 1, 1924, the son of Alfred Case Munger, a lawyer, and Florence (Russell) Munger. As a boy he worked Saturdays in a grocery store then owned by Mr. Buffett's grandfather. (Mr. Buffett worked there for a time himself, but the two did not meet until much later.) At 17, Charles went to the University of Michigan to major in mathematics, but in his sophomore year, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps.
Promoted to second lieutenant, he was dispatched to the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena to train as a meteorologist. In Pasadena he met Nancy Huggins, daughter of a local shoe store owner, and they married, he at 21 and she at 19. They went on to have three children.
Soon he was assigned to Nome, Alaska, where he developed a talent that would serve him well.
"Playing poker in the Army and as a young lawyer honed my business skills," Mr. Munger told Janet Lowe in her 2000 book "Damn Right! Behind the Scenes with Berkshire Hathaway Billionaire Charlie Munger."
"What you have to learn is to fold early when the odds are against you," he said, "or if you have a big edge, back it heavily, because you don't get a big edge often, so seize it when it does come.
Even before his discharge from the Army in 1946, Mr. Munger, who once said he had a black belt in chutzpah, applied to Harvard Law School, from which his father had graduated, even though he had desultory work habits and no undergraduate degree. He was accepted only after intervention by a fellow Nebraskan, Roscoe Pound, a retired dean of the school and a family friend.
Graduating with honors, Mr. Munger returned to California and began practicing law. He eventually struck out on his own by founding the law firm Munger, Tolles & Hills (now Munger, Tolles & Olson). But his life had begun to unravel: He and his wife divorced; their only son, Teddy, died of leukemia at 9 years old; and he suffered financial reverses.
With Mr. Munger practically broke, his daughter Molly complained to him about his beat-up yellow Pontiac. "Daddy, this car is just awful, a mess," she said. "Why do you drive it?" As recounted in Ms. Lowe's biography, he replied, "To discourage gold diggers."
Seeking to rebuild, and drawing on his preternatural math skills ("I always took math courses because I could get an 'A' without doing any work," he said), he began investing on the side, in stocks, businesses and real estate.
"It soon occurred to me that I'd rather be one of our rich and interesting clients than be their lawyer," he said.
His investments generated his first million dollars.
Mr. Munger married Nancy Barry Borthwick in 1956, and he met Mr. Buffett by happenstance three years later. Mr. Munger had flown back to Omaha to organize the affairs of his recently deceased father when he was invited to lunch at the local Omaha Club. There he was introduced to Mr. Buffett by a mutual friend.
Later that week, Mr. Munger attended a dinner party to which Mr. Buffett had also been invited. They hit it off and spent the evening talking. Mr. Buffett later recalled, "He was rolling on the floor laughing at his own jokes, and I thought, 'That is my kind of guy.' I do the same thing."
Days later, they and their wives went to lunch at Johnny's Cafe.
As quoted in "The Snowball," Alice Schroeder's 2008 biography of Mr. Buffett, Nancy Munger at one point asked her husband, "Why are you paying so much attention to him?" Mr. Munger replied: "You don't understand. That is no ordinary human being."
'A Passion to Get Rich'
The men soon found themselves on the phone nearly every day talking about investing strategies. "Warren obviously had a better business model than I did," Mr. Munger said, referring to his billing by the hour for his legal services. "He kept pointing out to me that I had an insane way of making a living, and that his was better and that I should do what he was doing."
Mr. Munger was won over. "Like Warren, I had a considerable passion to get rich," Mr. Munger was quoted as saying in Roger Lowenstein's book "Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist" (1995). "Not because I wanted Ferraris -- I wanted the independence. I desperately wanted it. I thought it was undignified to have to send invoices to other people."
Mr. Munger began investing side by side with Mr. Buffett, in companies like Wesco Financial and See's Candies, before officially joining him as vice chairman. For the first year, he said, "I kept one toe in the law firm in case my capitalist career cratered."
Together they built Berkshire into a $ 500 billion-plus juggernaut whose original shares posted annual gains averaging 21.6 percent between 1965 and 2014, more than twice the 9.9 percent rise for the Standard & Poor's 500. (The company got its name when, early on, Mr. Buffett took over a fading Massachusetts textile manufacturer called Berkshire Hathaway.)
The money Mr. Munger made far surpassed his greatest expectations, he said, but it could have been even more. He said his biggest mistakes were not bad investments, but investments Berkshire failed to make.
He and Mr. Buffett "were offered a stake in McDonald's way early" and decided against it, he said.
"We should have bought a big block of Wal-Mart young," he added. "That was billions that we should've made. We avoided the pharmaceutical industry entirely, and it was the easiest industry to make a lot of money out of all the ones around, and we never made a nickel out of it."
Mr. Munger used his many nickels for an unusual philanthropic passion: architecture. He gave away hundreds of millions of dollars to university architecture projects, including $ 65 million for the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
At least one of his projects caused controversy: His design for a windowless dorm room building at the Santa Barbara campus, for which he contributed $ 200 million, was criticized by some architects and students. He defended it as efficient and effective.
Active Into His 90s
Mr. Buffett remained a vocal proponent of philanthropy through his Giving Pledge, an organization he founded with Bill and Melinda Gates to persuade billionaires to give away at least half their fortunes. But Mr. Munger was conspicuously not on the list. He said it was not that he did not want to sign the pledge. He said his wife, Nancy, who died in 2010 at 86, had wanted her half of the estate passed to the children, "and so I more than did that." He added: "I felt it would be hypocritical for me to be a big pledger. I've already violated the total spirit of it."
Mr. Munger is survived by two daughters from his first marriage, Wendy and Molly Munger; a daughter from his second marriage, Emilie Munger Ogden; three sons from that marriage, Charles Jr., Barry and Philip; two stepsons, William and David Borthwick; 15 grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.
A treasured retreat of his was a northern Minnesota wilderness compound on Star Island in Cass Lake, where his grandparents began summering in 1932 and which became the extended-family seat. In addition to Los Angeles, he had a home in Hawaii.
Under Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger, Berkshire invested heavily in newspapers, among them The Washington Post, The Buffalo News and The Omaha World-Herald. Mr. Munger himself was the chairman of the Daily Journal Corporation, a newspaper publisher, from 1977 to 2022.
He remained active in Berkshire Hathaway into his 90s while serving for decades as chairman of Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, to which he lavishly donated. A Republican, he was also outspoken in support of Planned Parenthood.
Perhaps in another life Mr. Munger, with all his drive and self-assurance, would have been the chief of a giant corporation. But he had no regrets about making his fortune in the shadow of Mr. Buffett.
"I didn't mind at all playing second fiddle to Warren," he said in an interview for this obituary. "Ordinarily, everywhere I go I am very dominant, but when somebody else is better, I'm willing to play the second fiddle. It's just that I was seldom in that position, except with Warren. But I didn't mind it at all."

X May Lose Up to $75 Million as Advertisers Flee: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Internal documents show companies like Airbnb, Coca-Cola and Microsoft have halted ads, or may do so, after Elon Musk's endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory.
X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter, could lose as much as $ 75 million in advertising revenue by the end of the year as dozens of major brands pause their marketing campaigns after its owner, Elon Musk, endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory this month.
Internal documents viewed by The New York Times this week show that the company is in a more difficult position than previously known and that concerns about Mr. Musk and the platform have spread far beyond companies including IBM, Apple and Disney, which paused their advertising campaigns on X last week. The documents list more than 200 ad units of companies from the likes of Airbnb, Amazon, Coca-Cola and Microsoft, many of which have halted or are considering pausing their ads on the social network.
The documents come from X's sales team and are meant to track the impact of all the advertising lapses this month, including those by companies that have already paused and others that may be at risk of doing so. They list how much ad revenue X employees fear the company could lose through the end of the year if advertisers do not return.
On Friday, X said in a statement that $ 11 million in revenue was at risk and that the exact figure fluctuated as some advertisers returned to the platform and others increased spending. The company said the numbers viewed by The Times were either outdated or represented an internal exercise to evaluate total risk.
The advertising freezes come during the final three months of the year, which is traditionally the social media company's strongest quarter as brands run holiday promotions for events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In the last three months of 2021 -- the last year the company reported fourth-quarter earnings before Mr. Musk took over -- the company recorded $ 1.57 billion in revenue, of which nearly 90 percent came from advertising.
Since Mr. Musk's $ 44 billion acquisition of Twitter last year, some brands have been hesitant to advertise on the platform, concerned with Mr. Musk's behavior and content moderation decisions, which have led to a rise in incendiary and hateful content. U.S. advertising on the platform is down nearly 60 percent this year, prompting the company to try to woo back advertisers in an effort its chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, is spearheading. X is also campaigning for advertisers to return during the holiday period to make up for revenue shortfalls earlier in the year.
The documents, however, reveal that has not been going to plan. More than 100 brands are shown as having "fully paused" their ads while dozens of others are listed as "at risk." Many paused on or after Nov. 15, when Mr. Musk wrote in a post on X that the conspiracy theory that Jews supported the immigration of minorities to replace white populations was "the actual truth."
Leesha Anderson, the vice president of digital marketing and social media at the advertising agency Outcast, said its clients steadily stopped spending on X after Mr. Musk took over and had found alternatives on platforms like LinkedIn and TikTok.
"In today's dynamic marketplace, brands have a plethora of platform choices at their disposal for precise audience targeting," she said. "Therefore, it is imperative for the stewards and proprietors of social platforms to exercise deliberate discretion in all aspects, be it their personal beliefs or political stances, as these choices will inevitably undergo public scrutiny."
The organizations that have paused their ads on X range from political campaigns to fast food chains to tech giants, according to the documents. Airbnb, for example, halted more than $ 1 million of advertising, while Uber cut back on ads worth more than $ 800,000, halting campaigns in U.S. and international markets. Both tech companies declined to comment.
Other large brands, including Jack in the Box, Coca-Cola and Netflix, paused some of their campaigns. Netflix's halted ads were worth nearly $ 3 million, according to X's estimates. Jack in the Box, Coca-Cola and Netflix did not respond to requests for comment.
Various subsidiaries of Microsoft have also stopped advertising -- leading to a potential loss of more than $ 4 million in revenue for X's fourth quarter, based on the documents -- as have Amazon's units for books and music and one subsidiary of Google. The search giant and some other brands that have paused spending, including NBC Universal, have continued to post content on the platform without paying X to ensure it reaches a broad audience.
Google and Microsoft declined to comment. Amazon did not return requests for comment.
On the NBC program "Meet the Press" last Sunday, the Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie called Mr. Musk's comment part of a recent outpouring of an "outrageous type of hate."
"Whether it's Elon Musk, whether it's professors on our college campuses or students that they are misleading, or whether it's individuals who are speaking out in an antisemitic way on the streets of our cities," he said.
Two days before Mr. Christie's appearance, a super PAC supporting him, called Tell It Like It Is, pulled its advertising from X, according to the documents. A representative for the political fund-raising group did not respond to a request for comment.
In an internal meeting with employees at X this week, Ms. Yaccarino cut a defiant mood. She made no mention of Mr. Musk's endorsement of the antisemitic post and attributed the company's problems to a report by the left-wing media watchdog group Media Matters, which showed that ads on X from companies like IBM and Apple appeared next to posts promoting white nationalist and Nazi content.
On Monday, after Mr. Musk called Media Matters "an evil organization," X sued the group and argued that its report, which was published after Mr. Musk's statement, "manipulated the algorithms governing the user experience on X to bypass safeguards and create images of X's largest advertisers' paid posts adjacent to racist, incendiary content." Ms. Yaccarino has blamed the Media Matters report for X's declining ad sales.
"Kowtowing to external criticism or pressures is simply not how X will ever operate," she wrote in an email to X employees on Wednesday that was seen by The Times. "The people at X are free speech defenders. We stand in solidarity with those who believe in this fundamental right and the critical checks and balances of a thriving democracy."
Earlier this week, Mr. Musk spent time celebrating companies that have continued to advertise on X, including the National Football League. Using a heart emoji, X's billionaire owner said he loved the N.F.L. (The New York Times largely stopped marketing on the platform in early 2023, though the company's sports publication, The Athletic, has continued to purchase ads, according to a spokesman.)
Mr. Musk also noted that the company would donate "all revenue from advertising & subscriptions associated with the war in Gaza to hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza." The funding will include revenue from ads bought by charity groups, news organizations and other groups that advertised content related to the conflict.
Following her boss, Ms. Yaccarino added to Mr. Musk's original post with a plea.
"Lean in and help," she wrote on X.

Full text: Where Some Empty Offices Are Becoming Homes
Readers responded at nytimes.com to Matthew Haag's article last Sunday about a change for some buildings in the financial district. Comments have been edited. Where is the affordable housing in this plan? Creating luxury apartments that are used as tax shelters for foreign nationals (who never live in them) is not a viable solution to the housing crisis. It only serves the developers. In Canada, a tax is about to be imposed on owners who do not occupy their residences (to help with the housing crisis in Toronto).
Ellen Silver, New York
Housing, housing, housing! Anything we can do to build more of it should be encouraged. And while it would be great for these conversions to include affordable housing, that simply may not be possible. But let's not let the perfect be the enemy of the good here. More housing of any kind will eventually help keep all prices lower. Build. More. Housing. Period.
Seb, New York
This is a win-win, for developers and for desperately struggling New York renters, but we need more. I want to see huge subsidies for converting commercial real estate to affordable housing, or even better: fines for unoccupied or underutilized space. There should not be so much empty real estate when rents are what they are in New York. When people are homeless and families are sharing one small room, it's a crime to waste space.
nate, NH
Every development should have a portion, say 20-25 percent, allotted to rent stabilization or low income for buildings with more than 20 units. That way people in need are spread across the city and not into some kind of project.
Deirdre, New Jersey
I wholly support the conversion of abandoned or unused office space into residential housing in our cities and in our suburbs; lots of solid buildings out there are ripe to be transformed to meet critical need for housing. It is up to cities and states to make sure a good percentage of them are priced affordably. But this is really good for cities especially. It will revive dead zones and tackle the blight of all those empty storefronts too.
LucyDog, Boston
How about we pay a lot of people more money for their hard work and a lot of rich people get less from just sitting on their money and playing with it so that much more people can afford homes and participate better in society. Capitalism is good, but the Shark Tank capitalism executed in the United States is obviously not the solution, because way too many can't afford decent houses or apartments while a few people are richer than some countries.
Lydia, New England
Good, good, good. More, more, more. I am someone who lived on a boat in New York (79th Street Boat Basin) in the winter, so places that aren't necessarily apartments can be homes and great experiences.
Peter James, Queens
How is creating housing where there was none before a bad thing for anyone? Anyway, all the evidence shows that creating any housing, whether "affordable" or not, lowers rents across the board. And one doesn't even need to take Econ 101 to understand why greater supply, in the absence of collusion, leads to lower prices.
Addicted, USA
People complain about high-end housing, but all housing is needed. If you have 10 people and only nine houses, the poorest person is always left homeless.
Bill, Harlem
When I graduated from the University of Texas, Austin, in 1979, I got a job as a flight attendant for Eastern Airlines. After Miami training, they sent our class to New York. Five of us decided to find an apartment together. As you can imagine we weren't making much money. We looked in Queens at an apartment that looked like Archie Bunker's place. Then we found a one-bedroom, with a loft and two bathrooms in the very recently converted original Edison Building in the financial district. There was a pizza restaurant where you could get a giant slice and Coke for $ 5 (maybe less); it was a deal. I will never forget coming "home" from a visit back to my parents in Texas. I was coming out of the subway with my suitcase and a man's hand reached down to grab my bag. I thought, "Oh, no," until I looked up to see it was the nice man from the pizza shop reaching down to help me out. I loved, and still love, New York!

Rosalynn Carter, First Lady and Partner to a President, Dies at 96: [Biography]

Full text: She helped propel Jimmy Carter from rural Georgia to the White House and became the most politically active first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt
Rosalynn Carter, a true life partner to Jimmy Carter who helped propel him from rural Georgia to the White House in a single decade and became the most politically active first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt, died on Sunday in Plains, Ga. She was 96.
The Carter Center in Atlanta announced her death. It had disclosed on May 30 that Mrs. Carter had dementia. "She continues to live happily at home with her husband, enjoying spring in Plains and visits with loved ones," a statement by the center said at the time. On Friday, the center said she had entered hospice care at home.
Mr. Carter, 99, the longest-living president in American history, has also been in hospice care at their home, but so far he has defied expectations. The Carter Center had announced in February that he was stopping full-scale medical care "after a series of short hospital stays," and his family was preparing for the end. But he has hung on -- and celebrated his most recent birthday on Oct. 1.
Mrs. Carter was the second longest-lived first lady; Bess Truman, the widow of President Harry S. Truman, was 97 when she died in 1982.
Over their nearly eight decades together, Mr. and Mrs. Carter forged the closest of bonds, developing a personal and professional symbiosis remarkable for its sheer longevity.
Their extraordinary union began formally with their marriage in 1946, but, in a manner of speaking, it began long before that, with a touch of kismet, just after Rosalynn (pronounced ROSE-a-lynn) was born in Plains in 1927.
She had been delivered by Mr. Carter's mother, a nurse. And a few days later, in a scene that might have been concocted by Hollywood, his mother took little Jimmy to Rosalynn's house, where he "peeked into the cradle to see the newest baby on the street," as he recalled in his 2015 memoir, "A Full Life, Reflections at Ninety."
He was not quite 3. Eighteen years would pass before the two would truly connect. But once they did, they became life and work partners, melding so completely that as president Mr. Carter would call her "an almost equal extension of myself."
Reared in the same tiny patch of Georgia farmland, 150 miles south of Atlanta, they were similar in temperament and outlook. They shared a fierce work ethic, a drive for self-improvement and an earnest, even pious, demeanor. Their Christian faith was central to their lives. Both were frugal. Both could be stubborn.
After Mr. Carter lost his re-election bid in 1980 to Ronald Reagan, he and Mrs. Carter embarked on what became the longest, most active post-presidency in American history. They traveled the world in support of human rights, democracy and health programs; domestically, they labored in service to others, most prominently pounding nails to help build houses for Habitat for Humanity.
In October 2019, after more than 73 years of marriage, they became the nation's longest-married presidential couple, surpassing the record set by George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush. The Carters marked their 77th wedding anniversary in July.
In the continuum of first ladies after Mrs. Roosevelt, Mrs. Carter broke the mold. Like most of the others, she championed a cause -- hers was the treatment of mental illness. But she also immersed herself in the business of the nation and kept a sharp eye on politics, a realm her husband famously claimed to ignore.
She frequently attended Mr. Carter's cabinet meetings and traveled abroad to meet with heads of state in visits labeled substantive, not ceremonial. She often sat in on the daily National Security Council briefings held for the president and senior staff.
The couple held a weekly working lunch to discuss policy. Mrs. Carter testified before Congress and lobbied its members. Her handwriting appears on the drafts of many of her husband's speeches and policy addresses.
Though soft-spoken, she was nevertheless assertive about her power and influence in public affairs.
"I was more a political partner than a political wife," she wrote in her memoir, "First Lady From Plains," published in 1984. She was referring to her years as first lady of Georgia, but her description applied equally to her tenure in the White House, from 1977 to 1981.
"When I come home very discouraged," Mr. Carter told The New York Times in 1979, "she listens to only just a few words and she looks around at me and says that I've got a problem with this or that. She knows enough about the background of that problem that I don't have to sit for two hours and explain it to her."
A full 16 years before Bill and Hillary Clinton would offer themselves to the nation as a package deal with the slogan "Buy one, get one free," the Carters functioned as near co-presidents. The New York Times columnist Tom Wicker wrote in 1979 that Mrs. Carter "may be the most powerful first lady since Edith Bolling Wilson virtually took over for a stricken president," Woodrow Wilson.
Mrs. Carter entered the White House at the height of the women's movement and seemed to derive strength from it, though she did not identify herself as a feminist. She lobbied vigorously for the Equal Rights Amendment and for women to participate at all levels of government, from honor guard at the White House to justice of the Supreme Court. She had her staff assemble a roster of qualified women for various appointments, according to the National First Ladies' Library, and she suggested candidates for federal judgeships.
With her push, Congress formally recognized the office of the first lady as a federal position and provided funding for a staff. Mrs. Carter became the first presidential wife to carry a briefcase daily to a White House office.
While Mr. Carter held himself above politics, saying it was not in his DNA -- to the detriment of his presidency, his critics said -- his wife acknowledged that for her, politics came naturally.
"I've always said I'm more political than Jimmy," she once said. "I'm political, he's not."
Her husband's advisers concurred. "She is clearly the most political first lady, maybe in history, in terms of being involved in politics and in the campaign," Patrick Caddell, Mr. Carter's pollster, told The Times during the 1980 re-election effort.
Robert S. Strauss, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called her, admiringly, "a political animal."
The news media often asked Mrs. Carter whether she should be wielding so much influence given that she had not been elected.
As she told The Times in 1978: "I don't think the people in this country are worried about where I'm going." She added: "And I'm not doing what I'm doing for people who write about it. I'm doing it for the people I can help. And I really believe that I can help."
She pointed out that she had worked outside the home all her life. "I can't stay at home and do Cokes and teas," she said, "although I think that for those people who want to do that, then that's surely important to them."
The remark was strikingly similar to a sentiment that Mrs. Clinton would express in 1992: "I suppose I could have stayed home, baked cookies and had teas," Mrs. Clinton said. While Mrs. Clinton's remark provoked a backlash, Mrs. Carter never drew that kind of wrath; she was not as contentious a figure as Mrs. Clinton and was never perceived as harboring political ambitions of her own.
But her impulse to use her influence could create headaches for the Carter administration. And in one particular case it led to political disaster. Shortly after scores of Americans were taken hostage in Iran in 1979, creating the biggest crisis of the Carter presidency, Mrs. Carter, without telling her husband, asked his brother, Billy, to use his ties to the Libyan government to seek the hostages' release.
Nothing bad resulted from her request, but the subsequent disclosure that she had acted unilaterally on such a sensitive subject shocked the nation. Billy Carter, who eventually registered as a foreign agent to Libya, was often perceived as trading on his brother's position for personal profit, and at the time of Mrs. Carter's request, his ties to Libya were under investigation by the Justice Department.
For all of her involvement in presidential affairs, Mrs. Carter asserted that once her husband had made up his mind, she was powerless to change it. "He might be influenced to a certain degree," she said, "but people just don't know Jimmy Carter if they think I can persuade him to do something he doesn't want to do."
This was evident in early 1977, when he decided to lower the thermostats in the White House to 65 degrees during the day and to 55 at night. He wanted to set an example to encourage Americans to conserve energy and reduce reliance on foreign oil. Mrs. Carter said she got so cold that she could not concentrate and that her aides had to type with their gloves on. When he spurned her plea to crank up the thermostat, she resigned herself to wearing long underwear.
A Crush From Afar
Eleanor Rosalynn Smith was born on Aug. 18, 1927, the eldest of four children of Wilburn Edgar and Frances Allethea (Murray) Smith, who was known as Allie. Her father was a car mechanic, her mother a dressmaker.
After Rosalynn was brought into the world by Lillian Carter, Jimmy Carter's mother, who also helped deliver her siblings, Rosalynn became playmates with Jimmy's younger sister, Ruth (later Ruth Carter Stapleton, the evangelist).
As a teenager, while Jimmy was a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., Rosalynn developed a crush on him -- she had seen a picture of him in his Navy uniform on Ruth's wall. Rosalynn and Ruth conspired for years to get him to notice her, but after his fateful glimpse of her as a newborn, they had few encounters.
The Smiths were not as well off as the Carters. Rosalynn was 13 when her father died of leukemia, and her mother was left with an insurance policy that paid $ 18.75 a month. Rosalynn helped with the sewing and housekeeping and with raising her siblings. She also worked at the local beauty parlor, shampooing hair.
Despite her hardships and obligations, she was valedictorian of her class at Plains High School. She later commuted to Georgia Southwestern College, then a junior college (now Georgia Southwestern State University), in nearby Americus.
In 1945, when Mr. Carter was home on leave, he finally noticed Rosalynn and asked her out. She said yes.
"She's the girl I want to marry," he told his mother after that first date.
He later wrote, "She was remarkably beautiful, almost painfully shy, obviously intelligent, and yet unrestrained in our discussion on the rumble seat of the Ford Coupe."
To Rosalynn, this upwardly mobile midshipman represented an escape from the small-town life that seemed to be her fate.
When she visited him at Annapolis that winter, he proposed, but she turned him down; she had promised her father on his deathbed that she wouldn't marry until she finished college.
By summer, they had both graduated, she from junior college and he from Annapolis. They married on July 7, 1946. She was 18, he was 21.
The couple moved to Norfolk, Va., where Mr. Carter was stationed, though they would soon hopscotch across the country. The birthplaces of their three sons reflected their varied postings: John William was born in Virginia in 1947; James Earl III in Hawaii in 1950; and Donnel Jeffrey in Connecticut in 1952. (Their daughter, Amy, was born in Plains in 1967, long after Mr. Carter had left the Navy.)
In addition to her husband, Mrs. Carter is survived by her four children; 11 grandchildren; 14 great-grandchildren, and her sister, Lillian Allethea Smith Wall. Her brothers, Murray and Jerrold, both died in 2003.
While in the Navy, Mr. Carter was away at sea much of the time. Although Mrs. Carter struggled at home alone with their young boys, she liked seeing the country and became increasingly confident and independent.
But when Mr. Carter's father died in 1953 and her husband told her that they were moving back to Plains to take over the family peanut business, Mrs. Carter became distraught. She cried and screamed, she recalled in her memoir. She couldn't bear the thought of returning to the small town they had left, or of living so close to her strong-willed mother and her strong-willed mother-in-law.
"It was the most serious argument of our marriage," she wrote.
And one she lost.
Back in Plains, she was miserable and mostly stayed at home. Neighbors complained that she was aloof. The farm sputtered in a drought.
Eventually, Mrs. Carter eased into the financial side of the business, keeping the books and paying the bills. As she started advising her husband, their professional partnership began to develop, and she helped build the company into a lucrative farm supply business. It was a turning point in their relationship.
Politics Beckons
The civil rights movement brought upheaval to the South in the early 1960s. The Carters, unlike many of their neighbors, supported school desegregation, and Mr. Carter was inspired to run for office. He won a seat in the Georgia State Senate and in 1966 lost his first try for the governorship. Throughout those tumultuous years, Mrs. Carter continued to manage the business. Importantly, she overcame her terror of public speaking and immersed herself in her husband's campaigns, helping him win the governor's race in 1970.
"At the beginning, she was imprisoned by her shyness," E. Stanly Godbold Jr., a Carter biographer, said in an interview for this obituary. "Once she started breaking out of her shell, she piggybacked her career onto her husband's. Then she had a foot in both worlds, the liberated career woman as well as the supportive spouse."
After Mr. Carter defeated Gerald R. Ford for president in 1976, Mrs. Carter brought a modesty to the White House, in stark contrast to the imperial presidency of the disgraced Richard M. Nixon, whose resignation had put Ford, his vice president, into the Oval Office.
On Inauguration Day, the Carter family walked down Pennsylvania Avenue to No. 1600. Only Thomas Jefferson had made that trek on foot before them, in 1801; the Carters' decision began a tradition that the nation now expects of its newly minted first families.
At the inaugural balls, Mrs. Carter wore the same blue chiffon gown she had worn to the governor's ball in Atlanta six years earlier.
The Carters sent their daughter to public school. They also brought her nanny, Mary Prince, to Washington. Ms. Prince had been wrongly convicted of murder in Georgia and, under a work-release program, assigned to work in the governor's mansion. With Mrs. Carter's help, she received a reprieve so that she could move into the White House, a move enabled by Mr. Carter's having himself designated to be Ms. Prince's parole officer. After a later re-examination of the evidence in her case, she received a full pardon.
The new first lady plunged into public affairs. At cabinet meetings, she did not speak but frequently buttonholed cabinet secretaries later to ask questions and then followed up with her husband.
More than 15 years before Mrs. Clinton caused a stir by leading President Clinton's effort to overhaul the nation's health care system, Mrs. Carter sought to upgrade the mental health system and expand services and protections for older Americans. Barred by statute from serving in an official capacity, Mrs. Carter was named honorary chairwoman of her husband's mental health commission and led the White House Conference on Aging. She conducted nationwide hearings on both topics, testified before Congress and pressed for legislation.
The chief legislation she championed -- the Mental Health Systems Act, which set up support and financing for community mental health centers -- passed in 1980, though it was later scrapped by the Reagan administration. Another measure she had long sought -- for health insurance to cover mental illness just as it covered physical illness -- eventually passed but not until 2008, when President George W. Bush signed it into law.
Mrs. Carter's activism also had global reach. She served as her husband's envoy to Latin America. And when she learned details of the genocide in Cambodia and the refugee crisis there, she flew to see conditions for herself. She raised millions of dollars for relief and, according to the National First Ladies' Library, she convinced Mr. Carter to increase U.S. quotas for refugees, permit food delivery directly into Cambodia and accelerate Peace Corps efforts in the region.
'I Don't Like to Lose'
As his re-election approached in 1980, with his poll numbers sagging, Mr. Carter, preoccupied by the hostage crisis in Iran, found himself largely confined to the White House and unable to campaign. Mrs. Carter stepped in as campaigner-in-chief, making speeches on the hustings and battling his challenger Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts for delegates at the Democratic convention.
Although Mr. Carter won his party's nomination, it all came to naught in November, when Reagan decimated him at the ballot box, sweeping 44 states to Mr. Carter's six. Mrs. Carter did not hide her disappointment, saying she was "bitter enough for both of us."
Their eviction from the White House at relatively young ages -- he was 56, she was 53 -- left them angry, morose and righteous. "I'd like people to know that we were right, that what Jimmy Carter was doing was best for our country, and that people made a mistake by not voting for him," Mrs. Carter wrote at the end of her memoir, adding: "I don't like to lose."
Eventually they regrouped and delved into multiple projects at home and abroad.
They co-founded the Carter Center in Atlanta to promote peace, resolve conflicts and eradicate diseases. One week a year, they helped build houses for Habitat for Humanity, working on more than 4,000 homes in more than a dozen countries. And they wrote a book together, "Everything to Gain: Making the Most of the Rest of Your Life," published in 1987.
In 1999, the Carters jointly received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor and one rarely bestowed on a husband and wife.
Mrs. Carter, who also co-founded a nonprofit that promotes childhood immunizations, served as a deacon at the Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains and liked to go fly-fishing and bird-watching with her husband. She practiced tai chi and meditated.
But her primary cause remained trying to reduce the stigma of mental illness, an effort reiterated in the Carter Center statement in May disclosing that she had dementia.
"One in 10 older Americans have dementia," the statement said. "We hope sharing our family's news will increase important conversations at kitchen tables and in doctor's offices around the country."
In championing mental health, Mrs. Carter served on several boards, hosted conferences and wrote books on the subject, including "Within Our Reach: Ending the Mental Health Crisis" (2010).
Recognizing the importance of caregiving, she founded and served as president of the board for the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving at Georgia Southwestern, her alma mater. Mrs. Carter often noted that there are only four kinds of people in the world: those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers, and those who will need caregivers.
The Carter Center announced on Feb. 18 this year that Mr. Carter would live out his final days at their home in Plains. Mrs. Carter stayed with him there, at the small one-story ranch house where, except for their four-year detour to the White House, the couple had lived since 1961.
Mrs. Carter's dementia had blurred some of her memories, her grandson Josh Carter told The Times in August, but she never forgot who her husband was.
They still held hands, Josh Carter said, adding: "They still sit on the couch together, in the same place they've always sat."

The Cybersecurity Suit That's Riveting Boards: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: An S.E.C. lawsuit against a software company hacked by Russian state actors in 2020 could affect how companies handle cybersecurity risks.
For the last month, an under-the-radar lawsuit has privately been a hot topic of conversation in Fortune 500 boardrooms and corporate security departments.
In October, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued a software company hacked by Russian agents in 2020, accusing it of defrauding investors by not disclosing allegedly known cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities.
The lawsuit named not just the company, SolarWinds, but also its chief information security officer, Timothy Brown. A year earlier, a former chief security officer at Uber, Joe Sullivan, was found guilty of failing to disclose a data breach to federal regulators. Executives heading up cybersecurity have a sense that their personal risk is increasing.
"I've been doing this for 25 years, and I've always been protecting others," said George Gerchow, the chief security officer and senior vice president of information technology at Sumo Logic, a software company. "Now, all of a sudden, I'm in a weird position where I'm having to protect myself."
Perhaps more alarming to boardrooms is that SolarWinds did disclose some cybersecurity risks -- in the same way that just about all public companies do.
"You can track it across a hundred different companies, that they're all basically using the exact same language," said Josephine Wolff, an associate professor of cybersecurity policy at Tufts University.
Now it seems the S.E.C. no longer considers those boilerplate disclosures to be sufficient if the company knows of more specific risks. The lawsuit is the first in which the S.E.C. has charged a company with intentional fraud related to cybersecurity disclosures, according to the law firm White & Case.
In his first interview since the S.E.C. complaint, the C.E.O. of SolarWinds, Sudhakar Ramakrishna, told DealBook that the company hadn't known about the issue that exposed it to the cyberattack in 2020, and that the lawsuit was "an attempt, we believe, by the S.E.C. to advance policy."
The lawsuit could "actually make CISOs more fearful, not more emboldened to raise their voice," he said.
Most experts agree that, regardless of the lawsuit's outcome, it could affect how companies handle cybersecurity risks. But they're divided over whether it will encourage better or worse practices.
The lawsuit is not the only sign the S.E.C. is paying attention to cybersecurity. In July, the agency adopted new cybersecurity disclosure requirements set to take effect in December. They require companies to report material attacks within four days and to make yearly disclosures about their cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. In a June speech, the S.E.C.'s enforcement director, Gurbir Grewal, said it had "zero tolerance for gamesmanship" around cybersecurity disclosures.
Some experts worry that the lawsuit could have a chilling effect. "There were some serious warning signs that he and his team had surfaced," Wolff said of the SolarWinds CISO. "And now that's being used against him specifically to say, 'You knew about this, you didn't disclose it in the S.E.C. filings.' Which I think really does create an incentive to never document or never find any vulnerabilities anywhere." That could make it difficult for the I.T. department to ask for money for cybersecurity, she said.
Ramakrishna, the SolarWinds C.E.O., said that being expected to disclose every potential security vulnerability could make it easier for attackers to abuse them. "For one, it'll be too many for the average investor to understand," he said. "For another, I think we'll be playing into the hands of the threat."
Others argue that the threat of S.E.C. action could empower executives in charge of cybersecurity. Jake Williams, a security expert who consults with companies when they've experienced a data breach, said he regularly saw CISOs being asked to "paint a rosy or maybe rosier-than-aligned-with-reality picture." But he added: "That practice, I think, died the day the SolarWinds lawsuit was filed by the agency. No CISO can now risk basically painting an unrealistically positive picture of cybersecurity."
Harley Geiger is a lawyer who specializes in cybersecurity at the law firm Venable and is part of the team representing a coalition of tech companies including Cisco, Broadcom, Microsoft and Google. He said there were ways for CISOs to react to increased personal risk other than avoiding documentation of concerns and recommendations, including by erring on the side of escalating risks and vulnerabilities.
"They may want to be covered by a company's insurance policy. They may want indemnification in their employment contracts," Geiger said. "I think it would be the wrong message for or the wrong takeaway for CISOs to choose to ignore or not escalate material cybersecurity information."
If generic disclosures aren't enough, what is? Being too specific about vulnerabilities could give attackers valuable information, while being too broad isn't valuable to investors. "The question," Wolff said, "is can the S.E.C. define a clear middle ground." -- Sarah Kessler
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
An inflation surprise ignites a market rally. The Consumer Price Index report released on Tuesday showed that inflation cooled last month more than analysts had expected, helped by a fall in energy prices. Investors cheered the news as a bevy of Wall Street economists concluded that the Federal Reserve was most likely done with raising interest rates.
Another Republican drops out of the presidential race. Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator, suspended his campaign this week. He and the rest of the Republican field have trailed Donald Trump by double-digit margins for months. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor, had a better week. She appeared to be close to winning over big conservative donors, including Ken Griffin of Citadel.
Trump's social media platform is struggling. Trump Media & Technology Group, the firm that runs Truth Social, has racked up big losses and may not survive without new funding, a regulatory filing this week disclosed. Truth Social has been pinning its future on a long-delayed merger with a shell company meant to take it public, giving it access to roughly $ 300 million in funding.
An A.I. pioneer on her life and science
When Fei-Fei Li, co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, showed the first draft of her book project to one of her colleagues, he told her to throw it away.
"He said that there's a lot of scientists who can write about the ideas of technology," Li told DealBook. But the colleague added that "my unique personal journey, as an immigrant, as a woman, as someone whose coming-of-age as a scientist is so intertwined with the coming-of-age of modern A.I., would give even those who are not traditionally in the world of tech a voice to identify with."
Li persevered, and the book, "The Worlds I See: Curiosity, Exploration, and Discovery at the Dawn of AI," was published this month, telling the story of the growth of A.I. and her own story as an immigrant from China who became one of the world's leading experts in the field.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
What should a business leader take away from your book?
There's so much debate and confusion and, frankly, anxiety around A.I. Part of the anxiety comes from not knowing what it is. Part of it comes from not knowing what it's going to do. I hope this book sort of dispels both.
Tools are made by humans, designed by humans, used by humans. We have responsibilities as well as agency.
You write about the complex consequences of commercial investment in A.I. Can you tell me more about that?
At the beginning of my career, it was just pure scientific inquiry, curiosity. Nobody was paying attention. As A.I. became more powerful, as more resources from the industry poured into it, as its social impact was surfacing -- it is a natural course of a profound technological change that it brings complexity.
Our ecosystem of innovation in America is hopefully driven by a combination of private sector, public sector and government. Right now, we have an imbalance. I'm hoping the public sector can still be a trusted source of evaluating and assessing and understanding and explaining this technology, but also be at the forefront of scientific discovery for the public good.
What risks are you most focused on?
I personally focus on societal risks, from disinformation to bias and privacy, infringement to job disruption, to weaponization.
I do think there is responsibility, especially for the media, as well as the government, to engage in this discourse responsibly. I'm concerned when the media is biasing their megaphones to very few voices that are much more hyperbolic, focusing on existential crises, rather than the real social risks that will deeply impact everyday people, especially people from underserved communities.
Is the government doing enough?
President Biden's executive order was a good first step because it's broad and relatively balanced. But that truly is a first step. What is really important is to have the humility, especially for policymakers and business leaders, to recognize that this is new. So learn about what this is before making policy.
DealBook readers respond: Sam Bankman-Fried
As crypto crime watchers know, Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty on Nov. 2 for his role in the collapse of FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange. The big question remaining: How long of a prison term will the 31-year-old get?
The maximum term is more than 100 years. Last Saturday, we asked DealBook readers what would be a fair sentence. Many respondents shared their view that the judge should not go easy on Bankman-Fried at the sentencing hearing, scheduled for March.
Here's a selection of what readers had to say about Bankman-Fried, the American justice system and the wider cryptocurrency market:
"Perhaps because I am a former prosecutor, I believe white-collar criminals should be sentenced on a par with violent ones, or perhaps more severely because the societal impacts are generally broader and the mitigating factors (socioeconomic status, etc.) are less compelling." -- Ted Baker
"What about the crypto investors who got fleeced; how does locking him up help them? Retributive justice and rehabilitation don't speak in any way to making the investors as whole as possible." -- Thomas Haible
"I think a factor is that crypto is primarily a fixation of gamblers. Call them traders. Call them investors. But they're not. They're bettors." -- Barry Morse
Thanks for reading! We'll see you Monday.

Rosalynn Carter, First Lady and a Political Partner, Dies at 96

Rosalynn Carter, a true life partner to Jimmy Carter who helped propel him from rural Georgia to the White House in a single decade and became the most politically active first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt, died Sunday in Plains, Georgia. She was 96.
The Carter Center in Atlanta announced her death. It had disclosed May 30 that Carter had dementia. “She continues to live happily at home with her husband, enjoying spring in Plains and visits with loved ones,” a statement by the center said at the time. On Friday, the center said she had entered hospice care at home.
Jimmy Carter, 99, the longest-living president in American history, has also been in hospice care at their home, but so far he has defied expectations. The Carter Center had announced in February that he was stopping full-scale medical care “after a series of short hospital stays,” and his family was preparing for the end. But he has hung on — and celebrated his most-recent birthday on Oct. 1.
Rosalynn Carter was the second-longest-lived first lady; Bess Truman, widow of President Harry S. Truman, was 97 when she died in 1982.
Over their nearly eight decades together, the Carters forged the closest of bonds, developing a personal and professional symbiosis remarkable for its sheer longevity.
Their extraordinary union began formally with their marriage in 1946, but, in a manner of speaking, it began long before that, with a touch of kismet, just after Rosalynn was born in Plains in 1927.
She had been delivered by Jimmy Carter’s mother, a nurse. And a few days later, in a scene that might have been concocted by Hollywood, his mother took little Jimmy to Rosalynn’s house, where he “peeked into the cradle to see the newest baby on the street,” as he recalled in his 2015 memoir, “A Full Life: Reflections at Ninety.”
He was not quite 3. Eighteen years would pass before the two would truly connect. But once they did, they became life and work partners, melding so completely that, as president, Carter would call her “an almost equal extension of myself.”
Reared in the same tiny patch of Georgia farmland, 150 miles south of Atlanta, they were similar in temperament and outlook. They shared a fierce work ethic, a drive for self-improvement and an earnest, even pious, demeanor. Their Christian faith was central to their lives. Both were frugal. Both could be stubborn.
After Jimmy Carter lost his reelection bid in 1980 to Ronald Reagan, he and Rosalynn Carter embarked on what became the longest, most active post-presidency in American history. They traveled the world in support of human rights, democracy and health programs; domestically, they labored in service to others, most prominently pounding nails to help build houses for Habitat for Humanity.
In October 2019, after more than 73 years of marriage, they became the nation’s longest-married presidential couple, surpassing the record set by George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush. The Carters marked their 77th wedding anniversary in July.
In the continuum of first ladies after Roosevelt, Carter broke the mold. Like most of the others, she championed a cause — hers was the treatment of mental illness. But she also immersed herself in the business of the nation and kept a sharp eye on politics, a realm her husband famously claimed to ignore.
She frequently attended Carter’s Cabinet meetings and traveled abroad to meet with heads of state in visits labeled substantive, not ceremonial. She often sat in on the daily National Security Council briefings held for the president and senior staff.
The couple held a weekly working lunch to discuss policy. Rosalynn Carter testified before Congress and lobbied its members. Her handwriting appears on the drafts of many of her husband’s speeches and policy addresses.
Though soft-spoken, she was nevertheless assertive about her power and influence in public affairs.
“I was more a political partner than a political wife,” she wrote in her memoir, “First Lady From Plains” (1984). She was referring to her years as first lady of Georgia, but her description applied equally to her tenure in the White House, from 1977-81.
“When I come home very discouraged,” Jimmy Carter told The New York Times in 1979, “she listens to only just a few words and she looks around at me and says that I’ve got a problem with this or that. She knows enough about the background of that problem that I don’t have to sit for two hours and explain it to her.”
A full 16 years before Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton would offer themselves to the nation as a package deal with the slogan “Buy one, get one free,” the Carters functioned as near co-presidents. Times columnist Tom Wicker wrote in 1979 that Rosalynn Carter “may be the most powerful first lady since Edith Bolling Wilson virtually took over for a stricken president,” Woodrow Wilson.
Rosalynn Carter entered the White House at the height of the women’s movement and seemed to derive strength from it, although she did not identify herself as a feminist. She lobbied vigorously for the Equal Rights Amendment and for women to participate at all levels of government, from honor guard at the White House to justice of the Supreme Court. She had her staff assemble a roster of qualified women for various appointments, according to the National First Ladies’ Library, and she suggested candidates for federal judgeships.
With her push, Congress formally recognized the office of the first lady as a federal position and provided funding for a staff. She became the first presidential wife to carry a briefcase daily to a White House office.
While Carter held himself above politics, saying it was not in his DNA — to the detriment of his presidency, his critics said — his wife acknowledged that for her, politics came naturally.
“I’ve always said I’m more political than Jimmy,” she once said. “I’m political, he’s not.”
Her husband’s advisers concurred. “She is clearly the most political first lady, maybe in history, in terms of being involved in politics and in the campaign,” Patrick Caddell, Jimmy Carter’s pollster, told the Times during the 1980 reelection effort.
Robert Strauss, former chair of the Democratic National Committee, called her, admiringly, “a political animal.”
The news media often asked her whether she should be wielding so much influence given that she had not been elected.
As she told the Times in 1978: “I don’t think the people in this country are worried about where I’m going.” She added: “And I’m not doing what I’m doing for people who write about it. I’m doing it for the people I can help. And I really believe that I can help.”
She pointed out that she had worked outside the home all her life. “I can’t stay at home and do Cokes and teas,” she said, “although I think that for those people who want to do that, then that’s surely important to them.”
The remark was strikingly similar to a sentiment that Hillary Rodham Clinton would express in 1992: “I suppose I could have stayed home, baked cookies and had teas,” she said. Alhough her remark provoked a backlash, Rosalynn Carter never drew that kind of wrath; she was not as contentious a figure as Hillary Rodham Clinton and was never perceived as harboring political ambitions of her own.
But her impulse to use her influence could create headaches for the Carter administration. And in one particular case, it led to political disaster. Shortly after scores of Americans were taken hostage in Iran in 1979, creating the biggest crisis of the Carter presidency, Rosalynn Carter, without telling her husband, asked his brother, Billy, to use his ties to the Libyan government to seek the hostages’ release.
Nothing bad resulted from her request, but the subsequent disclosure that she had acted unilaterally on such a sensitive subject shocked the nation. Billy Carter, who eventually registered as a foreign agent to Libya, was often perceived as trading on his brother’s position for personal profit, and at the time of Rosalynn Carter’s request, his ties to Libya were under investigation by the Justice Department.
For all of her involvement in presidential affairs, Carter asserted that once her husband had made up his mind, she was powerless to change it. “He might be influenced to a certain degree,” she said, “but people just don’t know Jimmy Carter if they think I can persuade him to do something he doesn’t want to do.”
This was evident in early 1977, when he decided to lower the thermostats in the White House to 65 degrees during the day and to 55 at night. He wanted to set an example to encourage Americans to conserve energy and reduce reliance on foreign oil. She said she got so cold that she could not concentrate and that her aides had to type with their gloves on. When he spurned her plea to crank up the thermostat, she resigned herself to wearing long underwear.
A Crush From Afar
Eleanor Rosalynn Smith was born Aug. 18, 1927, the eldest of four children of Wilburn Edgar and Frances Allethea (Murray) Smith, who was known as Allie. Her father was a car mechanic, her mother a dressmaker.
After Rosalynn was brought into the world by Lillian Carter, Jimmy Carter’s mother, who also helped deliver her siblings, Rosalynn became playmates with Jimmy’s younger sister, Ruth (later Ruth Carter Stapleton, the evangelist).
As a teenager, while Jimmy Carter was a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Rosalynn developed a crush on him — she had seen a picture of him in his Navy uniform on Ruth’s wall. Rosalynn and Ruth conspired for years to get him to notice her, but after his fateful glimpse of her as a newborn, they had few encounters.
The Smiths were not as well off as the Carters. Rosalynn was 13 when her father died of leukemia, and her mother was left with an insurance policy that paid $18.75 a month. Rosalynn helped with the sewing and housekeeping and with raising her siblings. She also worked at the local beauty parlor, shampooing hair.
Despite her hardships and obligations, she was valedictorian of her class at Plains High School. She later commuted to Georgia Southwestern College, then a junior college (now Georgia Southwestern State University), in nearby Americus.
In 1945, when Carter was home on leave, he finally noticed Rosalynn and asked her out. She said yes.
“She’s the girl I want to marry,” he told his mother after that first date.
He later wrote, “She was remarkably beautiful, almost painfully shy, obviously intelligent, and yet unrestrained in our discussion on the rumble seat of the Ford Coupe.”
To Rosalynn, this upwardly mobile midshipman represented an escape from the small-town life that seemed to be her fate.
When she visited him at Annapolis that winter, he proposed, but she turned him down; she had promised her father on his deathbed that she wouldn’t marry until she finished college.
By summer, they had both graduated, she from junior college and he from Annapolis. They married on July 7, 1946. She was 18, he was 21.
The couple moved to Norfolk, Virginia, where Carter was stationed, although they would soon hopscotch across the country. The birthplaces of their three sons reflected their varied postings: John William was born in Virginia in 1947; James Earl III in Hawaii in 1950; and Donnel Jeffrey in Connecticut in 1952. (Their daughter, Amy, was born in Plains in 1967, long after Jimmy Carter had left the Navy.)
In addition to her husband, Rosalynn Carter is survived by her four children; 11 grandchildren; 14 great-grandchildren; and her sister, Lillian Allethea Smith Wall. Her brothers, Murray and Jerrold, both died in 2003.
While in the Navy, Jimmy Carter was away at sea much of the time. Although Rosalynn Carter struggled at home alone with their young boys, she liked seeing the country and became increasingly confident and independent.
But when Jimmy Carter’s father died in 1953 and her husband told her that they were moving back to Plains to take over the family peanut business, she became distraught. She cried and screamed, she recalled in her memoir. She couldn’t bear the thought of returning to the small town they had left, or of living so close to her strong-willed mother and her strong-willed mother-in-law.
“It was the most serious argument of our marriage,” she wrote.
And one she lost.
Back in Plains, she was miserable and mostly stayed at home. Neighbors complained that she was aloof. The farm sputtered in a drought.
Eventually, Rosalynn Carter eased into the financial side of the business, keeping the books and paying the bills. As she started advising her husband, their professional partnership began to develop, and she helped build the company into a lucrative farm supply business. It was a turning point in their relationship.
Politics Beckons
The civil rights movement brought upheaval to the South in the early 1960s. The Carters, unlike many of their neighbors, supported school desegregation, and Carter was inspired to run for office. He won a seat in the Georgia Senate and in 1966 lost his first try for the governorship. Throughout those tumultuous years, Rosalynn Carter continued to manage the business. Importantly, she overcame her terror of public speaking and immersed herself in her husband’s campaigns, helping him win the governor’s race in 1970.
“At the beginning, she was imprisoned by her shyness,” E. Stanly Godbold Jr., a Carter biographer, said in an interview for this obituary. “Once she started breaking out of her shell, she piggybacked her career onto her husband’s. Then she had a foot in both worlds, the liberated career woman as well as the supportive spouse.”
After Jimmy Carter defeated Gerald Ford for president in 1976, the first lady brought a modesty to the White House, in stark contrast to the imperial presidency of the disgraced Richard Nixon, whose resignation had put Ford, his vice president, into the Oval Office.
On Inauguration Day, the Carter family walked down Pennsylvania Avenue to No. 1600. Only Thomas Jefferson had made that trek on foot before them, in 1801; the Carters’ decision began a tradition that the nation now expects of its newly minted first families.
At the inaugural balls, Rosalynn Carter wore the same blue chiffon gown she had worn to the governor’s ball in Atlanta six years earlier.
The Carters sent their daughter to public school. They also brought her nanny, Mary Prince, to Washington. Prince had been wrongly convicted of murder in Georgia and, under a work-release program, assigned to work in the governor’s mansion. With Rosalynn Carter’s help, she received a reprieve so that she could move into the White House, a move enabled by Jimmy Carter’s having himself designated to be Prince’s parole officer. After a later reexamination of the evidence in her case, she received a full pardon.
The new first lady plunged into public affairs. At Cabinet meetings, she did not speak but frequently buttonholed Cabinet secretaries later to ask questions and then followed up with her husband.
More than 15 years before Hillary Rodham Clinton caused a stir by leading President Clinton’s effort to overhaul the nation’s health care system, Rosalynn Carter sought to upgrade the mental health system and expand services and protections for older Americans. Barred by statute from serving in an official capacity, she was named honorary chair of her husband’s mental health commission and led the White House Conference on Aging. She conducted nationwide hearings on both topics, testified before Congress and pressed for legislation.
The chief legislation she championed — the Mental Health Systems Act, which set up support and financing for community mental health centers — passed in 1980, although it was later scrapped by the Reagan administration. Another measure she had long sought — for health insurance to cover mental illness just as it covered physical illness — eventually passed but not until 2008, when President George W. Bush signed it into law.
Rosalynn Carter’s activism also had global reach. She served as her husband’s envoy to Latin America. And when she learned details of the genocide in Cambodia and the refugee crisis there, she flew to see conditions for herself. She raised millions of dollars for relief and, according to the National First Ladies’ Library, she persuaded her husband to increase U.S. quotas for refugees, permit food delivery directly into Cambodia and accelerate Peace Corps efforts in the region.
‘I Don’t Like to Lose’
As his reelection approached in 1980, with his poll numbers sagging, Carter, preoccupied by the hostage crisis in Iran, found himself largely confined to the White House and unable to campaign. The first lady stepped in as campaigner-in-chief, making speeches on the hustings and battling his challenger Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., for delegates at the Democratic convention.
Although Carter won his party’s nomination, it all came to naught in November, when Reagan decimated him at the ballot box, sweeping 44 states to Carter’s six. Rosalynn Carter did not hide her disappointment, saying she was “bitter enough for both of us.”
Their eviction from the White House at relatively young ages — he was 56, she was 53 — left them angry, morose and righteous. “I’d like people to know that we were right, that what Jimmy Carter was doing was best for our country, and that people made a mistake by not voting for him,” she wrote at the end of her memoir, adding: “I don’t like to lose.”
Eventually, they regrouped and delved into multiple projects at home and abroad.
They co-founded the Carter Center in Atlanta to promote peace, resolve conflicts and eradicate diseases. One week a year, they helped build houses for Habitat for Humanity, working on more than 4,000 homes in more than a dozen countries. And they wrote a book together, “Everything to Gain: Making the Most of the Rest of Your Life” (1987).
In 1999, the Carters jointly received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor and one rarely bestowed on a husband and wife.
Rosalynn Carter, who co-founded a nonprofit that promotes childhood immunizations, served as a deacon at the Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains and liked to go fly-fishing and bird-watching with her husband. She practiced tai chi and meditated.
But her primary cause remained trying to reduce the stigma of mental illness, an effort reiterated in the Carter Center statement in May disclosing that she had dementia.
“One in 10 older Americans have dementia,” the statement said. “We hope sharing our family’s news will increase important conversations at kitchen tables and in doctor’s offices around the country.”
In championing mental health, she served on several boards, hosted conferences and wrote books on the subject, including “Within Our Reach: Ending the Mental Health Crisis” (2010).
Recognizing the importance of caregiving, she founded and served as president of the board for the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers at Georgia Southwestern, her alma mater. She often noted that there are only four kinds of people in the world: those who have been caregivers; those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers and those who will need caregivers.
The Carter Center announced Feb. 18 this year that Jimmy Carter would live out his final days at their home in Plains. Rosalynn Carter stayed with him there, at the small one-story ranch house where, except for their four-year detour to the White House, the couple had lived since 1961.
Rosalynn Carter’s dementia had blurred some of her memories, her grandson Josh Carter told the Times in August, but she never forgot who her husband was.
They still held hands, Josh Carter said, adding: “They still sit on the couch together, in the same place they’ve always sat.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mouna Ayoub has a huge collection of haute couture, and now, 252 of her Chanel pieces designed by Karl Lagerfeld are going up for auction.
Once upon a time -- 1976, in fact -- a beautiful, poor 18-year-old Lebanese waitress named Mouna Ayoub was cleaning tables in Paris. She caught the eye of an older man, a billionaire from Saudi Arabia. They married, and he soon whisked her away from France to a life of gilded splendor in the desert kingdom.
A rags-to-riches story -- but not exactly a fairy tale. Ms. Ayoub was often lonely and unhappy. To distract herself, she threw herself into a new pastime: buying clothes. Not just any clothes, but haute couture looks made to order by a handful of Parisian houses that can cost anywhere from $ 10,000 to $ 300,000.
Today Ms. Ayoub, who divorced her husband in 1997, owns more than 2,700 pieces, making her collection of haute couture one of the world's largest. On Nov. 20, 252 pieces designed by Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel will go on sale in Paris.
The sale, called the Golden Years of Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel From the Mona Ayoub Haute Couture Collection, is organized by Maurice Auction in Paris and the British fashion auctioneer Kerry Taylor. The pieces are from the early 1990s to 2014 and include embroidered lace evening gowns, sequined cocktail suits and classic wool crepe jackets, along with classic flap bags, belts, jewelry and shoes.
So, why is Ms. Ayoub selling them now?
"Well, for one thing, I don't fit into my clothes anymore," Ms. Ayoub, 66, said. She was seated in a private salon at the Hotel Costes in Paris earlier this month and wore a monochrome tunic of graphic camellia prints with a matching bag and black patent leather knee-high boots. (All brand-new fall 2023 Chanel, of course.)
"But the real reason," she said, "is that I've carefully looked after many of these Karl pieces for 30 or 40 years now, and he is no longer with us. So it's about time they were seen and that somebody else got a chance to wear and enjoy them."
Ms. Ayoub has rules when it comes to her collection. She requires four fittings for each outfit, but preferably six. If a piece is not perfect, it will be returned. Many couture houses have their very own Mouna mannequin so that they can tailor clothes to her in case she is not available for a fitting. ("Essential," she said.)
She never wears the same dress twice, and sometimes never at all. She guessed that 90 percent of the Chanel auction lots have never been worn in public. Instead, they have been preserved in special boxes in which they lie flat and are shielded from light, dust, humidity and the archenemy -- moths -- in a high-security warehouse outside Paris.
"I am fanatical about couture," Ms. Ayoub said. "For so long it was my greatest passion." Often, she said, she acquired pieces simply for their beauty and craftsmanship.
"The world doesn't always see couture pieces as works of art, which it should," she said. "When I started buying couture in the early 1990s, it was because I wanted to protect this world and the beauty it created at a time when as a business it was under threat."
"Don't forget, my collection came from the fact I could buy what I wanted, but I couldn't publicly wear what I bought," she said, referring to restrictions on what women could wear in Saudi Arabia. "My favorite part was the fitting, with the wonderful seamstresses, and being surrounded by all the love and attention they would give you."
Part of the proceeds of the auction will go to Fondation des Femmes, a French charity for women affected by violence and abuse. Four of its shelters had been earmarked for closure after a drop in funding. Money from the sale will help keep two of them open.
Ms. Ayoub said her biggest passion now is her eight grandchildren. She still buys couture, but for a specific wedding or red carpet event. She likes Maria Grazia Chiuri at Dior and Virginie Viard at Chanel, and Giorgio Armani, but she is particularly excited by the couture creations of Daniel Roseberry, the American designer now at Schiaparelli, and Kim Jones at Fendi. She still wears a piece only once.
Was there an outfit from the auction collection that she loved the most? A long black Coromandel coat from the fall 1996 Chanel show at the Ritz in Paris, she said, where it had been modeled by Stella Tennant.
Inspired by the 18th-century Chinese lacquer screens that adorned Gabrielle Chanel's private apartment, it was said to have taken seamstresses at Maison Lesage more than 800 hours to create. In 2012, Ms Ayoub wore it to a party at a Chanel boutique, open with a black turtleneck and pants. Mr. Lagerfeld was not happy.
"He was very annoyed," Ms. Ayoub said. "He said that it was not at all how it was supposed to be worn and that it should be closed." She explained to him that she had gained weight since the 1990s and that fastening it would be impossible.
"He thought that was very funny," she said with a smile. "He said, 'Oh, Mouna, join the club!"'

Momentum Slows as Worries Rise About Profits: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Stocks drifted to a mixed finish on Thursday as Wall Street's momentum slowed after its hot first half of November.
The S&P 500 edged up by 5.36 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,508.24 and remained comfortably on track for its third straight winning week. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 45.74, or 0.1 percent, to 34,945.47, and the Nasdaq composite gained 9.84, or 0.1 percent, to 14,113.67.
Walmart weighed on the market with an 8.1 percent drop after it warned that shoppers began pulling back on spending late last month. Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, also gave a forecast for holiday profit that was weaker than analysts expected, despite topping forecasts for results in its latest quarter.
Cisco Systems tumbled 9.8 percent even though it also reported stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts estimated. The company saw a slowdown of new product orders last quarter, and it gave forecasts for earnings this quarter and fiscal year that were weaker than analysts expected.
Stocks in the oil and gas industry were particularly weak after the price of crude tumbled sharply to its lowest since July. Marathon Petroleum dropped 3.5 percent, and Halliburton fell 3.3 percent.
November nevertheless remains on track to be the S&P 500's best month in a year.
Investors are betting inflation is cooling enough to persuade the Federal Reserve to halt its increases to interest rates following its fusillade since last year. That in turn has pushed expectations up for when the Fed could begin cutting rates, which can act like steroids for financial markets, in the summer.
Several more reports on Thursday indicated a slowing economy. While the weaker-than-expected data are of course a signal the economy may be losing some of its strong momentum, for investors, they just as importantly may be showing that upward pressures on inflation is easing.
One report said that slightly more workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. The number is still low relative to history, but a softening in the job market could prevent the too-strong raises in workers' pay that the Fed fears could trigger a vicious cycle keeping inflation high.
Separate reports said that manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region is unexpectedly weakening, while U.S. industrial production weakened more than expected in October.
The Fed has been trying to shepherd the economy along a tightrope, to slow just enough to stamp out high inflation without falling into a recession. Thursday's weaker-than-expected reports strengthened investors' hopes that the Fed can pull it off and go easier on interest rates. That triggered an immediate drop in Treasury yields.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to about 4.45 percent from 4.54 percent late Wednesday. Just last month, it was above 5 percent at its highest level since 2007 and raising worries on Wall Street as it undercut prices for stocks and other investments.
Lower yields offer more breathing space for financial markets, and 45 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 rose.
Macy's jumped 5.7 percent after delivering a surprising profit for the latest quarter. Sonos leaped 17.1 percent on speculation that it may start selling headphones in the second half of its fiscal year.
A slowing economy would mean softer growth in demand for fuel, and worries are already high about swelling inventories for crude oil. That sent crude oil prices skidding sharply.
A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude for delivery in December tumbled $ 3.76 to settle at $ 72.90. Brent crude, the international standard, also dropped $ 3.76, to $ 77.42 per barrel.
In stock markets abroad, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.3 percent after Japan reported that its exports rose a meager 1.6 percent in October, down from September's growth.

New York Attorney General Sues Pepsi Over Packaging: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Letitia James claimed that the snack giant was the largest contributor to pollution along the Buffalo River, which a state survey found was contaminated with single-use plastic products.
The New York attorney general sued PepsiCo on Wednesday, accusing the food and beverage giant of endangering the environment and misleading the public about its goals to eliminate single-use plastic in its packaging.
The attorney general, Letitia James, said her office had found that much of the plastic waste along the Buffalo River was from the company's products.
Ms. James is seeking unspecified damages and demanding that the company provide a remedy for the contamination in the Buffalo region caused by its products and reduce the quantity of PepsiCo's plastic packaging entering the river. Ms. James is also demanding that the company stop selling or distributing single-use plastic products in the Buffalo area that do not contain "adequate" warning labels.
"All New Yorkers have a basic right to clean water, yet PepsiCo's irresponsible packaging and marketing endanger Buffalo's water supply, environment and public health," Ms. James said in a statement.
In 2022, the attorney general's office conducted a survey of pollution in the Buffalo River and found high levels of contamination from single-use plastic products.
A PepsiCo spokeswoman said in a statement that the company "is serious about plastic reduction and effective recycling, and has been transparent in our journey to reduce use of plastic and accelerate new packaging innovation."
"PepsiCo has been working in New York to address the needs of communities, including advocating for New York bottle bill improvements and extended producer responsibility bills," the statement added.
PepsiCo, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., makes snack foods like Lay's potato chips and Mountain Dew soft drinks. Along with other companies that have committed to sustainability, it has said it aims to make all of its packaging "recyclable, compostable, biodegradable or reusable" by 2025. The company also says it wants to cut virgin plastic by 50 percent by 2030, compared with 2020.
But Ms. James's office said that the company had not followed through so far and, in the process, has contributed to a public nuisance and a potential health hazard to New Yorkers. The office said that it surveyed around 2,000 pieces of trash along the Buffalo River and found that PepsiCo products -- wrappers, bottles and chip bags -- were the largest contributor, accounting for more than 17 percent of the identifiable trash.
Ms. James's office has recently pursued legal action against businesses for violating environmental and consumer protection laws.
In September, the attorney general announced that three recycling and cleanup companies had been convicted of illegally processing and disposing of 800 tons of electronic waste. In June, Ms. James reached a $ 6.7 million settlement with the German biotech conglomerate Bayer over making false claims to consumers about the safety of its weedkiller Roundup. And in March, Ms. James filed suit against 29 waste management companies for illegally dumping in New York.
The suit filed on Wednesday against PepsiCo is similar to one filed in 2020 in a California court against PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and other big companies by a state environmental group. That suit also claimed that Pepsi was contributing to a "nuisance" and that it was misleading consumers through labeling its packaging as recyclable.

PART TWO: MONGOLIA (May 20-26): [TStyle]

Full text: I GREW UP in India with all the major world religions. I attended a Christian boarding school in a Hindu-majority country that is roughly tied with Pakistan for the second-largest Muslim population in the world. My mother's family were Sikhs, and I counted among my closest friends a Jew from Bombay and Buddhists from Tibet. Pilgrimage is common to all of these faiths, even as it is utterly distinctive. In Islam, the pilgrimage to Mecca is an ordained pillar of faith that the Prophet Muhammad performed himself. In Christianity, the culture of cherishing relics and visiting holy places is said to have begun with Saint Helena -- the mother of Constantine I, the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity in 312 -- rushing off to the Holy Land in search of the True Cross. Some pilgrimages enshrine sorrow, like the Ashura in Iraq, which would be the last stop on my journey; others, like fiesta in Bolivia's Copacabana, are pilgrimages of joy and rapture. Some are historical, like the Jewish commemoration of exile; others, like the Mecca pilgrimage, represent the repurposing of an older sanctity, in this case that of pre-Islamic Arabia. Some pilgrimages focus on a single day, others a season, a month, an auspicious alignment of the stars. In India, which has some of the greatest scenes of pilgrimage anywhere in the world, such as the Kumbh Mela, where every 12 years the largest gathering of humanity on earth -- more than 100 million -- comes together at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, I had also witnessed the touching intimacy of a family or group of friends who set out for a holy place on a Sunday, just as someone might go fishing or to a national park in the United States.
It was the ordinariness of this latter kind of pilgrimage, away from the grand spectacles of Ashura and fiesta, that I had hoped to capture in Buddhist Mongolia. I had imagined springtime pilgrimages, people visiting monasteries as the weather warmed. If La Paz is the highest capital in the world, Ulaanbaatar is the coldest, with January temperatures reaching minus 30 degrees. In fact, even as I was setting out at the end of May, my guide and translator, Orgilbaatar Tsolmon, who goes by Orgil, was sending me videos of snow showers in the Mongolian capital.
My flight from New York connected through Istanbul; the first leg was 10 hours, and from there we flew another eight hours in a level line across the face of Asia. The Black Sea gave way to the Caspian and, beyond, to a land of mountain, desert and steppe. The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan and his descendants, poured over the steppe in the 13th century and, in the words of the 18th-century British historian Edward Gibbon, "the caliphs fell, and the Caesars trembled on their throne," even as representatives of the major faiths -- from Islam and Nestorian Christianity to Taoism and myriad forms of Buddhism -- would come before the great khans to make their case for why their particular creed ought to be the official religion of the empire.
My first glimpse of Mongolia was of rolling hills draped in thin emerald grass, of cloud shadows the size of lakes and of raking beams of morning light breaking through a heavy sky. "Nomadism," I scribbled in my notebook in a sleepless haze, "captures the very spiritual heart of pilgrimage, which is to wander." If the Latin peregrinus gives us "pilgrim," it also gives us "peregrination."
Orgil was waiting for me at Chinggis Khaan International Airport in Ulaanbaatar with a red Nissan SUV. My first thought on seeing him, with his long hair and light beard, was of the Nepalese artist Araniko's late 13th-century rendering of Kublai Khan, Genghis Khan's grandson. "In Xanadu, did Kubla Khan / A stately pleasure-dome decree. ..." The Coleridge poem was the first I had committed to memory as a child, during a blackout in Delhi, but Kublai was more than the figment of an opium dream. He was a full historical personage who founded the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368) in China and established Beijing (then known as Dadu) as its capital, and was the man whose conversion to Buddhism around 1258 brought shamanic Mongolia into the orbit of Tibetan Buddhism.
The influence of Buddhism grew sporadically for almost seven centuries in Mongolia, merging in profound ways with its ancient worship of nature -- of mountains, water, the eternal blue sky. But then, in the early decades of the 20th century, Buddhism encountered a mortal enemy: Soviet-backed Communism. Even by the standards of a tumultuous century, the Stalin-directed purges of the late 1930s stood out for their systematic eradication of Mongolia's religious culture. The great majority of the country's monastic institutions were leveled to the ground; some 18,000 monks were killed; and, in a society where about one-third of the adult male population were lamas (though not all living in monasteries), Buddhism was ripped out root and branch.
In 1990, with the fall of Communism, religious freedom was established in Mongolia and Buddhism was allowed to be practiced again. My first destination was the Khamar monastery, 300 miles south in the Gobi Desert, which had been all but destroyed in 1938. It was said to be situated at one of the portals to Shambhala -- a mythical kingdom of peace and tranquillity in the Buddhist imagining -- and had been founded in the century before by an artist, saint and sybarite called Danzanravjaa, known as the lama of the Gobi. Bolivia had given me new respect for the survival of the sacred, despite great political and historical upheavals, and I was curious to see what pilgrimage would look like in a place where it had been stamped out for generations -- curious to see the old pilgrim routes leading back to the locus of sanctity, like neural pathways reforming around an area of trauma.
MONGOLIA, BROADLY SPEAKING, is a country with half the landmass of India and a population smaller than that of Los Angeles proper -- some 3.3 million people -- of which about half live in Ulaanbaatar alone. As we left the capital's new Japanese-built airport armed with supplies of chips, Snickers, Coke Zeros and vodka as offerings, I gained a first impression of an unnerving emptiness. After some initial settlements of white yurts, or gers, as they're known here, and houses with brightly colored corrugated roofs behind dark wooden stockades, all signs of habitation fell away. On that morning in late May, spectral wisps of snow blew over the long two-lane highway, and the wind was so strong that I found it difficult to put my jacket on outside the car.
Amid what seemed like trackless wastes there periodically appeared the giant ragged form of an ovoo, or cairn. Its beanpole of a body was bandaged in blue khadags (prayer scarves), its stony mound of a base littered with vodka bottles and the occasional skull of a dead animal. The ovoo is a monument to the spirits of the natural world, known here as nagas and savdags. Orgil, following the custom of honoring these easily offended beings, lest they punish you for your neglect, honked three times as we went by. "This is the Gen Z way," he said, grinning, "but I prefer the old way," which involves circling the ovoo on foot three times in a clockwise motion.
But it was too cold to stop. It was too cold to smoke, too cold to take a pee. The temperature was only in the low 30s, but the wind bit through me, and it was hard to believe that this was a relatively mild spring day by Mongolian standards. Outside Choir, a dust-bitten town halfway to the monastery, we inhaled a lunch of mutton broth and dumplings, fried rice and a meat-stuffed pastry called a khuushuur. Then we drove on, another four hours. The land turned arid and flat. Double-humped Bactrian camels appeared along the side of the road. An enticing band of opalescent sky offered the relief of a horizon after hours of rain and snow.
Orgil, in between telling me of his days in a metal band, when "I drank beers left and right," would occasionally grow serious. "During Communism," he said, "we lost our national identity." The purges of the 1930s plundered the country's monasteries and temples -- there had been some 700 in the 19th century -- which Orgil described as repositories of folklore, history, traditional medicine and learning. Mongolia, after winning independence from Qing China in 1911, began those early decades of the 20th century as a feudal theocracy with a godlike figure, akin to the Dalai Lama, called the Bogd Khan at its helm, overseeing around 80,000 monks. (The Dalai Lama recently introduced a Mongolian child as the 10th reincarnation of the Bogd.) "They shot all the head lamas," Orgil said. "They murdered all the teachers." The fires from the monasteries were rumored to have burned for weeks. Christopher Kaplonski, a social anthropologist who has conducted research in Mongolia, has written that, though the total number of Mongolians killed between 1937 and 1939 is unknown, "credible estimates range from 35,000 to 45,000."
As evening fell, we arrived at the ger camp on the edge of the Gobi, a short drive from the Khamar monastery. We were the only ones there. Orgil had made me worried that there would be no pilgrims at all. Bolivia was a lesson in the imperishability of the sacred, but it had also shown me how places of pilgrimage, like the sacred crag on the Island of the Sun, could die. If you ban a religion for more than half a century, murder its clergy and raze its monasteries, as the Communists had in Mongolia, then maybe you do deal it a death blow?
I was full of dark thoughts when the ger camp began magically to fill. I'd just finished a dinner of banshtai tsai, dumplings in a goat milk and tea broth, and retired to my ger, where I was watching the wood-burning stove cast shadows on the wooden lattice and felt walls, when I heard electronic music blaring into the Gobi. I stepped outside to see the neat rows of gers now brightly lit, noise and chatter pouring out of their doorways. Bottles of soda were being ferried back and forth and mixed with vodka. Prim, lightly made-up girls sat on the edges of what looked like the Mongolian equivalent of a frat party. "Who are these people?" I asked Orgil in amazement. "Pilgrims," he answered. Some were part of a construction company, others students with exams on the horizon. They had come to draw energy from Shambhala. The rites the next morning were to begin before dawn, yet the pilgrim parties, with their Chaucerian feeling of intimacy among strangers, continued raucously into the night.
Just before daybreak, at 4:20 a.m., we joined a cavalcade of SUVs off-roading through the desert, drawing ruby red parabolas over the dunes. Our first stop was a fertility shrine near the monastery. On a hill were two mounds of sand and rock with stone finials, connected by a beam that was wrapped in the blue prayer cloths. Women in puffer jackets with cartons of milk went back and forth between the shrine and the edge of the hill, casting their offerings of milk into the air. Orgil told me that no man could perform the rite unless his mother had died in the past 49 days, in which case he could perform it on behalf of her spirit.
The sun rose over the Gobi, showing reddish earth and black-edged dunes. The sky was a cold, motionless blue. While the women performed the ritual, I spoke to a group of men in their late 30s and early 40s who worked for a real estate company in Ulaanbaatar. One was an economist, another a lawyer, a third a businessman. They had arrived by train from the capital. "I came here to recharge my energy and cleanse my spirit," said Egi, the economist. (Mongolians use patronymics rather than Western-style surnames; in conversation, people often go by just one name.) "This place is a world energy center." When I asked if the ritual had been handed down to him by his parents, he said, "They knew about it, but they were not authorized to come. We are the lucky generation." He added: "This Shambhala reminds us that we are not just ordinary nomads. We had an enlightened one [Danzanravjaa] live among us." Since the transition to the democratic era, Egi said, "Mongolian people have come to know that we have a great religious and cultural heritage."
Munkhdul, the businessman, said in halting English, "It's a reconnection in modern times to the past of our life." Some moments later, our band of pilgrims (about 50 to 100) reconvened outside the gateway to the Shambhala complex, where a pair of mesmeric half-closed eyes, painted on a wall of pinkish orange, gazed out at us, symbolizing the inward-turned sagacity of the Buddha. Stepping across the threshold, we found ourselves in a rectangular enclosure of red earth marked out by a perimeter of white stupas. It was like being in a Zen garden, where one proceeded from one station to another, performing a series of rituals and rites under an open sky. In the distance, the level sands of the Gobi fell away as far as the eye could see. It was an austere, heart-stopping glimpse of the void.
Our guide, Haidav, was from the Gobi region. In his early 30s now, he had been selected as a boy by Gandantegchinlen (often referred to simply as Gandan), the country's main monastery in Ulaanbaatar, to spend four years in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, where, at a center of Tibetan Buddhism -- the Namdroling monastery, popularly known as the Golden Temple -- he had been educated in the religion of his forefathers with the express aim of reintroducing it to Mongolia. As he led us into the Shambhala, he seemed less like a guide than like a monk re-educating his countrymen about a faith whose core precepts, such as the belief in karma and reincarnation, had survived the ravages of Communism, but whose rituals had to be relearned from scratch. Our group was composed almost entirely of Mongolians, but no one knew what to do at the various stations any more than I did.
At the genie's belly, a low mound of dark rocks, Haidav told us to exhale all of our sins and bad thoughts, intentional and unintentional. At the site of Danzanravjaa's ger, which was just a circle in the sand, we offered handfuls of grain. We wished that "with the help of the enlightened one, we would be reborn into the Shambhala." Then we went to three other circles representing past, present and future. Haidav told us to walk not through but around them. We had open bottles of vodka in our hands and made offerings into the air. (Milk and vodka! It was a combination I would encounter time and again in this nomadic post-Soviet society.) Haidav told us not to wish for money or material things but only that which was regenerative -- a child, rain or power. He placed a special emphasis on looking in, on harmony and balance. He said that all the bad things that happen to us, whether ill health or failure in our careers, were emanations of what was within and, in cleansing the inner sphere, we could succeed in the outer.
If pilgrimage is exteriorized mysticism, a way for human beings to grasp spiritual truths, the Shambhala felt almost like a cosmogram or mandala, a metaphysical scheme writ small. We came to a circle of red rocks that was the energy heart of the whole enclosure. Here, we sat down. Some lay on the rocks and rolled from side to side. The aim was to draw in the energy of the place. I talked to Samdanbazar, a 78-year-old herder from Töv Province, in the environs of Ulaanbaatar. She wore a gold-and-purple deel, a long coat of sorts, fur lined in the winter, with tiny earrings, her dyed hair whitening at the roots. Watching her roll back and forth, taking such obvious pleasure in the rite, I couldn't help but ask what it had been like to be denied all of this for the first 45 years of her life. "We had to hide everything," she said. "My father was a lama, so we had to hide our thangkas [Tibetan Buddhist cloth paintings], Buddhas and religious artifacts."
Our last station was the Golden Skull Hill, where a central ovoo overlooked the desert beyond. There we chanted, "Um sain amgalan boltugai" -- "may there be peace with you" -- and sang "Ulemjiin Chanar" ("Perfect Qualities"), a Mongolian folk song that Danzanravjaa had composed himself. Haidav was almost scolding in the care with which he instructed us to sing as a chorus. "Whatever your failures," he said at the end of our morning at the Shambhala, "it's because of your mind."
THE EMPHASIS ON interiority, on isolating the self as the site for spiritual advancement and failure, felt very different from the Christian pilgrimage in Bolivia. The focus there had been outward: on Mary, her miracles, on what she could give you. Here, almost everyone spoke of enlightenment from within and of certain corrosive human emotions, anger being among the gravest of them, that would impede that progress. In Mongolia, the texture of sin felt less like a crime against God than against oneself. Three symbols are often associated with Danzanravjaa's life and thought: a female figure representing his love of pleasure; a swan symbolizing the arts; and, lastly, a scorpion signifying the human potential for self-destructiveness. Outside our ger camp, there was a giant metal sculpture of a black scorpion, its tail raised, surrounded by desert sands on all sides. It stood as a reminder of the cardinal sin in the Buddhist scheme: rage, which, like the myth of the scorpion, makes us our own worst enemies, liable to sting ourselves in the head.
Kublai Khan may have laid the foundation for the rise of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia, but it was a man called Zanabazar -- a monk, scholar and artist -- who solidified its position. In everything from scripture to ritual, temple design and even religious fashion, including monastic robes with blue cuffs evoking the blue sky that Genghis Khan claimed to worship, the hand of Zanabazar is visible.
At the Erdene Zuu monastery, founded by Zanabazar's great-grandfather in the 16th century after the declaration of Tibetan Buddhism as the state religion of Mongolia, I witnessed an amazing scene, proof of the cocktail of motives that puts us on the road to pilgrimage. Erdene Zuu, with its green-tiled roofs in the Chinese style, is Mongolia's oldest monastery, built in 1586. It is also located near the ruins of the Mongol capital at Karakorum, about 530 miles from Khamar monastery. On entering Erdene Zuu's vast, grassy complex, with its perimeter wall crenelated with white stupas and nothing but big sky on all sides, I felt the spirit of a Mongolian camp. Nomadism harbors a disdain for materiality, yet it was hard not to feel myself on consecrated ground, even if only in historical terms. It was mainly from here that the descendants of Genghis Khan in the 13th century brought the world to its knees, from present-day Ukraine to Korea. The site had more recent memories, too. Of its 62 temples and some 500 facilities, the vast majority had been destroyed during the ravages of the 1930s. All around me, amid a handful of stupas and temples, were the flattened foundations of buildings in the religious complex. There had been 1,500 lamas here in the 19th century; there were fewer than 50 today. At the entrance, I spoke briefly to Mandakhtsog Monkhbaatar, who was in his early 20s, dressed in orange-and-red robes with those huge turquoise cuffs and high boots with blue piping. Like Haidav, he had spent years studying at the Golden Temple monastery in India, relearning the traditions that Communism had left Mongolian Buddhism too depleted to teach. Monkhbaatar's great-grandfather had been a prominent lama in the southwestern province of Bayankhongor. When I asked the young monk about him, he said casually, "He was murdered," then rushed into the great complex, where the morning chants were set to begin.
A plump child lama in a plumed yellow cap appeared on the wooden watchtower of a temple whose sloping white facade evoked the Potala in Lhasa, Tibet -- the winter palace of the Dalai Lamas. A conch shell sounded three times. Knots of pilgrims and tourists milling about outside drew near. Inside, monks sat chanting on wooden benches in a blue-ceilinged room hung with thangkas. Sutras wrapped in yellow silk rotated on a turnstile. As bells and chanting reached a crescendo, amid clouds of incense, a woman in a black-and-copper deel, her schoolteacher's face tremulous with ardor, came rushing in. She then began to perform full-bodied prostrations in the aisle between the monks, some chanting, others laughing or charging their phones. Again and again, as the tempo rose around her, this thin, bespectacled woman prostrated herself in ecstasy, doing what is known in Sanskrit as ashtanga pranam, or the eight-body-part salute: hands, feet, knees, chest and chin. Watching her, I was reminded of a pilgrim I had once seen at a shrine in central India. He had looked like a bureaucrat or bank clerk, the ordinariness of his appearance only amplifying the extraordinariness of his actions. I'd watched him take a rock and place it on the floor a few feet away and then lie flat on the ground face down and wriggle his way toward it. He'd repeated the same gesture several times until he circled the shrine. "This," the young Brahmin whom I'd been traveling with said to me, "is bhava" (a kind of rapture). Later, I learned that the woman at Erdene Zuu was a 40-year-old herder from Inner Mongolia, the region of the country that had remained part of China after present-day (Outer) Mongolia won its independence in 1911. She told me that she'd been a devout Buddhist since she was a child. "It's the most perfect religion because it enlightens from within," she said. But it wasn't just Buddha who had brought her to Erdene Zuu. She said she came for Genghis Khan, too. "He was our ancestor," she said of the founder of the Mongol Empire -- who was not Buddhist but shamanic. "I wanted to receive the particular energy of this man here, in what was the capital of the Mongol Empire and of Buddhism."
"So is this a religious pilgrimage for you, or a nationalistic one?" I asked.
"It is both," she said. "For Mongolians, this is a sacred place. This is ancestral land." When I asked her if she felt Chinese at all, she said, "I'm 100 percent Mongol, even if I live in the part that's China. We may live in different locations, but that doesn't change the fact that we're all Mongols."
When I asked for her contact details, she demurred, explaining that to share them was unsafe. Then, as I was walking away, she came rushing after me, imploring me not to post the pictures we had taken together on any social media or mention her by name in whatever I wrote. It was a reminder that political peril had always been part of the calculus of pilgrimage, whether in the Middle Ages, when Islam's conquest of the Holy Land gave rise to local shrines, such as Santiago de Compostela and Canterbury, or now, for this pilgrimage-within-a-pilgrimage of a Mongolian herder, honoring her ethnic and spiritual ancestor, irrespective of any national boundary.
Growing up in India, I witnessed the intersection of religion and nationalism canalized into a militarized form of pilgrimage. In 1990, the Hindu nationalist leader L.K. Advani led a rath yatra, or "chariot pilgrimage," from Somnath temple in the western state of Gujarat, where a major Hindu temple saw the first of many assaults upon it in the 11th century. The yatra, steeped in historical pain and revenge, was headed for the city of Ayodhya, a thousand miles away in Uttar Pradesh, where a 16th-century mosque -- named after the Emperor Babur, who, incidentally, was a descendant of Genghis Khan and the founder of the Mughal (derived from Mongol) dynasty -- stood on the alleged site of what was the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. The yatra was stopped before it got to Ayodhya, and Advani arrested, but the rage he had tapped into was not so easily contained. Two years later, on Dec. 6, 1992, a mob of kar sevaks, or religious volunteers, some coming as pilgrims with bricks for the construction of a new temple, destroyed the mosque. Religious riots ensued, and hundreds died. Ayodhya was the crucible that led to the ascendancy of Hindu nationalism in India. Two decades on, it gave rise to the majoritarian politics of Narendra Modi. Pilgrimage offered a release from the monotony of daily life, but it also galvanized people in the service of faith, often at the expense of other faiths, and over such a wholesale recruitment of people sent away from home full of religious zeal there forever hung the specter of a crusade.
ORGIL AND I drove some 1,500 miles in five days, off-roading over what felt like the spine of Asia: valleys of spring flowers with ancient burial sites encircled by gently creased hills of green velvet. Orgil let me drive. The full expanse of the steppe, streaked with islands of shadow, opened up around us. Sometimes the sky would darken and a storm would roll in, turning the furrowed hills a morose green; then a herd of semi-wild, rain-drenched horses might assemble at the center of the road. I had never seen such emptiness. I felt myself in a country where animals outnumbered people many times over. It was as exhilarating as it was disquieting -- the solitary sight of a ger in the distance, the cattle-covered crest of a hill dotted black, beige and white, as if the fickle hand of nature had taken up pointillism. It was easy to imagine this changeless landscape as one where people were especially attuned to the spirits of the natural world. "Throughout Mongolia it is believed," Orgil said, "that if you pollute the water, the savdag will be angry at you, so we don't even pour milk into the water, which we consider to be the purest thing." That shamanic worship had fertilized Mongolian Buddhism, giving it its distinct character, which in turn, because of the influence of Tibetan Buddhism, already included certain esoteric teachings, practices and rituals, known in classical India as the Tantras.
I hardly saw Ulaanbaatar until the end of my time in Mongolia. The location of the capital once known to Mongols as Khuree, meaning "monastery," and later to the Russians as Urga, had not been fixed until the late 1700s and, even today, the city of nearly 1.7 million has the air of a giant encampment. A suburban sprawl of ger neighborhoods -- ramshackle houses and yurts -- surround a Soviet-style city center of decaying apartment blocks and bureaucratic behemoths touched up with blue glass and steel.
Here, the Gandan monastery, the de facto Vatican of Mongolian Buddhism, was the only such institution allowed to remain partially open during Communism. Although it was closed during the purges of the late 1930s, Munkhbaatar Batchuluun, 45, a jovial lama who handled communications for the monastery, explained that it owed its survival to a cynical act of tokenism. Henry Wallace, Franklin D. Roosevelt's vice president at the time, was in Mongolia on a fact-finding mission in 1944, and the Communist government wanted to show that some modicum of religious freedom existed in Mongolia. Thus the Gandan, though hollowed out, was permitted to stay open as a Potemkin monastery. Mongolia had come as close as any society to having eradicated a religious way of life, with deep roots in the social fabric, yet here, too, as so often on this pilgrimage of mine, the sacred had triumphed in the end. The newly built main hall of the Gandan was swarming once more with pilgrims and lamas. The recitation of the sacred Ganjuur sutra -- a practice that had been repressed in Mongolia for decades, the renewal of which I was there to witness -- was underway. Sitting in the coffee shop downstairs, in a building that was a teeming complex of ATMs, broadcast studios and what Munkhbaatar referred to as "donation receiving desks," akin to cashiers at a bank, for the performance of various religious services, he described Buddhism as never really lost "but preserved in the minds of people."
As a boy in the countryside in the 1980s, he recalled his grandfather -- a lama who disrobed after the execution of his teacher -- performing Buddhist rites under cover of darkness at an altar he kept hidden in his home behind a curtain. The other villagers, who praised Communist ideals of progress by day, would by night call on his grandfather, the disrobed lama, to perform healing rites. The Buddha outlined three freedoms, Munkhbaatar explained, of behavior, speech and mind: "The Communists controlled the first two, but they could not control our minds," he said.
On my penultimate night in Ulaanbaatar, I went to meet a woman named Gerelmaa, who went by Giimaa for short, for a shamanic ceremony. She lived in a ger neighborhood in a small house, with a yard full of rubble and rotting armchairs. A white Hyundai sat on cinder blocks, framed against the setting sun. Giimaa, a stout chain smoker in her 60s with a single upper tooth, had been an East German-trained electrical engineer under Communism before becoming a shaman in 1991. She'd often travel up to 5,000 miles a year on pilgrimages to Uvs Province in the west of the country to draw energy from the place where one of her ancestors, a powerful shaman in his day, had once lived. As we sat in an upstairs room full of taxidermy birds of prey, she told me that she mostly uses her shamanic powers to help people cure illnesses and dispel dark energy.
Giimaa donned her heavy reindeer-skin coat, hung with a bear's foot, a vulture's claw, a wolf's paw and brightly colored tassels. She made offerings of milk and vodka, which her spirit, like those of most people in Mongolia, seemed to relish. With a veil over her face and feathers on her head, she began to beat a pentagonal drum, dancing about the small room.
Once the spirit took hold, Giimaa slumped down on the floor and began to speak in the gravelly voice of her male ancestor. She had told me not to be scared, but it was scary. The spirit asked about my life, and I gave him the salient details: I was the love child of a Pakistani politician and an Indian journalist. My father had been assassinated by his own bodyguard. I was married to a man from Tennessee and had been unable to return to India to see my family since 2019, when Modi's government had stripped me of my overseas citizenship only months after I wrote an article critical of his re-election.
The spirit saw darkness in my life. He asked me to envision my home in the United States and, touching me, flew there to dispel that dark energy. My mind zoomed up, too, giving me an aerial view of this scene of a shamanic ceremony in a little house with the sun setting over the hills surrounding Ulaanbaatar. I thought of my fellow pilgrims: Eduardo Quintela, and his quiet tribute to his father; Aracely Alcón, full of gratitude for Santiago's restored mobility; and the woman at Erdene Zuu on her perilous journey.
Pilgrimage in that moment seemed less to me like exteriorized mysticism and more a rite of remembrance. The world would have us forget what is painful. It would have us move on and be free of the past; but both as individuals and societies, we have our loyalties to what we have known and endured. Pilgrimage gave us the illusion of a forward movement across space, even as it allowed an inner journey toward communion with our past. It was a crystallization of the poet Joseph Brodsky's idea that "if there is any substitute for love, it's memory."

Full text: The exorbitant cost of luxury fashion has left us out in the cold, wondering who can sustain this market?
Historically, luxury fashion brands have enjoyed strong pricing power, meaning that they can apply considerable increases without necessarily losing customers. But in 2023, price tags hit eye-watering highs -- and there has been no sign of the trend slowing.
According to the data company EDITED, average luxury prices are up by 25 percent since 2019. Many brands attribute their increases to everything from inflation and the balancing out of regional price disparities to the fallout of the pandemic and impact of the war in Ukraine. But for many luxury fashion brands, the uptick has been taking place over a longer timeline.
Take Chanel, where handbag prices have more than doubled since 2016. The auction house Sotheby's found a classic 2.55 Chanel bag sold for around $ 1,650 in 2008. In 2023, that figure from Chanel is closer to $ 10,200. (If the cost had risen in line with inflation over the 15-year period, it would be expected to cost $ 2,359). This week, Pharrell Williams, the men's creative director at Vuitton, unveiled the label's new Millionaire Speedy Bag. The crocodile hide bag is made-to-order, costs a cool million and has a distinctly Scrooge McDuck aura.
"Industrywide, the pricing has gotten truly absurd," the influencer Bryan Yambao noted in an Instagram post this week when discussing a $ 6,000 woolen Miu Miu coat. "I do think this is a good time for most brands to lower their prices."
In the past year there have been signs that so-called aspirational customers, who buy entry-level luxury products like cosmetics and spirits, have curbed their spending. Middle class professionals who once saved up for a luxury investment handbag or coat have been aggressively priced out.
So who is spending $ 3,000 on a knit hat shaped like a duck from the British brand Burberry? What about $ 24,500 on a vicuña jacket by Brunello Cucinelli? Or $ 1,250 on a white cotton shirt by The Row?
The answer is the 1 percent, obviously (or those willing to incur credit card debt). Luca Solca, an analyst for Bernstein, estimates that the top 5 percent of luxury clients now account for more than 40 percent of sales for most luxury goods brands. As wealth inequality increases globally, luxury brands are doubling down on an ever smaller slice of their clientele. Will this strategy work? Or is there a backlash brewing which might force the luxury pricing bubble to burst?
The below discussion among Style journalists has been edited and condensed.
Elizabeth Paton To many people, luxury price tags have always been absurd and almost amoral. And prices in luxury fashion keep going up, and up, and up. Does it matter to customers?
Vanessa Friedman The high prices of Phoebe Philo's new line certainly struck a nerve, despite the fact they are actually at the lower end of the luxury market. It made me wonder why it was the Philo line that sparked such outrage.
Stella Bugbee It's rare to see a collection for the first time and be simultaneously confronted by the prices. We go to fashion shows and admire or critique them on a conceptual level, but often what we see on the runway doesn't make it to the store. It was also more expensive than the old Celine.
VF Although, almost everything "luxury" (including new Celine) is now more expensive than old Celine. Also, perhaps, because Phoebe has become such a mythic, fashion-savior-of-women, rightly or wrongly, and we were waiting for years for her line, a fantasy arose in which she also saved more women by making her clothes available to more people. For some of her fans these prices almost seem like a betrayal.
EP The balance between accessibility and exclusivity has always been a tricky one for luxury fashion brands, especially as the sector expanded into new markets. Now, many people who might have treated themselves with a bag are tightening their belts.
VF Well, the 1 percent are the target market for high fashion. The rest of us are left with perfume and lipstick.
EP Right, but a certain type of professional used to feel like they could save for a special piece. A Burberry raincoat. A Gucci handbag. Those are out of range for nearly everyone now.
Guy Trebay Don't forget about credit card debt, which the Federal Reserve currently pegs at over $ 1 trillion.
SB The resale economy has also changed the calculus. You can get all of those things secondhand, not long after they sell for full price.
EP And if they are hot enough items, they can sell for even more than full price! Like an Hermès Birkin for example.
VF There's a sort of warring imperative here between people who see it as a badge of honor not to buy full price and those who belong to the very tiny club that can. Economics are involved, but as much as anything, it's also psychology.
EP Resale is also a good barometer for whether pricing strategies are working. Chanel and Hermès drive the top of the resale market. More trend-driven high-fashion houses -- who have been raising their prices -- don't fare so well. If there is a market correction, it will be more directed toward brands where people take a loss on products they want to sell on the secondary market.
Jessica Testa I know of at least one resale website, the Paris-based ReSee, where Philo-era Celine is the third most popular brand, below Chanel and Hermès. And there are several independent sellers on Instagram dedicated exclusively to selling Philo-era Celine designs, fetching prices above what they cost at retail 10 years ago. There are people who spend years hunting eBay for one specific product in their size.
VF Which brings me back to Phoebe Philo's current scarcity model: We don't even know how much of any piece they produced (the company wouldn't say) but the message is the market will bear the prices, since the products are sold out. We think because it is more expensive, it has more value.
GT This is the stuff for which Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel. Subjects shown two identical cashmere sweaters, one at a far higher price, inevitably chose the more costly of the two. His point was that we don't think. We act irrationally.
VF I go back to the idea of betrayal. Because so many women relate to Phoebe Philo as a person, or at least the idea of Phoebe and what her work once represented, they felt excluded or ill-served by the pricing of her new line. They cared deeply about what she was going to make, and then it seemed as if she didn't really care at all about including them.
EP Also that Phoebe -- and the powers that be in luxury -- spent a considerable period courting aspirational audiences. It's just now they're pulling the drawbridge up. Fashion is always at risk of looking out of touch with the wider world, and certain items that seem to have gone viral on social in recent months -- like the Burberry duck hat -- triggered particular wrath, more so than usual.
VF Burberry is also selling a $ 21,000 viscose dress with a Burberry knight riding across the front.
GT Better at that point to pin dollar bills to your chest.
EP Speaking of dollars, a quarter of a trillion them have been wiped off the value of Europe's seven biggest luxury businesses since April, and sales are generally down across most fashion groups. That is the aspirational middle class stepping away from the credit card machine.
JT My pet peeve is when high-end brands collaborate with mass-market brands and yet the pricing doesn't even meet in the middle -- it's still $ 900.
EP Like the recent Banana Republic collaboration with Peter Do.
GT And that's relatively new. By contrast, there were the wonderful and completely affordable collabs Jil Sander, Tomas Maier and others did with Uniqlo.
JT Guy Trebay may have complimented my Clare Waight Keller Uniqlo bag a mere two days ago, folks.
EP The collabs do occasionally have some treasures!
VF In a sense they give the luxury brands an excuse for their pricing, because they can say, "Well, but we did this or that mass market collab."
EP I agree and I don't think we will see this approach by the luxury powers changing anytime soon. The bubble doesn't seem to be bursting -- yet.

Harvard, Columbia and Penn Take Steps to Fight Campus Antisemitism: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The universities are trying to address criticism by banning pro-Palestinian student groups, condemning slogans and starting task forces to address antisemitism.
Over the last month, university presidents have been battered by a vocal cohort of alumni and faculty members who have accused them of not being strong enough in their denunciations of antisemitism in the wake of the Hamas attack on Israel.
Now at some high-profile universities that have faced heavy criticism -- including Harvard, Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania -- presidents are trying to take more direct action to address those concerns about antisemitism.
Columbia suspended two pro-Palestinian student groups on Friday.
At Harvard on Thursday, the university's president, Claudine Gay, condemned the phrase "from the river to the sea," which has been called divisive and antisemitic.
At the University of Pennsylvania, the president, Elizabeth Magill, spoke forcefully against antisemitic rhetoric.
And all three universities formed task forces to address antisemitism on campus.
"Let me reiterate what I and other Harvard leaders have said previously: Antisemitism has no place at Harvard," Dr. Gay wrote in an announcement on Thursday. "While confronting any form of hatred is daunting, the challenges we face tackling antisemitism are made all the more so by its pernicious nature and deep historical roots. But we are committed to doing the hard work to address this scourge."
Their moves, however, may not quell the anger among donors.
And the actions may only fuel the resolve among pro-Palestinian student activists, who say that they are only speaking up for marginalized, oppressed people living in Gaza. The criticism, they say, is nothing but an attempt to stifle speech and divert attention from a 16-year blockade of Gaza by Israel, backed by Egypt, that has devastated the lives of Palestinians. In addition, many pro-Palestinian students point out that they have faced doxxing and harassment -- and they are asking on social media for similar efforts against Islamophobia.
Columbia announced on Friday that it would ban Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace through the end of the fall term, saying that they had violated university policies. The groups have been at the center of weeks of intense demonstrations that have sharply divided students and shaken Columbia's Manhattan campus. The most recent action, including a walkout, attracted roughly 300 students on Thursday.
Gerald Rosberg, the university's executive vice president, said in a statement that Thursday's event "included threatening rhetoric and intimidation" and that the groups had taken their actions "despite warnings" not to do so.
The university's decision will bar the group from holding events on campus or receiving university funding through the end of the fall semester.
"During this especially charged time on our campus, we are strongly committed to giving space to student groups to participate in debate, advocacy and protest," Mr. Rosberg said. But, he added, groups would have to abide by university rules that require them to receive approval for large gatherings and cooperate with the administration.
Sonya Meyerson-Knox, communications director for Jewish Voice for Peace, a pro-Palestinian group, called Columbia's action a "horrific act of censorship and an attempt at intimidation," adding that the students from both groups were doing exactly what they should do -- "standing up against war and calling for a cease-fire to save lives."
Although universities have occasionally tussled with S.J.P. chapters over the years, Columbia's decision was at least the second punitive action against the network this week.
On Monday, Brandeis University, near Boston, banned its local S.J.P. chapter from holding activities on campus.
In a notice to the group obtained by The New York Times, Brandeis accused the national steering committee of encouraging chapters "in conduct that supports Hamas in its call for the violent elimination of Israel and the Jewish people." Such behavior, the notice said, was "not protected by the university's principles."
S.J.P. members have insisted that the group is not inherently antisemitic, but researchers and Zionist groups have sharply critiqued that assertion.
At Penn, Ms. Magill, the president, has faced a fierce, but thus far unsuccessful, campaign to oust her, led by Marc Rowan, the chief executive of Apollo Global Management and the board chairman at Wharton, the university's business school. He has accused her of tolerating antisemitism after a Palestinian writers conference took place on campus.
She, too, has issued a series of statements that have tried to quell the donor revolt.
On Thursday, she announced that the university was investigating "vile, antisemitic messages" that had been projected onto several campus buildings.
"For generations, too many have masked antisemitism in hostile rhetoric," Ms. Magill said in her message. "Projecting hateful messages on our campus is not debate, it is cowardice, and it has no place at Penn."
At Harvard, Dr. Gay, beyond administrative moves and statements, has reached out directly to her Jewish constituents. She delivered remarks at the first Shabbat dinner after the Hamas attack. The Oct. 13 dinner, sponsored by Chabad, the Jewish organization, was attended by about 1,000 people, mainly students but also some faculty members, alumni and donors.
Dr. Gay said that over the course of a challenging week, she had learned a lot not only about "the aching pain and grief" of worrying about loved ones in Israel, but about "the pain and grief that many of you've been experiencing on our campus for years."
She paused to let that sink in before adding: "And what I want to say is that Harvard has your back."
She got a standing ovation. But her statements, at least up to now, have not seemed to pacify the critics.
Late last month, the school's Jewish Alumni Association sent an open letter, signed by more than 1,600 students and alumni, that acknowledged Ms. Gay's remarks, but called for more action to denounce antisemitism.
On Thursday, Whitney Tilson, a former hedge fund manager and a Harvard alumnus, said that he was so angry at Harvard for not standing up to antisemitism that he had declined an invitation to meet with a fund-raising officer from the business school.
"The damage that Harvard has done to its brand since Oct. 7 is only rivaled in history by New Coke and what Elon Musk has done to Twitter," he wrote.
Mr. Tilson said on Friday that he considered Harvard "the least needy charity on earth" and that he had made only "a few tiny donations over the years."
"But," he added, "I also have a megaphone: I sent that email to nearly 10,000 friends and readers on some of my many email lists."

Celebrating a Marriage and 'a Second Chance at Life': [Society Desk]

Full text: When Adam Jankelowitz was 2, he received a liver transplant. Decades later, he finally got to thank the donor's parents in person -- at his wedding with Jill Schreider.
Neither Jill Meredith Schreider nor Adam Jesse Jankelowitz drinks much alcohol -- if any. But on their first date, both were too polite to interrupt the server's lengthy presentation about the restaurant's four-page tequila menu.
They matched on the dating app Plenty of Fish in December 2019, and had their first date at Temazcal Tequila Cantina in Dedham, Mass. -- halfway between where Mr. Jankelowitz lived in Sharon and Ms. Schreider's home in West Roxbury.
Near the start of the date, Mr. Jankelowitz told Ms. Schreider that he had a liver transplant when he was 2 because of tyrosinemia, a genetic disorder characterized by the body's inability to break down the amino acid tyrosine.
"Immediately I was invested," Ms. Schreider said.
Mr. Jankelowitz takes a daily anti-rejection drug and can't drink alcohol at all. Ms. Schreider, on the other hand, might have a cocktail on a special occasion, but she generally prefers a Diet Coke.
They bonded over the fact that they were both close to their grandmothers and had connections to Boston University. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr. Jankelowitz was a season-ticket holder of the university's hockey team for 18 years. Ms. Schreider, a social worker, holds a Master of Social Work degree from the school and teaches in the social work program as an adjunct professor.
A few days after their first date, they met again over burgers, and they continued seeing each other regularly over the next few months. The beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 forced a decision: whether they would form a quarantine pod. While they didn't move in together then, they spent most of the lockdown working remotely in an apartment Mr. Jankelowitz's father owned in Amherst, Mass.
Mr. Jankelowitz, 35, has a bachelor's degree in history from Plymouth State University in Plymouth, N.H. He is a pharmacy compliance analyst with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts in Hingham, Mass.

Ms. Schreider, 37, has a bachelor's degree in education from Lesley University in Cambridge, Mass. Besides teaching at Boston University, she works as a family services coordinator at Baby University, a support program by the city of Cambridge that serves families with toddlers and infants.
In May 2021, Mr. Jankelowitz moved into Ms. Schreider's condominium in West Roxbury. A few months later in November, during a routine medical checkup, Mr. Jankelowitz's doctor asked if he wanted to contact the parents of his liver donor. When Mr. Jankelowitz brought it up with Ms. Schreider, she encouraged him.
"I thought this could be so powerful for them, too," Ms. Schreider said of the parents.
"Jill is so caring and always makes sure I do the right thing," Mr. Jankelowitz said.
Soon he exchanged emails and had a video call with his donor's parents -- Alrick and Sherri Hale -- in Whitefish, Mont. Their son Hunter, the second of four children, had died as a baby from sudden infant death syndrome. The Hales donated Hunter's heart, liver and corneas to three different children. So far, Mr. Jankelowitz has been the only recipient to contact them.
One evening at home in January of this year, Mr. Jankelowitz asked Ms. Schreider if she would like to be engaged -- in his characteristically low-key way. He proposed with his maternal grandmother's diamond ring. Known in the family as "Bubba," she had been very close to Mr. Jankelowitz. She had died earlier that month because of complications from the coronavirus.
Ms. Schreider quickly said yes. "Adam has this quiet but warm presence, and our values are really aligned," she said.
They were married on Oct. 29 in front of 133 guests at the Inn on Boltwood in Amherst by Rabbi Karen Landy, the manager of religious and spiritual care services at Hebrew SeniorLife in Boston.
During the reception, Mr. Jankelowitz made a toast to the Hales: Despite their heartbreaking loss, they "gave me a second chance at life," he said. "It's the best gift I'll ever get." The Hales received a standing ovation.
The wedding also fell on the Hales's 40th wedding anniversary. When the Hales received a save-the-date notice, they said, there was no question that they would attend. The Friday before the wedding, the two couples met in person for the first time over dinner in Boston. The couples also have other little details in common: Both Mr. Jankelowitz's mother and Ms. Hale's grandmother are named Esther, for example.
"There's some sort of divine intervention or guardian angels at work here," Ms. Hale said. "It was definitely meant to be."

Nicola Walker and the Book That Opened Her World: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: When it comes to the actress's favorite things, give her the American version of "Alone" and a true-crime podcast from Australia.
No one broods quite like Nicola Walker, whose eyes have transfixed viewers in television shows like "Unforgotten," "Last Tango in Halifax" and "The Split."
In "Annika," the British crime drama now in its second season on PBS, she holds that gaze as a marine homicide detective, her speedboat slicing through the waters near Glasgow.
But in a video interview while just outside London, where she lives with her husband, the actor Barnaby Kay, and their teenage son, Harry, Walker was radiant and witty. When she agreed to talk about her cultural essentials -- true-crime podcasts, the theater director Ivo van Hove, the harrowing reality series "Alone" -- she recalled her agent asking if she was going to be truthful.
"I said, 'Is it bad if I tell them that really one of my cultural highlights this week has been sitting in my underwear, eating a bag of Spanish Lays crisps with a can of Coke, watching the 'Beckham' documentary?"'
"Now I'm in love with both of them," Walker added. "David and Victoria."
These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Touching the Art
When I was a young girl, we moved to rural Essex, and the nearest town was Harlow -- one of the new towns built post-World War II. Frederick Gibberd, the architect, thought that ordinary people should brush up against art in their everyday lives. On the way to the shopping center, I'd walk past sculptures by Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Rodin. I used to climb all over Hepworth's "Contrapuntal Forms," and no one ever stopped you. Hepworth said statues must be touched -- that's how they begin.
Stewart Lee
I've always loved stand-up because I could never do it, and Stewart is, for me, the best stand-up working for years now. I recommend "Content Provider." It's like he smashes up the rules of comedy, glues them back together and then throws them at you.
Ivo van Hove
Watching Ivo or being directed by Ivo is like having an injection of energy and hope, because he makes theater in a way that you realize you've always wanted theater to be made.
Toni Morrison
I lost my mother a very long time ago. Too young. She bought me a copy of "Beloved" when I went up to university, and she wrote in it, "To My Beloved." That thing they say about what you would save from your burning house, apart from pets? That book. I was 19, and it opened up the whole world.
The U.S. Version of 'Alone'
The U.K. one was like a family camping trip gone wrong: They've got lost in the dark and they're scared of the foxes and the owls hooting. Then we happened to see "Alone USA." Crikey. Ten people. Bears, wolverines. I watched a man win a series because he shanked a musk ox to death.
'Closing Time'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
When I was pregnant, I played "Closing Time" on a loop, and Harry used to sort of wriggle. I don't know whether I've made that up, but all I know is he loves Tom Waits. When Harry was about 3, I went for a fitting at a famous costumier, and Tom Waits walked in. I was too scared to say, "My 3-year-old knows all the words to 'Closing Time."' I really regret it, and my son has never forgiven me.
Sylvia Plath
When I was 16, I really identified with her. All that introspection of youth. You're allowed to be that doom-laden because you're so young. As a 53-year-old, I don't see myself. I see Sylvia Plath, and I want to literally jump in the book and save her.
Reciting Poetry
I love reading poetry out loud. This might be due to studying English at Cambridge. One of my favorite poems is Billy Collins's "Introduction to Poetry" -- the idea that you have to tie the poem down to a chair and beat it into submission to give up its meaning. I felt that's what I did as a student, and it took me ages to find my way back to poetry because, for me, it was work. But now I think it's flesh and bones when you say those words.

Playlists for Roles
They give me the confidence to step out of the caravan and walk on set. Annika's playlist was fabulously eclectic: Benjamin Clementine's "Nemesis," David Bowie's "Fill Your Heart," The Darkness's "I Believe in a Thing Called Love."
Murder Shows
I have a guilty obsession that a lot of women have (as "S.N.L." pointed out in a very good musical skit): true crime. There's this Australian podcast, "Casefile," and the guy always starts with this warning, "This podcast contains stories of a sexual nature, injury to women," or whatever. And my husband's shouting, "Are you listening to that bloody man talking about killing women again?" Yeah, I am. Why am I? It's the same reason we like crime dramas. Because the comfort of watching something that terrifies you and seeing it resolved makes you feel a little bit safer.

Full text: The so-called iPhone giveaways marketed by Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T can make customers spend more on perks they don't need.
There's no such thing as a free iPhone.
But phone carriers would like you to believe otherwise. Over the last few weeks, AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile have blitzed their websites, billboards and stores with ads proclaiming that you can "get the iPhone 15 Pro, on us."
To get this $ 1,000 iPhone for $ 0, the carriers say, all you have to do is trade in an older phone and sign up for a wireless plan. In reality, the phone freebie promotions can lure smartphone owners into spending more in the long run by requiring them to subscribe to more exorbitant service plans bundled with superfluous features, such as big high-speed data packages and subscriptions to streaming services.
I spent several days plugging numbers into the carriers' websites and chatting with store representatives to get some realistic out-the-door numbers. To test the promotions, I submitted a three-year-old iPhone 12 as a hypothetical trade-in. (On average, people upgrade to a new phone every three years.)
Here were the costs of getting the new iPhone 15 Pro through the promotions, excluding taxes:
Verizon's free iPhone deal would cost about $ 3,240 over the 36 months required to redeem the promotion, roughly $ 300 more than buying the new iPhone with a cheaper Verizon plan in the same period.
AT&T's deal would cost a customer about $ 2,675 over the 36 months required to redeem the promotion, a little bit more than doing a trade-in for the new phone and selecting a cheaper AT&T plan.
T-Mobile's promotion would cost $ 2,400 over two years to redeem the phone credit, about $ 160 more than buying the new iPhone with a cheaper T-Mobile plan.
"People who think they're getting free phones from the carrier are in for a surprise," said Toni Toikka, the chief executive of Alekstra, a consulting firm that helps businesses reduce their cellphone bills.
Verizon said that customers could choose which plan was best for them, and that the promotions were intended for people looking for the best network experience. T-Mobile said that deals were not just about free phones and it strove to provide the best value with its premium plans that include perks like Netflix streaming and the flexibility to upgrade frequently. AT&T declined to comment.
If you are looking to save a buck, it is always a good idea to trade in your old phone for credit to shave down the cost of a new one. Just be wary of any promotion offering a freebie.
Let's dive deeper into the iPhone giveaway promotions advertised by Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile. Then I'll share some better ways to save money with trade-ins.
Verizon
Verizon's requirements to get a free iPhone 15 Pro are the most aggressive. Trading in an iPhone 12 can earn you $ 1,000 in the form of bill credits spread out over 36 months. To be eligible, I had to choose a $ 90-a-month wireless service plan called Unlimited Ultimate. The total cost over the three years would be $ 3,240.
In contrast, if I traded in the iPhone 12 and picked one of Verizon's cheaper plans, like the $ 65-a-month Unlimited Welcome, a basic cellular plan with unlimited data, Verizon would offer $ 415 for the three-year-old iPhone. The total to buy and use an iPhone 15 Pro on the cheaper plan for three years would be $ 2,925.
The main benefit of Verizon's pricier Unlimited Ultimate plan is that it offers 60 gigabytes of mobile hotspotting, which allows you to share a phone's cellular data connection with a computer. Some people may want this feature, but most will not need it -- only 4 percent of mobile users consume more than 50 gigabytes of cellular data a month, according to a report by the technology conglomerate Cisco.
So with Verizon's free iPhone promotion, you would spend $ 315 more over three years for a plan with fancy perks than if you traded in your old phone and picked a cheaper Verizon plan.
AT&T
AT&T is offering up to $ 1,000 off the iPhone 15 Pro with an eligible trade-in. Only the most recent and most expensive smartphones, like last year's iPhone 14 Pro, are eligible for the full $ 1,000 in credit. Older phones get less.
AT&T provided a promotional credit of $ 700 for the three-year-old iPhone 12 in the form of discounts spread out over 36 months of bill payments. That brought the cost of the iPhone 15 Pro to $ 8.30 a month spread out over three years.
To get the promotion, I also had to choose one of AT&T's eligible data plans, which start at $ 65 a month. All told, including one-time fees, the cost of buying an iPhone 15 Pro and using it on AT&T's network with an eligible plan over three years came out to $ 2,675.
In contrast, if I traded in the iPhone 12 and picked one of AT&T's cheaper plans, like the $ 50 Value Plus plan, AT&T would offer $ 200 in credit for the older phone, which shaves the price of the iPhone 15 Pro down to $ 800. Over the course of 36 months on the cheaper plan, the total would be $ 2,635.
The main difference between the $ 50 plan and the $ 65 plan is that the latter offers three gigabytes of mobile hotspotting.
This means you are not getting a free iPhone from AT&T through this promotion. Instead, you would pay roughly $ 40 extra over three years for a plan with a mobile hot spot feature.
T-Mobile
T-Mobile is offering to make the iPhone 15 Pro free once you trade in your older phone and sign up for its Go5G Next plan, at $ 100 a month. The free iPhone comes in the form of bill credits spread out over 24 months. Over two years, you pay about $ 2,400.
But if you sign up for the cheaper Essentials plan at $ 60 a month, which is not part of the promotion, T-Mobile will offer $ 200 for the iPhone 12. After you buy the iPhone 15 Pro for $ 800, the total cost over two years would be $ 2,240.
T-Mobile's cheaper Essentials plan includes 50 gigabytes of high-speed data, which is more than enough. The Go5G Next plan includes unlimited high-speed data and subscriptions to Netflix and Apple TV+.
Once again, you are not really getting a free iPhone, but are paying roughly $ 160 more over two years for extra data and streaming services.
"Consumers may find it challenging to determine whether the more expensive plan offers additional value," Mr. Toikka said.
Bottom Line
Promotions are temporary, so once the terms expire, the wireless service rates will probably shoot up -- and you could end up spending more without noticing.
But don't let these promotions discourage you. It's still a great idea to sell your old phone to save some bucks on a new one, and there are a plethora of trade-in programs online.
Sites like Gazelle, Best Buy, Amazon and Swappa offer cash or store credit for your old phone, and their quotes for used phones are usually higher than the phone carriers'. To reduce costs of your phone, shop around for the best offer and pick a wireless plan that suits your budget and needs.
I recently sold my wife's iPhone 12 through Gazelle for $ 312 in cash, which she used toward buying an iPhone 15 directly from Apple. That shaved the price of the new phone down to about $ 500, and she stuck with the cheap family plan that she has used for years with her siblings.
That's a far cry from free. But it beats burning extra cash on a fancy wireless package she won't use.

'In Egypt Now. Free!': First Evacuees From Gaza Are Safe, and Relieved: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "You feel that human beings' lives are so worthless," said Ala Al Husseini, 61, an Austrian-Palestinian dual national who was allowed to leave Gaza on Wednesday.
There was little gas and no phone service in Gaza on Wednesday morning, making it impossible to hail a cab, so Ala Al Husseini nearly missed his chance to escape the war.
When someone eventually agreed to give him a ride to the border crossing with Egypt, where he could use his Austrian passport to leave Gaza, he and the driver crept through the gray, shattered streets in a state of icy dread, wondering if they could be killed in an airstrike simply for passing what Israel might consider a military target -- just two more pieces of collateral damage.
As if watching a film, he pictured his children, his Ph.D., his university teaching work, his wife.
"I was thinking this could all go away just by someone pressing a button of an F-16," said Mr. Al Husseini, 61.
Instead, by the next morning, he was safe in Cairo, hugging his brother.
"There were lots of tears," he said by phone on Thursday, the day before he was supposed to fly to Austria to reunite with his wife and children. "Getting out of a war zone is something like a new life."
Mr. Al Husseini was among the first few hundred people to leave Gaza since the war erupted a month ago, all of them saved by their foreign passports or other legal ties to the outside world. Weeks of intensive negotiations among Israel, Egypt, the United States, Hamas and Qatar, which often acts as a diplomatic intermediary for Hamas, had yielded an agreement for the dual citizens, foreigners and their families, as well as Palestinian staff members of international organizations, to leave Gaza through its border with Egypt.
But reaching safety was hardly as simple as showing up at the border, foreign passport in hand, as several evacuees described in interviews with The New York Times.
Some of the would-be evacuees went repeatedly to the Rafah crossing over the last three weeks after hearing it might open, only to find the gate shut. Rumors and confusion abounded as news spread that the crossing was open this week, prompting many people to head there even though they were not yet scheduled to depart. The lack of internet and spotty phone connections meant some people might not even have heard that they were on the list to leave.
On the appointed day, the evacuees first had to find a car with enough gas to travel -- and a driver with enough nerve to take them. Then there was the ride to the border, then the long line of people, all quietly impatient, followed by hours of waiting in the departures hall of the border crossing.
Next came the nerve-racking moment where officials checked travel documents against a list of names compiled by foreign embassies and approved by Israel, Egypt and Hamas. Then the bus ride from the Palestinian side to the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing, followed by more waiting and more document-checking in the arrivals hall.
Finally, they emerged through a dun-colored archway with an Egyptian flag rippling over it, and they were in Egypt -- safe. Safe, after more than three weeks in which every day they had thought that they might die.
"In Egypt now. Free!" Ramona Okumura, a Seattle resident who was volunteering in Gaza for the Palestine Children's Relief Fund when the war broke out, texted a Times journalist on Wednesday evening.
About 340 dual nationals from Bulgaria, Finland, Indonesia, Japan, Jordan and elsewhere, as well as employees from around the world of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders and other aid groups, crossed on Wednesday. Another group of about 340 people, among them more than 100 Americans, crossed on Thursday.
So much depended on the bureaucratic minutiae of passports and visas, on the long, unwieldy list that determined whether someone could cross -- and, perhaps, whether she or he would survive.
Dalal Abu Middain, an American citizen, and her family turned back on Thursday because crossing would have meant leaving her 6-year-old daughter, Maha, who was rejected from crossing, despite having U.S. citizenship.
Abdallah Dahalaan, 76, an Australian dual citizen, chose to stay in Gaza because his wife, Samah, was not on the list.
"She said, 'Just go, and then we'll see what happens after.' I said, 'No, I'm not going,"' Mr. Dahalaan said by phone on Wednesday. "Imagine leaving your partner behind. It's just -- it's not the right thing to do."
So they rejoined the more than two million people who remain trapped in Gaza, those with no prospect of escaping the hunger, thirst or Israeli bombardment they have endured since Oct. 7. That was when the decades-old conflict exploded again with an attack on Israel by the armed Palestinian group Hamas that killed more than 1,400 people. In response, the Israeli military launched an all-out campaign against Gaza.
Mr. Al Husseini's 84-year-old mother and his brother's children could not leave, either.
In Gaza, "you feel that human beings' lives are so worthless," Mr. Al Husseini said. Most Gazans, he said, are "not Hamas -- they are normal people who have their own lives. They work in banks and companies and live normal lives, and now these lives are completely shattered."
Weeks of Israeli airstrikes have killed more than 9,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry, among them multiple dual citizens hoping to leave. On Thursday morning, the sound of a nearby airstrike rattled the people waiting to cross at Rafah, and a piece of shrapnel appeared to fall on the metal canopy of the terminal area.
Israel's siege of Gaza is preventing fuel from entering the enclave, and also limiting water and food access to aid shipments that fall far short of the population's basic needs.
Daily life in Gaza has withered to an endless, humiliating quest for the essentials.
Every day, "I have one son waiting in the bakery line, the other one in the water line and the third in the cellphone charging line," said Rania Abunahla, 43, a Jordanian dual citizen hoping to cross on Wednesday. "When the shelling starts, I don't know who I should check on first."
On Wednesday and Thursday morning, some evacuees arrived by foot, others by donkey cart, lugging all the baggage they could. Then they crowded in to wait. The mood was tense, edging toward relief.
Halfway around the world in Colorado, three weeks of agony were coming to an end for Danny Preston. His mother, Dr. Barbara Zind, a Colorado pediatrician, was volunteering with the Palestine Children's Relief Fund when the war erupted.
When she heard the border might open for foreigners weeks ago, Dr. Zind, 68, was so optimistic about leaving that she gave away much of her clothing to others who needed it more. She spent the rest of her time in Gaza sleeping in jeans in the basement of a U.N. building, the parking lot of a U.N. school and the kindergarten playroom of another building, her son said.
He said her group had come close to running out of food and water twice before being resupplied -- the first time by a Nigerian team from Mercy Corps, the second by a member of her group who volunteered to make the dangerous drive to northern Gaza to get more provisions after the rations had dwindled to about 900 calories per person, per day.
On Tuesday night, she and her group of fellow volunteers heard from the State Department that they should head to the border by 7 a.m. This time, it felt real.
It helped that they could see things happening by midmorning. Ambulances were transporting critically injured Palestinians from Gaza into Egypt for treatment. Officials were scanning documents.
Roughly seven hours later, she was through, getting in a car bound for Cairo.
"So tired," Dr. Zind texted her son on Wednesday night from the Egyptian side of the crossing. "Didn't eat all day until I got a Coke and chips" while waiting to be processed there, she added, joking: "Will have to detox when I get home."
Mr. Preston said his mother regularly volunteers in Gaza, the West Bank and Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. When he asked her how she felt about leaving Gaza behind at a time of great need, she responded that her work -- treating chronically ill children -- was now impossible, given the shortages of everything from food to fuel to medicine.
But she was already planning to come back to Gaza when she could.
"I know that this is what she does, and I'm really proud of her for it," he said. "And I don't know if I would be able to talk her out of it."
Like Dr. Zind, Ms. Abunahla, the Jordanian dual citizen, spent hours waiting at the crossing on Wednesday. Then she learned that her three sons, ages 14, 20 and 22, were not on the list with her, assurances from Jordan's foreign ministry notwithstanding.
Her husband had already chosen to stay in Gaza to take care of his parents. She could not face breaking her family up further.
"Everybody was telling me to leave, but how? How can I leave my sons behind?" she said, dazed from her sudden descent from hope into despair. "I've lost the chance to leave. It looks like I'm staying here."

Matthew Perry and the Loneliness of Addiction: [Op-Ed]

Full text: A long time ago, I lay awake for hours, terrified that they would be my last ones on earth. I had committed myself to quitting cocaine, which was my second addiction, the first being years of amphetamines. I was devoting myself to cleaning up and getting healthy. But then a friend called who I had routinely done coke with and who always had a supply of the drug. Earlier on that black night, I'd careened backward into the familiar land of white lines on a mirror and a heart racing way too fast. It was pounding so hard, so fast, so loud, I was certain it and I couldn't survive.
I saw the fact that I did survive as somewhat of a miracle. It would be a nice, clean story if I said I never did drugs again. But addiction is never nice and clean. I did go back to trying to clean up my life, and truthfully I backslid only a couple of times after that -- and never as severely as on the night I thought might be my last.
I don't think back on those days too often, but with Matthew Perry's death, the memories have coiled around me because of how honest he was about his own addiction. I want to tell you something about addiction: No matter who it is or what substance that person is hooked on, loneliness is at its root. For whatever reason -- and I have no theory as to why -- there are those of us who feel isolated in this world, as if everyone else had some secret formula for getting along, for fitting in, and no one ever let us in on it. That loneliness resides deep inside us, at our core, and no matter how many people try to help us, no matter how many friends reach out, support us, show up for us, it never entirely goes away. It's vast and shadowy and also part of who we are. Something happens when we discover a drug or alcohol: Suddenly we have a companion holding our hand, propping us up, making us feel we fit in, we can be part of the club. It's there for us in the empty hours when it seems no one else is.
"Nobody wanted to be famous more than me," Mr. Perry said at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books in April. But, he added, "fame does not do what you think it's going to do." I remember hearing him say that and thinking, "Right -- it doesn't penetrate that loneliness." I wonder if he ever realized how brave he was to reach past his pain and hone a talent that would make people laugh.
He discovered alcohol at 14. I was 16 when I discovered amphetamines, and I felt as if I had met my best friend. Suddenly I felt I was livelier, more entertaining, not the shy, nearsighted girl who felt uncomfortable around people. To understand an addict, you need to appreciate that companionship, that need to reach for what won't judge you but will instead seem to transform you into who you wish you were.
Mr. Perry spoke about being lonely. He wrote about it in his book, "Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing," and he talked about it in the context of longing for a relationship. I wondered if he knew that even the joy and fulfillment of a relationship don't fill up that insecure place deep inside some of us. When I quit drugs for good, I had to accept that this was just part of who I am; I didn't have to fix it or try to obliterate it. That hadn't worked anyway. I had followed the white lines of coke right back to who I was -- the person who felt she needed to use drugs to live.
We may never know what Matthew Perry's emotional state was at the time of his death. Had he come to terms with the fact that fame made addiction so much harder to bear -- but also allowed him to help others, through the story of his journey and through the sober living house he created? "The best thing about me, bar none, is that if somebody comes to me and says, 'I can't stop drinking, can you help me?' I can say 'yes' and follow up and do it," he said on the "Q With Tom Power" podcast.
He laid bare his wounds, his struggles, his complicated relationship with drugs and alcohol. That's the best we can do in life -- be truthful and hope those truths become lanterns for others as they wander through the dark. My biggest hope is that he knew he had fulfilled his wish.

Ukraine, Defending a Prized City, Fights a Pivotal Battle on a Slag Heap: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tall chimneys of the Avdiivka Coke Plant stand out against the skyline. Beside it a sprawling slag heap juts into the sky, offering a high point overlooking the city of Avdiivka and surrounding villages.
The two landmarks have been the focus of furious fighting since Oct. 10 as thousands of Russian troops began a major new offensive in eastern Ukraine to seize Avdiivka, a long-coveted prize that would extend Russia's control of the coal mining region of the Donbas.
Yet within days this battle for Avdiivka was shaping up to be perhaps the costliest of the war for Russia. Ukrainian artillery destroyed Russian armored columns on the approaches to the city, and drones armed with explosives struck down infantry as they dismounted from vehicles and advanced on foot, according to Ukrainian soldiers and commanders, Russian military bloggers and independent military analysts.
Waves of Russian soldiers scaled the industrial waste heap to gain its heights. Each time they were shredded by Ukrainian artillery.
Nearly three weeks into the battle, the Russian army has failed to make the swift breakthrough it wanted. It has lost hundreds of men and more than 100 armored vehicles and tanks, the Institute for the Study of War reported, and twice that amount by Ukrainian accounts. In the main direction of the attacks, it has advanced barely a mile, and in other places only a few hundred yards.
As both sides have found in nearly two years of heavy artillery battles, a mechanized assault against a strong defensive line is always a brutal experience.
The Ukrainians are taking heavy casualties, too; one soldier described how only six soldiers from his unit of more than 50 remained uninjured after the first days of fighting.
The Russian losses at Avdiivka are even more numerous than those suffered by the Russian army in battles last year and at Vuhledar in March this year, Ukrainian officials and analysts said.
Those earlier losses of equipment severely restricted Russia's ability to maneuver as it had planned, and the new losses may hamper its operations in the same way again, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington D.C.-based research group.
The city has been a target of Russian guns ever since Russian proxy forces seized it and then lost it to Ukrainian forces in 2014.
"The most we have had is half a day of quiet," said a former lawmaker now serving in the 109th Territorial Defense Brigade near the city, his hometown. "But this assault was the harshest that we have had in the whole war."
He asked to be identified only by his call sign, Deputat, for security reasons, as did all members of the military interviewed for this article.
Over the past nine years Avdiivka has become a bastion of Ukraine's defense in the east. The city stands a few miles from Donetsk, the largest city of the Russian controlled eastern provinces, well within range of its airport and main installations.
Even as Ukrainian troops have lost surrounding territory, they have continued to block Russia's use of the main highway and railroad along the frontline.
That gives Avdiivka strategic military value, since capturing it would push Ukrainian forces back from the threshold of Donetsk and open up the main rail and road routes for Russian forces in the area.
But it carries political value as well. To capture the city after so many years of resistance would be a major coup for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia heading into the winter.
Most of the people in the city fled under the relentless Russian bombardment. Of the prewar population of 36,000, not many more than 1,000 people remain, officials said. "Most of them are pensioners," said Lyuty, the commander of a special forces unit of the Interior Ministry in the city. He was scathing about civilians who refused to leave, saying they put themselves and his men at risk.
Ukrainian reconnaissance teams saw signs of a Russian buildup around Avdiivka in the weeks before the first attack on Oct. 10, said Baloo, commander of the brigade's drone unit. The number amounted to at least three brigades, he said.
"Military vehicles and armor were gathering," he said. "Lots of civilians cars too, which looked like commanders were arriving in the area."
The Russians followed a predictable pattern, Ukrainian soldiers said, opening the battle with heavy artillery and aerial bombardment and then advancing in columns of armored vehicles. They were well prepared, sending demining equipment forward first to clear the way and groups of armored vehicles racing in behind to drop off infantry.
But with fleets of drones in the air, the Ukrainians saw their advance and began targeting the vehicles on the approaches, the commanders said.
"We have an important task, as all drone units do," said Baloo. "We have to locate and dispose of the enemy before they attack."
Over the last year Russian forces have been steadily pushing in a pincer movement to encircle Avdiivka, focusing the main thrust of their recent assaults on closing the last six-mile gap that would cut Ukrainian access to the city.
Russian troops attacked from the northeast to try to cut the main road at the village of Berdichi. From the southwest, other forces pushed up toward the village of Sieverne, which lies on a smaller road into the city.
Russian soldiers broke through to Ukrainian positions in tree lines in the northwest, and began scaling the waste heap that overlooks the coke plant.
The fighting was so intense the first day that the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade began running low on drones and called on the 109th brigade, positioned nearby, for reinforcements.
For a day and half, a drone pilot, call sign Boomer, and his navigator, Grek, joined the fight, zooming in on advancing Russian infantry from a bunker on the edge of the battlefield. A third team member loaded their drones with explosives and launched them into the air.
"We were pushing them back but during the night they were sending in fresh soldiers," Boomer said of the Russian forces. "We killed so many we ran out of stocks." The unit had to call volunteers to send more drones, he said.
On the third day of fighting, Oct. 12, they started to see Russians fleeing. Boomer played a video he had saved on his cellphone of a Russian soldier running away from a bunker. "He understands he will die if he stays there," he said.
After three days of ferocious fighting, there was a lull. The drone team scoured Russian positions for targets. They showed footage of their hits on a reserve tank set back from the frontline and a van hidden in a farmyard that they said was ferrying drones and equipment to Russian forces. Then Russian troops attacked again on Oct. 19.
In the tree lines on the edges of the city, soldiers are fighting hand-to-hand, as the Russians have stormed trenches and the Ukrainians have counterattacked. But much of the battle at Avdiivka is being fought remotely from bunkers and hidden positions.
In a well-constructed underground bunker, set well back from the frontline, commanders of the 1st Strike Battalion of the 59th Mechanized Brigade monitored the fighting on a bank of video screens livestreaming different views of the battlefield.
One screen showed the bodies of Russian soldiers splayed at awkward angles on an empty road. "One is still alive," said Bardak, the battalion's head of reconnaissance. The wounded soldier moved, raising an arm, and then fell back.
"He's dead," a duty officer said.
Even as they recounted successes on the battlefield, Ukrainian soldiers did not play down Russian strengths.
Battalion commanders from the 59th Brigade showed a video of a Russian multiple rocket system carrying thermobaric warheads on its approach through a village during the assault of Oct. 19. The Ukrainians destroyed the weapon, but it could have smashed Ukrainian defenses, and soldiers' morale, if it had not been stopped, Bardak said.
Ukraine could lose Avdiivka under the weight of such Russian firepower, as they did the nearby city of Bakhmut, he said.
"It's possible, if we run out of men and ammunition," he said.
His commander, who uses the call sign Condor, was more upbeat.
The Russians had some small successes but at great cost, he said. "They gain some territory, but a very small area, and they lose the possibility to advance."
"If these tactics they use were successful, we would not be here talking to you now."

Full text: Being with Irwin as he watched and questioned everything around him, I learned that a work of art succeeds when it challenges our perceptions.
Robert Irwin, who died last week in San Diego, at 95, had one of the most restless, inquiring minds of any artist I have ever known. As the story goes, in 1966 he stepped back from one of his very ethereal, so-called abstract "dot paintings" -- composed of small dots of near-complementary colors -- and realized that the visceral, rather than optical phenomenon created by the painting was not the painting itself but rather the real and beautiful shadow cast by the canvas against the wall. He never made another painting. From that point forward he wanted to make works of art without frames, without limits, which he did, continually questioning the very nature of art in almost every visionary work he made.
Irwin coined a term, "conditional art," for his practice. Sometimes nearly invisible, his art was always a function of the circumstances of its being. In graduate school at the University of California, San Diego, I walked every day beneath one of his most simply beautiful works: He had placed large angled planes of blue-violet chain-link fence into the midst of a tall grove of Eucalyptus trees on the campus -- its weight completely disappears, becoming two long diaphanous scrims of pure color lifted high on silver poles, as if lowering a slab of sky into the trees, its violent tint heightening the green glow of their leaves. The work remains to this day, creating an effect of landscape that could never be expressed in a painting.
In 1974 at Pace Gallery in New York Irwin adjusted a single wall of the white rectangular room by stretching a white theater scrim a few inches in front of one wall. Many visitors stepped in and quickly stepped out, assuming the gallery was empty. But those curious enough to enter were treated to the strangest phenomenon: One wall appeared uncannily blurry, challenging assumptions about the space and the perception of a seemingly unfilled room.
One of his most magical works, made around the same time in Italy, at the Villa of Giuseppe Panza di Biumo, consists simply of a rectangle on a wall that at first glance might appear to be a picture of foliage. But if you look closer you understand that you are actually looking through an aperture, a sharp-edged window punctured through the thick walls of the old villa and opening onto a real tree outside. In addition to being a literal breath of fresh air in an art gallery, Irwin's gesture completely reverses the history of painting in which a flat plane is used to feign a three-dimensional reality outside its frame. Here Irwin brings the actual world right to the viewer as a seemingly two-dimensional, and quite sensuous picture, close enough to touch.
The primary medium of Irwin's art is not painting or sculpture, nor walls and trees, but rather our perception, our curiosity, and our desire to make sense of the world around us. By often destabilizing our experience of light and space, his work forces us to construct a personal awareness of the very act of seeing.
Irwin's life and his 60-year career, most of it conducted in Southern California, was kind of a continuous "teaching moment." He was an actual teacher in his early career. Students who attended his classes included the artists Larry Bell, Ed Ruscha, Vija Celmins, Alexis Smith and even Chris Burden, whose thesis consisted of locking himself in a tiny school locker for five days -- which Irwin argued was indeed art. Irwin would claim he had nothing to do with the art his students made. But that's because he didn't teach in any traditional sense of imparting what he knew. He was famous for teaching how to, as he would say, "become your own teacher."
When I directed Dia Art Foundation we asked him to serve as an artist-architect to transform a 1929 factory on the Hudson River into a museum for the 21st century -- now Dia: Beacon -- I vividly remember him walking me to the center of the vast symmetrical open space to view the long rows of windows on the east and west of the building. Rather than tell me what he was thinking in terms of design, he asked me, in a Socratic dialogue, to observe the space closely, and to describe the difference in the color of light between the two sides -- which I did, beginning to understand immediately his approach to the project. In the end, he created two symmetrical doors allowing entry from two subtly different sides of the building. Each visitor to Dia starts with a choice -- their own choice.
While I wasn't yet born when Irwin was teaching in art schools, I can say that over the few decades we have worked together, he has been perhaps my most influential teacher. Being with Irwin as he watched and questioned everything around him, every premise of art and our experience, I learned, among many other things, that a work of art succeeds when it challenges our perceptions to such a degree that it awakens us to reconsider our environment, and invests us with a greater potential to see.
Irwin's own powers of observation were so great that for a time, as a young man, he was able to make a living betting on horse races -- because if you are observant enough, not just of the animals but of every detail of the track and the jockeys and trainers, you might develop winning insights.
One of the coolest things about Irwin was that his worldview renounced the centuries old cliché that to be a great artist you must be filled with angst and unhappiness. He grew up a happy child in the sunshine of Southern California, a lifeguard during summers, famously good on the dance floor, and able to restore a hot rod to absolutely "cherry" condition. And that's not irrelevant to his art. The miracle of perception is not confined to philosophical thinking.
Observing the quintessentially Southern California art of automobile restoration, Irwin once described to his biographer, Lawrence Weschler, his admiration for an average working kid doing the job: "Here was this '29 [car], absolutely dismantled, I mean, completely apart, and the kid was making decisions about the frame, whether or not he was going to cad plate certain bolts...or leave them raw... But, I mean, real aesthetic decisions ... Here was a 15-year old kid who wouldn't know art from schmart, but you couldn't talk about a more real aesthetic activity than what he was doing, how he was carefully weighing: what was the attitude of this whole thing? What exactly? How should it look? What was the relationship in terms of its machinery, its social bearing, everything?"
While he may have received some of the highest honors in the field of art, the MacArthur "genius" grant among them, Irwin was always grounded in the pleasures of the everyday. As long as I knew him, and for much of the nine and a half decades he lived, this deeply philosophical and accomplished man was almost always seen in faded blue jeans, sneakers and a T-shirt, a ball cap on his head and a tattered bomber jacket on his shoulders, with a fountain Coca Cola -- his beloved elixir -- in hand.
Irwin's goal as an artist wasn't to make objects, but rather to change the way we see. As he told his biographer: "If you asked me the sum total -- what is your ambition? Basically it's just to make you a little more aware than the day before of how beautiful the world is."

Full text: 1. False Parents know all too well that certain sugar-infused activities, like gorging on candy on Halloween night, can bring out a kid's wild side. But the "sugar high" myth has been debunked; there is no evidence that sugar can influence a child's behavior or cognitive function, or make a child hyperactive.
2. D Though the studies are far from conclusive, researchers have found that those who eat cocoa-based products -- like chocolate, and especially dark chocolate -- tend to enjoy several health benefits, including lowered blood pressure and reduced risk of certain cardiovascular diseases, like stroke and heart attack.
A 1.5-ounce dark chocolate bar can also contain more than 20 milligrams of caffeine. A Halloween chocolate binge probably will not put you over the Food and Drug Administration's recommended daily caffeine limit of 400 milligrams, it could be enough to interfere with your sleep -- depending on how sensitive you are to caffeine, and how much of it you consume and when.
3. A Based on sales information compiled by CandyStore.com, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were the most-purchased Halloween candy from 2007 to 2022. M&M's came in second place, Starburst came in sixth and Snickers came in 10th.
4. C Earlier this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California signed a law that would ban four chemicals, including Red dye No. 3, from foods beginning in 2027. The coloring is used in several popular Halloween candies, including candy corn and certain colors and flavors of Pez and Peeps.
The F.D.A. banned the dye from cosmetics in 1990 after animal studies showed that it could cause cancer in high doses, but the agency still allows its use in food. The dye is banned in the European Union, except when used as a coloring for cocktail and candied cherries.
5. D Butterfinger BB's candy -- a round, bite-size version of the classic Butterfinger bar -- debuted in 1992, but was discontinued in 2006 because of low sales, according to a tweet from Butterfinger in 2014. Pop Rocks, Necco Wafers and Bit-O-Honey are all still available.
6. B Any candy that is sticky, gooey or chewy can adhere to your teeth or wedge into its crevices, feeding the cavity-causing bacteria that live inside your mouth. The acids in sour candy can also wear away at the protective enamel of your teeth, increasing the risk of tooth decay. Because chocolate is not as sticky as these other types of candies, it is a better choice for your oral health, according to the American Dental Association -- especially if you choose dark chocolate, they say, because it tends to have less cavity-causing sugar than milk chocolate.
7. D A trick-or-treat-size Kit Kat contains about eight grams of sugar. A mini box of Nerds, a Tootsie Pop and a small packet of candy corn each contain about 11 grams of sugar.
8. B One can of Coke contains 39 grams (or about 10 teaspoons) of sugar -- about the same amount as in 50 Skittles. The American Heart Association recommends that women consume no more than 24 grams of sugar a day, and men no more than 36 grams a day.
9. C Researchers have found that when children are given a sugary drink, they need a higher sugar concentration than adults do to detect a sweet taste. They have also discovered that the cells in the tongue that sense sweet, salty, bitter, sour and umami tastes are spaced out across the tongue; some people are genetically more predisposed to liking sweets than others; and children tend to prefer the taste of sour candies more than adults do.
10. False People in the United States consume a lot of candy on Halloween. But by far, soda and other sweetened drinks account for the majority of added sugar in our diets.
According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, for instance, 24 percent of the added sugars people in the United States consume each day come from sugar-sweetened beverages. Another 19 percent come from desserts and sweet snacks; 11 percent from coffee and tea; 9 percent from candy; and 7 percent from breakfast cereals and bars.

THE OUTSKIRTS OF AVDIIVKA, UKRAINE — The tall chimneys of the Avdiivka Coke Plant stand out against the skyline. Beside it a sprawling slag heap juts into the sky, offering a high point overlooking the city of Avdiivka and surrounding villages.
The two landmarks have been the focus of furious fighting since Oct. 10 as thousands of Russian troops began a major new offensive in eastern Ukraine to seize Avdiivka, a long-coveted prize that would extend Russia’s control of the coal mining region of the Donbas.
Yet within days this battle for Avdiivka was shaping up to be perhaps the costliest of the war for Russia. Ukrainian artillery destroyed Russian armored columns on the approaches to the city, and drones armed with explosives struck down infantry as they dismounted from vehicles and advanced on foot, according to Ukrainian soldiers and commanders, Russian military bloggers and independent military analysts.
Waves of Russian soldiers scaled the industrial waste heap to gain its heights. Each time they were shredded by Ukrainian artillery.
Nearly three weeks into the battle, the Russian army has failed to make the swift breakthrough it wanted. It has lost hundreds of men and more than 100 armored vehicles and tanks, the Institute for the Study of War reported, and twice that amount by Ukrainian accounts. In the main direction of the attacks, it has advanced barely a mile, and in other places only a few hundred yards.
As both sides have found in nearly two years of heavy artillery battles, a mechanized assault against a strong defensive line is always a brutal experience.
The Ukrainians are taking heavy casualties, too; one soldier described how only six soldiers from his unit of more than 50 remained uninjured after the first days of fighting.
The Russian losses at Avdiivka are even more numerous than those suffered by the Russian army in battles last year and at Vuhledar in March this year, Ukrainian officials and analysts said.
Those earlier losses of equipment severely restricted Russia’s ability to maneuver as it had planned, and the new losses may hamper its operations in the same way again, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington, D.C.-based research group.
The city has been a target of Russian guns ever since Russian proxy forces seized it and then lost it to Ukrainian forces in 2014.
“The most we have had is half a day of quiet,” said a former lawmaker now serving in the 109th Territorial Defense Brigade near the city, his hometown. “But this assault was the harshest that we have had in the whole war.”
He asked to be identified only by his call sign, Deputat, for security reasons, as did all members of the military interviewed for this article.
Over the past nine years Avdiivka has become a bastion of Ukraine’s defense in the east. The city stands a few miles from Donetsk, the largest city of the Russian controlled eastern provinces, well within range of its airport and main installations.
Even as Ukrainian troops have lost surrounding territory, they have continued to block Russia’s use of the main highway and railroad along the front line.
That gives Avdiivka strategic military value, since capturing it would push Ukrainian forces back from the threshold of Donetsk and open up the main rail and road routes for Russian forces in the area.
But it carries political value as well. To capture the city after so many years of resistance would be a major coup for President Vladimir Putin of Russia heading into the winter.
Most of the people in the city fled under the relentless Russian bombardment. Of the prewar population of 36,000, not many more than 1,000 people remain, officials said. “Most of them are pensioners,” said Lyuty, the commander of a special forces unit of the Interior Ministry in the city. He was scathing about civilians who refused to leave, saying they put themselves and his men at risk.
Ukrainian reconnaissance teams saw signs of a Russian buildup around Avdiivka in the weeks before the first attack on Oct. 10, said Baloo, commander of the brigade’s drone unit. The number amounted to at least three brigades, he said.
“Military vehicles and armor were gathering,” he said. “Lots of civilians cars too, which looked like commanders were arriving in the area.”
The Russians followed a predictable pattern, Ukrainian soldiers said, opening the battle with heavy artillery and aerial bombardment and then advancing in columns of armored vehicles. They were well prepared, sending demining equipment forward first to clear the way and groups of armored vehicles racing in behind to drop off infantry.
But with fleets of drones in the air, the Ukrainians saw their advance and began targeting the vehicles on the approaches, the commanders said.
“We have an important task, as all drone units do,” said Baloo. “We have to locate and dispose of the enemy before they attack.”
Over the last year Russian forces have been steadily pushing in a pincer movement to encircle Avdiivka, focusing the main thrust of their recent assaults on closing the last 6-mile gap that would cut Ukrainian access to the city.
Russian troops attacked from the northeast to try to cut the main road at the village of Berdichi. From the southwest, other forces pushed up toward the village of Sieverne, which lies on a smaller road into the city.
Russian soldiers broke through to Ukrainian positions in tree lines in the northwest, and began scaling the waste heap that overlooks the coke plant.
The fighting was so intense the first day that the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade began running low on drones and called on the 109th brigade, positioned nearby, for reinforcements.
For a day and half, a drone pilot, call sign Boomer, and his navigator, Grek, joined the fight, zooming in on advancing Russian infantry from a bunker on the edge of the battlefield. A third team member loaded their drones with explosives and launched them into the air.
“We were pushing them back but during the night they were sending in fresh soldiers,” Boomer said of the Russian forces. “We killed so many we ran out of stocks.” The unit had to call volunteers to send more drones, he said.
On the third day of fighting, Oct. 12, they started to see Russians fleeing. Boomer played a video he had saved on his cellphone of a Russian soldier running away from a bunker. “He understands he will die if he stays there,” he said.
After three days of ferocious fighting, there was a lull. The drone team scoured Russian positions for targets. They showed footage of their hits on a reserve tank set back from the front line and a van hidden in a farmyard that they said was ferrying drones and equipment to Russian forces. Then Russian troops attacked again Oct. 19.
In the tree lines on the edges of the city, soldiers are fighting hand-to-hand, as the Russians have stormed trenches and the Ukrainians have counterattacked. But much of the battle at Avdiivka is being fought remotely from bunkers and hidden positions.
In a well-constructed underground bunker, set well back from the front line, commanders of the 1st Strike Battalion of the 59th Mechanized Brigade monitored the fighting on a bank of video screens livestreaming different views of the battlefield.
One screen showed the bodies of Russian soldiers splayed at awkward angles on an empty road. “One is still alive,” said Bardak, the battalion’s head of reconnaissance. The wounded soldier moved, raising an arm, and then fell back.
“He’s dead,” a duty officer said.
Even as they recounted successes on the battlefield, Ukrainian soldiers did not play down Russian strengths.
Battalion commanders from the 59th Brigade showed a video of a Russian multiple rocket system carrying thermobaric warheads on its approach through a village during the assault of Oct. 19. The Ukrainians destroyed the weapon, but it could have smashed Ukrainian defenses, and soldiers’ morale, if it had not been stopped, Bardak said.
Ukraine could lose Avdiivka under the weight of such Russian firepower, as they did the nearby city of Bakhmut, he said.
“It’s possible, if we run out of men and ammunition,” he said.
His commander, who uses the call sign Condor, was more upbeat.
The Russians had some small successes but at great cost, he said. “They gain some territory, but a very small area, and they lose the possibility to advance.”
“If these tactics they use were successful, we would not be here talking to you now.”

Full text: I thought pantyhose were dead, but now it seems as if they are being treated as the equivalent of actual pants. Are we supposed to believe the pantyhose-instead-of-pants look I see on social media is going to be a trend? And I thought leggings were bad.
Susan, Vancouver, B.C. It's true: Pantyhose (one of the most unappealing names for a garment ever invented) have been on the rise for a few seasons now, after disappearing almost entirely from many wardrobes as women not in the British royal family were freed from some of the more egregious dress code strictures of the past century.
Invented in 1959 by Allen Gant Sr., who called them "panti-legs," pantyhose may have revolutionized foundation garments by doing away with the girdle, garter belt and stockings, but by the millennium, being able to say no to pulling on a pair of flesh-sucking sheer tights was a sign of liberation. The fashion world became so attached to the End of Pantyhose that editors famously went to shows in February with bare legs and high heels, snow be damned.
Then, in September 2022, Matthieu Blazy of Bottega Veneta sent a navy crew neck down his runway paired with only dark hose and heels. A few months later, Miuccia Prada largely tossed pants and skirts out the window in her Miu Miu show, subversively matching her librarian cardigans and beatnik polo necks with sheer hose. A vibe was born. Or reborn.
Of course, Mrs. Prada did not invent the no-pants look -- that was popularized by Edie Sedgwick back when she was Andy Warhol's It girl, prancing around the Factory in black tights and a boat-neck tee. That may have been the reference when Emma Corrin (an It person of the moment) closed the Miu Miu fall show in a camel turtleneck, gold sparkly bikini bottoms and sheer brown hose.
Little wonder that earlier this month the audience at the spring 2024 Miu Miu show was chockablock with pants-less influencers, all vying for the title of It girl. Or that the style has been picked up by such figures as Kendall Jenner, who modeled the Bottega look in real life, and Rihanna, who went pantsless at ASAP Rocky's birthday dinner, wearing a ruffled chiffon top, bomber jacket and glossy tights.
Most people who live in the real world will never forgo their pants in favor of tights. But given that extreme runway fashion has a way of trickling down and becoming digestible for everyday, and given the talent Miuccia Prada has for making today what everyone wears tomorrow, odds are that the no-pants-but-pantyhose look may lead to a pantyhose renaissance.
Indeed, during the last round of fall 2023 shows, Virginie Viard was pairing white lace tights with almost every look on her Chanel runway. And Boss, Dolce & Gabbana, LaQuan Smith and Saint Laurent all featured sheer black pantyhose with pencil skirts and cocktail frocks.
All of which is good news for those who appreciate the smoothing, buffing effect that sheer pantyhose has on legs, not to mention the bit of added warmth when the temperature falls. Personally, I think they would be more popular if someone came up with a better name.

Full text: EARNINGS
Coke Raises Outlook
After Strong 3rd Quarter
Coca-Cola raised its full-year revenue forecast Tuesday after a stronger-than-expected third quarter.
The Atlanta-based company said it now expected its organic revenue will be up 10 percent to 11 percent for the year, up from the 8 percent to 9 percent guidance Coke announced at the end of the second quarter. Coke expects earnings to grow 13 percent to 14 percent, up from a previous forecast of 9 percent to 11 percent.
In North America, case volumes were flat. Coke said growth in sparkling drinks, juices and dairy, including the its Fairlife and Minute Maid brands, was offset by declines in categories like water and sports drinks.
The company continued to raise prices to offset higher ingredient costs, but at a more moderate pace. Prices rose 9 percent in the most recent quarter compared with double-digit increases in five previous quarters.

EARNINGS
Cost Cuts and Price Hikes
Send 3M Forecast Higher
3M raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast and reported upbeat quarterly earnings on Tuesday, as the diversified manufacturer was able to offset slow demand with price increases and cost savings.
3M raised prices to offset high raw material and labor costs, and undertook a work force reduction amid waning demand for consumer electronics.
3M on Tuesday also flagged a soft back-to-school season and a continued impact from rising interest rates.
3M now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $ 8.95 to $ 9.15 per share, versus prior forecast of $ 8.60 to $ 9.10.
The company's adjusted profit for the third quarter came in at $ 2.68 per share, above analysts' estimates of $ 2.34. Adjusted revenue of $ 8.02 billion also beat Street estimates of $ 7.98 billion. REUTERS
COMPANIES
Nikola Gets $ 165 Million
In Case Against Founder
Nikola Corp. has been awarded $ 165 million in an arbitration proceeding with its founder and former executive chairman, according to a regulatory filing.
The electric and hydrogen-powered heavy truck maker said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it sought reimbursement from Trevor Milton for costs and damages related to actions that were part of government and regulatory investigations, including a December 2021 S.E.C. settlement.
Mr. Milton, who resigned from Nikola in 2020, was found guilty on three of four counts of securities and wire fraud in October 2022.
Nikola's stock price plunged in 2020 and investors suffered heavy losses as reports questioned Mr. Milton's claims that the company had already produced zero-emission 18-wheel trucks.
The company paid $ 125 million in 2021 to settle a civil case against it by the S.E.C. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Market Rallies as Upbeat Earnings and Outlook Cheer Investors: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street ended higher on Tuesday as a spate of solid corporate earnings and upbeat forecasts stoked investor risk appetite and sparked a broad rally.
All three major United States stock indexes advanced, with interest rate-sensitive megacaps providing much of the upside lift as benchmark Treasury yields held steady, comfortably below their recent spike to 5 percent.
Third-quarter earnings season has shifted into high gear, and this week nearly a third of the companies in the S&P 500 are expected to post results.
"The earnings season is only now just getting into full swing with a third of the companies reporting this week," said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT in Atlanta. "Prior to yesterday and today, the earnings reports were a bit on the disappointing side, and so this was the first couple of days we've had some more upbeat and better earnings."
Indeed, of the 118 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, 81 percent have beaten analysts' expectations, according to LSEG.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.62 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.73 percent and the Nasdaq composite added 0.93 percent.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, utilities enjoyed the largest gain, while energy was the sole loser, weighed down by softening crude prices.
Verizon surged 9.3 percent after raising its annual free cash flow forecast, while General Electric rose 6.5 percent after the conglomerate lifted its full-year profit forecast.
Coca-Cola lifted its annual sales outlook, sending its stock up 2.9 percent, while 3M rose 5.3 percent on the heels of its upbeat quarterly report.
Shares of the aerospace firm RTX jumped 7.2 percent after the company's results topped expectations.
On the economics front, business activity in the United States has ticked higher this month, according to S&P Global's advance "flash" purchasing managers' indexes.
Calling the PMI a "goldilocks" report, Mr. Martin said it was "generally a good report" with prices moderating and "OK" employment.
On Thursday, the Commerce Department is set to release its first take on third quarter gross domestic product, which is seen showing a robust acceleration to 4.3 percent from 2.1 percent in the second quarter.
On Friday, the Commerce Department is expected to follow with its closely watched Personal Consumption Expenditure report, which analysts expect will provide further evidence that inflation is slowly cooling down toward the Federal Reserve's average annual 2 percent target rate.
"The question is, can the Fed thread the needle -- can they get inflation to moderate to an acceptable level before things deteriorate significantly for the U.S. consumer?" said Bill Merz, head of Capital Market Research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.
If that happens, Mr. Merz added, the odds increase that the U.S. economy will avoid a recession.
Shares of Microsoft posted after-hours gains after beating quarterly revenue estimates, while Alphabet lost ground after the bell, following its revenue beat.

When Sports Took a Turn Into Mass Entertainment: [Review]

Full text: Michael MacCambridge's "The Big Time" rewinds to the '70s, when showy personalities and compelling rivalries turned sports into mass entertainment.
THE BIG TIME: How the 1970s Transformed Sports in America, by Michael MacCambridge
It's silly, and arbitrary -- and increasingly antique -- to organize American history by decades. But also oddly satisfying, like sorting a junk drawer.
The 1970s, now in or approaching their paunchy and contemplative 50s, were particularly overstuffed with junk: war, stagflation, pet rocks. Writers, including David Frum and Bruce J. Schulman, have tried to tackle the whole shebang. In his new book, "The Big Time," Michael MacCambridge sticks prudently, and often illuminatingly, to sports, which he argues became the lucrative juggernaut we know today in that polyester period.
The book is nonetheless a sprawl, covering in overlapping segments tennis, football, baseball, basketball, boxing, golf, hockey and lesser-known competitions showcased in the Olympics. "He could really come out of this hot," the TV producer Roone Arledge predicted of the decathlete then known as Bruce Jenner at Montreal in 1976. "He's charismatic. I think he could be another Dorothy Hamill."
"The Big Time" crackles with such personalities, and induces longing for a time when sporting events were less scripted, scrutinized and corporatized. Men across the board were peacocks, bustling with ego: Joe Namath and his mink coat; John Fuqua and the goldfish you could see swimming inside his translucent heels; Jack Nicklaus and his weight loss; Jimmy Connors and his crotch grabs; Reggie Jackson and his candy bar. ("When you unwrap a Reggie! Bar," the pitcher Catfish Hunter joked, "it tells you how good it is.")
The era's rampant racism and sexism are hardly news, but MacCambridge's well-cut highlight reels compel nonetheless. Media outlets, including this one, were slow to accept Muhammad Ali's renunciation of his "slave name," Cassius Clay. The Atlanta Braves star Hank Aaron got piles of hate mail as he closed in on Babe Ruth's record of 714 homers. Black athletes struggled to get endorsements -- "I haven't done a dog food commercial," said the wide receiver Otis Taylor in 1971, "and that's pretty sorry for a guy who'd be so happy to do one he'd eat the dog food."
The difference in funding for men's and women's teams at the University of Texas at Austin when the staunch Title IX defender Donna Lopiano began there as director of women's athletics was simply staggering ( $ 2.4 million and $ 128,000, respectively). Roberta Gibb was told by Boston Marathon organizers that "women are physiologically incapable of running 26.2 miles."
A lot of these anecdotes make you want to bash your head against the wall, like a character in a Charles Schulz comic strip ("Aaugh!"). How gratifying, and how '70s, to be reminded that the cartoonist himself championed equality in sports, putting female characters on the baseball field, notably Peppermint Patty, and using Snoopy in the strip to call attention to the despicable prejudice Aaron faced.
Schulz was among the 45 million Americans who in 1973 watched Billie Jean King defeat Bobby Riggs, a onetime Wimbledon champion and "proud troglodyte on gender issues," in the gaudy but deeply consequential Battle of the Sexes match. (The 2017 movie version failed to capture the excitement of its source material, cast in yesteryear's snappy copy as the Libber vs. the Lobber. )
This is one of the more famous turning points MacCambridge revisits, building a case for the beginning of sports as mass entertainment and big business. The halftime slam-dunk contest won by Julius Erving in the middle of the decade, though seen by few, is another. The rise of color television, only conclusive in 1972, made costumes of uniforms. The Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders entered their white-spandex hot pants era, the team they buoyed "as identifiable a national 'brand' as McDonald's or Coca-Cola."
MacCambridge, a seasoned reporter who among other books, some encyclopedic, wrote a history of Sports Illustrated magazine, wants to drive home to readers the former importance of print journalism -- how one used to have to wait till the next day's paper for results. He warmly invokes technological ephemera like portable cassette recorders tinnily playing the national anthem, and the Sports Phone service: "a kind of life line for obsessives," he writes, along with, of course, gamblers. At times -- Bud Collins! Dick Button! Frank Gifford! -- the book is like a family reunion of jolly TV uncles.
Though MacCambridge's prose perhaps inevitably sometimes swims in stats and abbreviations -- in a litigious period, the joke was the N.B.A. stood for Nothing but Attorneys -- he has a knack for the graceful phrase. Some I scribbled down: "Fourth-drink recklessness." "Oleaginous recruiters." "Amiable, beige Midwestern voices." (To describe anyone but Howard Cosell.) "A corona of hirsute flamboyance." All summon this time as quickly as Ron Burgundy's sports jacket.
"The Big Time" is probably not for the obsessive, who will already know much of what MacCambridge describes, but more for the curious generalist who wants to speed-skate down memory lane to the theme music from "Wide World of Sports." Inevitably there are chips in the ice. Criminally, we get no back story on the "agony of defeat" ski jumper Vinko Bogataj. In that case, thank heavens for YouTube.

Look Who's on the Scent: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: Corporations are now mimicking fashion designers and hiring development firms to create a signature scent that clients won't forget.
Dora Baghriche grew up in Algiers, where the scents of jasmine, pine, orange blossom and Mediterranean salt spray swirled around her, wafting into her memory.
"Both of my grandmothers were chefs so I grew up in the kitchens and smelling the fields of flowers around our house," she said from her home in Paris. Ms. Baghriche, a senior perfumer at the fragrance development company Firmenich, has since created scents for major fashion houses like Yves Saint Laurent and Estée Lauder.
But one of the most unusual challenges of her career came when an unexpected brand asked her to design a fragrance for new spaces they were building called "experience centers."
The brand was Mastercard, befuddling Ms. Baghriche, 43. "When Mastercard told me what they wanted to do, my first question was, 'Why?"' she said.
The mission behind the experience centers is to give the credit card giant a physical footprint for its brand and show off its newest technology. This was unexplored territory for Mastercard, and the company's marketing team wanted to create a space that engaged all of a customer's senses.
Companies using bespoke scents in their spaces are nothing new. Hotels that want to exude a sense of luxurious relaxation have been designing their own candles for decades, and no one who stepped into an Abercrombie & Fitch store in the 2000s will ever forget the olfactory sting of the brand's musky cologne that fogged their retail stores.
But smell is increasingly becoming part of the brand strategy for companies in unexpected industries, as brands jostle for precious slivers of market share and especially as workers and clients begin to trickle back into office spaces. So the unlikeliest of companies are joining the scent trend.
"Traditionally, marketers have focused on creating mostly a visual identity for their brands. A logo, a design style, the kind of thing that makes it easy to say 'that's Apple' or 'that's Mastercard.' But one key thing that wasn't appreciated is that we're generally blessed with five senses," said Raja Rajamannar, chief marketing officer at Mastercard.
Mr. Rajamannar, 61, spearheaded the "multisensory brand identity" effort for the credit card company, and commissioned Ms. Baghriche and Firmenich to create a dual set of complementary fragrances inspired by the interlocking red and orange circles from Mastercard's logo and the abstract prompts "passion" and "optimism."
Since you can't smell a TV or internet ad -- they're working on that -- fragrance hasn't been much of a consideration for marketing departments in industries like insurance and financial services. But physical spaces are now doubling as unorthodox, semi-permanent marketing efforts. Luxury car brands like Genesis operate white-tablecloth restaurants with classically-trained chefs, and the travel search platform Kayak runs a hotel in Miami.
"We have customers that often ask about the scent and whether it's for sale," said Rachel Espersen, executive director of brand experience at Genesis House and Studios, a multipurpose space in the Meatpacking district operated by the luxury carmaker. The venue contains a restaurant, a library and a showroom, and the company designed three scents that are diffused in different spaces. "In our studio and showcase spaces, we either use a scent called 'Down to Earth' or 'Coming Home,' depending on the space's specific design. The first floor showroom and cellar stage at Genesis House uses the 'Down to Earth' scent," she said in an email.
Credit card companies have been especially active in this new arena: Mastercard has its "experience centers" in cities like Dubai, Mexico City, and New York. American Express has created a Centurion members club in a high-rise in New York, and has exclusive airport lounges. Automakers are extending their brand names to condominiums, especially in Miami.
How a place smells is now something that companies need to think about in the same way they pick out chairs or choose wallpaper.
They also need to budget for them. "A custom scent could be anywhere from $ 5,000 to $ 65,000, and we live on the higher end of that number," said Dawn Goldworm, the co-founder of 12.29, a scent branding company that has worked with several large banks and car companies, including Cadillac.
Developing a bespoke scent is only the beginning as well, as companies have to pay for the creation of fragrance oil and a dedicated dispersal system that can sometimes be installed in a space's HVAC system. "It can cost anywhere from $ 100 every month to thousands every month. You need the machinery, you need someone to install it, you need someone to service it, and you need the supply of fragrance oil on a regular basis," Ms. Goldworm, 44, said.
Perfumers like Ms. Baghriche are typically tasked with creating scents that live on skin, where biochemical reactions can alter how a fragrance smells on different people. If delicate changes like a person's skin pH level can change the iconic whiff of, say, Chanel No. 5 perfume, how do you create a stable scent for millions of square feet of commercial space?
Part of the answer is creating a fragrance that doesn't make anyone run for the exits. "Universality was a really important factor. We didn't want to design anything that would be shocking to a specific culture," Ms. Baghriche said.
Some smells -- fresh citrus, floral notes -- hold a sweeping appeal, and Ms. Baghriche considered those scents when she was developing Mastercard's scent. The twin scents she created -- "Priceless Passion" and "Priceless Optimism" -- have murmurs of rose, sweet grass and orange.
Smell and memory speak fluently to one another. Research has shown our olfactory senses develop more quickly than sight, and that the creation of memories associated with smell follows a more direct path than sound.
In a way, Ms. Baghriche's job is to use the echoes of jasmine, orange blossom, and the Mediterranean salt spray from her own life to impress new memories on those who encounter her work. "Our house was in a pine forest and we lived just above the sea," she said. "I grew up with all those Mediterranean smells. It was a really romantic childhood."

Full text: Mario Schifano
Through Jan. 8. Magazzino Italian Art, 2700 Route 9, Cold Spring, N.Y.; 845-666-7202, magazzino.art.
Pop Art finally arrived in 1962, when Andy Warhol and 28 playful upstarts, displaying their wares in "New Realists" at the Sidney Janis Gallery, drove Mark Rothko, the master of sober, hovering shapes of color, to leave the gallerist in a pique.
One New Realist must have needled with special force: the proto-punk Mario Schifano. For across the 80 works in his big new exhibition, "Mario Schifano: the Rise of the '60s," it becomes obvious that this Italian interpreter of Coca-Cola (a logo he loves to quote) understood the goals of Abstract Expressionism even while he mocked them.
As with Rothko, his muse was the square -- just the wrong kind. In pencil Schifano drafts rounded squares inside crisp-cornered ones, replicating the era's tube televisions. Into them he mortars sloppy brushloads of enamel paint, the pigment of outdoor signage. In "Elemento per Paesaggio" (1962), squares stack up helter-skelter, recalling TVs in a pawnshop window.
Elsewhere, color lampoons consumer choice. In two untitled works from 1961, one square wears a yellow-and-cobalt reminiscent of the Spam tin, while the other is done in the signature cream-and-crimson of Coke. Across each foreground, Schifano draws a cartoon rope seat and bucket, vacant, as if the billboard painter has just taken lunch.
Schifano knew that studio painting had, through reproduction, joined mass media. Where Rothko's generation yearned for pure, unmediated color, Schifano submits to modernity's mediator: the screen. It's fitting that in the stillness of the Magazzino's Brutalist pavilion, no titles or dates clutter the exhibition. For those, you must download the app. WALKER MIMMS
Carlos Villa and Leo Valledor
Through Nov. 4. Silverlens, 505 West 24th Street, Manhattan. 646-449-9400; silverlensgalleries.com.
Carlos Villa (1936-2013) and Leo Valledor (1936-1989) grew up together in San Francisco, the children of Filipino immigrants. Both became artists. Both moved to New York, though Villa went back home after a few years to teach at San Francisco Art Institute. But Valledor made hard-edge nonfigurative painting, while Villa, after starting in a similar vein, found his artistic voice with feathers, body prints and performance.
Showing together for the very first time, according to Silverlens Gallery, in "Carlos Villa & Leo Valledor: Remains of Surface," the artists enrich each other immeasurably. The intellectual quality of Valledor's work, the sense that every aesthetic decision is a kind of serenely bloodless chess move, highlights the artifice and deliberation in Villa's approach. At the same time, Villa's energy and self-expression expose the passion and personality implicit in Valledor, making his saturated colors sparkle and pop.
Valledor's "We Shall Overcome," from 1983, is a group of four shaped canvases marked with simple stripes and diagonals of red, gold, black and white. Bracketed by face prints, they glow like neon. A roughly contemporary unstretched canvas by Villa, meanwhile, marked with dozens of black and gray faces interspersed with fabric scraps and chicken bones, is a powerful demand that the artist's identity, as he conceives of it, be given space in the canon. But it's also as carefully composed and balanced a composition as his friend's. WILL HEINRICH
Wade Guyton
Through Oct. 28. Matthew Marks, 523 West 24th Street, Manhattan; 212-243-0200, matthewmarks.com.
A handful of current painting shows in New York involve canvases stuck on idiosyncratic supports, as if the paintings themselves aren't enough. Wade Guyton has the most elaborate (and least gimmicky) armature of all: free-standing metal scaffolding that augments the walls to display 35 untitled, identically sized paintings (2020--23). Wandering through the aisles at Matthew Marks feels like shopping in museum storage. Figuratively speaking, though, the ranks of pipes are a dry joke about Guyton's perennial, self-reflexive subject: the galleries, machines and discourses underpinning heady conceptual work like his.
The paintings seem pitched to different tastes. Into abstract art? Consider a smeary, neon canvas resembling a glitchy Gerhard Richter squeegee painting. A Guyton die-hard? There are variations on the large black sans-serif X he's used since the 2000s. Politically inclined? Another group reproduces New York Times articles describing violent clashes -- from Russia attacking Ukraine to the NYPD kettling protesters.
The works aren't paintings, actually, but Epson inkjet prints on linen, which Guyton folds in half, runs through the machine twice, then unfolds and stretches. They winkingly declare their status as products of a honed, repeatable process. Several show romantically worn studio rooms or twisted modernist furniture; one depicts a black, hot pink and orange abstraction coming off the press. In the abstract works, the expressivity or uniqueness that Abstract Expressionism continues to evoke is undermined by certain passages that repeat across the fold. But the folds are also jarring, imperfect flashes of chaos -- each artwork is singular after all. TRAVIS DIEHL
Ozioma Onuzulike
Through Oct. 29. Marc Straus Gallery, 299 Grand Street, Manhattan; 212-510-7646, marcstraus.com.
In his U.S. debut solo exhibition, the Nigerian ceramic artist Ozioma Onuzulike offers an elegant invitation to think about climate change. His assemblage "Of Harvest and Mixed Feelings" (2023) appears to consist of stacked yams mounted with wire to vertical boards hung from the wall, creating eight columns with nearly 20 of the tubers stacked on each. The yams are actually made of fired earthenware and stoneware clays. Their arrangement brings to mind both the rows of a farmer's field as well as minimalist paintings like Agnes Martin's masterwork "Friendship" (1963), at MoMA, with its grid of gold leaf and oil paint rectangles. But here Onuzulike's grid is complicated by a parabola of singed darkness rising from the bottom of his wall-mounted construction like a wave from left to right.
Yams are an essential crop of Nigeria and many other African nations of the so-called yam belt. Climate change has disrupted the growing season, with crop yields predicted to further decline, increasing regional food insecurity -- a complex situation Onuzulike distills in a single emblematic work.
Most of the seven works on display use clay beads and wire to make objects that are both sculpture and textile, recalling the flattened bottle-cap constructions of the Ghanaian artist El Anatsui. In "Lagbaja's Extra-Large Danshiki" (2023), nearly 16,000 beads in the shape of palm kernels -- fired with ash and recycled glass glazes in a variety of colors and textures -- combine to replicate the familiar Yoruba garment at a monumental scale of more than 10 feet square.

Hunting for the Best Duck in the City: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: A roundup of restaurants where the bird is the word, from the elaborate crown roast at Francie to the crunchy fried wings at Upland.
Hi, I'm Pete Wells, restaurant critic for the Times and unarmed duck hunter.
Each October, I get hungry for duck. There's no good explanation for my timing. In some parts of the country, fall is when you pull on waders, whistle for the retrievers and crouch in a marsh waiting for mallards and teals to take wing. But we don't usually shoot birds in New York. When I want to bag a duck, I go to a restaurant, where they're rarely laced with buckshot and never out of season.
When the first chilly night of October rolls in, it's the breast of the duck I crave. The skin that I picture is brown and somewhat crunchy. The meat, like a steak, should be dry-aged and cooked to a color somewhere between rosé-pink and bloody.
Roast duck as spectacle
Duck breast, once a fairly straightforward dish, has been a showpiece for chefs since the mid-2000s, when Daniel Humm's duck glazed with honey and lavender waddled on to the menu at Eleven Madison Park. If there were a trophy for the most spectacular version in town, Chris Cipollone, the chef at Francie, in Williamsburg, would walk away with it. A whole roasted breast (Francie calls it a crown roast) is carried to the table in a wreath of leaves, flowers and herbs that makes it look like a pagan queen. Then it is sliced and returned without its crown but with fruits, vegetables and a scene-stealing soppressata jam.
There is less song and dance when the "BBQ Duck" appears at the Noortwyck, in Greenwich Village. This is also a whole, dry-aged Rohan duck breast, but while Mr. Cipollone brushes the skin with honey, Andy Quinn here rubs it with molasses and spices. It's a stripped-down barbecue sauce, and the kitchen follows through on the cookout theme by grilling the breast over charcoal.
Torrisi, on Mulberry Street, matches its excellent dry-aged roasted breast with pungent mulberry mostarda. The roasted breast in green-peppercorn sauce at Libertine is part one of a two-part dish; the second half is a gratin of duck confit parmentier, shredded leg meat under a golden crust of broiled puréed potatoes.
The bird, the whole bird and nothing but the bird
With so many aged and rendered duck breasts around town, it's easy to forget how good the rest of the bird can be. I went to Frenchette the other night, hoping for a reunion with its duck frites -- only to find that the dish has been put on hiatus. In its place was a rich and flavorful confit duck leg on top of a ragout of white beans and fresh pole beans, which French cooks and others will recognize as a very high-level cassoulet hack.
Whole birds are required for Beijing duck, the most skillful local version of which can be found these days at Juqi, in Flushing. And Cosme, north of Union Square, slowly roasts entire ducks with evaporated milk, oranges, chiles and Mexican Coke, among other things; the meat is shredded and reassembled as duck carnitas.
But what about those of us who like the odds and ends and organs? Well, we can zip out to Falansai, in Bushwick, to eat confit duck necks with our hands. We can forge onward to Elmhurst, where liver and bits of fried skin punctuate the minced duck breast in Zaab Zaab's magnificent larb ped Udon. In Manhattan, Justin Smillie's fried duck wings are still on the menu at Upland, served with a dab of yuzu kosho to burn through the richness. And of course, virtually all the foie gras in New York is made from duck livers.
Then again, as Chico Marx asked, why a duck? Why-a not a fish? If waterfowl aren't your thing, maybe you should try "Bombay duck" at Dhamaka, on the Lower East Side. It's a fish, an Indian lizardfish to be precise, frozen and shipped around the globe to Dhamaka. There, it's fried in a shell of semolina and served with cilantro chutney. Unlike the aquatic waterfowl, Bombay duck is meant to be eaten whole, bones and all.
What I'm reading
I suspected there would be a lot to love in Dwight Garner's Grub Street Diet. Dwight has been a book critic at The Times for years, and I had some inkling that he was a little obsessed with food. Well, let me tell you: I had no idea.
A few weeks ago, I saw a sign on Houston Street that made me stop in my tracks: "Bereket Is Back!" Anybody who lived in the area in the 1990s remembers, and probably still pines for, Bereket's fantastically affordable doner kebabs, red-lentil soup and other Turkish foods. In The Times, Kaya Laterman has the story on why Bereket went away and how it managed to stage a comeback just a few yards from its old site.

Hunter Biden, Ironic Icon: [Style Desk]

Author: Bernstein, Joseph

Publication info: Bernstein, Joseph.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A tongue-in-cheek group that includes meme-loving Leftists, frat boys and women who like troubled men, has turned the president's son into an antihero.
When they look at Hunter Biden, many Americans don't like what they see -- and not just because of the images of the president's 53-year-old son in the midst of wild-eyed benders, which were leaked from his laptop and published online, first piecemeal and then in a massive batch in June.
Mr. Biden was indicted in September on federal gun charges, punctuating a half decade in which his personal and professional conduct have come under increased scrutiny. According to an Economist/YouGov poll that was conducted in August, two out of three Americans have an unfavorable view of him -- eleven points worse than the president performed in the same poll -- and nearly three out of four believe he personally profited from his father's positions in government.
But there are others -- more than you might think, and for different reasons -- who find the man in the laptop photos oddly alluring.
Steve Deleonardis of the popular Nelk Boys (think Barstool Sports meets "Jackass") said recently that he would love to hang out with Mr. Biden because of his propensity for nude selfies with prostitutes, not to mention his drug habit. Deleonardis doesn't like Mr. Biden out of any kind of partisan allegiance; the Nelk Boys have interviewed Donald Trump twice. Instead, he seems to like him because he sees a fellow party boy.
Last year, Thursday Lines, a popular Instagram meme account that celebrates recreational cocaine use, began selling $ 35 T-shirts touting a mock Hunter Biden 2024 presidential campaign. In a Thursday Lines Instagram story, a young man wearing the T-shirt opens a can of beer by slamming it into his forehead in a classic frat-bro motion.
"His lifestyle is super cool because he gets to do all the coke and crack he wants," said one of the hosts on a recent episode of "Wet Jeans," a lad-culture podcast. "And he gets to live in a home in like, Calabasas," referring to the gilded enclave north of Los Angeles.
"He's using taxpayer money to like, fund hookers and his ketamine habit," his co-host responded, excitedly. "I was thinking about it and I was like dude, I really ... love this guy."
The "Wet Jeans" hosts don't have their facts straight. Mr. Biden lives in Malibu; taxpayer money pays for his Secret Service detail but not his personal life; he says he has been sober since 2019; his ketamine use came as part of one of his many attempts at rehab.
But for these fans, the facts are almost beside the point. Mr. Biden -- addict, adulterer, influence trader, all-around black sheep -- has been transformed into a uniquely American antihero.
Mr. Biden also has many female fans, who find his combination of weathered looks, tawdry personal life (Mr. Biden briefly dated the widow of his older brother, Beau, who died in 2015), and traumatic childhood (Mr. Biden's mother and sister were killed in a car crash when he was 2) to be irresistible.
"There is this sensitive little boy part of him that appeals to women who want to fix a man," said Lara Schoenhals, a writer and performer who hosts the "SUP" podcast, about reality television. "He projects this sense that if you just love him enough, he'll be OK."
In a 2020 piece for Slate, Heather Schwedel, even anointed Mr. Biden as "hot."
"In one of the photos, he stares straight ahead with the kind of Top Gun intensity that's hard to achieve when one is wearing a jean jacket over a bare chest," she wrote. "That chest, and the stomach below it, appears tanned and surprisingly taut for a man his age. Each detail that might read as cheesy on someone else only augments the swagger: the shades, the stubble, the chain, the popped collar. The machismo is positively Federline-esque."
This all may come as a surprise to Americans who see, in Mr. Biden's creeping baldness and conspicuous veneers, a middle-aged nepo-baby.
But for a very online subculture of the meme-loving left -- who mostly loathe Joe Biden's more centrist politics -- Mr. Biden's hard living is indivisible from his strange charm; It has embraced the younger Mr. Biden as a lovable mascot of imperial rot. The standard bearers of this world, the co-hosts of the podcast "Chapo Trap House," have long regarded Mr. Biden with a kind of mordant, ironic delight.
"Who has a better life than Hunter Biden?" mused Will Menaker, one of the "Chapo" co-hosts, in a 2022 episode of the show, after a discussion of a video in which Mr. Biden plunges, nude, down a water slide.
(Mr. Biden does have a -- slim -- connection to the world of shock-jock hipster podcasts. Zoe Kestan, one of his girlfriends pictured in the laptop leaks, was an early guest on "Red Scare," a controversial chat show, in her capacity as "weedslut420," a marijuana lifestyle influencer.)
On Instagram accounts like "Neoliberalhell" and "Thenewmythology.jpg," an image of Mr. Biden using drugs in the bathtub is a refrain, often accompanied by captions that mix cruel irony with an awed respect for his libertinism -- "he's the last true auteur" or "feeling inspired might go on a bender" or "I smoke crack ethically."
"He was given every opportunity and he still ended up a degenerate," said Dan Lowe, a 40-year-old New Yorker who runs "Thenewmythology.jpg." "It's relatable."
In the "TrueUnpopularOpinion" subreddit, a user summarized Mr. Biden's appeal: "The president has a cool son ... and republicans are mad because they're jealous of him. Also Hunter could beat up any other presidents kids, guaranteed."
Much like Hunter Biden, American men keep hearing that they needs to get their act together.
Voices across the ideological spectrum have divergent proposals for how 21st century men should carry themselves in the world. The right has championed a series of severe cultural figures, from Josh Hawley to Jordan Peterson, who proselytize on behalf of "the masculine virtues America needs" (that's the subtitle of Senator Hawley's recent book, "Manhood"). Another camp -- call it the dissident center -- has produced swaggering figures like Joe Rogan, whose version of masculinity revolves around transgressive speech and macho self-mastery through martial arts.
Meanwhile, liberals are happy to diagnose the problem with men, but have had difficulty articulating a positive vision of maleness.
In this context, it's easy to see the Hunter Biden fandom as a response to the idea that many American men simply won't, or can't help themselves.
In the same episode of "Chapo Trap House," the co-host Felix Biederman ventriloquized this insecurity. "Oh my god, I'm never going to be my own man," he said. "Like, I'm not good at anything. I'm just this symbol of ... surplus and inefficiency."
Into the void steps Mr. Biden, a seemingly washed-up loser who somehow still gets invited to state dinners and travels on Air Force One.
In his memoir, "Beautiful Things," Mr. Biden writes of a brief stint living in Portland, Ore. as a young man, where he wore a leather jacket and sat around reading his favorite novel, "Post Office," by Charles Bukowski, "about a down and out barfly." It's hard not to see Mr. Bukowski, champion portraitist of the deadbeat, in Mr. Biden's book, which exhaustively chronicles -- one might say mythologizes -- his time on the margins.
The bad boy aspect of Mr. Biden's fan culture is clear enough. For the online frat pack, of course, it's way cooler to reign in hell (or at least a trashed suite at the Chateau Marmont) than serve in heaven.
"He's not the guy you date, but he's going to be a fun story," Rachel Napoleon, a host of the popular "Girls on Porn" podcast, said of Mr. Biden. "Something about being open and honest in his memoir leads us to subconsciously believe he will be open and honest in the bedroom."
Depressed, addicted, vulnerable: at odds with the grimly controlled version of masculinity put forth by the right -- and for that matter, with the quietly fearful and confused one of contemporary liberal culture.
"He's a wounded man with demons that he's constantly battling," said Ms. Schoenhals. "He's not afraid to cry or mourn or look sad."
The Prodigal Son Can Only Bear So Much Symbolism
The bad boy is a secular iteration of the biblical story of the prodigal son, who unlike his older brother, squanders his inheritance and his good name through drink, gambling, and sex with prostitutes. He has to deal with the shame of returning to his father, destitute.
Hunter Biden is famously the less accomplished of the Biden sons; his older brother, Beau, was widely seen as Joe Biden's political successor before dying of brain cancer. In "Beautiful Things," it's Beau's death that sets off the worst of Hunter Biden's binges -- the one that much of America has witnessed, thanks to the images found on his laptop. That it is photo evidence of this very, desperate behavior that has also produced Mr. Biden's idiosyncratic fandom perhaps says something about the depth and ubiquity of American male shame in 2023.
Of course, there's only so much symbolism one son can bear. And as an avatar for the radical acceptance of the downward trajectory of American men, Mr. Biden is characteristically imperfect.
He's been afforded a number of chances and a level of support, most notably from his own father, which most American men couldn't dream of. And even a cursory read of Mr. Biden's memoir is enough to pour cold water on the idea that his benders were much more than grinding episodes of addiction and grief, which put his family through an excruciating emotional ordeal. Plus, he's currently married, sober, and living in Malibu, where he makes paintings that sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Whatever else that is, it's the cultural opposite of down and out in the United States.

Full text: Alen MacWeeney
Through Jan. 7. New York Public Library, 476 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan; 917-275-6975, nypl.org/events/exhibitions.
Has there been another exhibition whose venue so perfectly suits its art? In one of the slender halls on the third floor of the New York Public Library's Fifth Avenue headquarters, a civic landmark, hang photos shot in the slender cars of the New York subway, another symbol of the city. Walk down the hall at N.Y.P.L., and you might be on a platform looking into a stopped train: In one car, a weary-looking straphanger scowls while a rider in a head scarf and coat looks beatific; in another, a young woman ogles a dandy.
The Irish photographer Alen MacWeeney, 84, took these 44 photos in 1977 after arriving in Manhattan to work for Richard Avedon. They nod to the subway shots of Walker Evans from four decades earlier, with one major difference: In most of them, MacWeeney cleverly enlarges two subway shots onto one sheet of photo paper; with no seam between them, they register as a continuous scene. That gives each print a subtle surrealism, as we absorb the breach in space and time across its two photos without recognizing that they began life separately: A woman rests her eyes in a car that, thanks to MacWeeney, appears to have expanded into a maze of graffitied walls; another car seems to show its inside and outside at once, like a Möbius strip.
"The chance encounter of a sewing machine and an umbrella on an operating table" -- that phrase by Isidore Lucien Ducasse is supposed to capture surrealism's signature weirdness. But what about the encounter of an umbrella with another moment in its own existence? That's the more peculiar strangeness we find in MacWeeney's subway. BLAKE GOPNIK

Through Oct. 21. Gagosian, 821 Park Avenue, Manhattan; 212-796-1228, gagosian.com.
Cady Noland, an exacting arranger of ready-made Americana, rarely debuts new work. Even her formidable career survey in 2018 took place not in her native United States but at the Museum für Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt. This notorious scarcity makes her sculptures an event, in the sense of sneakers or (say) vintage beer cans: Their appeal might puzzle the layperson, but thrill the collector.
This 2023 batch of sculptures, all untitled, gathers her studied red, white, blue, black and silver palette of cans and police gear into spare but menacing tableaus. Some strongly resemble work she made during the Reagan administration. One piece, an aluminum walker decorated with black straps, leather gloves and toy badges, is from 1983. Trays of Polaroids in the window sill offer installation views of Noland's work from previous decades, including veritable walls of Budweiser. Of course, many of her materials are themselves collectibles -- one sculpture pairs shiny chains and trash cans with '70s-era pull-tab Budweisers and a steel milk crate ominously stamped with the name of Pinkerton's National Detective Agency.
Other works confront the viewer with actual grenades and bullets, suspended in clear acrylic cubes, alongside badges and drink cans given the same treatment. The munitions have been drilled out and the gunpowder emptied. (Resin heats up as it cures.) The encased Buds and Cokes have been drained, too. They still contain the symbolism of a consumer culture protected with lethal force. Noland repeats herself, but then so does the country. TRAVIS DIEHL
Polina Barskaya
Through Oct. 21. Monya Rowe Gallery, 224 West 30th Street, No. 304, Manhattan; monyarowegallery.com.
Nothing much happens in Polina Barskaya's 13 new, modestly scaled paintings, which, given art's vogue for overstimulating a viewer into submission, is a relief. But then again, entire worlds churn under their softly constructed surfaces. The artist's muted depictions of herself, alone or with her husband and young daughter, can be startling, not for their voyeurism, which barely registers, but in their banality: They get in and out of bed, bathe and loaf in various states of undress. These are domestic tableaus minus the domicile; her scenes occur in hotel rooms and holiday rentals, private but transient, calm but not enough to escape anxiety.
Her concerns have an antecedent in the Intimists, the group of Post-Impressionist dissidents including Édouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard who, weary of the oppressive grandeur of the plein-air painters, moved their work inside, where they actually lived, transposing psychic turmoil into the intimacy of breakfast rooms and unmade beds. Barskaya's compositions are more stable than Bonnard's, but they share a vibratory ambiguity, each mark establishing the image but also disturbing it. These aren't romantic flourishes. The artist appears behind tired eyes, sunk into the far reaches of the room, an emotional distance that may as well be unreachable.
Barskaya, who was born in Soviet-era Ukraine and resides in Brooklyn, works from photos, which means the finished image is one of multiple consciousness -- the artist memorializing herself both in a specific moment and also her memory of it. What results in the translation is a minor but persistent melancholy, the realization of impermanence, an elegy for time and its evaporation. MAX LAKIN
Liz Magic Laser
Through Nov. 19. Pioneer Works; 159 Pioneer Street, Brooklyn, 718-596-3001, pioneerworks.org.
Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris is both famous and notorious. A wellspring for modern psychology and neurology -- Sigmund Freud trained there under Jean-Martin Charcot -- it's also known for popularizing the term "hysteria," a now discounted female malady. Salpêtrière is still a working hospital, though, and it serves as the stage for Liz Magic Laser's excellent film, "Convulsive States" at Pioneer Works.
The cast of the film, made in collaboration with the French journalist Laura Geisswiller, includes doctors, historians, therapists, clergy and artists. We visit a dance class for people with muscular dystrophy and gaze upon paintings by psychiatric patients. There are laboratories with beeping computer monitors and sculptures outside the hospital that conjure the troubled spirits of residents, past and present -- as well as a visit with the sculptor Fabrice Brunet, who also teaches tai chi and leads Laser through a few exercises.
Ultimately, the film and a series of eight smaller videos, with people performing various types of bodywork, explore psychosomatic disorders and how to treat them. Laser admits to her own mild afflictions -- although the doctors at Salpêtrière treat them with a shrug, rather than offering serious prescriptions. The project is interesting for showing the infinite approaches to pathology and treatment. If you're experiencing a twitch or convulsion, should you be exorcised (one priest here says he receives an occasional request to do so), or go to a yoga class or solicit medical experts? The answer is clearly tied to the time and place in which it's asked, but also who wields the power to make such decisions. MARTHA SCHWENDENER

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Cristaseya isn't trying to hide, it just knows that the right people will find it.
Cristaseya is a decade-old clothing line operated by Cristina Casini and her husband Andrea Spotorno, two Italians who moved to Paris nearly 20 years ago from Milan. If you're lucky enough to know about it, the best place to shop for Cristaseya is the second floor of nondescript office building at 7 Rue Ambroise Thomas in the 9th arrondissement. Not only because the entire collection is there -- "This is the atelier, the showroom, the store, everything," Ms. Casini said one afternoon during Paris Fashion Week in late September -- but because it is difficult to find the line elsewhere.
Casa Cristaseya, as the Rue Ambroise Thomas space is called, is open by appointment only. Many of those who make one have been directed there by a fashion-insider friend with good taste. For the artist Martine Syms, who has collaborated with Prada, it was the fashion publicist Poppy Edmonds. For Emily Rahimpour, a creative director in Los Angeles whose clients include Byredo, it was the stylist Charlotte Collet. For Zoë Ghertner, the fashion photographer who shoots campaigns for Miu Miu and Chloe, it was Christiane Juergensen, who works with Phoebe Philo.
"There is no way I would've found out about it had it not been introduced to me by someone that I know and work with," Ms. Ghertner said.
Of the 45 or so stores that carry Cristaseya, most are in Japan with a few in the United States, including Mameg in Los Angeles, Viola Lovely in Boston, Oroboro in New York and AP Shop, a seasonal boutique in Lakeside, Mich., that is open Friday to Monday, May through January. No other store in France besides Casa Cristaseya carries the collection, and Cristaseya is not sold in Italy, despite the fact that Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno are Italian and much of their fabric comes from Italy and their production is done there.
"They think about luxury in the sense of luxury," Ms. Casini said, indicating the use of the term as a catchall for a certain price, branding and marketing style rather than a measure of the quality of goods and services. "That is not really what we like. Already the word 'luxury,' I don't like it because it's a bit, I don't know, vulgar."
Words Ms. Casini does like include "discreet" and "rareness." In the small world of Cristaseya, Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno enjoy complete freedom and control. Everything is a reflection of their personal curiosities and pleasures: a big wooden table Mr. Spotorno designed, an exhibition of photography by Jacob Holdt held in a gallery space upstairs from the showroom.
The clothes bear the influence of traditional Italian and Japanese tailoring. (Keiko Seya, an original partner, left the company a few years ago and now runs the label Seya.) Ms. Casini was previously a stylist. Mr. Spotorno photographs and art directs all of the imagery for the collection, sometimes using Cristaseya's two other employees -- Wonji Hong, the collection director, and Herta Bernane, the sales director -- as models. The look is arty but playful. It's not sexy, but it's smart in its slightly twisted understatement.
Ms. Rahimpour was introduced to Cristaseya in its early days and was charmed by Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno's approach. At the time, Ms. Rahimpour was working as the in-house art director for Chanel Beauty.
"I entered the company at a time when it was like a family business, and then it became this multinational, and everything at the time was turning into a multinational," she said. "Cristaseya is more about the clothes and the experience. You go to the atelier, and there's this tactile element. Like, the clothes on your skin. You feel comfortable, the fabrics are extraordinary."
For years, big department stores, like Le Bon Marché and Galeries Lafayette, and major e-commerce sites, like Matchesfashion.com and Ssense, have been trying to add Cristaseya to their vast assortments, but Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno refuse to sell to them.
"When everything looks the same with everything together, it's not special," Ms. Casini said. "We don't want to see the product there. And if I were a Cristaseya client, I wouldn't want to see the product there." Ssense, in particular, is known for buying an incomprehensible number of brands, many of which are destined to end up 70 percent marked down. "It's a bit sick," Ms. Casini said.
Cristaseya never goes on sale. It is expensive. An oversize reversible Japanese wool coat -- tentlike yet somehow elegant -- with leather piping is 2,806 euro (about $ 2,975). An oversize shirt, handmade by the Neapolitan shirtmaker Salvatore Piccolo, is 594 euros. An oversize baby camel's hair sweater is 1,169 euro. The fabrics and silhouettes, mostly unisex with a slightly raw, textured hand, are much more interesting and appealing in person than online. The collection does not abide by the fashion industry's traditional seasonal model, wherein there's spring, fall and two pre-collections, all of which are available for that season and then never again.
Cristaseya releases editions, two per year, and pieces from all editions are constantly in the mix. Edition 1 was called Winter Sky, and everything was navy. Edition 2 was Shirting. Edition 3 was Camel. Editions 18 and 19 were Sardegna, for which Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno branched out into ceramics, a "pibiones" style rug, picked out in raised loops, and 18-karat gold filigree jewelry that he designed and executed with local artisans from Sardinia. All of the knitwear is produced by Ms. Casini's mother's company Maglierie Cristina in Reggio Emilia.
"She really does it with love," Ms. Casini said.
In the beginning, Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno tried to avoid selling the collection online. "It's something that you have to experience, to touch -- it's expensive," Ms. Casini said. "You have to listen to the story, the savoir faire and tra-la-la. But then obviously, it was not possible to not do any online."
They've adopted a quirky model. The online shop opens temporarily and seemingly arbitrarily -- a week here, a few days there -- posted to Cristaseya's email distribution list and on Instagram.
"I think it's interesting," said Salima Boufelfel, the owner of the Desert Vintage stores in Arizona and New York. "I like the feeling of it."
This limited-access modus operandi is less about driving hype and intrigue for hype and intrigue's sake, in the way that brands like Supreme have become famous for their drops, than about manpower and capacity. The four employees can handle only so much demand. "It's a lot of work," Mr. Spotorno said.
That said, clients can contact them at any time, and Ms. Bernane will send a link to a product page. "But it's not everybody contacting us," Ms. Casini said. "You really need to be very motivated."
This state of mind may make fashion giants shudder, but it's yielded a tight bond between Cristaseya and its clients. As Mr. Spotorno said, "We know them, they know us."

Rape, Race and Years-Old Lie That Still Wounds: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Farid El Haïry spent most of his adult life as a convicted rapist. Then his accuser changed her story.
The phone echoed in Farid El Haïry's home in northern France. It was February 1999.
A rural police officer was on the line, asking if he could come down to the gendarmerie for a chat.
"I asked them why and was it urgent," he says. It's nothing serious, he remembers being told. Come when you can. It won't take long.
Then a lanky 17-year-old about to start an apprenticeship in a bakery, Mr. El Haïry set out for the brick station a couple of days later. He grabbed some pains au chocolat and a Coke on the way for breakfast.
He would not return home for years.
He was charged with the sexual assault and rape of a 15-year-old girl from a neighboring high school, whom he knew only by sight and had never spoken to. The police had no witnesses, no corroborating evidence, just her word against his.
After a night at the gendarmerie, he was sent to a nearby prison that was notorious for overcrowding, drug use and suicide. He spent the next 11 months and 23 days in pretrial custody before being released with one painful condition -- stay away from his home city of Hazebrouck, where his accuser, but also his friends and family, lived.
At a trial in 2003, a jury found him guilty and sentenced him to five years in prison, but so much of it was suspended that he would not return to jail.
Since then, there have been two Farid El Haïrys -- the hyperactive teenager, described by classmates and relatives as a joker who played games and didn't take school seriously, and the sober adult, who hides his distrust behind a smiling facade and must always work to control the rage he describes as a "cancer burning inside of me."
Fuel for his rage included race. Mr. El Haïry, now 42, is the son of a Moroccan immigrant. He doubts a white citizen would have been charged on similarly flimsy evidence, let alone convicted. A growing pile of reports and court decisions show that racial profiling by the police is a serious, unaddressed problem in France.
For 23 years, Mr. El Haïry suppressed that anger -- until another unsettling phone call arrived, this one interrupting his family's Eid al-Fitr celebrations last year.
Again, it was the police.
There had been a development in his case, he learned. His accuser from so many years ago, now a mother herself, had been in touch. She had changed her story.
'Something Was Wrong'
Sitting in the gendarmerie on that morning in 1999, Mr. El Haïry assumed it was a mistake. So did his family.
"It was impossible," said his cousin Angélique Vanhaecke. "He never even talked to girls."
But over time, as the investigation continued and Mr. El Haïry suffered strip searches and solitary confinement, he began to feel differently.
"Something was wrong," he said on a recent walk around Hazebrouck to revisit the scenes of a crime that never happened.
"They were looking for a culprit," he added.
As a French Arab who grew up in his hometown's only housing project, he believed he made for a convenient one.
Hazebrouck is a middle-class city of 21,000 people in a region known for its rich farmland, work ethic and love of beer. Locals describe it as insular and quiet. Only 2 percent of residents were immigrants in 2019.
Before his parents rented a nearby house, Mr. El Haïry grew up in "the blocks" -- a group of subsidized high-rises where many of the town's few immigrant families lived.
His father worked at a steel plant in Dunkirk, 28 miles away. His mother, who grew up in Hazebrouck, was a cook in a hospice. Farid was the youngest of their three sons -- a wiry boy buzzing with energy who roared around the neighborhood on a bike.
"He liked to laugh, tease and roughhouse," Ms. Vanhaecke said. But, she added, "he wasn't violent at all."
As a teenager, Mr. El Haïry was stopped regularly for identity checks by the local police. Sometimes, he recalled, the same officers would stop him more than once a day.
Racial profiling by the police is a longstanding grievance in France. One 2017 study found that young men "perceived to be Black or Arab" were 20 times as likely to be subjected to identity checks compared with the rest of the population.
Mr. El Haïry had no criminal record.
Court documents give his accuser's original account: Mr. El Haïry had stopped her on the street one winter evening with a group of friends, described as of Northwest African origin. Together, they hauled her down an alley, pinned her down and molested her, she said.
She knew Mr. El Haïry only by sight. But he was known as "a violent individual."
Five months later, she crossed paths with Mr. El Haïry again near the public pool. This time, a different man, again described as of Northwest African origin, held her to the ground while Farid raped her. She said she had been a virgin.
Mr. El Haïry vehemently denied all of it.
The police were never able to identify the man from the second incident. The accuser did pick out three of Mr. El Haïry's friends from the first. Officers obtained initial statements from two that they had crossed paths with her alongside Mr. El Haïry.
Under questioning from a magistrate months later, however, the stories shifted. The two friends said they had been pressured into their statements by officers, and denied ever seeing Mr. El Haïry and the victim together. The accuser said while the friends had talked to her, only Mr. El Haïry had molested her.
The case went forward anyway.
"The police should have immediately, immediately, immediately said to themselves, 'It's not just one thing that is inconsistent, it's a lot of things,"' Mr. El Haïry said.
The gendarmerie in Hazebrouck declined to comment. They had not kept records of the investigation, an official said, and none of the officers involved still worked there.
After being released from custody, Mr. El Haïry moved into an uncle's apartment in Pantin, a Paris suburb.
His parents traveled three hours to bring him groceries regularly. "I saw how my parents suffered," said Christian El Haïry, Farid's eldest brother. "They lost their little boy."
Mr. El Haïry was required to report weekly to a police station, which often took hours. He lost his first job as a shoe salesman because he couldn't explain the absences. He struggled to keep and make friends because he worried they would find out.
"He was broken," Ms. Vanhaecke said. "He had a joie de vivre. From one day to the next, it was gone."
A Surprise Letter
The accuser cried continually through the trial, which lasted two days.
The prosecution relied on her story, a gynecological exam and psychiatric reports that assessed her as credible, suffering from a severe lack of self-esteem and disgust with sexuality. She was also a good student, they noted. Mr. El Haïry was deemed immature, egocentric and defensive. He had been suspended from school repeatedly.
Martin Grasset, Mr. El Haïry's lawyer during the trial, saw the verdict as a partial victory. His client would not return to jail -- a sign, he thought, that the jury had sensed holes in the case.
"It's behind him," Mr. Grasset recalled thinking at the time.
From the outside, it seemed that way.
Mr. El Haïry went on to manage a shoe store before switching to a mobile phone business in Lille. He married, bought a house and had two children.
But the conviction hung over him.
His name was added to the national sex offender registry.
In a brief article about the trial, which had been held behind closed doors, a local newspaper printed his name.
People looked at his family differently, said his brother Christian. "We all held a bit of hate in our heart," he said.
Then, last year, Mr. El Haïry's life was upended again by a call from the police. The accuser had written to the local prosecutor in 2017, admitting she had lied.
"Mr. Farid El Haïry isn't guilty of anything and never committed any actions of sexual violence or rape against me," her letter read. It claimed that she had been raped by her older brother from the ages of 8 to 12, and had only been released from the "grip of family secrecy" after years of therapy.
"I wish to set the record straight," she wrote. "I feel ashamed and guilty with regard to Farid El Haïry. He didn't deserve this."
After the call, Mr. El Haïry rushed to tell his parents. His mother, then 69, was in palliative care with kidney failure.
"She said to me, 'Don't worry Farid, I won't die,"' said Mr. El Haïry, recounting the scene. "'I will be in the courtroom when you are exonerated."' Soon after, she moved back home.
But she was too sick to travel to Paris last December when judges on France's top appeals court exonerated her son.
After the ruling, Mr. El Haïry dropped his head in his hands. His lawyers patted his back, calling the case "historic."
Since 1945, only about 15 people convicted of serious crimes, like murder or rape, have been exonerated or found not guilty in France after a retrial, experts say.
That offered little solace. Stepping out of the courtroom, Mr. El Haïry was in tears.
"I did one year of imprisonment, but the 23 years of mental imprisonment are what's hardest," he told reporters. "One family was destroyed to protect another."
Just over two weeks later, Mr. El Haïry's father died of a heart attack. His mother died a few months after that.
Julie's Story
Farid's accuser was a girl named Julie.
Now in her 40s, she agreed to meet at her lawyer's office on condition that we not reveal her family name or where she now lived. At the same time she wrote the letter about Mr. El Haïry, she sent another one to prosecutors, accusing her older brother of repeated rape. That investigation continues.
She talked for more than two hours, breaking into tears a few times. The story is still raw for her, too.
Julie was born and raised in Hazebrouck, where her family used to own a textile business.
When she sent the letters in 2017, she had been carrying the lie for almost two decades. Several things pushed her to confess.
She had recently given birth to her first child, a son, and was terrified the pattern of incest would repeat itself.
That summer, a victim's aid counselor urged her to come clean.
In the fall, the #MeToo movement erupted. It inspired her, she said, even though her experience contradicted what many other activists at the time were saying -- that the police regularly dismiss rape victims as liars.
"#MeToo is about the liberation of speech," she said. "So I spoke out, this time to tell the truth."
When she was 14, Julie's first consensual sex with her boyfriend resurfaced traumatic memories of her brother's incest, she said, triggering a gnawing anxiety.
"I fell asleep with the fear of rape," she said.
Around the same time, her boyfriend clashed with Mr. El Haïry and became so scared of him that he refused to go downtown, just to avoid him. As Julie describes it, her fear of rape meshed with her boyfriend's fear of Mr. El Haïry, and her decision to lie emerged from a teenager's confusing jumble of feelings.
"I think it was a survival instinct," she said. "I needed to speak out."
While Mr. El Haïry is convinced that race and class influenced the police investigation and court case, Julie is less sure.
"From my adolescent perspective, it was not at all something that I saw or perceived," she said. "Did it play a role? I don't know."
She did say, however, that every time she went to the "blocks" for dance classes, she was scared.
Once cast, the lie shielded her: She was recognized as a victim within her family without tearing it apart. The incest never reoccurred afterward, she said.
The story she told the police matched a common rape myth -- that most rapists are strangers lurking in street shadows. In fact, "perpetrators are predominantly close relatives," said Audrey Darsonville, a criminal law professor at the University of Nanterre.
Malicious or fictitious accusations of rape are extremely rare, Ms. Darsonville noted, but it is not uncommon for minors -- especially incest victims -- to initially accuse the wrong perpetrator.
"It's a kind of cry for help," she said, from victims who cannot bring themselves to name the family member abusing them.
Julie initially told a handful of friends that she had been raped by Mr. El Haïry. One evening, her two brothers overheard and told their parents. She did not want to file a complaint, she insisted, but her parents took her to see a psychologist, who alerted the authorities.
The investigation was a blur, she said. The psychologist and her mother sat in for her police interview. She barely interacted with her lawyer. She felt an "extreme solitude" and later became bulimic.
She was trapped in her lie. But Julie also acknowledged she did nothing to defuse it, even after it put an innocent teenager in prison for nearly a year.
In 2003, when she received a letter summoning her to court for the trial, she recalls thinking: "Either I kill myself, or I denounce my brother, or I go."
So she went.
Now, as an adult and as a mother, she is coming to terms with her decisions. Her life was also cleaved in halves that she is now trying to restitch -- the girl who was the victim of abuse, and the teenager who told a harmful lie to save her.
"One protected the other," she said. "I had the right words, but not for the right person."
No Vindication
For over two decades, Mr. El Haïry imagined the moment when the lie would be exposed, his reputation redeemed and his lives welded.
But that is not what happened.
"I didn't feel what I thought I would feel," he said over lunch in a Hazebrouck tavern. "I was screwed over for 24 years, and it took 30 seconds to exonerate me."
Stories about the case ran on the national 8 o'clock news and in local and national newspapers. But true to the city's tight-lipped reputation, the revelation caused little stir in Hazebrouck. Walking around the main square on market day, few locals knew about it. A former classmate running a bakery said he hadn't known about Mr. El Haïry's conviction in the first place.
The city's current mayor, who was 6 at time of Mr. El Haïry's arrest, said he considered the case a personal affair and not a reflection of Hazebrouck, which he pointed out has no history of serious crime or police abuse.
But in the blocks where Mr. El Haïry's family is still known, the exposed injustice stings.
"No one believed it," said Moustapha Zidane, 47, a youth worker at the neighborhood's small community center. "We were stigmatized by the police."
Mr. El Haïry's North African heritage and his connection to the impoverished neighborhood made him an "easy target," Mr. Zidane said.
"If you aren't the same color as others, it's not OK," concurred Évelyne Lazoore, 63, outside the local primary school, where she had just dropped off her niece. "He was put in prison for nothing."
Mr. El Haïry has filed a complaint against Julie, accusing her of wrongfully accusing him. An investigation is continuing.
He stews with anger at the justice system.
He learned about Julie's first letter nearly five years after she sent it. Court summons for Mr. El Haïry were sent to the wrong address. The pandemic further delayed things. But even for France, a country where the wheels of the overburdened judiciary often move slowly, his exoneration process was particularly long, experts say.
"I could have enjoyed five years of that liberty and innocence with my parents," he said bitterly.
Mr. El Haïry is also seeking damages from the state to compensate for the hardship of his imprisonment and conviction.
It is unclear how much he might be entitled to. In 2012, a man who had spent over seven years in prison on false rape charges received nearly 800,000 euros, or over $ 840,000, but Mr. El Haïry had far less jail time.
For him, the main loss is immaterial -- the life he might have lived, the person he might have been.
Since he learned of Julie's confession, Mr. El Haïry's nights are sleepless again. He spends them turning over every detail of the case, asking questions that might never be satisfactorily answered. Just when he should be released from the lie, he is consumed by it.
"It's my lullaby," he said.

Full text: The counterman's treat, tying ties in Sunnyside and more reader tales of New York City in this week's Metropolitan Diary.
The Counterman
Dear Diary:
I was with my daughters. They were 5 and 3 at the time. We were at the counter of a coffee shop on Lexington Avenue that had recently opened. The girls were having custard-filled doughnuts and Cokes. I was having a chocolate doughnut and coffee.
The man next to me said to the counterman that he had given him a $ 10 bill, and had gotten change for a five.
The counterman checked the register.
"There is no $ 10 bill here," he said.
The man became loud and accusatory.
Without saying anything, the counterman handed him a $ 5 bill.
The man left, red-faced and muttering.
I opened my purse to pay.
"Let me treat you," the counterman said.
I'm not one to accept gifts easily, and never from strangers.
"Why should you?" I asked. "I have no problem paying. I can afford this."
"At least let me treat the bambinos," he said.
He stood in front of me, waiting as I hesitated.
"Say thank you," I said to my daughters.
-- Helen Tzagoloff
Neckties
Dear Diary:
It was a Sunday afternoon in August. I was walking home and about a block away from my apartment in Sunnyside when a woman approached me.
"Excuse me, sir," she said with a slight accent. "Do you know how to tie a necktie?"
She was holding two black ties. She explained that she, her husband and her son were going to a funeral. Her husband and son wanted to wear the ties but didn't know how to tie them.
Could I do this without a mirror, I wondered. It turned out to be one of those things you never forget, like riding a bicycle.
I did one, and then the other, each time leaving a loop large enough to lift over my head.
The woman thanked me, and I said it was one of the most unusual requests I had ever received.
"I was trying to find a cleaner's," she said, "but then I saw you."
-- Gary Matson
View From Above
Dear Diary:
In 1998, I went to see Kathleen Chalfant in "Wit." I sat in the front row of the mezzanine. Because I'm on the short side, the railing at the front of the section blocked my view of the stage.
I asked the usher if he had any cushions I could sit on.
He said he did not. Then he said he had an idea and would be right back.
He soon returned with six stacks of Playbills, three to put under me and three to put behind.
I had a great view.
-- Judy Epstein
Summer '22
Dear Diary:
It was summer 2022. I was running with my friends at the time -- 10 of them, plus my older brother -- from the Museum of Modern Art to Penn Station to catch a 6:30 train back to New Jersey for an 8:30 reservation at Olive Garden.
The air smelled like falafel, and the city around us felt as alive and young as we did. I was about to turn 16. I was in New York, and the only bad thing I could imagine happening to me at that moment was missing the 6:30 train.
The people running along behind me were my best friends, girls I had whispered secrets to at sleepovers and made popcorn with in the microwaves in their kitchens.
It did not occur to me that within a year, I wouldn't speak to any of them anymore, not a single one, or that precisely a year later, around the time of my 17th birthday party, I would uncap my pen and cross their names off the guest list.
None of that mattered -- nothing mattered, except catching the 6:30 train.
I waved my hand in the air and, as the hazy New York sunset swallowed us whole, called out to my friends to follow me because our train was leaving in five minutes.
-- Preeya Govil
'What's Downstairs?'
Dear Diary:
In the 1990s, I traveled to New York from the Netherlands several times a year. On one trip, I popped into a small drugstore on 47th Street to buy toothpaste on an especially hot summer day.
I couldn't immediately find the toothpaste, but then I saw a staircase to the basement. I turned to an older man who worked there.
"What's downstairs?" I asked him.
"Everything that isn't upstairs!" he said.

Full text: How Miuccia Prada -- and Miu Miu -- became the muse of the season. Plus a detour through Chanel and Louis Vuitton.
Want to know what you will wear next?
Quite possibly a rah-rah skirt so short it shows your rear end or (if you are of a mind-set that eschews rah-rah skirts) a pencil skirt or pair of trousers or even pair of men's swim trunks that sit so low on the hips they flirt with bumster-dom. They'll probably be cinched with a wide leather belt or at the very least expose the elastic logo waistband of your underwear.
With them, a schoolboy striped Oxford shirt, navy V-neck sweater and navy blazer. Or maybe you'll forget the pants and skirts entirely -- too much to think about! -- and just toss a jeweled flapper wrap dress or a gold brocade opera coat over your shirt. Then you might stuff an extra pair of shoes, the kind that gave you blisters so you had to put Band-Aids on your heels but you love them so you'll take them anyway, into your handbag before sprinting out the door.
Or that's what you may wear next if what appeared on the Miu Miu catwalk at the close of Paris Fashion Week is any indication.
But why, you say, scratching your head, would Miu Miu have anything to do with it?
Not just because the show was fantastic -- one that seemed to be channeling Simone de Beauvoir or Natalia Ginzburg en route to the flower market after a late night of pub quizzes and philosophical debate.
But because ever since Miuccia Prada enlisted Raf Simons as co-creative director at Prada in Milan, freeing herself up to pay more attention to what had always been seen as Prada's little sister line, the Miu Miu brand -- not to mention Mrs. Prada's whole aesthetic -- has quietly become one of the most influential in fashion.
If in doubt, simply consider the number of audience members who arrived at the show in hot pants and tights (not since the age of Mary Quant have so many upper thighs been so visible). Or consider how much Mrs. Prada's work has shaped what has appeared on other catwalks since this fashion month began.
Indeed, it would not be overstating things to say Mrs. Prada has been the muse of the season.
The Mrs. Prada Effect
It started during New York Fashion Week, when Joseph Altuzarra offered up what was essentially an ode to early Prada in cocooning uniform coats, sheer pencil skirts and frumpy knits -- a theme that was repeated three weeks later in Paris at Matthew M. Williams's show for Givenchy, which featured similar Prada-isms in pastel shades speckled among his lithe black dresses (elegant, but generic).
In Milan, short shorts -- the kind that looked an awful lot like the hot pants Mrs. Prada showed for Miu Miu last season, which were an evolution of the truncated skirts she showed the season before -- became the trend of the week at Gucci, Bally and Etro. Versace embraced the concept of the shorts set, which came in the wake of the Miu Miu set renaissance of early 2022.
Hot pants -- dotted with costume jewels even -- popped up again at Stella McCartney, paired with ruffled tuxedo shirts and cool suiting, amid the backdrop of the designer's sustainability market showcasing various material technologies, and a host of her own greatest hits. Even Victoria Beckham, who seems to be struggling to find a new fashion identity, threw some bodysuits, with undies peeking out around the edges, under cardigans into her mix of tailoring and transparency.
It's not that anyone is overtly referencing Mrs. Prada (or it's not like most of them are). But she has become so masterful at cozying up to the clichés of gender, burrowing down and recontextualizing them, so good at using clothes to wrestle with the desire to be pretty and frivolous and serious and stressed all at the same time that her work has started to shape the culture it reflects. In the real world of the street, and the digital world of influencers.
At which point it gets regurgitated back through the maw of other designers, amplifying the ideas. It's not trickle down or trickle up as much as trickle out.
A Detour to Vuitton and Chanel
The Miu Miu effect marks a pretty big shift in the biorhythms of fashion month. After all, years ago, when Mrs. Prada moved her Miu Miu show to Paris to create some breathing room between it and the Prada show in Milan, it was a sort of an addendum, or coda, to the week, after the mega brands of Chanel and Louis Vuitton had brought the season to an end. Lately, however, those shows seem increasingly niche; not smaller physically, but speaking mostly to an echo chamber of their own (paid) celebrities and acolytes.
Vuitton, for example, was held in the brand's new building on the Champs-Élysées, a former Art Deco palace hotel, now a construction site for what the brand would only describe as "a new project."
The soaring ground floor interior had been shrink-wrapped in orange plastic (100 percent recycled and 100 percent recyclable said the show notes) to resemble the interior of a hot-air balloon because, you know, travel (and the brand's birth as a trunk maker). And because the clothes from the designer Nicolas Ghesquière -- layers of striped and plaid mousseline belted at the hip, with leather jackets, candy-cane clown pants and elaborately beaded tweeds -- had their own floaty fussiness to match.
They were complicated-looking, no matter how light the construction, which paradoxically gave them a very French air. You don't want to wear them, but they are compelling all the same. Even if they also seem like a very acquired taste that might take too much effort to acquire, like sweetbreads.
At Chanel, meanwhile, Virginie Viard was riffing on the Villa de Noailles, the 1920s artistic salon in the South of France and the creative milieu Coco shared, with bouclés and seaside stripes, long-line bathing suits and flirty cover-ups, logos and flowers and pearls galore. The problem is, for every great piece -- a pleated black and white halter neck gown, for example, or a kind of ironically fun tweed caftan -- there's another that has all the subtlety of boardwalk souvenir shop Chanel without any of the irony.
"Whatever"
It's Mrs. Prada's self-awareness and ability to both love fashion and recognize the issues with it, to embrace the inherent tensions and related absurdity of even worrying about such tensions, that makes it possible for so many to recognize themselves (or their many selves) in her work.
"Fashion comes when you want a distraction, when you are not too serious," she said after the Miu Miu show. "But then you need to think about the rest, so you need clothes you can live with, and clothes that you can think with."
During the show, a piece of video art titled "Gravity & Grace" from the Qatari-American artist Sophia Al-Maria played on screens set up around the venue, featuring a stuntwoman, Ayesha Hussain, in those Prada hot pants, gas station jackets and knee-high boots, going through different exercises with a sword and a cross bow, and twirling around like a jewel-box ballerina. It didn't have much to do with what was on the runway, other than evincing, the show notes said, "a congruent intellectual viewpoint."
At the finale, after Cailee Spaeny -- the actor who plays Priscilla Presley in Sofia Coppola's coming biopic "Priscilla" -- had walked out in a plain black coat, the video flashed a close-up of a gum-chewing face and the word "whatever."
It was the perfect ending.

Newsom Vetoes Bill That Sought to Ban Discrimination Based on Caste: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The News
Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have made California the first state in the country to expressly ban discrimination based on caste, stating that the measure was "unnecessary" because it was already covered by existing laws.
Why It Matters: The bill reflects divisions in the state's South Asian community and its influence as a growing demographic.
The bill, known as Senate Bill 403, had driven intense debate -- and divisions -- within the growing South Asian community in California recently, especially in Silicon Valley, where South Asians make up a significant share of the work force.
Governor Newsom's rejection of the bill is a victory for some Hindu residents and organizations who had argued that the proposal unfairly targeted them because the caste system is most commonly associated with Hinduism. They asserted that caste discrimination in the United States was rare and that existing laws banning discrimination on the basis of ancestry and religion were sufficient.
"This has been months of concern and stress that we've been carrying about the impact that this would have on the civil rights of all South Asians regardless of background, and we're glad the governor saw the problems with it," said Suhag Shukla, executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, one of the organizations leading the opposition.
It comes as a blow to proponents of the bill who had argued that an explicit ban on caste discrimination was needed to increase awareness that such bias exists in the United States and to reassure victims who want to come forward. A group of South Asian activists had been on a hunger strike outside of Mr. Newsom's office since early September to urge the governor to sign the bill.
In recent years, several universities and companies have added caste to their discrimination policies. Late last month, Fresno officially became the first city in California, and the second in the country after Seattle, to enact such a ban. But Governor Newsom is considering a future run for the White House, and he may not have wanted to get in the middle of longstanding ethnic and religious tensions among some Indian Americans, who are a fast-growing and vital demographic in purple suburbs and swing states.
This month, Republican state legislators, who largely opposed the measure, sent Mr. Newsom a letter echoing arguments from the bill's opponents.
Background: There has been growing awareness in America of caste discrimination.
For thousands of years, Dalits have been a historically oppressed group of people relegated below even the lowest rung of the caste hierarchy in South Asia. India officially outlawed caste discrimination more than 70 years ago, but attitudes and social stratification persist.
In more than a dozen recent interviews with The New York Times, people of Dalit ancestry described various encounters with caste-based bigotry in the United States, in the form of wage theft, housing discrimination, mistreatment in the workplace and social exclusion.
For decades, the South Asian diaspora was composed mainly of upper caste people, in part because they had greater access to the resources necessary to qualify for skilled worker visas. More recently, though, affirmative action policies in India have allowed more people from oppressed communities to attend universities and move abroad.
The caste issue burst into the public conversation in 2020 when California's Civil Rights Department sued Cisco Systems, accusing two of the company's engineers of caste discrimination. Awareness of such discrimination has grown since then, and in March, Aisha Wahab, a California state senator, introduced Senate Bill 403. Senator Wahab's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
What's Next: Legal battles continue.
California lawmakers are not expected to override the veto. But other states and cities could introduce measures banning caste discrimination.
State regulators in California have continued to pursue their lawsuit against Cisco, though they dismissed their claims against the engineers.
Opponents of the bill are likely to continue arguing against new protections. Last year, two Hindu professors sued California State University, hoping to block its addition of caste to its discrimination policy.

Wait, Is That a Live Butterfly in Your Skirt?: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nothing is what you think it is any more. Two great collections from Dries Van Noten and Undercover prove that's OK.
The sense that things are not as they seem, that all the recognizable signposts suddenly look different and the world as you know it has gone topsy-turvy, is currently an everyday lament. You can have an existential crisis about it, or you can use it as a fuel for creativity. Surrealism followed the First World War; abstract expressionism, the Second. Often the worst of times produces the most interesting art.
Or, in this case, confusing times make for great fashion.
As Dries Van Noten said backstage after a show that twisted, torqued and otherwise rendered alien many of the basic building blocks of the preppy wardrobe, it was about taking "things that you really know but done in a completely upside down, inside out, special, strange way." Acknowledging the way the familiar can be unfamiliar.
Jun Takahashi took it even further after a dazzling Undercover show that was essentially an elegy for a lost world (and lost friends, the designer added afterward through a translator), saying that sometimes you have to "delete everything" to start again.
The extraordinary thing about both collections was that they conveyed this dizzying sense of dislocation in such a graceful way. This wasn't about making, as Mr. Van Noten said, "sad clothes" (things are sad enough all on their own), or angry clothes (ditto). It was about asserting the possibility that out of the sadness comes hope for what's next. Not about losing your bearings but finding them in unexpected places -- and garments. Who wouldn't want to wear that?
Mr. Van Noten did it by using khakis and striped shirting, rugby shirts and denim, the utility materials of a wardrobe, and then repurposing them so they became something entirely new. One ankle-length trench -- that kind that would sweep in and out of a room -- was thrown over a knit leopard 1920s-era maillot worn with a crisp seaside-stripe shirt/cover-up: From the Croisette to the conference room in one dramatic entrance.
That same shirting became the trim on a navy sweatshirt that slouched off one shoulder, like a figment of the "Flashdance" past, and was worn with drawstring trousers in a mustard and faded red rugby stripe. The khaki was tied up in knots in the best way, to shape a day dress. Later, a baroque silk scarf print and some fish scale paillettes appeared in the mix, though most of the embellishment was left to the shoes, dripping in beads.
Mr. Van Noten has a knack for making tailoring look as lived-in as pajamas, and jeans seem as serious as a suit. In his hands, undermining assumptions (including about what qualifies as "comfort clothing") becomes a desirable thing.
Mr. Takahashi, meanwhile, took the suit, stripped it down to its innards and skeletal seams and then patched it back together out of objects and memories -- playing cards here, a straight edge there; a slice of a Chanel-style jacket here, feathery wings over there -- before trapping it all under a veil of filmy georgette (or some sort of georgette-like technical fabric), so each piece had an entire life beating just below the surface.
The same veiling turned shorts into trousers, like a scrim over the calves; shadowed sweatshirts and bomber jackets; and trailed behind tuxedo suiting (some shoulders speckled with spiders, spinning their own webs), like the wisps of a story once told. There were more life stories in the paintings of Neo Rauch, the German artist whose work merges autobiography and industrial alienation and was reproduced on suits and dresses. And more courtesy of the blank faces from Mr. Takahashi's own paintings, remade in skirts of densely packed frills.
At the end, four perky prom dresses with full plastic miniskirts appeared, illuminated from within to reveal whole gardens trapped beneath their domes: tiny dioramas of Eden, complete with flowers and live butterflies that flittered around. The butterflies would be set free after the show, Mr. Takahashi said. How's that for a metaphor?

Lisa, Baltimore Designers do sometimes ask their models to smile. Giorgio Armani did it this season for his Emporio Armani show. When she was alive, Sonia Rykiel used to do it all the time; she even had her models skip down the catwalk to add extra zest. And it is almost always ... terrifying.
The truth is, it's awfully hard to maintain a believable expression of great joy when you are walking in front of hundreds, if not thousands, of strangers, all there to render their judgment on what you are wearing. As a model, your shoes probably don't fit, since they are samples, and you are concentrating very hard to avoid slipping or falling, and you are modeling chiffon in winter or leather in September, and you are partially blinded by the flashes of a zillion photographers.
Besides, while clothes are meant to make consumers feel good, they should also make them feel safe, strong, confident, protected. Michael Kors used to have posters backstage scrawled with phrases like "own the room" and "walk like you mean it" to inspire his models. That kind of pantomiming doesn't always come with a beaming face. Smiling can make one seem like a supplicant, and fashion is supposed to make you feel powerful in your skin.
Little wonder, really, that when a happy face is required, it turns, very quickly, into a frozen rictus that doesn't reach the eyes -- a facial disjunction that can be very disturbing to watch. It's hard to concentrate on clothes when you are wondering if the woman who is wearing them has a knife secreted somewhere.
That is why Tyra Banks always instructed the contestants on "America's Next Top Model" to "smize," or "smile with your eyes." Smiling with your actual mouth for the length of a runway generally looks just plain weird.
Aside from a brief period in the 1970s when models like Pat Cleveland danced down the runways, or the moment in 1991 when the supermodels from George Michael's "Freedom!" strutted down the Versace runway lip-syncing to the song, or that time in 1993 when Naomi Campbell fell off her Vivienne Westwood platforms and couldn't help bursting into laughter, smiles have rarely been the runway expression of choice. Look at any vintage photo of a classic couture salon, like Chanel or Christian Dior, and the mannequins are entirely po-faced.
Remember: The absence of a smile is not the same thing as the absence of attitude.

Full text: There are some people in fashion with such distinctive personal style trademarks that you can recognize them from their silhouettes. Karl Lagerfeld was one (remember the Diet Coke bottles?). Anna Wintour is another. And then, with her sky-high heels, narrow pencil skirts, shaggy bob and permanent presence on the front row of fashion week for more than 30 years, there is Carine Roitfeld.
The former French Vogue editor and stylist was a longtime collaborator with the likes of Mr. Lagerfeld and Tom Ford, as well as a principal architect of the hedonistic aesthetic that defined late 1990s fashion. After leaving French Vogue in 2011, she founded her own biannual publication, CR Fashion Book, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. The latest cover, released earlier this week, stars Kim Kardashian with razor-thin brows, a dirty white top and a buzz-cut wig, and was shot by Nadia Lee Cohen.
Lately Ms. Roitfeld has also been busy building a lifestyle empire, branching out into everything from perfumes to housewares as well as a new coffee-table book, "Fantasies," published earlier this month by Rizzoli (with a cover also featuring Ms. Kardashian).
She now occasionally uses a cane, but after turning 69 earlier this month, Ms. Roitfeld also appears to show no signs of slowing down. At the end of Milan Fashion Week -- and ahead of a big birthday bash in Paris on Sept. 27 -- she sat down to discuss getting older, her hand in shaping the intersection of fashion and pop culture and why she has no regrets about going it alone.
This interview has been edited and condensed.
In Milan, there were two major debuts at the houses of Gucci and Tom Ford. Given your long involvement with both of those brands, what did you think of what you saw?
The Tom Ford show was emotional for me because there were a lot of familiar faces in that room, including Peter [Hawkings], the new creative director who was Tom's right hand man and whom I have known for a long time. It was sexy, with a lot of references to the creative force of what Tom did both at Gucci and for his own brand. With Sabato [De Sarno] at Gucci, he is also a lovely guy. He was so unlucky with the weather and the fact the show location had to change. It was meant to be held in the streets, not a big black box. But it felt like a palate cleanser, and a real fresh start. Now he'll need to build on it.
You've been coming to Milan for almost 30 years. How has the way sex is presented on the fashion week runways changed since then?
I think it is more sanitized. I do think the 1990s were the best time for music and for fashion. And I think that is because people felt they had more freedom. Now we live in an age of anxiety where people are worried about everything -- like if they might get photographed by a cellphone or how they look on social media. That shapes people's sexuality and how they present themselves. There might be a lot of short shorts, but they don't always feel that sexy, you know? There was an emotional charge to many shows back then.
But I still see good shows that touch on sex now. The oozing latex curtain wall on the Prada runway this week felt very sensual to me. That was smart.
How has fashion week changed?
Social media has changed everything. There was no Instagram. The front row is now as much for TikTokers as it is for the people who have worked in fashion for 20 or 30 years. When everything is geared to be consumed online, something gets lost in the offline experience. Everyone films at the end of a show. No one is clapping.
Things change, I know that. But there is less space for us and I think it is a bit sad. For example, I couldn't congratulate Sabato after his show -- there were so many people backstage, all not talking, just holding up their phones and blocking the way. I waited for 10 minutes. Then I just gave up.
You've turned 69. Not a conventional big birthday to celebrate.
It's a good number. And I plan to stay 69 forever now, that's my new permanent age. So why not celebrate my last birthday party. It's going to be at Raspoutin, which is a nightclub in Paris my father used to go and sort of feels like home. Plus I have a lot going on that I feel proud of, like 10 years of CR Fashion Book. There are a lot of memories and we created a lot of great moments and careers in fashion. We, not me. I do not think of myself as a me, me, me person. Fashion is a team business. So my colleagues deserve to have a party, too.
When you look back on the last 10 years, what makes you proud?
When I left French Vogue, it was like giving back a royal crown. It's a huge title, everyone loved you and wanted your approval. And then I left, and then there was no team, no secretary, no automatic audience. Certain photographers were not allowed to work with me anymore. But it was really good for me to break out on my own at that stage in life. It forced me to find new contacts, look for new talent and do something that was truly my own.
Kim Kardashian is your cover star for the latest CR Fashion Book.
Yes and she's the cover of my new book, too. We have shot her before for CR Fashion Book -- working with Karl Lagerfeld and Riccardo Tisci. This time round, as you've seen, we shot her in a very surprising way. We've done a second cover with Jennifer Aniston, too.
Tell me about your tattoos. Are they new?
Yes, I've had them for about three or four months. On one finger is an Orthodox classic cross as I was raised in the Russian Orthodox Church. Then on another it says Odesa in Russian letters, where my family is from, and another says Paris. And I have the initials of those I love, and a small red band of thorns. I waited a long time to get these done -- 69 years. I had a lot of time to think about what to get.
On the subject of new things, you've also just started a housewares line.
Well yes, it's candles and diffusers for now, it's not furniture -- yet. But I do think smell is very important, it's very sensual and one of your very first impressions of a space. They're black. They're very chic. They're very me.
Then there is a new fragrance.
Yes, it's on me. Can you smell it? Forgive Me is the name. There is a lot of patchouli and white flowers. Making fragrances is very addictive, and I'd already got 7 Lovers [a perfume collection named for cities that inspire her and imaginary lovers in each of them]. Last year was Carine. And now this. The face of it will be my daughter, because she's very beautiful. Maybe the next one will have my granddaughter in the campaign.
Is family important to you?
Very. We are a small family but a very close one. My son, Vladimir, is my C.E.O. I dream of creating a new dynasty, a family fashion business that keeps creating the Roitfeld world.
When will you retire?
I don't have the luxury to retire. Honestly, I have too much going on and I'm not ready to stop and I am surrounded by people who are 25, which keeps me young. I think if I stopped it would just be boring.
But I have been making some life changes. I do sports and I have good DNA, and I'm lucky my body hasn't changed that much. But my skirts are now knee length, no matter what the new trends are. In Paris, I moved from the Left to the Right Bank. Anyone in Paris will tell you that to cross the river is a huge thing to do. And I've had to have five operations on my back. I do get tired; I do get worried I'll fall. So I use a cane now if I need to.
And where did you buy your cane or who makes it for you?
Amazon. 15 euros. A bargain!

Tom Conway, 71, Leader Of the Steelworkers Union Who Lent an Ear to Biden: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A tough but pragmatic negotiator, he led his union through decades of tumult, then helped drive through the president's infrastructure plans.
Tom Conway, the president of the United Steelworkers union and a friend and unofficial adviser to President Joe Biden, died on Monday at his home in Pittsburgh. He was 71.
His sons Justin and Philip said the cause was lung cancer.
Mr. Conway, who joined the union as a 26-year-old millwright in 1978 and was named its president in 2019, lived through a tumultuous time in his industry, as the once mighty United States steel sector struggled under the twin pressures of deindustrialization at home and cheap imports from abroad.
Today the steel industry is stable and profitable, and the union has 850,000 members -- a situation attributable in no small part to Mr. Conway's leadership.
Before becoming union president, Mr. Conway made his name as a pugnacious but pragmatic negotiator, sitting down with management as partners in problem solving and not opponents. While prioritizing wages, jobs and benefits, he also understood that the long-term health of the industry was in everyone's interest.
In the late 1990s, as a result of the Asian economic downturn, millions of tons of cheap steel flooded into the United States, leading to a wave of steel-mill bankruptcies. Mr. Conway helped negotiate a series of corporate loans and consolidations, which helped stabilize the industry and ensure its growth.
"He was very keen on mastering and being able to help shape the future rather than being shaped by the decisions that others were making," Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a trade organization, said in a phone interview.
United Steelworkers has long been among the most progressive industrial unions, going back to its lobbying efforts in support of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Mr. Conway continued that tradition, telling his members at the union's 2022 convention that their future lay in building a more diverse and inclusive work force.
"Corporations try to exploit our differences," he said. "But what they get instead is relentless, unwavering solidarity."
He was also a founding board member of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor groups and environmental organizations, and a strong advocate for the transition away from fossil fuels -- a transition that, he understood, would need new equipment provided by American manufacturing.
"He was not only a true rank-and-file union leader," Jason Walsh, the executive director of the alliance, said in a phone interview. "He was an environmental leader."
Even while many of his union's members voted for Donald J. Trump in the 2016 presidential election and again in 2020, Mr. Conway remained a steadfast supporter of the Democrats, endorsing Hillary Clinton for president in 2016 and Mr. Biden in 2020.
After the first Biden-Trump debate, in 2020, Mr. Conway accompanied Mr. Biden on a train trip to Pittsburgh from Cleveland, where the debate was held. Along the way, they discussed infrastructure and the need to invest both in high-profile, shovel-ready projects and long-term efforts that might not come to fruition for decades.
A year later he accompanied Marty Walsh, the secretary of labor. on a bus campaign to promote Mr. Biden's pandemic recovery efforts, including the CHIPS and Science Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act -- all of which, thanks in part to Mr. Conway's input, included significant investments in steel-friendly infrastructure.
"Tom was someone I confided in," Mr. Biden said in a statement after Mr. Conway's death. "He had my absolute trust. I knew that if I was doing a good job, he'd tell me -- and if I needed to do better, he'd tell me that, too."
Thomas Michael Conway was born on Feb. 14, 1952, in Newark. His parents were both union members -- his father, Thomas, worked for the operating engineers union, and his mother, Eleanor (Hadden) Conway, worked as a secretary for a trucking company and helped organize her office under the Teamsters.
His marriage to Linda Conway ended in divorce. In addition to his sons Justin and Philip, he is survived by his partner, Carol Murphy; another son, Tommy; and six grandchildren.
Mr. Conway spent four years in the Air Force as an aircraft mechanic, work that he continued after he left the service in 1974. Four years later, Bethlehem Steel recruited him to work as a millwright in the company's Burns Harbor coke plant in northwest Indiana. He soon became involved in the steelworkers union, joining Local 6787.
There he met David McCall, a fellow young union member. They realized that they shared the same birthday and many of the same interests. They rose through the union ranks together, with Mr. McCall replacing Mr. Conway as vice president in 2019. On Tuesday the Steelworkers announced that Mr. McCall would succeed him as president.
Mr. Conway's work as a union leader began almost immediately. When Bethlehem Steel tried to lay off workers during the economic downturn of the late 1970s, he helped his local push back, persuading the company to first cut nonunion contractors. In the end, no union members lost their jobs.
He moved from the local to the union's international staff in 1987, and in 2005 he became its vice president for administration. He also served as the secretary of the union's Basic Steel Industry Conference, which designed negotiating strategies and set policy agendas for local and state lobbying efforts.
Mr. Conway saw the Biden administration's infrastructure agenda as the culmination of decades of efforts on the part of unions like his to reinvigorate American manufacturing through large-scale public investment.
Even before the president signed the legislation, Mr. Conway was working the phones for his locals, lining up companies behind potential projects. Among other things, he arranged for US Wind, a renewable energy company, to manufacture turbines at a former Bethlehem Steel plant near Baltimore, creating 500 jobs.
"Tom Conway helped build unions all across the country," the president said in his statement. "He made our nation fairer. He made our nation stronger. And I will miss him dearly."

A New Era of Prosperity for Greece: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: It is one of Europe's fastest-growing economies, and while investors and tourists are flocking to the country, memories of austerity measures are still fresh for Greeks.
Paris Skouros pointed toward the sky outside his office in Athens on a recent weekday. In the past six months, four high-rises had sprung up, built by Greek and international builders to be sold for use as tourist rentals, foreign real estate investments and company offices. Farther afield, a fresh crop of new buildings dotted the horizon.
Greece's financial crisis almost ruined his firm, Skouros & Sons, an elevator company. Years of harsh austerity measures imposed by international bailouts had been wrenching, Mr. Skouros said, as new construction ground to a standstill. But now an economic recovery has barreled in.
"During the crisis, we just wanted to survive," Mr. Skouros said, as the sound of hammers hitting sheet metal rang out in his workshop. "Now we're profitable, and business is so strong that we can't find enough workers to keep up with demand."
Laden with debt it couldn't pay back, Greece nearly broke the eurozone a decade ago. Today, it is one of Europe's fastest-growing economies. In a significant acknowledgment of the country's turnaround, credit ratings agencies have been upgrading their appraisal of Greece's debt, and opening the door for large foreign investors.
The economy is growing at twice the eurozone average, and unemployment, while still high at 11 percent, is the lowest in over a decade. Tourists have returned in droves, fueling a construction frenzy and new jobs. Multinational companies, like Microsoft and Pfizer, are investing. And banks that almost collapsed have cleaned up and are lending again, benefiting the broader economy.
Greece still faces risks. Its mountain of debt has shrunk, but at 166 percent of the economy, it's among the world's highest. The country's banks still hold a pile of nonperforming loans that is bigger than the European average. And the misery of austerity is still fresh for some people, made worse by stubbornly high inflation stoked by Russia's war in Ukraine.
The country's prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, a business-friendly conservative politician, was re-elected by a landslide in June after being credited with spurring a recovery by reducing taxes and debt. The government cut red tape for businesses and raised the minimum wage. The country is even paying back international bailout money ahead of schedule.
Mr. Mitsotakis hailed Greece's return to investors' graces. "I will never allow us to relive the trauma of a national bankruptcy," he said a day after the latest upgrade.
Greece became the center of Europe's debt crisis after Wall Street imploded in 2008. Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus were also forced to take international bailouts. But Greece had it the worst, requiring three rescue packages from 2010 to 2015, totaling 320 billion euros, or $ 343 billion, with bitter austerity terms. Household incomes and pensions were slashed. The economy shrank by a quarter, and hundreds of thousands of businesses collapsed as banks shuttered. By 2013, nearly a third of Greeks were unemployed.
"We would have liked the austerity to be milder, but the measures were the Greek contribution to saving itself," said Yannis Stournaras, a former finance minister who is the governor of Greece's central bank and a member of the European Central Bank board. "Greece had to take these tough steps to survive."
Greece exited the bailout programs' strict fiscal controls in 2018, and the government's actions since then have earned confidence from the European Union. In 2021, Brussels policymakers approved another €30 billion for climate investments in Greece, part of a broader effort to bolster E.U. economies after Covid-19 lockdowns.
This month, DBRS Morningstar, a global credit rating agency recognized by the European Central Bank, raised Greece's debt rating to investment grade, a move that opens the door for pensions and other big investors to buy bonds issued by the government. And that will lower borrowing costs for households, businesses and the government after the E.C.B. has been raising interest rates to fight inflation.
Moody's, one of the largest credit ratings agencies, raised Greece's debt rating on Sept. 15 by two notches, just short of investment grade, citing "profound structural change" in the country's economy, finances and banking system.
Investors are jumping in. Microsoft is building a €1 billion data center east of Athens. Farther north, Pfizer is anchoring a €650 million research hub. American, Chinese and European companies are pitching renewable-energy deals. And investments by Cisco, JPMorgan, Meta and other multinationals are projected to have an economic impact worth billions of euros over the next few years.
Well over 10 million tourists swarmed into Greece this summer despite a spate of wildfires, bringing estimated revenues of over €21 billion. Construction has climbed on the mainland and on popular Greek islands, driven by a surging demand for hotels, Airbnb rentals and a program that lets foreigners get a visa to live in E.U. states if they buy at least €500,000 in real estate in Greece.
The activity has buoyed businesses like the one run by Mr. Skouros. The company, which he manages with his brother, John, was founded by their father in 1965. When orders dried up during the economic crisis, they pulled through by servicing elevators they had already installed around Athens.
Today, it has orders for elevators in 10 buildings, up from none during the crisis and Covid lockdowns. At around €20,000 per elevator, the firm is profitable again. Mr. Skouros raised salaries 10 percent and hired five more employees. He needs more technicians, but in a hot economy, he is no longer finding takers.
The comeback is moving so quickly that Mr. Skouros is worried about a real estate bubble forming. So he is steering clear of new high-rise construction that he fears could go bust, and targeting smaller residential buildings with sound finances.
For others, the economic upturn has yet to heal the scars from austerity.
Dmitris Mitrofinakis, 67, has struggled to bounce back from shuttering the home décor store that he ran for over 40 years, after draining his personal savings during the crisis to try to salvage it. When he retired in 2015, the pension that he had long paid into was slashed to €1,300 a month from the €2,400 he was supposed to get.
"The austerity imposed on Greece was too strict," said Mr. Mitrofinakis, who lives in a modest apartment with his wife in a working-class neighborhood, adding that he has little money left at the end of the month.
He sees signs that the economy is improving. "When you look around, people have more work and higher salaries," Mr. Mitrofinakis said. "But a lot of other people haven't recovered," he said, adding that many of his retired neighbors are struggling to make ends meet.
Roula Skouros, a hotel manager in the city of Tripoli, doesn't expect Greece's investment grade rating to improve her life. "Someone who maybe works at the bank or at the stock market probably is affected, but I'm not," said Ms. Skouros, who is not related to Paris Skouros.
Her paycheck has always hovered around the minimum wage, she said. But with inflation running rampant at the gas pump and grocery store, an improved economy "doesn't mean anything if you can't afford gas and food," Ms. Skouros said.
In a recent speech, Mr. Mitsotakis acknowledged the challenges and vowed to spread the recovery's benefits more widely. "We're not hiding behind investment grade, saying, 'We achieved an important goal -- let's turn to autopilot,"' he said.
His government announced that it aimed to raise the monthly minimum wage to €950 by the end of its four-year term after lifting it to €780 in April. Public-sector salaries will also increase for the first time since a 20 percent cut during the crisis to pay Greece's debts.
For Konstantinos Kanderakis, 62, a supervisor at Greece's digital services agency, the gains are meaningful. He earns €1,300 a month after a 35-year career in government, and he will get a €100 monthly increase after a decade in which his income had fallen.
"It's a big psychological boost," he said. "Greece is stable again, and what I am happy about is that things will be better for my children."

Full text: Highway travel centers are adding amenities like restaurants and dog parks to accommodate the expanded dwell time of electric vehicle owners.
Planning a long road trip? Now you can nibble on crudités and shop for home furnishings at a roadside service plaza while you wait for your electric vehicle to recharge.
The truck stops that keep Americans fueled, fed and refreshed along major highways are spending billions overhauling their stores to keep up with changing consumer behavior, particularly the growing popularity of electric vehicles.
Along with the addition of charging stations, these travel centers are being redesigned to accommodate longer stays, with renovated restrooms and showers, quick-serve kitchens, full-service and fast-food restaurants, and dog parks.
The changes continue to transform the modern truck stop, a slice of Americana that took off in the 1960s amid the expansion of the Interstate Highway System. Over the years, truck stops were often perceived as grimy -- and occasionally seedy. But today, they are more akin to a mini-Walmart, filled with energy drinks, iced coffee, and healthy snacks like sliced fruit and veggies. Across the aisle, you're likely to find purses and puzzles, as well as phone chargers and birdhouses.
The changes better position truck stops to serve the growing number of electric vehicles on the road, said Jim Hurless, a managing director in Dallas for CBRE, a real estate services firm.
"Truck stops are trying to get electric car owners to spend as much of that time as possible inside their stores," he said. "So they're trying to differentiate themselves by providing amenities that will be more appealing to that consumer."
The popularity of electric vehicles is surging; some 577,000 were sold in the United States in the first half of 2023, a 47 percent increase from a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive. But many owners are reluctant to take long trips for fear of not finding a charger when needed, a concern known as range anxiety, said Mr. Hurless, who manages the development and advancement of CBRE's electric vehicle business.
Exactly how the charging networks will come together remains unclear, say truck stop operators, who face numerous challenges, including growing demand, byzantine utility rules that differ from state to state and the need for sufficient power to operate fast chargers, which can provide up to 350 kilowatts versus the 1.8 to 22 kilowatts delivered by standard chargers.
Additionally, peak-demand charges from utilities pose potential surprises for operators, said Aaron Luque, chief executive of EnviroSpark, a designer and installer of electric car charging stations in Atlanta.
"Electric vehicle charging presents a unique set of challenges," he said. "But what's encouraging is that traditional fuel providers are coming around."
To foster development of a cross-country charging network along major highways, Congress in 2021 passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which included $ 5 billion to pay for up to 80 percent of the cost of installing fast chargers. Truck stop operators and others are petitioning states for the grants, which are targeting locations along major highway interchanges that are least 50 miles apart.
Pilot, a fuel provider and travel center operator based in Knoxville, Tenn., has so far secured $ 9.6 million from Ohio and $ 2.3 million from Pennsylvania in fast-charger funding for a total of 17 locations, said Brad Jenkins, president of PFJ Energy, Pilot's fuel supply division. The company also has teamed up with General Motors and EVgo, an owner and operator of fast-charging networks in the United States, to expand the infrastructure.
"This is such a new business that you're not only trying to figure out who will show up, but when will they show up -- will it be at a time of peak or low electrical demand?" Mr. Jenkins said. "We're working with regulators, utilities and states and others to come up with creative solutions to make this work."
Pilot, which operates more than 870 Pilot and Flying J locations in the United States and Canada, started a $ 1 billion initiative last year to remodel 400 of its travel centers and upgrade others over three years. The effort is Pilot's largest investment in store modernization since its founding in 1958.
"We take care of 1.5 million guests per day, and we realize they all have different tastes and that their needs are changing," said Allison Cornish, vice president of store modernization for Pilot. "We want to be a place for all travelers"
Pilot's two biggest competitors -- Love's Travel Stops and TravelCenters of America -- are also investing heavily in store overhauls.
Love's, a family-owned business in Oklahoma City that was founded in 1964, has built about half of its 640-store network over the last decade and is spending $ 1 billion to refresh its older stock, said Shane Wharton, president of the chain. In a few cases, that means razing and reconstructing stores. The company is opening 25 locations this year, and it has received $ 4.8 million in federal funding for electric vehicle charging stations at eight travel centers in Pennsylvania and Colorado.
"From a competitive standpoint, we want a consistency of customer experience," he said. "When our customers see the Love's brand, they'll know what to expect."
Truck stops are committed to adding fast electric vehicle chargers, which means travelers will need a place to hang out for around 30 minutes or longer while their cars charge, said Mr. Hurless, the CBRE executive.
But travel center operators hope to have perfected a pleasant dwell-time experience regardless of the car or truck their customers drive.
"If you're filling up with gas or diesel, it might take three to five minutes, but charging electric vehicles today might be 30 minutes," said Mr. Wharton, who expects to receive state grants soon. "By providing those products and services, whether it's food, Wi-Fi, a dog park or a shower, we think we're positioned well when compared to a charger in the middle of a parking lot of some big-box retailer."
The evolution of the travel center parallels trends in the convenience store industry, which has experienced a jump in traffic amid enhanced fresh food, baked goods and coffee options over the past few years. Foot traffic at convenience stores last year was 15.9 percent higher than it was in 2019, outpacing grocery stores, fast food chains, coffee chains, conventional gas stations and other related retail categories, according to Placer.ai, an analytics firm that tracks customer traffic.
The changes at truck stops are attracting investors. Early this year, Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway paid $ 8.2 billion to increase its ownership of Pilot to 80 percent from 38.6 percent. And the British energy giant BP completed its $ 1.3 billion acquisition of TravelCenters of America in May.
BP is investing $ 1 billion in electric vehicle chargers across its U.S. retail businesses, which include Amoco and Thorntons, said Greg Franks, BP's senior vice president of mobility and convenience for the Americas. The overhaul of travel centers along with the creation of an e-commerce platform is aimed, in part, at strengthening its appeal to passenger traffic, he added.
"We've been very clear that our ambition in the U.S. is to grow," Mr. Franks said.
Truck stops provide billions of gallons of fuel to the market each year, so the addition of electric vehicle chargers is a major transformation for the business. But like natural gas, hydrogen and other alternative fuels that travel centers offer, they're a new opportunity, said David Fialkov, executive vice president of government affairs at the National Association of Truck Stop Operators, a trade association.
"Truck stops don't care what type of fuel people put into their cars, just like they don't care whether people buy Coke or Pepsi or coffee or cake in their stores," he said. "But they need to be able to make money selling electricity in the same way they do selling gas to build an ongoing, sustainable market."

Making the Planet Glisten With Gold, While Poisoning It in the Process: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Jeovane de Jesus Aguiar was knee-deep in mud in the 100-yard gash he had cut into the Amazon rainforest, filtering brown water out of a pan, when he found the small, shiny flake he was looking for: a mixture of gold and mercury.
Mr. Aguiar had drizzled liquid mercury into the ground in his makeshift gold mine on the eastern edge of the small South American nation of Suriname, just as he had every few days.
The toxic element mixes with gold dust and forms an amalgam he can pluck out of the sludge. Then he sets the mixture aflame, burning off the mercury into the air, where winds spread it across the forest and across borders, poisoning the plants, animals and people it finds.
Left behind is the gold. That part usually ends up in Europe, the United States and the Persian Gulf, most often as expensive jewelry.
Twenty minutes along the river, the Wayana Indigenous community is getting sick. The Wayana eat fish from the river every day and, in recent years, many have been suffering from joint pain, muscle weakness and swelling. They also say birth defects are rising.
Tests show that the Wayana have double to triple the medically acceptable levels of mercury in their blood. "We're not allowed to eat certain fish anymore," said Linia Opoya in June, showing her hands, which ache after meals. "But there's nothing else. That's what we've always eaten."
Driven by global scientific consensus that mercury causes brain damage, severe illnesses and birth defects, most of the world's countries signed a groundbreaking international treaty in 2013 committing themselves to eradicating its use globally.
Yet 10 years later, mercury remains a scourge.
It has seriously harmed thousands of children in Indonesia. It has contaminated rivers throughout the Amazon, creating a humanitarian crisis for Brazil's largest isolated tribe. And worldwide, doctors still warn against eating too much of certain fish because the toxic metal floats into the ocean and is absorbed into the food chain.
Suriname, a forested nation of 620,000 people on the northern edge of South America, is a case study in how mercury has become so intractable in large part because of society's insatiable appetite for gold.
For decades, mercury has poisoned much of Suriname's population. Nearly one in five births results in complications such as death, low birth weight or disabilities, according to one study, twice the rate of the United States. Yet mercury has also fueled the nation's economy; gold accounts for 85 percent of Suriname's exports, most of it mined with mercury.
"I could work without mercury," said Mr. Aguiar, 51, overlooking his open pit. "But it wouldn't be profitable."
Suriname has banned mercury, yet the substance is easily smuggled in and widely used.
The Surinamese government did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
While Western countries, including the United States, have largely phased out mercury, more than 10 million people in 70 countries -- mostly poorer nations across Asia, Africa and Latin America -- still use the toxic element to extract gold from the ground, according to the United Nations.
These small-scale miners produce a fifth of the world's gold -- and nearly two-fifths of the world's mercury pollution, according to the United Nations and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Mining is the leading source of mercury emissions, ahead of coal-fired power plants.
"This is the brutal face of poverty," said Achim Steiner, chief of the U.N. Development Program. For many miners, "the fact that mercury might harm me in 10 years' time is too far from the reality of survival," he added.
Large-scale gold miners use centrifuge machines or cyanide, which does not seep into the environment. Small miners choose mercury because it is cheap, easy to use and still available.
"Mercury, for better or worse, is a very simple technology, used for the better part of 2,000 years," said Luis Fernandez, a Wake Forest University professor who has studied small-scale gold mining. "You can learn how to be a miner in 15 minutes, and you get pretty good results."
While many countries have banned mercury in mining, enforcement is lax, Mr. Fernandez said. Gold mining "is an economic pressure valve for poorer countries," he said. And that has only been compounded by the 12 percent rise in gold prices over the past year, to nearly $ 2,000 an ounce.
In 2013, the international community signed a broad treaty to take mercury off the market. It was called the Minamata Convention, named for a Japanese city where decades of industrial mercury pollution caused neurological diseases in more than 2,200 residents and even poisoned the city's cats, causing them to jump into the sea.
Under the convention -- which 145 nations, including Suriname, have now ratified -- countries pledged to ban new mercury mines, close existing ones and, with some exceptions, halt the import and export of mercury.
The United States and European Union have since banned virtually all mercury exports, leaving the United Arab Emirates, Tajikistan, Russia, Mexico and Nigeria as some of the largest exporters. Researchers believe that China, which adopted the treaty, remains the world's largest user of mercury.
The Minamata Convention, however, did not target small-scale gold mining. "Evidence has shown time and again that if you ban something that people need and there is no alternative, you simply drive them into illegality," Mr. Steiner said.
Where Mr. Aguiar lives along the Maroni River, which forms the boundary between Suriname and French Guiana, everyone is either a miner or works for one. About 15 percent of Suriname's work force, or 18,000 people, is connected to the gold mining industry, one of the highest percentages in the world, according to studies by the Free University of Amsterdam.
At the mines, workers shoot pressurized water to wash away generations of sediment, cutting into the landscape and exposing the layer they hope contains gold. Then they throw mercury into the water so it will bind naturally with any gold below.
The mercury is not hard to come by -- and experts believe that much of it arrives from China.
A few hours before Mr. Aguiar was tossing mercury into his mine, where he employs seven people, he docked his canoe at one of the dozens of Chinese merchants on the banks of the Maroni. The shops sell the same goods: Coca-Cola, instant noodles, condoms and mercury. Mr. Aguiar bought a kilogram in an unmarked prescription drug bottle for $ 250. If he is lucky, it will be enough to mine a half-kilogram of gold, which he can sell for roughly $ 25,000.
Elsewhere in Suriname, vendors posted listings on Facebook and cabdrivers offered mercury connections. People across the country said mercury sellers were overwhelmingly Chinese, and interactions with several Chinese sellers revealed that they had little concern that they were doing anything illegal; mercury was a product like any other.
The Organization of American States said this year that mercury in Suriname was probably "imported from China on container ships bringing in other goods, such as mining equipment."
In South America, researchers believe, only Bolivia imports mercury legally.
"So the question is: Where does it come from?" President Chandrikapersad Santokhi of Suriname told reporters in May. "We know it's smuggled."
Dr. Wilco Zijlmans, a pediatrician in Suriname who has studied the health effects of mercury, said its impact was clear. In a 2020 study of 1,200 Surinamese women that he helped conduct, 97 percent had unsafe levels of mercury in their bodies.
In addition to the elevated rate of birth complications, Dr. Zijlmans also found that children in Suriname were far more likely today than a generation ago to have delayed brain development, decreased motor skills and worse language and social abilities.
The effects are also showing up across the border. The Wayana Indigenous community has about 1,000 members spread across Suriname and French Guiana, which is French territory. Those in French Guiana have French citizenship, and French doctors have tracked the spread of mercury in some of their villages, which are surrounded by more than two dozen gold mines.
"Eventually, this will become like Minamata, too," said Ms. Opoya, the Wayana member, who lives in one of the villages on French territory.
Upriver, when Mr. Aguiar wants to cash in, he takes his haul to the Chinese merchants who sell him the mercury. Those merchants then head to the hundreds of small gold-buying shops dotted across Paramaribo, Suriname's capital.
At one shop, the owner, Arnaldo Ribeiro, said he buys just about all the gold that comes through his doors but has little idea where it comes from or whether it has been mined with mercury.
He then resells it to Kaloti Minthouse, a joint venture between the Surinamese government and a gold importer based in the United Arab Emirates.
"We don't have to prove provenance," Mr. Ribeiro said of the gold he sells.
Kaloti Minthouse then legally exports the gold around the world.
That means gold like Mr. Aguiar's, cleaned of its mercury residue, is shipped off to become bank bullion, a necklace or perhaps a wedding ring, all its documents in order.

Full text: The accessory harks back to the embroidery that has become synonymous with the fashion house.
On a trip to Monte Carlo in 1923, the French couturier Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel was introduced to Hugh Grosvenor, the second Duke of Westminster, with whom she began a decade-long love affair. The couple would go hunting and fishing at his 100,000-acre Reay Forest estate in the Scottish Highlands, where, on blustery days, the designer often borrowed the duke's tweed blazers. Eventually, she enlisted the Scottish mill Linton Tweeds to produce her own yardage and, having famously cast aside delicate crepes and muslins, she presented her first cardigan made from the nubby fabric. "I asked wholesalers for natural colors," she would later recall to the French novelist Paul Morand. "I wanted women to be guided by nature." Chanel's bouclé tweeds and tartan ensembles, which were made in monochrome as well as pastel palettes, became synonymous with her refined, ever-so-slightly rugged style.
Now, three years after releasing the first Tweed de Chanel high jewelry collection, the historic fashion house has created 63 new pieces inspired by five of its recurring icons: spools of white ribbon, camellias (the designer's favorite flower), comets, lions and the sun. One of the standouts is the Tweed Poudré, a brooch that can transform into a necklace when worn on a chain. At its center is a brilliant-cut diamond, encircled by an array of powder pink sapphires set against rose gold openwork that mimics the embroidery of tweed, as well as the shape of the camellia. Complex and daring, just like the woman who started it all.

Making the Planet Glisten With Gold, While Poisoning It in the Process: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Jeovane de Jesus Aguiar was knee-deep in mud in the 100-yard gash he had cut into the Amazon rainforest, filtering brown water out of a pan, when he found the small, shiny flake he was looking for: a mixture of gold and mercury.
Mr. Aguiar had drizzled liquid mercury into the ground in his makeshift gold mine on the eastern edge of the small South American nation of Suriname, just as he had every few days.
The toxic element mixes with gold dust and forms an amalgam he can pluck out of the sludge. Then he sets the mixture aflame, burning off the mercury into the air, where winds spread it across the forest and across borders, poisoning the plants, animals and people it finds.
Left behind is the gold. That part usually ends up in Europe, the United States and the Persian Gulf, most often as expensive jewelry.
Twenty minutes along the river, the Wayana Indigenous community is getting sick. The Wayana eat fish from the river every day and, in recent years, many have been suffering from joint pain, muscle weakness and swelling. They also say birth defects are rising.
Tests show that the Wayana have double to triple the medically acceptable levels of mercury in their blood. "We're not allowed to eat certain fish anymore," said Linia Opoya in June, showing her hands, which ache after meals. "But there's nothing else. That's what we've always eaten."
Driven by global scientific consensus that mercury causes brain damage, severe illnesses and birth defects, most of the world's countries signed a groundbreaking international treaty in 2013 committing themselves to eradicating its use globally.
Yet 10 years later, mercury remains a scourge.
It has seriously harmed thousands of children in Indonesia. It has contaminated rivers throughout the Amazon, creating a humanitarian crisis for Brazil's largest isolated tribe. And worldwide, doctors still warn against eating too much of certain fish because the toxic metal floats into the ocean and is absorbed into the food chain.
Suriname, a forested nation of 620,000 people on the northern edge of South America, is a case study in how mercury has become so intractable in large part because of society's insatiable appetite for gold.
For decades, mercury has poisoned much of Suriname's population. Nearly one in five births results in complications such as death, low birth weight or disabilities, according to one study, twice the rate of the United States. Yet mercury has also fueled the nation's economy; gold accounts for 85 percent of Suriname's exports, most of it mined with mercury.
"I could work without mercury," said Mr. Aguiar, 51, overlooking his open pit. "But it wouldn't be profitable."
Suriname has banned mercury, yet the substance is easily smuggled in and widely used.
The Surinamese government did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
While Western countries, including the United States, have largely phased out mercury, more than 10 million people in 70 countries -- mostly poorer nations across Asia, Africa and Latin America -- still use the toxic element to extract gold from the ground, according to the United Nations.
These small-scale miners produce a fifth of the world's gold -- and nearly two-fifths of the world's mercury pollution, according to the United Nations and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Mining is the leading source of mercury emissions, ahead of coal-fired power plants.
"This is the brutal face of poverty," said Achim Steiner, chief of the U.N. Development Program. For many miners, "the fact that mercury might harm me in 10 years' time is too far from the reality of survival," he added.
Large-scale gold miners use centrifuge machines or arsenic, which does not seep into the environment. Small miners choose mercury because it is cheap, easy to use and still available.
"Mercury, for better or worse, is a very simple technology, used for the better part of 2,000 years," said Luis Fernandez, a Wake Forest University professor who has studied small-scale gold mining. "You can learn how to be a miner in 15 minutes, and you get pretty good results."
While many countries have banned mercury in mining, enforcement is lax, Mr. Fernandez said. Gold mining "is an economic pressure valve for poorer countries," he said. And that has only been compounded by the 12 percent rise in gold prices over the past year, to nearly $ 2,000 an ounce.
In 2013, the international community signed a broad treaty to take mercury off the market. It was called the Minamata Convention, named for a Japanese city where decades of industrial mercury pollution caused neurological diseases in more than 2,200 residents and even poisoned the city's cats, causing them to jump into the sea.
Under the convention -- which 145 nations, including Suriname, have now ratified -- countries pledged to ban new mercury mines, close existing ones and, with some exceptions, halt the import and export of mercury.
The United States and European Union have since banned virtually all mercury exports, leaving the United Arab Emirates, Tajikistan, Russia, Mexico and Nigeria as some of the largest exporters. Researchers believe that China, which adopted the treaty, remains the world's largest user of mercury.
The Minamata Convention, however, did not target small-scale gold mining. "Evidence has shown time and again that if you ban something that people need and there is no alternative, you simply drive them into illegality," Mr. Steiner said.
Where Mr. Aguiar lives along the Maroni River, which forms the boundary between Suriname and French Guiana, everyone is either a miner or works for one. About 15 percent of Suriname's work force, or 18,000 people, is connected to the gold mining industry, one of the highest percentages in the world, according to studies by the Free University of Amsterdam.
At the mines, workers shoot pressurized water to wash away generations of sediment, cutting into the landscape and exposing the layer they hope contains gold. Then they throw mercury into the water so it will bind naturally with any gold below.
The mercury is not hard to come by -- and experts believe that much of it arrives from China.
A few hours before Mr. Aguiar was tossing mercury into his mine, where he employs seven people, he docked his canoe at one of the dozens of Chinese merchants on the banks of the Maroni. The shops sell the same goods: Coca-Cola, instant noodles, condoms and mercury. Mr. Aguiar bought a kilogram in an unmarked prescription drug bottle for $ 250. If he is lucky, it will be enough to mine a half-kilogram of gold, which he can sell for roughly $ 25,000.
Elsewhere in Suriname, vendors posted listings on Facebook and cabdrivers offered mercury connections. People across the country said mercury sellers were overwhelmingly Chinese, and interactions with several Chinese sellers revealed that they had little concern that they were doing anything illegal; mercury was a product like any other.
The Organization of American States said this year that mercury in Suriname was probably "imported from China on container ships bringing in other goods, such as mining equipment."
In South America, researchers believe, only Bolivia imports mercury legally.
"So the question is: Where does it come from?" President Chandrikapersad Santokhi of Suriname told reporters in May. "We know it's smuggled."
Dr. Wilco Zijlmans, a pediatrician in Suriname who has studied the health effects of mercury, said its impact was clear. In a 2020 study of 1,200 Surinamese women that he helped conduct, 97 percent had unsafe levels of mercury in their bodies.
In addition to the elevated rate of birth complications, Dr. Zijlmans also found that children in Suriname were far more likely today than a generation ago to have delayed brain development, decreased motor skills and worse language and social abilities.
The effects are also showing up across the border. The Wayana Indigenous community has about 1,000 members spread across Suriname and French Guiana, which is French territory. Those in French Guiana have French citizenship, and French doctors have tracked the spread of mercury in some of their villages, which are surrounded by more than two dozen gold mines.
"Eventually, this will become like Minamata, too," said Ms. Opoya, the Wayana member, who lives in one of the villages on French territory.
Upriver, when Mr. Aguiar wants to cash in, he takes his haul to the Chinese merchants who sell him the mercury. Those merchants then head to the hundreds of small gold-buying shops dotted across Paramaribo, Suriname's capital.
At one shop, the owner, Arnaldo Ribeiro, said he buys just about all the gold that comes through his doors but has little idea where it comes from or whether it has been mined with mercury.
He then resells it to Kaloti Minthouse, a joint venture between the Surinamese government and a gold importer based in the United Arab Emirates.
"We don't have to prove provenance," Mr. Ribeiro said of the gold he sells.
Kaloti Minthouse then legally exports the gold around the world.
That means gold like Mr. Aguiar's, cleaned of its mercury residue, is shipped off to become bank bullion, a necklace or perhaps a wedding ring, all its documents in order.

Reversal in Britain Favors Microsoft-Activision Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Britain's antitrust regulator said the companies had addressed its main concerns about the $ 69 billion deal, though final approval is yet to come.
Microsoft came one step closer on Friday to completing its $ 69 billion purchase of the video game maker Activision Blizzard, in a deal that has become an example of how a company can successfully ride out stricter regulatory scrutiny of the power of tech giants.
Britain's Competition and Markets Authority, the last remaining agency that must sign off before Microsoft can complete the acquisition, said the companies had taken action that "substantially addresses" remaining antitrust concerns. The regulator initially tried to block the deal, saying it would undercut competition, but reversed course after Microsoft agreed not to buy a part of Activision's business associated with so-called cloud gaming, a small but promising new area for the industry.
First announced in January 2022, the acquisition has been heavily scrutinized by antitrust officials around the world and held up as a test of whether regulators would approve a tech megamerger amid concerns about the industry's power. The deal would upend the video game market, combining Microsoft's Xbox business with Activision, a publisher of such hit video games as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft.
But Microsoft, with experience in thorny antitrust disputes going back to the 1990s, was able to navigate its way through stiff regulatory resistance on both sides of the Atlantic. In July, the company won a court battle against the Federal Trade Commission, which had tried to block the deal. The European Union, typically an aggressive regulator of American tech firms, cleared the deal in May.
"Microsoft was very strategic in its approach in how it played the whole process from beginning to end," said Ioannis Kokkoris, professor of competition law and economics at Queen Mary, University of London.
He said that it was incredibly rare for Britain's C.M.A. to reverse course and that the agency had faced a lot of pressure to approve the deal after it cleared hurdles in other jurisdictions.
"When you are the last man standing, you cannot realistically block a deal when the U.K. represents less that 5 percent of the global revenues," said Tommaso Valletti, a professor of economics at Imperial College Business School who used to work on antitrust cases for the European Commission.
On Friday, British regulators said Microsoft had satisfied their concerns. The C.M.A. initially blocked the deal because, it said, a merger between the maker of a top-selling console with the publisher of hit games threatened to stunt the development of the emerging area of cloud gaming technology. Although still a very small market, the technology allows people to stream games on phones, tablets and other devices, diminishing the need for traditional consoles.
Microsoft agreed to transfer the cloud streaming licensing rights for all current and new Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft Entertainment, a rival game publisher. The arrangement lasts for 15 years, a move seen as preventing Microsoft from releasing Activision games exclusively on its own streaming service.
"The C.M.A. considers that the restructured deal makes important changes that substantially address the concerns it set out in relation to the original transaction earlier this year," the agency said in a statement on Friday.
The regulator said it was now holding a "consultation" through Oct. 6 about the remedies Microsoft had proposed before making a final decision on whether to approve the deal.
"We are encouraged by this positive development in the C.M.A.'s review process," Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said in a statement. "We look forward to working with Microsoft toward completing the regulatory review process," Activision Blizzard said in a statement.
The companies have said they intend to close the deal by Oct. 18.
Government scrutiny of the tech industry's growing power shows no signs of slowing down. This month, a trial began over claims by the U.S. Justice Department and a group of states that Google abused its power in the online search market. On Friday, E.U. regulators said they would reimpose a $ 400 million fine against Intel for abusing its power in the market for semiconductors. E.U. authorities are also investigating Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft for other anticompetitive business practices.
Mr. Kokkoris said Microsoft's mix of fighting in court and offering business concessions provided a playbook for other tech companies to follow when making large acquisitions.
"This is definitely going to make Big Tech more willing to continue deal making, but the companies know now that they will have to give up something more than they thought before this case," he said.
This week, Cisco agreed to buy the cybersecurity company Splunk for $ 28 billion. Broadcom, the semiconductor giant, is also getting closer to completing an acquisition of the software company VMware for $ 61 billion.

Full text: The largest deal Cisco has ever announced moves it further away from its roots in network hardware and into higher-margin software subscriptions.
Cisco agreed on Thursday to buy Splunk, a data-analysis software company, for $ 28 billion in cash, as technology giants continue to look to acquisitions as a way to grow -- particularly in hot sectors like artificial intelligence.
The deal is the largest ever announced by Cisco, a longtime buyer of smaller tech companies, and suggests the company is willing to test antitrust officials' growing opposition to big-ticket mergers and acquisitions.
Founded in 2003, Splunk -- whose name refers to spelunking, or cave exploration -- focuses on mining its customers' data for insights, particularly on security vulnerabilities and other trends in their business. This summer, Splunk announced a flurry of A.I.-infused services meant to help companies detect and respond to potential issues more quickly.
Cisco said it planned to combine Splunk's capabilities with its own security offerings, including the monitoring of customers' network data, web traffic and emails.
"I consistently heard from our customers the strategic importance of what Splunk does," Chuck Robbins, the Cisco chief executive, said in an interview. Combining Splunk's systems with the information collected from Cisco's, he said, presented an "opportunity to bring a level of insight that's unmatched."
Gary Steele, the Splunk chief executive, added that Cisco's bigger sales footprint would help his company sell its products more widely, especially internationally. Mr. Steele is set to stay on as a member of Cisco's leadership team when the transaction closes, which is expected by the fall of next year.
The deal moves Cisco further away from its roots in network hardware and into higher-margin, more predictable software subscriptions.
Much of Cisco's push into software is being driven by acquisitions: The company has announced eight takeovers this year, according to S&P Capital IQ.
By some measures, Cisco is paying a high price. The transaction valued Splunk at $ 157 a share, a 31 percent premium to where its stock closed on Wednesday and 25 percent above the company's 52-week high. (Cisco had held discussions to buy Splunk early last year.)
Shares in Cisco fell 4 percent after the deal was announced. Shares in Splunk rose on the news, but still traded below the acquisition offer price, suggesting investors were somewhat skeptical that the deal would be completed. Among the potential concerns is whether antitrust regulators will approve the transaction, given increased scrutiny of big mergers by the Biden administration.
Privately, corporate executives have said recent setbacks for regulators, including defeats for the Federal Trade Commission's effort to block Microsoft's $ 70 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard, could make it easier to do deals.
Mr. Robbins expressed confidence in the Cisco-Splunk deal's clearing antitrust hurdles, because there is little overlap in the companies' products.

With Interest Rates High, Wall Street Continues to Fall: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/with-interest-rates-high-wall-street-continues/docview/2867005607/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street fell sharply Thursday in an ugly day for stocks worldwide on expectations that U.S. interest rates will stay high well into next year.
The S&P 500 lost 1.6 percent for its worst day since March. That followed a drop of 0.9 percent from Wednesday after the Federal Reserve indicated it may cut interest rates next year by just half of what it had earlier predicted. The Fed has already raised its main interest rate to levels unseen since 2001, which helps slow inflation, but at the cost of hurting investment prices.
High-growth stocks are typically among the hardest hit by high rates, and Big Tech stocks took the brunt of the pain for a second straight day. The Nasdaq composite dropped 1.8 percent as Amazon fell 4.4 percent, Nvidia dropped 2.9 percent and Telsa lost 2.6 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.1 percent.
Stock prices tend to fall when rates rise because stocks are riskier investments. Why stomach the chance of their big swings when Treasurys are paying more in interest than before? And they're paying much more.
A 10-year Treasury is offering a yield of 4.48 percent, up from 4.40 percent late Wednesday and from only 0.50 percent three years ago. It's near its highest level since 2007.
The two-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, wavered after some mixed reports on the economy. It slipped to 5.14 percent from 5.17 percent late Wednesday after climbing earlier in the morning.
One report showed fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected. It was the lowest number since January and the latest signal of a remarkably resilient job market.
Such a solid labor market helps calm worries about a possible recession. But it may also give U.S. households fuel to keep spending, which could encourage companies to try to raise prices further and keep upward pressure on inflation. That in turn could give the Fed more reason to keep rates higher for longer.
A separate report, meanwhile, suggested manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region is contracting by much more than economists expected. A third report showed sales of previously occupied U.S. homes were weaker last month than economists expected.
Manufacturing and the housing industry have felt the sting of higher interest rates in particular and have struggled more than the broad job market.
Interest rates may stay high if the Federal Reserve follows through on the latest forecasts from its policymaking officials.
Policymakers have indicated they could raise the federal funds rate one more time this year, then cut it by only half a percentage point from there through 2024. Three months ago, Fed officials were forecasting a full percentage point of cuts could be the most likely path. They want to ensure that inflation gets back down to the Fed's target of 2 percent.
Wednesday's projections may be an indication that "raises the bar for rate cuts next year," according to the Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle. He pushed out his forecast for the first cut in interest rates to the final three months of 2024 after earlier thinking it could happen during the spring.
High rates slow the economy by design and raise the pressure across the financial world. Earlier this spring, they helped lead to three high-profile collapses of U.S. banks. They also hurt prices for all kinds of investments. The hardest hit tend to be those bid up on hopes for big growth far out in the future. That's why tech stocks often swing in particular with expectations for rates.
Cisco Systems also took a hit after it said it would buy Splunk, a cybersecurity company, for roughly $ 28 billion in cash. Cisco fell 3.9%, while Splunk jumped 20.8%.
On the winning side of Wall Street, FedEx rose 4.5% after it reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

Charles Gayle, Whose Saxophone Wailed Like a Preacher, Dies at 84: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An intense and uncompromising player, he made music that one critic said was more about "motion and spirit" than tonal centers, rhythms and melodies.
Charles Gayle, an uncompromising saxophonist who spent years living and performing on the streets of New York before beginning a recording career when he was nearly 50, died on Sept. 5 in Brooklyn. He was 84.
His son Ekwambu, who had been caring for him as he dealt with Alzheimer's disease, announced the death but did not specify a cause.
Mr. Gayle said he had chosen to be homeless because it gave him the opportunity to explore music unencumbered by worries about changing tastes or living expenses. He was part of an ecstatic lineage of jazz avant-gardists like late-period John Coltrane and Albert Ayler, purveyors of a style often referred to as "fire music."
Mr. Gayle's playing was eventually documented on nearly 40 albums under his name on a host of labels; he also recorded with the pianist Cecil Taylor, the bassist William Parker and the punk singer Henry Rollins.
Reviewing the 2014 Vision Festival, at which Mr. Gayle was given a lifetime achievement award, the New York Times music critic Ben Ratliff wrote, "He plays tenor saxophone in cries and gabbles and interval jumps and long tones; his music usually describes motion and spirit rather than corresponding to preset tonal centers, rhythms and melodies."
An ardent Christian, Mr. Gayle did not only channel his intense spirituality into his sound; it was also reflected in the titles of many of his albums, and in the screeds he delivered extemporaneously during his performances.
Mr. Gayle also had an alternate musical persona called Streets: He would dress in a torn suit and clown shoes and wear makeup and a red nose. At first it was an occasional diversion, but he later performed as Streets regularly. In a 2014 interview with The New York City Jazz Record, he explained:
"It wasn't a gimmick or anything like that. I looked at myself one day in the mirror and said to myself, 'Stop thinking about Charles.' So I put a rubber nose on and said 'That'll work.'
"It was really that simple," he continued. "I saw a lot of clowns when I was young in the circus, but it was so liberating to go out in an audience while the band is playing and give a lady a rose or get rejected by her and everything -- I can't do that with regular clothes on. It helps a person mentally to escape -- there's a purpose in the escape, and it is the same thing as being in the music and trying to get past certain things. In order for me to do that I had to disappear."
Charles Ennis Gayle Jr. was born on Feb. 28, 1939, in Buffalo, N.Y., to Charles and Frances Gayle. His father was a steelworker. He studied numerous instruments in high school and excelled in basketball and track and field.
After a period at Fredonia State Teachers College, Mr. Gayle returned to Buffalo to begin his music career. He first played trumpet and piano in local clubs before concentrating more on tenor saxophone in self-produced concerts, while also working at a Westinghouse factory and later at a bank providing loans for Black-owned businesses.
From 1970 to 1973, Mr. Gayle was an assistant professor of music at the State University of New York at Buffalo (now the University at Buffalo). But, tiring of institutional responsibilities, he left academia and moved to New York City to pursue music exclusively. He had been there for almost a decade when he decided to live on the streets.
In the 2014 interview, he recalled: "I just walked out one day and that was it. That was one of the greatest experiences I had in my life, though I didn't do it for that reason. You have nothing and you're not asking anybody for anything. We seek security, and you learn about how people perceive you because of what you look like or what they think you're about."
He had music ready for release by ESP-Disk, Mr. Ayler's label from 1964 to 1966, but those plans were scuttled when the company went out of business in 1975. (That session has yet to be heard, but the label was revived in 2005 and released a 1994 performance by Mr. Gayle's trio in 2012.)
Mr. Gayle spent more than 15 years homeless, performing on the streets of New York. Then, in 1987, he began his second act.
After the promoter Michael Dorf heard Mr. Gayle play, he was booked regularly at Mr. Dorf's Lower Manhattan club, the Knitting Factory. Music he recorded at sessions in April 1988 became three albums for the Swedish label Silkheart Records. From 1991 onward, Mr. Gayle would steadily release albums under his own name -- some as the leader of a trio or quartet, others as a solo performer -- among them "Repent," "Consecration," "Testaments," "Daily Bread" and "Christ Everlasting."
In a 2013 interview with Cadence magazine, he reflected on the perils of being outspoken about his religious beliefs, which included rants against homosexuality and abortion that he delivered at his concerts with the fervor of a country preacher:
"People have told me to shut up and stuff. I understand that I can turn people off with what I say or do. The problem that people have with me is not me, it's Christ they have a problem with. I understand that when you start speaking about faith or religion, they want you to keep it in a box, but I'm not going to do that. Not because I'm taking advantage of being a musician; I'm the same everywhere, and people have to understand that."
Mr. Gayle also had a notable collaborative group with Mr. Parker and the drummer Rashied Ali and was a guest on two albums by Henry Rollins. In addition to tenor saxophone, he played alto and soprano saxophones, piano, viola, upright bass and drums. He is seen and heard in an interview and playing with the German bassist Peter Kowald's trio in a 1985 documentary, "Rising Tones Cross," produced and directed by his former wife Ebba Jahn.
A biography of Mr. Gayle by Cisco Bradley, with all proceeds going to the Gayle family, is scheduled for publication in late 2024.
Mr. Gayle's three marriages all ended in divorce. In addition to his son Ekwambu, from his second marriage, his survivors include two other sons, Michael, from the first, and Dwayne, from his marriage to Ms. Jahn; and a granddaughter.
The drummer Michael Wimberley, who worked with Mr. Gayle from the early 1990s well into the new millennium, called him "a father, mentor and friend whom I had the pleasure of creating some of the most adventurous improvised sounds, shapes and musical dialogues with."
"Charles's intensity on the horn," he added, "was so powerful in person. I had never experienced anything like music of that intensity before! He pulled me into the sonic center of his sound and raptured me."

Ukraine Still Hosts Hasidim's Party of the Year: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Yosef Chaim Bernfeld, a young businessman from New York who is trying to straighten out his life, journeyed to Uman this weekend for a "spiritual fix."
Every Jewish New Year, even this one during a raging war, thousands of Hasidic pilgrims turn this city in central Ukraine into a mini Jerusalem.
They roam around in big groups sucking down Coke Zero and kosher pizza, paying in shekels. They pump out Hebrew hip-hop and dance hard together in the middle of the street.
They exchange blessings -- "I ask God to give you a sense of belonging, to give you stability, to grow your business this year" -- and drink copious amounts of red wine way past the wartime curfew.
Mr. Bernfeld, a sturdy 33-year-old who said he has struggled with his faith and substance abuse, has joined this gathering 11 times. But this year he was clean, and his verdict was, "It's different, maybe not quite as fun."
But then his face lit up. "No man," he said, "it's amazing. It's like a reset."
This year, even Europe's biggest war in generations and extensive travel warnings could not stop the pilgrimage. More than 35,000 people, nearly all of them men and boys, showed up over the weekend, upending stereotypes of Hasidic Jews who often cut an austere image with their black hats and long black coats. Many of the Hasidim who came to Uman came to party.
But Uman serves as a testament to something even deeper. Once a year, it becomes a thriving Jewish community in a place where Judaism was virtually wiped out.
The fact that one of the world's biggest Jewish New Year's celebrations unfolds in Ukraine, the site of some of the Holocaust's worst atrocities, and in Uman specifically, where the Nazis gunned down a thousand Jewish children and threw their bodies in a pit, illuminates a resilience quite apt for the moment. It is the High Holy Days, after all, a time for joy but also painful remembrance.
"It adds meaning," said Yitzy Gradman, another one of the many New Yorkers who flocked to Uman. "The biggest tribute I can give to the people who suffered here is to walk these streets today and say, 'We are proud of who we are, and we will never be extinguished."'
The Uman pilgrimage goes back more than 200 years. It is cemented on Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, who died in Uman in 1810 and was a great-grandson of the man widely considered the founder of Hasidic Judaism.
Rebbe Nachman was a deeply spiritual, charismatic figure in his own right. He encouraged people to show their happiness and commune directly with God, like a friend.
He asked his followers to be with him on Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, and before he died, he promised that if even the worst sinners would pray at his grave in Uman, which is near Breslov, and give a little to charity, he would do whatever he could to save them from hell.
While Jewish tradition contains a variety of interpretations of the afterlife, Rebbe Nachman's followers deeply believe in his power of salvation. Even during Soviet times, when organized religion was essentially shut down, Jews sneaked into Uman at the risk of being sent to the Gulag. After Ukraine gained independence in 1991 and religious freedom returned, the crowds at his graveside steadily grew.
The pilgrimage remains pious, but it is also wild. The Breslovers, as followers are called, are known for the exuberance with which they worship. Dozens have been arrested in Uman in past years for drug possession, drunkenness and brawling. This week, the Ukrainian police said that they confiscated illegal drugs from several pilgrims and planned to deport others for "aggressive behavior."
But Breslovers are also known for being open-minded. Men in black hats and sidelocks prayed next to men in tight T-shirts and tattoos. Most came from Israel, with the second biggest contingent from the United States.
Before the war, a few even choppered in from Kyiv, the capital, about 120 miles away.
But now that Ukraine's airspace is closed, most made overland trips from Poland, Moldova, Hungary or Romania that were long, exhausting and expensive.
"People put away all year for this," said Mr. Bernfeld, who goes by Bernie. "But it's beautiful. I don't think I've ever seen so much unity."
As a young man growing up in Rockland County, N.Y., Mr. Bernfeld said he chafed at the strictness of his Ultra-Orthodox community and turned to speed, cocaine and acid. It was not until he saw Rebbe Nachman's followers dancing ecstatically on YouTube that he realized "there's a fun Judaism, too."
"It helped me immensely," he said. "It might have even saved my life."
He recently moved to Israel, and on Friday night, he was kicking back with fellow Breslovers in a tent laid with a feast: plates of salmon and baked chicken, vegetable broth, salads, fried potatoes and hunks of freshly baked redolent challah that they dragged through bowls of thick Ukrainian honey.
The pilgrimage lasts about a week, and while there are some scheduled events, it is a lot of hanging out and breaking bread.
During the day, pilgrims circulate on Pushkina Street, the main drag in Uman's tiny Jewish neighborhood. They look for friends they have not seen since the last pilgrimage, visit rabbis for blessings, listen to motivational talks and squeeze into the small building housing Rebbe Nachman's grave. The smell of sweat, pizza grease and cigarette smoke hangs in the air.
At night, music blares from speakers and men throw their arms around each other and turn Pushkina Street into a dance floor. Later, they retreat to rented apartments to uncork beverages. Even after the midnight curfew, loud music -- and loud laughter -- wafts through open windows across town.
Locals are not sure what to think. Before the Holocaust, half of this city was Jewish. Today, out of 85,000 people, only a few hundred Jews are left. More than 2 million Jews once lived in Ukraine. Now it is around 200,000, perhaps less, though one of those, Volodymyr Zelensky, is president.
Mr. Zelensky didn't stop by Uman this week but a small contingent of Ukrainian Jews joined the festivities, which have fueled a bustling economy. Entire 10-story buildings are hired out, taxi drivers get dream fares and vendors do a mean trade in T-shirts, books, amulets and other Breslov merch.
Officials at city hall said the pilgrimage brings in more than $ 20 million a year, and businesspeople are clearly grateful. Still, some residents do not like it.
"There's disorder in our city because of all this," said one resident, Natalia Hordiyenko.
"I have nothing against them," she added. "They came here to celebrate their religious holiday. We understand all that."
But then Ms. Hordiyenko lit into the pilgrims for leaving behind "horrifying" amounts of litter and making unwanted advances on women, saying, "They misbehave."
Resident-pilgrim relations is a rich topic. Some pilgrims complained equally bitterly about the Ukrainians, accusing them of being cold and suspicious.
One of Mr. Bernfeld's friends proposed at the dinner table that Rebbe Nachman's grave should be excavated and flown to Israel. It sounds far-fetched, but the Israeli government has lobbied to do exactly that.
"It's an embarrassment we're even here," said Shlomo Ettlinger, an accountant, as he put down his glass of wine. "Why are we having this event in a town where Jews were massacred not once, not twice, but many times? Being here is like an abused person going back to their abuser."
Another man at the table laughed. "So, what are you saying, Shlomo?" he asked. "People don't like us? Tell me something new."
Mr. Bernfeld then stepped in, saying, "Shlomo, you know how much I respect your opinion."
He dragged another hunk of challah through the honey and chewed thoughtfully.
"But Rebbe Nachman said challenges are important, and it's a challenge getting here," Mr. Bernfeld said. "And more than that, I like this vibe. I don't want to change it."

They exchange blessings — “I ask God to give you a sense of belonging, to give you stability, to grow your business this year” — and drink copious amounts of red wine way past the wartime curfew.
Bernfeld, a sturdy 33-year-old who said he has struggled with his faith and substance abuse, has joined this gathering 11 times. But this year, he was clean, and his verdict was, “It’s different, maybe not quite as fun.”
But then his face lit up. “No man,” he said, “it’s amazing. It’s like a reset.”
This year, even Europe’s biggest war in generations and extensive travel warnings could not stop the pilgrimage. More than 35,000 people, nearly all of them men and boys, showed up over the weekend, upending stereotypes of Hasidic Jews who often cut an austere image with their black hats and long black coats. Many of the Hasidim who came to Uman came to party.
But Uman serves as a testament to something even deeper. Once a year, it becomes a thriving Jewish community in a place where Judaism was virtually wiped out.
The fact that one of the world’s biggest Jewish New Year’s celebrations unfolds in Ukraine, the site of some of the Holocaust’s worst atrocities, and in Uman specifically, where the Nazis gunned down a thousand Jewish children and threw their bodies in a pit, illuminates a resilience quite apt for the moment. It is the High Holy Days, after all, a time for joy but also painful remembrance.
“It adds meaning,” said Yitzy Gradman, another one of the many New Yorkers who flocked to Uman. “The biggest tribute I can give to the people who suffered here is to walk these streets today and say, ‘We are proud of who we are, and we will never be extinguished.’”
The Uman pilgrimage goes back more than 200 years. It is cemented on Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, who died in Uman in 1810 and was a great-grandson of the man widely considered the founder of Hasidic Judaism.
Nachman was a deeply spiritual, charismatic figure in his own right. He encouraged people to show their happiness and commune directly with God, like a friend.
He asked his followers to be with him on Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, and before he died, he promised that if even the worst sinners would pray at his grave in Uman, which is near Breslov, and give a little to charity, he would do whatever he could to save them from hell.
While Jewish tradition contains a variety of interpretations of the afterlife, Nachman’s followers deeply believe in his power of salvation. Even during Soviet times, when organized religion was essentially shut down, Jews sneaked into Uman at the risk of being sent to the Gulag. After Ukraine gained independence in 1991 and religious freedom returned, the crowds at his graveside steadily grew.
The pilgrimage remains pious, but it is also wild. The Breslovers, as followers are called, are known for the exuberance with which they worship. Dozens have been arrested in Uman in past years for drug possession, drunkenness and brawling. Last week, Ukrainian police said that they confiscated illegal drugs from several pilgrims and planned to deport others for “aggressive behavior.”
But Breslovers are also known for being open-minded. Men in black hats and sidelocks prayed next to men in tight T-shirts and tattoos. Most came from Israel, with the second-biggest contingent from the United States.
Before the war, a few even choppered in from Kyiv, the capital, about 120 miles away.
But now that Ukraine’s airspace is closed, most made overland trips from Poland, Moldova, Hungary or Romania that were long, exhausting and expensive.
“People put away all year for this,” said Bernfeld, who goes by Bernie. “But it’s beautiful. I don’t think I’ve ever seen so much unity.”
As a young man growing up in Rockland County, New York, Bernfeld said he chafed at the strictness of his Ultra-Orthodox community and turned to speed, cocaine and acid. It was not until he saw Nachman’s followers dancing ecstatically on YouTube that he realized “there’s a fun Judaism, too.”
“It helped me immensely,” he said. “It might have even saved my life.”
He recently moved to Israel, and Friday night, he was kicking back with fellow Breslovers in a tent laid with a feast: plates of salmon and baked chicken, vegetable broth, salads, fried potatoes and hunks of freshly baked redolent challah that they dragged through bowls of thick Ukrainian honey.
The pilgrimage lasts about a week, and while there are some scheduled events, it is a lot of hanging out and breaking bread.
During the day, pilgrims circulate on Pushkina Street, the main drag in Uman’s tiny Jewish neighborhood. They look for friends they have not seen since the last pilgrimage, visit rabbis for blessings, listen to motivational talks and squeeze into the small building housing Nachman’s grave. The smell of sweat, pizza grease and cigarette smoke hangs in the air.
At night, music blares from speakers, and men throw their arms around each other and turn Pushkina Street into a dance floor. Later, they retreat to rented apartments to uncork beverages. Even after the midnight curfew, loud music — and loud laughter — wafts through open windows across town.
Locals are not sure what to think. Before the Holocaust, half of this city was Jewish. Today, out of 85,000 people, only a few hundred Jews are left. More than 2 million Jews once lived in Ukraine. Now it is around 200,000, perhaps less, though one of those, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is president.
Zelenskyy didn’t stop by Uman last week, but a small contingent of Ukrainian Jews joined the festivities, which have fueled a bustling economy. Entire 10-story buildings are hired out, taxi drivers get dream fares, and vendors do a mean trade in T-shirts, books, amulets and other Breslov merch.
Officials at city hall said the pilgrimage brings in more than $20 million a year, and businesspeople are clearly grateful. Still, some residents do not like it.
“There’s disorder in our city because of all this,” said one resident, Natalia Hordiyenko.
“I have nothing against them,” she added. “They came here to celebrate their religious holiday. We understand all that.”
But then Hordiyenko lit into the pilgrims for leaving behind “horrifying” amounts of litter and making unwanted advances on women, saying, “They misbehave.”
Resident-pilgrim relations is a rich topic. Some pilgrims complained equally bitterly about the Ukrainians, accusing them of being cold and suspicious.
One of Bernfeld’s friends proposed at the dinner table that Nachman’s grave should be excavated and flown to Israel. It sounds far-fetched, but the Israeli government has lobbied to do exactly that.
“It’s an embarrassment we’re even here,” said Shlomo Ettlinger, an accountant, as he put down his glass of wine. “Why are we having this event in a town where Jews were massacred not once, not twice, but many times? Being here is like an abused person going back to their abuser.”
Another man at the table laughed. “So, what are you saying, Shlomo?” he asked. “People don’t like us? Tell me something new.”
Bernfeld then stepped in, saying, “Shlomo, you know how much I respect your opinion.”
He dragged another hunk of challah through the honey and chewed thoughtfully.
“But Rebbe Nachman said challenges are important, and it’s a challenge getting here,” Bernfeld said. “And more than that, I like this vibe. I don’t want to change it.”

Full text: Chart a 10-mile path down the Miami coast, and the options for luxury shopping are endless. But from Fendi to Missoni to Porsche to Bentley, the branded products many shoppers are buying aren't items you can take home. They are homes.
Branded real estate is surging: The market for name-brand luxury condominium units is projected to grow 12 percent each year between now and 2026, according to a report from the global real estate consultants, Knight Frank. Like blue jean makers and handbag designers, developers have long understood the power of a label, and today in nearly every major city, homeowners can shop residences from well-known hospitality brands like Four Seasons, Aman and Ritz-Carlton. Now more surprising brands are getting in on the trend, with purveyors of both luxury cars and couture looking to condos for their next frontier.
In Sunny Isles Beach, a sleepy, resort-heavy city within Miami-Dade County, the towers with boldfaced names include a Porsche Design Tower, Residences by Armani Casa and the forthcoming Bentley Residences, which by 2026 will stretch toward the sky with an exterior of recessed glass in Bentley's signature diamond-in-diamond quilted design, instantly recognizable to devotees of the British automaker.
All of them were the brainchild of the same man: Gil Dezer, who for more than a decade has been quietly betting on this moment, expanding his brand partnerships as Miami's housing values climbed. "The car brands of today want to be not just car brands, but also lifestyle brands as well," said Mr. Dezer, who partnered with Porsche in 2012. "The same goes for everything from golf clubs to sunglasses. And we were fortunate enough to be able to get in on it for real estate."
Mr. Dezer's father, Michael Dezer, is the founder of Dezer Development, the South Florida-based real estate giant that owns nine towers on nearly 30 oceanfront acres of Miami. He is also a fervid car collector, with at least 1,800 vehicles -- many of them housed in a privately owned museum. The younger Mr. Dezer, whose own 32-car collection is significantly more modest, joined the company nearly three decades ago, ready to take his place at the altar of a church that prayed to two gods: real estate and automobiles.
While Armani is slightly out of their comfort zone, auto-branded buildings made sense for the company. The Dezers are also well versed in branded real estate. Gil Dezer was the first developer to license Donald Trump's name, and Dezer Development eventually built six Trump-branded towers. He's open in his support for the former president and even held his 2007 wedding ceremony at Mar-a-Lago. But in the early 2010s, the company shifted gears, announcing a licensing agreement with Porsche -- the company's first.
Mr. Dezer knew that for the project to be a success, he'd have to think outside of the box.
"Porsche doesn't exactly correlate with real estate," Mr. Dezer said.
The building, which broke ground in 2014 and opened in 2017, has the same sleek, souped-up masculine energy of the car shows Mr. Dezer frequented as a child with his father. There is no dedicated pedestrian access. Visitors arrive beneath a graphite-hued archway bearing the words "Porsche Design" in the automaker's trademark 911 Porscha font. They can park and enter the airy lobby done up in the same bronze, red and black of Porsche's logo, or continue in their vehicles into the building's patented car elevator, called the Dezervator, which whisks both cars and drivers up 60 stories to units with sky-high garages.
That elevator -- which deposits cars behind a glass wall in front of each unit -- is "a highlight" of the building, said Stefan Buescher, the chief executive of Porsche Lifestyle Group, in a statement. "It was a natural continuation to transfer our unique design principles to the world of real estate," he said.
Mr. Dezer spent $ 480 million to build the Porsche Design Tower, where 132 units run between $ 4 and $ 32 million. Ten percent of his outlay, he estimates, was on the production of the Dezervator alone. He calls it money well spent.
"I initially did it because I thought, 'How cool would it be to have your Porsche or your Lamborghini or Bugatti in your living room?"' he said. "But what really happened is people starting buying units for the privacy. Because if you live in a condo, especially if you're famous, the most annoying thing is driving through the front entrance or dealing with the valet. We avoided that."
Brand recognition sealed the deal for Juan Pablo Verdiquio, 46, a Miami-based real estate developer who moved into a three-bedroom unit in the Porsche Design Tower in 2017. He now counts Lionel Messi, as well as Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz, among his neighbors. As someone who owns a few Porsche cars -- he drives a Taycan; his wife prefers a Panamera Turbo -- he felt this condo purchase came with a preapproved stamp of quality in Miami's crowded market.
"There are thousands of new apartments built each year here, so going with a brand I knew felt like a way to preserve the long-term value," said Mr. Verdiquio. "From a financial sense, I really liked that it was branded with Porsche."
Carlos Rosso, a luxury Miami developer, said that home buyers are increasingly embracing logic like Mr. Verdiquio when buying real estate, elevating the power of legacy brands that cross over into the residential space.
"We are all in the same market for buyers, and we are all trying to differentiate our products," he said. "Every residential building needs to tell a story, and branding is a way to not have to explain what a building is all about. You're associating yourself with a brand that's already familiar."
As the head of Rosso Development, Mr. Rosso is currently focused on The Standard Residences, Midtown Miami, a 12-story condominium tower looking to lure buyers by tapping the unabashedly rakish vibe of the Standard Hotels, perhaps best known for their West Hollywood iteration, where lithe, spray-tanned models lounged in a plexiglass box behind the front desk.
In 2014, Mr. Rosso also partnered with Mr. Dezer on Residences by Armani Casa, a 56-story condo tower just a stone's throw from the Porsche Design Tower. The building opened in December 2019. Giorgio Armani himself designed the tapestries, textiles and hand-selected the furnishings, and the result is an extreme yin to Porsche's yang. Whereas the Porsche Design Tower has a millionaire-meets-man-cave vibe, all sharp edges and bold primary hues, Residences by Armani Casa is feminine and lush, with muted floral wallpaper and curved furnishings in taupe and gold.
Now Mr. Dezer is turning his attention to Bentley Residences Miami, scheduled to break ground later this year on the site of Miami's Thunderbird Motel, which was built in the 1950s and was demolished in June. The 62-story oceanfront building, he said, will take the amenities offered in the Porsche Design Tower and supercharge them: There will be four Dezervator elevators, garages that can house three or four cars and private outdoor swimming pools attached to each of the 216 units. Ocean-view residences will also have outdoor showers. Common spaces will include a Macallan Whisky Bar, a restaurant by Todd English, and a cigar lounge. Units are priced between $ 5.5 million and $ 35 million.
"People are looking for something unique," said Ian Reisner, vice president of Dezer Development. "There's not a million Porsches up and down the block -- there's only one. Now we're going to do even better with Bentley."
For serious car collectors looking to translate horse power to housing, Miami offers other options. In downtown Miami, the 391-unit Aston Martin Residences, currently under construction and scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, is nearly completely sold out.
The 66-story tower is shaped like a gleaming curved sail, with units starting at $ 6.5 million and climbing to $ 59 million for the triplex penthouse, which comes with your very own Aston Martin Vulcan, a rare $ 2.3-million hypercar. The building, which calls itself "A car made into a skyscraper" on its website, is meant to embody a timeless, James Bond-approved, zeitgeist. When it opens, said the developer, German Coto, "It will be appreciated by those who value a unique luxury lifestyle."
Miami is the current epicenter of crossover luxury branded real estate: In addition to Porsche, Bentley, Armani and Aston Martin, there's a 58-unit Fendi Chateau building tucked between Miami Beach and Sunny Isles in Surfside; the Missoni Baia residences, offering 249 units ranging from one-bedrooms to five-bedrooms, opened earlier this year on a colorful, resort-like campus overlooking Biscayne Bay.
But the movement is global. Overlooking the Persian Gulf on Jumeira Bay Island in Dubai, the Bulgari Lighthouse -- a whitewashed 27-story tower with a branched, undulating facade meant to imitate coral -- is under development from the luxury watchmaker. Lamborghini, whose first attempt at branded residential property in Dubai never got off the ground, is now in the construction fast lane, with planned developments in Egypt, Brazil, China and Spain. The Lebanese fashion designer Elie Saab, known for his slinky, ethereal evening gowns, has put his stamp on residences in London and Dubai, and the house of Karl Lagerfeld, who single-handedly defined some of fashion's most recognizable iconography of the 20th century, is translating his eye for design into five villas on Marbella's Golden Mile.
All of these developments, said Clelia Warburg Peters, managing partner of Era Ventures, a tech-based real estate venture fund, are name-brand playgrounds for the wealthy, and we should expect to see more of them as the housing market remains tight.
"We're living in a new Gilded Age and there's a lot of rich people," she said. "In the past, the primary way to differentiate high-end assets was with location. But there are only so many truly prime locations."
Developers, she said, shouldn't be surprised if more nontraditional brands try to inch their way into the residential real estate space in the near future, as well.
"I don't think anyone wants to live in the Coca-Cola building," Ms. Peters said. "But would I be surprised if Restoration Hardware brought out their own line of homes? Absolutely not. This is one of the most significant areas of growth in the real estate industry."

Full text: Twelve years after opening "The Book of Mormon," the two actors -- and good friends -- return with "Gutenberg! The Musical!"
Josh Gad still remembers the first time he and Andrew Rannells met, in June 2010 in a Los Angeles audition suite. No matter what Gad did during their scenes together, Rannells didn't laugh. Not once.
Rannells was auditioning for "The Book of Mormon," the new musical from the creators of "South Park." Gad, then a correspondent on "The Daily Show," had long been attached. The producers wanted a celebrity opposite him, and they'd invited several to these tryouts. Rannells, a replacement actor in "Hairspray" and "Jersey Boys," was not remotely famous. Confronted with Gad's cyclone energy, he chose stillness.
"I was so intimidated. And it really upset me," Gad said, over dinner at Chez Josephine, a theater district mainstay where Rannells, in younger days, used to work the coat check. Gad turned to Rannells. "I had that Tony locked until you walked in the door. And I still had a grudge because you beat me out for 'Jersey Boys."' (It was unclear if Gad was joking. Then again, Gad is almost always joking.)
"The Book of Mormon" opened in 2011, to rapturous reviews, with Rannells as the strait-laced Mormon missionary Elder Price and Gad as his co-evangelist Elder Cunningham, whose laces are a lot looser. Both men were nominated for a Tony Award and both men lost out to Norbert Leo Butz for "Catch Me If You Can." Somewhere along the way, they became close friends, which was apparent over dinner, a symphony of bits, riffs and callbacks between bites of tuna tartare and duck breast. They had ordered identical meals and identical Diet Cokes.
Rannells, 45, has spent his post "Mormon" years in other Broadway shows and on television ("Girls," "Black Monday," "Girls5Eva"). Gad, 42, has since become a voice-over luminary ("Frozen," Frozen 2," "Central Park"). Now they are reuniting, one block south and one block east of their "Mormon" haunts, in "Gutenberg! The Musical!" which begins previews at the James Earl Jones Theater on Sept. 15.
"Gutenberg!" directed by Alex Timbers and written by Scott Brown and Anthony King, is a farcical, largehearted duet about a pair of nursing home workers, Bud and Doug, bitten grievously by the Broadway bug. Using an inheritance and the proceeds from the sale of a home, they rent a Broadway theater for one night, hoping to find a producer for their deeply misguided and tragically under-researched original musical about Johannes Gutenberg, who invented a method of printing from movable type and published the Gutenberg Bible.
Two old friends finding a vehicle for a Broadway return has the whiff of a vanity project. But this deliriously silly show, in which the two actors play dozens of characters and wear a combined 107 baseball caps, demands that vanity be left at the stage door.
Over dinner, Gad joked (probably!) that when Timbers had sent him a photo of those 107 hats, each inscribed with the name of one of the show's characters, he'd tried to back out.
"It was too late," Rannells said.
"I know," Gad said. "I read my contract last night."
The day after dinner, at a rehearsal space at the Alvin Ailey Extension, Gad and Rannells were stumbling through (with an emphasis, perhaps, on stumbling) the second act of "Gutenberg!" In a scene at the top of the act, as Bud and Doug introduced themselves to the audience, Rannells hit Gad in the face, perhaps accidentally.
"That's assault," Gad said.
"You walked into it," Rannells replied. Moments later they were standing cheek to cheek, singing spooky oo-oo-oos.
Rannells was wearing a shirt and shorts in complementary greens, his wavy hair reliably perfect. Gad was all in black. He was also drinking an iced coffee. Given his typical energy levels, this seemed like a bad idea. He had burst into the rehearsal room after the lunch break singing "Unchained Melody" with heavy vibrato. He also riffed on a line from "Sunset Boulevard": "We taught the world new ways to dream."
"No," Rannells said. He hugged Gad. Or maybe he gave him a mild version of the Heimlich maneuver. This is more or less their way, with Gad as an avatar of chaos and Rannells in smirking control.
Casey Nicholaw, the director of "The Book of Mormon," had noted this contrast. "Josh's comedy basically just says, 'Watch me. Love me.' Josh is just out there," he said. "And Andrew's is sneaky. Andrew knows how to just hold himself with grace and dignity and then just go for it."
Each has a different process, a different style, a different affect. Collaborators I spoke with compared them to famous comic duos -- Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello. Gad cited "The Odd Couple."
"I definitely am more anxious than he is," Gad said over dinner. "I'm a bundle of anxiety when it comes to learning dances. I'm a bundle of anxiety when it comes to getting lines right." Gad said that he is also a hypochondriac and that sometimes, offstage during "The Book of Mormon," Rannells would suggest possible diseases for him.
"He's got a mean streak," Gad said. "I can say that now." Rannells, sipping his Diet Coke, didn't deny it.
Despite that mean streak, a friendship endures. Nikki M. James, their "Mormon" co-star, recalled watching it begin. "Onstage, they played very different people who end up becoming each other's best friends," she said in a recent interview. "That camaraderie and friendship and love and sense of family, it was very clear offstage as well."
That show left them inextricably linked. "When I die, if I get an obituary in The New York Times, Josh's name will also be in it," Rannells said, somewhat darkly.
And after they departed "The Book of Mormon," each for a quickly canceled sitcom ("1600 Penn" for Gad, "The New Normal" for Rannells), they would often talk about how they might work together again. A revival of "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" was mooted. So was a revival of "The Producers." About four years ago Timbers ("Moulin Rouge," "Beetlejuice") had another idea.
Brown and King ("Beetlejuice") had first conceived "Gutenberg!" more than 20 years ago. Back then, King was a musical theater intern at Manhattan Theater Club. Tasked with sifting through the slush pile, he found himself listening to home-recorded tapes and CDs of new musicals, most of them sung through by the author or authors, most of them hopeless. King thought that he and Brown could write something just as bad. Worse even.
"We tried to come up with, like, what's a terrible idea for a musical?" King said.
But what began as a way to prank King's boss evolved into something just a little more sincere. As King put it, "We fell in love with our own dumb stuff."
In 2003, Brown and King performed a 45-minute version of the show at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in New York. It ran for about two years. With encouragement from a producer, they wrote a second act and took it to London. The show that emerged was never about the real Gutenberg -- Bud and Doug have only the vaguest ideas of how movable type and medieval history work. Instead it was a loving lampoon of Broadway wishes and tropes.
But for the Off Broadway premiere in 2006, directed by Timbers, the creators stepped out in favor of actual actors, Christopher Fitzgerald and Jeremy Shamos, which made it feel more like a real show and less like a goofball routine written by two starving artist roommates.
There had been conversations about moving the show to Broadway. Those conversations had never been especially earnest. Then Timbers slipped Gad the script, hoping that he would share it in turn with Rannells. Which is exactly what happened.
With Brown and King and Timbers, the actors met for a reading in workshop in Los Angeles in March 2020, an inauspicious moment for Broadway-bound musicals. The reading went well. To succeed, the friendship between Bud and Doug has to feel ardent, unbreakable. Gad and Rannells had that.
So after a delay of about three years, conversations began again. A two-person show felt overwhelming, especially one in which the actors also had to serve as their own crew, moving each prop and set piece. Gad described it as "more intimate, and yet much more insane than even 'Mormon."' Still, he and Rannells agreed.
In rehearsal, that insanity was in evidence. The two men were playing not only Bud (Gad), the composer, and Doug (Rannells), the book writer, but also every other baseball-capped character. And they had to play them with all the naïveté and enthusiasm that newbie writers would bring, but also with the necessary skills of a practiced musical theater performer, because bad acting and bad singing aren't funny for long.
"You have to commit to doing fully lived-in characters by performers who otherwise would not be on Broadway," Gad said.
"It's literally a hat on a hat on a hat on a hat," Rannells sighed.
Hats aside, they seemed to be having a pretty good time, particularly during one sequence where Rannells reenacted an eagle attacking a sea gull, while Gad, playing a pubescent girl, did a sexy, scary skeleton dance.
It wasn't all skeletons and sea gulls. Opening a Broadway show is stressful. "I think our actual human sweat will give us away," Rannells said. "I'm going to be a real mess 10 minutes into the show." Opening a Broadway show with a best friend in accidental smacking distance is stressful in a different way. But it's also pretty nice. "Gutenberg!" is about two characters supporting each other, through thick and thin and third reprise. And as Gad and Rannells tell it, that tracks for the actors, too.
"There are times where I want to fall down and just cry at how tiring the show is," Gad said. "Then I look at Rannells and I'm like, 'OK, he's going to keep me upright."'
He turned to Rannells, adding, "I'm so happy you got 'Jersey Boys' now. Now I actually think they made the right choice."

Britain and Tata to Spend $1.6 Billion on Steel Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The plan aims to cut both emissions and financial losses at Britain's largest steel mill, but a union says it will also put many jobs at risk.
The British government and Tata Steel on Friday announced a 1.25-billion-pound package, or about $ 1.6 billion, to cut emissions and financial losses at Tata's steel mill -- the country's largest -- at Port Talbot in Wales, potentially putting many of the plant's 4,000 jobs at risk.
The government said the package would help clean up a site that it said was Britain's largest emitter, reducing the country's overall carbon emissions by 1.5 percent, and would ultimately preserve thousands of jobs. It will provide £500 million, with Tata contributing £750 million.
Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, said the deal was "expected to save thousands of jobs in the long term." But the government's statement refers to safeguarding only 5,000 jobs in Britain; Tata Steel employs more than 8,000 people, about half of them at Port Talbot.
A union that represents the bulk of steel production workers in Britain said the arrangement risked falling short of the stated goals. While Tata says the plan would "preserve significant employment," it is not guaranteeing jobs and has been losing money on its British operations for years.
"This deal will have devastating consequences for jobs and workers," the Community Union said in a statement on Friday. "It will rip the heart out of the Port Talbot community."
Tata said it would soon begin talks with the unions, including on a "potential deep restructuring" at Port Talbot.
Tata and the government proposed to replace the giant blast furnaces at Port Talbot, which use coal to extract iron from ore, with an electric furnace that melts scrap metal to make steel, a less polluting process. The government said the plant was nearing the end of its life.
But the new plant, which may require years to build, may not produce as much steel as the old facilities or employ as many people.
Steel-making units like blast furnaces and coke ovens would close, the union said, and an electric furnace is not likely to produce the same quality steel as a blast furnace, leading to job cuts at related plants.
"We believe that with electric arc furnaces, there is no way they can keep the portfolio they have got," said Alun Davies, a union official. "It is concerning."
Operations would be subject to the availability and price of electricity, which tends to be expensive in Britain, and to the fluctuations of the scrap metal market. The union said the steel produced by an electric furnace would not be suitable for some auto components and food and beverage containers, potentially leading to the closure of the plants that produce steel for those products and putting hundreds of jobs at risk.
Tata has been running large losses at its British operations and looking at solutions including mergers and, potentially, plant closings for years. In a recent filing, the company said the British steel unit lost £279 million in the latest financial year.
"It has been an absolute pleasure to work with" the British government, said Natarajan Chandrasekaran, the chairman of Tata Group, the parent company, in a statement.
The announcement is the latest example of the British government's being lobbied to put up substantial sums to preserve local jobs. On Monday, the government said it would provide support to help BMW produce electric versions of the popular Mini cars in Britain.
The government also agreed this year to provide an undisclosed amount of aid to encourage the Tata Group to invest £4 billion in a factory that would produce batteries likely to be used in electric vehicles made in Britain by Jaguar Land Rover, which the Indian conglomerate owns.

Trump Held Private Talks Urging G.O.P. To Impeach: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The former president has talked regularly with members of the House Freedom Caucus and other congressional Republicans who pushed for impeachment.
On a sweeping patio overlooking the golf course at his private club in Bedminster, N.J., former President Donald J. Trump dined Sunday night with a close political ally, Marjorie Taylor Greene.
It was a chance for the former president to catch up with the hard-right Georgia congresswoman. But over halibut and Diet Cokes, Ms. Greene brought up an issue of considerable interest to Mr. Trump -- the push by House Republicans to impeach his likely opponent in next year's election.
"I did brief him on the strategy that I want to see laid out with impeachment," Ms. Greene said in a brief phone interview.
Mr. Trump's dinner with Ms. Greene came just two nights before Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced his decision on Tuesday to order the opening of an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, under intense pressure from his right flank.
Over the past several months, Mr. Trump has kept a close watch on House Republicans' momentum toward impeaching Mr. Biden. Mr. Trump has talked regularly by phone with members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus and other congressional Republicans who pushed for impeachment, according to a person close to Mr. Trump who was not authorized to publicly discuss the conversations. Mr. Trump has encouraged the effort both privately and publicly.
Ms. Greene, who has introduced articles of impeachment against Mr. Biden, said she told Mr. Trump that she wanted the impeachment inquiry to be "long and excruciatingly painful for Joe Biden."
She would not say what Mr. Trump said in response, but she said her ultimate goal was to have a "long list of names" -- people whom she claimed were co-conspirators involved in Biden family crimes. She said she was confident Mr. Trump would win back the White House in 2024 and that she wanted "to go after every single one of them and use the Department of Justice to prosecute them."
While Mr. Biden's son Hunter is under investigation by a special counsel who is expected to lodge a gun charge against him soon and could also charge him with failure to file his tax returns on time, Republicans have not shown that Mr. Biden committed any crimes. House Republicans are proceeding with the impeachment inquiry without proof that Mr. Biden took official actions as vice president to benefit his son's financial interests or that he directly profited from his son's foreign deals.
Mr. Trump has also spoken weekly over the past month to Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, the third-ranking House Republican, according to a person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to discuss them publicly. During those conversations, Ms. Stefanik also briefed Mr. Trump on the impeachment inquiry strategy, this person said.
The former president thanked Ms. Stefanik for publicly backing the impeachment inquiry in July, the person added. Ms. Stefanik, who talked to Mr. Trump again on Tuesday after Mr. McCarthy ordered the impeachment inquiry, had been the first member of House Republican leadership to publicly call for taking the first step in the process of impeaching Mr. Biden.
A person familiar with Mr. Trump's thinking said that despite his eagerness to see an inquiry move forward, the former president has not been twisting Mr. McCarthy's arm. Mr. Trump has been far more aggressive in pushing several members to wipe his own impeachment record clean, the person said, potentially by getting Congress to take the unprecedented step of expunging his two impeachments from the House record.
Mr. Trump has not been expressing concern about the possibility that the McCarthy impeachment effort might backfire and benefit Mr. Biden, according to two people with direct knowledge of his private statements over several months. Instead, he wondered to an ally why there had been no movement on impeaching Mr. Biden once he learned that the House was back in session.
A spokesman for Mr. McCarthy did not respond to a question about his interactions with the former president regarding impeachment.
When asked for comment, Mr. Trump's communications director, Steven Cheung, pointed to Mr. Trump's public statements about impeaching Mr. Biden.
The former president's public commentary on the possibility of a Biden impeachment has escalated from wistful musings about the Justice Department's supposed inaction to explicit demands.
"They persecuted us and yet Joe Biden is a stone-cold criminal, caught dead to right, and nothing happens to him. Forget the family. Nothing happens to him," the former president said at a rally in March.
In a June town hall with the Fox News host Sean Hannity, Mr. Trump lamented what happened after authorities found boxes of classified documents in both Mar-a-Lago and the Bidens' Delaware residence.
"It is a dual system of government," Mr. Trump said. "You talk about law and order. You can't have law and order in a country where you have such corruption."
That same month, after Mr. Trump was arraigned on charges that he had improperly retained sensitive national security documents and obstructed investigators, he declared that if re-elected he would appoint a special prosecutor to "go after" Mr. Biden and his family.
By July, Mr. Trump had begun suggesting that Republicans should impeach the president, and as the summer wore on, he conveyed his desire with greater urgency.
"So, they impeach me over a 'perfect' phone call, and they don't impeach Biden for being the most corrupt president in the history of the United States???" Mr. Trump wrote in all caps on his website, Truth Social.
In yet another nearly all-cap Truth Social post in late August, the former president wrote, referring to congressional Republicans: "Either impeach the bum, or fade into oblivion. They did it to us!"

California May Be First In U.S. to Ban Caste Bias: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The bill, which was passed by the State Legislature this week, has led to intense debate among South Asian immigrants.
Ramesh Suman, a real estate agent in Antioch, Calif., remembers the client who refused to see a house after saying that it looked like it belonged to members of the Dalit community, a historically oppressed group of people relegated below even the lowest rung of the caste hierarchy once predominant in South Asia.
Bhim Narayan Bishwakarma recalled how a landlord accepted his deposit but later reneged on a rental after learning his surname, which is common among Nepalese Dalit families.
And Dr. Promila Dhanuka said that once word got around more than 15 years ago in Redding, Calif., that she had Dalit roots, some Indian American doctors stopped referring patients to her oncology practice.
While many South Asian immigrants face discrimination in the United States, those with Dalit ancestry -- once deemed to be "untouchable" from birth -- say they must also overcome being ostracized by fellow South Asian immigrants who cling to a social stratification that dates back millenniums. That has occurred even though untouchability and caste-based discrimination have been outlawed in India and Nepal for decades.
Nowhere in the United States has the subject been as prominent -- or as divisive -- as in California. Three years ago, the state's Civil Rights Department accused two engineers of caste discrimination at Cisco Systems in a landmark lawsuit. This week, the State Legislature sent a bill to Gov. Gavin Newsom that could make California the first state to expressly prohibit such bias.
In more than a dozen interviews, people who identify as Dalits described various encounters with caste-based bigotry in the United States, in the form of wage theft, housing discrimination, mistreatment in the workplace and social exclusion.
They spoke of the shame and anger they felt hearing slurs used in reference to Dalits. Many said that they felt pressure to hide their identity and that they lived in constant fear of being "outed," despite being in a country they saw as a haven free of the caste vestiges of their homelands.
"I really thought I had left untouchability or caste-based discrimination back in Nepal," said Mr. Bishwakarma, who works at a convenience store in El Cerrito, Calif. "I never thought that one day I would be discriminated against just on the basis of caste in a country like the U.S."
The issue has prompted fierce debate over how pervasive caste discrimination is within the South Asian community in America, which has grown dramatically in recent years and reached around 5.4 million people. Those who oppose an express ban say they believe such discrimination is rare and that writing it into state law will unfairly malign South Asian Americans by associating them with antiquated social beliefs.
In California, many community members have faced off against one another at the State Capitol and various City Council chambers, showing how immigrant communities can become factionalized as they expand and become more diverse.
Since 1965, most South Asians who have immigrated to the United States have been highly educated people who could trace their origins to the upper caste, in part because they had greater access to the resources necessary to qualify for skilled worker visas.
But the makeup of South Asian immigrants has changed in recent years, particularly among those from India, where affirmative action has enabled more people from oppressed communities to attend universities and move abroad.
While conditions generally have improved in South Asia for those who were once relegated to the lowest tiers, segregation based on caste remains persistent, and many people of Dalit background still face discrimination, mistreatment and violence.
Most Americans are unaware of the caste distinctions in South Asia, and the Cisco lawsuit served as a wake-up call to Democratic lawmakers in California. The issue is especially acute in the tech industry, where South Asians comprise a significant share of Silicon Valley workers, many of them first-generation immigrants.
"The more diverse California becomes, the more diverse our laws have to be and the further we have to go to protect more people," Aisha Wahab, a Democratic state senator who introduced the caste discrimination bill, said in an interview. Senator Wahab is the first Afghan American elected to the State Legislature and the first Muslim to serve in the State Senate.
Opposition to the bill has been driven by some Hindu residents and organizations, who have been vocal throughout the year. They argue that the proposal unfairly targets Hindus because the caste system is most commonly associated with Hinduism.
They also say that existing laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of religion and ancestry are sufficient, while pointing out that caste discrimination was outlawed in India more than 70 years ago.
"I personally see this as something that does not exist in society," said Praveen Sinha, a professor of accounting at California State University, Long Beach, who filed a lawsuit last year challenging the university system's addition of caste to its discrimination policy.
Opponents say that expressly naming caste as a protected characteristic disproportionately makes South Asians more vulnerable to unfair accusations of discrimination for actions that may have nothing to do with caste. They see redemption in the state dropping its case against the two managers at the heart of the Cisco case, though its lawsuit against the company is still ongoing.
The State Legislature, in an attempt to address such concerns, amended Senator Wahab's bill this summer to make caste a subset of ancestry discrimination rather than its own class. But that did not satisfy critics. Some say that writing caste into state law will draw greater attention to outdated South Asian distinctions rather than dissolve them.
"We are all in America now and our kids are second- and third-generation," said Samir Kalra, managing director for policy and programs at the Hindu American Foundation, one of the organizations leading the opposition. "As immigrants, we want to create a better society and lifestyle and leave all these issues behind."
It is difficult to know how widespread caste discrimination is in the United States. A 2020 survey of Indian Americans conducted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace found that only 5 percent of respondents reported having encountered caste discrimination. The same survey found that Hindus born outside the country were significantly more likely than U.S.-born respondents to identify with a caste group.
Some people with Dalit ancestry have said they are hesitant to report discrimination for fear that it could jeopardize their visa status in the United States or invite retaliation. The bill's proponents point out that caste bias is not confined to Hinduism, and is present in other religious communities.
"It's not that caste is something that has just popped up," said Sangay Mishra, an associate professor of political science at Drew University and the author of "Desis Divided: The Political Lives of South Asian Americans." "As culture travels from India to the diaspora, as language travels, as cuisine travels, so does caste. We are just talking about a different scale now."
Feelings remain intense on both sides of the bill. Proponents started a hunger strike this week that they said would last until Governor Newsom signed the legislation. Opponents have started a recall drive against Senator Wahab.
On a recent weekday, dozens of people, most of them first-generation immigrants, gathered at the State Capitol to rally in support of the bill. The group listened carefully as Thenmozhi Soundararajan, the founder of Equality Labs, a Dalit civil rights organization, coached them on how to answer questions about the measure. A picnic of chapati and chai waited on the grass nearby.
Backers have acknowledged that existing laws can be used to fight caste discrimination. But they say an explicit definition in state law would provide greater assurance for victims who want to speak out. And they believe that the bill would raise broader awareness about such bias and how it may surface -- that questions about one's dietary habits or parents' occupations may be more than a matter of personal curiosity.
Among the supporters was Sunita Singh. Since moving to the United States from India in the early 1980s, Ms. Singh said she and her family had faced more discrimination based on race than on caste. She recalled how, after the Sept. 11 attacks, her son's locker was glued shut at his high school because classmates thought he was Muslim.
But Ms. Singh said that caste discrimination was a problem, too. Not long after she arrived in America, members of her Ravidassia religious community, which has Dalit roots, were asked to use separate pots and pans at the Sikh temple that they had been renting in Central California.
For Ms. Singh and others in her group, the request evoked the practice, still found in parts of India, of having people of Dalit lineage eat with separate cups and plates to prevent them from "polluting" those used by higher castes.
The incident decades ago became the impetus for Ms. Singh and the other Ravidassia to establish their own temple. There are now six Ravidassia temples in California, and the community has been among the most vocal backers of the bill banning caste discrimination.
"We don't want to be treated in this country any different than other Americans," Ms. Singh said. "We want to be treated like humans."

Hybrid work around the world: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In London, a politician wrote not-so-subtle notes to remote workers last year, hoping to persuade them to spend more time in the office: "Sorry you were out when I visited," Jacob Rees-Mogg, then a government minister, recalled writing in messages left on the desks of Cabinet Office staff members who were working from home.
In Seoul, Jem Kim, who started a new job at a private equity firm, hoped to ask for permission to work some days from home, but she quickly learned that she would need to be in the office full time.
And in San Mateo, Calif., executives at Sequoia, a human resources technology company, said that although they had not mandated a return to office for most employees, they had tried to make the office environment so close-knit that people couldn't help but feel "major FOMO" (fear of missing out) when they joined meetings by videoconference.
When the coronavirus pandemic began in 2020, many industries around the world shifted to remote or hybrid work. It was an experiment that yielded different results for different cities -- with long-term standoffs between executives and workers in some cases, and a sweeping return to the office in others.
Levels of remote work have varied across regions based on factors like housing density, length of Covid lockdowns and cultural norms about how much workers can fight for workplace autonomy, according to interviews with nearly two dozen workers and executives, as well as a study that included researchers at Stanford, Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México and the Ifo Institute, who surveyed more than 42,000 workers in 34 countries.
Whether a person is more likely to work at a cubicle in a big office tower or on a couch in their living room depends on where in the world those cubicles and couches are. Many Asian countries have lower levels of remote work than countries in Europe and North America. Those with the highest levels are Britain, Canada and the United States.
In the United States and Britain, workers across industries spent five to six paid days a month this spring working from home, according to the study. Other European countries had slightly lower levels of remote work, with Germans at four days per month. Asia's work-from-home levels were the lowest, with South Koreans working less than two days per month remotely, Japan two and Taiwan under three.
The researchers think housing plays a role in return-to-office patterns. In suburban parts of the United States, where people have larger homes and sometimes home offices, workers have been slower to go back to the office. In densely populated cities, particularly in Asia, return-to-office rates have tended to be higher, often because people struggled to be productive in small apartments shared with many family members.
Commute vs. Productivity
"It's really hard to work from home if you live with a partner and have a one-bedroom apartment," said Jose Maria Barrero, an economist at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México, or ITAM, who helped lead the global study. "Tokyo, for example, is a place where apartments are quite modest."
Executives managing work forces that sprawl across continents have noticed the regional variability firsthand. Jeetu Patel, an executive vice president and general manager at the technology company Cisco, which has nearly 85,000 employees, traveled to Asia recently and found that his company's offices there, as well as those of its customers, were more bustling than offices in other countries. Cisco has let its teams across the globe determine their own approach to hybrid work.
Mr. Patel, who lives in Los Altos, Calif., said he preferred to work from home when he did not have in-office meetings so he could spare himself an hour traveling to San Jose and back.
"I can take that 30 minutes going back and forth commuting and I can have more things I get done," he said. "I like having dinner with my daughter."
Daan van Rossum, chief executive of FlexOS, a company in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, that creates digital solutions for remote managers, thought extensively about employees' home setups when considering his company's approach to hybrid work.
"A lot of people here don't have their own places," he said. "Working from home at the kitchen table with three generations running around is not the best environment to be productive."
This year, Mr. van Rossum asked his employees to begin working in the office at least two days a week. He tried to make the experience enjoyable by carving out time for levity. Every meeting starts with a nonwork-related icebreaker, like a game of telephone.
Beyond housing differences, researchers said, remote work levels are affected by the amount of time a region spent in Covid lockdowns. In areas of the world that lurched in and out of lockdowns repeatedly, like some American cities, workers and employers became more settled in remote work routines. People invested in comfortable setups at home, buying computer monitors and ergonomic chairs. Companies set up management systems that ensured bosses would measure performance by employee output, not by the amount of time people spent at the office.
Where Remote Never Took Hold
That kind of long-term investment in hybrid work came in handy in 2021 and 2022, as many companies delayed return-to-office plans because of infectious coronavirus variants.
"People realized, 'Hey, you know what, I can be just as productive and effective working remotely as I can being in the same location as the rest of my co-workers,"' said Dawn Klinghoffer, head of people analytics at Microsoft, which has required employees to return to the office 50 percent of the time, with more flexibility for those who need it.
In parts of Asia, remote work routines did not become as entrenched. "There were many countries in Asia that controlled early waves of Covid pretty well without extended lockdowns," Mr. Barrero of ITAM said. "They didn't have this experience where they had to hunker down for months on end working from home and get adapted to it."
In South Korea, for example, many workers never left their offices. "We've never implemented work from home," said Joori Roh, a spokeswoman for SK Hynix, a major chip maker, adding that the company did not like the idea of giving some workers a privilege that was not available to all.
In Japan, workers still routinely use fax machines, and sometimes a personal stamp known as a hanko, which requires someone to be in the office. Some corporate managers in Tokyo said being together in the same space helped them keep an eye on the people who reported to them.
"Sometimes, I get very worried about whether they are actually working," said Ryuichi Takezawa, who manages some 30 employees at Astellas Pharma in Tokyo. In the office, he said, he can ask his team questions: "How are you feeling? What are you stressed about? What can I support you with?"
Do Employees Have a Say?
The researchers of the remote-work study said cultural norms are also a factor in return-to-work levels. Plenty of American workers said they felt comfortable asking their managers for more flexibility, or even telling them that they would quit without it.
When Laura Zimm, a public defender in Duluth, Minn., was called back to the office last year, she immediately came down with Covid. She worked from home during and after her sickness, and eventually decided with her manager that she would stay permanently remote, which Ms. Zimm preferred and which gave her manager more flexibility with office space.
At Microsoft, the return-to-office process has often included "team agreements," in which managers meet with employees to discuss hybrid work preferences.
In parts of Europe, unions and other worker associations have helped shape return-to-office policies. At many German firms, for example, employee-elected councils negotiated with managers on the details of hybrid work.
"We needed to find a solution that would work for all of our employees, whether in software development, finance or on the shop floor," said Julia Bangerth, head of human resources at Datev, a software company in Nuremberg that allows every team to set its own return-to-office expectations.
And the choices that individual employers make are not isolated. In areas of the world where remote or hybrid work has become a norm, employers with strict return-to-office policies worry about retaining talent, said Mark Ein, chairman of the workplace security firm Kastle, which has tracked American office occupancy levels with its "Back to Work Barometer."
"Business leaders as a group have wanted people to come back in much more profound ways," Mr. Ein said. "It really is the labor market's competitive pressures and some cultural norms that have prevented it."
"The desire to get people back among business managers is nearly universal," he added. "It's the ability to do it that varies across countries."

In London, a politician wrote not-so-subtle notes to remote workers last year, hoping to persuade them to spend more time in the office: “Sorry you were out when I visited,” Jacob Rees-Mogg, then a government minister, recalled writing in messages left on the desks of Cabinet Office staff members who were working from home.
In Seoul, South Korea, Jem Kim, who started a new job at a private equity firm, hoped to ask for permission to work some days from home, but quickly learned she had to be in the office full time.
And in San Mateo, California, executives at Sequoia, a human resources technology company, said that though they had not mandated a return to office for most employees, they had tried to make the office environment so close-knit that people couldn’t help but feel “major FOMO” (fear of missing out) when they joined meetings by videoconference.
When the coronavirus pandemic took hold in 2020, many industries worldwide shifted to remote or hybrid work. It was an immense experiment that yielded different results for different cities — with long-term standoffs between executives and workers in some cases, and a sweeping return to the office in others.
Levels of remote work have varied across regions based on factors including housing density, length of COVID lockdowns and cultural norms surrounding how much workers can fight for workplace autonomy, according to interviews with nearly two dozen workers and executives, as well as a study that included researchers at Stanford, Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México and the Ifo Institute, who surveyed more than 42,000 workers in 34 countries.
Whether a person is more likely to work in a cubicle in a big office tower or on the living room couch now depends on where in the world those cubicles and couches are. Many Asian countries have lower levels of remote work than countries in Europe and North America. Those with the highest levels are Britain, Canada and the United States.
In the United States and Britain, workers across industries spent five to six paid days a month this spring working from home, according to the study. Other European countries had slightly lower levels of remote work, with Germans at four days per month across industries. Asia’s work-from-home levels were the lowest, with South Koreans working fewer than two days per month remotely, Japan two and Taiwan under three.
Researchers think housing plays a role in return-to-office patterns. In suburban parts of the United States, where people have larger homes and sometimes home offices, workers have been slower to go back to the office. Densely populated cities, particularly in Asia, have tended to see higher return-to-office rates, often because people struggled to be productive in small apartments shared with many family members.
Commute vs. Productivity
“It’s really hard to work from home if you live with a partner and have a one-bedroom apartment,” said Jose Maria Barrero, an economist at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México, or ITAM, who helped lead the global study. “Tokyo, for example, is a place where apartments are quite modest.”
Executives managing workforces that sprawl across continents have noticed the regional variability firsthand. Jeetu Patel, an executive vice president and general manager at technology company Cisco, which has nearly 85,000 employees, traveled to Asia recently and found that his company’s offices there, as well as those of its customers, were more bustling than offices in other countries. Cisco has let its teams worldwide determine their own approach to hybrid work.
Patel, who lives in Los Altos, California, said he preferred to work from home when he did not have in-office meetings so he could spare himself an hour traveling to San Jose and back.
“I can take that 30 minutes going back and forth commuting and I can have more things I get done,” he said. “I like having dinner with my daughter.”
Daan van Rossum, CEO of FlexOS, a company in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, that creates digital solutions for remote managers, thought extensively about employees’ home setups when considering his company’s approach to hybrid work.
“A lot of people here don’t have their own places,” he said. “Working from home at the kitchen table with three generations running around is not the best environment to be productive.”
This year, van Rossum asked his employees to begin working in the office at least two days a week. He tried to make the experience enjoyable by carving out time for levity. Every meeting starts with a nonwork-related icebreaker, like a game of telephone.
Beyond housing differences, researchers said, remote work levels are affected by the amount of time a region spent in COVID lockdowns. In areas of the world that lurched in and out of lockdowns repeatedly, including some U.S. cities, workers and employers became more settled in remote work routines. People invested in comfortable setups at home, buying large computer monitors and ergonomic chairs. Companies set up management systems that ensured bosses would measure performance by employee output, not by the amount of time people spent at the office.
Where Remote Never Took Hold
That kind of long-term investment in hybrid work came in handy in 2021 and 2022, as many companies delayed return-to-office plans because of infectious coronavirus variants.
“People realized, ‘Hey, you know what, I can be just as productive and effective working remotely as I can being in the same location as the rest of my co-workers,’” said Dawn Klinghoffer, head of people analytics at Microsoft, which has required employees to return to the office 50% of the time, with more flexibility for those who need it.
In parts of Asia, remote work routines did not become as entrenched. “There were many countries in Asia that controlled early waves of COVID pretty well without extended lockdowns,” Barrero of ITAM said. “They didn’t have this experience where they had to hunker down for months on end working from home and get adapted to it.”
In South Korea, for example, many workers never left their offices. “We’ve never implemented work from home,” said Joori Roh, a spokesperson for SK Hynix, a major chipmaker, adding that the company did not like the idea of giving some workers a privilege that was not available to all.

Full text: A city's density, the size of people's homes and cultural norms are among the factors that affect hybrid work patterns.
In London, a politician wrote not-so-subtle notes to remote workers last year, hoping to persuade them to spend more time in the office: "Sorry you were out when I visited," Jacob Rees-Mogg, then a government minister, recalled writing in messages left on the desks of Cabinet Office staff members who were working from home.

Job Hopping Looks Bad on the Résumé. Gen Z Doesn't Care.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Repeatedly switching jobs has long been a red flag for employers. That's changing as Gen Z and younger Millennials embrace the upsides, but downsides persist.
Pranav Ravikumar has held three jobs since college, and he's only 24. One month after graduating in December 2020, he cycled through two rotations of a management training program at the pharmaceutical company Abbott. Mr. Ravikumar became an e-commerce analyst, but he wanted the kind of faster-paced work found at consulting firms and start-ups. The job at Abbott also required him to move to Columbus, Ohio, far from family and friends in Washington, D.C.
In October 2021, Mr. Ravikumar left Abbott for a remote job with Dragonfly, a start-up that acquires and develops small e-commerce businesses, and moved back to Washington. A few months in, he spoke to his manager about becoming more involved with strategy, but nothing changed. So a year later, Mr. Ravikumar began job hunting. This February, he started a job in product marketing at Alma, a membership network that helps mental health care providers build their practices.
For Mr. Ravikumar, this kind of rapid job hopping has been a positive experience. "I've almost doubled what my starting salary was at Abbott, and that's important to me," he said. "I really wanted the flexibility of remote work and I'd be hard-pressed now to give that up. And I've gotten a lot of professional experience across industries super quickly."
Job hopping to increase salary and skills early in a career -- historically, a red flag for employers -- is not new. However, it appears to be increasingly common: 22.3 percent of workers ages 20 and older spent a year or less at their jobs in 2022, the highest percentage with a tenure that short since 2006, according to data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, an independent nonprofit. About 33 percent spent two years or less at their jobs.
But many Gen Z workers, and younger Millennials, aren't worried. Seventy-four percent of 18- to 26-year-olds and 62 percent of 27- to 42-year-olds were searching for a new job or planned to search in the next six months, according to a survey of U.S. employees conducted in May by Robert Half, a human resources consultancy.
Dawn Fay, operational president for talent solutions and business consulting at Robert Half, said in an email that the survey also asked hiring managers their top concerns when evaluating a candidate's résumé: 77 percent named job hopping.
Jeff Hyman, chief executive of Recruit Rockstars, a recruitment firm in Chicago, described job hopping as a "huge headache" for employers. When promising employees leave prematurely, others may wonder why, or follow suit, he said. "Human resources executives keep hoping it will improve, but it just seems to get worse by the month."
After just eight months at her corporate job in Pittsburgh, Erin Confortini, 24, was being recruited for similar jobs paying $ 20,000 a year more, but declined to pursue them, feeling the salary wasn't worth the risks of changing course. Ms. Confortini, who now earns additional income as a personal finance influencer on TikTok with over 246,000 followers, posted about her decision not to job hop. (As it turned out, she left the corporate job a year later to work at a start-up.) The post received more than 450 comments, with most advising her to follow the money rather than be loyal to a company ("fear should not drive decisions," read one).
While she understands this position, Ms. Confortini said, "I also think you need to consider what that will look like on your résumé."
Many recruiters agree.
Mr. Hyman, the recruiter, said although job hopping carries less of a stigma in the start-up community, traditional employers still see those candidates as risky. "Employers start to question the candidate's decision-making ability and judgment," he said. Hiring managers also complain that it's difficult to assess a person's performance in a job that lasted less than two years, he added.
To some extent, the trend may be a response to what younger employees perceive as corporations' unyielding focus on the bottom line. One reason for the prevalence of job hopping is the ongoing erosion of the employer-employee social contract, said Jessica Kriegel, a chief scientist at Culture Partners, a business consultancy focused on workplace culture. This is partly because of repeated, recession-related layoffs that now include pre-emptive layoffs in anticipation of a downturn, she said.
"Employees are looking at that and feel they have already lost what they thought they were getting, which was job security," Ms. Kriegel said.
This, in turn, has led many Gen Z workers to eschew company loyalty in favor of career development -- and, potentially, risk-taking. When Jonathan Javier, 28, started his first job as an operations specialist at Snapchat, the pay was low. But he had set his sights on the tech industry and felt grateful to be there. Eight months later, however, his role was outsourced to a contractor. Through LinkedIn, Mr. Javier connected with a recruiter at Google and was hired as an operations analyst; after a year, he made the move to sales trainer.
Soon after, Mr. Javier was tapped by another recruiter, offering a spot as an operations analyst at Cisco. "It was a higher-level job that pushed my salary to over six figures," he recalled. He took it, leaving Google after 18 months. During his tenure at Google, Mr. Javier had started a side hustle, Wonsulting, a career coaching business targeting young job seekers from marginalized backgrounds. When he was laid off a year after joining Cisco because of pandemic staffing cuts, Mr. Javier opted for entrepreneurship instead of another job search, and dived into Wonsulting full time.
That's three companies (and four roles) in just over three years, ending with a job of his own making.
Working for a corporation, Mr. Javier said, always made him feel "like a number," someone who could be dismissed at any time. Now, as his own boss, that anxiety is gone. And although the failure rate for start-ups is high, Mr. Javier said he isn't concerned.
"There's always a way back into corporate America if I want that."

Debunking the 'Recycling Myth,' Starting With Its Symbol: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Many plastics that carry the "chasing arrows" symbol, like soda cups and yogurt tubs, are rarely recycled. A new California law is raising the bar.
Jan Dell is a collector. But instead of art or action figures, she collects what she calls "bad plastic containers." She is a connoisseur and a completist: Her specimens include lids from oatmeal canisters, cups from fast-food joints, cleaners wrapped in shrink sleeves, and many, many Amazon mailers. Each carries the familiar "chasing arrows" recycling symbol; none, she believes, will ever be recycled.
Since 2018, when she gave up her career as a chemical engineer, Ms. Dell has run a one-woman nonprofit, the Last Beach Cleanup, from her home in the hills of Orange County. Her obsessive efforts to end what she calls "the recycling myth" have led to a legal settlement forcing Coca-Cola, Clorox and other companies to modify some of their recycling labels.
Ms. Dell also headed an advisory committee that pushed for a landmark truth-in-labeling law in California. Starting in the fall of 2025, that law will prohibit companies from placing recycling symbols on products that are not widely recycled in the state. Yogurt tubs could be among them. So could baby food pouches. And takeout containers. And coffee cup lids.
In many parts of the country, only plastic bottles and jugs stamped with a 1 or 2 -- like those used for soda, milk and detergent --are reliably recycled. Much of the rest ends up in landfills or polluting the world's waters and shores. The United Nations estimates that humans produce 400 million tons of plastic waste every year.
While accurate labeling may seem a paltry response to this onslaught, Ms. Dell argues that it is one of the most effective ways to curtail waste. More than a third of the world's plastic is used for packaging. And many of the largest makers of consumer goods have promised their packaging will be 100 percent recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025. Ms. Dell's hope is that if companies have to acknowledge that they aren't meeting those criteria, they will switch to more sustainable materials. "When they fully admit, oh, we're selling plastic trash," she said, "then that will motivate them to make changes."
Many manufacturers, reluctant to give up the cheap, long-lasting and versatile material, see it differently. They argue that the focus should not be on what currently isn't recycled, but instead on what could be recycled, if only enough money were devoted to educating consumers and expanding infrastructure.
So California's labeling law is also shining a light on a bigger question: When it comes to sustainable packaging, what does progress look like -- investing in making more plastic recyclable? Or investing in alternatives to plastic?
The great label debate
The now-familiar chasing arrows symbol proliferated in the late 1980s and early '90s, when the plastics industry successfully lobbied nearly 40 states to require it on most plastic products. According to an investigation by NPR and "Frontline," the industry knew most plastic would not be recycled. The industry says the numbers were solely meant to help recyclers sort different types of plastics, but the chasing arrows surrounding them became a de facto, if fallible, marker of recyclability to consumers.
In recent years, industry-funded initiatives have developed new kinds of labeling. How2Recycle, which is funded by membership fees from manufacturing giants like Walmart, Procter & Gamble, Target and Amazon, generates labels used by more than a third of the consumer packaged-goods industry. Those labels offer guidance on whether packaging is recyclable -- and if it is, instructions on how to prepare it, like "rinse and replace lid."
How2Recycle claims it is helping consumers recycle more effectively. But Ms. Dell and others suggest that some of the organization's labels encourage people to believe certain plastics can be reprocessed when they can't.
No material sets off this argument more than polypropylene, the plastic marked with a 5 and commonly used for yogurt tubs and margarine containers. Three years ago, How2Recycle downgraded its polypropylene label, telling consumers it wasn't recycled in all communities. Then, last summer, it changed the label back to "widely recyclable."
The decision to revert the designation came after the Recycling Partnership, another industry-funded group, gave $ 6.7 million to recycling facilities to expand their acceptance and sorting of polypropylene.The group now estimates that more than half of recycling facilities in the United States accept and sort the material.
Paul Nowak, the executive director of How2Recycle's parent organization, sees this as a success story. "It shows the program is working because we downgraded it and then the industry got busy and started doing grants and building back up their system," he said.
But Ms. Dell says that even if more facilities accept polypropylene, that doesn't mean they are selling it for reprocessing and reuse; it is more likely going into a landfill or overseas. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that just 2.7 percent of polypropylene containers and packaging was reprocessed in 2018. The Recycling Partnership says its investment, which has now grown to $ 10.3 million, could eventually increase that amount by 42 million pounds per year, but that is still only about 1 percent of the polypropylene produced for containers and packaging in the United States.
While Keefe Harrison, chief executive of the Recycling Partnership, acknowledges that little polypropylene is being turned into new material right now, she argues that more investment in sorting and reprocessing facilities would improve the chances. Polypropylene recycling is at a "tipping point," she said, noting that Oregon is considering including polypropylene on a forthcoming list of recyclable materials that municipalities are required to collect, sort and sell.
This more expansive, "if only" definition of recyclability is a common industry refrain. "Why say, because it can't be recycled today, we should stop claiming it to be recyclable," said Matt Seaholm, president and chief executive of the Plastics Industry Association, "when we actually can invest and improve the infrastructure to get to where it needs to be?"
Part of the debate is what it means to recycle. In a recent memo, the E.P.A. recommended that a material be marketed as recyclable only if it has a "strong end market," meaning it's sold at a price that's higher than what it would cost to simply throw it away. The chasing arrows symbol, the agency said, "does not accurately represent recyclability, as many plastics (especially 3-7) do not have end markets and are not financially viable to recycle." The agency did note, however, that a growing number of recycling facilities are accepting polypropylene.
Judith Enck, a former E.P.A. official and the founder of Beyond Plastics, notes that while recycling centers can accept all kinds of plastic, sorting the myriad types and then cleaning and refashioning each into new materials is a different matter. Contrary to the plastics industry's claims, she argues that no amount of money could meaningfully expand plastic recycling beyond No. 1 and No. 2 bottles and jugs. "Plastic recycling only exists in the minds of public relations agencies that are promoting plastics," she said.
One reason: chemistry. Unlike paper, glass or aluminum, plastics are incredibly diverse. Each type of plastic has its own mix of resins, colors and toxic chemicals. A hard-plastic orange laundry detergent jug and a clear squeezable ketchup bottle "can never get recycled together," Ms. Enck said, because the resulting material would be useless. Even green No. 1 bottles cannot be recycled with clear No. 1 bottles.
Jeff Donlevy, general manager of Ming's Recycling in Hayward, Calif., compared plastic to cheese: Although most cheeses are made from milk, as most plastics are made from fossil fuels, he said, "you just can't melt all that cheese down again and recreate a new cheese that somebody likes."
Even when plastic can be reprocessed, it is more expensive than making it new. With new plastic, Mr. Donlevy explained, you don't have to deal with "paper or glass shards or dirt or food waste" or other contaminants. So there's little incentive for manufacturers to stop using cheap virgin plastic.
Ms. Dell supports recycling No. 1 and No. 2 plastics and she would welcome the industry's help to improve their recycling rates, which hover at just 30 percent. As she put it, the companies could say: "1s and 2s bottles and jugs, that's it, that's all that's ever been recyclable. And now we're going to work on making that better."
"But they won't," Ms. Dell said. "They maintain that it's all recyclable, because why? The plastics industry wants to sell bags. They want to sell forks. They want to sell foam cups."
'We can make such progress'
Under California's new truth-in-labeling law, polypropylene -- and all other plastics -- will qualify as recyclable only if two criteria are met: 60 percent of Californians have access to a recycler that accepts and sorts the material, and 60 percent of the state's recyclers have access to a facility that reprocesses it.
The California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, or CalRecycle, is now studying which materials are picked up by recyclers -- and where they're ending up. Once the agency releases its findings next year, companies will have 18 months to change their labels. Manufacturers of single-use packaging and single-use food service products, like cups and utensils, will also face pressure from California's new extended producer responsibility law, which gives them until 2032 to make their products recyclable or compostable.
Because California is such a large part of the U.S. economy, the combined impact of these laws will probably be felt across the country, said Heidi Sanborn, who was chair of the recycling commission that encouraged them. Companies are "already calling and talking to packaging manufacturers, saying, 'Oh my gosh, I don't think No. 6 is going to work anymore,"' she said. "And they're not going to do that just for California."
The plastics industry could certainly push back against CalRecycle's findings. But if the California law works as Ms. Dell hopes, she said, manufacturers will be forced to shift to materials that are reusable or actually recyclable. She's a fan of paper because its production isn't the result of fossil fuel extraction, because it can be composted or recycled, and because to her knowledge, she said, "a paper straw has never killed a sea turtle." Ms. Dell pointed out that Healthy Choice already offers some frozen meals in paper bowls, and that Starbucks uses paper to-go lids in France, which banned single-use plastic cups and plates in 2016.
"We can make such progress," she said, "once we get past this idea that single-use plastics could someday be recyclable."

Full text: Boarding a bus with full hands, a compliment corrected and more reader tales of New York City in this week's Metropolitan Diary.
Suitcase and Trombone
Dear Diary:
Returning from a trip when I was a poor college student living on the Upper West Side, I decided to take mass transit home from the airport.
Boarding a bus for the last leg of the trip home, which in those days was a two-hour ordeal, I struggled my way on, dragging my suitcase and trombone.
A man sitting near the door lost his patience and began to yell at me for holding up the bus. Embarrassment washed over me as I continued to struggle.
Suddenly, I heard a woman a few seats away yell out in a commanding voice.
"You leave her alone!" she bellowed.
I soon found a seat.

Great Color
Dear Diary:
I was on my way to meet a friend for dinner. I was wearing a loose blouse of a pinkish hue.
When I got on the elevator in my Downtown Brooklyn building, there was a woman there whom I didn't know but recognized as a fellow tenant.
"That color's great on you," she said. "It matches your lipstick."
"I'm not wearing lipstick," I said.
"Well," she replied, "your lips are salmon."
-- June Duffy
Blue Soccer Ball
Dear Diary:
During an early morning walk in Brooklyn Bridge Park with my daughter Ella, I spotted a blue soccer ball on the sidewalk adjacent to the turf fields on Pier 5.
A quick look around the area did not reveal any players who might have kicked a ball so far out of bounds. Ella asked if we could keep the ball and, after a brief moral dilemma, I picked it up and brought it with us.
When we got home, I cleaned the ball with a wipe in the kitchen sink. When I did, I discovered a name and number in faded marker. I texted the number, explained that we had found the ball and offered to return it.
"Keep it," the reply text said. "My kids lost that ball seven years ago at that field. They're all grown up and no longer need it. I hope your daughter enjoys it as much as they did."
-- Brian Price
South Beach Summer
Dear Diary:
Every summer, I looked forward to swimming at South Beach on Staten Island.
My Aunt Emma packed salami sandwiches, cans of Coke wrapped in aluminum foil and a sleeve of store-bought cookies. When it came time to eat, the sandwiches inevitably had a special crunch thanks to stray grains of sand.
Aunt Emma would throw out the beach blanket, unfold a few chairs, set up the umbrella and slather me with sunscreen.
The waves and undertow in the bay were strong. Why should I worry? I had my intermediate swimming card from the Red Cross, which I had earned as a C.Y.O. day camper.
At 12 years old, I thought I looked great in the fashionable two-piece bathing suit I had recently bought. How I wished a boy would notice me.
Did I listen to my aunt and stay near the shore and in front of the lifeguard stand?
Of course not, and a boy did notice me: The lifeguard jumped in when I was hit by a series of waves and drifted out to deeper water.
-- Judith Gropp
Lost Mandolin
Dear Diary:
In winter 2008, I was an aspiring musician living in Inwood after graduating from college, cutting my teeth in the New York City music scene.
One night after a late gig in the East Village, I splurged on a cab ride home with my violin and mandolin in tow.
Contrary to my usual habit, I pocketed the taxi receipt while exiting the cab and then promptly stumbled into bed.
Panic set in the next morning when I realized my mandolin had not made it out of the cab. Frantic, I called 311.
"I left my mandolin in a cab, and I don't know how to get it back," I told the nice woman who took my call.
"Sure," she said. "I can help you with that, but what's a mandolin?"
Stunned by the question, I explained that it was like a small version of a guitar but with eight strings.
Because I had saved the receipt with the taxi's medallion number, the woman was able to find the cab company's telephone number. I called immediately.
"Last night I left mandolin in one of your cabs," I said. "Can you help me?"
"Maybe, but what's a mandolin?" the person on the other end of the line asked.
Shocked to hear this question again, I repeated my abbreviated description of the centuries-old instrument. I was transferred to a supervisor, who asked the same question: "What's a mandolin?"
Eventually, I was given the cabby's personal cellphone. This time, I was ready with a revised introduction when I reached him.
"I left an instrument in your cab last night," I explained, "It's like a small guitar, only with eight strings, and is in a soft black case."
"Yes, yes," the cabby said. "I have your mandolin right here. If you give me an address, I will drive her over to you."

Where Young Britons Underwrite a 'Tourism of Excess': [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: On the front lines of a low-cost resort, Spanish residents complain that U.K. visitors drink too much and don't spend enough.
A fit and ruddy 19-year-old with blond hair and a sheepish smile, James Henderson is tanning on a beach in Magaluf, a town on the Spanish island Mallorca that has long been the destination of choice for young Britons in search of a boozy holiday in the sun. Asked to recount the revelry of the day before, he grins like a man who has just completed a decathlon and is pretty psyched about his performance.
There was a few hours of "pre-drinking," as he put it, at his hotel, then on to Punta Ballena, a crammed and gritty strip of pubs, tattoo parlors and lap dance emporiums that bursts with action until dawn every summer day. By the time he and his vacation buddy headed to bed, at 3 a.m., they had each knocked back roughly 20 drinks over the course of 15 hours.
"I had a bit of a strange taste in my mouth this morning," Mr. Henderson said, proudly describing the minimal aftereffects of this marathon, "but nothing too bad."
Every summer, Magaluf crawls with young British people in search of a bacchanalia, and they find one in what is essentially a slab of the United Kingdom set in the Mediterranean, except seedier than anything in the dingiest corners of London. There are also G-rated home comforts, like kebab shops, Yorkshire pudding and pubs, all at strikingly affordable prices.
The annual swarm is both a financial boon and a curse. The Britons here are not the hooligans who occasionally get blanket bans from foreign cities hosting U.K. soccer teams for fear of violent clashes. All of the fun in Magaluf gets posted to Instagram, which means it tends to be more photogenic than destructive.
But young British travelers are notorious for drinking a lot and spending little, and local reaction to the hard partying herd in Magaluf is split between come hithers (from hotel and bar owners) and go yons (from residents).
It's a source of continuing tension, not just here but on other islands and in the country's most beloved cities, including Barcelona and Madrid. Tourism accounts for more than 10 percent of Spain's annual gross domestic product, the European Commission reports, and the United Kingdom provides the largest chunk of that windfall. More than 18 million British people visited Spain in 2019, about one-quarter of the total population, according to U.K. government statistics.
Spanish officials have already predicted that 2023 will break records.
"We don't have factories here," said Pepe Carbonell, an owner of Bondi Beach, a bar and restaurant in Magaluf. "We live off tourists, and the only bad customers are the ones who don't come to Mallorca."
Many tipple in moderation and spend plenty. But places like Magaluf are hotbeds of what is known here as the "tourism of excess." The most notorious section of all is Punta Ballena, which has generated tales of hedonism for more than a generation.
Sexual assault is sadly common. There have also been fights and plenty of what is known as "balconying," the practice of leaping from a balcony onto another balcony or into a swimming pool. (It's popular enough that the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office published a warning against it.) Public nudity is so prevalent on this strip that signs here state, "Wear no clothes on the street, penalty 400 euros."
"There are residents who live here, work here, take their kids to school here, and they have to see drunk people all the time, drugs, prostitution," said Margalida Ramis, campaigner for GOB, a conservation nonprofit. "Living in this reality is like living in hell if you want a normal life."
Typically, officials here broach the topic of low-end British tourism diplomatically, aware that tastes change and that if young people abandon places like Magaluf, the economic consequences will be severe. The future looks precarious. Like much of continental Europe, Spain has been sweltering in record heat this summer, and U.K. tabloids have suggested that tourists are choosing more temperate climates, even if they offer a fraction of the excitement.
"Costa Del Dull," read a mid-August headline in The Daily Star, a London-based newspaper, riffing on the name of a southern coastal area of Spain, above a photograph of Hercule Poirot, the fictional Belgian detective. "Tourists swap traditional holiday favorites for boring Belgium to beat global warming crisis."
Some Spanish politicians are too annoyed by the putative boorish behavior of the British tourists to exercise restraint.
"We have areas of our islands that are clearly marked by the tourism of excess," Iago Negueruela, counselor of tourism of the Balearic government, which includes Mallorca, told elDiario.es, a Spanish digital newspaper. "That is what does not have to come back, and we will do everything possible so that it does not."
Such sentiments led to a decree, passed by the regional government in January 2022, to curtail shenanigans in what were officially labeled red zones on three islands, including Mallorca. Party boats -- a cruise with a D.J. for a fixed price and an open bar -- were banned. So were bikini-clad women dancing in the windows of bars. Two-for-one drink specials were prohibited, too.
The goal was to increase the amount of luxury tourism, and some pricier hotels have popped up at safe distances from Punta Ballena. But if Magaluf is any indication, once a place is renowned for low-end getaways, the label is hard to shed. Plenty of vendors still cater to the bargain hunters. Mr. Henderson, for instance, bought a round-trip flight and three nights at a hotel for about $ 600, a price that included three meals, with three drinks at both lunch and dinner.
"And a shuttle to the airport is 10 pounds," Mr. Henderson's friend, Toby Euston, 18, said. "That's why people come here. It's cheap, and there's nice weather."
Deals on alcohol remain ubiquitous on the strip. On a recent Tuesday, around 1 a.m., the pavement was chockablock with tourists and what are known here as "reps." These are bar employees whose job is to stand in the middle of the street and rope in passers-by.
It gives the place the feeling of a noisy, roiling bazaar where the only commodity for sale is liquor. A typical pitch: a triple shot and two more shots for seven euros. Every bar has a variation of this budget beverage offer. And music. A bunch of bars offer "silent disco," where people listen and dance to music while wearing headphones.
The entire scene is familiar to Daniel Briggs, an ethnographer from Northumbria University in England, who spent four summers studying young British people in Magaluf for research underwritten by the Foreign Office, the arm of the U.K. government that safeguards citizens abroad. He saw plenty of fights and more than a few accidents that led to hospitalizations.
To him, the question of why British youngsters overindulge in Magaluf isn't a mystery. They are generally taking their first vacation without parents, and that creates a sense that everyone is off the leash. And drinking has been central to British culture for centuries. Businesses here understand that, Professor Briggs said. Magaluf is carefully designed to exploit its core demographic.
"Bar owners know they've got a group of people who are young and ready to drink, and they've presented all sorts of options for them that encourages the worst behavior," he said. "Obviously, this is a business."
Many Britons here know that their reputation for unhinged behavior precedes them. Few seem to mind.
"I think British people don't really care," said Bella Fisher, a 21-year-old from Britain, who was walking near the beach with a friend. "They have, like, no standards. Like, they don't really care about anything."
But aren't British people renowned for their reserve?
"Until you get to Magaluf," she said.
In other countries, officials have explicitly tried to wave away British tourists. Amsterdam, for instance, started an online campaign in March that showed public-service ads to anyone searching the internet for terms like "pub crawl Amsterdam."
"Coming to Amsterdam for a messy night?" read text in one video showing a man being arrested. "Stay away."
In Spain, anger about the British is more likely to come from residents than government officials. There's a derogatory word for visitors from Britain -- guiri. It's a shorthand for any British person behaving in what is regarded as a stereotypically British way -- namely, drinking too much, fighting, ignoring social norms like stopping at traffic lights, and spending very little money.
Occasionally, the anger bubbles into something closer to rage. "Tourists go home," someone spray painted not long ago on a hotel in Mallorca. In some cities, posters that ooze sarcasm have been put up that encourage balconying. One uses an image of a stick figure tripping off a balcony; underneath is text ticking through the benefits of this hazardous activity.
"Prevents gentrification," the poster reads, "reduces the risk of heart disease, is LOTS of fun."
Some club and bar owners in Magaluf detect an anti-British bias in laws designed to curtail the tourism of excess. Gerard Pietro, owner of Capitol Bar -- which features a large pink neon sign that reads "Please don't do coke in the bathroom" -- says Magaluf should embrace its image and the people drawn to it.
"If I could get 50 customers a night who only bought Dom Pérignon, I'd be the happiest owner in the world, but that is not what happens here," he said. "We have young people, and they have the right to party."
During a recent daytime walk through the strip, Professor Briggs said the place looked pretty much the same as when he last spent a summer here, in 2019. He walked past a fish-and-chips spot called the Chippy, and pubs with distinctly British names, like the Red Lion. He stopped briefly at a bar, the Dirty Dog, after spotting a young man seated in a chair and apparently passed out on the patio. A couple of friends hovered nearby, not especially concerned.
"Is he all right?" asked Professor Briggs.
"He's fine," a friend said.
"How long you guys staying for?" Professor Briggs asked.
"Forever," came the reply.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Former President Donald J. Trump won't be on the stage in Milwaukee, but his rivals still need to make a case to be the alternative.
Eight candidates will appear onstage for the first Republican debate on Wednesday. But much of the focus will be on one person who won't be there, Donald J. Trump.
The dynamic has left his opponents preparing for an unusual scenario: debating among themselves while the front-runner with a commanding lead is entirely absent.
Still, for Mr. Trump's rivals, the debate provides the biggest audience of the race to date, and their first chance to not only make an impression but to make the race a true contest.
Senator Mitt Romney, a Republican who ran the presidential debate gantlet twice and is his party's most prominent elected Trump antagonist, offered this advice: "The key for them is not to focus on each other but the person who's at the top. You gotta punch up."
Yet even the most viral moment could quickly be swept away in a wave of Trump-driven news. "In 99 out of 100 futures," said Newt Gingrich, the former Republican presidential candidate and House speaker, "Donald Trump is the Republican nominee and he doesn't even breathe heavy."
But the eight candidates have a shot to present Republican voters with an alternative. How they make their case could make the 2024 primary a contest and not a coronation.
Here are nine things that are likely to define the debate.

How present is Trump, even when he's absent?
A significant portion of the debate will most likely revolve around Mr. Trump, his criminal indictments, his continued questioning of the 2020 election and his responsibility for the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. While the candidates have been asked about those issues frequently, a debate allows for follow-up questions -- heightening the possibly of a misstep.
Mr. Trump will still put his mark on the moment. He has announced plans to try to upstage the debate with the release of a recorded online interview with the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.
And on Thursday, the former president plans to surrender to the authorities in Atlanta to face charges in the case accusing him of election interference, an appearance likely to dominate the news cycle and cut into any bounce his rivals hope to receive from the debate.
Can DeSantis reset?
Perhaps the candidate with the most at stake on Wednesday is Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida. The DeSantis team expects him to be the target of attacks. "The other candidates, a lot of them don't really say much about Donald Trump, and they focus more on me," Mr. DeSantis said on Fox News Radio last week.
Mr. DeSantis is viewed as Mr. Trump's strongest challenger, but he has faced weeks of bad press, campaign shake-ups and sinking poll numbers -- in what can be a self-reinforcing downward cycle. The debate is his opportunity to change the narrative.
But that strategy was complicated last week when a series of documents and a debate strategy memo were published on the website of a firm associated with the super PAC that has taken over some of the basic elements of Mr. DeSantis's presidential campaign.
The strategy memo outlined "four basic must-dos" for the governor to parry away the attacks, including going after Vivek Ramaswamy, the entrepreneur and author who has gained ground in recent weeks, and defending Mr. Trump in the face of attacks from Chris Christie, who has seized the role of chief Trump antagonist in the race.
The release puts Mr. DeSantis in a bind. If he punts on those attacks, he could miss the opportunity to undercut key rivals. If he follows through, he may look inauthentic or even like a puppet.
Can Pence make Republicans reconsider?
In mock debate sessions, Mike Pence, Mr. Trump's vice president for four years, has prepared to contrast his staunch opposition to abortion, support for Ukraine and his focus on economic growth with the other candidates on the stage. Yet there's one issue that some of his advisers believe he must address to pull out of single digits in polling: his role certifying the 2020 election. The issue has dogged Mr. Pence, who has been criticized by Mr. Trump's supporters and labeled a traitor.
The debate, his team hopes, will still give Mr. Pence a bigger stage to make the case that he often does on the trail -- that he was just following his constitutional duty on Jan. 6.
Can Ramaswamy live up to the hype?
Mr. Ramaswamy, a wealthy entrepreneur and political novice, has gained traction by wooing MAGA supporters who want a next-generation version of Mr. Trump. He has taken a series of hard-right positions and has said Mr. Trump's "America First" agenda does not go far enough.
Mr. Ramaswamy has taken a more informal approach to preparing for the debate, holding conversations on policy with advisers as he travels the country aggressively, visiting nine states in the last week. A 38-year-old Harvard graduate, Mr. Ramaswamy has focused on studying foreign policy in particular. Victoria Coates, a former Trump administration official, has been among those giving him briefings, according to a campaign adviser. He prefers less structured sessions that don't feel overly produced, the adviser said.
Many far more politically experienced contenders have met their end under the bright lights of the debate stage. Can Mr. Ramaswamy's performance match his bluster?
How do policy differences shape the debate?
Two issues have divided the Republican field more than any others: abortion rights and support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. The Ukraine war has exposed a rift between the foreign policy hawks and the anti-interventionist wing of the party.
On abortion rights, an issue that has powered Democratic victories since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, Republicans have struggled to unify around a central position. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina says he will fight for a 15-week federal ban, Mr. Pence has expressed support for a six-week ban and Mr. Christie says the issue should be left to each individual state.
Mr. Pence, Mr. Scott and Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador under Mr. Trump, plan to highlight these differences, seeing an opportunity to win support among different party factions. How Republican voters respond will offer some early clues into the ideological future of the party, particularly in a post-Trump era.
Will Christie turn his firepower on DeSantis?
Aside from Mr. Trump, Mr. Christie is the most experienced debater in the field, with a knack for landing memorable attacks. He participated in eight face-offs during the 2016 election, and helped coach Mr. Trump for his presidential debates in 2020.
So far, he has focused much of his firepower on Mr. Trump -- in a candidacy that some rivals see largely as a kamikaze mission to prevent the former president from recapturing the nomination. The debate offers Mr. Christie an opportunity to take aim at those aligned with Trumpism, even if they are opposed to Mr. Trump. In recent days, he has signaled that such attacks could be coming, particularly against Mr. DeSantis and his claims that he is the most electable in the field.
"If you like Coca-Cola and Coke comes out with New Coke, and Coke is still available, well, you're going to buy Coke because what do you need New Coke for?" he said in a recent town hall in New Hampshire, arguing that Republicans needed a truer alternative to Mr. Trump than Mr. DeSantis. "Ron DeSantis is New Coke."
Can Scott stay a happy warrior?
The senator from South Carolina has campaigned across the country with an upbeat, future-focused message that leans heavily on his compelling personal story. There has been some evidence it's working: In recent weeks, his standing has crept up steadily in polls.
But while Mr. Scott has been gaining ground, he remains mired in single digits in most early-state polling. The debate is a chance for him to get a bounce. But will a positive message break through in a debate that could easily become a referendum on Mr. Trump and the past election?
Can Haley make it happen?
Ms. Haley, a former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador, entered the race in February, before any other candidate aside from Mr. Trump. She has campaigned at a grueling pace through Iowa and New Hampshire. But so far, she has little to show for her efforts. Her poll numbers have barely moved. And Mr. Scott, her home state rival, has surpassed her in both early-voting states.
Ms. Haley has urged voters not to count her out in not-so-subtle ways, showing up at the Iowa State Fair in a shirt that read, "Underestimate me. That'll be fun." Yet primary voters have expressed little interest in the lone woman in the Republican race.
Aides say she views the debate as the kickoff to the fall season of the campaign, when voters will start tuning into the primary race. But can she can make them pay attention?
How will lower-tier candidates introduce themselves?
Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota went to great lengths to qualify for the debate stage, at one point even offering $ 20 gift cards in exchange for $ 1 donations. But so far, the billionaire former software executive has yet to break 3 percent in Iowa. The issue, Mr. Burgum and his team argue, is largely one of familiarity. The debate offers Mr. Burgum his biggest -- and possibly only -- chance to make his pitch. "The important part was making the debate," he said in a brief interview in Iowa.
Former Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas faces a similar need to introduce himself to voters. He said the best advice he received for the big night was blunt: "Don't make it boring."
For his part, Mr. Burgum is not placing a lot of pressure on his performance on Wednesday night. "For us, we don't have to hit home runs, grand slams, any of that stuff," he said. "We're just on the stage with everybody else, being ourselves."

Full text: AMID THE STAID and stately stone and brick homes along the north side of St. Louis's Forest Park sits one house that's impossible to miss. As a child, the 48-year-old artist Katherine Bernhardt, who grew up a couple of miles away in Clayton, would marvel at the boxy, three-story structure -- a commingling of mostly rectangular forms and cutouts, with a white plaster surface and a frame that stretches past the living quarters -- through the window of her parents' minivan as they drove past it. Four years ago, she and her now-12-year-old son, Khalifa, moved back to her hometown from New York, where she'd spent more than two decades, in part to be closer to her parents but also because she was seeking a change. On a whim, Bernhardt went online to see if the property was for sale; she was handed the keys six months later.
The 6,000-square-foot Smith House, as it's known, was designed by Gary Glenn, who studied architecture at nearby Washington University in the 1960s. While on military duty overseas, he visited famed Modernist sites, including the Bauhaus in Germany, and Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation apartment complex in Marseille, France; he later worked in the architect Arne Jacobsen's office in Copenhagen. Upon returning to St. Louis, Glenn bounced around a few different architecture firms before starting his own practice in 1979. One of his occasional collaborators was Marcia Smith, an interior designer and boutique owner with bold, contemporary tastes. In 1984, the two paired up to build Smith and her husband, Herb's, house; what they created was a sensation. The Smiths' daughter, Ashley Smith Baptiste, who was in high school when she moved in with her parents and older brother the following year, says her peers called it "the 'Miami Vice' house" (the music video for the rapper Murphy Lee's 2003 song "Hold Up," featuring Nelly, would be filmed there).
While the structure itself epitomized the International Style that Le Corbusier and others popularized in the 1920s and '30s, its interiors were decorated with various pieces produced for or in the playful style of the Memphis Group, the design collective founded in 1980 by the Italian architect Ettore Sottsass. By the time Bernhardt arrived, however -- the Smiths moved out in 2002 -- the neon address sign that had shone from the entryway was gone; the built-ins had been ripped out; a wall had been fitted to the zigzag spine of an open staircase to accommodate a large TV; and what had once been black, white or vibrant, such as a cylindrical tomato red range hood in the kitchen, had been replaced with shades of gray.
TODAY, AFTER A 17-month-long renovation that is still ongoing, Bernhardt seems like the inevitable occupant of the Smith House. There are strong similarities between the 44 or so Memphis pieces she sourced for the home -- from Masanori Umeda's Tawaraya, a semi-enclosed platform that looks like a boxing ring but is meant to be used for conversation or lounging, to Martine Bedin's Super lamp, with wheels like those on a toy car and exposed bulbs positioned as if on the curved back of a Stegosaurus -- and Bernhardt's own flamboyant paintings: joyful, slightly abstract takes on familiar objects and icons such as cigarettes, melon slices, toilet-paper rolls, Diet Coke cans, Doritos, Swatches, Bart Simpson, Miss Piggy and E.T. (Her most recent show, at David Zwirner in Hong Kong, consisted of re-creations of Pokémon cards.) Her aim is not to exalt the mundane to the level of high art but to make us see her subjects anew and, while she's at it, make us smile.
In this way, too, Bernhardt is Memphis-aligned. Sottsass's philosophy, as he made clear when he invited his designer friends over for what would be the group's first meeting (Bob Dylan's "Stuck Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues Again" was playing in the background), was to make radical furniture that could be mass-produced, in humble materials such as terrazzo and plastic laminate. And if neither he nor Memphis ever became household names in the United States, their influence is now indelible. Before Bernhardt had ever heard of Memphis (and before the group's Instagram-fueled revival), she was obsessed with Esprit, the clothing company whose 1980s designs evoked the Milan-based collective by way of California. Nowadays, she keeps a closet's worth of old Esprit pieces -- a shift with green and white stripes, a vest printed with multicolored ladybugs -- in a guest bedroom that's also home to a free-standing wardrobe modeled after one of Sottsass's Superboxes.
In fact, Bernhardt considers the whole house a container for the '80s. Upon entering the L-shaped structure, a visitor is confronted by a Sottsass floor lamp that looks a bit like the face of an insect and, just behind it, a Bernhardt painting of E.T. in the shower. To the left is the dining room, which, as in the Smiths' day, has black walls and an asymmetrical glass-topped bar cart by Javier Mariscal for Memphis. To the right is the living room, for which Bernhardt commissioned a replica of a wet bar that Marcia Smith had designed with Memphis laminate. The artist based the room's terrazzo floor -- speckled white squiggles against speckled black -- on a Marco Zanini drawing that appears on the cover of "Memphis: The New International Style" (1981). On the second floor, Bernhardt's bedroom (there are four in total) features a wavy-edged Ultrafragola mirror (Sottsass again); an attached bathroom tiled in a Southwestern motif; and a spiral staircase leading to the third-floor library, which is filled with books about Memphis. Keith Johnson, the primary North American dealer of Memphis pieces, thinks the house might be the most thorough and daring homage to the movement in the country.
But it isn't just a tribute. The '80s-era furnishings live alongside contemporary artworks by Katherine Bradford, Rafael Ferrer, Marcus Jahmal, Eddie Martinez, Zéh Palito, Mary Weatherford and others. Bernhardt also strayed from how the house first looked by making the kitchen, like that in her parents' home, mostly turquoise -- and, in a nod to both the Mexican architect Luis Barragán and the Pink Panther, another recurring figure in her work, painting the back of the house mostly electric pink.
The artist gets a clear view of those pink walls many evenings when, after coming home from her studio -- a former auto body repair shop in St. Louis's Midtown neighborhood -- she sits in the hot tub nestled inside the outdoor pool, which is surrounded by concrete slabs painted to create long lines of alternating hues: lavender and orange, black and green, red and brown. On the day that Glenn came over to see what Bernhardt had done with the place (he approved), she told him that a pair of ducks had also started frequenting the pool area. "Maybe," he said, "they like the colors."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Pharrell Williams -- the clothing designer who succeeded Virgil Abloh in February 2023, just over a year after his death, as Louis Vuitton's men's creative director; the Grammy-winning record producer behind such pop masterpieces as Justin Timberlake's "Justified" (2002) and Clipse's "Hell Hath No Fury" (2006); the musician and performer who in conversation casually refers to the French electronic duo Daft Punk as "the robots" and Karl Lagerfeld as "Karl" -- doesn't like talking about himself. "This is absolutely Dante's 'Inferno,"' he said over the phone this past June, a few days after lighting up Paris's Pont Neuf with his spectacular debut for the French fashion house. At one point, it seemed like he might give up on the conversation altogether. "This is straight up like voice mail syndrome," he said. "I mean, do you like listening to yourself on voice mail?"
Williams, 50, was raised in Virginia Beach by his father, Pharaoh, a handyman, and his mother, Carolyn, a teacher. It was there that he met numerous lifelong collaborators, including Chad Hugo, his producing partner in the Neptunes, a duo as important to the sound of hip-hop over the past 30 years as the Funk Brothers were to Motown in the 1960s. A dedicated polymath who shifts between styles, genres and media, Williams is his best, most creative self in the presence of water. He grew up in a housing project called Atlantis, right by the beach; today, he holds an annual music and art festival in Virginia Beach called Something in the Water. And when he's not in Miami on Biscayne Bay, he spends his time in Paris, where he has a music studio at the LVMH headquarters overlooking the Seine.
At top: "This was taken in Los Angeles last year, a few months before the Louis Vuitton announcement. Being a producer and a creative director are similar. I can go from apparel to drums, from trunks to melodies. Within my design studio, I have a section allocated to music, so I go back and forth all day."
Left and right: "I wanted to work with [the American artist] Henry Taylor [whose paintings, one of which is shown here, were embroidered onto garments and bags from Williams's first collection for Louis Vuitton]. It's not lost on me that this appointment was given to another Black man from America. This is pivotal for us, you know, after Virgil, our brother who's gone back up to the stars. I think it's important that we continue to tell interesting stories. I don't have an agenda -- I am the agenda. I want not only people who look like me but people who don't look like me to be inspired by this moment. And working with an artist like Henry Taylor helps tell that story."
Left: "This was taken at a Chanel show in Africa last year. [Williams was a brand ambassador from 2014 to 2022.] We went to Dakar, Senegal, and I had on a fresh pair of [Adidas] Sambas. Years ago, I'd asked Karl [Lagerfeld, Chanel's longtime creative director who died in 2019] to take the house to Africa, and he said we would get to it, but he passed before we got a chance to."
Center: "My oldest son [Rocket, pictured here with Williams at Disney World in 2012] makes beats. We [Pharrell and his wife, the model and fashion designer Helen Williams] also have triplets. It's a triple handful. We say it's beautifully intense and intensely beautiful."
Right: "We turned a house in Miami into a studio. I have no idea [when we set it up], but it's been a couple of years. I'm terrible with chronology: I live in the moment, but I process things in the future and I get lost in the past. In Miami, it's all about the weather and the humidity. It's always been very inspiring to me. It's fun to record there on the water, which sounds like a flex, but it's really not."
Left: "With this Vuitton appointment, it's like I'm a perpetual student. If I'm the king of anything, it's the king of being a pupil. I knew I wanted to work on Damier [the brand's signature checkerboard pattern]. I've always loved pixelated camo, so we did it with Damier, leveling it up, and that's how we got Damouflage [pictured here on a model during a fitting earlier this year]. Being surrounded by so many talented people is the best. I mean, I'm an Aries, so I've always been superimpulsive. But without the resources and the people, I'd be just like every other person with a great idea."
Center: "As a kid, I listened to a lot of records my aunt would play in her house. Parliament-Funkadelic had songs that blew my mind. I also think [Kraftwerk's sixth studio album] 'Trans-Europe Express' (1977) happened around that time. Atlantis was like this neighborhood in a bubble. It's where music was everything and, when certain songs came on, it was like a musical happening right there in front of you. You could either be a part of it or you could stand back and watch."
Right: "This picture was taken earlier this year at Le Café V [a Louis Vuitton cafe in Osaka]. Japan is my favorite place. On my 50th orbit, I had a birthday party organized by [the Tokyo-based artistic director of Kenzo and hip-hop producer] Nigo. One of the most amazing gifts is his presence in my life. Twenty years ago, I needed to go to Japan to record something, so Nigo arranged for me to come to his studio, which is basically a compound on five floors of a building. One floor is a showroom, one is a photo studio, another is a recording studio, and I was like, 'Wow, this guy lives what's in his head.' That changed me. I was so used to bragging because that was the world I came from. And then I met Nigo, who barely said anything. He didn't have to. Humility is in the Tokyo air like the humidity in Virginia."
Left: "I think this picture is from around 1976, so when I was 3 years old. I'm the third of eight kids -- two sisters and five brothers. I want to say 'Star Wars' (1977) came out around then. I just remember being back in the Atlantis apartments in Virginia Beach. I didn't know life was as hard as it was, because it was fun to me."
Center: "My favorite cartoon as a kid was 'Jabberjaw' (1976), and the band he played in was called the Neptunes. So that's where the name [of his songwriting and production duo with Chad Hugo] came from."
Right: "I love watching movies to escape. But the funny thing is, I couldn't tell you from what. My favorite movie is 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' (1977). I relate to Richard Dreyfuss's character and the alien."

If there is anywhere in the country primed to welcome the clean energy transition, it is Penobscot Bay in Maine. Electricity prices there are high and volatile. The ocean waters are warming fast, threatening the lobster fishery. Miles offshore, winds blow strong enough to heat every home and power every car in the state.
For more than 15 years, researchers at the University of Maine have been honing scale models of floating wind turbines inspired by oil rigs. They are now confident they can mass-produce turbine blades the length of football fields and float them miles into the ocean. It is the kind of breakthrough in clean energy technology that is allowing a much faster transition to renewables than many believed possible, aided by state officials eager to pioneer a floating wind industry.
One key to harnessing that wind lies at the end of a causeway jutting into the bay, on a mostly undeveloped island where eagles fish offshore and people walk in the quiet shade. Many officials see this spot, known as Sears Island, as the ideal site to build and launch a flotilla of turbines that could significantly lessen Maine’s reliance on fossil fuels.
Standing in their way are environmental groups and local residents, all of whom are committed to a clean energy future and worried about the rapid warming of the Earth. Still, they want the state to pick a different site for its so-called wind port, citing the tranquility of Sears Island and its popularity and accessibility as a recreation destination.
On a recent summer morning one conservationist against the plan, Scott Dickerson, sat on a picnic bench and predicted environmental groups would sue to thwart development of the island, as they had many times in the past.
“And that, as you can imagine, is going to run the clock,” he said, costing the state valuable time that could be saved by looking elsewhere.
After years of fits and starts, the transition to renewable energy like wind and solar power is finally shifting into full gear in many parts of the world, including the United States, which has been buoyed by massive new subsidies from the Biden administration. But around the country, the effort is being slowed by a host of logistical, political and economic challenges.
Breaks in supply chains have stalled big projects. Historically low unemployment makes it hard to hire workers to build or install new turbines or solar panels. Shortcomings in the power grid can block newly generated electricity from reaching customers. Federal, state and local regulations, including often byzantine permitting requirements, threaten to delay some construction for years. So do the court battles that almost inevitably follow those permitting decisions.
These problems are not unique to the United States. In Europe, orders for new turbines dropped unexpectedly last year as developers struggled with inflation and sluggish permitting. In parts of China, a growing fraction of electricity from turbines and solar panels is being wasted because the grid lacks capacity. In Australia, clean energy companies have complained about a shortage of skilled workers.
At the same time, it tends to take longer to build solar arrays, wind farms, car chargers and transmission lines in the United States than in China, India and Europe, a recent analysis by the International Energy Agency found.
But no hurdle to a clean energy transition at the speed and scale scientists say is needed to avert catastrophic warming is easier to see than the growing local backlash to large-scale wind and solar projects, like the one roiling Sears Island.
The problem boils down to this: If lawmakers want to ramp up renewables as fast and cheaply as possible, they’ll need to bulldoze or build over some places that people treasure.
While Americans broadly support renewable energy, polls show, they are less enthusiastic about having it in their backyard. One survey from 2021 found that only 24% of Americans were willing to live within 1 mile of a solar farm; the number dropped to 17% for wind farms.
Such resistance is often rooted in anxieties about broader social and economic change in communities where families have lived for generations. But in some cases, like lawsuits trying to stop wind farm development off Massachusetts, groups with funding from fossil fuel interests have stoked fear. Those efforts are their own sort of obstacle to renewables: an attempt by incumbent energy players to protect their market share, even if the economics have turned against them.
A recent analysis found that it would cost less for electric utilities to build new wind and solar farms than to operate most of the existing coal-fired power plants — a stunning shift from 15 years ago, when burning coal was the cheapest way to make electricity.
But after years of rapid growth, installations of wind, solar and batteries slowed by 15% last year, according to the American Clean Power Association, a trade group.
“There’s a lot of capital ready to flow,” said Gregory Wetstone, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, another trade group. “But to get these projects going, you need to get them permitted, you need to get them connected to the grid, you need workers, you need access to supply chains. All of that can still be quite difficult.”
In Maine, many of those challenges are concentrated at one choke point: where to put a new wind port, which state officials have not decided on.
Offshore turbines need a large slab of land where they can be built and launched to sea. That site must connect to highways, to truck in materials, but also sit beside deep water.
The state’s two main contenders are in Searsport, about 30 miles south of Bangor.
One site is an industrial area, Mack Point, clearly visible from Sears Island. It is the spot many locals and conservationists prefer. The company that owns it says it could be easily converted to build and ship offshore turbines.
But some officials have warned that it could be difficult for Mack Point to secure needed permits from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies in order to dredge the bay and build new port facilities.
In Searsport, many residents fear that state officials will bypass Mack Point, which sits on private land and would need to be leased for millions of dollars a year — costs that would probably be passed on to utility customers.
Sears Island, in contrast, is owned by the state. Under a previous agreement with conservation groups, two-thirds of its woods and beaches are to be a nature preserve. The other third is zoned for a port.
Supporters of choosing the island site include Habib Dagher, a godfather of Maine’s offshore wind efforts and the founding executive director of the University of Maine’s Advanced Structures and Composites Center. He suggested it was worth trading the existing open space of the island for lower energy prices and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
“All of us would like to think that we can have renewable energy with zero impact on the environment — as you know, it’s not possible, right?” Dagher said in an interview at his wind lab. “So our goal, and our challenge, is: How do we minimize impact on environment as we embark on this transformational energy system?”
Conservation groups have fought development on Sears Island for decades, beating back a nuclear power plant, a gas import terminal and more. They reject the idea that they must lose that fight now — even as they lament climate change.
Rolf Olsen is a retired marketing executive and an avid day hiker. He kayaks and likes to swim in Penobscot Bay after mowing his lawn. He drives a white plug-in Toyota Prius and is vice president of a group called Friends of Sears Island, and he sat on a state advisory panel over where to locate the wind port, which he says should be at Mack Point.
On a recent hike, he described what a Sears Island port might look like, in place of the oaks and the birches.
“I have a picture in my mind’s eye. You know, it’s huge, flat, towering concrete and steel,” he said. “It saddens me.”
So, he added, does the warming of the planet.
“I have a granddaughter who’s 3. She’s going to have to live in a different world.”

Full text: During a summer of hellish wildfires, searing heat, boiling oceans and torrential storms, it's easy to lose sight of the real progress being made in the fight against climate change.
Wind and solar are rapidly displacing coal, oil and gas. Sales of electric vehicles and heat pumps are soaring. And a gusher of government subsidies and private capital is fueling record investment in clean energy.
Over the weekend, The Times published a big article I helped write and report that reveals just how fast the energy transition is moving. I encourage you to read the whole thing.
The article was the first in a three-part series looking at the startling advances already underway, the obstacles that remain, and the battle to win hearts and minds.
To report these sweeping stories, we fanned out across the country, reporting from Kansas, Maine, Wyoming, California and beyond. But for me, the heart of the story was in Tulsa, Okla.
Once known as the "Oil Capital of the World," Tulsa still embraces its history as an energy boomtown. The minor league baseball team is called the Drillers, and an enormous gold-colored statue of an oilman leaning on a derrick looms over the state fair grounds. While there's still plenty of money being made from oil and gas in Tulsa, the city is also on the vanguard of the nationwide embrace of clean energy -- one that is happening faster than most people realize.
Over a few hot days in June, I visited job sites where solar installers were affixing photovoltaic panels to residential roofs and chatted with homeowners who had installed heat pumps and were driving electric vehicles.
I went to a factory that is churning out electric school buses thanks to generous subsidies from the federal government and visited the Port of Tulsa, which is preparing to welcome a $ 1 billion solar panel factory.
I rode an electric passenger bus operated by the city and zipped around downtown on electric scooters. I plugged in an electric Ford F-150 Lightning at a charging station operated by a local company. And before I left, I stopped by the University of Tulsa's School of Petroleum Engineering and met with professors working on carbon capture technology.
It was a revealing trip that showed me just how quickly the United States is pivoting away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy -- even in the historic heart of oil country. And it's particularly apt on the first anniversary of the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which is proving to be much more popular, and expensive, than expected.
I hope you'll take some time to read the full article. Tomorrow, I'll tell you about the work of my colleagues who were looking into two big questions: what are the obstacles preventing broader adoption of clean energy, and how to persuade people to make the leap.

A Hollywood Ending Eludes a Landmark: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Since the November night in 1963 when the Cinerama Dome opened its doors with the premiere of "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World" -- drawing Milton Berle, Buddy Hackett and Ethel Merman to the sidewalks of Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood -- the theater, and the multiplex that later rose around it, has been a home for people who liked to watch movies and people who liked to make movies.
Its distinctive geodesic dome, memorialized by Quentin Tarantino in the 2019 film "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood," has become more retro than futuristic over the years, a reminder of a Technicolor past. Yet through it all, the complex known as the ArcLight Hollywood remained a cinephile favorite, with no commercials, no latecomers admitted and ushers who would, after introducing the upcoming show, promise to stay behind to make sure the sound and picture were "up to ArcLight standards."
But today the ArcLight Hollywood is closed, both a victim of the coronavirus pandemic and a symbol of a movie industry in turmoil, even in its own backyard.
"There was nothing like the ArcLight -- I was really surprised they closed," said Amy Aquino, an actor who played Lt. Grace Billets in the television show "Bosch" and who had been drawn by the theater's serious approach to moviegoing since seeing "Sideways" there in 2004.
Her husband, Drew McCoy, said he now worried every time he passed the abandoned complex. "It's too strange that a pre-eminent structure that was once killing it is sitting there like a white elephant," he said.
The shuttered complex -- its entrance marked by plywood boards instead of movie posters -- stands as a reminder of the great uncertainty that now shadows old-fashioned cinema in American culture. Dual strikes have shut down production. Competition from streaming services, as well as shortened attention spans in a smartphone era, has led movie theaters around the nation to shut their doors.
The record-shattering box office for "Barbie" and the strong showing for "Oppenheimer" this summer gave a beleaguered industry hope after what had been a long, slow decline in moviegoing, accelerated by the pandemic. But other big-budget would-be blockbusters have been humbled by soft ticket sales, and the lingering strike has prompted some studios to delay major releases. The fundamental challenges to theatergoing have not gone away, and the boarded-up ArcLight is a daily reminder of that.
"Times are sad," said Bill Counter, a cinema historian who has documented the history of the ArcLight. "The theaters that survive will be those that make filmgoing an event by offering the sort of amenities that made ArcLight a destination originally."
It is only fitting the ArcLight has become a Los Angeles mystery, the subject of speculation that befits a movie theater that was always more than just another neighborhood cinema.
When the company that owns the ArcLight, the Decurion Corp., applied for a liquor license last year, movie fans seized on even that slight bit of movement as a sign that coming attractions might not be far behind. And executives at Decurion, which closed 11 ArcLight theaters across the country as part of a bankruptcy reorganization, have assured theater preservation groups that they will not walk away from what was known as the ArcLight Hollywood. But it has remained closed.
"Everybody has been hoping it was on the verge of reopening," Counter said. "Periodically things leak out. You hear about an architecture firm. It would be lovely to think about reopening for its 60th anniversary, which would be November."
"Everyone loves it," he added. "Filmmakers want to go there. It will reopen. They are just taking their time."
But Decurion continues to offer little insight into its intentions. "Thank you for reaching out," Ted Mundorff, a senior executive with Decurion, said by email. "We are not commenting on the Hollywood property."
There has been some encouraging news recently for film enthusiasts in Los Angeles. The New Beverly Cinema, a revival movie house that Tarantino took over in 2014, reopened in June 2021 after being shut down because of Covid-19. Its motto: "All Shows Presented in Glorious 35 mm (unless noted in 16 mm)." Vidiots, the landmark store that closed in 2017 in Santa Monica, reopened in the old Eagle Theater in June, renting videos and showing a rich array of old movies. And a 12-screen multiplex opened this summer at Hollywood Park, across the way from the new SoFi Stadium in Inglewood.
The concern about the ArcLight's future is unfolding in a city where landmarks and institutions can disappear overnight in a burst of construction dust. Amoeba Music, a revered record store a block away from the ArcLight, recently bowed to the demands of a developer and abandoned its building for a new complex on Hollywood Boulevard. ("The building may be new, but Amoeba's personality shines throughout," its website promises.)
"People have every right to be cautious when something closes in L.A.," said Tiffany Nitsche, the president of the board of directors of the Los Angeles Historic Theater Foundation. "We lose things so fast."
The murkiness of the deliberations has fed the concern. "I don't know what they are doing," said Antonio Villaraigosa, the former Los Angeles mayor who "went all the time" when he lived 10 minutes away in the Hollywood Hills. "If they are bringing it back, I'd like to be a part of it. Why wouldn't we want to restore that beautiful place?"
The Cinerama Dome, a geodesic dome modeled after a Buckminster Fuller design, rises like a 70-foot-high golf ball along Sunset Boulevard. As an officially designated Los Angeles cultural monument, the Dome is protected, which means it would be difficult -- though not impossible -- to knock it down for, say, an office building.
"It's very iconic," said Linda Dishman, the president of the Los Angeles Conservancy.
In 2002, the Dome expanded with the addition of an adjacent three-level 14-screen multiplex. Those theaters in particular drew a discriminating audience who appreciated the top-of-the-line sound and picture (and were willing to pay the premium prices). It was rare to hear anyone talk once the lights down, much less spot anyone sneaking a text. The coming attractions before the feature film were kept relatively short, and never cluttered by on-screen advertisements for, say, Coca-Cola. It became a popular place for premieres.
Hugo Soto-Martinez, whose Los Angeles City Council district includes the ArcLight, said his constituents regularly press him on what was going on with the theater; he is as mystified as everyone else.
Nitsche said that for all the mystery, she remained certain the ArcLight would be back. "We've watched theaters struggle for the last two years," she said. "I'm not sure anyone is jumping to get back into that game."
"But I can't imagine the ArcLight not reopening," she said. " I just don't know when."

It was rare to hear anyone talk once the lights went down, much less spot anyone sneaking a text. The coming attractions before the feature film were kept relatively short, and never cluttered by on-screen advertisements for, say, Coca-Cola. It became a popular place for premieres.
Hugo Soto-Martinez, whose Los Angeles City Council district includes the ArcLight, said his constituents regularly press him on what is going on with the theater; he is as mystified as everyone else.
Nitsche, of the historic theater foundation, said that for all the mystery, she remained certain the ArcLight would be back. “We’ve watched theaters struggle for the last two years,” she said. “I’m not sure anyone is jumping to get back into that game.”
“But I can’t imagine the ArcLight not reopening,” she said. “ I just don’t know when.”

Full text: Summer is high season for the hot dog, from backyard grills to ballparks to the finest roadside joints. Across the United States, hot dogs exhibit a striking diversity that reflects the microclimates in which they've evolved ever since the 1860s, when an entrepreneurial immigrant introduced the species from Germany. Here we take a wide-ranging, but admittedly inexhaustive, look at some of the varieties you may encounter in the wild.
New York Dog
NATURAL HABITAT The Big Apple
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES All beef, with sauerkraut and spicy brown mustard
New York State is a epicenter of American hotdoggery, home to beloved hyperlocal wieners like Syracuse's Snappy Grillers, micro-regional variants like the three-inchers of Troy, and destination footlongs like those grilled over coals at Ted's in Buffalo. Still, New York City lays claim to the defining dogs: not the dirty-water type, but the all-beef franks puckering on the griddles at Nathan's Famous in Coney Island, pastrami-slinging delis and storefronts with "Papaya" in their names. Tomato-stained "onions in sauce" is a worthy condiment, but spicy brown mustard with either sauerkraut (for traditionalists) or relish (for swashbucklers) is the move. Tales are even told of those who take both.

Texas Tommy
NATURAL HABITAT The Delaware Valley, oddly
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES Bacon and cheese
In the grand tradition of misleading hot dog names, this mid-20th-century creation hails not from the Lone Star State but, reportedly, from Pottstown, Pa. It may have taken its name from a Ragtime dance that was as indecorous then as the topping combo may seem today. Now you can get one from Wilmington, Del. (at Johnnie's Dog House & Chicken Shack, it's bacon-wrapped in the original fashion), to Philadelphia (at Steve's Prince of Steaks, you'll find a split wiener topped with bacon strips and whiz). The region's other contender, a fried fish cake on a dog, doesn't stand a chance.
Slaw Dog
NATURAL HABITAT The South
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES The slaw
In West Virginia, which lays claim to masterminding the topping way back in the 1920s, it's often paired with hot dog sauce (or, as some might identify it, chili). In North Carolina, it could come piled on an electric-red, locally revered Bright Leaf dog. The dog is nearly vermilion at Nu-Way Weiners, a Macon, Ga., destination since 1916, where the slaw atop the chili is cold, creamy and finely chopped. So, too, is the topping at the Varsity in Atlanta, where it's a valid move to skip the chili and order an all-beef frank crowned with just slaw.
Puerto Rican-Style Dog
NATURAL HABITAT The island's many stands and carts
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES No topping spared
Puerto Rico is rich with carts selling hot dogs adorned in the Boricua style. These low-key setups belie the joys of this frank, which is decked out with some version of virtually every standard topping: Squirts of mustard, ketchup and cheese sauce join forces with layers of sauerkraut, onions and carne molida (ground beef cooked with sofrito that plays the role of chili). Finally, there are crunchy potato sticks, the crown that turns this variety into dog royalty.
The Sonoran
NATURAL HABITAT Arizona in general, Tucson in particular
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES The best kind of fusion
The name nods to the leading theory of its provenance: Sonora, the Mexican state just across the border. But spend enough time in metro Phoenix or Tucson and you'll see that this extravagant dog is Arizonan to the core. The "dogueros" who operate the mobile outfits (like El Sabroso in Phoenix) and griddles (Los Chipilones in Tucson) don't hold back. In a roll that clocks in somewhere between bolillo and bun, there are pinto beans, diced tomatoes and onions, as well as stripes of mustard, drizzles of green salsa and squiggles of mayo. Under there somewhere is a hot dog wrapped in bacon and on the side, a little gift -- a couple of charred yellow chiles.
The Ripper
NATURAL HABITAT North Jersey
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES Deep-fried perfection
The paradigmatic New Jersey dog is defined by its cooking method, a bath in hot oil that transforms a natural-casing frank into the blistered archetype of ugly-delicious. Some North Jersey legends specialize in the ultimate version: rippers. The default at Hiram's Roadstand in Fort Lee and an option at Rutt's Hut in Clifton, they are fried until they burst and new nooks and crags emerge to char as crisp as cracklings. Chili-cheese, relish and mustard are all welcome. A highly honorable mention goes to the Italian Dog, invented in Newark at the original Jimmy Buff's: Two links are fried, stuffed in "pizza bread" and buried under cooked peppers, onions and crispy potato.
New York System
NATURAL HABITAT Rhode Island, strangely
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES Meat sauce, strict parameters and a touch of flair
Don't let the "New York" fool you -- these are pure Rhode Island, and rival Chicago dogs in their particularity. The midcentury brainchild of the Original New York System restaurant, they are also called hot wieners, gaggers and Greek lobsters, though never hot dogs. At places that carry on the tradition, staffers deftly prepare them "on the arm," lining up steamed, slightly sweet buns from Homestead Baking Company on their forearms and filling them with wieners made from veal, beef and pork. They are then dressed with mustard, "meat sauce" (what an outsider might call chili), raw onions and a flurry of celery salt. That's "all the way," and with a glass of coffee milk on the side, it's the only way.
Chicago Dog
NATURAL HABITAT The Windy City and its environs
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES "The garden"
Regional hot dog tradition at its most precise, the Chicago dog is an improbable masterpiece, whether you're peacefully taking down a boiled version at Superdawg Drive-In or ordering a char dog while you get roasted by the staff at the Wiener's Circle. It's "dragged through the garden," which means topped with exactly seven items that doting partisans can rattle off without hesitation: yellow mustard, relish (customarily a neon green), chopped white onions, tomato slices, a pickle spear, pickled sport peppers and celery salt. The foundation beneath is also imperative: a natural casing, all beef (nearly always from the local wiener maestros at Vienna Beef), tucked inside a poppy-seed bun.
Half Smoke
NATURAL HABITAT Washington, D.C.
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES A special sausage
Underneath the blanket of saucy chili and beyond the chopped onions and yellow mustard that are vital to a Half Smoke served "all the way" is the signature sausage that defines this capital classic. While the smoky, slightly spicy pork-and-beef links were invented as breakfast fare at the Weenie Beenie, they are now available at establishments throughout the city. But no purveyor is more famous than Ben's Chili Bowl, the U Street monument to meat. Technically, its Half Smoke is more sausage than hot dog, but it's so good that we don't care.
Cheese Coney
NATURAL HABITAT The chili parlors of Cincinnati
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES The city's famous (or infamous) chili
This Midwestern standout wields a familiar trinity: chopped onion, a stripe of mustard, a sauce of finely ground beef. But it is then topped with a prodigal pile of shredded Cheddar. Adherents who haunt parlors like Skyline and Camp Washington scoff at the it's-not-chili complaints, celebrating the sauce's distinctive spicing of nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon -- and the miraculous merging of Mediterranean and Slavic flavors with early-20th-century American tastes. That said, they also take theirs on spaghetti, so the jury's still out.
Seattle Dog
NATURAL HABITAT The food carts of Seattle
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES Hot frank, cool cream cheese
Outsiders sometimes wince at the thought of Seattle Dogs. Even some locals consider them fit only for a post-boozing binge. Yet there they are, cream cheese-slathered buns hosting hot dogs. Lore has it that the creation is a good three decades old, invented by a bagel purveyor named Hadley Longe. He opened a bagel cart in Pioneer Square, and soon after began offering dogs served with a schmear on bialy rolls, begetting imitators galore who swapped in buns. Griddled onions -- possibly a nod to the onions on bialys -- complete the style.
Coneys
NATURAL HABITAT Michigan
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES Not just another chili dog with mustard and raw white onion
Coney Island is the name for the dogs, the whole category of restaurants that sell them, and the place that inspired their originator, a Greek immigrant (either Gust Keros or George Todoroff, depending on whom you ask) who passed through the hot dog hub of New York City on his way west. Michiganders differ, with Midwestern politeness, over Coney particulars: In Detroit, the Coney sauce at the stalwarts American Coney Island and Lafayette Coney Island has a fluidity that makes staining your shirt inevitable. In Flint, locals call the sauce "dry" as a compliment, while the city of Jackson has its own variation, with differences so subtle they're nearly undetectable by outsiders. Most everyone seems to agree on the supremacy of Koegel's brand dogs and the necessity of beef heart in the chili.
Bologna Dog
NATURAL HABITAT The Jewish delis of Baltimore
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES Beef two ways
The heyday of Baltimore's Jewish delis has passed, but the legacy lives on, at least at Attman's Deli, one of the last vestiges of East Lombard Street's Corned Beef Row, and the Essen Room in nearby Pikesville. Both still offer the duet of emulsified meats that's become known as Baltimore's hot dog. Slices of griddled beef bologna on an all-beef frank is a textural lark and, as the beloved local historian Gilbert Sandler noted "grease from the bologna mixes with the grease from the hot dog, and both find their way into the bread." What sounds like redundancy is actually profundity.
Polish Boy
NATURAL HABITAT Cleveland
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES Kielbasa à la barbecue
Long ago, Clevelanders said "Polish boy" and meant kielbasa, the garlicky smoked sausage beloved by the Polish immigrants who arrived in the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today the term refers to this sloppy sensation, a glorious fusion. Propelled by local Black-owned smoked-meat concerns like Virgil Whitmore Sr.'s Mt. Pleasant Bar-B-Q, cooks began to furnish the city's hallowed sausage with the toppings on hand: coleslaw, a pile of fries and plenty of barbecue sauce.
Reindeer Dog
NATURAL HABITAT Alaska
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES A delicately gamy link, Coca-Cola onions
In the summer of 1892, Capt. Michael Healy brought back the first reindeer from Siberia as a new food source for hungry Alaskans. That same summer, Nathan Handwerker (the founder of Nathan's Famous) was born. Coincidence? Well, yes. All the same, today Alaska's on-a-bun benefaction is a dog made with lean, delicately gamy reindeer. The consummate rendition comes from Yeti Dogs in Anchorage, where the link teams up with another Alaskan hot dog tradition: sautéed onions spiked with Coca-Cola.

Matildas Unite a Land Split, Culturally and Geographically, Over Footy: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The World Cup has added a new dimension to a national sporting conversation often dominated by the rivalry between rugby and Australian rules football.
Inside the vast sweep of the Melbourne Cricket Ground, almost nobody was paying attention to what was happening on the field. Those fans who remained in their seats were staring up at the big screens, absorbed by a game a thousand miles away. Many had given up the pretense entirely: They were on the concourse, gathered around any television they could find.
The match they had come to watch at the M.C.G. was a significant one. Only a couple of games remained in the regular season of the Australian Football League, and the two teams in attendance, Carlton and Melbourne, were jockeying for position in the playoffs. The stakes were high enough to draw a crowd of almost 70,000 fans.
For much of the first quarter, though, the spectators' eyes and minds were elsewhere: In Brisbane, to be exact, where Australia's World Cup quarterfinal with France had gone to a penalty kick shootout. The live sporting event playing out in front of them could not compete with the appeal of the Matildas. At this point, very little can.
Over the course of the last three weeks, Australia has fallen -- and fallen hard -- for its women's soccer team. The whole country seems to be decked out in green and gold. Images of Matildas players beam out from billboards and television screens and the front pages of every newspaper.
One paper, The Courier-Mail of Brisbane, was briefly rebranded as The Kerr-ier Mail, in honor of Sam Kerr, Australia's captain. Anthony Albanese, the prime minister, has expressed support for a national holiday if the team wins the World Cup.
"We went out on a team walk in Brisbane before the France game," defender Clare Hunt said. "And I had a moment where I thought: 'Oh my God, this is actually happening.' We were swarmed by the public, and they were chanting for us. We are a little separate from it, but when you're in packed stadiums, when you see people on the streets, see people investing in women's soccer, you realize what's happening."
The Matildas' games have consistently shattered records for television viewing figures. Their crucial group stage victory against Canada attracted an audience of 4.7 million people, making it the most-watched program of the year on the national Seven Network.
Their next game, against Denmark in the round of 16, was watched by a total of about 6.5 million people. It was the biggest television event of the year, on any network, for roughly four days: until the peak audience for Australia-France in the quarterfinals stretched beyond seven million.
That figure does not include those who streamed it online or the vast crowds that gathered in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth to watch it en masse. By most estimates, it was the nation's highest-rated sports event in a decade. The team's semifinal match with England on Wednesday was cumulatively expected to surpass the 8.8 million who watched Cathy Freeman win gold in the 400 meters at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.
The best gauge of how deep the Matildas' impact runs, though, is in the reaction from Australia's other major sports. For years, soccer, men's or women's, has struggled to compete for both attention and revenue in what is an unusually rich sporting ecosystem, fading in comparison not only to cricket, the national summer game, but to a panoply of winter sports, all of which are known, a little unhelpfully, as "footy."
"For a long time, the country was divided along the Barassi Line," said Hunter Fujak, a lecturer in sports management at Deakin University. The line, named in tribute to the famed former player, coach and commentator Ron Barassi, is an imaginary, but potent, fissure. It runs from northwest to southeast, splitting Australia's population, if not its geography, roughly in half.
To the west of the line (Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Darwin, Tasmania) lies Australian rules football country. East of it (Sydney, Brisbane, Canberra) is rugby territory. The latter comes in two forms: rugby union, comprising teams of 15 players and broadly considered middle class; and rugby league, the more popular and more blue collar version played with teams of 13.
Traditionally, relations between those various sports -- the so-called football codes -- are frosty. They have tended to hover, in fact, somewhere between resolutely competitive and downright hostile, a phenomenon known in Australia as the code wars. The battle is a prominent enough feature of the country's cultural landscape for Fujak to have used it as the title of a book on the subject.
"All of the codes have historically been resistant to each other's success," Fujak said. In part, the motivation is just business: Australia may be an immense country, but its population is relatively small.
The A.F.L. and the N.R.L. -- the national rugby league tournament -- are competing for the same limited number of eyeballs, broadcast deals, commercial revenue and governmental subsidy. The working assumption has always been that one's rise must come at the expense of the other. "There are only so many people to go around," Fujak said. "You would expect that of Coke and Pepsi, so why would the sports leagues be any different?"
The enmity is so keenly felt, though, because it runs significantly deeper than mere mercantile instinct. "There's a very strong rivalry at the cultural level," Fujak said. "At a fan level, the sport you follow is inseparable from identity. For Victorians, being an A.F.L. fan is part of who you are, where you're from."
In that power struggle, soccer has long been little more than collateral damage. If the A.F.L. and N.R.L. have cast themselves as not just authentically Australian but as a central pillar of a localized identity, soccer has been projected as an often unwelcome import.
Though it has always been popular as a participatory sport, the game -- as one notorious, offensive mantra put it -- was long cast as a lesser form, simultaneously effeminate, foreign and homosexual. Craig Foster, a former Australia player and now a human-rights activist, recently told the BBC that the A.F.L., in particular, has been "antagonistic" toward soccer.
That animosity has manifested in both the practical -- refusing soccer teams access to its facilities, declining to allow its stadiums to be used as part of Australia's doomed bid to host the 2022 men's World Cup -- and the petty.
It was noted, for example, that the A.F.L. chose to release its schedule for this season at almost the exact minute Australia's men's team kicked off against Argentina in the men's World Cup last year. The A.F.L. has always maintained it was just a quirk of timing.
In the weeks leading up to the Women's World Cup, it appeared little had changed. Though several rugby league stadiums were slated to host matches, the A.F.L. had not been willing to surrender its largest arenas, the M.C.G. and the Sydney Cricket Ground, two of Australia's best-known venues.
That posture, Fujak said, was not unreasonable: FIFA's rules would have required the A.F.L. to vacate its two major arenas for two months at the very height of the season. "The demands were too onerous," he said. Still, it did not exactly suggest that Australia's other sports were about to show the Women's World Cup, or the Matildas, much hospitality.
Over the last few weeks, that concern has been proved demonstrably false. "This is without doubt one of the most exciting times to be an Australian sports fan in the country's history," said Andrew Abdo, the N.R.L.'s chief executive. "The Matildas' performances in the World Cup have made a monumental contribution to the rise of women's sport in Australia."
In deeds, as much as in words, the A.F.L. has been no less effusive. It has moved kickoff times to accommodate Matildas games. On Saturday, it broadcast the France quarterfinal before, during and after games in Melbourne and Sydney.
Matthew Nicks, the head coach of the Adelaide Crows, admitted he would rather "be watching the Matildas" than guiding his team in a game against the Brisbane Lions. He and his counterpart, Chris Fagan, were filmed watching the penalty shootout on a phone when they were supposed to be conducting their postgame media duties.
Both codes of football, the commentator George Megalogenis wrote in The Brisbane Times, have been "dreading the moment that soccer holds the nation's attention, and now that moment is here." So compelling has the Matildas' journey been, though, that they have melted away every last vestige of resistance.
Foster, the former men's player, believes that has been rooted more in pragmatism than a fundamental, lasting shift in the way the codes regard each other. The A.F.L. agreed to show the France game in its stadiums because "it was worried nobody would turn up" for the fixtures otherwise, he said.
Fujak, too, suggested that willfully ignoring the tournament would have made the A.F.L. look "sulky and negative" at a moment of uplifting national unity. "It's the most strategically astute sports league in the country," he said. "It might be cynical, but I think they saw it as the lesser of two evils."
He wondered if the A.F.L. had made something of a calculation. "They've always played the long game," he said. "Soccer has moments of success but, come the end of the tournament, it fades away again."
The risk, this time, is that the effect will be more lasting, that this tournament has on some level reshaped Australia's entrenched sporting landscape. The code wars may rumble on, in some form, but the Matildas, at least, have risen above them. They have become, in three short weeks, a core part of the country's identity.

Clarence Avant, Mighty Engine Behind Black Superstars, Dies at 92: [Correction]

Author: Genzlinger, Neil

Publication info: Genzlinger, Neil.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Behind the scenes, he furthered the careers of numerous entertainers, as well as some athletes and politicians.
Clarence Avant, a record executive who shaped the careers not only of Bill Withers, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson and other Black singers, but also of politicians, actors and sports figures -- exerting so much influence that a 2019 documentary about him was called simply "The Black Godfather" -- died on Sunday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 92.
His family announced his death in a statement.
Mr. Avant (pronounced AY-vant), born in a segregated hospital in North Carolina and educated only through the ninth grade, moved easily in the high-powered world of entertainment, helping to establish the idea that Black culture and consumers were forces to be reckoned with.
He started out managing a nightclub in Newark in the late 1950s and moved on to representing some of the artists he met there. Joe Glaser, a high-powered agent who handled Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and many other top acts, took Mr. Avant under his wing; perhaps, the documentary suggested, Mr. Glaser, who was white, thought it would be advantageous to have a Black man representing some of his Black clients.
In any case, Mr. Avant was soon handling artists including the jazz organist Jimmy Smith and traveling in rarefied circles. Not all his clients were Black; he said Mr. Glaser sent him to Los Angeles in 1964 with the Argentine pianist Lalo Schifrin, who was then working with Dizzy Gillespie, to try to get Mr. Schifrin started on a career composing for film and television. Though he knew nothing about the movie business, Mr. Avant worked his brand of magic on the West Coast: Mr. Schifrin has to date been nominated for six Oscars.
In 1969 Mr. Avant formed Sussex Records -- he said the name was his combination of the two things people want more than anything else, success and sex -- which lasted only about half a decade but released, among other records, Mr. Withers's early albums.
"Clarence made some great choices musically," Mr. Withers, who died in 2020, said in the documentary. "'Lean on Me"' -- Mr. Withers's only Billboard No. 1 hit -- "was not my choice for a single."
Later in the 1970s Mr. Avant founded Tabu Records, and for a time in the 1990s he was chairman of Motown. He also helped Jim Brown, the football player, build an acting career and negotiated an endorsement deal for Hank Aaron, the Hall of Fame baseball player, as well as supporting the political careers of Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
"One of the things he understands is, there are different kinds of power," Mr. Obama said in the documentary. "There's the power that needs the spotlight, but there's also the power that comes from being behind the scenes."
In 2013, accepting the entrepreneur award at the BET Honors, one of many he received in his career, Mr. Avant summed himself up.
"I can't make speeches," he told the crowd while clutching his trophy. "That's not my life. I make deals."
Clarence Alexander Avant was born on Feb. 25, 1931, in Greensboro, N.C., to Gertrude Avant Woods, a domestic worker. In the documentary, he said his mother was not married to his father, Phoenix Jarrell, whom he barely knew.
He grew up in Climax, N.C., in difficult circumstances and stayed in school only through ninth grade.
"We were poor," he said in the film. "I'm talking about poor, poor, poor. We had chicken-feet soup."
Racism was omnipresent, and the Ku Klux Klan loomed large.
"My mother would just tell us, if you hear a car coming, run and hide; lay down flat," he said.
He grew up with a stepfather, Eddie Woods, who was abusive, and he said he left home when he was a teenager after his attempt to kill the man by putting rat poison in his food failed. He went to live with an aunt in Summit, N.J.
For a time he held a low-level job at Martindale-Hubbell, publisher of a law directory. In his 20s he started working at a Newark nightclub that featured Black musicians. That was his introduction to the entertainment business, and he proved a natural.
"I think Clarence exemplifies a certain cool," Mr. Obama said in the documentary, "a certain level of street smarts and savvy that allowed him to move into worlds that nobody had prepared him for and say, 'I can figure this out."'
As his career representing entertainers began to flourish, Mr. Avant met Jacqueline Gray, a model. They married in 1967, and as the couple prospered Ms. Avant became noted for her philanthropic work.
In December 2021 a man burglarizing the Avants' home, Aariel Maynor, shot and killed her. He pleaded guilty to multiple charges the next year and was sentenced to life in prison.
In the documentary, friends remarked on their long marriage, somewhat unusual in the entertainment world.
"They still look like they've got wedding cake on their feet," the actor Jamie Foxx said, "like they just walked off a soul wedding cake."
Mr. Avant's daughter, Nicole Avant, said in a phone interview that after the tragedy, her father made a conscious effort to press on.
"Music was, I think, the lifesaving force for him," she said, especially that of Ellington, Frank Sinatra and other artists from his youth. "His mood changed when the music came on."
At about the time he was getting ready to marry Jacqueline, Mr. Avant was growing more vocal about racial matters. A 1967 article in The Pittsburgh Courier quoted a strongly worded letter he had written to the management of WLIB, a radio station in New York that was aimed at a Black audience but at the time was white-owned.
"Is your station managed by Negroes," he wrote, "and I am not referring to Negro disc jockeys?"
"I think radio stations whose programs are supposed to appeal to the so-called Negro market," he added, "should at least be staffed by Negro personnel."
He was also becoming active politically. He supported the early campaigns of Andrew Young, who made an unsuccessful run for a Georgia congressional seat in 1970 and a successful one two years later. It was Mr. Young who connected Mr. Avant to Hank Aaron when he was about to break Babe Ruth's career home run record in 1974.
"Clarence called me up and said, 'Andy, do you know Hank Aaron?"' Mr. Young recalled in the documentary, which was directed by Reginald Hudlin. "I said, 'Yeah, he lives around the corner.' He said, 'If he's about to break Babe Ruth's record, he's supposed to make some money."'
Mr. Avant wanted to help Mr. Aaron secure some endorsement deals.
"Will you tell him that I'm not crazy and I'm going to call him?" Mr. Avant asked Mr. Young.
"I said, 'Well, I can't vouch for you not being crazy,"' Mr. Young said, "'but I'll tell him that you've been very helpful to me."'
It was fraught territory -- Mr. Aaron was receiving death threats over the prospect that he would break a hallowed record set by a white player. Mr. Avant, though, according to the documentary, marched into the office of the president of Coca-Cola and told him, in unprintably blunt language, that Black people drink Coke.
Mr. Avant's guidance helped Mr. Aaron secure a substantial deal from Coke and otherwise market himself, which fueled his later charitable endeavors.
"Henry Aaron would not be Henry Aaron if it were not for Clarence Avant," Mr. Aaron, who died in 2021, said in the film.

Mr. Avant also helped other athletes, including Jim Brown as he transitioned from football into acting in the 1960s. Interviewed for the documentary, Mr. Brown, one of the biggest Black stars of the 1960s and '70s, had a hard time pinning down what Mr. Avant did -- not an uncommon thing among those who knew and worked with Mr. Avant.
"You have this guy called Clarence Avant that everybody's talking about, but nobody seems to understand just what his official title was," Mr. Brown, who died in May, said, recalling their early meetings. "I couldn't tell you now exactly what he -- was he an agent, a manager, a lawyer? -- what he was."
Mr. Avant had rocky times in the mid-1970s, when the Sussex label went bankrupt and KAGB-FM, a radio station he had bought (making it one of the first Black-owned stations in the Los Angeles area), floundered. But, he said, friends were always his most important asset, and some of them helped him get back on his feet.
Tabu Records, which Mr. Avant founded in 1975, released records by the S.O.S. Band, Cherrelle and others.
In addition to his daughter, who was a producer of "The Black Godfather," Mr. Avant is survived by a son, Alexander, and a sister, Anne Woods.
The Avant home was always abuzz with A-list visitors. Nicole Avant recalled a day, when she was 12, that she and a friend got into trouble at school. The friend's mother, driving Nicole home, was fuming -- until she saw Harry Belafonte walking out of the Avants' house.
"Is that Harry Belafonte?" the woman asked her.
"I said, 'Yeah, how do you know Harry Belafonte?" -- not realizing he was anyone other than a friend who would come around to visit her parents from time to time.
Ms. Avant, who served as ambassador to the Bahamas during the Obama administration, said that Mr. Belafonte and others who would gather at the Avant home were serious about breaking down racial barriers, in the entertainment world and in society in general.
"They knew that they were on a mission," she said.
The flood of tributes offered to Mr. Avant on Monday included many from younger performers who appreciated his legacy.
"He is the ultimate example of what change looks like, what architecting change looks like, and what the success of change looks like," the rapper and producer Pharrell said in a statement. "He stared adversity in the face in climates and conditions that weren't welcoming to people that looked like him. But through his talent and relentless spirit in the pursuit to be the best of the best, he garnered the support and friendship of people who otherwise wouldn't look in our direction."

Summer is high season for the hot dog, from backyard grills to ballparks to the finest roadside joints. Across the United States, hot dogs exhibit a striking diversity that reflects the microclimates in which they’ve evolved ever since the 1860s, when an entrepreneurial immigrant introduced the species from Germany. Here we take a wide-ranging, but admittedly inexhaustive, look at some of the varieties you may encounter in the wild.
NEW YORK DOG
Natural habitat: The Big Apple
Distinctive features: All beef, with sauerkraut and spicy brown mustard
New York state is an epicenter of American hotdoggery, home to beloved hyperlocal wieners like Syracuse’s Snappy Grillers, micro-regional variants like the three-inchers of Troy, and destination footlongs like those grilled over coals at Ted’s in Buffalo. Still, New York City lays claim to the defining dogs: not the dirty-water type, but the kosher franks puckering on the griddles at Nathan’s Famous in Coney Island, pastrami-slinging delis and storefronts with “Papaya” in their names. Tomato-stained “onions in sauce” is a worthy condiment, but spicy brown mustard with either sauerkraut (for traditionalists) or relish (for swashbucklers) is the move. Tales are even told of those who take both.
TEXAS TOMMY
Natural habitat: The Delaware Valley, oddly
Distinctive features: Bacon and cheese
In the grand tradition of misleading hot dog names, this mid-20th-century creation hails not from the Lone Star State but, reportedly, from Pottstown, Pennsylvania. It may have taken its name from a Ragtime dance that was as indecorous then as the topping combo may seem today. Now you can get one from Wilmington, Delaware (at Johnnie’s Dog House & Chicken Shack, it’s bacon-wrapped in the original fashion), to Philadelphia (at Steve’s Prince of Steaks, you’ll find a split wiener topped with bacon strips and whiz). The region’s other contender, a fried fish cake on a dog, doesn’t stand a chance.
SLAW DOG
Natural habitat: The South
Distinctive features: The slaw
In West Virginia, which lays claim to masterminding the topping way back in the 1920s, it’s often paired with hot dog sauce (or, as some might identify it, chili). In North Carolina, it could come piled on an electric-red, locally revered Bright Leaf dog. The dog is nearly vermilion at Nu-Way Weiners, a Macon, Georgia., destination since 1916, where the slaw atop the chili is cold, creamy and finely chopped. So, too, is the topping at the Varsity in Atlanta, where it’s a valid move to skip the chili and order an all-beef frank crowned with just slaw.
PUERTO RICAN-STYLE DOG
Natural habitat: The island’s many stands and carts
Distinctive features: No topping spared
Puerto Rico is rich with carts selling hot dogs adorned in the Boricua style. These low-key setups belie the joys of this frank, which is decked out with some version of virtually every standard topping: Squirts of mustard, ketchup and cheese sauce join forces with layers of sauerkraut, onions and carne molida (ground beef cooked with sofrito that plays the role of chili). Finally, there are crunchy potato sticks, the crown that turns this variety into dog royalty.
THE SONORAN
Natural habitat: Arizona in general, Tucson in particular
Distinctive features: The best kind of fusion
The name nods to the leading theory of its provenance: Sonora, the Mexican state just across the border. But spend enough time in metro Phoenix or Tucson and you’ll see that this extravagant dog is Arizonan to the core. The “dogueros” who operate the mobile outfits (like El Sabroso in Phoenix) and griddles (Los Chipilones in Tucson) don’t hold back. In a roll that clocks in somewhere between bolillo and bun, there are pinto beans, diced tomatoes and onions, as well as stripes of mustard, drizzles of green salsa and squiggles of mayo. Under there somewhere is a hot dog wrapped in bacon and on the side, a little gift — a couple of charred yellow chiles.
THE RIPPER
Natural habitat: North Jersey
Distinctive features: Deep-fried perfection
The paradigmatic New Jersey dog is defined by its cooking method, a bath in hot oil that transforms a natural-casing frank into the blistered archetype of ugly-delicious. Some North Jersey legends specialize in the ultimate version: rippers. The default at Hiram’s Roadstand in Fort Lee and an option at Rutt’s Hut in Clifton, they are fried until they burst and new nooks and crags emerge to char as crisp as cracklings. Chili-cheese, relish and mustard are all welcome. A highly honorable mention goes to the Italian Dog, invented in Newark at the original Jimmy Buff’s: Two links are fried, stuffed in “pizza bread” and buried under cooked peppers, onions and crispy potato.
NEW YORK SYSTEM
Natural habitat: Rhode Island, strangely
Distinctive features: Meat sauce, strict parameters and a touch of flair
Don’t let the “New York” fool you — these are pure Rhode Island, and rival Chicago dogs in their particularity. The midcentury brainchild of the Original New York System restaurant, they are also called hot wieners, gaggers and Greek lobsters, though never hot dogs. At places that carry on the tradition, staffers deftly prepare them “on the arm,” lining up steamed, slightly sweet buns from Homestead Baking Co. on their forearms and filling them with wieners made from veal, beef and pork. They are then dressed with mustard, “meat sauce” (what an outsider might call chili), raw onions and a flurry of celery salt. That’s “all the way,” and with a glass of coffee milk on the side, it’s the only way.
CHICAGO DOG
Natural habitat: The Windy City and its environs
Distinctive features: “The garden”
Regional hot dog tradition at its most precise, the Chicago dog is an improbable masterpiece, whether you’re peacefully taking down a boiled version at Superdawg Drive-In or ordering a char dog while you get roasted by the staff at the Wiener’s Circle. It’s “dragged through the garden,” which means topped with exactly seven items that doting partisans can rattle off without hesitation: yellow mustard, relish (customarily a neon green), chopped white onions, tomato slices, a pickle spear, pickled sport peppers and celery salt. The foundation beneath is also imperative: a natural casing, all beef (nearly always from the local wiener maestros at Vienna Beef), tucked inside a poppy-seed bun.
HALF SMOKE
Natural habitat: Washington, D.C.
Distinctive features: A special sausage
Underneath the blanket of saucy chili and beyond the chopped onions and yellow mustard that are vital to a Half Smoke served “all the way” is the signature sausage that defines this capital classic. While the smoky, slightly spicy pork-and-beef links were invented as breakfast fare at the Weenie Beenie, they are now available at establishments throughout the city. But no purveyor is more famous than Ben’s Chili Bowl, the U Street monument to meat. Technically, its Half Smoke is more sausage than hot dog, but it’s so good that we don’t care.
CHEESE CONEY
Natural habitat: The chili parlors of Cincinnati
Distinctive features: The city’s famous (or infamous) chili
This Midwestern standout wields a familiar trinity: chopped onion, a stripe of mustard, a sauce of finely ground beef. But it is then topped with a prodigal pile of shredded Cheddar. Adherents who haunt parlors like Skyline and Camp Washington scoff at the it’s-not-chili complaints, celebrating the sauce’s distinctive spicing of nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon — and the miraculous merging of Mediterranean and Slavic flavors with early-20th-century American tastes. That said, they also take theirs on spaghetti, so the jury’s still out.
SEATTLE DOG
Natural habitat: The food carts of Seattle
Distinctive features: Hot frank, cool cream cheese
Outsiders sometimes wince at the thought of Seattle Dogs. Even some locals consider them fit only for a post-boozing binge. Yet there they are, cream cheese-slathered buns hosting hot dogs. Lore has it that the creation is a good three decades old, invented by a bagel purveyor named Hadley Longe. He opened a bagel cart in Pioneer Square, and soon after began offering dogs served with a schmear on bialy rolls, begetting imitators galore who swapped in buns. Griddled onions — possibly a nod to the onions on bialys — complete the style.
CONEYS
Natural habitat: Michigan
Distinctive features: Not just another chili dog with mustard and raw white onion
Coney Island is the name for the dogs, the whole category of restaurants that sell them, and the place that inspired their originator, a Greek immigrant (either Gust Keros or George Todoroff, depending on whom you ask) who passed through the hot dog hub of New York City on his way west. Michiganders differ, with Midwestern politeness, over Coney particulars: In Detroit, the Coney sauce at the stalwarts American Coney Island and Lafayette Coney Island has a fluidity that makes staining your shirt inevitable. In Flint, locals call the sauce “dry” as a compliment, while the city of Jackson has its own variation, with differences so subtle they’re nearly undetectable by outsiders. Most everyone seems to agree on the supremacy of Koegel’s brand dogs and the necessity of beef heart in the chili.
BOLOGNA DOG
Natural habitat: The Jewish delis of Baltimore
Distinctive features: Beef two ways
The heyday of Baltimore’s Jewish delis has passed, but the legacy lives on, at least at Attman’s Deli, one of the last vestiges of East Lombard Street’s Corned Beef Row, and the Essen Room in nearby Pikesville. Both still offer the duet of emulsified meats that’s become known as Baltimore’s hot dog. Slices of griddled beef bologna on an all-beef frank is a textural lark and, as beloved local historian Gilbert Sandler noted, “grease from the bologna mixes with the grease from the hot dog, and both find their way into the bread.” What sounds like redundancy is actually profundity.
POLISH BOY
Natural habitat: Cleveland
Distinctive features: Kielbasa a la barbecue
Long ago, Clevelanders said “Polish boy” and meant kielbasa, the garlicky smoked sausage beloved by the Polish immigrants who arrived in the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today the term refers to this sloppy sensation, a glorious fusion. Propelled by local Black-owned smoked-meat concerns like Virgil Whitmore Sr.’s Mt. Pleasant Bar-B-Q, cooks began to furnish the city’s hallowed sausage with the toppings on hand: coleslaw, a pile of fries and plenty of barbecue sauce.
REINDEER DOG
Natural habitat: Alaska
Distinctive features: A delicately gamy link, Coca-Cola onions
In the summer of 1892, Capt. Michael Healy brought back the first reindeer from Siberia as a new food source for hungry Alaskans. That same summer, Nathan Handwerker (the founder of Nathan’s Famous) was born. Coincidence? Well, yes. All the same, today Alaska’s on-a-bun benefaction is a dog made with lean, delicately gamy reindeer. The consummate rendition comes from Yeti Dogs in Anchorage, where the link teams up with another Alaskan hot dog tradition: sautéed onions spiked with Coca-Cola.

Clarence Avant, Mighty Engine Behind Black Superstars, Dies at 92: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Behind the scenes, he furthered the careers of numerous entertainers, as well as some athletes and politicians.
Clarence Avant, a record executive who shaped the careers not only of Bill Withers, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson and other Black singers, but also of politicians, actors and sports figures -- exerting so much influence that a 2019 documentary about him was called simply "The Black Godfather" -- died on Sunday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 92.
His family announced his death in a statement.
Mr. Avant (pronounced AY-vant), born in a segregated hospital in North Carolina and educated only through the ninth grade, moved easily in the high-powered world of entertainment, helping to establish the idea that Black culture and consumers were forces to be reckoned with.
He started out managing a nightclub in Newark in the late 1950s and moved on to representing some of the artists he met there. Joe Glaser, a high-powered agent who handled Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and many other top acts, took Mr. Avant under his wing; perhaps, the documentary suggested, Mr. Glaser, who was white, thought it would be advantageous to have a Black man representing some of his Black clients.
In any case, Mr. Avant was soon handling artists including the jazz organist Jimmy Smith and traveling in rarefied circles. Not all his clients were Black; he said Mr. Glaser sent him to Los Angeles in 1964 with the Argentine pianist Lalo Schifrin, who was then working with Dizzy Gillespie, to try to get Mr. Schifrin started on a career composing for film and television. Though he knew nothing about the movie business, Mr. Avant worked his brand of magic on the West Coast: Mr. Schifrin has to date been nominated for six Oscars.
In 1969 Mr. Avant formed Sussex Records -- he said the name was his combination of the two things people want more than anything else, success and sex -- which lasted only about half a decade but released, among other records, Mr. Withers's early albums.
"Clarence made some great choices musically," Mr. Withers, who died in 2020, said in the documentary. "'Lean on Me"' -- Mr. Withers's only Billboard No. 1 hit -- "was not my choice for a single."
Later in the 1970s Mr. Avant founded Tabu Records, and for a time in the 1990s he was chairman of Motown. He also helped Jim Brown, the football player, build an acting career and negotiated an endorsement deal for Hank Aaron, the Hall of Fame baseball player, as well as supporting the political careers of Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
"One of the things he understands is, there are different kinds of power," Mr. Obama said in the documentary. "There's the power that needs the spotlight, but there's also the power that comes from being behind the scenes."
In 2013, accepting the entrepreneur award at the BET Honors, one of many he received in his career, Mr. Avant summed himself up.
"I can't make speeches," he told the crowd while clutching his trophy. "That's not my life. I make deals."
Clarence Alexander Avant was born on Feb. 25, 1931, in Greensboro, N.C., to Gertrude Avant Woods, a domestic worker. In the documentary, he said his mother was not married to his father, Phoenix Jarrell, whom he barely knew.
He grew up in Climax, N.C., in difficult circumstances and stayed in school only through ninth grade.
"We were poor," he said in the film. "I'm talking about poor, poor, poor. We had chicken-feet soup."
Racism was omnipresent, and the Ku Klux Klan loomed large.
"My mother would just tell us, if you hear a car coming, run and hide; lay down flat," he said.
He grew up with a stepfather, Eddie Woods, who was abusive, and he said he left home when he was a teenager after his attempt to kill the man by putting rat poison in his food failed. He went to live with an aunt in Summit, N.J.
For a time he held a low-level job at Martindale-Hubbell, publisher of a law directory. In his 20s he started working at a Newark nightclub that featured Black musicians. That was his introduction to the entertainment business, and he proved a natural.
"I think Clarence exemplifies a certain cool," Mr. Obama said in the documentary, "a certain level of street smarts and savvy that allowed him to move into worlds that nobody had prepared him for and say, 'I can figure this out."'
As his career representing entertainers began to flourish, Mr. Avant met Jacqueline Gray, a model. They married in 1967, and as the couple prospered Ms. Avant became noted for her philanthropic work.
In December 2021 a man burglarizing the Avants' home, Aariel Maynor, shot and killed her. He pleaded guilty to multiple charges the next year and was sentenced to life in prison.
In the documentary, friends remarked on their long marriage, somewhat unusual in the entertainment world.
"They still look like they've got wedding cake on their feet," the actor Jamie Foxx said, "like they just walked off a soul wedding cake."
Mr. Avant's daughter, Nicole Avant, said in a phone interview that after the tragedy, her father made a conscious effort to press on.
"Music was, I think, the lifesaving force for him," she said, especially that of Ellington, Frank Sinatra and other artists from his youth. "His mood changed when the music came on."
At about the time he was getting ready to marry Jacqueline, Mr. Avant was growing more vocal about racial matters. A 1967 article in The Pittsburgh Courier quoted a strongly worded letter he had written to the management of WLIB, a radio station in New York that was aimed at a Black audience but at the time was white-owned.
"Is your station managed by Negroes," he wrote, "and I am not referring to Negro disc jockeys?"
"I think radio stations whose programs are supposed to appeal to the so-called Negro market," he added, "should at least be staffed by Negro personnel."
He was also becoming active politically. He supported the early campaigns of Andrew Young, who made an unsuccessful run for a Georgia congressional seat in 1970 and a successful one two years later. It was Mr. Young who connected Mr. Avant to Hank Aaron when he was about to break Babe Ruth's career home run record in 1974.
"Clarence called me up and said, 'Andy, do you know Hank Aaron?"' Mr. Young recalled in the documentary, which was directed by Reginald Hudlin. "I said, 'Yeah, he lives around the corner.' He said, 'If he's about to break Babe Ruth's record, he's supposed to make some money."'
Mr. Avant wanted to help Mr. Aaron secure some endorsement deals.
"Will you tell him that I'm not crazy and I'm going to call him?" Mr. Avant asked Mr. Young.
"I said, 'Well, I can't vouch for you not being crazy,"' Mr. Young said, "'but I'll tell him that you've been very helpful to me."'
It was fraught territory -- Mr. Aaron was receiving death threats over the prospect that he would break a hallowed record set by a white player. Mr. Avant, though, according to the documentary, marched into the office of the president of Coca-Cola and told him, in unprintably blunt language, that Black people drink Coke.
Mr. Avant's guidance helped Mr. Aaron secure a substantial deal from Coke and otherwise market himself, which fueled his later charitable endeavors.
"Henry Aaron would not be Henry Aaron if it were not for Clarence Avant," Mr. Aaron, who died in 2021, said in the film.

Mr. Avant also helped other athletes, including Jim Brown as he transitioned from football into acting in the 1960s. Interviewed for the documentary, Mr. Brown, one of the biggest Black stars of the 1960s and '70s, had a hard time pinning down what Mr. Avant did -- not an uncommon thing among those who knew and worked with Mr. Avant.
"You have this guy called Clarence Avant that everybody's talking about, but nobody seems to understand just what his official title was," Mr. Brown, who died in May, said, recalling their early meetings. "I couldn't tell you now exactly what he -- was he an agent, a manager, a lawyer? -- what he was."
Mr. Avant had rocky times in the mid-1970s, when the Sussex label went bankrupt and KAGB-FM, a radio station he had bought (making it one of the first Black-owned stations in the Los Angeles area), floundered. But, he said, friends were always his most important asset, and some of them helped him get back on his feet.
Tabu Records, which Mr. Avant founded in 1975, released records by the S.O.S. Band, Cherrelle and others.
In addition to his daughter, who was a producer of "The Black Godfather," Mr. Avant is survived by a son, Alexander, and a sister, Anne Woods.
The Avant home was always abuzz with A-list visitors. Nicole Avant recalled a day, when she was 12, that she and a friend got into trouble at school. The friend's mother, driving Nicole home, was fuming -- until she saw Harry Belafonte walking out of the Avants' house.
"Is that Harry Belafonte?" the woman asked her.
"I said, 'Yeah, how do you know Harry Belafonte?" -- not realizing he was anyone other than a friend who would come around to visit her parents from time to time.
Ms. Avant, who served as ambassador to the Bahamas during the Obama administration, said that Mr. Belafonte and others who would gather at the Avant home were serious about breaking down racial barriers, in the entertainment world and in society in general.
"They knew that they were on a mission," she said.
The flood of tributes offered to Mr. Avant on Monday included many from younger performers who appreciated his legacy.
"He is the ultimate example of what change looks like, what architecting change looks like, and what the success of change looks like," the rapper and producer Pharrell said in a statement. "He stared adversity in the face in climates and conditions that weren't welcoming to people that looked like him. But through his talent and relentless spirit in the pursuit to be the best of the best, he garnered the support and friendship of people who otherwise wouldn't look in our direction."

The Whole Music World's in His Hands: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nothing is simple when it comes to Jon Batiste, the pianist, television personality, New Orleans musical scion and jazz-R&B-classical savant.
He spent seven years as the smiling, melodica-toting TV bandleader on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," yet found some of his widest acclaim for solemn protest performances in Brooklyn after the murder of George Floyd.
He beat Olivia Rodrigo, Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish for album of the year at the Grammys in 2022, despite his "We Are" having just a fraction of their sales -- and then presented "American Symphony," a Whitmanesque canvas of funk, Dixieland jazz, operatic vocals and Native American drums at Carnegie Hall.
Now comes Batiste's most commercial project yet: "World Music Radio," an album with guest appearances by Lana Del Rey, Lil Wayne and the K-pop girl group NewJeans, made with a team of producers behind hits for artists like Justin Bieber and Drake, with tightly woven hooks that were engineered to fit on any Top 40-style streaming playlist.
But of course "World Music Radio," which comes out Aug. 18, is no standard pop release. It's also a fantastical concept album that challenges music's provincial genre borders, with a message of open-armed inclusivity for a fractured political era. The album's central character, a timeless interstellar being named Billy Bob Bo Bob, curates a potpourri of the far-flung musical languages of Earth and transmits it to the cosmos with chuckling, Daddy-O commentary, like Doctor Who crossed with Wolfman Jack.
"He's a D.J., he's a griot, he's a storyteller, he's a unifier, he's a rebel," Batiste told me, describing the character of Billy Bob Bo Bob. "He's a disrupter."
That's also as good an encapsulation as any of the 36-year-old Batiste himself, who can't easily be pinned down to any single role, or genre, or corner of the music market.
In his own eccentric way, "World Music Radio" is Batiste's interpretation of what mainstream pop is or should be, in which high-energy electronic dance beats coexist with reggae, Afropop and old-fashioned piano torch ballads. "Be Who You Are," the first single, has lyrics in English, Spanish and Korean, and its high-tech, partially animated music video, produced through a brand deal with Coke, features Batiste, the Latin pop star Camilo, the rapper JID and the members of NewJeans all vibing alongside each other.
Yet in discussing the album, Batiste was almost totally cerebral, speaking in long, eloquent, practically unsummarizable paragraphs about his mental and creative processes. The album's origin, he said, was partly philosophical, as he mused on the connections and divergences between "the horrendous idea of what we call 'world music"' -- local traditions viewed through a condescending Western lens -- "and the narrow diameter of what's considered popular music."
"So then, world music," Batiste added, shifting professorially on the living room sofa of his airy and immaculate Brooklyn brownstone. "What if we could reimagine that term? What if we could reinvent? What if we could use it as a prompt to expand the diameter of popular music?"
In conversation, he mentioned influences that included some of the most popular cultural productions of modern times, like Pink Floyd's "The Dark Side of the Moon" and the "Godfather" films. Jamie Krents, the president of his label, Verve, said that Batiste had cited Michael Jackson's "Thriller" as another reference point.
"He wanted to make music that was approachable to the largest possible audience without compromising," Krents said.
Still, it is hard to imagine Jackson summarizing his goals for "Billie Jean" or "Beat It" in quite the same way that Batiste does for "World Music Radio": "By listening to it and experiencing it," he explained, "you have a realization about self, about community, about humanism, that leaves you in a state of bliss and a hyper-consciousness."
AS BATISTE SEES IT, "World Music Radio" is the culmination of a career that has long snaked through supposedly disparate traditions and audiences.
Batiste grew up in Kenner, La., part of a family with deep musical roots in New Orleans, and he spent his teenage years playing late-night gigs in the French Quarter with his friend Trombone Shorty, then rushing to high school classes in the morning. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Juilliard and became a fixture around New York with his band Stay Human, especially for what he called "love riots": spontaneous, Pied Piper-like performances of "You Are My Sunshine" or Lady Gaga songs that took place on the street or in the subway, interrupting the daily grind with flashes of joy.
At the same time, with his 2013 album "Social Music," he began to develop a brand of activism that emphasized music's power to find common ground amid ever-widening political polarization.
"Inclusive is not even the right word," Batiste said of his approach. "It's more, OK, we're coexisting as human beings on Earth. We're not a monolith. But underneath it all, we're the same. That's not something that can be interpreted in the binary climate that we're in now."
In 2015, Batiste and Stay Human became the house band on Colbert's new CBS show, where Batiste performed comedic musical skits but had little outlet to express his broader political or social views. And, with over 200 shows a year, he also couldn't tour -- something that, incredibly, Batiste has never done as a headlining act.
"We Are," which was begun in late 2019 and completed the following year at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, became Batiste's vehicle for protest and for communicating the wider social ambitions of his music. Although the album had barely registered in the marketplace, Batiste became the surprise top nominee for the 64th annual Grammy Awards, getting eight nods for "We Are" and three more for the movie soundtrack "Soul." (The score for "Soul" also won Batiste, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross an Oscar.)
At the same time, Batiste's longtime partner, Suleika Jaouad, had spent years struggling with cancer and writing about it in The New York Times. The day the Grammy nominations were announced, Jaouad began a round of chemotherapy. "At certain points of her treatment," Batiste said, "her immune system was so compromised that we couldn't be in the same room."
They married last year, and after a bone-marrow transplant, Jaouad's health has improved enough that they recently took a vacation in Europe. "A major, major milestone," Batiste said.
When "We Are" took album of the year, Batiste became the latest piñata for critics of the entire Grammy system, who pointed to his victory as a sign of an insider-controlled process out of touch with music's dominant trends. Yet it also represented a necessary tension between artistic excellence, as judged by fellow musicians, and the pressure to reward commercial success. For another example, just look at the last Black man before Batiste to take the top prize: Herbie Hancock, back in 2008.
After his Grammy and Oscar wins, Batiste decided to leave Colbert's show. Freed of that work, he now describes "World Music Radio" as his return to the concepts he explored a decade ago on "Social Music" -- and imagined himself as Odysseus from Homer's "Odyssey."
"It's the hero's journey we always talk about," Batiste said. "It feels kind of like, wow, I came back to where I was 10 years before, but now everything's different, even though I'm in the same place that I was. I'm home, so to speak. But everything's different."
Colbert, in an interview, said that when Batiste approached him about leaving, "he didn't have to tell me why."
"But I did say I can understand why you would want to take this opportunity at this moment and go full-bore," Colbert added. "I know that feeling very well: Give me the ball and see how fast I can run."
THE MUSIC ON "World Music Radio" had its genesis, Batiste said, when he crossed paths with the producer Rick Rubin in Italy a few months after the Grammys. Rubin offered him use of Shangri-La, his beachside studio in Malibu, Calif., and Batiste headed there in August 2022 for a month of immersive work with a crew of producers and artists who came and went, generating what Batiste said were the kernels of upward of 125 songs.
Among Batiste's collaborators there was Del Rey, who worked with Batiste on "Candy Necklace," from her latest album, "Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd," and she joins him on "Life Lesson," a melancholy duet on "World Music Radio."
The producer Rogét Chahayed, who has worked with Doja Cat, Drake and others, said he headed to Shangri-La after getting a surprise invitation from Batiste via Instagram. The sessions, he said, were spontaneous and fruitful, with Batiste sometimes kicking off hours of improvisatory jams after simply being inspired by a synthesizer tone.
"It was just like magic in the room," Chahayed recalled. "It was right around evening time, the sun was setting over the ocean. I was like, this doesn't happen often, in the kind of sessions that we usually have in these freezing cold studios with no windows."
After those sessions, Jon Bellion, a pop performer and producer who has worked with Maroon 5 and the Jonas Brothers, collaborated with Batiste on a process he dubs "Batistifying" the material -- combing through piles of half-finished material and whittling it down to a finished, coherent product.
With a deadline from his label looming, Batiste said, he felt that the album was not coming together until he sat in his basement studio in Brooklyn and listened to a vocal track sent by a Spanish singer, Rita Payés. She contributes to "My Heart," a sepia-toned Latin ballad in waltz time on which Batiste channels Ibrahim Ferrer of the Buena Vista Social Club. Hearing Payés's voice transmitted over a speaker, Batiste said, instantly suggested the album's concept.
"It sounds like it's coming out of a radio that's sitting on top of the bar at a cafe in Catalonia, Spain," Batiste said. "The working title up until that point was 'World Music.' And it was like, ohhh, 'World Music Radio."' He worked through the night to put together a rough version of the album, dreaming up Billy Bob Bo Bob as a narrator who segues between tracks and sometimes chirps in with an approving voice-over.
Another collaborator that Batiste pursued was the smooth-jazz saxman Kenny G. Batiste described him with a certain detached curiosity as a fellow artist who has one foot in jazz and another in pop, who has carved out a hugely successful niche but faced unending waves of critical vitriol.
"Anybody who's talked about with that kind of extreme disdain," Batiste said, "I always want to study."
On the track "Clair de Lune," which opens with an obscure sample from an old French folk album, Kenny G contributes a minute-long solo that is busier and more harmonically dense than his usual hooks, but with a singing tone that is instantly recognizable.
In an interview, Kenny G said that Batiste had asked him about the polarized reactions to his work.
"You've got to play what sounds good to you, and feels good to you," Kenny G recalled telling him. "Lucky for you, there's a big audience that seems to like what you do. Then you really don't have to apologize for that."
WHEN ASKED ABOUT his commercial hopes for "World Music Radio," Batiste was typically circuitous and nuanced, saying that on one hand, he wants to compete with stars like Taylor Swift for top chart positions, but he also recognizes that his take on popular culture is more conceptual and abstract. He was most straightforward in saying he couldn't wait to head out on tour.
He seems most prepared for any reaction to his social commentary on the album. "Love Black folks and white folks," Batiste sings on "Be Who You Are." "My Asians, my Africans, my Afro-Eurasian, Republican or Democrat."
Even that simple message of openness and acceptance is relatively rare in an era when many pop stars shrink away from any social commentary at all, out of fear of alienating part of their audience and sacrificing clicks. It's a risk Batiste is determined to take.
"To say I love everybody, including Republicans -- as a Black guy, I don't know how that could go," he said. "That shouldn't be something that's frowned upon or looked at in a way that probably to some seems like, 'Oh, he's not really clear on what's important."'
"It's radical today to love everybody," he added. "We are in a time that there's more of a pressure to make people into the other, and to dehumanize them in the process. But the act of removing a certain baseline of humanity in how we approach living amongst each other, that should be radical. That should be the thing that is disruptive."

A Day at the Fair Is Trump's Show: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Donald J. Trump asserted his dominance in Iowa on Saturday as he squared off against his closest rival, Ron DeSantis, in the Super Bowl of retail politics.
The crowd cheered. The pork was charred. And then someone shouted at former President Donald J. Trump, asking him to identify his biggest challenger in the 2024 Republican primary.
"Don't see him," Mr. Trump replied.
Mr. Trump signaled that he was looking past his leading rival, Ron DeSantis, on Saturday, as the two candidates converged at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. But his campaign team took every opportunity to needle the Florida governor.
Though the two candidates never crossed paths, Mr. Trump's appearance was scheduled to coincide with Mr. DeSantis's visit. Mr. Trump engineered a boisterous arrival, which included his private plane buzzing overhead, as Mr. DeSantis finished flipping pork chops. And Mr. Trump brought with him a bevy of Florida House members who had endorsed him over their own governor.
It was a rare moment of side-by-side comparison for Mr. Trump and his main opponent, and the mob of supporters following Mr. Trump's every move underscored his superior standing. Mr. Trump leads Mr. DeSantis by an average of more than 30 percentage points nationally, though his margin is slightly smaller in Iowa -- a gap that his rivals hope will narrow, as the criminal cases against him proceed. The first contest in 2024 is widely seen as the best opportunity to slow Mr. Trump's march to the nomination.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly tried to assert his dominance as the front-runner, citing his polling advantage in social media posts and nearly every speech. But the overlapping appearances on Saturday marked just the latest instance of Mr. Trump's trying to overshadow Mr. DeSantis in Iowa, a sign of how his team views Mr. DeSantis: as his lone serious rival.
The two men cut strikingly different paths at the fairgrounds, as they wound their way through the pens of pigs, past the 600-pound sculpture of a cow carved in butter, and stands selling local delicacies, like deep-fried balls of bacon and cheese.
Mr. DeSantis, joined by his wife, Casey, and their three children, wore jeans and what has become his standard Iowa-casual fare of a custom-made, short sleeve button-down fishing shirt with his name and title emblazoned on his chest. He rode the Ferris wheel, played fair games and crashed bumper cars.
Mr. Trump took to the fairgrounds in a navy suit, with cuff links, and was greeted by a throng of cheering supporters at every stop. He signed hats, waved to the crowds and petted a goat before being driven to the Steer N' Stein building, where he gave brief remarks.
It is not clear when the two men will be in the same place at the same time. Touting his sizable polling lead, Mr. Trump has said it would be "stupid" for him to attend this month's first debate of the primary, in which Mr. DeSantis and the rest of his rivals have struggled to gain traction.
But on Saturday, there was plenty of old-school politicking and political theater. At one point, a plane circled the fairgrounds with a "Be likable, Ron!" banner trailing behind. The banner had two inside jabs: The first was a reference to leaked 2018 debate preparations in which Mr. DeSantis was instructed to write the word "likable" in front of him. The second was the exclamation point, which was designed to look like the logo of a previous Florida governor Mr. Trump dispatched in 2016: Jeb Bush.
And before Mr. Trump took the stage, his team handed out leaflets attacking Mr. DeSantis for his position on agricultural issues, calling him an "utter catastrophe" for farmers.
The handouts were a reminder of the asymmetry of the unfolding primary. Day after day, Mr. Trump and his team rip Mr. DeSantis, who has mostly tried to disengage with the former president, lest he anger the sizable portion of the party that likes Mr. Trump but that he still hopes to win over.
Mr. DeSantis and most of Mr. Trump's rivals have struggled to capitalize on the former president's three criminal indictments this year, which so far have appeared to rally Republicans to his defense.
Mr. DeSantis has experienced a turbulent few weeks, replacing his campaign manager in recent days as part of the campaign's third restructuring last month. The shift included bringing in an Iowa expert from his super PAC to a top position, as Mr. DeSantis pledged to visit all 99 of the state's counties in a series of bus tours. While recording a podcast in downtown Des Moines, Mr. DeSantis predicted on Thursday that he would complete that task by October, a timeline that suggests a particularly aggressive next two months of events in the state.
"You have to earn this nomination, and you have to show up," Mr. DeSantis said on the "Ruthless" podcast, in a thinly veiled reference to Mr. Trump. "You have to debate. You've got to be willing to answer questions."
Flipping pork chops at a grill station sponsored by the Pork Producer trade association, a traditional stop for presidential aspirants, Mr. DeSantis smiled and chatted with prominent Iowa Republicans, including Senator Joni Ernst, Representative Zach Nunn and Gov. Kim Reynolds.
When Mr. Trump arrived less than an hour later, he packed the area with Florida politicians, who worked the grill as he signed hats and shook hands. A spokesman, Steven Cheung, said that the campaign spent a total of $ 20,000 buying food and drinks for fairgoers at the pork tent and beer hall.
"We got pork that's more well done than Ron DeSantis," said Representative Matt Gaetz, a former DeSantis ally who is backing Mr. Trump and was wearing a "Florida man" shirt.
"I want my president to be the biggest American chest thumper out there," said Representative Brian Mast of Florida, who came to Iowa to campaign for Mr. Trump. "If you cross him, he will slit your throat, and I get that out of President Trump."
Everywhere Mr. Trump traveled, he was surrounded by large crowds of cheering supporters angling for selfies and signatures.
As Mr. DeSantis toured the fairgrounds, some people shouted positive encouragement ("We love you, Governor!," "Go get 'em, Ron!"), to which Mr. DeSantis often responded with a smile or a wave. Others jeered him, some deploying Mr. Trump's favored nickname of "DeSanctimonious," which Mr. DeSantis ignored. One woman hurled an expletive at him, as he carried his young daughter on his shoulders.
Mr. DeSantis, a former college baseball player, tried his hand at some fair games, including the milk jug toss. He and his family won at least two giant stuffed Pikachus and what appeared to be a toy koala.
Mr. Trump leads Mr. DeSantis by 24 points among likely Republican caucusgoers, a substantial advantage but one that's 10 percentage points lower than the commanding position he holds with Republicans nationwide. Every other candidate was in single digits in the recent New York Times/Siena College polls, including Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador who on Saturday sported a shirt that read: "Underestimate me -- that'll be fun."
The fair can bring surprise encounters for attendees and politicians alike. Former Vice President Mike Pence at one point this week was asked to sign a scavenger hunt list for a fairgoer. (He fulfilled: "Picture of the team with a celebrity.") Vivek Ramaswamy, the entrepreneur, belted out several verses from Eminem's "Lose Yourself" after a question-and-answer session with Ms. Reynolds.
Almost every candidate accepted Ms. Reynolds's invitation to her "fair-side chats" -- with the notable exception of Mr. Trump, who has criticized Ms. Reynolds for her plans to stay neutral in the primary and has tried to take credit for her election.
Mr. Trump did not mention Ms. Reynolds in his brief speech at the Steer N' Stein beer building, which had a "MAGA Meal Day" special that included a double cheeseburger, "freedom fries" and a Coke for $ 24.
"We don't want to take any chances," Mr. Trump told the crowd, saying Iowans were "very special to me." "We'll be back," he said.
Riding the Ferris wheel, high above the fairgrounds, Mr. Ramaswamy peered down to see Mr. Trump waving goodbye to his crowd and ducking into his awaiting vehicle.
Mr. Ramaswamy, who had held his own event at the same spot the night before, wasn't impressed with the size of Mr. Trump's audience.
"There he is," Mr. Ramaswamy said with a straight face. "My crowd was actually -- might have been -- a little bigger."

'We're All Water-Bottle Freaks': [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Americans are drinking more water. How best to contain it: That's the burning question.
Carrie Frost is well equipped for hydration. A registered nurse and a mother of two from Colorado, she estimates that her family has accumulated "upward of 25 to 30" reusable flasks at home for keeping cold drinks: flasks large and small, of various designs and colors, with a straw and without. But last month, as she sat in 90-degree heat at her son's travel baseball tournament, she drank from a plastic water bottle that she had purchased for $ 3 at a local grocery store.
"Convenience," she said, laughing, as she tried to piece together why, once again, she was not using one of her many beverage containers. "I guess we're just a lazy society."
Americans are drinking a lot of water, but they are on the fence about how best to do it. More than $ 2 billion in reusable water bottles were sold in the United States in 2022, up from around $ 1.5 billion in 2020, according to Greg Williamson, the president of CamelBak, which is a maker of reusable bottles.
And sales of single-serving water bottles have been rising steadily, too, reaching 11.3 billion gallons in 2022, according to the most recent data from the Beverage Marketing Association, which tracks beverage sales.
In other words, consumers are spending billions of dollars a year on reusable bottles to stay hydrated and then buying bottled water anyway, even as faucet water remains free.
"Faucet?" said Jason Taylor from Georgia, whose son was playing the same Birmingham baseball tournament. "Faucet? I haven't drunk from the faucet since I was 18." He had heard stories about tainted water, like in Flint, Mich., and did not trust the faucet water at the hotel, he said, so he filled his reusable flask with ice from the hotel and poured bottled water over it. The hotel ice he trusted; the faucet water there, not so much.
Beverage consumption is in a fluid period. Americans are moving away from empty sugar calories but are still hooked on the convenience of a chilled plastic bottle from the corner-store fridge. So we are amassing containers, single-use and reusable, in kitchen cabinets and landfills alike.
Sales of reusable water bottles "are absolutely skyrocketing," said Jessica Heiges, a sustainability consultant based in Berkeley, Calif., where she recently completed a Ph.D. in the creation of waste-free systems. But, she added, people who fill their reusable flasks with water from a bottle have not fully embraced the environmental proposition.
"They are not all the way there or are not fully convinced," Dr. Heiges said. And, she noted, reusable water bottles take resources to make, so having too many isn't great for the environment, either. "You can find them at every Goodwill and Salvation Army. People are overflowing with them."
Alaina Waldrop, in Birmingham, has around 20 water bottles, as precious to her as purses, she said: "You have a decent water bottle and you get sick of it, or you're used to seeing it all the time, and find a new one that's pretty or it's a new color or it holds more water or fits in a cup holder better."
Ms. Waldrop, 20, works at Dick's Sporting Goods, about a mile from Birmingham's baseball fields. The store has multiple displays of reusable flasks, featuring major brands like Yeti and Hydro Flask. A display of Stanley flasks ( $ 45 each) came with a sign: limit four per customer. "They're so popular," Ms. Waldrop said. "I bought one for my mom and one for my sister. We're all water-bottle freaks. We all have this obsession. I wish it made more sense but it doesn't."
She tends to fill her bottles at home with filtered water but doesn't trust faucets on the go, so she buys single-serving bottles at the gas station or convenience store and pours that water into her reusable container. "I drink whatever is in the plastic and then I throw the plastic away," she said with a laugh. Why not simply drink all the water from the plastic bottle she just purchased? "It doesn't stay cold for as long," she said.
In practice, there may be little difference in quality or safety between bottled water and tap water, said Ronnie Levin, an instructor and expert in American public drinking water at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. "It's often just some random tap filling those water bottles," Ms. Levin said. "Monitoring of bottled water is somewhere between zero and not routine."
When putting bottled water in the flask, "you're not necessarily getting anything better, except that you're now polluting the environment."
In the baking heat at the baseball fields, a line had formed at a snack shack that sold water for $ 3 and charged $ 2 for ice in a Styrofoam cup. Steps away was a refillable filtered-water tap that was used by some people but had no line. Maybe that's because the filtered tap was free.
Water has become popular enough that it is often as or more expensive than soda, despite having less substance -- in the form of sugar -- to offer. At a handful of nearby convenience stores, the prices of water and soda were neck and neck; at Walgreens, bottles of Dr Pepper and other sodas sold at $ 4 for two, as did bottles of Dasani and Aquafina water.
Michael Bellas, the chairman and chief executive of the Beverage Marketing Company, said that bottled water remained far less expensive if purchased in bulk, at Costco, say, or the supermarket. But prices rise sharply for single-serving bottles when the retailer has a thirsty audience on the go, he noted.
"The airports just soak you," Mr. Bellas said.
At the Hudson store at the Birmingham airport, 20-ounce bottles of Dasani water and Smartwater (both owned by the Coca-Cola Company) cost $ 4.29 with tax, while all the 20-ounce sodas (Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite) cost $ 4.09.
"Everyone has to hydrate, and people think it makes their skin look nice," Kim Shoemaker, a Hudson employee, said of water. "No sugar, no chemicals, no additives." Ms. Shoemaker, 60, said she bought cases of water at Costco and kept single-serving bottles in every room of her home, but also owned many reusable flasks. "Oh, my gosh, probably about six," she said. "I don't use them. I don't know why."
Just outside the Hudson store was a water dispenser for reusable containers, its water filtered and free of charge and mostly going unused.
Out at the baseball fields, Ms. Frost, who had traveled from Colorado for the tournament, said she had family members who didn't understand why a person would spend on a reusable water container and single-serving water bottles and not just fill a cup from the tap.
"Ask my husband," she offered. "He thinks it's the stupidest thing in the world."
To which her husband, Spencer Frost, gruffly added: "Just drink from the hose."

The Iowa State Fair Saw Many GOP Candidates but Only One Trump

DES MOINES, Iowa — The crowd cheered. The pork was charred. And then someone shouted at former President Donald Trump, asking him to identify his biggest challenger in the 2024 Republican primary.
“Don’t see him,” Trump replied.
Trump signaled that he was looking past his leading rival, Ron DeSantis, on Saturday, as the two candidates converged at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. But his campaign team took every opportunity to needle the Florida governor.
Though the two candidates never crossed paths, Trump’s appearance was scheduled to coincide with DeSantis’ visit. Trump engineered a boisterous arrival, which included his private plane buzzing overhead, as DeSantis finished flipping pork chops. And Trump brought with him a bevy of Florida House members who had endorsed him over their own governor.
It was a rare moment of side-by-side comparison for Trump and his main opponent, and the mob of supporters following Trump’s every move underscored his superior standing. Trump leads DeSantis by an average of more than 30 percentage points nationally, though his margin is slightly smaller in Iowa — a gap that his rivals hope will narrow, as the criminal cases against him proceed. The first contest in 2024 is widely seen as the best opportunity to slow Trump’s march to the nomination.
Trump has repeatedly tried to assert his dominance as the front-runner, citing his polling advantage in social media posts and nearly every speech. But the overlapping appearances Saturday marked just the latest instance of Trump’s trying to overshadow DeSantis in Iowa, a sign of how his team views DeSantis: as his lone serious rival.
The two men cut strikingly different paths at the fairgrounds, as they wound their way through the pens of pigs, past the 600-pound sculpture of a cow carved in butter, and stands selling local delicacies, like deep-fried balls of bacon and cheese.
DeSantis, joined by his wife, Casey, and their three children, wore jeans and what has become his standard Iowa-casual fare of a custom-made, short sleeve button-down fishing shirt with his name and title emblazoned on his chest. He rode the Ferris wheel, played fair games and crashed bumper cars.
Trump took to the fairgrounds in a navy suit, with cuff links, and was greeted by a throng of cheering supporters at every stop. He signed hats, waved to the crowds and petted a goat before being driven to the Steer N’ Stein building, where he gave brief remarks.
It is not clear when the two men will be in the same place at the same time. Touting his sizable polling lead, Trump has said it would be “stupid” for him to attend this month’s first debate of the primary, in which DeSantis and the rest of his rivals have struggled to gain traction.
But on Saturday, there was plenty of old-school politicking and political theater. At one point, a plane circled the fairgrounds with a “Be likable, Ron!” banner trailing behind. The banner had two inside jabs: The first was a reference to leaked 2018 debate preparations in which DeSantis was instructed to write the word “likable” in front of him. The second was the exclamation point, which was designed to look like the logo of a previous Florida governor Trump dispatched in 2016: Jeb Bush.
And before Trump took the stage, his team handed out leaflets attacking DeSantis for his position on agricultural issues, calling him an “utter catastrophe” for farmers.
The handouts were a reminder of the asymmetry of the unfolding primary. Day after day, Trump and his team rip DeSantis, who has mostly tried to disengage with the former president, lest he anger the sizable portion of the party that likes Trump but that he still hopes to win over.
DeSantis and most of Trump’s rivals have struggled to capitalize on the former president’s three criminal indictments this year, which so far have appeared to rally Republicans to his defense.
DeSantis has experienced a turbulent few weeks, replacing his campaign manager in recent days as part of the campaign’s third restructuring in the last month. The shift included bringing in an Iowa expert from his super PAC to a top position, as DeSantis pledged to visit all 99 of the state’s counties in a series of bus tours. While recording a podcast in downtown Des Moines, DeSantis predicted Thursday that he would complete that task by October, a timeline that suggests a particularly aggressive next two months of events in the state.
“You have to earn this nomination, and you have to show up,” DeSantis said on the “Ruthless” podcast, in a thinly veiled reference to Trump. “You have to debate. You’ve got to be willing to answer questions.”
Flipping pork chops at a grill station sponsored by the Pork Producer trade association, a traditional stop for presidential aspirants, DeSantis smiled and chatted with prominent Iowa Republicans, including Sen. Joni Ernst, Rep. Zach Nunn and Gov. Kim Reynolds.
When Trump arrived less than an hour later, he packed the area with Florida politicians, who worked the grill as he signed hats and shook hands. A spokesperson, Steven Cheung, said that the campaign spent a total of $20,000 buying food and drinks for fairgoers at the pork tent and beer hall.
“We got pork that’s more well done than Ron DeSantis,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz, a former DeSantis ally who is backing Trump and was wearing a “Florida man” shirt.
“I want my president to be the biggest American chest thumper out there,” said Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, who came to Iowa to campaign for Trump. “If you cross him, he will slit your throat, and I get that out of President Trump.”
Everywhere Trump traveled, he was surrounded by large crowds of cheering supporters angling for selfies and signatures.
As DeSantis toured the fairgrounds, some people shouted positive encouragement (“We love you, Governor!,” “Go get ’em, Ron!”), to which DeSantis often responded with a smile or a wave. Others jeered him, some deploying Trump’s favored nickname of “DeSanctimonious,” which DeSantis ignored. One woman hurled an expletive at him, as he carried his young daughter on his shoulders.
DeSantis, a former college baseball player, tried his hand at some fair games, including the milk jug toss. He and his family won at least two giant stuffed Pikachus and what appeared to be a toy koala.
Trump leads DeSantis by 24 percentage points among likely Republican caucusgoers, a substantial advantage but one that’s 10 percentage points lower than the commanding position he holds with Republicans nationwide. Every other candidate was in single digits in the recent New York Times/Siena College polls, including Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador who on Saturday sported a shirt that read: “Underestimate me — that’ll be fun.”

Ramaswamy, who had held his own event at the same spot the night before, wasn’t impressed with the size of Trump’s audience.
“There he is,” Ramaswamy said with a straight face. “My crowd was actually — might have been — a little bigger.”

She's Antiwar, but Her Advice To Russians Is to Just Accept It: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ksenia Sobchak, one of the best known media figures still in Russia, says her fatalistic stance just reflects a grim reality. Some liberals call her a Kremlin stooge, while hawks see her as disloyal.
Emerging from a friend's Maserati on southern Spain's Mediterranean coast, Ksenia Sobchak wants the world to know: Back home in Russia, fighting for change is futile.
"There is no resistance, nor can there be any," she says. "This has to be understood."
She can point to ample proof to support her pessimism: Thousands of Russians have been arrested for protesting the war. Hundreds of journalists are in exile. Opposition leaders are serving yearslong prison terms.
All this sacrifice has failed to stop President Vladimir V. Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and, in Ms. Sobchak's view, these fruitless efforts only add weight to her message: Liberal Russians should find ways to live with Mr. Putin's war because there's nothing they can do about it.
Ms. Sobchak is one of the best-known media figures still based in Russia and the daughter of one of Mr. Putin's first political mentors. She is able to widely communicate her call for Russians to just cope with the war, though her stance has also made her profoundly unpopular among two distinctly different sets.
A former reality-TV host who remade herself as a liberal politician and journalist, Ms. Sobchak, 41, is reviled by many opposition activists who see her as a Kremlin stooge -- and by pro-war hawks who consider her disloyal.
But she is also a totemic figure of the Putin era: a celebrity influencer and media entrepreneur whose rise has tracked the acceptance of Mr. Putin's rollback of democracy -- and, now, his war -- by swaths of the Western-oriented, urban elite.
Her story helps illuminate some of the central debates taking place about wartime Russia. Given Mr. Putin's apparatus of repression, is it appropriate to expect Russians to look for ways to resist? Can the millions of antiwar Russians unable or unwilling to emigrate be condemned for trying to adapt to Mr. Putin's system and seeking a sense of normalcy?
Back in 2018, Ms. Sobchak ran for president, warning it would be a "tragedy" if Mr. Putin were re-elected but also urging people not to "demonize" him. Now, she says that she opposes the invasion of Ukraine; but on her hugely popular social media accounts, the invasion is akin to a natural disaster -- something to be endured, rather than a political choice that can be challenged.
"Putin made a pretty certain, clear decision," Ms. Sobchak said in a recent interview while on vacation at a Spanish seaside resort. "At some point you've got to accept that you can't influence it."
To her critics, however, Ms. Sobchak's profession of powerlessness rings hollow.
Mr. Putin has known her since he was a 1990s bureaucrat working for her late father, Anatoly A. Sobchak, then the mayor of St. Petersburg and the pro-democracy politician who launched Mr. Putin's political career. Her mother is a member of Russia's Parliament; her husband is a state theater director with a column in one of the government's main online propaganda outlets.
But Ms. Sobchak says she has not seen Mr. Putin since the war began and has not tried to speak to him about the invasion. Instead, Ms. Sobchak has learned to abide the war and says she is trying to help her compatriots do the same.
On her Instagram account, with 9.5 million followers, Ms. Sobchak parades down a Moscow sidewalk showing off her combination of a vintage Chanel bag with a Russian designer dress. On her YouTube channel, where she posts celebrity interviews, a reality TV star confesses that "I lost my libido" because of the invasion. On the social messaging app Telegram, Ms. Sobchak and her team solicit help for residents of Russian border regions displaced by Ukrainian shelling.
"I believe that this is a horrific situation," she says. "But we're going to get through this time, we'll get through it together with our audience."
She says her main source of income is hosting events like birthday parties and weddings. She also sells sponsorships on her YouTube channel.
To her defenders, Ms. Sobchak is doing a service despite her compromising stance by offering alternatives to state television on platforms that are still accessible online in Russia.
Her YouTube channel also features interviews with critics of the war. Her team of journalists publishes frequent news updates to Telegram with stories that Russia's state media tend to ignore: arrests of antiwar activists, violence committed by soldiers returning from the front and human rights abuses in the southern region of Chechnya.
The war has also amplified Ms. Sobchak's status as a leading foil to Aleksei A. Navalny, the opposition leader in prison since 2021.
In 2018, Mr. Navalny was barred from the ballot in Russia's presidential election, but the Kremlin allowed Ms. Sobchak to run, giving a sheen of pluralism to the vote that delivered a fourth term for Mr. Putin.
Mr. Navalny's backers argue that Ms. Sobchak should be under Western sanctions, and see her as a Kremlin propaganda tool targeting liberal Russians turned off by the pro-war bluster on state television. Maria Pevchikh, the exiled chairwoman of Mr. Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, said Ms. Sobchak is "planting in people a feeling of their own helplessness."
"This is a very bad, very scary message," Ms. Pevchikh said in a phone interview. "It really resonates with her audience because people take some solace in this: 'There's nothing to be done."'
Ms. Sobchak denies working for the Kremlin and sees the calls from abroad for Russians to resist as misguided and immoral. The failed mutiny in June by the warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin, she says, underscores that whatever comes after Mr. Putin could be even worse.
"Where did the idea come from that after Putin, the 'beautiful Russia of the future' will arrive?" she asked, using a phrase popularized by Mr. Navalny.
Ms. Sobchak became famous as a reality-TV host in the early 2000s, then joined the Moscow street protests over election fraud in 2011. After the 2018 election, in which she came in fourth, she embraced a career as a lifestyle influencer and a journalist.
She says she last saw Mr. Putin at his annual news conference in December 2021, when American officials were already warning of an invasion. Rather than ask about the possibility of war, Ms. Sobchak questioned him about prison torture. Trying to spot her in the crowd, Mr. Putin referred to Ms. Sobchak with the informal Russian "you," signaling he knew her well.
Like many Russians, Ms. Sobchak dismissed the possibility of Russia invading Ukraine. She wrote on Feb. 16, 2022, that "Putin looked like a mature, decent politician" amid the "hysteria in American newspapers." When Russia did attack on Feb. 24, she posted a black square on Instagram and wrote: "We are all locked in this situation now. There is no way out."
In the weeks that followed, the Kremlin forced the shutdown of most of what remained of Russian independent media, and hundreds of journalists fled Russia, fearing arrest under a new wartime censorship law. Ms. Sobchak said she cried and woke up in panic during the night.
But she did not emigrate. Doing so would have meant becoming a stranger in a foreign land "who must constantly castigate, blame and apologize for their own country."
Instead, she declared she would do what she could to continue offering content from inside Russia, even if it meant eliding sensitive topics. Asked in the interview in Spain about her feelings toward Mr. Putin, she said: "Working in Russia, I prefer not to speak about my attitude toward people who have full power in my country."
On her YouTube channel in February, Ms. Sobchak told viewers: "We decided to stay here, but also to follow the laws." She added: "There are some things that I can't say directly, and some that, unfortunately, I can't say at all."
She has also increasingly turned against Western governments and Russians in exile. Both groups, she says, dismiss the plight of antiwar Russians who have stayed behind. She also accuses Western leaders of using the war to their geopolitical advantage instead of brokering a compromise to stop the dying.
"The lives of people are simply instruments of bargaining for better positions," she said. "This is monstrous and terrible. It's the height of cynicism."
Last October, Ms. Sobchak briefly fled Russia as three employees of her media company were arrested on suspicion of extortion. For a moment, it seemed that even those personally close to Mr. Putin could be the targets of repression. But after two weeks, Ms. Sobchak returned and publicly apologized to the Putin ally whom her employees were accused of extorting. She says she made the apology "for the sake of the guys" and that she is still "fighting for their freedom."
From her Spanish vacation spot by the marina of Puerto Banús, popular with super-rich Russians, Ms. Sobchak acknowledged she was worried about being hit by Western sanctions -- but also that she could be persecuted back in Russia for her antiwar stance. She hopes to avoid both fates.
"People are born to live calm, happy lives," Ms. Sobchak said. "People are not all born heroes."

MARBELLA, Spain — Emerging from a friend’s Maserati on southern Spain’s Mediterranean coast, Ksenia Sobchak wants the world to know this: Back home in Russia, fighting for change is futile.
“There is no resistance, nor can there be any,” she said. “This has to be understood.”
She can point to ample proof to support her pessimism: Thousands of Russians have been arrested for protesting the war. Hundreds of journalists are in exile. Opposition leaders are serving yearslong prison terms.
All this sacrifice has failed to stop President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and, in Sobchak’s view, these fruitless efforts only add weight to her message: Liberal Russians should find ways to live with Putin’s war because there’s nothing they can do about it.
Sobchak is one of the best-known media figures still based in Russia and the daughter of one of Putin’s first political mentors. She is able to widely communicate her call for Russians to just cope with the war, though her stance has also made her profoundly unpopular among two distinctly different sets.
A former reality TV host who remade herself as a liberal politician and journalist, Sobchak, 41, is reviled by many opposition activists who see her as a Kremlin stooge — and by pro-war hawks who consider her disloyal.
But she is also a totemic figure of the Putin era: a celebrity influencer and media entrepreneur whose rise has tracked the acceptance of Putin’s rollback of democracy — and now his war — by swaths of the Western-oriented, urban elite.
Her story helps illuminate some of the central debates taking place about wartime Russia. Given Putin’s apparatus of repression, is it appropriate to expect Russians to look for ways to resist? Can the millions of anti-war Russians unable or unwilling to emigrate be condemned for trying to adapt to Putin’s system and seeking a sense of normalcy?
Back in 2018, Sobchak ran for president, warning it would be a “tragedy” if Putin were reelected but also urging people not to “demonize” him. Now she says that she opposes the invasion of Ukraine; but on her hugely popular social media accounts, the invasion is akin to a natural disaster — something to be endured, rather than a political choice that can be challenged.
“Putin made a pretty certain, clear decision,” Sobchak said in a recent interview while on vacation at a Spanish seaside resort. “At some point, you’ve got to accept that you can’t influence it.”
To her critics, however, Sobchak’s profession of powerlessness rings hollow.
Putin has known her since he was a 1990s bureaucrat working for her late father, Anatoly Sobchak, then the mayor of St. Petersburg and the pro-democracy politician who launched Putin’s political career. Her mother is a member of Russia’s parliament; her husband is a state theater director with a column in one of the government’s main online propaganda outlets.
But Ksenia Sobchak said she has not seen Putin since the war began and has not tried to speak to him about the invasion. Instead, Sobchak has learned to abide the war and said she is trying to help her compatriots do the same.
On her Instagram account, with 9.5 million followers, Sobchak parades down a Moscow sidewalk showing off her combination of a vintage Chanel bag with a Russian designer dress. On her YouTube channel, where she posts celebrity interviews, a reality TV star confesses that “I lost my libido” because of the invasion. On the social messaging app Telegram, Sobchak and her team solicit help for residents of Russian border regions displaced by Ukrainian shelling.
“I believe that this is a horrific situation,” she said. “But we’re going to get through this time. We’ll get through it together with our audience.”
She said her main source of income is hosting events like birthday parties and weddings. She also sells sponsorships on her YouTube channel.
To her defenders, Sobchak is doing a service despite her compromising stance by offering alternatives to state television on platforms that are still accessible online in Russia.
Her YouTube channel also features interviews with critics of the war. Her team of journalists publishes frequent news updates to Telegram with stories that Russia’s state media tend to ignore: arrests of anti-war activists, violence committed by soldiers returning from the front and human rights abuses in the southern region of Chechnya.
The war has also amplified Sobchak’s status as a leading foil to Alexei Navalny, the opposition leader in prison since 2021.
In 2018, Navalny was banned from the ballot in Russia’s presidential election, but the Kremlin allowed Sobchak to run, giving a sheen of pluralism to the vote that delivered a fourth term for Putin.
Navalny’s backers argue that Sobchak should be under Western sanctions and see her as a Kremlin propaganda tool targeting liberal Russians turned off by the pro-war bluster on state television. Maria Pevchikh, the exiled chair of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, said Sobchak is “planting in people a feeling of their own helplessness.”
“This is a very bad, very scary message,” Pevchikh said in a phone interview. “It really resonates with her audience because people take some solace in this: ‘There’s nothing to be done.’”

Skip the Mixing. Say Hello to Hard Juice.: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Once considered only a passable mixer, juice is finding its way into canned alcoholic drinks.
Since its introduction in 1963, SunnyD has been a favorite for generations of American children, served as an after-school treat or at the end of soccer or baseball practice.
But it's also been a longtime favorite on the house party circuit, which is why Harvest Hill Beverage Company, the brand's owner since 2016, recently introduced a canned SunnyD Vodka Seltzer. "Our consumers have been using SunnyD and juices as mixers for years," said Ilene Bergenfeld, Harvest Hill's chief marketing officer. "We just made it more convenient."
Harvest Hill is one of a number of breweries and beverage companies breaking into the still-emerging hard juice market. Last year, Molson Coors Beverage Company partnered with the Coca-Cola Company to create Simply Spiked, which contains Simply Beverages' peach and lemonade juices.
The same month that SunnyD Vodka Seltzer hit the market, New Belgium Brewing released its Wild Nectar line, featuring tropical juice mixes, including strawberry guava and passion fruit lime. Next year, Absolut Vodka and Ocean Spray will join the fray with a canned vodka cranberry cocktail.
For manufacturers, hard juice is part of a natural progression toward alcoholic beverages built around big flavors rather than an alcohol category like beer or wine. "It's a blurry space, and that's the point," Shaun Belongie, the chief marketing officer for New Belgium, said in an email. "Drinkers just want something delicious and refreshing."
These hard juices are supposed to be displayed with other alcoholic beverages in stores, but some people are concerned that they could be courting underage drinkers.
Even as hard seltzers rack up nearly $ 4.2 billion in sales, according to NielsenIQ, leaning on household brands and bold fruit combinations might offer companies a novel recipe for additional customers, said Dave Williams, the vice president of analytics and consumer insights for Bump Williams Consulting, which focuses on the alcoholic beverage industry.
"These new beverages have done a good job of resonating with new legal drinking age consumers," he said.
That's certainly been the case for Two Robbers Seltzer Company in Philadelphia, which released its first hard seltzers in 2019. This spring, after noticing that consumers were mixing juices into their hard seltzers, the company introduced a hard juice that is 8 percent alcohol by volume and contains 160 to 175 calories per 12-ounce serving.
At the company's bar in the Fishtown neighborhood of Philadelphia, Two Robbers' mango Double Punch hard juice might be served with a Tajín rim. "You're getting a big glass of a beautiful juicy drink," said Vivek Nayar, a founder.
For its hard juice line, New Belgium produced more than 40 prototypes before settling on about 15 percent juice in hopes of creating a drink "reminiscent of a tropical cocktail you might enjoy on a beach," Mr. Belongie said.
That percentage might seem a bit low to someone like Juan Cordón Toledano, the Spanish-born owner of SunDaze, which aims to reinvent the mimosa with its line of lightly carbonated, fermented-juice cocktails. With at least 70 percent juice, Mr. Toledano said, "we have the highest juice content in a ready-to-drink cocktail."
And for beer brewers who have made inroads with fruity and hazy I.P.A.s, hard juices present an opportunity to reach an entirely different audience. In 2020, Homes Brewery in Ann Arbor, Mich., established Troobado and, with it, the fruit-saturated Smooj line of so-called hard smoothies.
At more than 200 calories per 12-ounce serving, it makes for a rich treat, said Tommy Kennedy, the owner of both companies. But then again, "real fruit will have calories." Smooj has since found a younger following, with customers embracing it for the same reason they started adding juice to their cocktails in the first place.
"You just don't taste the alcohol," Mr. Kennedy said.

A Broader Repertoire for Diverse Audiences: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: At recent Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra performances, visibly diverse crowds took in programming new to the ensemble.
For the past 10 months, the back side of David Geffen Hall has greeted passers-by with Nina Chanel Abney's installation "San Juan Heal." Its bold, color-blocked illustrations pay tribute to the largely Black and Puerto Rican neighborhood that was torn down to make way for Lincoln Center in the mid-20th century.
"San Juan Heal" was a way of acknowledging this performing-arts campus's original sin. When it was announced, Henry Timms, the center's president and chief executive, said, "We've been very intentional about thinking about different voices, different audiences, more people seeing themselves at Lincoln Center."
But as the months passed, I began to wonder: Are there more people of color on the building than inside it? If the installation is both a nod to the past and a hope for the future, then what is Lincoln Center doing to get there?
The Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra, which has taken up residence at Geffen Hall for two and a half weeks as part of Lincoln Center's Summer for the City programming, has a lot of ideas on that front. With so few concerts, it has little time to capture audience interest, but it also has more room to be conceptually agile.
Near the end of July, the ensemble's concerts began with a premiere by the Iraqi American composer Amir ElSaffar, featuring his Two Rivers ensemble, and continued with programs -- led by Thomas Wilkins, Gemma New and Jonathon Heyward -- that featured contemporary works about identity and equity while otherwise sticking to the orchestra's unofficial remit of familiar, easy-on-the-ears repertoire. The performances ranged from workaday to exhilarating.
Wilkins, in opening remarks, spoke of composers who feel "comfortable in their skin" as a kind of artistic self-actualization, and he and Heyward gave a platform to Black composers: Adolphus Hailstork, Xavier Foley, Jessie Montgomery and Fela Sowande.
At Wilkins's concert, Foley's "For Justice and Peace" -- written for double bass (Foley), violin (the concertmaster Ruggero Allifranchini) and string ensemble -- spurred into action with flashy passagework after an elegiac opening. In Sowande's African Suite (1944), the musicians tossed genial Nigerian melodies to one another with infectious spirit. But it was in the finale, Hailstork's Symphony No. 1, that Wilkins inspired excellence in them and conjured a heady mix of timbres like thrashing beams of light and glistening surges of sound.
Heyward opened his program with Montgomery's "Records of a Vanishing City," a tone poem that swirled with the music -- most conspicuously, Miles Davis -- that she heard growing up on the Lower East Side. Amid the piece's slippery, chimerical atmosphere, a solo clarinet, played by Jon Manasse, emerged with sweetly mellow innocence, like a child's voice in an urban variation of Barber's "Knoxville: Summer of 1915." As it happened, a vivacious account of Barber's Violin Concerto followed.
Last year's Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra concerts featured a diverse lineup of composers too, but the choices -- William Grant Still, Joseph Boulogne and Florence Price -- have sometimes crowded out contemporary composers. The recent programs, though, reflect an evolution in a more substantive direction toward true inclusivity.
Heyward, in his first concert with the orchestra since being named its next music director, displayed a natural rapport with the audience, an appealing podium manner and a crisp way with downbeats. Stiff at first in the Montgomery, he gradually relaxed into more organic gestures in the Barber and Schumann's "Rhenish" Symphony.
At the moment, though, there is a gulf between Heyward's intentions and his output. He spoke of "absolute joy" before the Schumann, then delivered something more like breathy contentment. Earthiness teetered on earthbound in the symphony's exultant depictions of the Rhineland.
Despite this orchestra's name, Mozart made just one appearance in the three recent programs, when New conducted his "Prague" Symphony, a sterling example of his mature style, woven together with unmistakable snatches of the operatic masterpieces he wrote around the same time, "Le Nozze di Figaro" and "Don Giovanni."
New cultivated a fine core of color and volume and shifted from it in gradations, though she didn't necessarily mine the Andante's introspection or the Presto's drama. She also led Mendelssohn's Piano Concerto No. 1 and Sarah Gibson's "warp & weft," a mysterious, openhearted, at times astringent tribute to the feminist art movement of the 1970s that fought to elevate so-called women's work from craft to fine art.
The soloists on these three evenings brought personal flair, if not the last word in technique, to their showpieces. Foley's adroit, sly, softly powerful style in Bottesini's Double Bass Concerto No. 2 drew listeners to the edge of their seats despite a stylistically questionable habit of bending notes. Stewart Goodyear took off like gangbusters in the Mendelssohn piano concerto -- fast, efficient, driving -- and put aside elegance for hair-raising thrills. In Barber's rapturous Violin Concerto, Simone Lamsma smoothed over the tension brought by triplet rhythms in the first movement's long, sumptuous melody; her tendency to play on the sharp edge of the pitch gave her tone an uncanny brilliance that kept it from nestling into the warm orchestral textures.
Shanta Thake, Lincoln Center's artistic leader, came onstage before each concert to welcome the audience and lead it in what she called a "ritual." Last year, this call-and-response exchange felt like a way to speak healing into existence after the pandemic. This year, the audience's disengagement from the exercise deepened with each concert.
Arguably, Wilkins and Heyward are the ones creating community by enlarging the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra's repertoire. And if the delighted reactions of the large, diverse crowds -- who supplied enthusiastic applause and even scattered standing ovations between pieces -- are any indication, it's working.

Full text: I've made a special contribution to hip-hop, and I feel like that gets overlooked a lot of times. Hip-hop is Black culture. People say, "Oh, you make house music, a.k.a white people music." I'm like, honey, no. House music is Black music. Everything I do is in the spirit of hip-hop.
My first memory of hip-hop was O.D.B. on Mariah Carey's "Fantasy" remix. I was like 2, going on 3. And Lil' Kim's verse on "All About the Benjamins." The audacity was just so fab. I remember the video with the fisheye lens, the see-through dress and the blonde wig. And she started off with: "What the bloodclaat?/Wanna bumble with the bee, huh?/Throw a hex on the whole family." I didn't know what a hex was until I was maybe 16, but I could spit that [expletive] word for word.
I was a theater kid, and Lil Wayne, for sure, was like a thespian. It was theatrical and the jokes were funny. "Cannon" is probably one of the best Lil Wayne verses ever. [Raps "Cannon" for 30 seconds]
But my favorite rapper of all time is Styles P, from hearing the Lox at block parties. Then we had the DatPiff era, so I would download like, "Ghost in the Machine." I just like how unrehearsed he is. And the swag. He was talking to you rather than trying to create a fantastical world. We actually have a song together on my first mixtape. He did it for free. I've done collabs with other male rappers that will probably never see the light of day because I wouldn't sign their record deal. Like, damn, Yeezy -- I loved you my entire life and that's what you do?
I started rapping because I had this boyfriend who rapped and they would do these cyphers. If your bars were wack, they would, like, snatch the blunt from you, you know? I skipped the cypher for like two weeks and came back with a vengeance. I had to learn all these words for "firearm." I wrote "Seventeen" over that Ladytron beat and when they passed me the blunt that day, I came out with: "I'm not the don diva/I'm beyond ya don skeezers/I get cake from quick chicks with long heaters." They was like, "Ohhh. Shorty, you can rap! You should record that!"
The very first record that I ever recorded was into a microphone in a sock in this guy's closet in between all these Supreme jackets. Two weeks later, I was featured on the Fader blog.
I blew up overnight and then it was just kind of like, OK, I have a job to do now. I think that all of that theatrical training definitely helped. When it came to "212," that white girl Valley Girl voice, I was really just making fun of dumb bitches who come to New York for like two years and are like, I'm a New Yorker!
I think that everyone at XL Recordings forgot that I was 17. There was no mentorship. Everybody kind of abandoned me and expected me to know what they wanted. At the same time, they had just signed Odd Future, who were super duper crass. I won't lie -- I was so jealous just watching them put all this love into Odd Future. Just to see them be given the support to be kids. It's a classic tale of boys can do whatever they want, but girls need to be like, prim and proper. I sent "212" in to XL and they dropped me. It was 100 percent a bunch of misogynoir.
I was thinking maybe I should go get a G.E.D. and go to college. Then I get this phone call from Nick Grimshaw on BBC Radio 1, and he's played it like a million times. I didn't even know what BBC Radio 1 was. And then very quickly you go from getting paid $ 150 and a bottle of Smirnoff to perform to getting like €5,000 at some weird charity event. I'd never had 5,000 anything all at once, ever. All I could think was, I'm going to get a weave and a laptop.
One thing leads to another, and then I'm at Karl Lagerfeld's house. I didn't even know who Karl Lagerfeld was when he invited me to perform at his house in Paris. I didn't know what Coachella was when I got booked for Coachella. That Coachella date in 2012, it was like, all right, I'm here. I'm a star.
Jimmy Iovine, the very first day I met him, he said to me, "The best thing you can do for a woman is get the [expletive] out of her way." He actually bought me my first, like, three pairs of Louboutins, my first Chanel bag, my first real bottle of perfume. He was always a gentleman and he always thought my jokes were funny.
"212" was such an anomaly that no one has been able to successfully build upon it outside of me. What I see is people doing an Azealia Banks impression, and that is partially due to just the belief that a woman couldn't be the mastermind behind the sound, the aesthetic, the everything. I'm still alive, girls.
There's no magic in hip-hop now. Hip-hop has been taken from us and used as a weapon against us. No one is talking about anything. Just for the record: All these little new rap girls -- they really suck.

I Chose to Put On Lipstick for All This?: [Style Desk]

Full text: Lunch with an older friend prompts a writer to try some seemingly outdated stratagems for attracting a mate.
I don't usually wear lipstick. Or heels. Or pants with zippers.
Post-pandemic, post-babies and post-divorce, I've grown selective about how I spend my energy and time, and cobbling together a costume of femininity takes a significant amount of both. But I wonder if this laissez-faire perspective (ahem: sweatpants in public) has kept me in relationship purgatory, where I'm never actively dating but still secretly hoping someone special will intuit the beauty beyond my sweats.
On a recent lunch date with a friend in her 80s, I listened with mounting dread as she lamented her own divorce, which happened 30 years ago. With tears in her eyes, she said there'd been no one serious in her life since her marriage ended, and she was resigned to dying alone.
All at once I was looking across the table at my future self. There I was, four decades later, mourning the second-act relationship that had never happened. There I was, ordering Diet Coke refills in a suburban Carrabba's, convinced my marriage had been my one shot at love and that I had wasted it on the wrong person. There I was, telling a friend half my age that sometimes, no matter how much you want it, love may never show up.
I left the restaurant shaken. My life was half over, and I was on the express train to Lonelyville: a singles room in the nursing home. Ravioli leftovers for one. The distant, dreamlike memory of what it felt like to be touched. I had to change course, but it wasn't as simple as just "getting back out there."
The end of my marriage hadn't been an anomaly -- I had never had a healthy, long-term relationship, and I couldn't understand why. Did I have unrealistic expectations? A fear of intimacy? A broken partner picker? All I knew for sure was that the common denominator in every failed relationship was me.
That night, while swiping past the Instagram posts of partnered family and friends, a sponsored video stopped me mid-scroll. A hunky New Zealander had a question for me. Yes, me. Did I know how to inspire emotional attachment in the man of my choice? (I did not.) He went on to say that creating emotional attachment was the only way to form a lasting relationship. While I had thought of love as something that happened to me, like a natural disaster, this guy was saying that lasting relationships were intentional bonds cultivated by people with a very particular set of skills, none of which I seemed to possess.
I signed up for a relationship boot camp. The first assignment was to read a 102-page PDF that revealed how to "capture his attention and win his heart" using proven principles of attraction. Perfect, I thought. I'll finally know what to say on a first date, how to sniff out psychopaths before I sleep with them, and how to shepherd that initial spark of attraction into something deeper.
But when I opened the PDF, I found it packed ... with lipstick.
Chanel Rouge Coco Bloom. MAC Ruby Woo. Wet 'n' Wild Shining Hibiscus.
"Principle #1: Have Luscious Lips!"
When a woman is aroused, her blood flow increases, making her lips appear redder and fuller -- AKA nature's lipstick! Studies show that men prefer women who wear lipstick over women who don't!
I stared at the words, my un-luscious lips agape, wondering if this "boot camp" was nothing more than a collection of Cosmopolitan-style beauty hacks written by ChatGPT.
"Principle #2: Have Wide Hips!"
Over millennia, men learned that coupling with wide-hipped women led to more successful procreative outcomes!
Fine, I thought. Wear makeup, rock a hot bod and swallow every media-inspired standard of beauty. But should I mention my kids on a first date?
"Principle #3: Stick Out Your Sexy Bum!"
It went on like this for 102 pages. I laugh-cried my way through the list, texting pictures of the "principles" to friends and mentally calculating my boot camp refund.
But in the days that followed, I became slightly obsessed with the principles, particularly their "scientific" explanations. Let me be clear: the principles were absurd. They were comically archaic and offensively exclusive to "feminine women seeking masculine men." But I was spellbound by the idea that attraction could be sparked by something as simple as smudging some color on my mouth.
What if our cultural standards of attractiveness really could be traced back along evolutionary lines to their original source, like a rumor that's mostly false but partly true? Maybe what had been missing in my quest to attract the right partner was biological. Maybe, without lipstick, I was invisible to men! It would be impossible to inspire emotional attachment in someone who hadn't even noticed me, right?
I started wearing lipstick on Zoom calls for work. Bright lipstick. Arousal lipstick. I strutted across the grocery store parking lot to create the illusion of wider hips. At my son's baseball practices, I stuck out my "sexy bum" just to see what it felt like. (It felt stupid.)
I did nothing else out of the ordinary -- no makeover, no personality transplant -- but men I'd known for years started responding to me differently. For the first time since our sons started playing together, the Baseball Dads seemed aware of my existence.
Cute Dad struck up conversations during practice. Tall Dad noticed me squinting in the bleachers and positioned himself to block the sun from my view. Canadian Dad gave me a high-five and traced his fingers across my palm before letting go.
As preposterous as I initially thought the principles were, they seemed to work. For a few weeks, I felt positively witchy every time some poor sucker let me skip him in line at the self-checkout, and I waited for the attention to manifest a date. Several months later, I'm still waiting.
These days I've been getting notifications to order more lipstick, because I'm supposed to be running low, but I haven't worn lipstick in weeks. It seemed to me that the attention I got when I followed the principles wasn't leading me to a future I really wanted. Instead, it pointed to an ancient past, prompting a biological reflex that, while initially flattering, felt like a cheap substitute for a real connection. Why put on lipstick just to be reminded that what's missing in those moments of attraction is what's most essential?
According to the boot camp syllabus, I'm supposed to be bantering with men on dating apps, using compliments that double as insults because "men want to play."
You know what I want? A handsome stranger who approaches me from across a crowded room. "I couldn't help but notice your lipstick," he might say, handing me a moist toilette to wipe it off. He'll look me up and down, frowning at the too-tight jeans I can barely zip up. "Let's get out of here," he'll say. "You look like you want to slip into something more comfortable."

The Brand Stories of Our Lives: [Op-Ed]

Full text: If there's anything more American than apple pie, it's Coca-Cola, Levi's and Harley-Davidson. With faith in most American institutions -- from the government to the press to schools -- floundering, brands may be among the few things a consumerist society can still believe in.
No wonder so many of the latest movies tell the stories behind these beloved brands. Think about how many films this year are corporate biopics: "The Beanie Bubble," "Tetris," "Air," "BlackBerry" and "Flamin' Hot" (as in Cheetos). And of course, there's "Barbie," an actual sponsored ad of a movie, created with Mattel, and the first in a projected package of at least 13 product-centric movies. Whereas an earlier flurry of business-related movies focused on flawed founders and frauds (the origin stories of companies like Theranos, WeWork, Apple, Facebook), this latest wave feels downright celebratory.
Clearly there's an appeal to these behind-the-brand stories. But why now -- and what exactly are these movies celebrating?
The 1980s and '90s, for one thing, which in these movies look like a relatively golden era. It was a time before media fragmentation, when Americans shared cultural touchstones. It was a time before doomsday politics, when the social landscape still emitted a spark of optimism. It was before our A.I.-threatened gig economy, when more paths seemed open to corporate success. And in these movies, it was a time when the right nerd/ne'er-do-well/eccentric with the right combination of charm, chutzpah and ingenuity could make his or her dream come true. Could make other people believe! All you needed -- or so we'd like to think -- was the right story to sell.
And the stories told here are even true stories or somewhat true stories or a "fictionalization" inspired by "real people and real events," per "BlackBerry," (also, in this case, actually Canadian) or as "The Beanie Bubble" concedes in its onscreen disclaimer, "There are parts of the truth you just can't make up. The rest, we did." In the case of "Flamin' Hot," whose inspiring tale was punctured by an investigation by The Los Angeles Times, the story is barely true at all. But that didn't get in the way of the filmmakers, whose lead character, Richard Montañez, a former drug dealer, makes his way from janitor to marketing executive at PepsiCo. Well, what could be more American than throwing in a little myth alongside the facts? "In this world, there's no such thing as just a janitor," Montañez tells us in one of the voice-overs that tend to hum through these movies. "We all write our own stories. We create our own destinies."
This is the self-made, bootstraps way our culture likes to see itself. "I mean, that's the whole point of America, right?" runs a voice-over in "The Beanie Bubble," "Work hard, build something good, get yourself in the right place at the right time and boom!" The ending of "Tetris" shows its Russian inventor immigrating to the United States as the Pet Shop Boys intone, "Let's make lots of money."
In short, these are movies about the American dream -- alluringly set before the bubble behind that myth burst.
To make the dream work here requires a heavy dose of nostalgia and stagecraft. A central element is the greatest-hits '80s and '90s history montage of commerce and culture, brand names and generational touchstones. The opening sequence of "Air" runs through Cabbage Patch Kids, Kodak, the 1984 Apple commercial, Rubik's Cube, Mr. T, Wham! and Wendy's "Where's the beef?" In "The Beanie Bubble" we get the full '90s suite: freed Mandela, Rollerblading, O.J. Simpson, brick phones, Tonya Harding, AOL, the Spice Girls and Anita Hill. Soundtracks pump out INXS' "New Sensation," Night Ranger's "Sister Christian" and Europe's "The Final Countdown."
Success is like a video game -- usually solo player -- with the requisite risks and rewards, bonuses and bonanzas, good guys and bad ones. Play it right, and investors will go for your pitch. You'll reap a consumer bonanza. Your market share will increase. Your stock prices will rise. Your personal net worth will go through the roof!
And play is paramount, because at heart, these stories fulfill a childhood fantasy about getting all the toys and grown-up gadgets, whether plastic doll, bingeable snack, video game or supercool sneaker. The brands being celebrated are accessible things most people can acquire and accumulate -- additives and collectibles rather than necessities.
In these cinematic renditions, technology offers a future of promise. "BlackBerry" opens with a clip of Arthur C. Clarke prophesying a future in which it will be possible "for a man to conduct his business from Tahiti or Bali just as well as he could from London." Analog fetishism permeates "Air" and "Tetris," with their pixelated screens, homey VCRs, car phones, pay phones and references to things like "the tape deck in the car." A Game Boy tends to show up at least once onscreen. These are movies for kids who grew up on "Star Wars" and the kids whose parents made them watch it. They allow us to relive the days when tech felt incontrovertibly good.
Days when making good things brought not just fun and good feelings but also lots of money. By the end of "Air," Michael Jordan is a billionaire; Nike's revenue was more than $ 46.7 billion in the 2022 fiscal year. In "Flamin' Hot," one of the last lines onscreen notes with pride, "Flamin' Hot Cheetos is a billion-dollar brand." (As for the "Barbie" movie, itself a Mattel product, its box office bonanza is presumably just a fraction of the money it will make revitalizing the brand.)
It's easy to see these movies as a triumph of banality, the next step up the marketing ladder from the waning Marvel Cinematic Universe. Clearly, a shrewd business calculus plays a big part. There's a built-in audience for a wide array of recognizable and beloved I.P.
But if we set aside all cynicism over what these movies are selling, the appeal clearly rests on something more profound. These are stories in which regular people could still make it -- and make it big. Told at a time marked by a gaping absence of hope, when a longing for shared values runs deep, they provide a feel-good, reaffirming vision of what America at its best is supposed to offer. The melancholic irony is that the brands of yore are seen as the place to find all that.
The clincher scene in "Air" has Nike's marketing hotshot Sonny Vaccaro saying to Jordan, "We need you in these shoes not so you have meaning in your life but so that we have meaning in ours." How sad if that were entirely true.

Full text: New jazz and exhibition spaces, and an inaugural show curated by Jason Moran, feature the trumpeter's history, collaged onto the walls.
You can find anything in Queens. And yet for decades, the Louis Armstrong House Museum has been a well-kept secret on a quiet street in Corona. The longtime residence of the famed jazz trumpeter, singer and bandleader, it is a midcentury interior design treasure hidden behind a modest brick exterior.
The museum's new extension, the 14,000 square foot Louis Armstrong Center, blends in a little less. It looks, in fact, a bit like a 1960s spaceship landed in the middle of a residential block. By design, it doesn't tower over its neighboring vinyl-sided houses but, with its curvilinear roof, it does seem to want to envelop them. And behind its rippling brass facade lie some ambitious goals: to connect Armstrong as a cultural figure to fans, artists, historians and his beloved Queens community; to extend his civic and creative values to generations that don't know how much his vision, and his very being, changed things. It wants, above all, to invite more people in.
"The house is relatively small," said Regina Bain, executive director of the House Museum and Center, speaking of the two-story dwelling where Armstrong lived with his wife, Lucille, from 1943 until his death in 1971. "But his legacy is humongous. And this is the building that will help us to launch that."
The Center, 25 years in development, includes exhibition, research and education areas, and, for events, a 75-seat performance space whose blond wood and intimacy recall Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, the Jazz at Lincoln Center venue.
"I think that this will do something that we haven't quite seen in a jazz space," said Jason Moran, the jazz pianist and composer, who was the Center's inaugural exhibition curator. "That's also something that my community needs to witness, too. It needs to watch, how can we take care of an artist's history? And what else can it unleash in a community that might not even care about the art, but might care about something else related to it? Armstrong gives us all those opportunities to do that."
For the architects, Sara Caples and Everardo Jefferson, the project was a puzzle in how to link two structures -- the Center is across the street from the Armstrong House Museum -- with the spirit of a musical legend. Their inspiration came by going back to the music, and to Armstrong's street-level roots. "That kind of neighborhood that jazz actually emerged from -- that wasn't an elite creation, it was a popular creation," Caples said. "And yet it was the music that revolutionized how we think, how we listen, how we think about nonmusical things, even." They rounded the front of the Center to nod to the Armstrong house; its brass curtain echoes the color of his horn, and -- the musically fluent may notice -- the staggered hoop-shapes and columns in the entryway map out the notes of his most celebrated songs, like "What a Wonderful World" and "Dinah."
They also wanted to give their blueprint the sense of joy that Armstrong brings, the smile that you can feel in his singing voice. When they started the project, Jefferson called an uncle who's a jazz saxophonist to ask -- really, what made Armstrong so special? "And he said, you know, when you hear his music, you feel like dancing down the street," Jefferson said.
At the ribbon-cutting ceremony earlier this summer, trumpeters performed on the Armstrong house balcony and, across the road, on the upper deck of the Center, a fanfare that started with the opening bars of "West End Blues" and ended with "What a Wonderful World." "It was an incredible moment -- the building participated as a reflector of sound back to the street," Caples said. Afterward, schoolchildren were invited in to plonk around on a Steinway.
Built on the site of a former parking lot, with $ 26 million in mostly state and local funding, the new Center encompasses Armstrong's 60,000-piece archive, including 700 tapes that were once housed miles away at Queens College. From that collection, Moran has curated the first permanent exhibition, "Here to Stay," with a multimedia, interactive centerpiece of audio, video, interviews and songs. There's Armstrong's gold-plated trumpet -- a gift from King George V -- complete with his favorite imported German lip balm and the mouthpiece inscribed "Satchmo," his nickname -- and his collage art. (He made hundreds of pieces, paper cutouts on tape cases.) His first and last passports, among the ephemera, show his evolution from New Orleans-born youth player to a global icon in a tuxedo and an irrepressible grin.
Armstrong was himself a documentarian, traveling with cameras and recording equipment and turning the mic on himself, his friends and loved ones in private moments -- telling jokes backstage, opining at home. As a Black artist with an elementary school education, who was born into segregation, he went on to hobnob with presidents and royalty and to meet the pope. "He really marks a way of being a public figure," Moran said. "And he has to weigh how he does that. If he's getting a chance not only to tell his story with his trumpet in his mouth but through these microphones, then what are the stories he wants to tell, not in public? Those become important."
One place his vision is most evident is in his reel-to-reel tape box collages, rarely displayed publicly until now. Armstrong used them as an outlet for years.
"If he has a press clipping, maybe it wasn't favorable, he could cut it up and make a collage," Moran said. A photo in the exhibition shows him, after a trip to Italy, pasting his art work on the ceiling of his den, fresco-style. (Lucille Armstrong, a former Cotton Club dancer who was his fourth wife, put a stop to that.)
Moran recalled that when Armstrong talked about his process and why he liked making collages, he explained that with just the push-pull of material on a small canvas, you can change "the story that you were given." It echoed his expertise as a musician, Moran said, learning how to play background, on the cornet, with King Oliver, his early mentor, or foreground as he redefined what it meant to be a soloist, upending his destiny along the way.
The exhibition also has the artist Lorna Simpson in a video reflecting on Armstrong's collages and how they compartmentalized an enormous and complex life into the manageable and portable square of a tape case. "Armstrong archives and recontextualizes his public life by hand, to be layered and collaged onto the walls of his private life," she said.
The gallery display (by C & G Partners) is full of circular motifs, reminiscent of musical notes or records. In determining the palette for the Center, Jefferson and Caples, the architects, looked at Armstrong's art and his wardrobe; his home, with rooms in shades of electric blue or creamy peach, was mostly styled by Lucille. But he loved it -- especially the spaces with gilded or reflective surfaces. "So it gave us the cue that we should not be too mousy," Caples said, "and that this was a public building where there could be some expansiveness." The club space at the Center, which recently hosted a rehearsal of trumpeters for the Newport Jazz Festival's Armstrong tribute -- taking place this weekend in Rhode Island -- is a vibrant red.
Moran made sure there was a book from the Armstrongs' vast collection in every vitrine. "They had that kind of political library that was investigating their role in society," he said. (They also were creatures of their era: The full archives include Playboy anthologies and vintage diet recipes; a guide called "Lose Weight the Satchmo Way" -- heavy on the lamb chops -- is displayed in the exhibition.)
Even a longtime Armstrong devotee like Marquis Hill, one of the Newport trumpeters, was moved by these personal mementos. (He snapped a picture of the handwritten recipe for Armstrong's favorite dish, red beans and rice.) A half-century-old recording of Armstrong discussing how important it was to listen to all kinds of music inspired a Hill composition for Newport, commissioned by the Center. Its jazz club, he said, is "going to be a new space for what Louis Armstrong wanted, to keep pushing the music forward."
As part of an artist in residence program this fall, the Grammy winning bassist and singer Esperanza Spalding will present her project with the choreographer Antonio Brown that explores the era when people danced to jazz. Rooting herself in Armstrong's history, and expanding his vision, Spalding said in an email, would "develop ways to re-merge and re-awaken the dialogue between these essential modalities of human expression -- the improvising body and the improvising musician."
Under Bain, the executive director,the Center is also hosting new programming, including dance and yoga classes, trumpet lessons and events that engage the mostly Spanish-speaking community, whether through music or social activism.
"Louis and Lucille were two Black artists who owned their own home in the '40s," Bain said. "Why can't we have a workshop here about homeownership for our neighbors? If it's in the legacy of Louis and Lucille -- that's what this space can also be."
Since it opened on July 6, the Center has exceeded visitor estimates and is adding more hours and drawing fans from across the country. "He was one of the heroes I was taught about," said Jenne Dumay, 32, a social worker from Atlanta who plans music-oriented trips with friends, focusing on Black history. "This museum gives me insight that I didn't learn in my textbooks."
Among the final work Armstrong created, after a lengthy hospital stay in 1971, was a six-page handwritten ode to Corona, and his happy, quotidian life there. In looping script, he extols the virtues of his Schnauzers as watch dogs ("When the two start barking together -- oh boy, what a duet"), and his favoriteChinese restaurant.
It is one of the treasures that Moran -- who said Armstrong's spirit-lifting music helped him through the pandemic -- cherishes most. Armstrong's handwriting, he noted, slants upward on every page. "The text is just so inherently aspirational," Moran said. "It's in line with how he holds his trumpet" -- pointing up to the sky -- "how his eyes look when he plays. It's a slight thing, but it tells us: this is how he thinks about life."

NEW YORK — You can find anything in Queens. And yet for decades, the Louis Armstrong House Museum has been a well-kept secret on a quiet street in the Corona neighborhood. The longtime residence of the famed jazz trumpeter, singer and bandleader, it is a midcentury interior design treasure hidden behind a modest brick exterior.
The museum’s new extension, the 14,000 square foot Louis Armstrong Center, blends in a little less. It looks, in fact, a bit like a 1960s spaceship landed in the middle of a residential block. By design, it doesn’t tower over its neighboring vinyl-sided houses but, with its curvilinear roof, it does seem to want to envelop them. And behind its rippling brass facade lie some ambitious goals: to connect Armstrong as a cultural figure to fans, artists, historians and his beloved Queens community; to extend his civic and creative values to generations that don’t know how much his vision, and his very being, changed things. It wants, above all, to invite more people in.
“The house is relatively small,” said Regina Bain, executive director of both the museum and the center, speaking of the two-story dwelling where Armstrong lived with his wife, Lucille, from 1943 until his death in 1971. “But his legacy is humongous. And this is the building that will help us to launch that.”
The center, 25 years in development, includes exhibition, research and education areas, and, for events, a 75-seat performance space whose blond wood and intimacy recall Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, the Jazz at Lincoln Center venue.
“I think that this will do something that we haven’t quite seen in a jazz space,” said Jason Moran, the jazz pianist and composer, who was the center’s inaugural exhibition curator. “That’s also something that my community needs to witness, too. It needs to watch, how can we take care of an artist’s history? And what else can it unleash in a community that might not even care about the art, but might care about something else related to it? Armstrong gives us all those opportunities to do that.”
For architects Sara Caples and Everardo Jefferson, the project was a puzzle in how to link two structures — the center is across the street from the Armstrong House Museum — with the spirit of a musical legend. Their inspiration came by going back to the music, and to Armstrong’s street-level roots.
“That kind of neighborhood that jazz actually emerged from — that wasn’t an elite creation, it was a popular creation,” Caples said. “And yet it was the music that revolutionized how we think, how we listen, how we think about nonmusical things, even.”
The architects rounded the front of the center to nod to the Armstrong house; its brass curtain echoes the color of his horn, and — the musically fluent may notice — the staggered hoop-shapes and columns in the entryway map out the notes of his most celebrated songs, like “What a Wonderful World” and “Dinah.”
They also wanted to give their blueprint the sense of joy that Armstrong brings, the smile that you can feel in his singing voice. When they started the project, Jefferson called an uncle who’s a jazz saxophonist to ask — really, what made Armstrong so special?
“And he said, you know, when you hear his music, you feel like dancing down the street,” Jefferson said.
At the ribbon-cutting ceremony earlier this summer, trumpeters performed on the Armstrong house balcony and, across the road, on the upper deck of the center, a fanfare that started with the opening bars of “West End Blues” and ended with “It’s a Wonderful World.”
“It was an incredible moment — the building participated as a reflector of sound back to the street,” Caples said. Afterward, schoolchildren were invited in to plonk around on a Steinway.
Built on the site of a former parking lot, with $26 million in mostly state and local funding, the new center encompasses Armstrong’s 60,000-piece archive, including 700 tapes that were once housed miles away at Queens College. From that collection, Moran has curated the first permanent exhibition, “Here to Stay,” with a multimedia, interactive centerpiece of audio, video, interviews and songs.
There’s Armstrong’s gold-plated trumpet — a gift from King George V — complete with his favorite imported German lip balm and the mouthpiece inscribed “Satchmo,” his nickname — and his collage art. (He made hundreds of pieces, paper cutouts on tape cases.) His first and last passports, among the ephemera, show his evolution from New Orleans-born youth player to a global icon in a tuxedo with an irrepressible grin.
Armstrong was himself a documentarian, traveling with cameras and recording equipment and turning the mic on himself, his friends and loved ones in private moments — telling jokes backstage, opining at home. As a Black artist with an elementary school education, who was born into segregation, he went on to hobnob with presidents and royalty and to meet the pope.
“He really marks a way of being a public figure,” Moran said. “And he has to weigh how he does that. If he’s getting a chance not only to tell his story with his trumpet in his mouth but through these microphones, then what are the stories he wants to tell, not in public? Those become important.”
One place his vision is most evident is in his reel-to-reel tape box collages, rarely displayed publicly until now. Armstrong used them as an outlet for years.
“If he has a press clipping, maybe it wasn’t favorable, he could cut it up and make a collage,” Moran said. A photo in the exhibition shows him, after a trip to Italy, pasting his artwork on the ceiling of his den, fresco-style. (Lucille Armstrong, a former Cotton Club dancer who was his fourth wife, put a stop to that.)
Moran recalled that when Armstrong talked about his process and why he liked making collages, he explained that with just the push-pull of material on a small canvas, you can change “the story that you were given.” It echoed his expertise as a musician, Moran said, learning how to play background, on the cornet, with King Oliver, his early mentor, or foreground as he redefined what it meant to be a soloist, upending his destiny along the way.
The exhibition also has artist Lorna Simpson in a video reflecting on Armstrong’s collages and how they compartmentalized an enormous and complex life into the manageable and portable square of a tape case. “Armstrong archives and recontextualizes his public life by hand, to be layered and collaged onto the walls of his private life,” she said.
The gallery display (by C & G Partners) is full of circular motifs, reminiscent of musical notes or records. In determining the palette for the center, Jefferson and Caples looked at Armstrong’s art and his wardrobe; his home, with rooms in shades of electric blue or creamy peach, was mostly styled by Lucille. But he loved it — especially the spaces with gilded or reflective surfaces.
“So it gave us the cue that we should not be too mousy,” Caples said, “and that this was a public building where there could be some expansiveness.” The club space at the center, which recently hosted a rehearsal of trumpeters for the Newport Jazz Festival’s Armstrong tribute — taking place this weekend in Rhode Island — is a vibrant red.
Moran made sure there was a book from the Armstrongs’ vast collection in every vitrine. “They had that kind of political library that was investigating their role in society,” he said. (They also were creatures of their era: The full archives include Playboy anthologies and vintage diet recipes; a guide called “Lose Weight the Satchmo Way” — heavy on the lamb chops — is displayed in the exhibition.)
Even a longtime Armstrong devotee like Marquis Hill, one of the Newport trumpeters, was moved by these personal mementos. (He snapped a picture of the handwritten recipe for Armstrong’s favorite dish, red beans and rice.) A half-century-old recording of Armstrong discussing how important it was to listen to all kinds of music inspired a Hill composition for Newport, commissioned by the center. Its jazz club, he said, is “going to be a new space for what Louis Armstrong wanted, to keep pushing the music forward.”
As part of an artist in residence program this fall, Grammy-winning bassist-singer Esperanza Spalding will present her project with choreographer Antonio Brown that explores the era when people danced to jazz. Rooting herself in Armstrong’s history, and expanding his vision, Spalding said in an email, would “develop ways to remerge and reawaken the dialogue between these essential modalities of human expression — the improvising body and the improvising musician.”
Under Bain, the executive director, the center is also hosting new programming, including dance and yoga classes, trumpet lessons and events that engage the mostly Spanish-speaking community, whether through music or social activism.
“Louis and Lucille were two Black artists who owned their own home in the ’40s,” Bain said. “Why can’t we have a workshop here about homeownership for our neighbors? If it’s in the legacy of Louis and Lucille — that’s what this space can also be.”

Full text: From the essential spirit substitutes and how to mix them to the most striking glasses, everything you need to serve festive zero-proof cocktails.
It's no secret that nonalcoholic cocktails are suddenly ubiquitous. Whereas until a few years ago, nondrinkers had to make do with cranberry-splashed club soda, now seemingly every noteworthy bar offers a Phony Negroni or a margarita-inspired mocktail. "There are so many people who are nonimbibing, for whatever reason, but who still want to be a part of the mood," says Stacey Swenson, who designed the menu at the Swan Room bar in downtown Manhattan, which serves drinks including the Champaxne Cocktail (nonalcoholic sparkling wine, orange blossom and bitters) and the Chinola Mule (a tequila alternative with lime, passion fruit and spiced soda). The biggest change: teetotalers aren't the only ones ordering them. "Nine out of 10 of our customers also drink alcohol," says Nicholas Bodkins, one of the founders of Boisson, a store specializing in zero-proof spirits. "This is more of an 'and' than an 'or."' He gives credit for this shift to distillers, who, refining early iterations that often tasted soapy or medicinal, have figured out how to effectively extract the flavors of botanicals without the use of ethanol. Today, the best bitter aperitifs (the term for nonalcoholic alternatives to spirits like Campari and Aperol) have all the complexity and layered flavors of their boozy counterparts. They're also easy to find -- Boisson, for example, has locations in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco and a forthcoming Miami store, in addition to an online shop -- which makes stocking a home bar with nonalcoholic options a breeze. Here, the best bottles and other ingredients to have on hand. -- Oliver Strand
The Essential Spirits
Figlia: With bitter orange and clove, this aperitif tastes like a more delicate Campari and is delicious mixed into a spritz or served over ice.
Wilfred's: Akin to Aperol, it has sweet orange and gentian notes and is excellent in a traditional spritz or with tonic.
Ghia Signature Aperitif: Tart citrus, ginger and rosemary notes make it perfectly suited to a classic spritz.
Pathfinder: Bitter and complex like an amaro, it can be used as an aperitif or like a sweet vermouth.
Amass Riverine: With strong notes of juniper and coriander, it's marketed as more than just a gin alternative -- though it is perfect with tonic and lime on ice.
Three Spirit Social Elixir: Earthy and herbal, this pseudo-spirit lands somewhere between a bitter aperitif and an amaro.
Lyer's Agave Blanco: Its toasty agave base has just the slightest spicy kick. Mix it into a margarita-like drink or enjoy on the rocks with soda water and lime.
CleanCo W: This bourbon-style whiskey alternative has the oaky flavor of an aged spirit.
Caleño Dark and Spicy: Comparable to a spiced rum, it's excellent in a Cuba Libre with Coke and lots of fresh lime juice, or in a dark and stormy with ginger beer and a squeeze of lime.
Roots Divino Bianco: This complex, botanical take on vermouth comes in dry (with wormwood and rosemary) and sweet (orange peel and gentian root) varieties.
All the Bitter Aromatic Bitters: Comparable in taste to Angostura, it's spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg and clove and might, according to its maker, aid digestion.
French Bloom: A bubbly white wine made from chardonnay grapes, it can be used in place of Prosecco or Champagne.
The Best Mixers
Chinnoto: An Italian soda made with bitter citrus, it's also excellent on ice with sweet vermouth or a bitter aperitif. Or try it as an alternative to cola in rum or whiskey drinks.
Ginger Beer: Barritt's is the standard for a dark and stormy. For a less sweet version, consider Premium Ginger Beer from Fever-Tree or Maine Root Ginger Beer.
Soda Water: Schweppes and Canada Dry might be the benchmarks for soda water, but also consider Topo Chico, which has a mineral-rich tang.
Tonic: Fever Tree Indian Tonic Water, made from the quinine-rich bark of Congolese cinchona trees, is beloved for its just-bitter-enough flavor and refined fizz.
The Most Versatile Garnishes
Citrus: Lemons and limes are essential to any bar setup, and sliced orange is the standard spritz garnish. With its balance of bitter and sweet, pink grapefruit is a natural companion to aperitifs.
Olives: Bright-tasting Cerignola or Castelvetrano varieties are another excellent spritz add-on -- and also good for a snack.
Fresh Herbs: A sprig of thyme, rosemary or tarragon adds another layer of aromatic flavor to a mocktail.
How to Make a Simple Nonalcoholic Spritz
When making mocktails, most zero-proof spirits can be used as 1:1 substitutes for the buzz-inducing classics that inspired them. One particularly delicious option: the nonalcoholic spritz. Light, dry and refreshing it's also so adaptable that you can spend an entire summer perfecting your own signature variation. Below, a basic formula.
Mixing an Italian spritz is as easy as 3-2-1: Three parts Prosecco alternative (for example, French Bloom) and two parts bitter aperitif (try Figlia, Three Spirit Social, Wilfred's, Pathfinder or Ghia Signature Apertif) with one part soda water. An orange slice is a traditional garnish, but muddling two or three citrus sections -- lemon or pink grapefruit are also delicious -- in the bottom of the glass results in an even brighter flavor. Another variation on the spritz uses tonic water instead of Prosecco: Mix two parts tonic with two parts bitter aperitif and one part soda water. -- O.S.
What to Serve It In
Even the simplest cocktail can feel like the start of a party when it's served in a beautiful glass. If you're looking to upgrade yours, a good place to start would be these recycled-glass tumblers ( $ 132 for a set of six) handblown in Oaxaca, Mexico; they're charmingly wonky, with a rippled texture that suggests the wavy glass of antique windows, and sturdy, too. A more colorful alternative are the Italian fashion brand Sunnei's Murano cocktail glasses ( $ 96), which come in bold shades that mirror the signature stripes found on its clothing. Similarly distinctive are the Los Angeles-based artisan Cedric Mitchell's cocktail tumblers ( $ 180 for a set of two), which are designed to gently roll around when placed on a table, aerating and releasing the aromas of your drink. Unusual stemmed options include the satisfyingly chunky recycled-glass Oli wine goblets ( $ 29) from the Danish housewares brand Ferm Living and the Italian designer Joe Colombo's classic offset-stem wineglass for Arnolfo di Cambio ( $ 295 for a set of two). The idea behind the latter vessel, first introduced in 1964: to allow partygoers to grip it securely with their thumb while holding their cigarette.
For storing and serving drinks, the long-necked Estelle decanters ( $ 195) from the South Carolina-based company Estelle Colored Glass come in eight jewel-like hues, including pale sapphire and rose quartz. (Note that some zero-proof spirits require refrigeration, so check the label before leaving them out.) The angular Carafe N.2 ( $ 400) from the storied Italian silversmith Bragagnolo Argenti -- made from silver-plated hammered copper -- looks like a piece of Modernist art. And the borosilicate Fritter glass pitcher ( $ 150) by the French American designer Sophie Lou Jacobsen and the New York-based glass blower Grace Whiteside comes with a colorful stirring stick allowing it to double as a mixer. For finishing touches, you might consider a set of leaf-embroidered Italian linen cocktail napkins from the British designer Angela Wickstead ( $ 235 for a set of 6) or a few of the New York-based designer Misha Kahn's loopy little glass cocktail straws ( $ 30 each). -- Monica Khemsurov

Crafting with T; The Art of the Party Hat: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Seven makers from across the creative fields propose fantastical celebratory headwear.
In the United States, party hats -- those ubiquitous, cone-shaped signifiers of children's birthdays and summer picnics -- have their roots in a less celebratory phenomenon: the pointed dunce caps used as disciplinary tools in schools throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. It's a reminder that even the most unassuming objects can have complex meanings -- something that artists, several of whom have turned to party attire for inspiration, have long known.
The students of the Bauhaus, the influential German design academy founded in 1919, took their costume parties as seriously as their studies, dressing up as monstrous creatures and mechanical humanoids. And in 1972, the Spanish painter Salvador Dalí designed several fantastical ensembles for the infamous Surrealist Ball, a lavish gathering held at the French estate of the baroness Marie-Hélène de Rothschild. Celebrities and politicians arrived wearing towering headpieces to dine atop body-shaped mannequins splayed across tables; the actress Audrey Hepburn peered out from a rattan bird cage, complete with stray feathers, that sat on her shoulders.
In the spirit of this tradition, T invited makers working across the creative fields -- the multidisciplinary designer Faye Toogood; the ceramic artist Jolie Ngo; the fashion designer Piotrek Panszczyk of the brand Area; the multimedia artist Rakeem Cunningham; the costume designer Alexia Hentsch; and the designer Adam Charlap Hyman and the architect Andre Herrero of the firm Charlap Hyman & Herrero -- to propose their versions of a party hat. The only criterion was that each hat be made of materials typically available at a craft store so that, by following the artists' instructions, shared in the PDF below, the hat could be recreated at home. From there, imaginations ran free, yielding headdresses that resemble, among other things, a rainbow-colored palm tree, a coral reef and an otherworldly drinking helmet.
Alexia Hentsch
In January, while attending a wedding in Recife, a coastal city in northeast Brazil, the costume designer Alexia Hentsch came upon a group of dancers rehearsing for a carnival procession. Having closed her understated men's wear line Hentsch Man in 2015 to pursue more maximalist endeavors, such as designing the costumes for the opening ceremony of the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Hentsch was struck by the elaborate outfits worn by the performers. There were hand-embroidered ponchos and egg-shaped headpieces dripping with shimmering tinsel. For this project, Hentsch fashioned her take on the latter by gluing strips of stretched crepe paper onto an oversize straw sun hat, adding brightly colored layers until its surface resembled shaggy raffia palm leaves. "The materials were simple, but the work was like couture," says Hentsch, 41, of the ensembles she saw. "I'm fascinated by that high-low culture, and I think we have that all over Brazil, especially during Carnival."
Rakeem Cunningham
The artist Rakeem Cunningham's tender self-portraits, photographed within fabric-draped sets he builds in his Los Angeles studio, celebrate every aspect of himself, including his Blackness and his queerness. One other such trait he's learned to appreciate and reframe is the fact that he enjoys smoking weed, which is why Cunningham's party hat, a deconstructed baseball cap that he's covered with white polyester fiber fill, looks, in part, like a fluffy haze of smoke. "It just made me think of being on cloud nine, being elevated and just really enjoying life," says Cunningham, 31, who has a solo exhibition on view at Schlomer Haus Gallery in San Francisco. The hat, he says, "is definitely something meant to be worn by Black people." Central to his practice, he continues, "is the relationship between Black people and bodies and fantasy. I think it's important for us as Black people to be able to exist in our own fantasy worlds, costumes and stories and -- without guilt -- take up space in fantasy settings that weren't welcome to us." The addition of red and black Afro picks, tied in place with wire, is a nod to Cunningham's father, who died when the artist was 4 years old, and who gave him a similar comb, a memory that he still cherishes.
Adam Charlap Hyman and Andre Herrero
Grottos, popular in 18th-century Britain as decorative follies in gardens and parks, have found contemporary fans in Adam Charlap Hyman, 32, and Andre Herrero, 33, the designer-architect duo behind the New York- and Los Angeles-based design firm Charlap Hyman & Herrero. They have often recontextualized this motif with humor and whimsy, once creating a sculpture by adorning defunct telephones and keyboards found in the basement of the New York nonprofit space the Storefront for Art and Architecture with barnacles and starfish. Their "grotto hat," as Charlap Hyman calls it, is composed of a straw boater hat decorated with an array of preserved undersea life: shells, sponges, coral and pearls. "We love to work in the format of a homage," says Charlap Hyman, who referenced the 20th-century British Surrealist Eileen Agar's wearable sculpture "The Ceremonial Hat for Eating Bouillabaisse" (1936), a cork basket painted blue and topped with lobster tails and fish skeletons.
Faye Toogood
A towering headpiece in three stackable segments, Faye Toogood's party hat bridges two of the designer's latest projects, which she releases through her namesake fashion, design and interiors brand. It takes its cagelike shape from lobster traps, a nod to Toogood's maritime-inspired spring 2023 collection, which included voluminous sea-foam green trousers and striped watercolor prints. And its hues, particularly the dark red of its ribbon, tease Toogood's forthcoming clothing collection, which pulls its palette from the paintings of the American artist Philip Guston, whose work will feature in a major exhibition at London's Tate Modern in October. "I've just gone through a few months being really inspired by his attitude to his work," says Toogood, 46. "He had the courage to carve his own path and make his own way." As with many of Toogood's creations, the hat is at once sculptural and utilitarian, able to be collapsed and transported like a paper lantern.
Jolie Ngo
A longtime player of life-simulating video games like The Sims and Animal Crossing, the artist Jolie Ngo, 27, says she was conditioned to become "a world builder in a digital space" from a young age. She designs her vibrant pastel-gradient vessels and wonkily shaped sculptures on a computer using 3-D-modeling technology, which she views as another environment where "you're able to create and be free," then prints them with a machine loaded with colored clay or porcelain. Every year, in late January or early February, Ngo celebrates the Vietnamese holiday Tết by decorating paper crowns with her family in Philadelphia, which is why her party hat takes the form of a whimsical tiara. The primary material -- plastic straws, which Ngo bent into place after applying heat with a hair dryer -- is a more unexpected tribute to novelty drinking helmets. "Play is really evident in my practice," she says, "and I think those hats are kind of goofy. There's a really playful element to them."
Piotrek Panszczyk
Butterfly shapes have become a hallmark of the New York brand Area since its establishment in 2014 -- as audacious crystal-encrusted halter tops or cutout detailing on jeans and tees -- so much so that the label's designer, Piotrek Panszczyk, 37, dedicated the entirety of his latest collection to the insect. "It's a bittersweet motif [because] I hate butterflies," says Panszczyk. "Even when I was growing up, there was some type of beauty to them, but there was also something gross. Because of that, I like revisiting and reframing it in different ways." A graphic black-and-white butterfly, its exaggerated wings obscuring the model's eyes, was fixed to a felt wool cap and styled backward for the brand's pre-fall 2023 look book. Inspired by how fans have recreated items from Area's previous collections, the designer opted to reimagine this showpiece using an accessible material, card stock paper, with a simple band construction. "It's really about evoking something and including people in your world," Panszczyk says.

It's Not Too Late to Buy a Great One-Piece Swimsuit: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It's sale season for swimwear, a great time to upgrade your basic old go-to.
August might seem a little late to shop for swimsuits, but it's also the time of year when many of us may finally be on vacation -- and, hopefully, in or near a body of water.
If you've waited 'til now to replace your old swimsuit, fear not. There are lots of options still available and many are on sale! Of the various styles to choose from, few can get more mileage than a simple black one-piece, a classic that people should have in their arsenal.
One reason black one-pieces are considered a staple is because you can find them at countless retailers like the Gap. There's nothing wrong with one-piece swimsuits from these chains; they typically are inexpensive and fit pretty well. But rarely does buying them make you feel anything other than relieved that you don't have to shop for more.
For those who want something that's bolder, below are seven options that are better than a basic black one-piece -- including a polished halter-top style that might surprise people when they find out it is from the Gap.
J.Kim: Chilla Petal One-Piece
The designer Jenia Kim is known for using petal cutouts in pieces for her line J.Kim. The brand's first collection of swimwear includes a black one-piece that features the signature cutouts. And to those wondering: Yes, the cutouts' positioning takes unwanted "slips" into account, according to the brand.
Lido: Trentanove Rib
Lido is a brand sold at coastal Italian hotels and cult boutiques across the world, including La Garçonne, in TriBeCa, and Voo Store, in Berlin. Its timeless, minimal swimsuits are rendered in sophisticated solids as well as in dreamy gradients and can be worn beyond the beach or the pool. This Trentanove one-piece is designed to mimic the look of a rib-knit tank, meaning it can also be worn as a body suit.
Jean Paul Gaultier: Multicolor 'The Scarf' Swimsuit
If you love prints, look to brands that have been deftly using them for decades -- Pucci and Marimekko are great bets, as is Jean Paul Gaultier, which made this swimsuit for its spring 2023 collection. The one-piece's abstract imagery refers to textile collages from Gaultier's spring 2001 show. Another patterned Gaultier option is "The Body Morphing" one-piece, which features a warped striped print first used by the brand in its spring 1996 collection.
Baserange: Vein Swim Body
Baserange has developed a cult following for its unisex basics. This canary-yellow one-piece cleverly employs contrasting brown seams to add visual intrigue -- a technique that fans of the brand might recognize.
Eres: Black Tapis Rouge Swimsuit
Eres, which is owned by Chanel, dominates the luxury swim space. Its swimsuits can cost up to $ 800 and are made with peau douce, a soft, clingy proprietary fabric that incorporates polyamide and spandex. (The fabric, according to the brand, is a reason for the high prices.) With a bateau neckline and an open back, the elegant, trend-defying Tapis one-piece is a silhouette worth splurging on, especially when it goes on sale, as is often the case this time of year.
Nu Swim: Straight One-Piece
Nu Swim has won the attention of minimalism-adoring customers in part because its swimwear is produced at a family-owned factory in Queens that handled J. Crew's swimwear in the '90s -- a golden era to those in the know.
Gap: Recycled Halter One-Piece Swimsuit
If you've considered the previous options and thought, "Actually, I'd rather just have a Gap one-piece," try this classic silhouette with a full-coverage bottom, a flattering fit and crisscross straps that look more interesting than the average neckline.

U.K. Alcohol Taxes Aim to Keep Pubs Open and Votes Flowing: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The changes are the biggest shake-up to Britain's alcohol levies in 140 years, according to a government whose leader was clearly on the campaign trail in announcing them.
When Britain's prime minister, Rishi Sunak, a teetotaler, dropped in on a west London beer festival on Tuesday, he was looking for votes rather than pints while promoting a government policy that he said would ease the financial squeeze on some of Britain's drinkers.
Yet not everyone is convinced by the new set of alcohol tax rates, which are expected to cut the cost of beer for pub-goers but which have angered many other Britons by raising the fees on most other alcoholic beverages.
As Mr. Sunak served a pint of beer at the festival, one bystander heckled him, crying out: "Prime minister! Oh, the irony that you're raising alcohol duty on the day that you're pulling a pint." Another thought Mr. Sunak needed reminding that the drink he was pouring was "not Coca-Cola," Sky News reported.
With high inflation rates eroding living standards in Britain, an election expected next year and Mr. Sunak's Conservative Party trailing badly in the polls, his government was trying hard to put its best spin on what the new rules would mean for the average voter.
That includes what the government is calling a "Brexit pub guarantee" -- a policy that it is touting as an example of the greater flexibility in setting tax rates that Britain gained by leaving the European Union.
"The duty for a pint in a pub will always be less than the duty for a pint in a supermarket," Jeremy Hunt, the country's finance minister, said in a video message filmed on a visit to a pub. "That is really to help pubs keep their heads above water, and we think that is a really positive thing."
Duties on alcohol had been frozen since 2020, partly to help Britain's pubs, which play a celebrated role in national life but which have been battered by the coronavirus pandemic, labor shortages and inflation. Thousands of them have closed in recent years.
Although higher taxes will now be levied on stronger drinks, the government says that about 38,000 pubs around the country will benefit from reduced taxes on alcoholic drinks poured on tap. It says that the duty that pubs pay on each such drink, including pints of beer and cider, will be up to 11 pence, or 14 cents, cheaper than in supermarkets.
It also described the shake-up as the biggest in the system in the last 140 years.
The changes, and other concessions for small producers, were welcomed by Barry Watts, the head of public affairs at the Society of Independent Brewers, a trade group. "Hopefully we will see more people because of this getting off their sofas returning to their bar stools to support their local community pub," he said.
Tax on sparkling wine, which had been higher than that levied on still wine, will decrease, leaving it around 19 pence a bottle cheaper if retailers pass on the reduction. Still wine could increase 44 pence a bottle, and spirits and fortified wines will be subject to even bigger price increases.
On Tuesday, Mr. Sunak defended the changes by saying that the government was bolstering the economy "by cutting taxes for small producers so they can expand and employ more people." He added that "most people would agree" that paying higher taxes for higher alcohol content is a "a common-sense principle."
That sentiment was endorsed by the Institute of Alcohol Studies, a body that focuses on the effects alcohol has on society. The group said that it supported the shift to a more proportionate tax system related to the strength of drinks, but it argued that the duty rates were still set too low.
Yet Miles Beale, the chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, an industry lobby group, noted that the sector faced other challenges, including constrained spending among much of the public, persistently high inflation and rocketing prices for glass.
"Amongst all this pressure, the government has chosen to impose more inflationary misery on consumers on 1 August, with the biggest single alcohol duty increase in almost 50 years," he said.
There was disappointment, too, in Scotland, where the Scotch Whisky Association also condemned the change.
"The 10.1 percent duty increase is a hammer blow for distillers and consumers," said Graeme Littlejohn, the association's director of strategy. "At a time when inflation has only just started to creep downwards, this tax increase will continue to fuel inflation and make it more difficult for the Scotch whisky industry to invest in growth and job creation."
For Mr. Sunak, though, any fallout will be political rather than personal, since his favorite drink -- Mexican Coke -- is nonalcoholic and will therefore be unaffected.

On Wall Street, Gloomy Feeling Is Tough to Sell: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The S&P 500 is up more than 19 percent this year, but some still warn that the future may not be as rosy as that implies.
Beaten as they might be by the stock market's rally, worriers on Wall Street still question how long it can last. Their numbers are shrinking, though.
After starting the year with dour warnings about the economy, many investors and analysts have changed their minds. This newfound bullishness is grounded in signs that inflation is slowing and the economy is still standing strong, as well as a belief that corporate profits are set to grow now that interest rates have reached their peak, or are at least very close to it.
The past week gave them little reason to revert to more gloomy opinions.
Marquee earnings from some large tech companies, like Meta and Alphabet, helped drive stock prices higher. Consumer-facing companies like Coca-Cola and Unilever that are dependent on households continuing to spend also posted bumper financial results. Even the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, said on Wednesday that the central bank's own researchers no longer expected a recession this year.
With that upbeat backdrop, the S&P 500 has climbed more than 19 percent since the start of the year. The benchmark sits less than 5 percent from the record it reached in January 2022.
In other words, it's been a difficult time to be bearish.
"We were wrong," Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley, one of the most pessimistic analysts on Wall Street at the start of the year, wrote in a note to clients this week.
But that doesn't mean Mr. Wilson thinks the future will be as rosy as many investors do. He is still predicting that the S&P 500 will end the year more than 15 percent below where it is today, and he is not alone.
"I think the market is under the view that the economy is now out of the woods because the Fed is done or almost done raising interest rates," said Eric Johnston, the head of equity derivatives at Cantor Fitzgerald. "Our view is that the risks to the economy over the coming quarters remain high."
Central to the bearish view is the Fed's swift and drastic increase of interest rates over the last 16 months, to a 22-year high. After another increase this week, the Fed's policy rate is in the range of 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent, up from zero at the start of last year.
Rate increases work with a lag, meaning the economy has yet to feel the full effect of the Fed's actions. That late effect could become a problem for companies bloated by cheap debt built up since the 2008 financial crisis. As higher borrowing costs make their way through this mountain of bonds and loans, they will increase costs for the companies involved, many of which are already struggling.
The Fed's forecasts from June point to interest rates easing to 4.6 percent by the end of 2024, but investors are betting they will drop even lower over the same period, to 4.2 percent. The Fed's forecasts have been wrong before, but so have the market's.
It's also possible that interest rates will remain higher than either expect, because inflation, while slowing, remains far from the Fed's goal of 2 percent. Mr. Powell reiterated this week that the central bank was committed to that target, achieved by slowing the economy through higher rates.
Higher stock prices have made the Fed's job harder, enriching investors and leaving companies and consumers with access to more money, fueling spending. That undercuts efforts to ease inflation.
These financial conditions are likely to need to change, either naturally as student loan payments restart in the fall and savings dwindle, forcing households to tighten their purse strings, or more forcefully, with the Fed raising rates even higher. Either would be bad for companies and stock prices.
Mr. Powell appeared to suggest as much this week, noting that financial conditions had become detached from the Fed's policy but that eventually the two would most likely come back together.
"Ultimately, over time we get where we need to go," Mr. Powell said. That could spell trouble for the stock market, some analysts said.
Brad Bernstein, a financial adviser at UBS Wealth Management, said he thought the market, at this point, was largely ignoring the Fed's forecasts. The Fed's "ability to predict six to 12 months from now is as good or bad as my kids predicting what the Fed will do in six to 12 months," he said.
Business executives, on the other hand, continue to show caution about the future, judging by a variety of confidence surveys tracked by investors.
"The question is, if the unemployment rate stays low and asset prices remain high, is it going to reignite inflation and will the Fed need to come back and do more?" Mr. Johnston said. "We just don't know, but I think that is a looming risk."
On Thursday, investors saw a glimpse of what could happen should rates rise further. Better-than-expected economic data, combined with a report that Japan's central bank may relax its policy of keeping its own government's bond yields low, sparked a rapid increase in benchmark borrowing costs around the world -- jolting traders across financial markets. The Bank of Japan then said on Friday that it would take steps to let bond yields edge higher.
Still, this blip did little to damage the market's ascent. On Friday, the S&P 500 rallied again -- climbing 1 percent and locking in its third consecutive weekly gain -- after a second inflation measure for June showed price increases slowing while consumer spending continued to rise.
The stock rally has broadened from the handful of mammoth tech companies that had an outsize impact on the market earlier this year to a set of businesses including smaller companies and those more susceptible to the ups and downs of the economy.
Roughly half the companies in the S&P 500 have reported earnings for the three months through June. So far, the index has reported slight earnings growth, bucking expectations of a 7 percent contraction -- although many of the companies expected to post a sharp decline have not yet reported.
"The economy is doing better than expected, and earnings are doing better than expected," Mr. Bernstein said. "Ultimately, that's all that matters."

A Singles Party Where Chaos Is the Point: [Style Desk]

Full text: The monthly event asks guests to bring someone they've matched with on Tinder, but whom they don't yet know. What could go wrong?
"Are any of you guys drinking Jack and Coke right now," Jesus Valdes shouted at two women who were sipping cocktails during a crowded singles mixer at American Whiskey, a bar in Midtown Manhattan. They were not, and Mr. Valdes let out a sigh of frustration.
He was playing Chaotic Bingo, a game in which guests were given a sheet that listed 25 characteristics they had to find in someone else, including someone who's had sex this month and someone you'd want to kiss later. First one to circle five across received one free year of Tinder platinum.
Mr. Valdes, 34, a professor from Staten Island, said that he had met a few people already that he was interested in, including one "stand out," but that it was early and he still wanted to mingle.
"I told her I got to keep my options open," he said. "She said, 'I understand."'
This was one of the many features of the Chaotic Singles Party, a monthly event where singles are invited to attend to meet other singles, but only if they bring one of their Tinder matches, whom they do not know, as their plus one.
With more than 300 tickets sold, the bar was already swelling with guests shortly after the party started at 9 p.m. on a Friday. Romantic hopefuls wearing white name tags on their chest were sipping drinks and almost screaming in conversation as pop music blared through the speakers and light from eight TVs mounted on the wall illuminated the space with baseball and basketball games.
Godfrey Butler, 26, an I.T. field technician who lives in the Bronx, arrived alone after discovering the event on Eventbrite two days before. " I was trying to be a brave soldier," he said, adding that dating has been a "rough patch."
"I haven't used dating apps this year, but maybe I should join," he added. "I think it's better to meet people in person."
Hosted by Cassidy Davis, the party grew out of her difficult time with dating in Los Angeles. On Valentine's Day in 2022, she instructed her single female friends to invite random men from their dating apps to her house for a party. At the last minute, she also invited 65 men off Tinder.
"Like six dudes, differently, were like, Is this an organ-harvesting scam?" she said. "And I was like, Who hurt you? Like no babe, not me. But the fun ones came and it was a really fun party."
She uploaded the party on TikTok and it quickly went viral. Using that momentum, she rented out a venue in Los Angeles and threw the same party two weeks later. Five hundred people showed up. After receiving a flurry of news coverage, she has been throwing the parties monthly ever since.
Now with a partnership with Tinder, she has taken her party on the road with a singles summer series to celebrate "uncuffing" season, hosting five parties in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago.
The parties offer relief from using dating apps -- solace that more people are seeking in a variety of ways. Instead of swiping, people are trying speed dating, posting personal ads around their neighborhoods, soliciting help from a matchmaker or taking a break from dating all together.
Tinder this year started its first global brand campaign to celebrate the "possibilities" offered by the app, which has become known as a forum for easy sex and hookups. The company has hosted real-life initiatives in the past, like matching singles with adoptable dogs to attract pet lovers or partnering with Lyft to gift your match a ride to your date, but this is the first time it has partnered with an in-person singles mixer.
Making their presence known at in-person singles events is one way Tinder is trying to get people out the door and on dates again, Sheldon Bachan, a spokesman for Tinder, said.
"We're always trying to bridge the gap between online and offline dating, so we thought this collaboration was cool and a great way to do that," Bachan said.
Back at the party, Davis kicked off a game called Musical Cheers. "It's like musical chairs, but with alcohol," she said. Guests moved around the room as music played, and when it stopped, they clinked glasses with the person in front of them, then answered a "chaotic question."
Two guests were standing near each other when the music stopped and Davis shared the first question: "Why did your last relationship end?"
"My last relationship ended because my ex thought she wanted to go back with her baby father," said one of the guests, Michael, who declined to share his last name for privacy reasons, but added that he was dumped just a week ago.
Michael said he understood it was odd that he was already at a singles mixer days later, but added that things had "felt off" for a while.
Jayel Gant and Donnaleah Jones came to the event together but were only meeting for the first time after they both had dates who canceled just hours before.
"I was swiping as I do and an ad for the party came up on Tinder. And so I put on my Tinder bio, if you buy tickets to this event, I'll give you a kiss," said Gant, who is pansexual. "And I decided to go with this one guy and then he canceled two hours before we were supposed to meet up."
Determined to go, Gant bought their own ticket. Since it came with a plus one, they went to the queer dating app Lex and asked if anyone wanted to attend the party. Jones, who also had a date cancel on her that night, said yes.
When asked whether they were feeling each other, Gant smiled and said, "TBD." Jones, who is also pansexual, said, "We'll see" with a smirk.

Full text: Mendel Goldberg, a Jewish immigrant from Poland, opened his shop in the late 1800s. Four generations later, it's a go-to destination for top costume designers.
Step behind the unassuming facade of Mendel Goldberg Fabrics on Manhattan's Lower East Side and you'll suddenly find yourself surrounded by an array of gorgeous fabrics on its floor-to-ceiling shelves: bolts and neatly folded stacks of fine cottons, silks, satins, taffetas and lace as well as more opulent materials, from bubble-gum pink metallic brocade to apple green silk satin jacquard and shimmery pleated navy chiffon. There are fabrics woven with gold thread or glittering with Swarovski crystals. And there is Chanel-style wool bouclé in pale pink, or black and white woven with little ribbons and pearls. The material is as luxuriously textured as a lamb's coat. I want it.
I don't sew. I haven't got the DNA (no one in my family did). I've never really paid attention to the world of bespoke clothing or the fabrics a designer might use, not until a few months ago, when I went to Hester Street -- a street once jammed with pushcarts and now crowded with delivery bikes -- and walked into Mendel Goldberg, where, feeling as if I'd wandered into a psychedelic dreamscape, I coveted everything.
Presiding over the shop from her usual perch, above a large wooden table where she measures out the fabric, was proprietor Alice Goldberg, wearing a fitted white blouse, a narrow beige skirt with a zipper up the back and black flats. Goldberg is the fourth generation of her family to run the store since her great-grandfather Mendel founded it. Alongside Luis Ortega, the Goldbergs' aide-de-camp since 1989, Alice has witnessed a few memorable shopping sprees, including the time a few years back when a group of Saudi princesses spent about 30 minutes in the store, "buying like crazy," and the day seven bridesmaids purchased beaded sky blue tulle for their dresses.
Costume designers are also frequent customers. Among them is John Glaser, who oversaw the wardrobe for season one of Netflix's "Bridgerton" (along with Ellen Mirojnick) as well as that for the upcoming season three. "You can get things here you can't get anywhere else, like certain very rich and expensive over-embroidered or beaded material," Glaser says. He's used Mendel Goldberg's fabrics for a number of the costumes for the Regency-era period drama, including a sheer white frock in laser cut silk chiffon, a fabric that "we used inside out," Glaser adds. "There was also a dress for Lady Bridgerton made of pale blue silk jacquard that reminded me of an 18th-century wallpaper."
While I'm in the shop, I watch as Goldberg drapes ivory gazar against a bride-to-be, showing her how it would work as an engagement party dress. Later that afternoon, Tsigie White, the costume designer for the TV series "Power Book III: Raising Kanan," stops in. She's mesmerized by a piece of gold material covered with glittering paillettes. "I'll find something to do with it for the show," she says while Goldberg measures a yard of it for her. "I've never been here before; a friend mentioned it," she continues. "This is a great find for me."
Goldberg knows her stock by heart, and even the stores's website -- seemingly the business's largest concession to the 21st century -- is wonderfully detailed, the fabrics carefully described and shown draped on mannequins. Goldberg's customers are based all over the country, as well as abroad; some of them ask to browse the fabrics over Zoom or FaceTime. "I want everyone to buy on the internet with the same confidence as if they walked in the store. Let's say you're in Texas and you order something online. I don't want you to open [the package] and say, 'Oh my God,' " she says. "I want you to be thrilled."
It's a long way from the days when Mendel Goldberg, a Jewish immigrant from Poland, sold tailoring supplies off a pushcart on the Lower East Side. In 1890, he opened the shop in this five-floor building. (The basement is now the stockroom; apartments occupy the upper four stories.) His son Alexander sold silk to furriers for coat linings; Alexander's son Samuel -- Alice's father -- sold fabric to Gimbels and Macy's, both of which had large departments for home dressmaking.
The business prospered. Alice was born in Brooklyn and spent her later childhood years in Great Neck, N.Y., where her parents lived and commuted to Hester Street. "I was a very sheltered girl," she says. "All my clothes were made for me by my grandma Ida, Alexander's wife."
After college, Alice taught math, married and moved to Manhattan's Upper East Side, where she still lives. She has two daughters, Alexandra, who lives in Jerusalem, and Josefa, who lives in New Rochelle, N.Y. Josefa's daughter Eliana did her recent high-school senior thesis on fashion. If she eventually takes over Mendel Goldberg Fabrics, Eliana will be the sixth generation to manage the business.
Alice Goldberg didn't join the family business until she was in her 30s. Her father came to her home and said, "'Your mother is sick, you have to come into the store.' I walked in and never left," she says.
Her first assignment was a fabric buying trip to Europe. "At some of the great Swiss companies, I saw the most beautiful goods. They asked about my credit because they didn't know me," she says, smiling. "I say, 'Can you do me a favor? Please send someone to tell my driver I'll be here for some time.' I figured if they saw I had a Mercedes with a chauffeur it would be all right." She got the credit, and now travels to Italy, Switzerland and France twice a year.
It isn't just the sumptuous fabrics that make Mendel Goldberg so sought out by connoisseurs, however, but Alice Goldberg herself. "I've never had a return," she says. "Never. How crazy is that?" I'm thinking about a winter coat. As if she's read my mind, she shows me navy blue French wool bouclé and suggests we line it in printed cashmere. As my mother always said, "Why have economy in fantasy?"

Major Brands Keep Raising Prices, Complicating Fed's Inflation Fight: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Unilever have each reported raising prices significantly in the second quarter, complicating the Federal Reserve's efforts to tame inflation.
Some of the largest consumer brands in the country have continued to raise prices aggressively this year while raking in large profits, posing a tough problem for the Federal Reserve as it aims to tame inflation.
Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Unilever have each reported raising prices significantly in the second quarter, from about 8 percent at Unilever to 15 percent at Pepsi. The price increases powered sales growth last quarter, keeping earnings strong even as the volume of products they sold either went down or remained flat versus the same period last year. The companies raised their full-year forecasts for various measures, pushing up their share prices.
The Fed's main tool to tackle inflation is raising interest rates, which reduces demand for goods and services. But food prices can be particularly sticky: Unlike other goods, food is something that consumers cannot stop buying, and food prices are particularly sensitive to external factors like supply shocks, ingredient prices and geopolitics. Escalating Russian attacks in Ukraine and the recent breakdown of a deal to export grain from Black Sea ports have put pressure on prices for key commodities like corn and wheat.
"The Fed really has no ability to resolve those issues," said David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University.
Prices for consumer goods in the United States have moderated, though inflation is still higher than the Federal Reserve's goal. Food prices rose 5.7 percent over the year through June, according to the Consumer Price Index.
Coca-Cola said on Wednesday that its profit last quarter rose 33 percent from a year earlier, to $ 2.5 billion. "In a world with a wide spectrum of market dynamics from inflation to currency devaluation to shifting consumer needs, our business is proving to be very resilient," James Quincey, Coca-Cola's chief executive, told analysts on a call.
Unilever, which makes products like Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise, on Tuesday reported 20 percent growth in profit, to $ 5 billion, in the first half of the year, compared with the same period last year.
Unilever's ice cream brands, which include Ben & Jerry's and Magnum, have become particularly more expensive: Prices were up more than 12 percent while the amount sold was down about 6 percent in the second quarter.
PepsiCo, which makes Gatorade sports drinks, Lay's potato chips and Quaker Oats, reported this month that its second-quarter revenue grew 10 percent and that its profit doubled, to $ 2.7 billion, from a year earlier.
The companies have cited a strong labor market, in which wages are growing, as source of increased spending.
"We've been able to raise prices and consumers stay within our brands," Ramon Laguarta, chief executive of Pepsi, said on a call with analysts.
However, Unilever's chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, told analysts on Tuesday that "sentiment is dropping and consumers are starting to show signs of caution" with more consumers turning to generic brands.

Fed Lifts Rates And Has Door Open for More: [National Desk]

Full text: Federal Reserve officials lifted borrowing costs by a quarter-point after pausing in June. Rates could rise more, but the central bank is not ready to commit.
Federal Reserve officials raised interest rates to their highest level in 22 years and left the door open to further action as they continued their 16-month campaign to wrestle inflation lower by cooling the American economy.
Officials pushed rates to a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent, their highest level since 2001, in a unanimous decision.
Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, suggested in a news conference following the decision that while the "pieces of the puzzle" that could allow inflation to sustainably slow down are beginning to come together, rates had not yet been high enough for long enough -- and that the Fed was "prepared to further tighten" if necessary.
The Fed chief carefully kept the central bank's options open at an uncertain economic juncture, one that offers reasons for both optimism and caution.
Fed policymakers began to raise rates from near-zero in March 2022 and pushed them up rapidly last year before adjusting them more slowly in 2023, even taking a break last month. Because officials think rates are now high enough to weigh on the economy, they have been moving more gradually to give themselves time to see how growth, the job market and inflation are responding to the shift in policy.
Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index cooled in June to 3 percent from a peak of 9.1 percent, though it remains faster than that after stripping out food and fuel prices, which are volatile. The moderation has been welcome news at a time when the unemployment rate is hovering at 3.6 percent -- a historically low level, and essentially unchanged from when the Fed began to push rates higher more than a year ago.
But inflation has previously slowed and then picked back up, and the Fed is not yet ready to take a victory lap. Mr. Powell said officials would be watching incoming data ahead of the Fed's Sept. 20 meeting to decide whether they need to raise interest rates further at that gathering. He avoided explaining what precisely would prompt the Fed to either lift rates or hold them steady, noting that the Fed has eight weeks and a substantial amount of incoming data to review before it must decide.
"We've come a long way," Mr. Powell said at one point. "Inflation repeatedly has proved stronger than we and other forecasters have expected -- and at some point that may change. We have to be ready to follow the data and given how far we've come, we can afford to be a little patient as well as resolute as we let this unfold."
Higher interest rates cool the economy by making it more expensive to borrow money, discouraging business expansions and making it costlier to take out a mortgage or a car loan. But it takes time for them to trickle through the economy, so the full effects of the moves so far most likely have not been felt. Policymakers want to make sure that they temper demand enough to put an end to rapid price increases, but they would prefer to avoid plunging the economy into a recession if they can avoid it.
That is why investors and economists have begun to think that the Fed may hold off on additional rate increases. With inflation coming down, officials may feel confident holding policy steady and waiting to see if the trend will continue.
"The really clear message was: Things are data dependent," said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan, adding that he thought Mr. Powell's comments and manner seemed to lean optimistic. "It felt like he was biased to perhaps be a little bit patient here and see if this disinflation has some legs."
After fluctuating higher and lower as Mr. Powell spoke, stocks across all three major indexes -- the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow -- ended the day close to where they started. The S&P and Nasdaq posted modest losses. The Dow moved 0.2 percent higher to record its longest streak of daily gains since the 1980s.
Economists have recently become increasingly hopeful that the Fed might be able to slow inflation without causing an outright economic downturn, clinching what is often called a soft landing. In a nod to the economy's resilience, officials noted on Wednesday that it was expanding at a "moderate" pace, an upgrade from "modest" in their June statement.
And the Fed's influential staff economists -- who help policymakers assess the outlook -- no longer think America will fall into a recession late this year, Mr. Powell said. They previously had forecast a mild one.
But Fed officials may not feel confident that inflation will return to their 2 percent goal quickly or completely enough at a time when growth remains so robust.
If consumer spending continues to chug along, companies may still have the wherewithal to raise prices without losing customers: Firms including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Unilever, for instance, have all recently reported price increases. Although the slowdown in inflation so far is welcome news, it has been driven primarily not by their policy changes, but by a slow return to normal after years of pandemic-related disruptions across a range of products, from cars to couches.
"We think we need some further softening in labor market conditions," Mr. Powell said on Wednesday, noting that while that might hurt, high inflation would also harm the most vulnerable people in the economy.
That is why policymakers are keeping alive the possibility that they could continue raising interest rates.
The Fed projected in June that it would make two more rate increases this year -- the one it ushered in on Wednesday, and a follow-up at some point in the future. Mr. Powell made clear that such an increase remained entirely possible.
"We're looking for supply and demand through the economy coming into better balance, including in particular the labor market," Mr. Powell explained. "We'll be asking ourselves: Does this whole collection of data, do we assess it as suggesting that we need to raise rates further?"
At the same time, Mr. Powell and his fellow policymakers have little reason to signal clearly what comes next. No policy meeting is held in August, though Mr. Powell often speaks at a closely watched Fed conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., late in the month.
Fed officials will not release a fresh set of quarterly economic projections until their meeting on Sept. 20. And if they choose to skip raising rates at that meeting -- like they did in June -- that would make Nov. 1 the next meeting before policymakers must make a big rate decision.
Other Fed officials -- including Mary C. Daly, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco -- had previously said that they wanted to keep their options open for now. Christopher J. Waller, a Fed governor, suggested this month that he would favor moving rates up in September if inflation was looking hot, but could be open to holding off if price increases continued to cool.
"The September meeting is a 'live' meeting and it depends on the data," Mr. Waller said at an event in New York after the latest Consumer Price Index inflation report showed a notable slowdown. "We'll get two more C.P.I. reports. If they look like the last two, the data would suggest maybe stopping."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At the eight-minute mark of the final of the CAN 18 soccer tournament, the players on the Mauritania team score three times in rapid succession.
The balls hitting the goalkeeper's small net sound like the blasts of a cannon. Boom. Boom. Boom. The last two happen so quickly that many in the crowd miss them.
"Did they score?" the Ivory Coast fan squished next to me asks, looking stunned. "Yes, twice," a Mauritanian fan on my other side responds gleefully.
It doesn't take long to understand that the annual soccer tournament of Paris's 18th arrondissement is different: The stadium is a small, caged turf court in the middle of the Goutte d'Or -- the dense, working-class landing spot for each new wave of immigrants to the city, a place where African wax stores and tailors for boubous compete with boulangeries and bistros among the crowded streets.
The tournament was one of many around Paris inspired by the 2019 edition of the Africa Cup of Nations, or Coupe d'Afrique des nations in French, the continental competition typically held every two years. The events have become so popular that the finals of one in Créteil, a southeastern suburb of Paris, were broadcast on Amazon Prime last summer.
In the Goutte d'Or, Mamoudou Camara's principal aim wasn't to shine a positive light on immigration and community spirit in his neighborhood, which is tucked behind the Gare du Nord -- Europe's busiest train station -- and is among the city's most impoverished, gritty and diverse areas. He was just thinking a tournament might help his friends survive the hot nights during Ramadan. He raised the idea on Snapchat, and by the end of that evening in summer 2019, six teams had registered. A day later, there were six more.
Instead of holding the event in a far-off stadium, Camara and his friends decided to host it in their childhood nest, the mini court in the center of the urban park where they spent their summer nights and weekends, battling over a ball and rounds of Coca-Cola or Fanta. (The loser paid.)
It offers a very different atmosphere than the marble statues and the manicured flower beds of the Tuileries and Luxembourg gardens. On game nights, the park, Square Léon, is buzzing with older men crowded around checker tables, little kids clambering up playground equipment and older women in West African dresses selling bags of homemade doughnuts and slushy ginger drinks that both tickle and soothe the throat.
Just before the final match starts, a tambour player beats out rhythms.
"In our neighborhood, we have all nationalities," said Camara, 26. "We are proud to say we are multicultural."
Around 30 percent of the 21,000 residents in this neighborhood were immigrants or foreigners in 2019, according to France's national statistics institute.
Sixteen teams registered this year, the event's fourth edition, to play 31 games over three weeks. On this June night, we are down to the finals. The Ivory Coast, a veteran team that won the inaugural tournament in 2019, is back in its orange and green jerseys, trying to reclaim the title. Challenging them is Mauritania -- a team packed with young players, many of them semiprofessionals, wearing yellow and brown. The jerseys were created by a celebrated local designer who collaborates with Nike, and who has been invited to the presidential palace.
It is just one sign of how the tournament has matured. This year, the neighborhood city hall provides a small grandstand on one side of the court. Everywhere else, spectators stand, claiming their spots a good hour before the game begins.
By the time the referee blows his whistle, we are standing eight rows thick.
The court measures just 25 meters by 16.5 meters -- about 82 feet by 54 feet -- roughly one-seventeenth of FIFA's recommended field size. It is framed by a low concrete wall, topped by a tall chain link fence.
The confined area makes for an intense game of precision, tight tricks, bursts of speed and a blasting ball that echoes against the walls and crashes into the fence every few minutes.
This is soccer by inches, with a team losing and gaining the ball within seconds.
Camara and other organizers devised the rules: five players per team on the court; no offside; corner kicks are thrown in; any foul after the fifth within a half results in a penalty kick; and games last 30 minutes to an hour, depending on their importance.
Two people livestream matches, and another camera is rolling for the referee to review plays.
The first year, all players had to be locals, but the rules have since loosened, allowing players from elsewhere to participate. But those who grew up competing on the court quickly reveal themselves by using the side walls to their advantage, bouncing passes around defenders to their teammates and back to themselves.
Martin Riedler, who three years ago formed the tournament's French team, compared it to a boxing ring.
"You have to be on your toes the whole time, which makes the experience so intense," said Riedler, who attended Santa Clara University in California on a soccer scholarship. He has packed his team with elite players who can hit the cross bar from the halfway line of a full field, but who also find the arena overwhelming. "You know you won't sleep at night after a game."
Players slam each other to the turf, then pick one another up. They continually battle against the wall, so close that a spectator might graze them through the fence. They offer up-close renditions of spectacular maneuvers, flicking the ball over their opponents' heads and spinning it around their feet. That is one of the beauties of a small court, the referee Bengaly Souré tells me. It's a compression chamber of technical plays.
"There's no space, but they create space," he said.
When a player jumps and kicks the ball into the net midair, Souré turns to the fence and expresses his admiration.
The crowd is part of the fun. Spectators shout their observations over the sounds of African beats, booming from loudspeakers. It is agreed that the player wearing No. 7 for Mauritania -- who plays for a team in Italy -- is a dangerous force. And though the Ivory Coast falls increasingly behind, the game could turn at any moment.
"I've seen a team that's losing 4-1 make a comeback," said Makenzy Kapaya, a 37-year-old artist who grew up in the Goutte d'Or but later relocated to a less cramped apartment elsewhere. Like many in the crowd, he has returned to watch the games and to reunite with childhood friends.
"If you have problems, people will help you here, no matter what your origins," Kapaya said.
The Goutte d'Or, a dense, working-class area, often makes news for unflattering reasons -- drugs, prostitution, violence. The library closed for months three years ago because employees said they had been repeatedly threatened by dealers selling near its doors. Following the fatal police shooting of 17-year-old Nahel Merzouk this summer and the subsequent protests across the country, the local police station was attacked.
Éric Lejoindre, the mayor of the 18th arrondissement, pointed out that local volunteers had been quietly helping with homework, cooking and housing for years. A group of therapists in the Goutte d'Or hold regular listening sessions, setting out chairs in an abandoned lot for passers-by to unload their burdens.
For all its problems, the neighborhood has huge heart, Lejoindre said.
"Locals know it, but sometimes we need it to emerge in a spectacular fashion," he said. "For me, CAN is one of those moments when the neighborhood can revel in being a bit exceptional."
After halftime, the Ivory Coast players rally, bringing the score to 9-7. But then Mauritania yanks the plug from their energy and dreams. As the sky dims into an inky night, and spectators hold up their phones as lanterns, Mauritania scores again. And again. And again. Boom, boom, boom. The players start to do little dances after each goal.
When Souré blows his whistle for full time, a crowd surges onto the tiny court to embrace the young Mauritanian team in a squealing cyclone of joy.
Camara, who will take a few weeks off before beginning preparations for next year's event, said he was continually surprised by how much joy the little tournament had brought to the neighborhood. At a time when anti-immigration sentiments are growing and identity politics are flaring in France, he said he considered it a unifying event. "We thought we were just starting something for fun," he said, "but we created something bigger."
Red and white fireworks burst above the little park in the heart of the Goutte d'Or. The celebration will continue for hours.

Blessing and Boogeyman: Advertisers Embrace A.I.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Many ads are easier to make with the fast-improving technology. It also poses a threat to an industry already in flux.
The advertising industry is in a love-hate relationship with artificial intelligence.
In the past few months, the technology has made ads easier to generate and track. It is writing marketing emails with subject lines and delivery times tailored to specific subscribers. It gave an optician the means to set a fashion shoot on an alien planet and helped Denmark's tourism bureau animate famous tourist sites. Heinz turned to it to generate recognizable images of its ketchup bottle, then paired them with the symphonic theme that charts human evolution in the film "2001: A Space Odyssey."
A.I., however, has also plunged the marketing world into a crisis. Much has been made about the technology's potential to limit the need for human workers in fields such as law and financial services. Advertising, already racked by inflation and other economic pressures as well as a talent drain due to layoffs and increased automation, is especially at risk of an overhaul-by-A.I., marketing executives said.
The conflicting attitudes suffused a co-working space in downtown San Francisco where more than 200 people gathered last week for an "A.I. for marketers" event. Copywriters expressed worry and skepticism about chatbots capable of writing ad campaigns, while start-up founders pitched A.I. tools for automating the creative process.
"It really doesn't matter if you are fearful or not: The tools are here, so what do we do?" said Jackson Beaman, whose AI User Group organized the event. "We could stand here and not do anything, or we can learn how to apply them."
Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence that uses data and algorithms to imitate how humans learn, has quietly powered advertising for years. Madison Avenue has used it to target specific audiences, sell and buy ad space, offer user support, create logos and streamline its operations. (One ad agency has a specialized A.I. tool called the Big Lebotski to help clients compose ad copy and boost their profile on search engines).
Enthusiasm came gradually. In 2017, when the advertising group Publicis introduced Marcel, an A.I. business assistant, its peers responded with what it described as "outrage, jest and negativity."
At last month's Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, the glittering apex of the advertising industry calendar, Publicis got its "I told you so" moment. Around the festival, where the agenda was stuffed with panels about A.I.'s being "unleashed" and affecting the "future of creativity," the company plastered artificially generated posters that mocked the original reactions to Marcel.
"Is it OK to talk about A.I. at Cannes now?" the ads joked.
The answer is clear. The industry has wanted to discuss little else since late last year, when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot and set off a global arms race around generative artificial intelligence.
McDonald's asked the chatbot to name the most iconic burger in the world and splashed the answer -- the Big Mac -- across videos and billboards, drawing A.I.-generated retorts from fast food rivals. Coca-Cola recruited digital artists to generate 120,000 riffs on its brand imagery, including its curved bottle and swoopy logo, using an A.I. platform built in part by OpenAI.
The surge of A.I. experimentation has brought to the fore a host of legal and logistical challenges, including the need to protect reputations and avoid misleading consumers.
A recent campaign from Virgin Voyages allowed users to prompt a digital avatar of Jennifer Lopez to issue customized video invitations to a cruise, including the names of potential guests. But, to prevent Ms. Lopez from appearing to use inappropriate language, the avatar could say only names from a preapproved list and otherwise defaulted to terms like "friend" and "sailor."
"It's still in the early stages -- there were challenges to get the models right, to get the look right, to get the sound right -- and there are very much humans in the loop throughout," said Brian Yamada, the chief innovation officer of VMLY&R, the agency that produced the campaign for Virgin.
Elaborate interactive campaigns like Virgin's make up a minority of advertising; 30-second video clips and captioned images, often with variations lightly adjusted for different demographics, are much more common. In recent months, several large tech companies, including Meta, Google and Adobe, have announced artificial intelligence tools to handle that sort of work.
Major advertising companies say the technology could streamline a bloated business model. The ad group WPP is working with the chip maker Nvidia on an A.I. platform that could, for example, allow car companies to easily incorporate footage of a vehicle into scenes customized for local markets without laboriously filming different commercials around the world.
To many of the people who work on such commercials, A.I.'s advance feels like looming obsolescence, especially in the face of several years of slowing growth and a shift in advertising budgets from television and other legacy media to programmatic ads and social platforms. The media agency GroupM predicted last month that artificial intelligence was likely to influence at least half of all advertising revenue by the end of 2023.
"There's little doubt that the future of creativity and A.I. will be increasingly intertwined," said Philippe Krakowsky, the chief executive of the Interpublic Group of Companies, an ad giant.
IPG, which was hiring chief A.I. officers and similar executives years before ChatGPT's debut, now hopes to use the technology to deliver highly personalized experiences.
"That said, we need to apply a very high level of diligence and discipline, and collaborate across industries, to mitigate bias, misinformation and security risk in order for the pace of advancement to be sustained," Mr. Krakowsky added.
A.I.'s ability to copy and deceive, which has already found widespread public expression in political marketing from Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida and others, has alarmed many advertising executives. They are also concerned about intellectual property issues and the direction and speed of A.I. development. Several ad agencies joined organizations such as the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, which wants to trace content from its origins, and the Partnership on AI, which aims to keep the technology ethically sound.
Amid the doom and gloom, the agency Wunderman Thompson decided this spring to take A.I. down a peg.
In an Australian campaign for Kit Kat candy bars, the agency used text and image generators from OpenAI to create intentionally awkward ads with the tagline "AI made this ad so we could have a break." In one, warped figures chomped on blurry chocolate bars over a script narrated in a mechanical monotone: "Someone hands them a Kit Kat bar. They take a bite."
The campaign would be trickier to pull off now, in part because the fast-improving technology has erased many of the flaws present just a few months ago, said Annabelle Barnum, the general manager for Wunderman Thompson in Australia. Still, she said, humans will always be key to the advertising process.
"Creativity comes from real human insight -- A.I. is always going to struggle with that because it relies purely on data to make decisions," she said. "So while it can enhance the process, ultimately it will never be able to take away anything that creators can really do because that humanistic element is required."

Propaganda and an Ambiguous Message Are Both on View: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Josh Kline and the duo Komar and Melamid, in their respective museum shows, might seem to be telling you what to think -- but they dwell between irony and sincerity.
Corona and Coca-Cola, sparklers and flags, a picnic with family and friends -- it looks like a typical Independence Day in the United States -- except that the flags are Confederate, and they're being buried in a shallow grave.
This is the futuristic patriotic tradition envisioned by the multimedia artist Josh Kline in a three-channel video installation from 2017, titled "Another America is Possible," on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art.
Kline's piece seems heartfelt -- suspiciously so. This cinematic vision of Americans harmoniously disavowing a racist symbol has the dreamlike clarity of a pharmaceutical ad. It's sappy, clean, resolved -- a satire of progressive propaganda, goosing the libs.
Blunt sentiment, cushioned by an uncertain dose of parody, defines Kline's career-spanning survey at the Whitney, down to its grand, neocon-inspired title: "Project for a New American Century." The 43-year-old New Yorker flirts with the idioms of contemporary propaganda -- ads, memes, influencers -- just as the artist duo Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid tackled the posters, flags, and slogans of the Cold War. (Their retrospective, "A Lesson in History," filled the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., through July 16; a portion featuring work they made after relocating from the Soviet Union to New York in 1978 will reopen there in September.)
Propaganda tries (often in bad faith) to win an audience to a particular belief. Kline, Komar and Melamid argue that art actually represents a messier, unsettling, uncertain reality -- and therefore a more honest one. Rather than declaring a position, they dwell between irony and sincerity. This tang of ambivalence keeps their art from becoming the propaganda it evokes.
Komar and Melamid joined forces in the 1960s, working under the eye of the Soviet Union. (When they moved to New York later that decade, they turned their wit against capitalism.) They were part of a group of artists, called the nonconformists, who spurned and parodied Soviet propaganda by making art in its mold. One of their earliest interventions, from 1972, is a red banner bearing a slogan used to promote the Soviet space program: "We Were Born To Make Fairytales Come True."
Unlike any state-sanctioned banner, however, theirs is signed like a painting. Claiming the party line in an artwork starts to unravel its power -- in a museum, it's less than clear what that slogan means. Are artists purveyors of fantasy or revealers of truth? Can they be both at once?
This question becomes especially pointed in the duo's satires of Socialist Realism. A textbook form of art as propaganda, the style embellishes scenes of everyday workers and party heroes, hoping to inspire the people to greatness -- and quell dissent. Their painting, "The Origins of Socialist Realism," from 1982--1983, depicts a goddess resembling Botticelli's Venus tracing Stalin's lamplit silhouette on a stone temple. This meeting of historical and mythological figures, rendered like an official ideal, does more than mock the supposed sincerity of the style; it undermines the claim that art should distill the world into plain truths.
Kline must walk a blurrier line than Komar and Melamid. In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan liked to trot out a Russian saying: "Trust, but verify." Komar and Melamid went their separate ways in 2003, still largely committed to painting and conceptual art, not new media. Today, the country that won the Cold War is polarized by two political parties, and Kline's "Project for a New American Century" seems inundated with the cynical, murky morality of the internet.
Like an ambiguous political meme, Kline's work has a way of wrong-footing you for believing its message, but shaming you for doubting. Where Kline appears to endorse positions on climate change (he incorporates video testimonials from actors playing disaster survivors), income inequality (3-D prints of dismembered wage workers on carts and in boxes), police surveillance (his infamous statues of Teletubbies in riot gear) or any of the other issues treated in the Whitney survey, he's really just making art. Calls to action seem naïve. It's all an artist can do to portray the fractured, heavily mediated political landscape of the last decade, marred by deceptive video editing, deep fakes of public figures, troll farms, Twitter bots and other forms of dissemblance.
Nowhere is the sentiment as convoluted as in Kline's take on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 2015 video "Crying Games" uses outdated face-swapping software to paste pictures of the former President George W. Bush, the former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and the other architects of the wars onto actors dressed in prison jumpsuits, muttering and blubbering. "I'm sorry," says a fake Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld. "All those people ..."
The work is a dark joke -- it probably won't change minds, and it certainly won't un-ruin lives. But then, there's something beautiful about the way the shoddy digital mask glitches and falls away, revealing a look-alike of the former vice president Dick Cheney, mucus and tears streaming down his face. And there's a palpable sadness in the emptiness of Kline's righteous gesture, a sucking void at the video's center: the impossibility of truly mourning the war's victims.
Propaganda-like art won't undo the damage and confusion of actual propaganda. What Kline's work does, though -- and Komar and Melamid's, too -- is make space for ambivalence. Art shouldn't tell us what to think, and we shouldn't want it to.

Full text: Sporty & Rich, a popular line of merch that promotes healthy, luxurious living, is opening its first store-spa-cafe. Next stop: colonic clubs?
There was once an Instagram account called Sporty & Rich. For a time, it served no commercial purpose. It was more of a brain tickle of pleasing images: a mood board of supermodels, interiors and advertisements, mostly from the 1980s and 1990s.
It posted vintage Range Rovers and Rolexes and Ralph Lauren -- an affluent flavor of nostalgia occasionally punctuated by more modern references, like Frank Ocean's album cover, Phoebe Philo's designs for Céline, and President Barack Obama playing basketball. When it came to sports, it favored both the sexy (an up-skirt photo of a woman playing tennis) and the ironic (Joe Namath at 70, cocooned in a fur coat at the Super Bowl).
The account, created by Emily Oberg when she was 20 years old, was a hobby. It was an expression of her personal style, which she described as "mixing high and low, like sneakers with a designer bag, in a way I think is very common and ubiquitous now." At the time, Ms. Oberg was living in an apartment in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, and working as a video personality for the media company Complex.
But hobbies do not stay hobbies for long in the modern age. As her following grew, Ms. Oberg envisioned a print magazine. She envisioned a small line of merch: simple hoodies and tote bags and hats embroidered with "Sporty & Rich." Then she began to envision a different life for herself -- one of less hustle and more leisure. She moved to Los Angeles in 2018, and now her T-shirts are printed with phrases like "Health Is Wealth!" and "Drink More Water!"
The brand has also since grown, according to its chief executive, David Obadia, into an approximately $ 30 million business.
Now 29, Ms. Oberg has returned to New York to open Sporty & Rich's first retail location. The SoHo store will not only sell her vintage-inspired activewear and graphic loungewear, but also offer two spa services: a "lymphatic sculpting" massage and a "natural face-lift" facial that targets buccal fat. Instead of mannequins in the front window, there is a large sculpture of a glass of green juice, which will be served in the store's cafe along with bone broth, smoothies and coffee imported from Los Angeles.
Soon there will be Sporty & Rich skin-care products, and Ms. Oberg said she was working on developing dietary supplements and sex toys, too. If this all sounds a little familiar, that's intentional.
"I kind of want us to be a younger person's version of Goop," Ms. Oberg said while overseeing the unpacking of the new store last week. She had just flown in from Majorca. It was an oppressive 89 degrees in New York, and she wore a chambray shirt (Ralph Lauren) tucked into white jeans (Khaite) with stiletto-heel ankle boots (the Row) and a gold watch (Cartier).
"I don't think it really matters what we make," Ms. Oberg said. "I think people just want something that's Sporty & Rich."
The Gwyneth Playbook
In the years since she moved to Los Angeles, Ms. Oberg has been open about her personal health routines and experiments. Last year she published "The Sporty & Rich Wellness Book," a $ 100 coffee-table tome of advice and artful photos of toned-and-tanned models in states of undress.
In 2020, she told The Strategist she got "colonics a lot" and recommended her favorite at-home enema kit, which she said she used with coffee instead of water. In person, she talked about getting ozone therapy from a naturopath to help treat her autoimmune disorder, Graves' disease. "That's done through the rectum," she added.
Ms. Oberg knows that "people in wellness are heavily, heavily scrutinized," she said. She knows this from being "obsessed" with the Goop founder, Gwyneth Paltrow, a fellow fan of rectal ozone therapy who courts outrage on a biannual basis (most recently for discussing liquid diets). But Ms. Oberg also speaks from personal experience.
In 2020, she apologized for an Instagram post that compared the prices of fast food and snacks to "real food." (The price of a McDonald's Happy Meal, $ 3.57, was listed next to a bag of lettuce, $ 1.99.) She had written that people "don't need to be rich to be healthy" and should "stop making excuses" -- remarks that were criticized as insensitive and ignorant of the reality of food deserts. In her apology, Ms. Oberg explained that her post "was meant for people who DO have the option to choose a healthy lifestyle, not those who have no option or choice."
More remarks by Ms. Oberg resurfaced -- a since deleted Instagram account called @notsportyrich was devoted to aggregating them -- as when she identified as a "big time" anti-vaxxer on a giggly 2019 episode of "Failing Upwards" (a shock jock fashion podcast now known as "Throwing Fits," co-hosted by her former boss at Complex).
"I think that there were a lot of people who love to hate me, for whatever reason," Ms. Oberg said.
Asked about the vaccination backlash now, Ms. Oberg said she had treated the interview as a "silly" and "stupid" conversation with friends and didn't fully understand that her comments might upset people. She is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, she said, and "would never put other people in harm by not getting a vaccine." She attributed her beliefs in part to her upbringing.
"My mom was really into natural medicine and natural remedies and eating super-healthy and being active," said Ms. Oberg, who was raised in Calgary, Alberta, which has been compared to the Texas of Canada for its large oil industry and annual Stampede rodeo. "I was vaccinated when I was a baby, but slowly over time, she became more and more skeptical."
If Ms. Oberg's mother influenced her notions about health, her father, who immigrated to Canada from the Philippines, influenced her style and taste. He was an outdoorsman, skateboarder and sneaker collector who once dressed her in baby-size Air Jordans. He valued durability and longevity in products, having worked as a letter carrier, "pounding the pavement," he said, for the last 21 years.
Ms. Oberg described her childhood as comfortable, but not particularly Rich -- "that part of the brand was very much something that I always wanted and wish I had" -- or Sporty, other than being on the badminton team in high school.
"I was just obsessed with clothes and fashion," said Ms. Oberg, who began working in retail at 14 at Canada's elevated fast-fashion chain Aritzia, as well as the department store Holt Renfrew. She left Calgary at 18 for Vancouver, then moved to New York two years later to work with Complex's new video team in New York.
Complex is perhaps best known today for "Hot Ones," a series in which celebrities answer questions while sampling progressively spicier sauces. Ms. Oberg was best known for "Get Sweaty," a series in which celebrities answered questions while working out with her, and for interviewing hypebeasts waiting in line for hours outside Supreme.
Through Complex, she became a sort of micro-celebrity, particularly among young male streetwear fans, some of whom continue to comment on her Instagram photos. A bikini shot -- headless, as her selfies frequently are -- recently yielded the comment: "Like 10 years of getting thirst trapped and I'm still here." (Ms. Oberg said these kinds of comments don't bother her: "I don't like when girls who post all these sexual photos are like, 'How dare you objectify me.' It's like, 'What do you expect?"')
Yet Ms. Oberg has largely managed to transcend the "influencer" epithet. Her personal Instagram account may be conventionally aspirational -- frequent subjects include her European travels and concave stomach -- but it's not filled with sponsored posts. In the past, she has pointed out the absurdity of the influencer industry. She told the "Failing Upwards" podcast that she once was paid $ 12,000 to post for a makeup brand. She does not typically wear makeup.
"Emily was never into fame or fortune -- that's funny to say, because that's kind of where it's at right now," her father, Deo Abesamis, said. "I always try to tell her things like, 'This can be all gone tomorrow, so enjoy your time now.' And she realizes that."
She did recently experience one unfortunate rite of passage for the rich and famous: getting burgled. While on vacation with her boyfriend (a co-founder of the activewear brand Splits59), a number of items were taken from her new Beverly Hills home. The loot included four Hermès bags (two of them Birkins) and four Chanel jackets, all of which, she said, she had bought for herself.
She was surprisingly sanguine: "At first it was very sad, but it really is just things, and they can be replaced." Though not through her insurance, she said, which expired before the break-in.
Join the Club
Before devoting herself full time to Sporty & Rich, Ms. Oberg spent most of 2017 at Kith, the streetwear brand and store, working as the women's creative lead. She saw the more traditional fashion job as her exit ramp from media. But it wasn't the right fit.
"I didn't like working in an environment where there was no respect for a work-life balance," she said. She preferred "a very, very strong balance, sometimes way more leisure than work."
"I want a very simple life," Ms. Oberg continued. "We're making clothes, you know, we're not finding cures to diseases and viruses."
She was still consulting for other brands at the time, including Harmony, a Paris-based brand that she had once covered favorably for Complex. Harmony's founder, Mr. Obadia, described himself as an experienced "product-driven guy," but "not a fantastic guy when it comes to images and marketing." The work Ms. Oberg did for Harmony was remote, but she and Mr. Obadia kept talking, and soon she flew to Paris to meet him. They began dating.
"We said 'I love you' the very first day," Ms. Oberg recalled. "It was very intense."
While living between Los Angeles and Paris, they decided to work on a Sporty & Rich product drop together. When Mr. Obadia saw thousands of preorders roll in, he realized Ms. Oberg had something he never had: a strong following. He thought he could turn Sporty & Rich into a real, serious brand, not just a mood board with occasional drops.
Mr. Obadia, now 34, said he told Ms. Oberg: "You don't know how to manufacture items, you don't know how to operate a company, you don't know how to scale a company, but you have what matters the most. You have a true vision. So I'll do my part. You do yours."
Today most of Sporty & Rich's team is based in Paris with Mr. Obadia, who formalized his role as chief executive in 2019. (Ms. Oberg is still the sole owner of company, which employs about 25 people.) While he and Ms. Oberg are now exes, they are on good terms, they both said. There have been growing pains -- Ms. Oberg's near cancellation revealed that some customers were unhappy with issues in order fulfillment, which sometimes persist, and her brusque approach to customer service, which does not. But Mr. Obadia projected revenue to be from $ 28 million to $ 32 million this year, without any investment or outside funding.
The brand just rolled out the second part of a major collaboration with Adidas, and earlier this year released a 1970s- and 1980s-inspired tennis capsule with Lacoste. Ms. Oberg and Mr. Obadia are both tennis enthusiasts -- as a child, he dreamed of going pro -- and Sporty & Rich has helped lead the tenniscore trend.
"It's health and wellness as brand messages and aesthetics," said Marian Park, a fashion strategist who runs Miscellanea Studio, and who pointed to a number of newer brands emulating the same post-gym-Princess-Diana look, stamping their athleisure with similar tennis club-inspired logos and sweeping health mantras, like "sport is medicine." "Millennials and Gen Z, we're drinking less and smoking less than boomers, and we're all scared of getting older."
Ms. Park acknowledged that Sporty & Rich stumbled during Ms. Oberg's controversies in 2020. And yet, she said, "there is a huge segment of consumers that don't care about that or don't know about that and never will. As long as they're tapping into those lifestyle conversations around wellness and sport, it's always going to do well."
Bosse Myhr, the buying director for men's and women's wear at Selfridges in London -- one of more than 150 wholesale partners that stock Sporty & Rich -- painted the average Sporty & Rich customer at Selfridges as a 20-something woman "who likes to work out, who likes to be conscious about what she eats, and wants to look cool and relevant."
Mr. Myhr, who recalled meeting Ms. Oberg at a buffet brunch at Soho House in New York, cited the if-you-know-you-know clubby feeling around the brand. "You want to feel that you're part of it," he said.
That feeling is exactly where Ms. Oberg sees the future of the brand: clubs. She imagines creating "the place I want to go to that doesn't exist" -- a wellness center with tennis courts, a pool, restaurant, spa, naturopath "and colonics," she said, laughing. "For me, it's more about the world and the lifestyle that we've created rather than the product."
"This is kind of like a preview," she continued, waving an arm around her store-cafe-mini spa, which opens on Thursday, and whose bright primary colors were inspired by Esprit stores in the 1980s -- more sporty than rich.
"At first we had a different concept where it did go that more luxury route," she said. "Then I was like, 'Wait, this is not us. This needs to feel like us.' Just, you know, childish."

A Blessing and a Boogeyman: Advertisers Warily Embrace AI

The advertising industry is in a love-hate relationship with artificial intelligence.
In the past few months, the technology has made ads easier to generate and track. It is writing marketing emails with subject lines and delivery times tailored to specific subscribers. It gave an optician the means to set a fashion shoot on an alien planet and helped Denmark’s tourism bureau animate famous tourist sites. Heinz turned to it to generate recognizable images of its ketchup bottle, then paired them with the symphonic theme that charts human evolution in the film “2001: A Space Odyssey.”
AI, however, has also plunged the marketing world into a crisis. Much has been made about the technology’s potential to limit the need for human workers in fields such as law and financial services. Advertising, already racked by inflation and other economic pressures as well as a talent drain because of layoffs and increased automation, is especially at risk of an overhaul-by-AI, marketing executives said.
The conflicting attitudes suffused a coworking space in downtown San Francisco where more than 200 people gathered last week for an “AI for marketers” event. Copywriters expressed worry and skepticism about chatbots capable of writing ad campaigns, while startup founders pitched AI tools for automating the creative process.
“It really doesn’t matter if you are fearful or not: The tools are here, so what do we do?” said Jackson Beaman, whose AI User Group organized the event. “We could stand here and not do anything, or we can learn how to apply them.”
Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence that uses data and algorithms to imitate how humans learn, has quietly powered advertising for years. Madison Avenue has used it to target specific audiences, sell and buy ad space, offer user support, create logos and streamline its operations. (One ad agency has a specialized AI tool called the Big Lebotski to help clients compose ad copy and boost their profile on search engines).
Enthusiasm came gradually. In 2017, when the advertising group Publicis introduced Marcel, an AI business assistant, its peers responded with what it described as “outrage, jest and negativity.”
At last month’s Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, the glittering apex of the advertising industry calendar, Publicis got its “I told you so” moment. Around the festival, where the agenda was stuffed with panels about AI’s being “unleashed” and affecting the “future of creativity,” the company plastered artificially generated posters that mocked the original reactions to Marcel.
“Is it OK to talk about AI at Cannes now?” the ads joked.
The answer is clear. The industry has wanted to discuss little else since late last year, when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot and set off a global arms race around generative artificial intelligence.
McDonald’s asked the chatbot to name the most iconic burger in the world and splashed the answer — the Big Mac — across videos and billboards, drawing AI-generated retorts from fast-food rivals. Coca-Cola recruited digital artists to generate 120,000 riffs on its brand imagery, including its curved bottle and swoopy logo, using an AI platform built in part by OpenAI.
The surge of AI experimentation has brought to the fore a host of legal and logistical challenges, including the need to protect reputations and avoid misleading consumers.
A recent campaign from Virgin Voyages allowed users to prompt a digital avatar of Jennifer Lopez to issue customized video invitations to a cruise, including the names of potential guests. But, to prevent Lopez from appearing to use inappropriate language, the avatar could say only names from a preapproved list and otherwise defaulted to terms like “friend” and “sailor.”
“It’s still in the early stages — there were challenges to get the models right, to get the look right, to get the sound right — and there are very much humans in the loop throughout,” said Brian Yamada, the chief innovation officer of VMLY&R, the agency that produced the campaign for Virgin.
Elaborate interactive campaigns like Virgin’s make up a minority of advertising; 30-second video clips and captioned images, often with variations lightly adjusted for different demographics, are much more common. In recent months, several large tech companies, including Meta, Google and Adobe, have announced artificial intelligence tools to handle that sort of work.
Major advertising companies say the technology could streamline a bloated business model. The ad group WPP is working with the chipmaker Nvidia on an AI platform that could, for example, allow car companies to easily incorporate footage of a vehicle into scenes customized for local markets without laboriously filming different commercials around the world.
To many of the people who work on such commercials, AI’s advance feels like looming obsolescence, especially in the face of several years of slowing growth and a shift in advertising budgets from television and other legacy media to programmatic ads and social platforms. The media agency GroupM predicted last month that artificial intelligence was likely to influence at least half of all advertising revenue by the end of 2023.
“There’s little doubt that the future of creativity and AI will be increasingly intertwined,” said Philippe Krakowsky, the CEO of the Interpublic Group of Companies, an ad giant.
IPG, which was hiring chief AI officers and similar executives years before ChatGPT’s debut, now hopes to use the technology to deliver highly personalized experiences.
“That said, we need to apply a very high level of diligence and discipline, and collaborate across industries, to mitigate bias, misinformation and security risk in order for the pace of advancement to be sustained,” Krakowsky added.
AI’s ability to copy and deceive, which has already found widespread public expression in political marketing from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and others, has alarmed many advertising executives. They are also concerned about intellectual property issues and the direction and speed of AI development. Several ad agencies joined organizations such as the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, which wants to trace content from its origins, and the Partnership on AI, which aims to keep the technology ethically sound.
Amid the doom and gloom, agency Wunderman Thompson decided this spring to take AI down a peg.
In an Australian campaign for Kit Kat candy bars, the agency used text and image generators from OpenAI to create intentionally awkward ads with the tagline “AI made this ad so we could have a break.” In one, warped figures chomped on blurry chocolate bars over a script narrated in a mechanical monotone: “Someone hands them a Kit Kat bar. They take a bite.”
The campaign would be trickier to pull off now, in part because the fast-improving technology has erased many of the flaws present just a few months ago, said Annabelle Barnum, the general manager for Wunderman Thompson in Australia. Still, she said, humans will always be key to the advertising process.
“Creativity comes from real human insight — AI is always going to struggle with that because it relies purely on data to make decisions,” she said. “So while it can enhance the process, ultimately it will never be able to take away anything that creators can really do because that humanistic element is required.”

A Breakup With Diet Soda? The Glass Is Half Full.: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: If the World Health Organization's warning about the artificial sweetener has you worried, try these other refreshers.
The World Health Organization declared Thursday that the artificial sweetener aspartame is "possibly carcinogenic to humans," adding it to the same risk category as breathing in engine exhaust, working in dry-cleaning and consuming certain pickled vegetables.
The W.H.O. suggests you'd have to chug quite a bit of diet soda to enter the danger zone. Its new guidance for safe consumption is 40 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight, meaning that a committed diet-cola fan weighing 150 pounds could drink as many as a dozen cans a day.
Still, the news may give the jitters (caffeinated or not) to diet-drink die-hards. If you're ready to swear off the stuff, or at least moderate your habit, here are 11 aspartame-free alternatives to reach for instead.
Iced Tea
It doesn't look or exactly taste like diet cola, and it's not even fizzy. But the tannins in iced tea mimic some of that carefully honed Diet Coke complexity, and the caffeine will keep you from dropping off at your desk. Just go easy on the sugar.
Kombucha
Lightly caffeinated and made from fermented black or green tea, it's gently effervescent, judiciously sweet and may even be good for your gut microbiome -- or whatever microbiome your diet-drink habit has left you with.
Sparkling Water
Pick any brand or flavor. It fizzes and is available in a can, which gives you that same satisfying hiss-snap when you crack it open.
Seltzer and Bitters
A bar staple for many pregnant women and teetotalers, it's zippy, sort of sophisticated and very satisfying.
Pomegranate Juice and Club Soda
This concoction hits the same bright and tangy notes as an icy Diet Coke, and even better, the foam is a perky pink.
Prosecco
This is already the soda pop of sparkling wines. True, alcohol is listed by the W.H.O. as clearly carcinogenic, perhaps even in modest amounts. And Prosecco is hardly low-calorie. But hey, pick your poison.
Shrubs
Shrubs are a sort of locavore-hipster home brew made from fruit-infused vinegar and bubbly water. Bonus: They come in farm-to-table flavors like rhubarb-beet and turmeric-cucumber.
'Healthy Coke'
This one-time TikTok sensation is a cool draft of seltzer spiked with balsamic vinegar. It has the bubbles and mahogany hue of diet cola, and many TikTok-ers claim that it tastes just like it, too. Even better, you can pour it on your salad when you're out of vinaigrette.
D.I.Y. Cola
In his book "Homemade Soda," Andrew Schloss offers a recipe for "natural cola" made from fresh and dried citrus zest, coriander, nutmeg and Kitchen Bouquet browning sauce, adding optional gum arabic for "mouthfeel." Caroline Russock writes on the website Serious Eats that "its complexity is almost amaro-like -- dark and filled with rich, sweet aromatics, a more grown-up take on a cola." Carbonate it with a CO2 siphon for the fluffiest froth. For hard-core enthusiasts only.
Sugared Soft Drinks
These may be the versions you originally fell in love with. It may be tempting to get back in touch with your ex, but given the dietary perils of too much sugar or corn syrup, keep your hookups occasional.
Water
Here's the no-brainer solution: sugarless, easy to find and free. But even water carries risks. Drinking more than a quart or so per hour, particularly if you're doing something strenuous, can cause a dangerous electrolyte imbalance.
Really, too much of anything can harm you, so whatever you drink, do it in moderation.

Decision on Kennedy Files Leaves Some Unsatisfied: [National Desk]

Author: Baker, Peter

Publication info: Baker, Peter.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The president has finished a review first mandated by law in 1992, and while a vast majority of papers related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy have been released, some remain redacted.
On June 22, 1962, an intelligence official drafted a memo summarizing a letter intercepted between Lee Harvey Oswald and his mother. The memo was made public long ago. But for 60 years, the name of the letter opener was kept secret.
Now it can finally be told: According to an unredacted copy of the memo released recently by the government, the official who intercepted Oswald's mail for the C.I.A. in the months before President John F. Kennedy was assassinated was named Reuben Efron.
And that means -- what, exactly? A tantalizing clue to unraveling a complicated conspiracy that the government has sought to cover up for decades? Additional proof that the C.I.A. knew more about Oswald than initially acknowledged? Or a minor detail withheld all this time because of bureaucratic imperatives irrelevant to the question of whether Oswald was the lone gunman on the fateful day?
The mystery of Reuben Efron, who has been dead for three decades, may never be resolved to the satisfaction of some of those dedicated to studying the assassination. Thirty years after Congress ordered that papers related to the killing be made public with limited exceptions, President Biden has declared that he has made his "final certification" of files to be released, even though 4,684 documents remain withheld in whole or in part. Going forward, agencies will decide any future disclosures that may be warranted by the passage of time.
The president's certification, issued at 6:36 p.m. on the Friday before the long Fourth of July holiday weekend, when it would not draw much attention, has frustrated researchers and historians still focused on the most sensational American murder of the 20th century. But they suffered a setback on Friday when a federal judge refused to block Mr. Biden's order.
Jefferson Morley, the editor of the blog JFK Facts and the author of several books on the C.I.A., said the belated identification of Efron indicated that intelligence agencies still had something to keep from the American public.
"If they hid this guy's name for 61 years and they're still hiding other stuff, I would say they're still hiding sources and methods around Oswald," Mr. Morley said. "Why else did the name remain secret for 61 years? The C.I.A. is trying to slam the door now, and Biden's gone along with this."
From the other side of the spectrum, Gerald Posner, the author of "Case Closed," a 1993 book concluding that Oswald killed Kennedy on his own, said he doubted there was a smoking gun in the remaining files.
"Everyone is focused on the C.I.A. documents still withheld," he said. "What we have learned from the C.I.A. files released this year is that they either have nothing to do with the assassination, or are only tangentially related."
While he and Mr. Morley diverge on the historical evidence, Mr. Posner agreed that Mr. Biden's decision was "an abrogation of responsibility under the 1992 law" mandating release of the documents. Trust in the government being what it is, he said, the public will never accept official reassurances that there is no stunning revelation in the papers.
"I don't think that's there," he said, "but you'll only know when you have all the files available."
The intense interest in Kennedy conspiracy theories prompted Congress to pass the 1992 law mandating that documents related to the assassination be released within 25 years except those that could do "identifiable harm" to national security that outweighs the value of disclosure. When the deadline arrived in 2017, President Donald J. Trump, who has dabbled in conspiracy theories about the assassination himself, bowed to pressure from intelligence agencies to grant more time. After taking office, Mr. Biden signed two memos doing the same.
Of roughly 320,000 documents reviewed since the law passed, 99 percent have been disclosed, according to the National Archives and Records Administration. But 2,140 documents remain fully or partially withheld as a result of Mr. Biden's action, officials said, while another 2,502 remain withheld for reasons outside the president's purview, like court-ordered seals, grand jury secrecy rules, tax privacy limits or restrictions imposed by people who donated papers, and 42 for a mix of both.
A vast majority of excluded documents have actually been released but with certain parts redacted, officials said, including names of people still living, addresses, telephone or Social Security numbers, or locations of intelligence facilities. Officials said they were confident that none of the withheld information would change the essential understanding of the assassination.
While Mr. Biden's June 30 order means he is done, the archives and agencies have set up "transparency plans" so remaining redactions can be lifted in the future, such as upon the death of someone whose identity was protected.
The Mary Ferrell Foundation, an organization already suing the government over the files, sought an injunction against Mr. Biden after his latest order. But Judge Richard Seeborg of the Federal District Court in Northern California rejected it on Friday night and dismissed other parts of the original lawsuit, though he allowed some claims to proceed.
Lawrence Schnapf, a lawyer for the foundation, denounced Mr. Biden's action. "It is simply unfathomable to me that a man who has a bust of R.F.K. in his office and who voted for the law would cave in to the incredulous claims of the national security bureaucracy that 60-year-old records pose such a risk to national security that they cannot be released," he said.
The Justice Department declined to comment but maintained in its filings that the government had complied with the law. The C.I.A. did not respond to requests for comment. "This completes the review of records required by Congress and fulfills the president's commitment to maximizing transparency related to President Kennedy's assassination," said Adam Hodge, a spokesman for the White House.
The assassination still has enormous power to arouse suspicion. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has embraced conspiracy theories on vaccines and other matters and is now challenging Mr. Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination, said recently that the government had orchestrated a "60-year cover-up" in his uncle's killing.
"There's overwhelming evidence that the C.I.A. was involved in his murder," he told the radio host John Catsimatidis in May. "I think it's beyond a reasonable doubt at this point."
Mr. Trump, for his part, vowed to do in a second term what he did not in his first. "I released a lot, as you know. And I will release everything else," said in an interview in May with The Messenger, a new online news site.
The final 1,103 documents released days before Mr. Biden's order and those made public in preceding months offered new information that hardly seemed worth keeping cloaked so long. In April, for instance, a file was released with names of employees in the C.I.A.'s Mexico City station, mostly secretaries and translators. Another document listed 27 previously unreleased C.I.A. staff members' names; for whatever it is worth, the C.I.A. director John McCone's secretaries were named Marguerite Beard, Betty Davis and June Irish.
Whether any of the withheld documents would shed more light on Reuben Efron is unknown. His name on the mail intercept memo intrigued Mr. Morley. The memo was sent to Betty Egerter at a C.I.A. unit known as "the office that spied on spies." On the day of the assassination, Egerter's boss told the F.B.I. that the C.I.A. had no information on Oswald, who in fact had been monitored when he moved to the Soviet Union. A document released long ago showed that the agency opened Oswald's correspondence from Nov. 11, 1959, to May 1, 1960, and again from July 1, 1961, to May 25, 1962.
Curiously, Efron was previously listed as being in the room when the Warren Commission interviewed Marina Oswald, his Russian-born widow, in February 1964 -- the only one present whose title and role were not explained. Mr. Morley suspects Efron was monitoring the commission's investigation for James Angleton, the legendary C.I.A. official, essentially his "eyes and ears inside the room."
Efron was born in Lithuania in 1911 as Ruvelis Effronas and arrived in the United States via Cuba in 1939, according to immigration papers that described him as a 5-foot-3, 135-pound "merchant-salesman." In addition to English, he spoke Russian, Lithuanian, Hebrew, Yiddish and German, and served in the Air Force during World War II as an interpreter. His obituary said that after the war he was "a specialist on the Soviet Union and consultant on foreign affairs" without saying for whom.
In a harmonic convergence of conspiracy, Efron reported seeing a U.F.O. in 1955. He was traveling with Senator Richard Russell, Democrat of Georgia, and an Army colonel on a train trip through the Soviet Union when all three spotted what a C.I.A. report called two "flying saucers." Skeptics later suggested they were Soviet aircraft. Russell was among the Warren Commission members in the room for the Marina Oswald interview that Efron attended in 1964.
As it happened, Efron died on Nov. 22, 1993 -- the 30th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination. His wife has died too, and he had no known children. Efforts to reach other family members were unsuccessful.
"People say there's nothing significant in these files?" Mr. Morley said. "Bingo! Here's the guy who was reading Oswald's mail, a detail they failed to share until now. You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to think it's suspicious."
Mr. Posner finds it less suspicious but understands why others might. "Many of us have made up our minds," he said. "Some of us have made up our minds that there was a conspiracy, and some of us have made up our minds that it was Oswald.
"But in the end, we all want to see these files."

As Game Grows, Fresh Nations Leap Into The Limelight: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Vietnam, one of eight nations playing in their first Women's World Cup, will face the U.S. this week. Its presence highlights the growth of women's soccer, but also the challenges that remain.
When Vietnam fielded its first women's national soccer team in 1997, its players wore oversized jerseys made for men. At times, the team had to travel an hour and a half from Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, to reach an available training site. Some players pushed carts on the street and sold bread to sustain their nascent playing careers.
In the years after the Vietnam War -- called the American War here -- ended in 1975, economic reform took precedence over sports. The Vietnam Football Federation, which governs soccer in the unified country, was not established until 1989. In its early days, soccer was widely considered a game for men, too hard and demanding for women to play. With little money available, the sport hardly seemed a desirable career choice for girls. But that did not matter in most cases: Many parents were reluctant to let their daughters play.
"Society didn't accept the existence of such a team," said Mai Duc Chung, 74, Vietnam's women's national coach then and now.
A quarter of a century later, Vietnam is one of the dominant teams in Southeast Asia. This month, it will play for the first time in the Women's World Cup, starting with a game against the United States, the two-time defending champion, on Friday night (Eastern time) in Auckland, New Zealand.
Vietnam's arrival is the culmination of its nearly decade-long plan to develop women's soccer, in part through expansion of the World Cup field from 16 to 24 and now to 32 teams, making this year's tournament the largest in history. That growth is giving opportunities to nontraditional powers: Eight nations in this year's tournament, fully a quarter of the field, are participating for the first time.
This will be the biggest soccer moment for Vietnam and the other first-timers, a group that includes teams as diverse as Haiti, Ireland, Morocco and the Philippines. It will mean increased visibility and funding, enhanced professionalization of the sport and additional financial rewards. FIFA, soccer's global governing body, has promised at least $ 30,000 in prize money to each player participating in this year's tournament.
But that same growth will bring inexperience and the prospect of severe competitive imbalance when the newcomers face off against the world's best teams. It was with great fulfillment that Vietnam qualified ahead of its fiercest rival, Thailand. But gratification comes with burdensome pressure to avoid embarrassing performances, like losing by 13-0 to the United States, as Thailand did in the last Women's World Cup in 2019.
"We witnessed the fiasco, and it's a lesson learned for Vietnam," said Huynh Nhu, the team's star forward. She spoke through an interpreter, as did others interviewed for this article. "Thailand suffered such a big loss, they just kind of fell backward, and their fighting spirit is no longer there. No matter what happens against the United States and other powers, we will keep fighting."
Participating in the Women's World Cup represents great national pride and international sporting achievement for Vietnam, a country that has won only one Olympic gold medal (in air-pistol shooting, at the 2016 Rio Olympics) and has never qualified for the men's World Cup, and where men's soccer is better known for regular episodes of corruption and match fixing.
But similar pride and similar hardships overcome are echoed across the other debutantes in this year's field. Ireland's captain, Katie McCabe, grew up playing on boys' teams, encouraged by an older brother and parents who now watch her play for the London club Arsenal. Haiti's players navigated a national system in which federation officials have been accused of coercing young players into sex, and Morocco's overcame profound traditional biases and frequent family objections to become the first team from a majority Arab country to qualify.
Vietnam's team has come as far as any of them. Once shunned, or simply ignored, the Vietnamese women are now national names. They were welcomed by their country's prime minister after earning their World Cup place in a qualifying tournament in India last year and were given a parade on a double-decker bus through the streets of Ho Chi Minh City. Their World Cup matches will be broadcast live to their fellow citizens on various platforms.
More than any Vietnamese player, Huynh Nhu, 31, represents possibility and inequality that coexist in her country and, effectively, for women's soccer worldwide. She is the first female player from Vietnam to play for a club team in Europe, having scored seven goals in the recently completed season for Lank F.C. Vilaverdense in Portugal's top division. After the World Cup, Huynh Nhu is expected to extend her contract with the club, which has reportedly offered to double her salary to 3,000 euros (about $ 3,200 per month).
That is a stark contrast to the average salary of $ 200 to $ 300 per month in the semiprofessional women's league in Vietnam. On an annualized basis, those salaries remain below the country's per capita G.D.P. of $ 3,756.50 a year, according to the World Bank. Players often take second jobs to supplement their incomes. Before moving to Portugal last season, for example, Huynh Nhu operated a business selling coconuts in her rural hometown in the Mekong Delta.
She said that she now had corporate affiliations with Visa, Coca-Cola and LG electronics. And she is the face of the unprecedented news coverage and sponsorship attention currently being lavished on the Vietnamese women's national team. While away from their clubs and training and participating in international competitions, members of the national team can earn about $ 850 a month, according to Mai, the national coach. (Journalists said money was deducted for meals and housing.)
Players have also been awarded bonuses by the Vietnamese Football Federation and sponsors for recent triumphs. Not all bonuses are known, and it remains unclear exactly how much of the bonus pool is divided among the players and the coaches. But the publicized pool is equivalent to $ 8,000 apiece for winning the Southeast Asian Games in May for an eighth time and, according to journalists, $ 15,000 or more for qualifying for the World Cup. Bonuses are not always financial, either; they can also include motorbikes and cars.
Those figures are "very modest" compared with what top male soccer players can make in salary and endorsements in Vietnam, said Cao Huy Tho, an executive, former sports editor and longtime advocate for gender equity at Tuoi Tre, a leading newspaper in Vietnam. But "it's very meaningful, life-changing for the women, because most of them come from very poor backgrounds."
Huynh Nhu's family, for instance, is building a three-story home, which includes a shrine to her career and appears to be the tallest in the area, in her hometown, Tra Vinh.
Women in Vietnam's national league who do not play on the national team endure a far more modest existence. League attendance is extremely low, roughly 100 to 300 people per match, journalists said, leaving many businesses reluctant to sponsor teams.
When a team representing Son La Province in northwest Vietnam struggled to maintain sponsorships in recent years, its players' monthly salaries plummeted to as low as $ 130 or even $ 70 -- much less than could be earned doing factory work. Some players left for better-paying jobs, and Son La is no longer in the league. Last year, as the club faced disbanding, its coach, Luong Van Chuyen, lamented to an online newspaper that he had only four players available. The others, Luong said, "quit to return home to get married and to become workers."
The issue of disparate treatment of female soccer players reached the highest levels of government after Vietnam qualified for the Women's World Cup. In greeting the returning players, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh called them "diamond girls" but also noted that they still faced prejudice in playing what many still consider a man's game, as well as hardships resulting from precarious incomes and lack of security in retirement.
"We need to pay more attention to women's football," Pham said, calling on soccer officials, government agencies and sponsors to help develop a sustainable model for the sport. It is unclear what steps, if any, have been taken to pursue that goal.
Soccer was introduced to Vietnam in 1896 during the French colonial period. The country claims to have fielded Asia's first women's team, which played briefly against men in the early 1930s. After the Vietnam War, though, an unofficial prohibition of women's soccer existed into the early 1990s, according to Cao, the journalist who began covering the sport later that decade.
To circumvent the ban, Cao said, a sympathetic pharmacy executive in Ho Chi Minh City transported female players to matches against men's teams by hiding them in cargo trucks covered with tarpaulins. When a women's national team was officially formed in 1997, Nguyen Thi Kim Hong was one of the players who sold bread to maintain their careers.
"It was our passion only; money was never the purpose for the first generation," said Nguyen, now 51 and the goalkeeper coach for the women's national team.
Even some of today's current stars faced resistance from their parents when they began playing. Nguyen Thi Bich Thuy, 29, was the youngest of three children, and though her father had been a soccer player, her parents worried that if she moved away from home in central Vietnam, "nobody will mother you anymore." Eventually, she said, her father became her biggest supporter.
In February 2022, after Vietnam's bid for World Cup qualification nearly imploded as the coronavirus ravaged the women's team, Bich Thuy scored the most important goal in the country's history -- a deft touch with her right foot and a decisive and historic shot with her left in a 2-1 playoff victory over Taiwan, which FIFA refers to as Chinese Taipei. She dedicated the goal to her father, who died in 2016.
"I'm still feeling it now, like a dream," Bich Thuy said of the goal. "My father always expected a lot of me. I'm sure he would be happy to see that."
Huynh Nhu, the team's star, had more unconditional support from her parents. Her father, a former player, began coaching her when she was 3 or 4. Her mother worked in a market in rural Tra Vinh and brought home a soccer ball at Huynh Nhu's request. Her father said he had attached the ball to a rope to keep her from kicking it into a canal outside the home. Now she leads Vietnam's national team, with the aim of scoring a goal in the World Cup. That may be, for now, a more achievable goal than expecting to win a game in a group that includes the United States, the Netherlands (the 2019 World Cup runner-up) and Portugal, a fellow debutante that lies just outside the top 20 in the latest world rankings.
Told that the benefactor of Thailand's team at the 2019 Women's World Cup, one of the richest women in the country, had exhorted her players by saying, "If you score, I'll buy you a $ 5,000 Chanel bag," Huynh Nhu laughed.
"I look forward to having such a billionaire in my country," she said.

HANOI, Vietnam — When Vietnam fielded its first women’s national soccer team in 1997, its players wore oversized jerseys made for men.

Full text: The stars of the Food Network help a teenage patient make it through the long days in the hospital with no solid food.
When I was 15, I fell in love with the voice of Rachael Ray. That velvety contralto was the soundtrack of my days in the children's hospital I hated -- with its plaid curtains and kind nurses -- but called home.
For weeks I spent my days hopped up on morphine, in and out of consciousness, nestled in a snake hive of drip tubes and wires. I was intent on fighting off this invader without a name, but even more devoted to the tiny television set that was giving me an education on how to beat a meringue into submission or throw a "simple yet stunning" dinner party (even when one of the guests is a vegetarian).
What I remember most was the hunger. I was starving, literally. But I had the Food Network.
Under doctors' orders, I ate hardly anything -- not a drop of ginger ale, a bite of a cracker or even an ice chip. This was my first foray into a kind of forced asceticism, something that my body, ravaged by this yet-to-be-diagnosed disease, would frequently require. Ravenousness was embedded in my bones, a constant pang.
My gut was too inflamed, spastic and maniacal to handle nutrition by mouth, and the team of doctors proclaimed, with the nonchalance of those who could pop down to the cafeteria for a sandwich, that my digestive tract needed "a break" and should "cool down." Forgoing food by mouth was the way to get this done.
My fate was N.P.O. -- nil per os, Latin for "nothing by mouth." When I had run out of celebrity tabloids to inhale and dutifully completed my homework, I became fluent in medicalese, injecting abbreviations and obscure medical terms into my vocabulary. I learned that this diet -- or nondiet, really -- was the first step in getting my irate system back to a seemingly elusive homeostasis.
I soon received the decidedly unsexy, unglamorous diagnosis of Crohn's disease. It's one of those things -- chronic, incurable, but can be managed -- that can physically and financially debilitate you for long periods of time, in events called flares.
Without food, I became half girl, half robot, with angst coursing through me and machines pumping nutrition into my body intravenously in a process called T.P.N., or total parenteral nutrition. T.P.N. is a common treatment for a severe Crohn's flare. It bypasses the digestive system, giving your colon the ultimate vacation. How luxurious.
I lost the contours of a fully sane and satiated human, morphing and flattening into pure desire -- skin and bones, ribs visible, thighs that no longer touched -- and I became obsessed with the idea of preparing food and thoughts of my favorite meals. Roast beef. Buttery potatoes. Burgers so big and dripping with juices that you'd need six napkins. Most bewildering to those around me, I became obsessed with the Food Network.
Instead of food, I devoured clips of Paula Deen inserting pounds of butter into a cake recipe and Sandra Lee concocting something deliciously semi-homemade. Emeril Lagasse's shrieks of "Bam!" sounded even more authoritative through the fog of opioids. And watching Rachael Ray whip up something "delish" became a lustful experience through those hours of rotting in a hospital bed.
I grew accustomed to the emptiness of days unbroken by the familiar markers of mealtimes and instead became dependent on the intervals of carefully dispensed pain medications, always wanting more. I felt swathed and safe in that chemical cocoon and didn't realize, until years later, that what I had thought was feeling happy really meant being high.
All the while I was flipping through channels to see the beloved friends who were always there for me: Rachael, Emeril, Sandra, Paula.
The rays of the setting sun would blaze through the hospital windows. Then came the darkness that would allow me to see the TV screen with more clarity as I curled into the warm abyss of a sleeping aid -- "the good stuff" that sent me drifting off to a zone of semiconsciousness, free of pain, with dreams of lunches and Coca-Cola and a warm, full belly. The Food Network shows, with their bright colors and erotic displays of shiny spatchcocked chickens, were my proxy for a primal unmet need.
I endured the daily drone of doctors and medical residents who poked and prodded, promising "just a few more days of no food." This went on for weeks, with starts and stops along the way. The few days when I was allowed the most delectable of gastronomic wonders -- chicken broth and lemon water ice -- were followed by pains so searing and gruesome, and complications so life-threatening, that I would be forced back to square one.
I became an animal closing in on its prey, except the prey was a vanilla pudding cup and the messenger was some poor nurse named Liz. If I smelled food, I would devolve into a rageful miscreant, screaming at the visitors who had food with them and ordering them out of my room. I resented those who could tend to their most basic needs with such ease.
Psychologists and therapists tried to teach me breathing techniques and other coping mechanisms, which I scoffed at with laughs and eye rolls that only teenage girls know how to give. Even as some of my muscles atrophied, it seemed my middle finger functioned just fine. More than ever, I came to rely on the trusted TV hosts who grilled and baked with such ease. Imagine Ina Garten denying me a meal!
I try to think of when Food Became Good Again, when eating became a vehicle of pleasure and not pure pain. There's no perfect data point. That's the thing with having an illness that goes on and on: "Before" and "after" are irrelevant. Living in a body on fire requires you to tend to it like a garden -- carefully and meticulously and, most importantly, every day.
I say I have two jobs, my day job at a newspaper and a second as a secretary of myself and of my body. Skills include a deftness at wading through the health care system, an ability to scream on phones at middle-managing insurance agents and a knack for properly budgeting for "emergencies." One wrong move could mean a Crohn's flare or a hefty medical bill.
There came a time, after that initial stay in the hospital, when food became not the enemy, but a sort of benign suitor. After months of feeding tubes and stomach pumping, along with one helicopter "life flight" and surgery, I began to get over being sick. The drugs seemed to be working. The doctor's visits, though tiresome and often marred by procedural nonsense, were helping.
I was once again able to eat in a "regular" way -- small bites of pizza and greasy chicken tenders, crisp apples cloaked in drippy peanut butter, my favorite. The saccharine taste of Diet Coke and the zing of cheap black coffee are daily pleasures. Rachael, Ina and Emeril are still in the picture, but now when I watch them, at home, I can run to the fridge.

Aspartame Is Probably Here to Stay, Despite a Cancer Warning: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A health agency warned the artificial sweetener may be a carcinogen, but others say that risk is overblown and consumers flock to the taste.
About eight years ago, in response to customer concerns about possible health risks associated with the artificial sweetener aspartame, PepsiCo decided to remove the ingredient from its popular diet soda.
Sales flopped. A year later, aspartame was back in Diet Pepsi.
Today, the top three ingredients listed in the tiny print on the backs of cans and bottles of Diet Pepsi -- and on its competitor Diet Coke -- are water, caramel color and aspartame.
A trip through the grocery store reveals the ingredient on the labels of not only diet sodas but also diet teas, sugar-free gums, sugar-free energy drinks and diet lemonade drink mix. By some estimates, thousands of products contain aspartame.
The use of aspartame, which is often known by the brand name Equal, in food and beverage products has long been scrutinized. The latest iteration came on Thursday, when an agency of the World Health Organization declared that aspartame could possibly cause cancer and encouraged people who consume a significant number of beverages with aspartame to switch to water or other unsweetened drinks.
But even with the emergence of many new artificial sweeteners, as well as those that are plant- and fruit-based, Big Food just can't quit aspartame, and analysts don't expect it to this time. That's because the ingredient is one of the least expensive sugar alternatives to use, it works especially well in beverages and mixes, and people like the way it tastes.
There was also pushback about the urgency of the W.H.O.'s announcement. In a quick rebuke, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it disagreed with the findings, reiterating its stance that aspartame is safe. And a second W.H.O. committee said a 150-pound person would need to drink more than a dozen cans of Diet Coke a day to exceed the safe threshold for the sweetener.
"The big beverage companies have been doing contingency planning for months, experimenting with different sweeteners, with a goal of having the taste and quality of the diet beverages being as consistent as possible with existing products," said Garrett Nelson, who covers the beverage industry at CFRA Research. But they are not likely to change the recipe unless they see a significant drop in consumer demand based on the W.H.O. report, he said.
"If consumers really stop buying Diet Coke because of this report, if sales start to suffer, it might be time to go to Plan B," Mr. Nelson said.
Coca-Cola referred questions to the American Beverage Association, the lobbying arm for the industry. "Aspartame is safe," Kevin Keane, the interim president of the organization, said in a statement.
PepsiCo did not respond to questions for comment, but in an interview with Bloomberg Markets that aired on Thursday, Hugh F. Johnston, the chief financial officer of PepsiCo, said he did not expect a big consumer reaction.
"I do believe that, in fact, this is not going to be a significant issue with consumers based on just the preponderance of evidence that suggests aspartame is safe," Mr. Johnston said.
The assessment of the W.H.O. agency adds to consumer confusion around aspartame, but it is also the latest in a recent spate of research focusing on the potential risks and questioning the true benefits of artificial sweeteners. Just a few weeks ago, the W.H.O. advised against using artificial sweeteners for weight control, saying a review of studies did not show long-term benefit in reducing body fat in children or adults. The review also suggested that the sweeteners were tied to an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
This year, researchers at North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill released a study that found a chemical formed after digesting another sweetener, sucralose, breaks up DNA and may contribute to health problems.
For years, food and beverage companies and regulators have typically denounced research that raises questions about artificial sweeteners, broadly arguing that the studies were flawed or inconclusive or that the health risks were minuscule.
"A substantial body of scientific evidence shows that low- and no-calorie sweeteners provide effective and safe options to reduce sugar and calorie consumption," Robert Rankin, president of the Calorie Control Council, the lobbying association for manufacturers and suppliers of nearly two dozen alternative sweeteners, said in an emailed statement on Thursday.
Indeed, most food and beverage companies that use aspartame are reluctant to switch partly because aspartame is less expensive than other alternatives and is 200 times as sweet as sugar, meaning a little goes a very long way.
"One of the benefits of aspartame is that it's been made for so long that manufacturers have really refined the costs and processing of it so well and they get a superior product," said Glenn Roy, an adjunct organic chemistry professor at Vassar College who spent more than three decades working at food companies, including NutraSweet, General Foods and PepsiCo.
On top of that, the F.D.A. approved aspartame in 1974, giving companies decades of data and information on what aspartame can and cannot do in products. For instance, it can enhance and extend certain fruit flavors, like cherry and orange, making it a preferred sweetener for beverages and chewing gum. But when heated, aspartame loses its sweetness, making it less desirable for baked or cooked products.
Food and beverage companies are releasing new no- or low-sugar products in response to consumer demand, but many are being made with newer sweeteners, or a blend of sweeteners. Each new product undergoes a litany of sensory and flavor tests before it is released.
But for products that have been around for decades, like diet sodas, loyal customers are accustomed to a specific taste, and they could be turned off by changes in ingredients, scientists warn.

In a Paradoxical Double Feature, Bombs Meet Bombshells: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Some of the moviegoers planning on a "Barbenheimer" -- seeing both on the same day -- are relishing the incongruous subject matter of the two new releases.
One movie is bursting with life-size doll houses and blowout parties and so, so much pink. The other tells the origin story of the deadliest weapon in human history.
On July 21, with the opening of two of the most anticipated films of the year, "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer," thousands of fans will head to theaters to watch both movies on the same day -- relishing the irony of seeing two star-studded films with such incongruous themes.
"It's a juxtaposition to show the brightest and darkest sides of the human imagination," said Eden Schumer, a paralegal in Manhattan, who plans to wear a T-shirt featuring both "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" designs to the theater. "You're creating worlds and also destroying worlds."
This double feature -- branded "Barbenheimer" by the internet -- promises to be a cultural event, a movie buff's dream and a magnet drawing people back to theaters even as the movie industry struggles to compete against streaming services and recover prepandemic engagement.
More than 20,000 people have already purchased tickets to see "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" on the same day, according to Elizabeth Frank, the executive vice president of worldwide programming and chief content officer for AMC Theaters. From July 7 to July 10, AMC saw a 33 percent increase in the number of guests buying tickets for the double feature.
Even one particular celebrity with his own high-profile movie is getting in on the action.
Kevin Sabellico, a political consultant from Carlsbad, Calif., said he used to see movies multiple times a month, but stopped going during the pandemic. He hasn't been to a theater in more than a year.
"This is the event that will bring me back," Sabellico said. "I don't know why, but the duality of these films happening on the same day just has me captivated and wanting to see both on the big screen."
Like Sabellico, Jackson Kennedy, a graduate student at Stanford University, is ending a theatrical hiatus for the double feature.
"I haven't been to the theater this entire year, and now I'm going to spend all day in one," he said.
In which order should the movies be seen? The consensus seems to be "Oppenheimer" first: Take in the strong stuff, then end the night with a party.
"My friends and I in Chicago are spending our day at the Alamo Drafthouse and seeing the films the way the Lord herself intended: 'Oppenheimer' at 10 a.m. with a black coffee / 'Barbie' at 4:20 p.m. with a big Diet Coke," Andrea Ledesma, a marketing operations manager, wrote in an email.
Rita Wenxin Wang of Brooklyn, who is also starting with "Oppenheimer," decided to purchase tickets for the double feature after seeing dozens of memes and jokes juxtaposing the two movies online.
"It feels more fun to end the night on a fun light movie than a serious movie where someone builds an atomic bomb," Wang said.
Many other double-feature moviegoers are putting their outfits together accordingly. Thomas Cuda, from Jacksonville, Fla., said he plans to dress with a subdued style for "Oppenheimer" in the morning, perhaps wearing a suit. For the afternoon "Barbie" showing, he has something flashy planned. For the past year, he has had a pair of pink jeans -- a gift from his wife -- sitting in his closet.
"I haven't ever had the courage to give them a try, but I will be busting them out for 'Barbie,"' he said.
Cuda couldn't believe it when he found out the movies were both opening on July 21, a week and a half after his birthday. He decided to postpone his birthday celebration until next week.
"We're not going to spend any money. We're going to save it all. We're going big on release day," he said. "For me this is probably the third most important day of the year behind my anniversary and Halloween."

Aspartame Could Cause Cancer, W.H.O. Agency Says: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The F.D.A. and the powerful beverage industry protested the new findings, and a second W.H.O. group stood by its standard that the sweetener is generally safe.
A World Health Organization agency declared on Thursday that aspartame, an artificial sweetener widely used in diet drinks and low-sugar foods, could possibly cause cancer.
A second W.H.O. committee, though, held steady on its assessment of a safe level of aspartame consumption. By some calculations using the panel's standard, a person weighing 150 pounds could avoid a risk of cancer but still drink about a dozen cans of diet soda a day.
The declaration by a W.H.O. agency of a cancer risk associated with aspartame reflects the first time the prominent international body has weighed in publicly on the effects of the nearly ubiquitous artificial sweetener. Aspartame has been a contentious ingredient for decades.
The International Agency for Research on Cancer, or I.A.R.C., said it based its conclusion that aspartame was a possible carcinogen on limited evidence from three observational studies of humans that the agency said linked consumption of artificially sweetened beverages to an increase in cases of liver cancer -- at levels far below a dozen cans a day. It cautioned that the results could potentially be skewed toward the profile of people who drink higher amounts of diet drinks and called for further study.
Still, people who consume high amounts of aspartame should consider switching to water or other unsweetened drinks, said Dr. Francesco Branca, director of the W.H.O. Department of Nutrition and Food Safety.
But, he added: "Our results do not indicate that occasional consumption should pose a risk to most."
Concerns about rising global rates of obesity and diabetes as well as changing consumer preferences have resulted in an explosion of no- and low-sugar food and beverages. Aspartame, one of six sweeteners approved by U.S. regulators, is found in thousands of products, from packets of Equal to sugar-free gum, diet sodas, teas, energy drinks and even yogurts. It is also used to sweeten various pharmaceutical products.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approved aspartame decades ago, on Thursday issued an unusual criticism of the global agency's findings and reiterated its longstanding position that the sweetener is safe. In a statement, the F.D.A. said it "disagrees with I.A.R.C.'s conclusion that these studies support classifying aspartame as a possible carcinogen to humans."
The F.D.A. also said that "aspartame being labeled by the W.H.O. as 'possibly carcinogenic to humans' does not mean that aspartame is actually linked to cancer." The F.D.A. declined to make any of its experts available for interviews to discuss the agency's specific concerns.
But its salvo against the international organization was sure to ignite further debate in Europe -- where the sweetener is still deemed safe -- and renew review in the United States. And the dueling global agencies' pronouncements are likely to fuel confusion among consumers.
The W.HO. has occasionally been out of step with other authorities on potential cancer risks, like glyphosate, and later led the way toward establishing that it was dangerous to human health. The international body's designation of a cancer link to that ingredient in Roundup, a weed killer, became the stepping stone for lawsuits against the makers of the herbicide.
Around the world, the powerful beverage industry has fought long and hard against any regulatory or scientific finding that tied artificial sweetener use to risks of cancer or other health problems. Aspartame is only the latest battleground for multinational companies to push back against new studies or potential links to health risks.
"Aspartame is safe," Kevin Keane, interim president of the American Beverage Association, said in a statement. He cited the dueling W.H.O. announcements, singling out the second panel, the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, that performed a concurrent review and left its recommended daily intake amount unchanged. It also deemed the evidence for cancer in humans "not convincing," a W.H.O. summary shows.
"After a rigorous review, the World Health Organization finds aspartame is safe and 'no sufficient reason to change the previously established acceptable daily intake,"' Mr. Keane said. "This strong conclusion reinforces the position of the F.D.A. and food safety agencies from more than 90 countries."
Coca-Cola referred questions to the American Beverage Association and PepsiCo did not respond to requests for comment.
The safety of sugar replacements, including the decades-old science dispute over the use of saccharin in the diet drink Tab, has been heavily scrutinized. Once linked to bladder cancer in rats, Congress mandated further study of saccharin. Since then, according to the F.D.A., 30 studies showed the rodent results did not apply to humans; U.S. officials removed saccharin from a list of potential carcinogens. More recently, other sweeteners have come under scrutiny for their ties to possible health risks.
At the center of the dispute over aspartame are rodent studies from 2005-2010 by Italy-based researchers that showed a link to cancer. The F.D.A. has dismissed the long-debated studies as "compromised."
Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer of the American Cancer Society, which led one of the key studies the W.H.O. relied on, said the findings should be considered alongside the W.H.O.'s report earlier this year that indicated artificial sweeteners offered no help in achieving weight loss or protection from other chronic conditions.
He said there was little evidence now to suggest a daily Diet Coke would elevate the risk of cancer, adding that "more research is needed." Overall, he said, the science was more definitive on reducing cancer risk by avoiding tobacco, alcohol, processed meat and excess body weight.
The I.A.R.C. said it could not rule out the possibility that the studies linking aspartame to liver cancer were a result of chance or other factors associated with drinking diet soda.
The W.H.O.'s cancer agency has four categories: carcinogenic, probably carcinogenic, possibly carcinogenic and no classification. Those levels reflect the strength of the science rather than how likely the substance is to cause cancer.
The other W.H.O. group on food additives recommended that daily consumption should be below 40 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of a person's weight -- slightly lower than the suggested U.S. level of 50 milligrams.
The F.D.A. said it estimated that a person weighing 132 pounds would need to consume 75 packets of aspartame sweetener to reach the threshold of exposure to a potential risk.
For its review of aspartame, the I.A.R.C. convened 25 cancer experts from 12 nations in Lyon, France, to conduct the review of existing studies. It concluded that there was limited evidence for cancer in humans based on three studies linking artificially sweetened drinks to increases in hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer.
One study in 2016 was led by W.H.O. officials, who looked at nearly 500,000 people in Europe who were followed for about 11 years. The study tracked participants' juice and soft drink intake and the relationship to liver and bile duct cancers. It examined those who drank artificially sweetened soft drinks and found that each additional serving of diet soft drink a week was associated with a 6 percent increased risk of liver cancer.
A U.S. study published last year by researchers from Harvard, Boston University and the National Cancer Institute examined sweetened beverage consumption reported by people on questionnaires and cancer case registries. Researchers found an elevated risk of liver cancer in people with diabetes who said they consumed two or more artificially sweetened sodas a day. That study found no increase in liver cancer among diet soda drinkers who did not have diabetes.
A third study, led by the American Cancer Society, examined the use of beverages sweetened by sugar and artificial sweeteners and cancer death data. It found a 44 percent increase in liver cancer among men who never smoked and drank two or more artificially sweetened drinks a day. Even adjusting for high body mass -- in itself a cancer risk factor -- the men had a 22 percent increase in risk, data in a supplement to the study shows.
The American Beverage Association, which represents Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, has been vocal in saying that the W.H.O.'s food additive panel -- not the cancer experts -- should be the lead authority evaluating aspartame.
In recent weeks, the beverage industry trade group has financed a new coalition led by Alex Azar, an appointee of former President Donald J. Trump, and Donna Shalala, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton. Both Mr. Azar and Ms. Shalala were former secretaries of the Department of Health and Human Services. In an opinion article in Newsweek earlier this month, the two embraced the F.D.A.'s position on the safety of aspartame, and called the agency "the world's gold standard for independent regulatory bodies."
The trade group had previously contested another review of aspartame's potential links to cancer in California. In 2016, a state committee discussed reviewing aspartame, but it went no further.
California officials said this week that the state could review the latest W.H.O. decision.
Besides aspartame, the W.H.O.'s cancer agency has deemed other possible carcinogens to range from the seemingly benign, like Ginkgo biloba extract and aloe vera leaf extract, to the more concerning, like gasoline exhaust and perfluorooctanoic acid, the most common of the industrial chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, that has recently been subject to billion-dollar settlements over drinking water contamination.
In deeming aspartame a possible carcinogen, the I.A.R.C. also dipped into one of the central controversies of aspartame research. It concluded that there was some evidence for cancer in lab animals based on studies performed by the Ramazzini Institute in Italy, citing the group's finding of increased tumors in aspartame studies from the mid-2000s. Based on concerns over the group's methods and interpretations, though, the findings were deemed limited.
For its part, the Ramazzini Institute said in 2021 that its work on aspartame was validated and that its earlier findings were "savagely attacked by the chemical manufacturing and processed food industries and by their allies in regulatory agencies."
Dr. Branca of the W.H.O. responded to questions about the need for an I.A.R.C. review during a news conference on Wednesday, saying that 10 million people die of cancer each year. "So there's a societal concern that our organization needed to respond to," he said.
He said the results demonstrated a clear need for further high-quality research.
"We've in a sense raised a flag here, indicating that we need to clarify much more in the situation," Dr. Branca said. "It is not something which we can dismiss at this moment."

Full text: The maker of Gatorade and Lay's, which nearly doubled its profit in its latest quarter, has been raising prices by double-digit percentages for more than a year.
PepsiCo reported a big jump in quarterly profit on Thursday, despite signs that customers are buying fewer cans of soda and bags of chips as the company continues to raise prices aggressively.
Pepsi, which makes Gatorade, Lay's and Quaker Oats, also raised its forecast for earnings in the rest of the year, pushing its stock higher.
The company reported 10 percent growth in revenue, to $ 22.3 billion, and nearly doubled its profit since the same time last year, to $ 2.7 billion, in its second quarter, which ended June 17. PepsiCo said it expected revenue to grow 10 percent for the full year, up from its previous forecast of 8 percent.
The quarterly results exceeded analysts' already optimistic expectations, as consumers wrestle with higher prices while policymakers weigh their next move in their efforts to tame inflation.
Though Pepsi earned more last quarter, the amount of products it sold went down. The prices of its products have risen by double-digit percentages for the past six quarters, and the company has reported dipping sales volumes for the past three quarters.
Pepsi's prices overall were 15 percent higher in the second quarter than they were a year earlier. The increase was particularly pronounced in Pepsi's European division, up 20 percent. Rising food prices in Europe have attracted particular scrutiny from economists and policymakers, who have said corporate profits were contributing to stubbornly high inflation there.
"We've been able to raise prices and consumers stay within our brands," Ramon Laguarta, chief executive of Pepsi, said on a call with analysts Thursday morning.
Mr. Laguarta attributed low unemployment in the United States and across the world as a reason consumers have continued to buy Pepsi products. Data released last week showed the U.S. labor market cooling but still strong.
Inflation data released Wednesday showed that consumer prices in the United States, including food, have gone up at a slower rate, though are still a ways away from the Federal Reserve's goal. Overall, food prices rose 5.7 percent over the year through June.
PepsiCo's shares rose about 2.4 percent Thursday. The food and beverage giant is one of the first companies to report earnings each quarter, serving as a bellwether for how other companies may perform. Companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report a 7 percent decline in profit in the second quarter, according to estimates compiled by FactSet.
Coca-Cola and Nestlé will report earnings later this month. Several major banks will report their results on Friday.

Aspartame Is a Possible Cause of Cancer in Humans, a WHO Agency Says

A World Health Organization agency declared on Thursday that aspartame, an artificial sweetener widely used in diet drinks and low-sugar foods, could possibly cause cancer.
A second WHO committee, however, held steady on its assessment of a safe level of aspartame consumption. By some calculations using the panel’s standard, a person weighing 150 pounds could avoid a risk of cancer but still drink about a dozen cans of diet soda a day.
The declaration by a WHO agency of a cancer risk associated with aspartame reflects the first time the prominent international body has weighed in publicly on the effects of the nearly ubiquitous artificial sweetener. Aspartame has been a contentious ingredient for decades.
The International Agency for Research on Cancer, or IARC, said it based its conclusion that aspartame was a possible carcinogen on limited evidence from three observational studies of humans that the agency said linked consumption of artificially sweetened beverages to an increase in cases of liver cancer — at levels far below a dozen cans a day. It cautioned that the results could potentially be skewed toward the profile of people who drink higher amounts of diet drinks and called for further study.
Still, people who consume high amounts of aspartame should consider switching to water or other unsweetened drinks, said Dr. Francesco Branca, director of the WHO Department of Nutrition and Food Safety.
But, he added: “Our results do not indicate that occasional consumption should pose a risk to most.”
Concerns about rising global rates of obesity and diabetes as well as changing consumer preferences have resulted in an explosion of no- and low-sugar food and beverages. Aspartame, one of six sweeteners approved by U.S. regulators, is found in thousands of products, from packets of Equal to sugar-free gum, diet sodas, teas, energy drinks and even yogurts. It is also used to sweeten various pharmaceutical products.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approved aspartame decades ago, on Thursday issued an unusual criticism of the global agency’s findings and reiterated its longstanding position that the sweetener is safe. In a statement, the FDA said it “disagrees with IARC’s conclusion that these studies support classifying aspartame as a possible carcinogen to humans.”
The FDA also said that “aspartame being labeled by the WHO as ‘possibly carcinogenic to humans’ does not mean that aspartame is actually linked to cancer.” The FDA declined to make any of its experts available for interviews to discuss the agency’s specific concerns.
But its salvo against the international organization was sure to ignite further debate in Europe — where the sweetener is still deemed safe — and renew review in the United States. And the dueling global agencies’ pronouncements are likely to fuel confusion among consumers.
The WHO has occasionally been out of step with other authorities on potential cancer risks, such as glyphosate, and later led the way toward establishing that it was dangerous to human health. The international body’s designation of a cancer link to that ingredient in Roundup, a weed killer, became the steppingstone for lawsuits against the makers of the herbicide.
Around the world, the powerful beverage industry has fought long and hard against any regulatory or scientific finding that tied artificial sweetener use to risks of cancer or other health problems. Aspartame is only the latest battleground for multinational companies to push back against new studies or potential links to health risks.
“Aspartame is safe,” Kevin Keane, interim president of the American Beverage Association, said in a statement. He cited the dueling WHO announcements, singling out the second panel, the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, that performed a concurrent review and left its recommended daily intake amount unchanged. It also deemed the evidence for cancer in humans “not convincing,” a WHO summary shows.
“After a rigorous review, the World Health Organization finds aspartame is safe and ‘no sufficient reason to change the previously established acceptable daily intake,’” Keane said. “This strong conclusion reinforces the position of the FDA and food safety agencies from more than 90 countries.”
Coca-Cola referred questions to the American Beverage Association and PepsiCo did not respond to requests for comment.
The safety of sugar replacements, including the decades-old science dispute over the use of saccharin in the diet drink Tab, has been heavily scrutinized. Once linked to bladder cancer in rats, Congress mandated further study of saccharin. Since then, according to the FDA, 30 studies showed the rodent results did not apply to humans; U.S. officials removed saccharin from a list of potential carcinogens. More recently, other sweeteners have come under scrutiny for their ties to possible health risks.
At the center of the dispute over aspartame are rodent studies from 2005-2010 by Italy-based researchers that showed a link to cancer. The FDA has dismissed the long-debated studies as “compromised.”
Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer of the American Cancer Society, which led one of the key studies the WHO relied on, said the findings should be considered alongside the WHO’s report earlier this year that indicated artificial sweeteners offered no help in achieving weight loss or protection from other chronic conditions.
He said there was little evidence now to suggest a daily Diet Coke would elevate the risk of cancer, adding that “more research is needed.” Overall, he said, the science was more definitive on reducing cancer risk by avoiding tobacco, alcohol, processed meat and excess body weight.
The IARC said it could not rule out the possibility that the studies linking aspartame to liver cancer were a result of chance or other factors associated with drinking diet soda.
The WHO’s cancer agency has four categories: carcinogenic, probably carcinogenic, possibly carcinogenic and no classification. Those levels reflect the strength of the science rather than how likely the substance is to cause cancer.
The other WHO group on food additives recommended that daily consumption should be below 40 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of a person’s weight — slightly lower than the suggested U.S. level of 50 milligrams.
The FDA said it estimated that a person weighing 132 pounds would need to consume 75 packets of aspartame sweetener to reach the threshold of exposure to a potential risk.
For its review of aspartame, the IARC convened 25 cancer experts from 12 nations in Lyon, France, to conduct the review of existing studies. It concluded that there was limited evidence for cancer in humans based on three studies linking artificially sweetened drinks to increases in hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer.
One study in 2016 was led by WHO officials, who looked at nearly 500,000 people in Europe who were followed for about 11 years. The study tracked participants’ juice and soft drink intake and the relationship to liver and bile duct cancers. It examined those who drank artificially sweetened soft drinks and found that each additional serving of diet soft drink a week was associated with a 6% increased risk of liver cancer.
A U.S. study published last year by researchers from Harvard, Boston University and the National Cancer Institute examined sweetened beverage consumption reported by people on questionnaires and cancer case registries. Researchers found an elevated risk of liver cancer in people with diabetes who said they consumed two or more artificially sweetened sodas a day. That study found no increase in liver cancer among diet soda drinkers who did not have diabetes.
A third study, led by the American Cancer Society, examined the use of beverages sweetened by sugar and artificial sweeteners and cancer death data. It found a 44% increase in liver cancer among men who never smoked and drank two or more artificially sweetened drinks a day. Even adjusting for high body mass — in itself a cancer risk factor — the men had a 22% increase in risk, data in a supplement to the study shows.
The American Beverage Association, which represents Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, has been vocal in saying that the WHO’s food additive panel — not the cancer experts — should be the lead authority evaluating aspartame.
In recent weeks, the beverage industry trade group has financed a new coalition led by Alex Azar, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, and Donna Shalala, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton. Both Azar and Shalala were former secretaries of the Department of Health and Human Services. In an opinion article in Newsweek earlier this month, the two embraced the FDA’s position on the safety of aspartame, and called the agency “the world’s gold standard for independent regulatory bodies.”
The trade group had previously contested another review of aspartame’s potential links to cancer in California. In 2016, a state committee discussed reviewing aspartame, but it went no further.
California officials said this week that the state could review the latest WHO decision.
Besides aspartame, the WHO’s cancer agency has deemed other possible carcinogens to range from the seemingly benign, such as Ginkgo biloba extract and aloe vera leaf extract, to the more concerning, such as gasoline exhaust and perfluorooctanoic acid. (The latter is the most common of the industrial chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, that has recently been subject to billion-dollar settlements over drinking water contamination.)
In deeming aspartame a possible carcinogen, the IARC also dipped into one of the central controversies of aspartame research. It concluded that there was some evidence for cancer in lab animals based on studies performed by the Ramazzini Institute in Italy, citing the group’s finding of increased tumors in aspartame studies from the mid-2000s.

Full text: For a brief moment, after Celine canceled its men's wear show in Paris because of the recent unrest in France, there were concerns about whether last week's couture shows would go as planned. But by the time guests started to arrive at Alaïa, one of the first events of couture week, dutifully carrying the custom chairs that the brand had sent them to sit on, it had become clear: The shows would go on.
At Schiaparelli, gold adornments and the house's signature Surrealist details were on full display. Thom Browne, for his debut couture show, turned an opera house into a wonderland full of fantastical suiting. Valentino showed ethereal gowns against the backdrop of the Château de Chantilly, a palatial property outside Paris and one of the most extraordinary venues I've ever photographed. Cardi B, who sat in several front rows, was seemingly the must-have celebrity guest of the season.
In the crowds outside the shows, there was noticeably less peacocking. Some people retired bright palettes for more subdued monochromatic looks. Others traded boxy clothes, which have dominated the style of guests and fans in recent years, for pieces with softer, more fluid silhouettes.

Prime, a Drink Fueled by YouTube Influencers And a Load of Caffeine, Is Drawing a Backlash: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, has asked the F.D.A. to investigate a popular beverage created by the YouTube influencers Logan Paul and KSI over its high caffeine content.
The release of Prime, a drink brand founded by the YouTube personality and boxer Logan Paul, had British teenagers lining up for hours outside grocery stores on its release date in December. Some supermarkets were even forced to limit purchases to one bottle per customer.
Now, Prime is facing a backlash from physicians and lawmakers who say that the high levels of caffeine in one of its drinks can be harmful to children. At a news conference in New York on Sunday, Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, called for the Food and Drug Administration to investigate the ultra-caffeinated variety of Prime, which he pointed out has caffeine levels equivalent to about six 12-ounce cans of Coca-Cola.
Prime offers two kinds of beverages: Prime Hydration, a sports drink that does not contain caffeine, and Prime Energy, a highly caffeinated drink. A 12-ounce Prime Energy contains 200 milligrams of caffeine, compared with the 114 milligrams of caffeine in a 12-ounce can of Red Bull or the 100 milligrams found in a cup of coffee. Pediatricians recommend that children under the age of 12 avoid caffeine entirely, and those from 12 to 18 should consume no more than 100 milligrams per day.
Senator Schumer said Prime Energy had "so much caffeine in it that it puts Red Bull to shame." He added that Prime differed from other highly caffeinated energy drinks in that its advertising campaign appeared to target those under 18.
Mr. Paul, a high-profile provocateur known for his controversial videos, has long faced questions over the example he sets for young people. He has won two Teen Choice awards, decided mainly by voters ages 13 to 19, and when he is pursued by his loyal fans, known as the Logang, they often skew young. He launched Prime in 2022 with Olajide Olayinka Williams Olatunji, a 30-year-old rapper and another prominent YouTube personality known by his online alias, KSI.
In a letter to Dr. Robert Califf, head of the F.D.A., on Monday, Senator Schumer urged the agency to investigate the beverage company.
"Many physicians have serious concern for Prime, and I write to specifically urge your agency to investigate Prime for its claims, marketing and caffeine content," Senator Schumer wrote.
Prime said in a statement to The New York Times that each can of its energy drink "states clearly" that it was not made for anyone under the age of 18. The company added that the beverage had caffeine levels comparable to other top-selling energy drinks and that Prime was compliant with F.D.A. guidelines.
The official backlash comes as America's major beverage companies vie for a piece of the rapidly growing market for energy drinks. Over the past five years, sales in the energy drink industry have surged from $ 12 billion to $ 19 billion, according to Circana, a market research firm. Recently, companies like Pepsi and Gatorade have both invested in new caffeine-addled beverage lines, and shares of Monster Energy, another caffeinated beverage, surged 30 percent in the past year. Experts say the excitement has been fueled in part by a decades-long pivot away from sugary sodas.
Senator Schumer said at the Sunday news conference that parents had brought Prime to his attention. But the energy drink is part of a growing field of high-caffeine drinks popular among young people on TikTok. These drinks include the brand Alani Nu, supported by the social media influencer Addison Rae, and Celsius, which is backed by Pepsi.
Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a pediatrician at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital who joined Senator Schumer at the news conference on Sunday, wrote in an email to The Times that regularly consuming as much caffeine as is found in Prime Energy can disrupt the sleep cycle, which is essential to a child's developing brain.
High caffeine consumption can also give consumers the jitters and cause digestive issues, headaches, heart palpitations and even abnormal heart rhythms, she added.
Mr. Paul rose to fame as a popular YouTube personality and has since ventured into other avenues such as acting and boxing.
Representatives for Mr. Paul did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
A Prime representative said in a statement that it was "very important" to distinguish between the two drinks on the market, one of which -- Prime Hydration -- was also immensely popular among young consumers and did not contain any caffeine.
"We welcome discussions with the F.D.A." on industry changes necessary to protect consumers, a Prime representative added.
But Dr. Bracho-Sanchez said the manner in which the companies were marketing the two beverages -- with flashy packaging and a social media blitz pushed to younger consumers -- made it difficult to tell them apart. The "energy" branding was also misleading, she added.
"This is not true energy. This isn't a good night's sleep followed by a nutritious meal, this is a caffeine rush followed by a crash."

Full text: Amazon, Box, Salesforce, Oracle and others have recently rolled out A.I.-related products to help workplaces become more efficient and productive.
Earlier this year, Mark Austin, the vice president of data science at AT&T, noticed that some of the company's developers had started using the ChatGPT chatbot at work. When the developers got stuck, they asked ChatGPT to explain, fix or hone their code.
It seemed to be a game-changer, Mr. Austin said. But since ChatGPT is a publicly available tool, he wondered if it was secure for businesses to use.
So in January, AT&T tried a product from Microsoft called Azure OpenAI Services that lets businesses build their own A.I.-powered chatbots. AT&T used it to create a proprietary A.I. assistant, Ask AT&T, which helps its developers automate their coding process. AT&T's customer service representatives also began using the chatbot to help summarize their calls, among other tasks.
"Once they realize what it can do, they love it," Mr. Austin said. Forms that once took hours to complete needed only two minutes with Ask AT&T so employees could focus on more complicated tasks, he said, and developers who used the chatbot increased their productivity by 20 to 50 percent.
AT&T is one of many businesses eager to find ways to tap the power of generative artificial intelligence, the technology that powers chatbots and that has gripped Silicon Valley with excitement in recent months. Generative A.I. can produce its own text, photos and video in response to prompts, capabilities that can help automate tasks such as taking meeting minutes and cut down on paperwork.
To meet this new demand, tech companies are racing to introduce products for businesses that incorporate generative A.I. Over the past three months, Amazon, Box and Cisco have unveiled plans for generative A.I.-powered products that produce code, analyze documents and summarize meetings. Salesforce also recently rolled out generative A.I. products used in sales, marketing and its Slack messaging service, while Oracle announced a new A.I. feature for human resources teams.
These companies are also investing more in A.I. development. In May, Oracle and Salesforce Ventures, the venture capital arm of Salesforce, invested in Cohere, a Toronto start-up focused on generative A.I. for business use. Oracle is also reselling Cohere's technology.
"I think this is a complete breakthrough in enterprise software," Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box, said of generative A.I. He called it "this incredibly exciting opportunity where, for the first time ever, you can actually start to understand what's inside of your data in a way that wasn't possible before."
Many of these tech companies are following Microsoft, which has invested $ 13 billion in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. In January, Microsoft made Azure OpenAI Service available to customers, who can then access OpenAI's technology to build their own versions of ChatGPT. As of May, the service had 4,500 customers, said John Montgomery, a Microsoft corporate vice president.
For the most part, tech companies are now rolling out four kinds of generative A.I. products for businesses: features and services that generate code for software engineers, create new content such as sales emails and product descriptions for marketing teams, search company data to answer employee questions, and summarize meeting notes and lengthy documents.
"It is going to be a tool that is used by people to accomplish what they are already doing," said Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at the I.T. research and consulting firm Gartner.
But using generative A.I. in workplaces has risks. Chatbots can produce inaccuracies and misinformation, provide inappropriate responses and leak data. A.I. remains largely unregulated.
In response to these issues, tech companies have taken some steps. To prevent data leakage and to enhance security, some have engineered generative A.I. products so they do not keep a customer's data.
When Salesforce last month introduced AI Cloud, a service with nine generative A.I.-powered products for businesses, the company included a "trust layer" to help mask sensitive corporate information to stop leaks and promised that what users typed into these products would not be used to retrain the underlying A.I. model.
Similarly, Oracle said that customer data would be kept in a secure environment while training its A.I. model and added that it would not be able to see the information.
Salesforce offers AI Cloud starting at $ 360,000 annually, with the cost rising depending on the amount of usage. Microsoft charges for Azure OpenAI Service based on the version of OpenAI technology that a customer chooses, as well as the amount of usage.
For now, generative A.I. is used mainly in workplace scenarios that carry low risks -- instead of highly regulated industries -- with a human in the loop, said Beena Ammanath, the executive director of the Deloitte A.I. Institute, a research center of the consulting firm. A recent Gartner survey of 43 companies found that over half the respondents have no internal policy on generative A.I.
"It is not just about being able to use these new tools efficiently, but it is also about preparing your work force for the new kinds of work that might evolve," Ms. Ammanath said. "There is going to be new skills needed."
Panasonic Connect, part of the Japanese electronics company Panasonic, began using Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service to make its own chatbot in February. Today, its employees ask the chatbot 5,000 questions a day about everything from drafting emails to writing code.
While Panasonic Connect had expected its engineers to be the main users of the chatbot, other departments -- such as legal, accounting and quality assurance -- also turned to it to help summarize legal documents, brainstorm solutions to improve product quality and other tasks, said Judah Reynolds, Panasonic Connect's marketing and communications chief.
"Everyone started using it in ways that we didn't even foresee ourselves," he said. "So people are really taking advantage of it."

The Magic World's 50-Year Grudge: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: In 1973, Uri Geller claimed to bend metal with his mind on live television. Skeptics couldn't beat him. Now they've joined him.
In 1973, a young man named Uri Geller appeared on one of the BBC's most popular television shows, "The Dimbleby Talk-In," and announced that the laws of Newtonian physics did not apply to him. Or that, at least, was the implication. A handsome 26-year-old Israeli, dressed casually and flanked by a pair of academics, Mr. Geller performed a series of bewildering feats using nothing more, he said, than his mind.
He restarted a stopped watch. He duplicated a drawing that had been sealed in an envelope. Then he appeared to bend a fork simply by staring at it.
"It's cracking," Mr. Geller said quietly, speaking over a tight shot of his right hand, which was gently rubbing the fork between his fingers. "It's becoming like plastic."
A few seconds later, the top of the fork fell off and hit the ground. By the time the applause of the studio audience died down, Gellermania had begun.
Mr. Geller became not just a global celebrity -- a media darling who toured the world and filled auditoriums for dramatic demonstrations of cutlery abuse, with the humble spoon becoming his victim of choice -- but also the living embodiment of the hope that there was something more, something science couldn't explain. Because at the core of his performance was a claim of boggling audacity: that these were not tricks.
They were displays of raw psychic powers.
"I've never even seen a magic show," Mr. Geller, now a lean and tireless 76-year-old, said during a recent interview in Tel Aviv at the Uri Geller Museum, which he opened in 2021. "Except one: Siegfried and Roy in Las Vegas, because I missed a flight."
Charm and a seemingly bottomless supply of chutzpah were essential to his fame, and with fame came a one-man, multimillion-dollar enterprise, built on sales of tickets and books, and the reality TV show "The Next Uri Geller," which had versions in Israel, in the United States and around Europe.
It's a fortune he might have never earned, he said, without a group of highly agitated critics. Mr. Geller was long shadowed by a handful of professional magicians appalled that someone was fobbing off what they said were expertly finessed magic tricks as acts of telekinesis. Like well-matched heavyweights, they pummeled one another in the '70s and '80s in televised contests that elevated them all.
Mr. Geller ultimately emerged the victor in this war, and proof of his triumph is now on display in the museum: a coffee-table book titled "Bend It Like Geller," which was written by the Australian magician Ben Harris and published in May.
Timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the "Talk-In" appearance, the book celebrates Mr. Geller as a brilliant and highly original magical entertainer. Which represents a significant change of heart for Mr. Harris, who was once among Mr. Geller's most avid debunkers.
Today, Mr. Harris and Mr. Geller are friends who text or talk nearly every day. Mr. Harris looks back at his 1985 attack book, "Gellerism Revealed," as the work of an angry young man who had missed the point.
And the point is that Mr. Geller is an entertainer, one who'd figured out that challenging our relationship to the truth, and daring us to doubt our eyes, can inspire a kind of wonder, if performed convincingly enough. Mr. Geller's bent spoons are, in a sense, the analog precursors of digital deep fakes -- images, videos and sounds, reconfigured through software, so that anyone can be made to say or do anything.
Unlike a lot of self-help gurus, yogis and crackpot messiahs who rose to prominence in the early-1970s age of weird, Mr. Geller endured and his cultural impact proved both singular and lasting. Ikea produced a Geller stool, which had bent, wavy legs. Nintendo made a spoon-wielding Pokémon character, Kadabra, who could cause clocks to run backward. References to Mr. Geller, or mangled silverware, have appeared in songs by R.E.M., Toad the Wet Sprocket and Incubus, and made a memorable cameo in "The Matrix."
"It's not the spoon that bends," a bald tyke in a robe tells Neo, Keanu Reeves's character. "It is only yourself."
A mere handful of magicians have left anything close to this kind of imprint. If Mr. Geller can't actually bend metal with his brain -- and civility and fairness demands this "if" -- he is the author of a benign charade, which is a pretty good definition of a magic trick. Small wonder that the anti-Geller brigade has laid down its arms and led a rapprochement with the working professionals of magic. He is a reminder that people thrill at the sense that they are either watching a miracle or getting bamboozled. And now that fakery is routinely weaponized online, Mr. Geller's claims to superpowers seem almost innocent.
"I mean this in the most respectful way," said Andy Nyman, a magician and actor who a few years ago introduced a lecture by Mr. Geller at the Blackpool Magic Convention, an appearance that cemented this truce. "I think the world is aware that if he's fraudulent, there are bigger lies and bigger frauds out there that are far more damaging."
The best publicist in the world
A sloping 53-foot, 11-ton spoon made of rusting steel sits outside the Uri Geller Museum, in the ancient neighborhood of Old Jaffa. Throughout the day, tourists gather to gawk at the sculpture, and when Mr. Geller spots them, he often bounds down a flight of stairs to say hello and offer a quick performance.
"Where are you all from?" he asked a group of Austrians who gathered there one afternoon in May. As they answered, he quickly began to rub a spoon, which appeared to droop in his hands, that he autographed and tossed into the crowd, like a bouquet of flowers at a wedding.
"Thank you for coming to Israel!" he shouted as he walked off, to a round of applause.
The impromptu show lasted about a minute. He came, he bent, he left.
Mr. Geller is a vegan who doesn't drink or smoke, and he is always either moving or talking, usually both. During five hours of interviews over two days, he repeatedly said that he was shameless, which turns out to be one of his most winning qualities. He has a spoon tattooed on his right arm, which bends when he brings his hand to his shoulder, a hammy sight gag he'll perform for anyone.
He is less dogmatic about claims to otherworldly gifts now, preferring to call himself a "mystifier." Time and again, he emphasized his chops as a performer, a man who could mesmerize an audience, largely through ad-libbed interactions and charisma. When young magicians come and ask for advice, he suggests what amounts to a makeover.
"I tell them, 'Wear Armani T-shirts, buy Hermès after-shave, fix your teeth, smile a lot, be nice to people,"' he said, sitting in a chair in the middle of the museum. "This is the way to become famous and loved by your audience."
Mr. Geller never retired, though he doesn't travel much any more and spends nearly every day here, giving group tours -- no walk-ins, please -- to roughly 250 people each week. He spent $ 6 million buying and four years refurbishing the Ottoman-era soap factory, an investment he knows he will never recoup.
He and Hanna, his wife of 52 years, decided in 2015 to leave England, where the couple had raised their two now-adult children. The family had lived in a nine-bedroom mansion in a village outside London, with a Jacuzzi, tennis court, helicopter pad and glass meditation pyramid. His next-door neighbor was George Clooney; Jimmy Page lived down the street. The house is on the market for the equivalent of just under $ 10 million.
In Britain, Mr. Geller maintained the sort of profile that got him invited to appear on the TV show "I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!" as he found endless ways to insert himself into the news -- offering to stop Brexit telekinetically, taking credit for dislodging the tanker that was stuck in the Suez Canal.
"I'm the best publicist in the world, come on," he said, matter-of-factly. "You can promote Coca-Cola, you can promote a car. It doesn't matter, as long as you use my techniques, which are brilliant."
The museum tour he offers is a strange, slightly maddening way to spend an hour. Mr. Geller is a self-professed hoarder, and the place is essentially the contents of his attic, or a few storage bins, tastefully laid out as a permanent exhibition.
With a wireless microphone in hand, he seems intent on introducing visitors to every curio in the building. Here is a sculpture of a horse made of driftwood. That's a table designed by Versace. This is a piece of marble from the United Nations.
"Yoko Ono, amazing woman," he said, pausing by one of dozens of photographs. "She always wears Porsche glasses."
By the time you get to the 1976 Cadillac Fleetwood, covered with a few thousand bent spoons, you realize that the Uri Geller story isn't told at the Uri Geller Museum in a tour by Uri Geller. The experience ends with a somewhat perfunctory spoon bending ("Doesn't matter how I do it, whether it's real or not") and then a slightly off-key version of "My Way," in a recording sung by Mr. Geller himself, which plays over a montage of our hero with famous people -- including Salvador Dalí and Muhammad Ali.
"I have so many questions," said Gila Bublick, an American living in Israel, who was on the tour, sounding exhilarated and befuddled.
No questions were taken. Asked the next day why so little of his biography was in the tour, Mr. Geller said he thought his possessions were more interesting than his story.
Which is wrong.
Shouting 'Bend!' in unison
By the time Mr. Geller appeared on "The Dimbleby Talk-In," his career had already endured several near-death experiences. Raised in poverty as an only child, he said the first time he bent a spoon was while eating mushroom soup in his mother's kitchen around age 5. It didn't occur to him that this could be a profession until many years later, after he had left the army and was working as a courier and part-time model. At a photo shoot, he bent a photographer's key.
"The guy freaked out and said, 'I'm having a house party tonight, will you come and demonstrate your powers because nobody is going to believe me,"' Mr. Geller recalled. "I go and I'm stunned. I'm stunned by the reaction."
He soon was paid to perform at other parties, then small theaters, then larger ones. Each performance was unscripted and chaotic, its lack of polish only enhancing the sense that this was not a show.
Word spread about this hunky guy with the paranormal act. His first setback came in 1970, when a public relations man concocted and published a fabricated image of Mr. Geller with Sophia Loren, whom he'd visited in Rome. Ms. Loren's objections made front-page news in Israel, and Mr. Geller assumed he was finished. He asked his manager to cancel that evening's show in Haifa.
"I get to the theater that night, there are 400 people outside without tickets," he said. "It was sold out. That's when I realized controversy, for me, is a diamond on a silver platter."
There were soon more platters. In 1973, he was a guest on "The Tonight Show," and for 20 intensely awkward minutes Mr. Geller didn't even try to bend the objects laid out in front of him. (The vibe was wrong, he explained.) Astonishingly, viewers seemed to regard the failure as a sign of authenticity. Only someone at the mercy of the universe's unpredictable vibrations, went the theory, could have flopped like that.
His appearance on "The Dimbleby Talk-In," a few months later, was the performance of a daredevil who doesn't need a motorcycle to risk his life.
The two academics who sat on either side of Mr. Geller were, it turned out, both fans of the paranormal. (One, Lyall Watson, argued in a book that the emotions of plants could be registered on a lie detector.) The role of rational observer fell that evening to David Berglas, one of Britain's most famous magicians, who had been invited backstage by the show's host, David Dimbleby, to offer an instant assessment.
Now 96 years old, Mr. Berglas remembered the conversation in a recent phone interview.
"Can you do that?" Mr. Dimbleby asked him when the show was over.
"Of course," Mr. Berglas said. He then picked up a teaspoon and bent it after a brief rub.
"Yes," Mr. Dimbleby said, unimpressed, "but you're a magician."
'I basically call him a fraud'
One early Geller devotee was Mr. Harris, who watched the "Dimbleby" show from his grandparents' home in Sydney, Australia. He was 15 at the time and already a performing magician. After the broadcast, as instructed by Mr. Geller, he went to the kitchen, grabbed a utensil and willed it to bend. It did.
"I was totally sucked in," he said in a recent phone interview. "If it had been presented as a magic trick, I would have figured it out immediately. But this was something else, something standing on the edge of the unknown."
It was also something new. Psychic metal bending wasn't among the dozen or so genres of magic, like card tricks or levitation. And this guy didn't dress the part. He wore street clothes and lacked a patter. Briefly, Mr. Harris said, he imagined a better world, one in which the energy crisis was solved, in part, by mind power. Because if one guy could bend a fork, who knows what a few million people could achieve?
By 1976, Mr. Harris was becoming a doubter. That year, he attended a Geller show in Brisbane, along with about 4,000 others, and remembers an eccentric, riveting performance with a tray of spoons and keys provided by the audience and stretches of silence punctuated by inexplicable bends. After the show, Mr. Harris managed to get backstage, the first and only time he met Mr. Geller in person. He handed him a matchbox, wrapped in tinfoil and tape, containing a piece of metal.
"It was a challenge from a hyperactive young man," Mr. Harris said during a recent video call with Mr. Geller. "He started to unravel it, then said: 'No, no, no, you take it home, unravel it. See if it's bent and let me know."'
It was not bent. By then, Mr. Harris realized that the slight anomaly in his grandparents' spoon three years earlier had been there all along. Like many collections of well-worn utensils, they varied in curvature, something nobody ever had reason to notice until then.
Mr. Harris felt hoodwinked, which is why the book "Gellerism Revealed" is infused with the rage of disillusionment.
"I basically call him a fraud and charlatan," he said.
James Randi, a Canadian magician and escape artist, known professionally as the Amazing Randi, went much further. A relative unknown at the time, Mr. Randi, who eventually won a MacArthur Fellowship as a professional skeptic, was the loudest anti-Geller voice in the world.
"He is intending to enter the 'psychic healing' field soon, and when he starts into that racket he can kill people," he wrote in an edition of his book "The Truth About Uri Geller." He also called Mr. Geller a "dangerous and insidious figure," one he intended to stop "at all costs."
Those costs, it turned out, were high. Mr. Geller filed defamation lawsuits against Mr. Randi, including one for claiming that Mr. Geller was performing tricks once taught on the back of cereal boxes. The so-called cornflakes case ended with a dismissal, but over the years Mr. Randi burned through most of his $ 272,000 MacArthur grant covering personal legal expenses. He died three years ago and apparently loathed his nemesis to the end. He once asked that someone throw his cremated ashes into Mr. Geller's eyes, an obituary in The Economist stated.
The vitriol is a little hard to fathom. It's true that Mr. Geller had a lucrative side hustle in the 1980s working for mining companies who thought his putative psychic powers could help them determine where to dig. In a 1986 Financial Times story, he said that his standard fee was 1 million pounds per assignment, $ 3 million in inflation-adjusted terms, and that 11 companies had retained him.
Mr. Geller's track record as a prospector is not known, and he says he can't remember. But he never went into faith healing, nor did he charge enough to leave many with a case of buyer's remorse. He performed live shows and wrote books like "Use Your Psychic Powers to Have It All."
So watching the Geller haters now is like watching people run into nursery schools shouting that there is no Santa Claus. Consider Mr. Randi's appearance on Barbara Walters's talk show in 1974. He arrived soon after Mr. Geller had been there and entranced the host by bending her door key, apparently with his mind. Mr. Randi had now come to prove that there was nothing psychic about this feat.
"Here is my identical key," Ms. Walters told Mr. Randi, challenging him to equal Mr. Geller, and clearly hoping he would fail. "Touch it and make it bend."
A few moments later, the key is bent. Ms. Walters deflates. Suddenly, Mr. Geller seemed like a workaday huckster and the world seemed a little duller. She looked at the key that Mr. Randi had just bent and began theatrically boohooing, as if to say, "Thanks for nothing, you buzz killer."
The new sleight of hand
The science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke wrote that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic," and today magic and technology are merging. Start-ups in the field of artificial intelligence are the new masters of illusion; algorithms are the new sleight of hand.
"Geller's bent spoon demonstrations and deep fakes both create this conflict between what we think is possible and what we're seeing," said Alice Pailhès, an author of "The Psychology of Magic." "Both elicit strong emotional responses -- confusion, delight, distress, maybe even paranoia."
The stakes, of course, are different. Get fooled by a spoon bender and you're likely to end up with a smile on your face. Get fooled by a pernicious deep fake and you might end up believing that video posted last year of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine appearing to surrender, or something else that is false and noxious. This time, it's going to take much more than Mr. Randi and Ben Harris to flag the frauds.
The upsides of digital fakes have, inevitably, intrigued more than a few magicians. Drummond Money-Coutts, the English conjurer who starred in the Netflix series "Death by Magic," said in an interview that he was looking into possibilities presented by Midjourney, the program used to produce an image of Pope Francis in a Balenciaga puffer jacket that went viral a few months ago. He still prefers nondigital methods, though, which he attributes in no small part to the influence of Mr. Geller.
Mr. Money-Coutts first met Mr. Geller in 2003. A student at the British prep school Eton who was a budding magician, he invited Mr. Geller to perform for 700 gobsmacked schoolboys. ("I was told to write a letter to the catering department to apologize because they basically had no spoons for weeks after he came," Mr. Money-Coutts recalled.) Mr. Geller had relocated to Britain by then, having spent 12 tumultuous years in the United States, most of them in New York City.
While there, he had gotten rich, but he wasn't equipped for money or fame on this scale, and he was rattled by the verbal assaults. He struggled with panic attacks and became anorexic and bulimic. He also shopped compulsively, once buying 100 silk shirts during a visit to a Brioni store in Milan, few of which he ended up wearing.
"It was decadence," he said. "I had 10 Gucci suitcases, leather Gucci suitcases. Do you know how much they cost?"
Mr. Geller gradually regained his mental equilibrium, though his taste for luxury proved hard to shake. When he moved to Britain in the mid-80s -- a relative suggested it would be a better place to raise a family -- he fell in love with a house in Sonning, a village 40 miles west of London, because it reminded him of Graceland and the White House. He more than doubled the square footage of the place, adding bedrooms, a cinema room and gold-plated bathroom fixtures. At some point, about six years ago, it all started to seem berserk.
"I just looked at the marble and the crystal chandeliers," he said of Sonning Court, as the house is known, "and I thought, 'I've got to get out of this."'
He wanted to radically downsize, he said, and today he lives in a modest one-bedroom apartment not far from where he grew up. He has settled where he began. On the off chance that he can't truly bend metal with his mind, he has done something less miraculous but nearly as implausible: He has earned a very comfortable living for 50 years performing what is essentially the most acclaimed party trick of all time.
Now and then, he speaks to magicians, giving tips and what are essentially motivational speeches. Be original, be persistent, stick with a persona, he tells listeners. At the Blackpool Magic Convention in February 2020, he gave all that advice to a packed room, and he performed a newish effect. He poured radish seeds into his hand and asked everyone to chant "Sprout!" over and over. As he swirled the seeds with a finger, a close-up camera showed a green shoot that seemed to materialize in the middle of his hand, as though it had been willed to blossom.
"Among magicians," asked a cheeky young man, during the question and answer part of the presentation, "was that a magic trick? Did you sneak a bit of cress in with your seeds?"
"Are you serious?" Mr. Geller all but shouted, more amused than galled. "Do you really think that I'm going to say at the age of 73 that this was a trick? Get a life!"

TEL AVIV, Israel — In 1973, a young man named Uri Geller appeared on one of the BBC’s most popular television shows, “The Dimbleby Talk-In,” and announced that the laws of Newtonian physics did not apply to him. Or that, at least, was the implication. A handsome 26-year-old Israeli, dressed casually and flanked by a pair of academics, Geller performed a series of bewildering feats using nothing more, he said, than his mind.
He restarted a stopped watch. He duplicated a drawing that had been sealed in an envelope. Then he appeared to bend a fork simply by staring at it.
“It’s cracking,” Geller said quietly, speaking over a tight shot of his right hand, which was gently rubbing the fork between his fingers. “It’s becoming like plastic.”
A few seconds later, the top of the fork fell off and hit the ground. By the time the applause of the studio audience died down, Gellermania had begun.
Geller became not just a global celebrity — a media darling who toured the world and filled auditoriums for dramatic demonstrations of cutlery abuse, with the humble spoon becoming his victim of choice — but also the living embodiment of the hope that there was something more, something science couldn’t explain. Because at the core of his performance was a claim of boggling audacity: that these were not tricks.
They were displays of raw psychic powers.
“I’ve never even seen a magic show,” Geller, now a lean and tireless 76-year-old, said during a recent interview in Tel Aviv at the Uri Geller Museum, which he opened in 2021. “Except one: Siegfried and Roy in Las Vegas, because I missed a flight.”
Charm and a seemingly bottomless supply of chutzpah were essential to his fame, and with fame came a one-man, multimillion-dollar enterprise, built on sales of tickets and books, and the reality TV show “The Next Uri Geller,” which had versions in Israel, in the United States and around Europe.
It’s a fortune he might have never earned, he said, without a group of highly agitated critics. Geller was long shadowed by a handful of professional magicians appalled that someone was fobbing off what they said were expertly finessed magic tricks as acts of telekinesis. Like well-matched heavyweights, they pummeled one another in the ’70s and ’80s in televised contests that elevated them all.
Geller ultimately emerged the victor in this war, and proof of his triumph is now on display in the museum: a coffee-table book titled “Bend It Like Geller,” which was written by Australian magician Ben Harris and published in May.
Timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the “Talk-In” appearance, the book celebrates Geller as a brilliant and highly original magical entertainer. Which represents a significant change of heart for Harris, who was once among Geller’s most avid debunkers.
Today, Harris and Geller are friends who text or talk nearly every day. Harris looks back at his 1985 attack book, “Gellerism Revealed,” as the work of an angry young man who had missed the point.
And the point is that Geller is an entertainer, one who’d figured out that challenging our relationship to the truth, and daring us to doubt our eyes, can inspire a kind of wonder, if performed convincingly enough. Geller’s bent spoons are, in a sense, the analogue precursors of digital deepfakes — images, videos and sounds, reconfigured through software, so that anyone can be made to say or do anything.
Unlike a lot of self-help gurus, yogis and crackpot messiahs who rose to prominence in the early-1970s age of weird, Geller endured and his cultural impact proved both singular and lasting. Ikea produced a Geller stool, which had bent, wavy legs. Nintendo made a spoon-wielding Pokémon character, Kadabra, who could cause clocks to run backward. References to Geller, or mangled silverware, have appeared in songs by R.E.M., Toad the Wet Sprocket and Incubus, and made a memorable cameo in “The Matrix.”
“It’s not the spoon that bends,” a bald tyke in a robe tells Neo, Keanu Reeves’ character. “It is only yourself.”
A mere handful of magicians have left anything close to this kind of imprint. If Geller can’t actually bend metal with his brain — and civility and fairness demands this “if” — he is the author of a benign charade, which is a pretty good definition of a magic trick. Small wonder that the anti-Geller brigade has laid down its arms and led a rapprochement with the working professionals of magic. He is a reminder that people thrill at the sense that they are either watching a miracle or getting bamboozled. And now that fakery is routinely weaponized online, Geller’s claims to superpowers seem almost innocent.
“I mean this in the most respectful way,” said Andy Nyman, a magician and actor who a few years ago introduced a lecture by Geller at the Blackpool Magic Convention, an appearance that cemented this truce. “I think the world is aware that if he’s fraudulent, there are bigger lies and bigger frauds out there that are far more damaging.”
The Best Publicist in the World
A sloping 53-foot, 11-ton spoon made of rusting steel sits outside the Uri Geller Museum, in the ancient neighborhood of Old Jaffa. Throughout the day, tourists gather to gawk at the sculpture, and when Geller spots them, he often bounds down a flight of stairs to say hello and offer a quick performance.
“Where are you all from?” he asked a group of Austrians who gathered there one afternoon in May. As they answered, he quickly began to rub a spoon, which appeared to droop in his hands, that he autographed and tossed into the crowd, like a bouquet of flowers at a wedding.
“Thank you for coming to Israel!” he shouted as he walked off, to a round of applause.
The impromptu show lasted about a minute. He came, he bent, he left.
Geller is a vegan who doesn’t drink or smoke, and he is always either moving or talking, usually both. During five hours of interviews over two days, he repeatedly said that he was shameless, which turns out to be one of his most winning qualities. He has a spoon tattooed on his right arm, which bends when he brings his hand to his shoulder, a hammy sight gag he’ll perform for anyone.
He is less dogmatic about claims to otherworldly gifts now, preferring to call himself a “mystifier.” Time and again, he emphasized his chops as a performer, a man who could mesmerize an audience, largely through ad-libbed interactions and charisma. When young magicians come and ask for advice, he suggests what amounts to a makeover.
“I tell them, ‘Wear Armani T-shirts, buy Hermès after-shave, fix your teeth, smile a lot, be nice to people,’” he said, sitting in a chair in the middle of the museum. “This is the way to become famous and loved by your audience.”
Geller never retired, although he doesn’t travel much anymore and spends nearly every day here, giving group tours — no walk-ins, please — to roughly 250 people each week. He spent $6 million buying and four years refurbishing the Ottoman-era soap factory, an investment he knows he will never recoup.
He and Hanna, his wife of 52 years, decided in 2015 to leave England, where the couple had raised their two now-adult children. The family had lived in a nine-bedroom mansion in a village outside London, with a Jacuzzi, tennis court, helicopter pad and glass meditation pyramid. His next-door neighbor was George Clooney; Jimmy Page lived down the street. The house is on the market for the equivalent of just under $10 million.
In Britain, Geller maintained the sort of profile that got him invited to appear on the TV show “I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!” as he found endless ways to insert himself into the news — offering to stop Brexit telekinetically, taking credit for dislodging the tanker that was stuck in the Suez Canal.
“I’m the best publicist in the world, come on,” he said, matter-of-factly. “You can promote Coca-Cola, you can promote a car. It doesn’t matter, as long as you use my techniques, which are brilliant.”
The museum tour he offers is a strange, slightly maddening way to spend an hour. Geller is a self-professed hoarder, and the place is essentially the contents of his attic, or a few storage bins, tastefully laid out as a permanent exhibition.
With a wireless microphone in hand, he seems intent on introducing visitors to every curio in the building. Here is a sculpture of a horse made of driftwood. That’s a table designed by Versace. This is a piece of marble from the United Nations.
“Yoko Ono, amazing woman,” he said, pausing by one of dozens of photographs. “She always wears Porsche glasses.”
By the time you get to the 1976 Cadillac Fleetwood, covered with a few thousand bent spoons, you realize that the Uri Geller story isn’t told at the Uri Geller Museum in a tour by Uri Geller. The experience ends with a somewhat perfunctory spoon bending (“Doesn’t matter how I do it, whether it’s real or not”) and then a slightly off-key version of “My Way,” in a recording sung by Geller, which plays over a montage of our hero with famous people — including Salvador Dalí and Muhammad Ali.
“I have so many questions,” said Gila Bublick, an American living in Israel, who was on the tour, sounding exhilarated and befuddled.
No questions were taken. Asked the next day why so little of his biography was in the tour, Geller said he thought his possessions were more interesting than his story.
Which is wrong.
Shouting ‘Bend!’ in Unison
By the time Geller appeared on “The Dimbleby Talk-In,” his career had already endured several near-death experiences. Raised in poverty as an only child, he said the first time he bent a spoon was while eating mushroom soup in his mother’s kitchen around age 5. It didn’t occur to him that this could be a profession until many years later, after he had left the army and was working as a courier and part-time model. At a photo shoot, he bent a photographer’s key.
“The guy freaked out and said, ‘I’m having a house party tonight. Will you come and demonstrate your powers because nobody is going to believe me,’” Geller recalled. “I go and I’m stunned. I’m stunned by the reaction.”
He soon was paid to perform at other parties, then small theaters, then larger ones. Each performance was unscripted and chaotic, its lack of polish only enhancing the sense that this was not a show.
Word spread about this hunky guy with the paranormal act. His first setback came in 1970, when a public relations man concocted and published a fabricated image of Geller with Sophia Loren, whom he’d visited in Rome. Loren’s objections made front-page news in Israel, and Geller assumed he was finished. He asked his manager to cancel that evening’s show in Haifa.
“I get to the theater that night; there are 400 people outside without tickets,” he said. “It was sold out. That’s when I realized controversy, for me, is a diamond on a silver platter.”
There were soon more platters. In 1973, he was a guest on “The Tonight Show,” and for 20 intensely awkward minutes, Geller didn’t even try to bend the objects laid out in front of him. (The vibe was wrong, he explained.) Astonishingly, viewers seemed to regard the failure as a sign of authenticity. Only someone at the mercy of the universe’s unpredictable vibrations, went the theory, could have flopped like that.
His appearance on “The Dimbleby Talk-In,” a few months later, was the performance of a daredevil who doesn’t need a motorcycle to risk his life.
The two academics who sat on either side of Geller were, it turned out, both fans of the paranormal. (One, Lyall Watson, argued in a book that the emotions of plants could be registered on a lie detector.) The role of rational observer fell that evening to David Berglas, one of Britain’s most famous magicians, who had been invited backstage by the show’s host, David Dimbleby, to offer an instant assessment.
Now 96 years old, Berglas remembered the conversation in a recent phone interview.
“Can you do that?” Dimbleby asked him when the show was over.
“Of course,” Berglas said. He then picked up a teaspoon and bent it after a brief rub.
“Yes,” Dimbleby said, unimpressed, “but you’re a magician.”
‘I Basically Call Him a Fraud’
One early Geller devotee was Harris, who watched the “Dimbleby” show from his grandparents’ home in Sydney. He was 15 at the time and already a performing magician. After the broadcast, as instructed by Geller, he went to the kitchen, grabbed a utensil and willed it to bend. It did.
“I was totally sucked in,” he said in a recent phone interview. “If it had been presented as a magic trick, I would have figured it out immediately. But this was something else, something standing on the edge of the unknown.”
It was also something new. Psychic metal bending wasn’t among the dozen or so genres of magic, like card tricks or levitation. And this guy didn’t dress the part. He wore street clothes and lacked a patter. Briefly, Harris said, he imagined a better world, one in which the energy crisis was solved, in part, by mind power. Because if one guy could bend a fork, who knows what a few million people could achieve?
By 1976, Harris was becoming a doubter. That year, he attended a Geller show in Brisbane, Australia, along with about 4,000 others, and remembers an eccentric, riveting performance with a tray of spoons and keys provided by the audience and stretches of silence punctuated by inexplicable bends. After the show, Harris managed to get backstage, the first and only time he met Geller in person. He handed him a matchbox, wrapped in tinfoil and tape, containing a piece of metal.
“It was a challenge from a hyperactive young man,” Harris said during a recent video call with Geller. “He started to unravel it, then said: ‘No, no, no, you take it home, unravel it. See if it’s bent and let me know.’”
It was not bent. By then, Harris realized that the slight anomaly in his grandparents’ spoon three years earlier had been there all along. Like many collections of well-worn utensils, they varied in curvature, something nobody ever had reason to notice until then.
Harris felt hoodwinked, which is why the book “Gellerism Revealed” is infused with the rage of disillusionment.
“I basically call him a fraud and charlatan,” he said.
James Randi, a Canadian magician and escape artist, known professionally as the Amazing Randi, went much further. A relative unknown at the time, Randi, who eventually won a MacArthur Fellowship as a professional skeptic, was the loudest anti-Geller voice in the world.
“He is intending to enter the ‘psychic healing’ field soon, and when he starts into that racket he can kill people,” he wrote in an edition of his book “The Truth About Uri Geller.” He also called Geller a “dangerous and insidious figure,” one he intended to stop “at all costs.”
Those costs, it turned out, were high. Geller filed defamation lawsuits against Randi, including one for claiming that Geller was performing tricks once taught on the back of cereal boxes. The so-called cornflakes case ended with a dismissal, but over the years Randi burned through most of his $272,000 MacArthur grant covering personal legal expenses. He died three years ago and apparently loathed his nemesis to the end. He once asked that someone throw his cremated ashes into Geller’s eyes, an obituary in The Economist stated.
The vitriol is a little hard to fathom. It’s true that Geller had a lucrative side hustle in the 1980s working for mining companies that thought his putative psychic powers could help them determine where to dig. In a 1986 Financial Times story, he said that his standard fee was 1 million pounds per assignment, $3 million in inflation-adjusted terms, and that 11 companies had retained him.
Geller’s track record as a prospector is not known, and he says he can’t remember. But he never went into faith healing, nor did he charge enough to leave many with a case of buyer’s remorse. He performed live shows and wrote books like “Use Your Psychic Powers to Have It All.”
So watching the Geller haters now is like watching people run into nursery schools shouting that there is no Santa Claus. Consider Randi’s appearance on Barbara Walters’ talk show in 1974. He arrived soon after Geller had been there and entranced the host by bending her door key, apparently with his mind. Randi had now come to prove that there was nothing psychic about this feat.
“Here is my identical key,” Walters told Randi, challenging him to equal Geller, and clearly hoping he would fail. “Touch it and make it bend.”
A few moments later, the key is bent. Walters deflates. Suddenly, Geller seemed like a workaday huckster and the world seemed a little duller. She looked at the key that Randi had just bent and began theatrically boohooing, as if to say, “Thanks for nothing, you buzz killer.”
The New Sleight of Hand
Science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke wrote that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” and today magic and technology are merging. Startups in the field of artificial intelligence are the new masters of illusion; algorithms are the new sleight of hand.
“Geller’s bent spoon demonstrations and deepfakes both create this conflict between what we think is possible and what we’re seeing,” said Alice Pailhès, an author of “The Psychology of Magic.” “Both elicit strong emotional responses — confusion, delight, distress, maybe even paranoia.”
The stakes, of course, are different. Get fooled by a spoon bender and you’re likely to end up with a smile on your face. Get fooled by a pernicious deepfake and you might end up believing that video posted last year of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine appearing to surrender, or something else that is false and noxious. This time, it’s going to take much more than Randi and Harris to flag the frauds.
The upsides of digital fakes have, inevitably, intrigued more than a few magicians. Drummond Money-Coutts, the English conjurer who starred in the Netflix series “Death by Magic,” said in an interview that he was looking into possibilities presented by Midjourney, the program used to produce an image of Pope Francis in a Balenciaga puffer jacket that went viral a few months ago.

He also shopped compulsively, once buying 100 silk shirts during a visit to a Brioni store in Milan, few of which he ended up wearing.
“It was decadence,” he said. “I had 10 Gucci suitcases, leather Gucci suitcases. Do you know how much they cost?”

“Are you serious ?” Geller all but shouted, more amused than galled. “Do you really think that I’m going to say at the age of 73 that this was a trick? Get a life!”

Full text: Beka Gvishiani started as a fan, with little access to powerful people in fashion. Now he's at every show.
What does it take these days to become one of the most sought-after people reporting from fashion's front row? Beka Gvishiani, the man behind the hit Instagram account Style Not Com, will tell you, in the same straightforward language that defines Style Not Com, nostalgically named for Style.com, the groundbreaking Condé Nast site that brought runway fashion to the internet in 2000. (Style.com shut down and morphed into Vogue Runway in 2015.)
"The day Style.com closed, I thought, 'OK, there is no more Style.com. Sorry, Style not Com,"' Mr. Gvishiani said, explaining on a Zoom call from his new apartment in Paris how he came up with the name of his account. His feed, on which he posts bits of news, fashion trivia and his version of event coverage, is a sea of Yves Klein blue squares with white all-cap text, like a fashion "Jeopardy!" Infectiously enthusiastic, it has become an important newswire and bulletin for the fashion world.
Last week Mr. Gvishiani was at men's fashion week in Paris, where he seemed to be at every show. Sample dispatches read:
"It's Very, Very, Very Hot Inside Dior Show Venue."
"So, Pharrell Owned and Literally Shut Down Paris Tonight."
"I think we have to change the word 'Love' with 'Loewe.' I Loewe You."
What Mr. Gvishiani lacks in depth, he makes up for in good vibes. Sometimes he wishes designers and other industry veterans a happy birthday. Sometimes he calls out a P.R. firm or production team for doing a good job. The brands, which have an increasingly iron grip on the media, love the lack of criticism. (Or do they Loewe it?)
Flattery Will Get You Everywhere
Less than two years ago, Mr. Gvishiani, now 32, was a fashion obsessive who arrived at Paris Fashion Week from his home in Tbilisi, Georgia, with little more than a font and a dream.
It was September 2021, when fashion, like the rest of world, was still in a coronavirus fugue state. Mr. Gvishiani had only a few hundred followers, but a couple of influential ones, like the fashion documentarian Loïc Prigent, who started following Style Not Com after he was featured in a post.
Mr. Gvishiani wasn't invited to any fashion shows then, but he covered the Balenciaga show -- formatted like a red carpet before a screening of a special Balenciaga-themed episode of "The Simpsons" -- as if he were there.
"Lots of people started to share this post, even the Balenciaga P.R. team," Mr. Gvishiani said. Posting that the Chanel show will start in five minutes or that only one model wore sunglasses was, as Mr. Gvishiani said, "stuff that no one talks about and is at some point kind of stupid." Unless you're the person who's responsible for putting sunglasses on the model or making sure the show starts on time.
"They are behind the scenes, but they are very important people to create those fashion shows," said Mr. Gvishiani, who used to be one of those people, back in Tbilisi.
When Lucien Pages, who runs a namesake P.R. firm, saw a fawning post by Mr. Gvishiani in September 2021 -- he called it "the P.R. Agency of All Fashion Brands Dreams" -- he had mixed emotions. Mr. Pages's firm represents clients like JW Anderson, Coperni and Courrèges and handles events and fashion shows for houses like Saint Laurent and Loewe.
"It could have been a fake account or someone that is laughing about people from fashion," Mr. Pages said. "I was a bit like: 'What is that? Is it good? Is it bad? Is it cynical?' But he attracted my attention, so it was kind of smart."
By January 2022, Style Not Com had accrued about 10,000 followers. Bottega Veneta sought Mr. Gvishiani out. Clara Cornet, Instagram's head of fashion and beauty partnerships for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, set up a meeting. Her job is to identity Instagram accounts with potential and make sure they're maximizing engagement on the platform.
Mr. Gvishiani sent Ms. Cornet his wish list of shows he would like to attend during Paris Fashion Week. "I literally sent the full Paris fashion calendar," he said. "She started sending emails to all these big fashion P.R.s." The invitations followed. Including from Mr. Pages, who was charmed by Mr. Gvishiani's positivity and unapologetic fandom.
"We put him front row, and Loïc Prigent came to me and said: 'Wow, you put Style Not Com front row. That's brave.' I said, 'Well, why not?"'
A Lot of Logic and a Little Luck
Mr. Gvishiani is no rube. His trip to Paris in fall 2021 was an inflection point, and in the course of our three-and-a-half-hour interview he spared no detail about how he got from Point A -- a kid in Georgia blogging on the Fashion Spot, an online forum for fashion fans -- to Point B, on a chartered boat to see Pharrell Williams's fashion debut at Louis Vuitton.
"I'm the first generation of post-Soviet kids," Mr. Gvishiani said. "I lived this period when we were getting teasers of the outside world." A childhood obsession with graphics, logos and branding from Western entities -- Fanta, Coca-Cola, newspapers, tabloids -- led to his holy grail: glossy magazines, specifically Vogue Russia, available at only a few newsstands in his town.
"The ladies selling it used to keep me one copy," he said. On his Tumblr account, Glossy Newsstand, he curated covers and fashion features from as many international magazines as he could find on the internet. He searched management sites like Streeters and Art Partner to figure out who worked on the shoots -- hair and makeup artists, stylists, photographers, models -- tweeting and tagging them. Some followed back.
In 2013, Mr. Gvishiani requested accreditation for Tbilisi Fashion Week. "They thought I was some important fashion blogger," he said. Eventually a Georgian designer named Anouki Areshidze hired him to run social media for her Anouki label. Soon he was ordering fabric, packing boxes, producing look-book shoots, opening her first store in Tbilisi.
When Ms. Areshidze participated in a showroom for Georgian designers in Paris, she sent Mr. Gvishiani. Harvey Nichols Hong Kong placed an order. Anouki was invited to a designer showcase organized by Vogue and Yoox in Milan.
"Since the brand name was starting with A, we were usually the first one in the room, first one in the list," Mr. Gvishiani said. "Sometimes it's a lucky moment." Anna Wintour and Franca Sozzani, the famed Vogue Italia editor, stopped at Anouki first. Mr. Gvishiani took a photo with them and posted it to Instagram.
In one season, he said, 10 more stores picked up Anouki to sell.
After five years with Anouki, Mr. Gvishiani opened a creative agency named Arial Bold after the basic computer font. "Our idea was to take the very basic and general ideas but make them bold and recognizable in a different way," he said. He produced ad campaigns and fashion shows for Georgian designers as well as a Giambattista Valli x H&M event in Tbilisi.
Spring 2021 was the peak of the pandemic in Georgia. Everything was on hold. Mr. Gvishiani had just turned 30. He started Style Not Com. He bought a ticket to Paris.
Mr. Gvishiani does not consider himself a journalist or a critic, though he is highly reverential of those who are. Meeting Tim Blanks and Nicole Phelps, two veteran fashion journalists and critics, who were the faces of Style.com in its heyday, were fashion dreams come true.
What do Mr. Blanks, who now works for The Business of Fashion, and Ms. Phelps, who is the executive editor of Vogue Runway, think of Style Not Com?
"What he does is very different from what we did at Style.com and what we do at Vogue Runway," Ms. Phelps said. "Those short little headlines, the white Style.com font against the royal blue. They work even better than pictures. You can read it in a flash of a second, half of a second, and you're just scrolling."
Mr. Blanks said: "He's a keeper of the flame, In his slightly pell-mell coverage of the whole fandango, he is pointing out, I think, this ludicrousness of it. He's also sort of the ultimate testament to the power of the fashion dream, this transformative thing that happens to people when they get into the fashion industry. It's this funny Lana Turner-in-the-soda-shop-aspect of this world, that they can become stars kind of overnight."
An Influencer, With a Loophole
Mr. Gvishiani does not use Style Not Com to post products or photos of himself at events, which is how most of his peers cash in. Occasionally he posts runway videos or a clip from an event he attends. He wears his own clothes, usually suits with Birkenstocks and a blue Style Not Com baseball cap.
"When brands pay for my travel and for the hotel and I get invited to the show, I already feel good," Mr. Gvishiani said. In June, when Saint Laurent staged its men's spring 2024 runway show in Berlin, Style Not Com posted "Saint Laurent in Berlin" against a black square instead of its signature blue and shared the time and location of the event in the caption. Mr. Gvishiani said the brand did not pay him for the post.
The honor of being invited to a fashion show does not pay the rent, however, and things have quickly become transactional. Many posts are negotiated -- the specific subject, whether it's a show, a campaign, an event, if a video is included. Then a rate is determined.
Last year, Mr. Gvishiani introduced a Style Not Com book conceived as a year-in-review, in which every page is a full-bleed blue square chronicling some fashion happening. The book sells pages like advertising, but which posts and pages are ads remains undisclosed thanks to a loophole.
"My account is connected with Georgia, where I'm not obliged to mention the sponsored content for the brands," Mr. Gvishiani said, declining to name his paying clients. "This is a reason the brands like to work with me."
With 227,000 followers, Mr. Gvishiani does not have the biggest audience, but it is packed with industry heavy hitters. "You're relevant in real life rather than with your number of followers," Ms. Cornet said. "Does it mean being invited to shows? He is. Does it mean being close to certain creative directors and being able to get them directly over DM answering questions after the show? He is."
Mr. Gvishiani is keenly aware that his invitation to the fashion party is conditional. He is not interested in criticism or analysis.
"My account became known because of its positivity, because of its humor, bit of sarcasm, bit of irony," he said, noting that he uses these elements in every post.
"When people get drunk, when they get super-personal, when they start to speak only bad things about people, these are the stories that I'll never share," he said. "Yesterday someone told me that I'm more valued for the stories that I don't share."

A Big Dream Shifts Into Overdrive: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Of all the many Madonna-related posts that have appeared on social media since it was revealed that the artist had been taken ill and forced to postpone her "Celebration" tour, one in particular stood out -- not just because of what it said, but because of what it showed.
It was "M" herself, sitting conspiratorially at home with a pale bearded man -- the designer Guram Gvasalia of Vetements, the subversively indie brand that upended fashion in 2014 by elevating the anti-glamorous. Mr. Gvasalia, it turned out, had been secretly working with her for the last five months on the looks for "Celebration."
"Designing your costumes was such a privilege and honor," he wrote next to the picture, adding, "now I understand why you are who you are. You are a fighter, you are an icon, you are THE QUEEN."
If the timing seemed a little self-interested -- new dates for the tour have not yet been announced -- one thing was clear: Three decades after Madonna transformed the fortunes of another designer, Jean Paul Gaultier, via her "Blond Ambition" tour, the blockbuster that made Mr. Gaultier's cone bras into a symbol of sexual rebellion and his name forever a part of pop culture history, Mr. Gvasalia is hoping that even the appearance of her imprimatur may do the same for him.
"I think it gives you certain recognition and credibility," Mr. Gvasalia said of being chosen to work with Madonna. "When she can ask anyone in the world, and people will probably do it for free and be less complicated than I am, it gives you a certain security that you've done something right. It's really a blessing."
Certainly, if the tour happens, it will introduce Mr. Gvasalia, 37, to a much wider audience. He officially took over as creative director of Vetements only in late 2021, and before that was known primarily as the business partner and younger brother of Demna, the mononymic, much feted, latterly almost canceled designer of Balenciaga. (This despite the fact that the two brothers started Vetements together and Guram was as responsible as anyone for building it into a brand with 5.2 million Instagram followers and about 400 retailers worldwide.)
Along with the new Vetements collection, released digitally last week and featuring a bounty of grandiose proportions, the Madonna seal of approval may finally move him fully out of the shadow of his brother.
Though even there, his ambition, like his clothes, is outsize and impossible to miss. He did say he had made his trousers, puffers and skirts 16 times larger than normal in part because he was "trying to understand what is the maximum oversize I can make that still looks like clothes and you can wear but nobody else can make anything bigger."
Consider the Kardashians
History, not to mention literature, is rife with stories of sibling love and rivalry. It is one of our strongest, and most fraught, bonds. While fashion has had the occasional sibling partners -- Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen of the Row; Kate and Laura Mulleavy, who founded Rodarte; Dean and Dan Caten of Dsquared2 -- never before have two siblings who started together ended up quarterbacking fashion teams that are, if not exactly playing the same game, certainly aiming for a similar league.
"You guys really misunderstand how it is," Mr. Gvasalia said, referring to the fashion media. He was sitting on the terrace of the Aman hotel in New York, drinking a Coke and wearing big black boots with barnstormer platform treads, a white gold Cartier nail bracelet, two Cartier gold chain necklaces, a diamond wedding band, a Cartier panther ring and gold grills on his teeth.
"My brother is six years older. When I'm in the second grade, he's in the eighth. He got certain opportunities in life earlier. But if you consider where I am today, where my brother was when he was my age, I think I'm far more advanced."
Mr. Gvasalia tucked his hands through the giant rips in the thighs of his oversize black jeans as if they were pockets and took a breath. He can be charming and erudite and breathtakingly ego-centric, all at the same time.
"I give you the best example that everyone can relate to," he went on: "The Kardashians. You have Kim, who is a great person -- we think she's phenomenal -- and you have Kylie. Kylie's the young generation. She's been very successful without having sex tapes, without having to go through all the things that her sister had to go through. Another example is Venus and Serena Williams. They're both fantastic. But somehow there was a point where Serena managed to kind of take over.
"I think my brother is very talented, but I have a completely different approach to things. He had his good run of 10 years, and I think his era is slowly going to its finish line. Now it is my time."
Is that why he chose to post his Madonna reveal not long after the Balenciaga couture show?
"It's just the right time for us, after the momentum from our show," he said. Then he added, "Balenciaga always releases news on the day of our show, so I feel it's only fair." "Always" may be something of an exaggeration, though he did point out, "They announced Demna's appointment on my birthday." That was true (Oct. 7, 2015) though it's a long time to carry a grudge.
Sometimes it's hard not to wonder if Mr. Gvasalia knows what he is saying -- or how it may be received -- or if he is purposely trying to roil the pot. After all, said Julie Gilhart, chief development officer and president of Tomorrow Consulting, who started following Vetements not long after its debut: "There's nothing sloppy about Guram. I sat with him once in an airport lounge and saw the way his bag was organized -- it was perfect. Everything had a place. He never stops thinking. And he is very precise."
'It's not enough to be good. I need to be very good.'
Currently the two Gvasalias are trying to keep their public selves separate. Demna dropped his surname in late 2021. Guram said he would rather I not speak to his brother for this piece. When I requested comment from Demna anyway, he declined, via a spokeswoman, to respond.
Still, it's almost impossible to disentangle their stories.
Demna and Guram were born in Sokhumi, Georgia. When Guram was 7, civil war broke out and the family fled home, leaving everything behind. They spent a month lost in the mountains before eventually making their way to Düsseldorf, Germany, where the boys grew up. (In 2021, Guram told Forbes Georgia that if his family had stayed in Georgia, "I would probably be running for president.")
"They have a shared sense of survival that makes them very disciplined and resilient," said Jean Delmas, who, along with his partner, Heidi Yang, has been working with Guram as a sales agent for almost a decade.
Parental pressure dictated that Guram, like his brother, go to business school, but he also earned a master's degree at the London College of Fashion (he wrote his thesis on Martin Margiela), with after-school stints at Burberry and Selfridges. In 2012, he self-published a book called "Size Zero: A Guide to Spiritual Management" about "how you need to get rid of everything in your head and just listen to your heart." Two years later, he joined forces with his brother, who had been working at Margiela and Louis Vuitton, to start Vetements.
They decided to frame their new label as a "collective" because, Guram said, "we didn't want to put ourselves out there. It was always just about making the clothes and making what we felt was right." If pressed, they would say Demna was the creative one, and Guram the businessman.
"Everyone was kind of doing everything," Guram said. "You're a designer, a manager, a cleaning person; everything."
"No one really knew what was going on," Ms. Gilhart said. "But anyone who knew anything about the business knew Guram was a big part of it. He hears and sees everything."
Vetements detonated in the fashion world so effectively that in 2015, Demna was hired at Balenciaga. The next year, Guram
relocated to Zurich, along with the business -- a decision he said was less related to taxes than to the desire to get away from the fashion establishment. Zurich is German-speaking; German is one of the four languages he speaks fluently (the others are Georgian, Russian and English, though he is also pretty capable in French and Italian).
Demna and his husband soon followed, but by 2019, Demna announced he was leaving Vetements to focus his attention on Balenciaga; he has since left Zurich for Geneva.
"I find the world has for me completely different expectations than from everyone else," Guram said of the pressure he now feels. "The moment I do something, the bar is really super high. Because we changed the industry, because we were so shocking. And because my brother has a big name and has done a lot of things. Having him in my life puts more challenge on me. You know, it's not enough to be good. I need to be very good."
Lagerfeld dreams
According to Mr. Delmas, the move to designer was less of a leap for Mr. Gvasalia than the popular narrative may make it seem. "Even when Demna was there, Guram would edit the line," Mr. Delmas said. He would "add some pieces to what was in the showroom. He has a good idea of what is viable commercially."
Still, Mr. Gvasalia has begun to differentiate his Vetements, focusing more on tailoring and luxury fabrics. It is certainly priced like a luxury brand, with leather coats between $ 3,000- $ 10,000, and dresses that can run from a few thousand to more than $ 75,000. "The styling seems more involved, the fashion seems a little more high-concept," said Noah Johnson, the global style director of GQ, who said he was beginning to wonder if "maybe he was the mastermind of Vetements all along."
The most recent collection, Mr. Gvasalia's third, was rife with Easter eggs that reflect his dreams, goals and hangups. Alongside the acres of puddling denim paired with narrow corsetry and swaddling down were two very long, very Chanel-like coat dresses, shown over jeans, a nod to Karl Lagerfeld, whose longevity in fashion made him a role model for Mr. Gvasalia.
Also included: a choker necklace with an "M" at the front, a relic of his work with Madonna (she wore a similar necklace in an Instagram post in May). And a group of bell-shaped gowns with skirts six meters in diameter, integral gloves and face masks that, as Nicole Phelps wrote for Vogue Runway, bore a marked resemblance to the bell-shaped dresses Demna made for a Balenciaga show in 2019, spliced with the full-coverage bodysuit Balenciaga gown Kim Kardashian wore to the Met Gala in 2021.
"Those dresses, they're much, much smaller," Mr. Gvasalia said of the Balenciaga looks. "They have a completely different construction. And honestly, I think all the brands in the world have done these kinds of dresses. I also think if you look at them next to each other, ours are much better."
'There is still something coming.'
Mr. Gvasalia has spent the last five months hopping back and forth from his headquarters in Zurich to showrooms in Paris to New York, where Madonna is based.
In Zurich, he lives in a house on a lake just outside the city with his partner of almost 10 years, a Russian-raised entertainment mogul who asked to remain anonymous but has pitched in with the Vetements business so Mr. Gvasalia can concentrate more on the creative side. They also have an apartment on the Avenue George V in Paris, just across the street from the Four Seasons hotel (where his parents stay when they are in town) and up the street from the Balenciaga couture salons. They are, Mr. Gvasalia said, "perfect" together.
When Mr. Gvasalia comes to see Madonna in New York, he stays at the Aman. He does not collect art, but he does collect very high-end watches (Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet) as well as Hermès bags ("all in croc"); vintage Margiela, Gaultier and Montana; and nice cars. (His current ride of choice is a Rolls-Royce SUV.)
For years Mr. Gvasalia was very shy and refused to have his picture taken, Mr. Delmas said, but recently he has done something of an about-face, creating a public persona -- much as Karl Lagerfeld did -- that involves sweeping leathers with jutting shoulders and cinched waists, giant ripped black jeans, giant T-shirts, black shades and lots of jewelry.
He also acquired some custom-made grills from a dentist turned jeweler in New York whom he called the No. 1 grill person in the world. "He's from Israel but moved to New York and couldn't get his license," Mr. Gvasalia said. "He started to see rappers wearing the golden teeth, but the quality was horrible, so he said 'Oh, I'll make it properly for you.' He does grills for Pharrell, Madonna."
Mr. Gvasalia designed his to match his watches: a white and rose gold set to go with his white and rose gold Patek Nautilus. He likes the grills because they are not permanent, but, he said, "they add to the look, especially in summer, when you just have a T-shirt on."
During the January men's collections, show goers began noticing Mr. Gvasalia everywhere: in front rows and at clubs, in Daily Mail celebrity gossip columns holding hands with Avril Lavigne. He is friends with J Balvin, whom he met about a year ago when Mr. Balvin DM'd him on Instagram. Now, Mr. Balvin said, they text almost every day and "spend hours talking about fashion, watches, music and traveling -- gossiping."
Still, he often works until 5 or 6 in the morning, returning again at 10 a.m. His most recent show was the second most viewed spring 2024 men's collection on Voguerunway.com, coming in just after Vuitton and just before Prada. Mr. Gvasalia is, Vogue wrote, "on a roll." (Not long after, Beyoncé posted a photo of herself on Instagram in a pair of Vetements jeans.) According to Freddy Barassi, the vice president for men's wear at Ssense, it has stocked Vetements since 2015 and seen double-digit growth each season.
Next year will be Vetements' 10th anniversary. Mr. Gvasalia has plans. They are, characteristically, not small.
"Looking at people my age now, I'm not sure who is the competition," he said. "I had dinner yesterday with Sam Worthington. You know, the actor from 'Avatar.' I said, 'Sam, do you think you've had your biggest movie yet?' and he said, 'No, I think it's still coming.' And I feel for me, there is still something coming very big. I would not take a job today somewhere else. But one day if Chanel comes? I would not say no."

Full text: The last time Christine Dawood saw her husband, Shahzada, and their son, Suleman, they were specks on the North Atlantic, bobbing on a floating platform about 400 miles from land. It was Father's Day, June 18, and she watched from the support ship as they climbed into a 22-foot submersible craft called Titan.
Divers closed them inside by tightening a ring of bolts as the craft rolled on the waves about 13,000 feet above the 111-year-old wreckage of the Titanic.
Suleman, 19, carried a Rubik's Cube. Shahzada had a Nikon camera, eager to capture the view of the seafloor through Titan's single porthole.
"He was like a vibrating toddler," said Christine, who stayed on the support ship at the surface with the couple's daughter, Alina.
The two watched closely. The sun was shining. The ship was steady.
"It was a good morning," Christine Dawood said.
Soon, the Titan slinked into the water and dropped into the deep, descending toward a dream.
Later that morning, Ms. Dawood overheard someone saying that communication with Titan had been lost. The United States Coast Guard confirmed that it had happened 1 hour 45 minutes into the dive.
Ms. Dawood went to the bridge, where a team had been monitoring Titan's slow descent. She was assured that the only communication between the capsule and the ship, through coded computer text messages, was often spotty. If the break lasted more than an hour, the dive would be aborted. Titan would drop weights and come back to the surface.
For hours, Ms. Dawood slowly drowned in dread. By late afternoon, she said, someone told her that they did not know where Titan and its crew were.
"I was also looking out on the ocean, in case I could maybe see them surfacing," she said.
Four days later, with Ms. Dawood and the crew of the support ship still over the site of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials announced that they had found debris from the Titan.
They said it had most likely imploded, instantly killing everyone on board.
Besides the Dawoods, there was Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77, a French scientist and a global authority on the Titanic, trying to make his 38th dive to the wreckage. There was Hamish Harding, 58, a British airline executive, thrilled to be making his first.
And there was Stockton Rush, the 61-year-old founder and chief executive of OceanGate, which saw itself as a hybrid of science and tourism. The company declined interview requests from The New York Times.
Mr. Rush was at the controls. He wanted to be known as an innovator, someone remembered for the rules he broke.
'He Had This Big Glow on His Face'
In February, Stockton Rush and his wife, Wendy, flew to London and met with the Dawoods at a cafe near Waterloo station.
They spoke about the design and safety of the submersible and what it was like to go down in it.
"That engineering side, we just had no idea," Ms. Dawood said in an interview. "I mean, you sit in a plane without knowing how the engine works."
Shahzada Dawood was a 48-year-old British-Pakistani businessman from one of the wealthiest families in Pakistan. He was vice chairman of Engro Corporation, a business conglomerate headquartered in the port city of Karachi that is involved in agriculture, energy and telecommunications.
The Dawoods became fascinated with the Titanic after visiting an exhibition in Singapore in 2012, the 100th anniversary of the ship's sinking. Some items on display likely had been lifted to the surface by Mr. Nargeolet, they had recently come to realize.
In 2019, the family visited Greenland and was intrigued by the glaciers that sheathed into icebergs. Ms. Dawood spotted an OceanGate ad, offering trips to the Titanic. The family was sold -- especially Shahzada and Suleman. But the boy was too young to go on the dive; OceanGate required passengers to be 18, so Christine planned to accompany her husband.
The pandemic delayed all plans. Suleman was now old enough. And OceanGate waived a rule to allow the 17-year-old Alina aboard the support ship. The family wanted to experience the dive together. And Mr. Rush wanted them to be there.
Analogues to OceanGate can be found in literature, film and sometimes in real life: A pioneering scientist (or a mysterious madman, to some) offers a rare or costly glimpse of his discovery to a select few outsiders unable to resist their own curiosity.
These were not the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park or the confections of Willy Wonka. This was the opportunity to see, firsthand, through a 21-inch porthole, the world's most famous shipwreck at the bottom of the sea.
The cost was not a golden ticket, but $ 250,000, though that advertised rack rate proved negotiable.
Mr. Rush considered himself more a scientist than a salesman, but much of his effort was in the marketing of his company and the selling of spots on the submersible. He wanted a mix of clients who offered validation and buzz. Potential customers dealt directly with him.
Alan Stern, a planetary scientist from Colorado, inquired about a Titan dive last July. After Mr. Rush learned of Mr. Stern's background -- jet pilot, polar exploration, leader of NASA's New Horizon exploration of Pluto and the Kuiper belt -- he offered a free ticket. Stern accepted.
"Stockton said, 'I don't care if you give a talk -- do you want to be the co-pilot?"' he recalled. "'We'll get you trained. Get yourself to St. John's.' And that's what I ended up doing."'
Mr. Nargeolet, who went by P.H., had become a semi-permanent fixture, a quasi-member of Titanic royalty, a star and co-pilot on the OceanGate expeditions.
He spent years diving to the Titanic and collecting items for museums and exhibitions. He planned to be in Paris on July 18 for the opening of an exhibition about the Titanic.
"All my existence revolves around it," he wrote in his 2022 book, "Dans les Profondeurs du Titanic" ("In the Depths of the Titanic").
On the last expedition, Mr. Nargeolet gave a presentation about his 37 previous dives to the Titanic. He also told the group a story about how he had once been "stuck down there for three days and the sub was out of communication," Ms. Dawood recalled.
After the lecture, her husband grinned at her.
"Oh, my god, this is so cool," Ms. Dawood recalled him saying. "He was lapping everything up. He had this big glow on his face talking about all this nerdy stuff."
And so they came, these wealthy tourists and curious scientists, sold on the promise of a rare adventure provided by a company that considered itself "SpaceX for the ocean."
OceanGate spoke in the language of space travel: There was "command central," a "mission director," the "launch and recovery platform (LARS)" and a "countdown to launch."
The paying passengers were called "mission specialists," and the company requested that they not be referred to as "customers" or tourists" -- or "passengers." They were given shirts and jackets embroidered with their names and the flags of their countries. A patch on the sleeve read, "Titanic Survey Exploration Crew."
"Deep water diving in a pocket submarine is the only extreme activity accessible to anyone in good health, without training and regardless of age," Mr. Nargeolet wrote in his book.
A real-estate investor from Las Vegas named Jay Bloom wanted to go on Titan with his 20-year-old son, Sean, this year. After some back and forth, Mr. Rush in April offered the "last minute price" of $ 150,000 each -- discounting each ticket by $ 100,000. The Blooms declined, Mr. Bloom told The Times, because of scheduling issues and safety concerns.
OceanGate's plan since 2021 was to run a series of eight- or nine-day expeditions in the late spring and early summer: about two days to the Titanic site, five days over it, two days back. Each expedition might have several dives -- but just one for each client -- depending on demand, technical difficulties and weather conditions.
The final trip was Mission V. None of the first four this year got close to the Titanic, largely because of rough weather in May and early June.
"I am proud to finally announce that I joined @oceangateexped for their RMS TITANIC Mission as a mission specialist on the sub going down to the Titanic," Harding posted on his Facebook and Instagram pages the afternoon before the dive.
Harding, 58, was the chairman of Action Aviation, a sales and air operations company based in Dubai. He had previously flown to space with Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin rocket company.
Mr. Harding posted four photographs, including an image of the submersible and another one of a small white flag on which members of the expedition had signed their names in black marker.
Another photo was one of Mr. Harding, sitting with his legs crossed, smiling. He had thinning, reddish hair. He wore a black-and-green all-weather jacket unzipped over a rugby-style shirt, bluejeans, NASA-themed socks and running shoes.
In the posts, Mr. Harding detailed weather challenges but reported that the group was preparing to descend the following morning around 4.
"Until then we have a lot of preparations and briefings to do," he wrote. "More expedition updates to follow IF the weather holds!"
It was his last post.
Rocking the Boat
The OceanGate promotional video, nearly six minutes of stirring music and wide smiles, displays the balance that the company tried to cultivate.
"Get ready for what Jules Verne could only imagine," the baritone voice-over says. "This is not a thrill ride for tourists -- it's much more."
The whole enterprise made some experts queasy, including at least one former employee. Within circles of submersible experts, there were criticisms of the cylindrical design (most deepwater submersibles are spherical); the relatively large porthole (seven inches thick and made of Plexiglas, according to Mr. Rush); and the use of mixed materials, such as carbon fiber and titanium, that might not bond well or withstand the immense pressure of a deep-sea dive.
In 2018, Will Kohnen, chair of the Marine Technology Society's manned underwater vehicles committee, drafted a letter to Mr. Rush, saying that OceanGate's "experimental" approach could lead to "catastrophic" consequences. It was signed by dozens of experts.
The next year, a submersible expert heard cracking sounds during a Titan dive in the Bahamas and, in an email to Mr. Rush, begged him to suspend operations. Mr. Rush made some revisions but kept taking customers.
Bill Price, retired from running a family travel business in California, went on a Titan dive in 2021. During the descent, Mr. Rush realized that Titan had lost its propulsion system on one side. He aborted the trip, Mr. Price said.
But he could not get what he called the "drop-weight mechanism" to release ballast for the ascent, as designed, Mr. Price said. (In a video interview with Alan Estrada, a Mexican social media influencer, Mr. Rush explained the ballast system, which included six 24-inch sewer pipes that weighed 37 pounds, "and we dump that pipe, one by one.")
Mr. Rush calmly explained that the weights were loaded from the top with no stopper -- so if they could rock the submersible enough, they would drop off.
Everyone lined up in a row, rushed to one side, then the other, back and forth, to tip the Titan and dislodge the ballast, the way someone might rock a vending machine to free a candy bar stuck on a spindle.
"After several rolls, we got momentum going," Mr. Price said. "Then, we heard a clunk, and we all collectively knew one had dropped off. So we continued to do that, until the weights were all out."
None of this prevented Titan from making a dive the next day, with Mr. Price aboard. They saw the Titanic and celebrated at the surface with sparkling cider.
"The fact that we went through that, we experienced some worst-case scenarios, and we overcame it, my thinking was, 'We can do this,"' Mr. Price said.
The OceanGate pitch, without any guarantees, was that Titan would take about two and a half hours to drop to the Titanic and about two and a half hours to ascend back to the surface. In between would be about four hours of touring the wreckage.
Most of the trips did not end with up-close views of the Titanic. More Titan missions were aborted than accomplished.
Yet Mr. Rush had a way of instilling confidence in passengers with good-natured transparency, even as issues arose. After a planned test dive was scrubbed a few weeks ago because a balky computer connection had made the Titan hard to control, Mr. Rush gathered everyone for a debriefing.
"To put it bluntly, that's why I called it -- mostly because we've got to find out what this control problem is," he said in a conversation captured by a YouTuber who was on the expedition. "That's sort of important, controlling the sub."
Mr. Stern, the planetary scientist with a background in aeronautics, said that he had not known about some of the concerns that had come to light since the accident, like the letter from the submersible experts.
He returned safely from the expedition, impressed by the protocols.
"I fully recognized that implosion could be the way that our dive ended," Mr. Stern said. "My own estimation was that Titan had dived dozens of times -- not all of them to the Titanic -- and for me, that was an empirical indication that they were running a pretty reliable, safe operation."
Mr. Price recalled some of the analogies he had heard used onboard to explain what it would be like to be crushed by extreme pressure in the deep ocean. One was that of a Coke can smashed with a sledgehammer. Another was an elephant standing on one foot, with 100 more elephants on top of it.
Death would be instantaneous.
"In a macabre way," Mr. Price said, "it was reassuring."
On the Polar Prince
All of the expeditions began in St. John's, Newfoundland, on the eastern edge of the North American continent, tucked deep into the claw of a narrow harbor.
The Dawoods flew to Toronto on June 14. A canceled flight to St. John's gave them time to explore the city, but when the next day's flight was delayed, they feared they would miss the Titanic trip completely.
"We were actually quite worried, like, oh my god, what if they cancel that flight as well?" Ms. Dawood said. "In hindsight, obviously, I wish they did."
They arrived in the middle of the night and went straight to the Polar Prince, a former Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker and buoy tender that was built in 1959 and used by OceanGate this year.
It had a deep-blue hull and a crew of 17. It also housed and ferried about two dozen OceanGate divers and staff members, plus a revolving set of clients. This spring, it was seen going in and out of the harbor towing a floating platform, about 20 feet square, on which the 20,000-pound Titan submersible rode.
The Dawoods found the cabins tight. The husband and wife slept in bunk beds, she on top. The kids each got their own cabin. Meals were eaten together, everyone on the ship, in the galley, buffet-style and on trays.
There were all-hands meeting every day at 7 a.m., and again at 7 p.m., lasting an hour or more. What did we learn, what are we going to do, what do we need to think about?
Among the safety procedures were what Mr. Rush called "stopskis." They were five-minute pauses to break the momentum of the mission at key points and let people ponder and voice concerns.
Part of the idea was to keep the paying customers -- the "explorers, adventurers, and citizen scientists" -- from being passive participants.
"Mission Specialists receive training in a variety of roles such as submersible navigation and piloting, tracking and communications, and submersible maintenance and operations," the OceanGate brochure read. "They make one submersible dive and assist on the surface when other teams dive."
At night, there was usually a presentation from Mr. Rush, Mr. Nargeolet or one of the other scientists, including the clients that Rush had brought aboard, from archaeologists to astronauts. People sat on the floor or on couches to listen. Sometimes they watched "Titanic."
Into the Deep
The divers had to be on deck by 5 a.m. It was Sunday, June 18.
The briefing discussed the plan and responsibilities. The mood was serious. The ship was buzzing. Divers and the submersible crew made last-minute preparations in the water.
"It was like a well-oiled operation -- you could see they had done this before many times," Ms. Dawood said.
By then, the three first-time divers had been told what to expect and how to prepare for the expected 12-hour trip.
Mr. Rush always recommended a "low-residue diet" the day before a dive, and no coffee the morning of one. Relieving yourself over the planned 12 hours meant steady aim into a bottle or a camp-style toilet behind a curtain.
Wear thick socks and bring a beanie because it will get chillier the deeper we go. Try not to get your feet wet from the condensation that pools on the floor.
Don't expect to see anything through the porthole or the exterior cameras on the way down because the floodlights will be turned off to save battery power for the epic tour on the ocean floor -- though there was a chance to catch glimpses of bioluminescent creatures, creating a sensation like falling through stars.
The dim lights inside were kept off for the same reason. The only glow would come from computer screens and light-up pens used to track the descent on paper.
And, Mr. Rush would ask, please load some of your favorite songs into your phone to share with others to play on a Bluetooth speaker. But please, he would add: No country music.
The divers of June 18 were told to be ready to board by 7:30. Suleman and Shahzada had their OceanGate flight suits as well as waterproof trousers, an orange waterproof jacket, steel-toed boots, life vests and helmets.
They stopped to be weighed, as required.
"I'm looking quite fat," Ms. Dawood recalled her husband's saying. "I'm boiling up already."
Suleman went down the stairs to get into the motorized raft that would shuttle the passengers to the floating platform on which Titan was tied. Shahzada was less graceful.
"He needed an extra hand to go down the stairs in all this gear because the boots were very clunky," she said. "And Alina and I were like, 'Oh, God, I hope that he doesn't fall into the water."
The divers were specks out on the platform. Soon, they disappeared into the Titan.
Getting into the submersible was a bit like crawling through the back hatch of an S.U.V. with no seats. There was a rubber mat on the floor and two handles on the ceiling to hang onto.
Rush, the pilot, usually sat at the back, away from the porthole. Others sat with their backs to the curved walls. Past passengers had sometimes sat on a padded seat cushion like those you might bring to a stadium.
Divers closed the hatch. Someone with a ratchet tightened all the bolts.
Eventually, crews maneuvered the Titan underwater and released it from the platform.
The Titan typically descended at about 25 meters per minute, or roughly one mile per hour. It was slow enough that there was no sense of motion.
Inside, the glow of daylight overhead would have slowly dimmed. Within a few minutes, Titan would be absorbed in darkness, and the porthole would be a ring of black.

At a Sonic Sphere, Trying to Step Up: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: A hanging concert hall at the Shed in Manhattan purports to offer something "experimental, experiential and communal." Our critic climbs the stairs.
"Whoa," a man near me said as the curtains swept open.
He, I and a couple of hundred other people had been waiting in a large room at the Shed, the arts center at Hudson Yards in Manhattan. Portentous, woozy background music was playing, as if an alien encounter was imminent.
Then those curtains parted, and a much larger room was revealed: the Shed's vast McCourt space, in which a sphere, 65 feet in diameter and pocked like Swiss cheese, had been suspended from the faraway ceiling and bathed in red light.
This arresting -- indeed, "whoa"-inducing -- sight was the Sonic Sphere, a realization of a concert hall design by the brilliant, peerlessly loopy composer Karlheinz Stockhausen (1928-2007), who inspired Germany to build the first one for the 1970 World Exposition in Osaka, Japan.
Stockhausen, an impresario of electroacoustic experimentation and far-out notions like a string quartet playing inside a helicopter, imagined the audiences for his "Kugelauditorium" sitting on a sound-permeable level within the sphere, so that speakers could be placed under, as well as around and over, them.
During the six months that the Osaka exposition was open, hundreds of thousands of people came and heard taped music adapted for the in-the-round playback possibilities, as well as live performances. Then, for the next half century, the idea lay dormant; Carnegie Hall and Vienna's Musikverein remained intact, having not been replaced by giant spheres.
Enter, a few years ago, a team led by Ed Cooke (whose biography calls him "a multidisciplinary explorer of consciousness"), the sound designer Merijn Royaards and Nicholas Christie, the project's engineering director.
They have built Sonic Spheres in France, Britain, Mexico and the United States. Each time, like the plant in "Little Shop of Horrors," the contraption has grown. The Shed iteration, open through the end of July, is the first to hang in midair, at a cost of more than $ 2 million.
As in Osaka, some of the presentations offer taped music; some, live. On Saturday, I climbed the many steps to the sphere's entrance and reclined, like everyone else, in a comfortable hammock-like seat, listening to the seductively sullen 2009 debut album by the British band the xx. Forty-five minutes after that was over, the pianist Igor Levit appeared in person to perform, for a fresh audience, Morton Feldman's "Palais de Mari," from 1986.
Lights, in colors and configurations that tended to shift with the music's beat, played on the fabric skin of this big Wiffle ball. But for an audience that could be seeing the high-definition stadium shows of Beyoncé or Taylor Swift this summer, the visuals were blurry, rudimentary stuff; this was the aspect of the presentation that felt most trapped in 1970.
And the audio experience that emerged from the 124 speakers was unremarkable at best. The xx remix did nicely separate the bass, coming up palpably but not too heavily out of the bottom of the sphere, from the voices around and above. To no compelling end, though, and the album's whispery intimacy was supersized into a much blander grandeur.
The situation was more distressing for Levit. While the spare, spacious chords of "Palais de Mari" registered more or less cleanly, with only slight fuzz, the sound was muddy for the Bach chorale he played as a prelude; it was the perennial challenge of amplifying acoustic instruments, times 124. And the jittery lighting, a collaboration between Levit and the artist Rirkrit Tiravanija, could hardly have been more uncomprehending of Feldman's glacial austerity.
For all the souped-up spiffiness of the Sonic Sphere, the programming on Saturday felt like a retread of artists who were more interesting when Alex Poots, the Shed's artistic director, presented them during his stint at the Park Avenue Armory uptown.
There, in 2014, the xx did a celebrated (live) residency in front of only a few dozen people per show. Levit, the following year, played Bach as part of an ornate concentration exercise orchestrated by Marina Abramovic. (Will he, now a fixture of New York's more unconventional spaces, end up hanging upside-down at the piano once the Perelman Performing Arts Center opens this fall?)
Those Armory shows were more memorable than either Shed set. Both of them on Saturday were under 40 minutes, but I found myself getting antsy well before time was up. Perhaps the audiences at Burning Man, the techno-hippie hedonist bonanza in the Nevada desert where a Sonic Sphere was built last year, were more engrossed, experiencing it on harder drugs than the Coke Zero I'd had with dinner.
Sober, none of the music was more interesting, effective, illuminated or illuminating in this space than it would have been elsewhere. It was clear that the main point was that first reveal, as the curtains opened and everyone's phones came out, ready to post images of something big and glamorous on social media.
So, millions of dollars for Instagram bait -- but fine, if its creators didn't also hype it as "an unlimited instrument of empathy" that's "experimental, experiential and communal." I felt, in fact, more distant from my fellow audience members in the Sonic Sphere, even the ones reclining next to me, than I have at most any traditional concert hall.
In this, the sphere is of a piece with the other current offering at the Shed: a weird virtual-reality simulacrum of a solo piano concert by the composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, who died in March.
Empathy? Communal experience? No, the hologram-like specter of Sakamoto was more vivid and substantial than the other people watching with me, who, while I wore the VR glasses, faded into transparent ghostliness.
The wall text in the holding room for the Sonic Sphere acknowledges that technology can isolate us from each other, but adds that mustn't necessarily be the case: "We need it to delight and inspire us, not just passively, but in ways that provoke action."
But, as with so much ambitious, empty-headed, underwhelming, ultimately depressing tech, the action that's provoked by this expensive spectacle is merely a passing moment of "whoa."

A Rubik’s Cube, Thick Socks and Giddy Anticipation: The Last Hours of the Titan

The last time Christine Dawood saw her husband, Shahzada Dawood, and their son, Suleman Dawood, they were specks on the North Atlantic, bobbing on a floating platform about 400 miles from land. It was Father’s Day, June 18, and she watched from the support ship as they climbed into a 22-foot submersible craft called Titan.
Divers closed them inside by tightening a ring of bolts as the craft rolled on the waves about 13,000 feet above the 111-year-old wreckage of the Titanic.
Suleman Dawood, 19, carried a Rubik’s Cube. Shahzada Dawood had a Nikon camera, eager to capture the view of the seafloor through Titan’s single porthole.
“He was like a vibrating toddler,” said Christine Dawood, who stayed on the support ship at the surface with the couple’s daughter, Alina Dawood.
The two watched closely. The sun was shining. The ship was steady.
“It was a good morning,” Christine Dawood said.
Soon, the Titan slinked into the water and dropped into the deep, descending toward a dream.
Later that morning, Dawood overheard someone saying that communication with Titan had been lost. The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed that it had happened 1 hour 45 minutes into the dive.
Dawood went to the bridge, where a team had been monitoring Titan’s slow descent. She was assured that the only communication between the capsule and the ship, through coded computer text messages, was often spotty. If the break lasted more than an hour, the dive would be aborted. Titan would drop weights and come back to the surface.
For hours, Dawood slowly drowned in dread. By late afternoon, she said, someone told her that they did not know where Titan and its crew were.
“I was also looking out on the ocean, in case I could maybe see them surfacing,” she said.
Four days later, with Dawood and the crew of the support ship still over the site of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials announced that they had found debris from the Titan.
They said it had most likely imploded, instantly killing everyone on board.
Besides the Dawoods, there was Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77, a French scientist and a global authority on the Titanic, trying to make his 38th dive to the wreckage. There was Hamish Harding, 58, a British airline executive, thrilled to be making his first.
And there was Stockton Rush, the 61-year-old founder and CEO of OceanGate, which saw itself as a hybrid of science and tourism. The company declined interview requests from The New York Times.
Rush was at the controls. He wanted to be known as an innovator, someone remembered for the rules he broke.
‘He Had This Big Glow on His Face’
In February, Stockton Rush and his wife, Wendy, flew to London and met with the Dawoods at a cafe near Waterloo station.
They spoke about the design and safety of the submersible and what it was like to go down in it.
“That engineering side, we just had no idea,” Christine Dawood said in an interview. “I mean, you sit in a plane without knowing how the engine works.”
Shahzada Dawood was a 48-year-old British Pakistani business owner from one of the wealthiest families in Pakistan. He was vice chair of Engro Corp., a business conglomerate headquartered in the port city of Karachi, Pakistan, that is involved in agriculture, energy and telecommunications.
The Dawoods became fascinated with the Titanic after visiting an exhibition in Singapore in 2012, the 100th anniversary of the ship’s sinking. Some items on display likely had been lifted to the surface by Nargeolet, they had recently come to realize.
In 2019, the family visited Greenland and was intrigued by the glaciers that sheathed into icebergs. Christine Dawood spotted an OceanGate ad, offering trips to the Titanic. The family was sold — especially father and son. But the boy was too young to go on the dive; OceanGate required passengers to be 18, so Dawood planned to accompany her husband.
The pandemic delayed all plans. Suleman Dawood was now old enough. And OceanGate waived a rule to allow the 17-year-old Alina Dawood aboard the support ship. The family wanted to experience the dive together. And Stockton Rush wanted them to be there.
Analogues to OceanGate can be found in literature, film and sometimes in real life: A pioneering scientist (or a mysterious madman, to some) offers a rare or costly glimpse of his discovery to a select few outsiders unable to resist their own curiosity.
These were not the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park or the confections of Willy Wonka. This was the opportunity to see, firsthand, through a 21-inch porthole, the world’s most famous shipwreck at the bottom of the sea.
The cost was not a golden ticket, but $250,000, though that advertised rack rate proved negotiable.
Rush considered himself more a scientist than a salesman, but much of his effort was in the marketing of his company and the selling of spots on the submersible. He wanted a mix of clients who offered validation and buzz. Potential customers dealt directly with him.
Alan Stern, a planetary scientist from Colorado, inquired about a Titan dive last July. After Rush learned of Stern’s background — jet pilot, polar exploration, leader of NASA’s New Horizon exploration of Pluto and the Kuiper belt — he offered a free ticket. Stern accepted.
“Stockton said, ‘I don’t care if you give a talk — do you want to be the co-pilot?’” he recalled. “‘We’ll get you trained. Get yourself to St. John’s.’ And that’s what I ended up doing.’”
Nargeolet, who went by P.H., had become a semi-permanent fixture, a quasi-member of Titanic royalty, a star and co-pilot on the OceanGate expeditions.
He spent years diving to the Titanic and collecting items for museums and exhibitions. He planned to be in Paris on July 18 for the opening of an exhibition about the Titanic.
“All my existence revolves around it,” he wrote in his 2022 book, “Dans les Profondeurs du Titanic” (“In the Depths of the Titanic”).
On the last expedition, Nargeolet gave a presentation about his 37 previous dives to the Titanic. He also told the group a story about how he had once been “stuck down there for three days and the sub was out of communication,” Christine Dawood recalled.
After the lecture, her husband grinned at her.
“Oh, my God, this is so cool,” Christine Dawood recalled him saying.
“He was lapping everything up,” she added. “He had this big glow on his face talking about all this nerdy stuff.”
And so they came, these wealthy tourists and curious scientists, sold on the promise of a rare adventure provided by a company that considered itself “SpaceX for the ocean.”
OceanGate spoke in the language of space travel: There was “command central,” a “mission director,” the “launch and recovery platform (LARS)” and a “countdown to launch.”
The paying passengers were called “mission specialists,” and the company requested that they not be referred to as “customers” or tourists” — or “passengers.” They were given shirts and jackets embroidered with their names and the flags of their countries. A patch on the sleeve read, “Titanic Survey Exploration Crew.”
“Deep water diving in a pocket submarine is the only extreme activity accessible to anyone in good health, without training and regardless of age,” Nargeolet wrote in his book.
A real estate investor from Las Vegas named Jay Bloom wanted to go on Titan with his 20-year-old son, Sean, this year. After some back and forth, Rush in April offered the “last minute price” of $150,000 each — discounting each ticket by $100,000. The Blooms declined, Bloom told the Times, because of scheduling issues and safety concerns.
OceanGate’s plan since 2021 was to run a series of eight- or nine-day expeditions in the late spring and early summer: about two days to the Titanic site, five days over it, two days back. Each expedition might have several dives — but just one for each client — depending on demand, technical difficulties and weather conditions.
The final trip was Mission V. None of the first four this year got close to the Titanic, largely because of rough weather in May and early June.
“I am proud to finally announce that I joined @oceangateexped for their RMS TITANIC Mission as a mission specialist on the sub going down to the Titanic,” Harding posted on his Facebook and Instagram pages the afternoon before the dive.
Harding, 58, was the chair of Action Aviation, a sales and air operations company based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. He had previously flown to space with Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin rocket company.
Harding posted four photographs, including an image of the submersible and another one of a small white flag on which members of the expedition had signed their names in black marker.
Another photo was one of Harding, sitting with his legs crossed, smiling. He had thinning, reddish hair. He wore a black-and-green all-weather jacket unzipped over a rugby-style shirt, bluejeans, NASA-themed socks and running shoes.
In the posts, Harding detailed weather challenges but reported that the group was preparing to descend the following morning around 4.
“Until then we have a lot of preparations and briefings to do,” he wrote. “More expedition updates to follow IF the weather holds!”
It was his last post.
Rocking the Boat
The OceanGate promotional video, nearly six minutes of stirring music and wide smiles, displays the balance that the company tried to cultivate.
“Get ready for what Jules Verne could only imagine,” the baritone voice-over says. “This is not a thrill ride for tourists — it’s much more.”
The whole enterprise made some experts queasy, including at least one former employee. Within circles of submersible experts, there were criticisms of the cylindrical design (most deep-water submersibles are spherical); the relatively large porthole (7 inches thick and made of Plexiglas, according to Rush); and the use of mixed materials, such as carbon fiber and titanium, that might not bond well or withstand the immense pressure of a deep-sea dive.
In 2018, Will Kohnen, chair of the Marine Technology Society’s manned underwater vehicles committee, drafted a letter to Rush, saying that OceanGate’s “experimental” approach could lead to “catastrophic” consequences. It was signed by dozens of experts.
The next year, a submersible expert heard cracking sounds during a Titan dive in the Bahamas and, in an email to Rush, begged him to suspend operations. Rush made some revisions but kept taking customers.
Bill Price, retired from running a family travel business in California, went on a Titan dive in 2021. During the descent, Rush realized that Titan had lost its propulsion system on one side. He aborted the trip, Price said.
But he could not get what he called the “drop-weight mechanism” to release ballast for the ascent, as designed, Price said. (In a video interview with Alan Estrada, a Mexican social media influencer, Rush explained the ballast system, which included six 24-inch sewer pipes that weighed 37 pounds, “and we dump that pipe, one by one.”)
Rush calmly explained that the weights were loaded from the top with no stopper — so if they could rock the submersible enough, they would drop off.
Everyone lined up in a row, rushed to one side, then the other, back and forth, to tip the Titan and dislodge the ballast, the way someone might rock a vending machine to free a candy bar stuck on a spindle.
“After several rolls, we got momentum going,” Price said. “Then, we heard a clunk, and we all collectively knew one had dropped off. So we continued to do that, until the weights were all out.”
None of this prevented Titan from making a dive the next day, with Price aboard. They saw the Titanic and celebrated at the surface with sparkling cider.
“The fact that we went through that, we experienced some worst-case scenarios, and we overcame it, my thinking was, ‘We can do this,’” Price said.
The OceanGate pitch, without any guarantees, was that Titan would take about 2 1/2 hours to drop to the Titanic and about 2 1/2 hours to ascend back to the surface. In between would be about four hours of touring the wreckage.
Most of the trips did not end with up-close views of the Titanic. More Titan missions were aborted than accomplished.
Yet Rush had a way of instilling confidence in passengers with good-natured transparency, even as issues arose. After a planned test dive was scrubbed a few weeks ago because a balky computer connection had made the Titan hard to control, Rush gathered everyone for a debriefing.
“To put it bluntly, that’s why I called it — mostly because we’ve got to find out what this control problem is,” he said in a conversation captured by a YouTuber who was on the expedition. “That’s sort of important, controlling the sub.”
Stern, the planetary scientist with a background in aeronautics, said that he had not known about some of the concerns that had come to light since the accident, like the letter from the submersible experts.
He returned safely from the expedition, impressed by the protocols.
“I fully recognized that implosion could be the way that our dive ended,” Stern said. “My own estimation was that Titan had dived dozens of times — not all of them to the Titanic — and for me, that was an empirical indication that they were running a pretty reliable, safe operation.”
Price recalled some of the analogies he had heard used onboard to explain what it would be like to be crushed by extreme pressure in the deep ocean. One was that of a Coke can smashed with a sledgehammer. Another was an elephant standing on one foot, with 100 more elephants on top of it.
Death would be instantaneous.
“In a macabre way,” Price said, “it was reassuring.”
On the Polar Prince
All of the expeditions began in St. John’s, Newfoundland, on the eastern edge of the North American continent, tucked deep into the claw of a narrow harbor.
The Dawoods flew to Toronto on June 14. A canceled flight to St. John’s gave them time to explore the city, but when the next day’s flight was delayed, they feared they would miss the Titanic trip completely.
“We were actually quite worried, like, oh my God, what if they cancel that flight as well?” Christine Dawood said. “In hindsight, obviously, I wish they did.”
They arrived in the middle of the night and went straight to the Polar Prince, a former Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker and buoy tender that was built in 1959 and used by OceanGate this year.
It had a deep-blue hull and a crew of 17. It also housed and ferried about two dozen OceanGate divers and staff members, plus a revolving set of clients. This spring, it was seen going in and out of the harbor towing a floating platform, about 20 feet square, on which the 20,000-pound Titan submersible rode.
The Dawoods found the cabins tight. The husband and wife slept in bunk beds, she on top. The kids each got their own cabin. Meals were eaten together, everyone on the ship, in the galley, buffet-style and on trays.
There were all-hands meetings every day at 7 a.m., and again at 7 p.m., lasting an hour or more. What did we learn, what are we going to do, what do we need to think about?
Among the safety procedures were what Rush called “stopskis.” They were five-minute pauses to break the momentum of the mission at key points and let people ponder and voice concerns.
Part of the idea was to keep the paying customers — the “explorers, adventurers and citizen scientists” — from being passive participants.
“Mission Specialists receive training in a variety of roles such as submersible navigation and piloting, tracking and communications, and submersible maintenance and operations,” the OceanGate brochure read. “They make one submersible dive and assist on the surface when other teams dive.”
At night, there was usually a presentation from Rush, Nargeolet or one of the other scientists, including the clients that Rush had brought aboard, from archaeologists to astronauts. People sat on the floor or on couches to listen. Sometimes they watched “Titanic.”
Into the Deep
The divers had to be on deck by 5 a.m. It was Sunday, June 18.
The briefing discussed the plan and responsibilities. The mood was serious. The ship was buzzing. Divers and the submersible crew made last-minute preparations in the water.
“It was like a well-oiled operation — you could see they had done this before many times,” Dawood said.
By then, the three first-time divers had been told what to expect and how to prepare for the expected 12-hour trip.
Rush always recommended a “low-residue diet” the day before a dive, and no coffee the morning of one. Relieving yourself over the planned 12 hours meant steady aim into a bottle or a camp-style toilet behind a curtain.
Wear thick socks and bring a beanie because it will get chillier the deeper we go. Try not to get your feet wet from the condensation that pools on the floor.
Don’t expect to see anything through the porthole or the exterior cameras on the way down because the floodlights will be turned off to save battery power for the epic tour on the ocean floor — though there was a chance to catch glimpses of bioluminescent creatures, creating a sensation like falling through stars.
The dim lights inside were kept off for the same reason. The only glow would come from computer screens and light-up pens used to track the descent on paper.
And, Rush would ask, please load some of your favorite songs into your phone to share with others to play on a Bluetooth speaker. But please, he would add: No country music.
The divers of June 18 were told to be ready to board by 7:30. Suleman and Shahzada Dawood had their OceanGate flight suits as well as waterproof trousers, an orange waterproof jacket, steel-toed boots, life vests and helmets.
They stopped to be weighed, as required.
“I’m looking quite fat,” Christine Dawood recalled her husband saying. “I’m boiling up already.”
Suleman Dawood went down the stairs to get into the motorized raft that would shuttle the passengers to the floating platform on which Titan was tied. Shahzada Dawood was less graceful.
“He needed an extra hand to go down the stairs in all this gear because the boots were very clunky,” she said. “And Alina and I were like, ‘Oh, God, I hope that he doesn’t fall into the water.”
The divers were specks out on the platform. Soon, they disappeared into the Titan.
Getting into the submersible was a bit like crawling through the back hatch of an SUV with no seats. There was a rubber mat on the floor and two handles on the ceiling to hang onto.
Rush, the pilot, usually sat at the back, away from the porthole. Others sat with their backs to the curved walls. Past passengers had sometimes sat on a padded seat cushion like those you might bring to a stadium.
Divers closed the hatch. Someone with a ratchet tightened all the bolts.
Eventually, crews maneuvered the Titan underwater and released it from the platform.
The Titan typically descended at about 25 meters per minute, or roughly 1 mph. It was slow enough that there was no sense of motion.
Inside, the glow of daylight overhead would have slowly dimmed. Within a few minutes, Titan would be absorbed in darkness, and the porthole would be a ring of black.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The seven-bedroom house also has garages for five cars, a game room and a wine cellar, but the rapper is ready to move on and diversify his real estate portfolio.
Karim Kharbouch, better known by his stage name French Montana, is bidding adieu to his 1.35-acre compound in Los Angeles's exclusive Hidden Hills neighborhood, asking $ 22.75 million for the seven-bedroom, nine-bath home in one of the city's most celebrity-studded communities.
The Moroccan-born rapper bought the home in late 2020 from the basketball player Paul George, an all-star forward for the Los Angeles Clippers. He paid $ 8.4 million, which was something of a bargain: Mr. George had initially asked $ 9.5 million for the property, which is tucked behind gates on grounds that include a full-size basketball court, a fire pit, pool and spa with stone decking, and garages for five cars, and was willing to take the $ 1 million price cut after the property languished on the market for six months.
The current listing is quite a price jump, but the luxury real estate agent Tomer Fridman, who is representing Mr. Montana through Compass's The Fridman Group, said considering the estate's massive footprint of nearly 16,000 square feet, it's right in line with Hidden Hills prices.
"It's not only about the size of the house, it's also the grounds, " said Mr. Fridman, whose other clients include the Kardashian-Jenner clan, Britney Spears and Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne. "You've got over an acre. You've got a sports court and a spa in the guesthouse down below. There's everything you need for the California lifestyle."
The median price per square foot in Hidden Hills is currently $ 1,365 per square foot, according to movoto.com.
Mr. Montana, 38, is the founder of Coke Boys Records, previously known as Cocaine City Records. He was born in Casablanca and moved with his family to the South Bronx when he was 13. He got his start as a battle rapper, and in 2012 signed with Sean Combs's Bad Boy Records and Rick Ross's Maybach Music Group. His 2017 hit, the diamond single "Unforgettable," reached the No. 1 slot on Billboard's Hot Rap songs chart.
This is the second home Mr. Montana has sold in Hidden Hills: In 2021 he sold an 8,600-square-foot mansion with a resort-style backyard for $ 5 million. He purchased that home, in the 11-house gated community of Mureau Estates, from the pop star Selena Gomez in 2016, and later added a $ 400,000 custom recording studio.
Mr. Montana is choosing to sell again, said Mr. Fridman, because he is now looking to take his real estate portfolio global.
"He's looking for something new in Miami, maybe something else in Los Angeles, something probably in New York, and then also overseas, probably in Paris," said Mr. Fridman. "He's diversifying. This is a big house."
So big, in fact, that its great room alone is a gargantuan 4,000 square feet, with high ceilings, motorized skylights and sliding glass walls offering sweeping views of the property's grounds.
"Hidden Hills normally does not have views. But this property does have views," Mr. Fridman said.
There's also a breakfast room with a fireplace off the chef's kitchen as well as a formal dining room with high-beam ceilings; a game room, home theater, gym (with steam shower) and a walk-in wine cellar. In the primary suite, Mr. Montana has a two-sided fireplace and two massive walk-in closets; the primary suite's bathroom features an all-stone bath with a built-in sofa.
"L.A. homes need to have certain programming, and that indoor-outdoor flow is so important," said Mr. Fridman. "This is how we live in L.A. and the house works so well for the L.A. lifestyle."

IV Drips for When You 'Can't Be Down for a Day': [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: High-powered revelers are trying to hack their hangovers with concierge infusions.
Some go for Alka-Seltzer. Others, Pedialyte. Anthony Bourdain had a recipe: aspirin, a cold Coca-Cola, Sichuan food and a joint.
But in recent years, some hungover people with cash to spare have been paying for an intravenous drip at a location of their choosing. Most IV drips are packed with a combination of saline, vitamins, headache relief and anti-nausea medications.
It's a cocktail after cocktails. A flush, for the flush.
"I can't be down a day. I can't miss a day of work and just stay home and do nothing and feel bad for myself," said Gabriel Boxer, 42, who said he learned about the hangover drips from an episode of "Billions."
By day, Mr. Boxer works for a financial technology company. But by night he's the "Kosher Guru," a Jewish lifestyle influencer. After a big event, he'll make an appointment for a nurse to come to his workplace. He catches up on emails with a needle in his arm.
"I can't say I walk around the office saying that I have a hangover," Mr. Boxer said, in between laughs. "I frame it as my self-care."
The IV drips started drawing attention about 10 years ago and seemed to signal a new phase of partying, as binge drinking crashed into the wellness industry.
In the past few years, the hangover-cures industry has boomed, despite the skepticism of many researchers who say there is little or no evidence behind the grand claims.
Some concierge IV companies have expanded from hangovers to wellness. Clean Market, a medical spa whose NutriDrip came on the market through its Hangover Club about a decade ago, now offers cryotherapy, lymphatic drainage and infrared sauna therapy.
"When we started, it was probably 75 percent hangover driven," said Asa Kitfield, a founder of Clean Market. The company's Las Vegas location is still hangover focused, he said, but in New York, he said, 80 percent of its IV drips are about wellness.
Some regular users compared the drips to a post-marathon massage. Companies and influencers pitch them as virtuous aftercare. The marketing builds off a national obsession with staying hydrated and detoxing, and also nods to an online "biohack" conversation, a body-as-machine approach to physical enhancement.
"It's like the bottle service of the recovery world," said Danielle Remington, the director of events and partnerships for Drip Hydration, a concierge IV company. "It's almost like having a private chef."
Many of the basic drips start at about $ 150 to $ 300. Most companies offer the option to include additional vitamins and minerals, each for a cost. With add-ons, a drip can cost more than $ 1,000. Few, if any, drips are covered by health insurance.
The expense may be part of the appeal. Influencers post about their IV bags just hours after they show off V.I.P. passes. Status symbols compound in the conspicuous consumption of fun.
"Getting an IV at home after a hangover is like a flex," said Dr. Abe Malkin, the chief executive and founder of Drip Hydration. "It's like, 'Look at me. I'm pretty bougie. I don't need to sit and suffer."'
Many users see the drips as an add-on to a weekend splurge, especially in party destinations. Hangover Heaven, for instance, is based in Las Vegas. Other IV companies send teams to big music festivals, like Coachella. In Miami, Lupo Yachts, a charter luxury tour company, offers a suggestion for an IV drip company to groups. About one in 20 go for it, said Michael Lupolover, the owner and founder.
Some bachelorette parties hire teams of nurses to go from one elbow to another. One hungover bride even got a drip while she sat for hair and makeup. (Her groom sent the nurse over to her after his drip had been set up.)
"They were like, 'I'm struggling. I'm getting married in three hours,"' said Rob McAdams, 32, a nurse at NutriDrip who treated the couple. "I was like, 'OK. Let's do this. Let's fix you."'
Hospitals use IV drips regularly to hydrate patients, said Dr. Ali Raja, the deputy chair of emergency medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. "There really aren't risks," he said.
But there may not be many benefits, either. Dr. Raja said that there was only limited scientific research into the treatments. Most people recover from a hangover with time and water, he said, so users are paying for an expedited recovery.
"It's like taking an Uber Black versus a shared Uber," Dr. Raja said. "It'll get you to the same place, but maybe a lot more quickly."
This sort of personalized care has stretched into many medical specialties, including orthodontics and general practice. After testing themselves for Covid at home, people are injecting themselves with weight loss drugs or getting Adderall prescribed via telehealth. The services are often tailored, expensive and largely outside of the traditional medical establishment.
"It is coinciding with this idea of a deeper understanding of our personal biology," said Emily Moquin, a food and beverage analyst at Morning Consult, a research firm.
Justin Jamieson, a 52-year-old journalist, traveled from Australia to Las Vegas to report on the IV drips.
Mr. Jamieson and his wife started drinking cocktails around midday. Then, they switched to beer and whiskey. At 5 p.m., they got foot massages -- and fell asleep. ("By that time," he said, "we were pretty trolleyed.")
When they woke up, they had martinis, then split a bottle of wine for dinner. But it wasn't enough.
"There was no point flying for 16, 17 hours to get to Las Vegas to test somebody out and just have a few beers," he said. "I needed to really destroy myself."
So at their hotel, Mr. Jamieson said, he explained his plan to the bartender. He drank several beers, along with four shots of "that cinnamon whiskey." (He meant Fireball.)
The next day, he said, "I felt like a truck had driven over my head." But after an IV drip, he felt good enough to sky-dive off a skyscraper that afternoon.

Full text: Beaded and bedazzled, fancy and frilly, lacy and Lycra-fitted -- bridal bikinis are here. Brides are embracing swimwear for after parties, honeymoons and even ceremonies.
Marigo Mihalos Sfaelos brought many outfits to her four-day, event-filled wedding in Karpathos, Greece, last year. There was the silk citrine Greek goddess-style dress, a floral appliqué Estee Couture bridal gown, and a disco ball-inspired floor-length dress for the after party. But the showstopper was worn at the post-wedding beach party: a gladiator-like metal and silver bikini with rhinestones, from the designer Karen Sabag's Rêver collection, along with a matching overlay skirt.
"I wanted it to be a bridal look that stood out, and the bride should stand out," said Mrs. Mihalos Sfaelos, 35, a senior director of talent relations at SiriusXM radio in New York. She married Spiro Sfaelos, a 37-year-old restaurant owner, atop a cliff on Aug. 27, 2022, on the Greek island where she grew up. "You can't just wear a white bathing suit."
Other brides seem to feel the same way, especially with destination weddings, and designers and stylists are paying close attention. Today's bridal swimwear are not just fashion-forward white bathing suits -- they are beaded and bedazzled, fancy and frilly, lacy and Lycra-fitted, and custom made.
Mrs. Mihalos Sfaelos said her bathing suit felt bridal.
"Like a bridal dress, it was a full statement," said Mrs. Mihalos Sfaelos, who lives in Clifton, N.J. "It was a one-of-a-kind, custom-made item tailored to my body."
Like a wedding gown, Ms. Sabag, who also made Mrs. Mihalos Sfaelos's second wedding dress, took measurements and did two fittings.
"As much attention to the wedding dress was paid to this bathing suit," Mrs. Mihalos Sfaelos added.
Samantha Brown, a professional stylist in New York, sees bridal swimwear as a trend that's likely here to stay. "We used to see brides wearing gigantic gowns on the beach, which never made any sense," she said. "They were heavy, dragging through the sand and out of place for the venue. Now, people are trying to find unique touch points that make their wedding memorable and photographically beautiful."
Designers like Marysia, Anemos and Giambattista Valli have sporadically offered swimsuit options in their collections, though they have not developed a fully dedicated bridal line.
Demi Raquel Thomas, a designer based in Marina del Ray, Calif., debuted her ready-to-wear bridal swimwear company, La Chenille Bridal Bikini, in April 2021 with a pop-up launch event in New York. The company concentrates on bachelorette parties, honeymoons and wedding wear.
"These are one-of-a-kind pieces that make brides look and feel as special as if they were wearing a traditional wedding gown," said Ms. Thomas, who plans to open a showroom in Manhattan next year. Her bridal line is currently only available on her website.
Ms. Thomas says she has seen a 25 to 30 percent increase in sales from 2021 to 2022.
Still, an overall lack of offerings has made finding bridal swimwear challenging. Elizabeth Paladeau, 31, the senior manager of special projects for Gucci who lives in Manhattan, said she had trouble finding a special swimsuit for her three-day Amalfi Coast Beach wedding last September. She said she "didn't find a trove of bridal swimwear options, because they weren't as trendy as they are now," she said. (She ended up wearing a Chanel white one-piece with black piping and a matching crystal netted skirt.)
In the past, Ms. Thomas explained, brides typically wanted just one or two outfits. "Gen Zs and millennials want five or six, for the ceremony, reception, first dance, cutting of the cake, after party and beach themed activities," she said.
Before plunging into the bridal swimwear market, Ms. Thomas spent a year immersed in research. She hired an online marketing company and acquired data and statistics about the fashion and wedding industry, among other things.
"This is a niche category," she said, "I learned 60 percent of couples were having or wanted beach or a pool weddings. I realized no one was offering a high-end, luxury look that was also comfortable to wear."
Ms. Thomas started out with about 20 pieces, including swimsuits, cover-ups and jackets, custom made with beaded and sequined fabric like organza and toile. Then, they are adorned by hand-sewn appliqués, crystals, taffeta, and trim. Depending on style and craftsmanship, tops can cost $ 600 to $ 800, bottoms from $ 550 to $ 800, and one pieces around $ 1,300 to $ 2,000. Full-length cover-ups can start at $ 1,800 and go as high as $ 7,000.
"We have a rose coat with 200 organza and toile roses," she said of a jacket that costs $ 6,000. "I didn't want to be a middle market brand." She said she is also looking into eventually offering plus-size pieces.
Ms. Sabag, who lives in Roslyn, N.Y., started Karen Sabag Bridal, in 2008, offering handcrafted, atelier dresses. Her designs range in price from $ 10,000 to $ 30,000 and beyond. Over the last several years, "more brides were asking for swimsuits," she said.
In November 2020, she created Rêver (which means dream in French), specializing in custom, hand-embellished swimsuits and lingerie. This summer, she will open her first Rêver flagship store in Gravesend, Brooklyn, offering 18 swimsuit styles and 40 interchangeable items, including cover tops, overlays and lingerie. Like Ms. Thomas, Ms. Sabag uses imported Chantilly and beaded lace, delicate silks, pearls, stones, embroidery and corsetry.
"I'm a detailed designer," she said. "These are high-end couture pieces that can be worn in the water, with a cover-up, and look like bridal dresses." Her swimsuits cost $ 450 to $ 1,200 while cover-ups range from $ 800 to $ 2,500.
Ms. Sabag says she sees more than 200 brides in a year, and about half of them buy swimsuits.
"That's a huge number," she said, adding that women who are not planning weddings "are also buying the line, and wearing our tops and cover-ups with jeans and pants. "There's a demand for this. It's become a recognized entity to bridal wardrobes."

Full text: In the third episode of the new season, Carrie displays her Covid style, and Seema tries to recover her stolen Hermès bag.
This article contains spoilers for Episode 3 of the second season of "And Just Like That ..."
In the third episode of "And Just Like That ...," the show seems to reach back to its "Sex and the City" past and pull out previously featured handbags and nostalgia for a bygone New York.
Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is recording her memoir and managing difficult memories of her deceased husband, John, by shopping and faking Covid. Seema (Sarita Choudhury) has her Birkin bag stolen in front of her apartment, and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), who is still in Los Angeles, is feeling so transformed that she decides to get a tattoo.
Ahead of the third episode, reporters and editors on the Styles desk discussed some of the most memorable accessories and thematic throwbacks in the latest installment of the series.
Vanessa Friedman I think we have to talk about stolen handbag déjà vu. When Seema's Birkin was taken, it sent me right down the rabbit hole to "Sex and the City," Season 3, when Carrie's Fendi Baguette was snatched -- and then a very similar Baguette reappeared in this episode.
Jeremy Allen Once again, purse as plot point!
Madison Malone Kircher That Baguette popped up in Season 1, too!
VF Handbags are the Proustian madeleines of this show.
Louis Lucero II A yearning for the days of Giuliani's New York? It seemed to be where this episode took place. And I don't know what's more implausible to me: the idea that a mugger in 2023 wouldn't recognize a Birkin bag or that thousands of pedestrians over the course of two days wouldn't.
VF Good point, Louis. How was that actually quite large Birkin just lying under shrubbery?
JA I was also struck by how Covid really became a plot point for the first time in this series -- especially sartorially. Carrie, of course, puts her own twist on pandemic-era athleisure. In the first episode, she pairs an oversize New York Times sweatshirt with, well, nothing, and in this one, she wears a Monopoly sweatshirt with a semi-sheer tiered skirt, Barbiecore kitten heels and an Oy Vey mask for her faux bout with the virus.
Callie Holtermann I caught myself laughing a couple of times during this episode -- sometimes with the characters and other times at them. Carrie faking Covid to get out of her obligations was funny. So was Seema's Louis Vuitton logo-print mask.
MMK I will come clean and say the final line made me laugh: "And just like that ... I got Covid."
VF I will also come clean and say I derived a certain amount of satisfaction when it turned out my prediction of more Loewe during our last chat actually came true, with the balloon heels in Carrie's Bergdorf Goodman shoe shopping spree.
CH Vanessa, I was about to congratulate you for this. The balloon shoes were one of the episode's bids for relevance that actually did work for me. Those shoes are crazy, they're everywhere -- and I can totally see Carrie buying them and wearing them to, like, a farm in the Hudson Valley.
JA An issue that "And Just Like That ..." seems to be constantly negotiating is having one designer-clad foot squarely in the past and the other tepidly in the present. It's clear the straddling can sometimes be uncomfortable for the writers -- but also, perhaps, for us.
Katie Van Syckle What tattoo did you think Miranda would end up with? I was expecting a robot.
MMK I don't know what I thought she would pick, but I certainly didn't think Miranda "The Brainy One" Hobbes was going to opt for tattooing her own initials on her wrist.
KVS With serifs!
LL Let's briefly venture into the speculative: What else might M.H. have stood for?
CH Max HBO.
LL Mondays? Harrumph!
KVS Mayor Hobbes.
MMK Anybody want to predict what we're going to see next episode? Sartorially or otherwise? Vanessa, you're already on the board with Loewe.
JA Miranda in jumpsuits for $ 1,000? Seema in zebra stripes? Lisa Todd Wexley in baubles that wouldn't make it past the T.S.A.?
CH Lily, Charlotte's newly rebellious daughter, gets a septum piercing.
VF Definitely Seema in more animal print. I think odds are high for a Chanel bag or two. More LV.
KVS More New York City merch and wearable New York pride.
LL Mark my words: We'll see Carrie in Rachel Comey's New York Review of Books collection before midseason.

In Ruined Town, Resolved to Stay 'Until the End': [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Russia Destroyed Their Town. They're Not Leaving.
In the town of Avdiivka, in eastern Ukraine, the near-constant Russian shelling has reduced the city to rubble.
In recent weeks, the assaults have only intensified. By March, only around 1,700 people remained from a prewar population of about 30,000.
Life is precarious. Because of the danger, other civilians have been barred from entering the town, and public workers and children have been given mandatory evacuation orders.
Still, those who remain insist they will stay, moving underground as the bombardments claim yet another piece of their homes.
Once a bedroom community for the nearby city of Donetsk, Avdiivka has long stood at the front line of war.
Beginning in 2014, Ukraine's fight against Russian-backed separatists played out on their doorsteps as the town became a key defensive position for Ukrainian forces. When the full-scale Russian invasion began in February last year, Avdiivka came under heavy assault.
Serhiy Albertovych, 63, steps carefully across the rubble on the ground floor of the apartment building he calls home. It was bombed in March 2022 and again one year later.
"People used to live here, but they left," he said. "Today, I'm the only inhabitant of the street."
He dried moldering bread on the floor in one of the apartments in an attempt to be able to eat it.
He was offered an evacuation but turned it down.
"I'm here alone and I'll be here until the end, until the end of my life," he said.
Russian forces have been trying to seize Avdiivka for more than a year, blasting it with artillery strikes and probing the perimeters. In the nine years since war first came here, the area around Avdiivka has become something of a labyrinth of defensive positions.
As Russian troops continue to put pressure on the town's perimeters, Ukrainian forces have dug in to resist their advance. The fighting remains fierce. On Thursday, military officials said that Russians had attacked in the area using tanks, multiple rocket launchers and artillery. Ukrainian troops had held their positions, they said.
But within what remains of the town, there is another network forged by the last holdouts.
Igor Golotov, 40, has been living in the ruins of the town and volunteering to help other inhabitants survive.
"When they started shelling the city, many people immediately packed up and left," Mr. Golotov said. "Those who, as they say, had patience, fearlessness, over time it disappeared, as well."
But, he said, many simply would not leave. They have no money and no idea where to go. It took considerable convincing to encourage his own mother to leave the city. But eventually, she relocated to the relative safety of Vinnytsia, in central Ukraine.
Still, he is amazed at the resilience of the people who have chosen to stay.
"I'm telling you, people have adapted to everything," Mr. Golotov said. "They have settled down, they are leading their lives. If only there was no shelling -- they have everything, they have their everyday life."
Inna, 57, who did not give her last name, chose to stay behind after her husband and her children were evacuated to care for her father, who is older and sick. He refused to leave, she said, tears creeping into her eyes when she spoke of her children.
At the city's heart is the once-thriving Avdiivka Coke and Chemical Plant, one of the largest producers of coke, a coal-based fuel, in Europe.
The industrial product is important to steel production, and before the war, more than 4,000 people worked at the plant, which produced 12,000 tons of coke per day.
Now, heavily damaged by Russian bombing, the plant is no longer operational. The factory has been badly damaged by aerial assaults. The furnaces that once blazed have been shut down. A small crew of workers remains for basic maintenance, but it is unknown if the plant will ever be able to reopen.
Many who stayed are former workers at the plant, and some of them are now taking shelter in the basement of the spectral industrial space.
Mykhailo Orlov, 65, is one of just two doctors who remain in the city's hospital.
"It's very difficult when there are a lot of injured people, and we don't have enough staff to help them all at once," he said. "And everyone does what they can." The mining company, Metinvest, which owns the main factory and provides aid to the town, regularly sends medicine and other supplies to the hospital.
"Whatever we need, we make a list and send it," Mr. Orlov said. "That way, for three to four months, we have everything we need."
It is not just injuries from the conflict.
The hospital treats older patients with diabetes and other chronic illnesses.
"Everyone comes here, and we try to help everyone as much as we can," he said.
On a recent morning, a woman injured in an artillery attack was helped to the hospital by her son and a neighbor. Her son looked on while Dr. Orlov stabilized the patient for a potential evacuation to the hospital in Pokrovsk, nearly 40 miles away.
Dr. Orlov's apartment was destroyed, so he lives in the hospital and sleeps only when there are no patients.
"I have to be useful here," he said. "I'm staying here because it's my little homeland."

Full text: So does the pop culture and fashion wheel turn.
And just like that, stealth wealth, the aesthetic made viral by "Succession," with its toxic billionaires in their Loro Piana baseball caps and Tom Ford hoodies locked in a C-suite cage match to the death, has been swept off screen.
In its place: logomania, branding that can be seen from whole city blocks away and accessories that jangle and gleam with the blinding light of bragging rights.
The outfits, that is to say, of Carrie and Co. in Season 2 of "And Just Like That ...," the "Sex and the City" reboot come recently to Max -- the streamer that, as it happens, also gave us the Roys in their greige cashmere. Both shows are set in New York City, the home of strivers and entrepreneurs, of "Washington Square" and Wharton, of constantly evolving social castes highly, and literally, invested in their own identifiable camouflage.
If watching "Succession" was in part like engaging in a detective game to suss out what character was wearing what brand, so insider were the fashion politics, watching "And Just Like That ..." is like attending brandapalooza: the double Cs and Fs and Gs practically whacking you on the head with their presence. (Warning: Spoilers are coming.) All the over-the-top fashionista-ing is back. The room-size closets!
It's the yin to the "Succession" yang: a veritable celebration of the comforting aspirational dreams of self-realization (or self-escapism) embedded in stuff that may actually be the most striking part of an increasingly stale series. Certainly, the clothes, which often serve as their own plot points, are more memorable than any dialogue.
Well ... except maybe for that instantly classic line in Episode 1, uttered by Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) on her way to the Met Gala in reference to her gown and feather hat: "It's not crazy -- it's Valentino." But that's the exception that proves the rule.
There is Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), with her multiple Manolos and Fendis, self-medicating with shopping, returning home one day with six Bergdorf Goodman bags. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) toting her Burberry doggy poop bag (also possessed of a Burberry apron and Burberry ear muffs) and bemoaning the fact that her teenage daughter hocked her Chanel dress to fund her musical aspirations.
Lisa Todd Wexley dropping her kids off for camp in a bright green Louis Vuitton jacket and scarf. And Seema (Sarita Choudhury), the character that passes for a restrained dresser thanks to her penchant for neutrals (and the occasional animal print), loudly lamenting the theft of her caramel-colored Hermès Birkin -- one of her totems of self, ripped directly from her hands.
There is Loewe and Pierre Cardin; Altuzarra and Dries Van Noten. There is also an effort to repurpose clothes, like Carrie's wedding dress, in order to promote the virtues of rewearing, but it's pretty much lost in all the rest of the muchness. There is a dedicated Instagram account on which the costume designers Molly Rogers and Danny Santiago share their finds, with 277,000 followers. @Successionfashion, by contrast, has 184,000.
All of which means what, exactly? Is the era of quiet luxury, so recently embraced by TikTok, already at an end? Have our attention spans, so famously abbreviated, moved on? Has the physics of fashion exerted its force and produced an equal and opposite reaction to an earlier action?
As if. In many ways, the fashion in "And Just Like That ..." seems to protest too much. In part that's because it seems like a regurgitation of the fun that came before, which was itself a reaction to the minimalism of the early 1990s, which itself was born in that decade's recession.
The fact is, no matter how much lip service has been paid to quiet luxury or stealth wealth or whatever you want to call it, and how it is 2023's "hottest new fashion trend," it was never a recent invention. It has been around since way back when it was referred to as "shabby chic" or "connoisseurship" or "old money," all synonyms for the kind of product that didn't look overtly expensive but was a sign of aesthetic genealogy -- the difference between new money and inherited money that fashion co-opted and regurgitated to its own ends. Just as more obviously coded consumption has been around since Louis Vuitton plunked his initials on some leather back in 1896 or since Jay Gatsby started tossing his shirts.
We've been declaring the "end of logos" and, alternately, the "rise of stealth wealth" for decades now. There are cycles when one is more ubiquitous than the other (usually having to do with economic downturns when flaunting disposable income is not a great look), but they exist in tandem. They help define each other.
Consider that during the current economic uncertainty, exactly the kind of environment that tends to fast-forward the appeal of low-key high-cost items, the most successful global brands have remained the most highly identifiable: Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Hermès. Or that in his recent debut for Louis Vuitton, Pharrell Williams introduced a bag called Millionaire that costs -- yup -- $ 1 million. (It's a yellow croc Speedy with gold and diamond hardware.)
What is more interesting is, as Carrie and the gang continue on their merry wardrobed way, how clichéd both styles now seem, how performative. Once they have trickled up to television, it's impossible not to recognize the costume. Or the fact that whichever look you buy into, they are simply different ways of expressing wealth, in all its decorative strata. And wealth itself never goes out of fashion.

Full text: Paris men's wear caught fire during a week of zillion-dollar spectacles, skinny fits and Jay-Z's surprise appearance at Pharrell Williams's debut for Louis Vuitton.
Models on Ozempic, dazzling guys in sequins, superstars everywhere you turned: Look, it's King James! Sheesh, there goes Rihanna! OMG, Beyoncé! Those screams you're hearing? Fangirls losing their minds for Cha Eun-woo, the pretty singer from the K-pop boy group Astro.
The week just past was emphatically one of fashion as an S.E.O. experiment, test field for an ever-evolving global ecology, increasingly monocultural, of luxury goods. Yes, there were talented indies. There were great masters from outside the mainstream, most notably Rei Kawakubo. There were some seasoned and celebrated, although not sufficiently recognized, talents like Grace Wales Bonner. There were survivors like Kim Jones at Dior Homme and lots of gifted comers showing men's and women's wear and, well, everything in between.
Take, for example, Marine Serre, who served up her most commercial riff to date on upcycled yarn waste and deadstock, here rendered as armor for warriors of the urban night (as well as molls in trash drag.) Let's hear a round of applause for an evening dress made from a granny afghan. Try rocking that one at the Met Gala, Lil Nas X.
Consider Rick Owens, showing in full doom-mode outdoors on the river-facing plaza of the Palais de Tokyo as if he had not seen a weather report. The predicted thunderstorms never arrived, and yet Mr. Owens showered guests anyway with drifts of gunpowder and wreaths of sulfurous fog from fireworks mounted on scaffolds and blasted into the Parisian sky.
The show was titled "Lido," after Mr. Owens's seaside getaway in Venice, yet it had more than a whiff of Burning Man. An observer would be hard-pressed to find clear connections between the soft littoral landscape of the Venetian lagoon and Mr. Owens's sternly constricting offerings: peaked shoulders like the budding wings of dark angels; high-waisted trousers with long hems trailing like the uncoiled wraps of a mummy's shroud; high-top versions of therapeutic leg braces and Brutalist "concrete sandals" -- perhaps the thing for one terminal dip into the Adriatic.
There were also studies in cool elegance, as at Dries Van Noten. Like the celebrated geyser, this designer can be counted on to deliver, sometimes with bursts from the creative core, occasionally with desultory puffs. This occasion registered as something in between.
That is, he provided uncontroversial gabardine trousers worn under trench coat skirts, twin sets for men, knit velvets, mousseline shirts teasing flashes of nipple and, most notably, sequined shorts. We have seen versions of this before from other designers. Yet such is the fickleness of fashion that suddenly they seemed eminently wearable.
Part of that is the Paris effect. Next to Tokyo among great world capitals, this city has the greatest capacity to frame the outlandish. Against its backdrop the clusters of Rei Kawakubo devotees strolling along the fashion rialto that is the Rue St.-Honoré -- in trousers with hoop-belled hems or deconstructed frock coats or other outlandish garb -- seem like welcome legations from distant galaxies.
Janet Flanner, the brilliant Paris correspondent for The New Yorker, once remarked that Picasso, even as a genius, had more gifts than he could deploy. Possibly the same could be said of Ms. Kawakubo who, like Picasso in his 80s, shows little sign of slackening pace.
"In order to find a new world, we have to go beyond reality," Ms. Kawakubo said in a gnomic note accompanying her Comme des Garçons collections. Of course, you could argue that the opposite is equally the case.
For the current collection, Ms. Kawakubo showed collared black frock coats in which waistbands were the hems of inverted shorts; double layered jackets; upside-down trousers; jungle prints; and Gary Card headbands embedded with what looked like flotsam. Oh, and there were the Oxford shoes right out of Meret Oppenheim. Were the wearers coming or going in properly bench-made, if Surrealist, Oxfords featuring two shoes per foot, either layered or headed in different directions?
Where Ms. Kawakubo is coolly cerebral Mike Amiri wears sincerity on his sleeve. When he took a bow at the end of his show with his family, it was hard to resist enthusiasm for this self-made Californian designer who, showing for several seasons in Paris, has urged his loyal consumers to ride along with him as he follows taste shifts away from streetwear toward soft tailoring, leaving behind the perennially juvenile cult of the sneakerheads.
Officially, Mr. Amiri's inspiration was a chill Los Angeles style. What it more closely resembled -- shirts and long shorts in leather woven like bistro chairs, silly flower embellishments, shorts-and-shirts like cabana sets -- was attire for rich Miamians. If you accept that geography is commercial destiny, next stop on the fashion caravan is South Florida.
In a packed schedule that proved the runway show is in no peril of disappearing, there were some shows that fell flat, like showroom appointments passing themselves off as something else. (Yes, you, Officine Générale.) There were bombastic statements like Kim Jones's anniversary collection at Dior Homme (he has survived there five years, a lifetime in the luxury goods trade), replete with fine boxy tailoring that almost made you imagine his next stop may be Chanel.
And there were moments of pure theater and elevated design. The best of these was produced by Jonathan Anderson at Loewe and staged inside the 18th-century stableyard of the elite Garde Républicaine -- France's version of the Royal Horse Guards.
Mr. Anderson often seems like the rare thought leader in the industry, a designer connected to culture in ways that have little to do with the trashy slipstream of social media. The fountains that were the centerpiece of his show were the work of the American sculptor Lynda Benglis, great bronze extrusions that suggested organic eruptions or frozen waves. They nicely counterbalanced the severity of Mr. Anderson's designs, which included trousers with waists so snug and high they turned the upper torso into a bust, boxy gray sweaters like Colorforms shapes and fully sequined shirt and trouser separates.
They called to mind the glittering '60s, specifically Andy Warhol's foil-covered Silver Factory, which, by coincidence, is being evoked by a show at the Gagosian Gallery on the Place Vendôme. "It was the perfect time to think silver," Warhol later wrote of the period and of his storied studio. Silver was both the future and the past, he noted. Astronauts wore it. Hollywood actresses from the Golden Age were photographed in it. Most important, mirrors are backed with silver. "Silver was narcissism," Warhol said. Can anyone doubt that he was, as usual, prophesying the next Age of Narcissism, that of TikTok and Instagram?
Given that, the commercial logic of Louis Vuitton's new chief executive Pietro Beccari's hiring Pharrell Williams to design its men's wear collection seems as irresistible as a bulldozer.
Let the naysayers cluck about Mr. Williams's design offerings, in some sense lost amid a zillion-dollar spectacle during an evening in which Vuitton colonized central Paris, taking over the storied Pont Neuf; painting it in the pattern of its trademark Damier print; and importing the Voices of Fire gospel choir from Virginia, Mr. Williams's home state, to sing a rousing composition of his titled "Joy (Unspeakable)" that tapped into Black spirituality as a promotion vehicle for unabashed materialism. ("If you want it, you can have it!" they belted out. "If you need it, you can have it!")
In a consolidated luxury goods sphere, where three groups (LVMH, Kering and Richemont) control nearly the entire ecosystem, market capture amounts to the one true religion. Designers are its missionaries, and on Tuesday evening, Mr. Williams seemed exactly like the person to take us all to church on the way to the bank.
The clothes, to the surprise of no one familiar with Mr. Williams's feel good music, were solidly commercial ("Every single thing will sell," as one retailer said.) Much of it was rendered in a pixilated Damouflage pattern that owed a debt to an earlier experiment by Mr. Williams's friend Nigo at Kenzo; lug-soled versions of the mid-calf rain boot Kanye West has been flogging for some time; Damier denim trench coats, suits, biker and varsity jackets; Mary-Jane shoes; and the all important Keepall, Alma, Neverfull and Speedy bags that, let's face it, are what Louis Vuitton shows are really all about.

PARIS — Models on Ozempic, dazzling guys in sequins, superstars everywhere you turned: Look, it’s King James! Sheesh, there goes Rihanna! OMG, Beyoncé! Those screams you’re hearing? Fangirls losing their minds for Cha Eun-woo, the pretty singer from the K-pop boy group Astro.

Overlooked No More: Dolores Alexander, Feminist Journalist and Activist: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: She was a reporter, executive director of the National Organization for Women and owner of the restaurant Mother Courage, which became a hub for women.
This article is part of Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times.
Dolores Alexander had a few distinct careers throughout her life.
She worked for The New York Times, Newsday and Time magazine. She was executive director of the National Organization for Women, working alongside its president and co-founder, Betty Friedan. And she was a founder of the organization Women Against Pornography.
But she was perhaps best known for opening one of the first feminist restaurants in the United States, Mother Courage, with Jill Ward, her girlfriend at the time. The restaurant, in Manhattan's meatpacking district, became a hub in the 1970s for women's liberation groups who would gather in its dining room after feminist protest marches and legislative victories -- or even, on an average day, just to have a meal.
"It was important at a time when women, feminists, were being attacked, that we had a place where we could get together," Lucy Komisar, a freelance journalist, said in an interview. "Guys would go to a pub or a men's club and hang out, but women didn't have anything like that. This was a women's club. It was important because it was our place."
What linked all of Alexander's efforts was her devotion to promoting women's rights and feminism.
"She was a stalwart in the women's movement from the beginning of the second wave," Ward said in an interview. "It meant so much to her that she just geared her life toward that, doing as much as she could, whatever it was."
Dolores DeCarlo was born on Aug. 10, 1931, in Newark, to Dominick and Sally (Koraleski) DeCarlo. Her parents both came from immigrant families, her mother's from Poland and her father's from Italy.
Dolores, along with her brother, Richard, her parents and some of her other relatives, lived with her paternal grandparents in a two-story wood frame house in a depressed working-class neighborhood. "It was a very crowded house," Alexander said in an interview conducted in 2004 and 2005 with the Sophia Smith Oral History Archive at Smith College. "But I remember Sunday mornings because that was when Mary" -- her grandmother -- "would make the spaghetti. There was an enamel table, and she'd roll out the dough."
Both her parents worked at Koppers Coke, a plant in Kearny, N.J., that produced fuel to heat homes. Her mother later worked for a paper cup manufacturing plant.
Dolores attended Roman Catholic schools in New Jersey and continued living at home after high school, working as an office clerk with the Equitable insurance company.
She described her father as "authoritarian" and highly traditional. "He really wanted me to stay at home, have kids and live next door," she said.
But she had a different plan for herself, and she yearned to go to college. She saved enough money for tuition and enrolled at New York University. There she met Aaron Alexander, who worked in public relations and was studying for his master's degree to become a teacher. He encouraged Dolores to switch to the City College of New York, which was more affordable. They married in 1950 (her father, upset when he found out that Aaron was Jewish, refused to pay for the wedding) and later moved to an apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan; they divorced after about five years.
In her senior year, Dolores Alexander became a reporting intern for The New York Times. She asked to join the staff as what was then called a "copy boy," but, she later recalled, she was told by the city editor that "it would cause a revolution in the newsroom if he hired a girl for the job." In 1961, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in language and literature and was hired as a reporter at The Newark Evening News. But she found that women writers there weren't given much support.
"Often the assignments that we got were female-type assignments, to cover parades or, you know, feature-type stuff," she said.
Three years later, she moved to Newsday, on Long Island, where she was one of three women on staff working as reporters. At first, she said, she was "assigned a lot of stuff like covering local meetings and things like that. It was boring, and I hated it."
"She asked to be transferred to the Style section, where she got to write profiles, which she loved.
In 1966, Alexander came across a news release announcing the establishment of NOW. She called Friedan, author of the landmark feminist book "The Feminine Mystique," and joined the small, mostly volunteer team, leaving Newsday in 1969 to become the group's first executive director.
Tensions between her and Friedan were often high because, by Alexander's account, Friedan was domineering. One subject about which they disagreed was the visibility of lesbians; feminist organizations were often dismissed based on a stigmatization of lesbianism -- "People would say, 'You're a dyke. You're a lesbian. They're all lesbians,"' Ward said -- and Friedan and others tried to distance NOW from that image.
"It was OK with her if women were lesbians," Alexander said. "She just didn't want them to talk about it." Friedan, she said, "felt that this would hurt the women's movement. And there was some validity to that."
Alexander was fired from NOW in 1970, as part of what she described as "a lesbian purge" that took place when Friedan felt she was being backed into a corner. "Somehow I became her scapegoat," she said. "I suddenly became a lesbian who was working with other lesbians in a conspiracy to take over NOW" -- although "I was not a lesbian, and there was no such conspiracy."
Muriel Fox, one of the founders of NOW, and former national chair of the organization, refuted Alexander's claims.
"She was fired," she said in an interview, "strictly because the president, Betty Friedan, could not get along with her executive director."
In her oral history, Alexander said she started "sexually experimenting" in 1968 and fell in love with Ward in 1970. One night that summer, while the couple were living in Bridgehampton, N.Y., Ward was driving home on the Long Island Expressway at 4 a.m. and couldn't find a place to eat.
"I was really hungry," Ward said. "I thought, could I go for a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs." When she finally arrived home, she said: "I told Dolores, 'I have a great idea for a business: Let's open a feminist restaurant."'
They rented what Alexander called a "filthy, dirty" ramshackle diner and gut-renovated it. They called it Mother Courage, in honor of the female protagonist of Bertolt Brecht's play of the same name, and opened the doors in May 1972. The menu was basic, with dishes like Greek salad, veal parmigiana and, as envisioned, spaghetti and meatballs.
The food was not the key to the restaurant's success, however; it was the women it drew.
Patrons included the authors Audre Lorde and Kate Millett, the cultural critic Jill Johnston, the singer-songwriter Maxine Feldman, the psychotherapist Phyllis Chesler and the author and activist Susan Brownmiller. The NBC News anchor Linda Ellerbee would also stop by, simply to dine after work, knowing it was a safe place where she wouldn't get hassled, Ward said.
Alexander became the public face of the restaurant. "She treated it as a salon," Ward said. "I was more nuts and bolts, making sure that the dinner orders were getting out. She would be more like a host, sitting down to schmooze with people."
But after five years, Alexander started to "ease her way of the restaurant" by taking a job at Time magazine, Ward said, adding that she too "was getting burned out," and that "we both started thinking, 'how many years can we do this?"'
Mother Courage closed in 1977, and Alexander and Ward ended their relationship.
In the 1980s, Alexander became one of the founders of, and national coordinators for, the organization Women Against Pornography, working with Brownmiller and Dorchen Leidholdt. She traveled the United States, going to college campuses with Linda Lovelace and Harry Reems, who played the lead roles in the 1972 film "Deep Throat," and who had heated debates onstage about the impact of pornography on women and society. When Lovelace released "Ordeal" (1980), her memoir about the behind-the-scenes abuse that took place during the making of that film, Alexander provided support, as did Gloria Steinem.
Alexander died on May 13, 2008, in Palm Harbor, Fla., of pulmonary obstruction and congenital heart disease. She was 76. Her papers from her time at NOW are held at the Schlesinger Library at Harvard University, and her other correspondence, writings and documents are held at Smith College.

Governors Island Lawn Party Revisits the Jazz Age: [Style Desk]

Full text: Hundreds of time travelers in 1920s-era outfits took ferries to Governors Island earlier this month to attend the two-day Jazz Age Lawn Party, one of New York City's most curious summer traditions.
They wore flapper dresses with feather boas, pinstripe suits with black-and-white wingtips and lots of boater hats, cloche hats and bow ties. Gathered on picnic blankets in a grassy field, they passed the day sipping gin and tonics before dancing to hot jazz performed by the Dreamland Orchestra.
A man wearing pink pants and suspenders drank beer from a Mason jar while his young son, also in suspenders, sat on his shoulders. Lines gathered outside a stand that sold newsboy caps and another that offered on-site tintype portraits. A pie contest included the category, "Hobo's Choice," which rewarded the confection most likely to be "stolen off a back porch."
The orchestra was conducted by the pencil-mustached bandleader Michael Arenella, who started the event in 2005. "We were pretty much the first event out here," he said. "It was maybe 50 people then. People are drawn to the Roaring Twenties because there's a youthfulness to the era. After the war, people were looking to have a good time, after their brush with mortality."
In the edited interviews below, re-enactors on the second day named their Jazz Age fashion heroes and pondered whether they would actually time travel back to the era.
Cyrene Renee
If you could time travel back, would you? I'd go back. I'd be a showgirl at the Cotton Club and be the best dancer there. As much as I love the era, I don't think life was better, though. There was segregation. Yet despite what we were going through as people of color, we created beautiful dance, music and art.
Do you have a Jazz Age fashion hero? Josephine Baker, all day, every day. She was righteous and liberated in her beauty.
Inez Robinson
Would you go back? I can't romanticize that period, as a person of color, but I'm very drawn to the era's fashion. As a Harlem native, I have an affinity for the Harlem Renaissance. African Americans were using fashion to carry themselves proudly every single day.
Jazz Age fashion hero? Coco Chanel. Her designs introduced gender fluidity. She pioneered the idea you could go both ways.
Skip Diatz
Would you time travel back? People think of the 1920s as one big party, but it was just good for a few people of certain persuasions. It was also a time of intolerance and prejudice. I'd probably go back just for a weekend. However, this is only one time period I'm involved with as a re-enactor. I did a World War II event the other weekend, and I was at a Revolutionary War event recently in Mount Vernon.
Your old-timey fashion hero? Douglas Fairbanks Jr. He was married to Joan Crawford and was the best dressed man in Hollywood.
Michael Arenella
Would you go back? I'd like to go back, because I relate to the simplicity of that time. Don't get me wrong, it was a harder life, and lots obviously wasn't good, but things were simpler then, and I feel we've gotten further from that.
Jazz Age fashion hero? Gary Cooper. He was just starting out, and he had that elegant swagger. You don't see elegant swagger in a man these days.
LaVerne Cameron
Would you time travel back? Yes, because I think people were happier then, though I'd want to arrive before the Great Depression. Women's liberation was starting and so much of that fashion remains stylish today, from sequins to headbands.
Old-timey fashion hero? Carole Lombard. She married Clark Gable and died in a plane crash. She started the blond hair trend.
Jesse Rosen and Taylor Dunston
Would you go back?
J. R.: I think there are aspects of me that wouldn't fare so well then, but to experience those parties, I don't know .... If I could come back, sure, but I'd stay here if it was a one-way ticket.
Jazz Age fashion hero?
T. D.: I can't immediately think of one but I feel Tom Ford pulled heavily from this era. His suits are masculine yet use feminine color palettes. He loves a luxurious full lapel with strong shouldering, like the gangsters wore. You could argue the power suit was born in the 1920s and that Ford borrowed from it.
Michael Asante
Would you go back? I'd be naïve to say any era was better, but in terms of fashion, I'd like it if everyone still dressed like this. The mobsters in particular, with their red ties and cigars, were really bringing it.
Jazz Age fashion hero? I feel Karl Lagerfeld was channeling the Jazz Age. The gloves. The white collar. His white cat, Choupette, in a carrier basket.
Charles Annunziato
Would you go back? Probably not. The prohibition era was a time of hardship. Now we can get liquor whenever we want.
Jazz Age fashion hero? Bonnie and Clyde. Because they did whatever the hell they wanted.
Caroline Shaffer and Marissa Koors
Would you go back?
C.S.: Absolutely not. I like having the internet and rights as a woman.
M.K.: Only with a return trip. I have rights in this era and so do my friends and allies. We also have medicine. I could have gotten the Spanish flu.
Jazz Age fashion hero?
C.S.: Jean Harlow. She played unremorseful characters, like women who got involved with married men, yet she played them in a surprisingly likable way.
M.K.: Elsa Schiaparelli. She took from surrealism and said, 'What if we put lobsters on our dresses?' Wearing Schiaparelli was to wear art.
Alvin and Marla Nichter
Would you go back?
M.N.: I think I would have fit right in. It was a ladylike time. A time of gentleman. Girls were girls. Men were men. Wait, could I get in trouble for saying that? What I mean to say is it was a stylish feminine era, which I like.
Jazz Age fashion hero?
A.N.: My glamorous great-aunt. She was a fashion buyer for the top New York department stores back then. She'd go to Paris to bring back the latest fashions for New Yorkers. I've seen pictures of her. She was the bee's knees.

To Help Return Stolen Picasso, He Needed Dad: [National Desk]

Full text: The Picasso fell off the proverbial truck. It vanished from a loading dock at Logan International Airport in Boston and wound up where it didn't belong, in the modest home of one Merrill Rummel, also known as Bill.
In fairness, this forklift operator had no idea that the crate he tossed into his car trunk contained a Picasso until he opened its casing. In fairness, he didn't care much for it; he preferred realism.
But now things had turned all too real. F.B.I. agents were hot on the trail of a hot Picasso unavailable for public viewing, as it was hidden in Rummel's hallway closet. He and his fiancée, Sam, began to panic.
"How do we get rid of it?" she recalled thinking. "We couldn't just give it back. It was a pain in our butt."
Fortunately, Rummel knew a guy. Someone particularly skilled at making problems melt away. A fixer.
He dialed a number he knew by heart.
The Case of the Missing Picasso, revealed here for the first time, goes back. Back before the much more notorious theft of 13 works of art from Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1990. Back, in a sense, to a time before Picasso had even painted the piece in question.
Back to the 1950s of Waterville, Maine, where the Rummel boys -- Bill and his younger brother, Whit -- were testing their hometown's Yankee forbearance. If one was looting parking meters for his coin collection, the other was pilfering pens from Woolworth's. If one was stealing radios from junked cars, the other was racing his car so recklessly that it seemed destined for the junkyard.
But their father, Whitcomb Rummel Sr., always managed to calm the aggravated constabulary with assurances that he would handle it. And he did: When 12-year-old Whit -- known in the family as "Half-Whit" -- was caught stealing from Woolworth's, his father forbade him from entering any shop for a year.
"Not even into the corner store for a Coke," the son, now 76, recalled. "This meant my mother had to bring clothes out to the car so I could try on pants because I couldn't go into the store."
Neither son dared to cross their father. "He was all-knowing, all-seeing, all-hearing," Whit Rummel said.
Rummel the elder never spoke of his own childhood; too painful, perhaps. His mother died of influenza when he was 9, after which his father sent him away to an affection-averse aunt. "It wasn't until after high school that he reconnected with his father," Whit Rummel said.
He attended college, did some acting, married, served with the Navy Seabees in Africa during World War II and moved to Waterville, where he bought and spiffed up a local ice cream stand. His frozen treats became a favored local delight, available at Gustafson's market, the Chicken Coop restaurant, Bea's Candy Kitchen -- even Mid-State Motors, where a gasoline purchase came with a pint of Rummel's.
The man behind the brand was just as ubiquitous, a Chamber of Commerce leader, Kiwanis bigwig and Shriner poobah. He donated a scoreboard to the town gymnasium, presented the police with a trained German shepherd, sponsored a semipro baseball team and gave away banana splits to children for civic spirit, or academic success, or just for being kids.
At home he was a quirky dad, sometimes fun and even zany, but often stern. "He never hugged us," Whit Rummel said.
To Waterville's relief, the Rummel boys moved on. Whit went to Tulane University in New Orleans. Bill served with the Coast Guard in Michigan, where he fell in love with a bowling-alley bartender whose customers called out "Play it again, Sam" so often that her given name, Evelyn, became a gutter ball.
When his Coast Guard hitch ended in 1968, Bill joined Emery Air Freight, then the country's largest cargo airline. He worked nights on the company's loading dock at Logan airport, where, in early 1969, a crate arrived from Paris.
Inside, a Picasso: "Portrait of a Woman and a Musketeer."
Pablo Picasso, then in his late 80s, had become intrigued by the musketeer as evocative of the old masters, especially Rembrandt, and returned to the theme again and again. "It was the idée fixe of his very late work," said Pepe Karmel, a professor of art history at New York University. "I think he was asking himself: 'Where does my art stand in relation to the old masters?"'
The painting, completed in 1967, was to be forwarded from Boston to a Milwaukee gallery owned by Irving Luntz. His son, Holden Luntz, recalled that his late father bought the piece from Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, a prominent dealer in Paris known for championing Picasso. Since negotiations took place on his father's 40th birthday, he said, Kahnweiler agreed to sell the work for $ 40,000.
"A gesture of generosity," said Holden Luntz, who owns a photography gallery in Palm Beach, Fla.
But the Picasso never made it to Milwaukee. An anxious Irving Luntz contacted Emery to complain, but the cargo company had its own emerging problem, with what came to be known in New England as the 100-hour storm.
The protracted late February snowfall paralyzed Boston, including the airport, where more than two feet of snow disrupted passenger flights and cargo deliveries. Large containers littered the tarmac, while boxes and packages clogged the docks.
"Our dock was a mess," Bill Rummel said in a 2007 interview with Ira Glass for an ultimately shelved episode of the "This American Life" radio program.
With outbound crates at the front and inbound crates at the back, Emery executives demanded a decluttering of the dock. Under pressure, Rummel said, his supervisor pointed to a crate with a missing label and said: Take that with you when you go home tonight.
It should be noted that, according to Rummel, this supervisor was later fired. For stealing.
Rummel angled the crate into the trunk of his 1962 Chevy Impala and, a few days later, lugged it into his half of a two-story home in Medford, Mass. He pried it open with a hammer to discover that he was now in possession of a Picasso.
Its artistry underwhelmed him, he told Glass. "Not a Wyeth, put it that way."
Rummel called his fiancée, Sam. "You'll never guess what I've got," Ms. Rummel, now 79, recalled him saying. "A Picasso!"
"What are you, drunk?" she asked.
She returned to their home to find a big crate leaning against the wall.
"You want to see it?" he asked.
"Hell, no," she said.
The couple hid the crate in the closet beneath the stairwell. "We shoved that thing so far back there, and then shoved stuff in front of it," Sam Rummel said. "We never talked about it."
But someone was talking about it: Irving Luntz, the Milwaukee gallery owner. After weeks of being Picasso-less, he contacted the F.B.I., which began snooping around Logan. This unnerved a certain affianced couple in Medford.
"Worried? Are you kidding?" Sam Rummel said. "We were young. We didn't want to go to jail."
Unsure of what to do, Bill Rummel called his brother, Whit, who was more knowledgeable about art. He had once torn a photograph of a Picasso out of a library book to hang in his bedroom.
In effect, Whit's first question was: Have you called the fixer?
Of course. Dad.
The elder Rummel listened to his older son's predicament and then offered two options with all the calm of a soda jerk asking: whipped cream or hot fudge?
1. They could bury the Picasso in the foundation of a Waterville restaurant under renovation that his father co-owned. (Its name, The Silent Woman, seemed apropos.) Unearth the painting in 30 years and maybe sell it for a small fortune.
Or:
2. Return it.
When Bill Rummel asked his father what he thought he should do, the elder Rummel said that this was a life choice he had to make for himself.
"So I said, 'I'll give it back,"' the son told Glass. "And he said, 'I'll help you."'
The elder Rummel telephoned Whit in New Orleans and gave him detailed instructions for a handwritten note that could not be traced. Use high-end stationery. Since you're left-handed, write it out with your right hand. And since you're studying creative writing, make it sound artsy. Then send it by airmail to your brother in Medford.
Meanwhile, the F.B.I. was turning up the heat, issuing a bulletin to law-enforcement agencies throughout the Northeast. Picasso stolen from Logan airport. Be on the lookout.
Days later, the ice cream king of Waterville arrived in Medford with his wife, Ann, a new trench coat, and a plan. He rubbed the painting's packaging and crate with Vaseline, for reasons that evaded his son. He attached the handwritten note. He donned the trench coat, a brimmed hat, and gloves. Go time.
Three years after this escapade, Whitcomb Rummel would die, suddenly, at 63; in his honor, his restaurant would stay closed until the evening ice cream rush. His son Bill would spend the next 30 years with Emery, rising to regional manager before retiring to South Carolina and dying, at 71, in 2015.
But on this April Fools' Day in Boston, 1969, father and son were sharing an unforgettable moment: loading a purloined Picasso into a Chevy Impala.
Bill Rummel, wearing a black watch cap and sunglasses, drove them into Boston and, at his father's direction, parked on Huntington Avenue. His father got out and carried the crate a few car lengths ahead.
The elder Rummel loaded the painting into a taxi, handed the driver a $ 20 bill and told him to deliver the package to the Museum of Fine Arts, just down the avenue. He returned to his son's car and, on the drive back to Medford, tossed the coat, hat and gloves in separate garbage cans.
Newswire services were soon circulating photographs of Perry T. Rathbone, the museum's esteemed director, posing with both the recovered Picasso, worth an estimated $ 75,000, and a mysterious handwritten note, which read:
"Please accept this to replace in part some of the paintings removed from museums thruout the country."
It was signed "Robbin' Hood."
Luntz, the Milwaukee gallery owner, told a television station that he was "absolutely delirious and delighted to get this painting back." And yes, he said, prospective buyers were lining up.
A few days later, on the Emery loading dock at Logan, Bill Rummel's boss called him over and motioned to a certain crate in the middle of the floor, bound for Milwaukee.
They found it, his boss said.
Oh, he answered.
Whit Rummel, also known as Robbin' Hood, is a filmmaker in Chapel Hill, N.C. He has long thought that his family's Picasso story had the makings of a movie, and kept all the news clippings as proof of a tale that for decades could not be told. But he sensed a potential plot hole:
Where did the Picasso wind up?
A couple of years ago he hired Monica Boyer, an editor and financial writer, to track it down. She could not find mention of the work in auction-house records or in various Picasso databases, and, of course, the artist had created many musketeer-themed paintings.
Still, by drawing on a few clues -- Milwaukee, for example -- she found a catalog for a 1971 exhibition called "Picasso in Milwaukee." Among the works on display: "Portrait of a Woman and a Musketeer," courtesy of Sidney and Dorothy Kohl.
Sidney Kohl, 92 and living in Palm Beach, Fla., is a member of the family behind the Kohl's department-store chain. He is an extremely wealthy developer, investor and art collector; in 2012, eight pieces from the Kohl couple's collection sold at auction for $ 101 million.
That sale did not include the Picasso, and the Kohls did not respond to several requests to confirm that the painting -- no doubt worth millions of dollars -- is still in their private collection.
Wherever it is, this work by the most celebrated artist of the 20th century remains as shielded from public view as if it had stayed hidden in the hallway closet of a forklift operator. But that working stiff had at least tried to return it to the world, with some help, of course, from the ice cream king of Waterville, Maine.

Shaking Things Up From Inside the Castle: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Earlier this month, Pharrell Williams was in the men's atelier on the second floor of Louis Vuitton's corporate office in Paris, sunglasses on, surveying his new perch.
"Listen," he said conspiratorially. "This window is different."
The window by his desk looks out over the small plaza on the north side of the Pont Neuf, where in just a couple of weeks, his first show as Louis Vuitton men's creative director would take place. A 50-foot statue of the artist Yayoi Kusama, a Vuitton collaborator, hovered just outside. The rapper Pusha T and the streetwear innovator Nigo were milling about.
Since Mr. Williams's appointment was announced in February, he has spent a great deal of his time here, in this office and in the workshops that abut it, getting accustomed to holding the reins of the huge business he had been put at the creative helm of -- the first time a musician has been given such a grand platform in luxury fashion.
"I pinch myself every day," he said. "This is the equivalent of a castle to me. I mean, the Seine River right there -- it's like the moat."
The long path from his childhood in Virginia Beach through hip-hop producer stardom to streetwear design impact to pop music ubiquity to here was very much on his mind. "I'm a Black man -- they have given this appointment to a Black man," he said. "This is the crown jewel of the LVMH portfolio. It's everything, and I was appointed to rule in this position. So No. 1, a ruler of a position is usually like a king. But a ruler of this position for me is a perpetual student. It's what I intend to be."
A little bit later in the afternoon, Mr. Williams, 50, slipped off his blazer and slipped on a brown motorcycle jacket in full LV monogram print leather. Emblazoned on the back, in studs, were the words "PUPIL" and "KING."
His appointment to the helm of Vuitton's men's business is, depending on your perspective, a full-throated acknowledgment of the power of Black cultural capital on a global stage and a watershed moment in the absorption of hip-hop class politics into luxury fashion. Or it's a bellwether of challenging times to come for traditionally trained clothing designers who aspire to top posts, and a suggestion that global celebrity moves the needle more than directional design, even for the most successful luxury brands.
Either way, Mr. Williams did not apply for the job -- he was chosen.
In December, Alexandre Arnault, a scion of the LVMH dynasty and a longtime friend, sent Mr. Williams a text: "Please call me. The time has come."
Mr. Williams thought Mr. Arnault was perhaps going to run some name options by him for the Vuitton job. "I had been pushing somebody else," he said. "I had been pushing Nigo. My brother, always."
Nigo -- the founder of the brands A Bathing Ape and Human Made, the co-founder with Mr. Williams of Billionaire Boys Club and one of the most significant streetwear innovators -- had already been named artistic director of Kenzo, another LVMH brand.
Instead, Mr. Arnault extended the offer to Mr. Williams. "I had always wanted to work with him, in any way, shape or form since I started working in the group, which is already 10-plus years ago," Mr. Arnault said. "And it was just never the right time because either the companies were too small to work with someone as big as him, or there were already people in charge, or he was working with Chanel. And stars were so aligned now, finally."
Mr. Williams said, "I'm not calling it fortune -- I'm calling it favor."
Hiring Mr. Williams was one of the first decisions overseen by Pietro Beccari, a longtime LVMH executive, who was announced as chairman and chief executive of Louis Vuitton in January. "After Virgil, I couldn't choose a classical designer," Mr. Beccari said. "It was important that we found someone having a broader spectrum than being a very fantastic designer, which is great for the industry and we have many of them. But for that particular place, at Louis Vuitton, after Virgil, I thought we needed something more. Something that went beyond just pure design."
Mr. Williams signed the contract on Valentine's Day and soon relocated his wife and four children and much of his team. "Listen, I miss my house in Miami," he said. "And my house in Virginia. I really do. But right now, Paris is the center of the earth for me."
Playing the Game, or Not
His skin is as good as you think it is -- the additional pressure, or labor, or scrutiny of his new position has left no creases.
There was ease in his silhouette, too: a tight black double breasted vintage Vuitton blazer and well-worn white LV Trainer Snow Boots peeking out under bunched-up, flared dark bluejeans embroidered with faces derived from paintings by the Black artist Henry Taylor. The pants -- one of a few pieces Mr. Williams has deployed Taylor's work for -- will appear in the spring-summer 2024 collection, which will be shown in Paris on June 20.
He requested a tailor to come take a look at the hem of the jeans, which was a smidge too long on one side, and then sauntered over to the main conference table in the room, where he asked some colleagues to pull up images from his first ad campaign. It featured a pregnant Rihanna clutching multiple Louis Vuitton Speedy bags in primary colors, one of the first playful tweaks Mr. Williams is bringing to the company's heritage. The Speedy, one of Louis Vuitton's most recognizable designs, dates to 1930 and resembles a doctor's bag.
"I am a creative designer from the perspective of the consumer," he said. "I didn't go to Central Saint Martins. But I definitely went in the stores and purchased, and I know what I like."
He told Mr. Beccari something similar. "He said, 'I don't feel like a creative director here, I feel like a client,"' Mr. Beccari recalled, adding that he trusted Mr. Williams's natural instincts despite his never having managed a business of this scale. "I didn't even have to speak to him about the commercial importance of what he does and the importance in terms of turnover and volume of sales, but just the importance in terms of impact."
Mr. Williams looked at his Rihanna ads the way one might pose after a particularly athletic dunk. He pointed to one and said, "That's the golden ratio." For emphasis, he had an associate pull up the same image overlaid with the long golden spiral, the center of it landing directly on Rihanna's belly.
"What I love about this is, it's the biggest fashion house in the world, and that is a Black woman with child," Mr. Williams said.
Sarah Andelman, the founder of the pioneering Paris retailer Colette, and a collaborator of Mr. Williams's, said he makes creative choices "not just for the sake of doing things. There is a story and, I would say in French, profondeur, a meaning to what he will do."
Mr. Williams basked in the refracted shine from the screen full of Rihanna images.
"I know there's a game," he said. "I'm just not here to play it."
The Two-Decade Crash Course
Almost since the beginning of his career in music, Mr. Williams had found ways to incorporate, and create, fashion. In 2003, he founded Billionaire Boys Club with Nigo, perhaps his closest creative ally in style. Explaining the creative kinship between the two men, Nigo, through an interpreter, said, "The first time I went to Pharrell's house in Virginia, when I looked in the wardrobe, everything was the same as what I owned."
In 2003, Mr. Williams met Marc Jacobs, then the men's creative director of Vuitton, who invited him to collaborate on a pair of sunglasses. The result, known as the Millionaires, became a hip-hop luxury staple in the mid-2000s and an updated version of them is still sold today.
"He was just so incredibly generous to give me that opportunity when nobody had ever given any of us an opportunity to be creative," Mr. Williams said of Mr. Jacobs. (The Millionaires were designed by Mr. Williams, with Nigo.)
"I thought the way forward for Louis Vuitton was to collaborate with other creatives," Mr. Jacobs said. "It didn't matter to me whether they were from music or art or other fashion designers, whether it was Stephen Sprouse, Takashi Murakami or Pharrell."
Back then, when Mr. Williams arrived in Paris, Mr. Jacobs gave him vouchers to shop in the stores. "I was very nouveau riche at that time," Mr. Williams said, tilting his head down and offering just the tiniest hint of a knowing smirk. Mr. Williams also designed jewelry for Vuitton a few years later.
Other collaborations followed: Moncler, G-Star, Moynat, Reebok, a long partnership with Adidas and an almost decade-long affiliation with Chanel and Mr. Williams's close friend Karl Lagerfeld.
But none of those gigs had the complexity, or stakes, of his current assignment.
"Over the past several weeks he's had a crash course in design and how to run a studio and how to manage a team of 40, 50 people and how to take criticism and work with the people at the top because, you know, it's a blend of creativity and also running a business," said Matthew Henson, who has been a personal stylist for Mr. Williams for the last couple of years.
Mr. Henson is also styling the show, along with Cynthia Lu, Mr. Williams's former assistant who is now a quiet powerhouse of idiosyncratic streetwear with her brand Cactus Plant Flea Market.
When Mr. Williams walks through the studios, his awe for the specialized design teams appears genuine. "Presto, things get turned around so fast," he said. "I've had more resources than I've ever had in my entire life. They just don't miss. Like at all. None. Nobody."
That was something he was prepared for, in part, by conversations he had with Virgil Abloh, after Mr. Abloh was hired for this same job in 2018. In the three years at the helm of Vuitton's men's wear before his sudden death in late 2021, Mr. Abloh upended ideas about how a luxury house might function, and what story it might be able to tell in dialogue with those who had long been held at arm's length from luxury fashion. Just outside the atelier hangs the crucial, defining image from Mr. Abloh's first ad campaign for Louis Vuitton: a Black toddler draped in a "Wizard of Oz"-themed sweater, one of Mr. Abloh's first signature pieces.
Mr. Williams recalled Mr. Abloh's awe at the scale and efficiency of the atelier. "He would always talk about how they never say no, which they don't," he said. "So that's a responsibility not to abuse them."
Mr. Williams is now the second consecutive Black American in the role. "Over here, they lift us," he said. "They appreciate what we do. They see the talent that we have."
The Arnault family, he said, understands how crucial the Black American dollar and aesthetic has been to the growth and cachet of Louis Vuitton: "One hundred percent they know it," he said. "We've had some conversations about how important the community is to them, and how being supportive to them is a natural and a prerequisite."
He is looking to expand the house's brand ambassador program beyond the usual musicians and actors to Black academics, Black authors, a Black astrophysicist, even a Black bass fishing champion.
"They have to be supportive of the culture because the culture contributes to the bottom line," he said.
A New Humility
There are some things that Mr. Williams simply will not say. In public settings, at least, he speaks with the deliberateness of someone who wants no word to be misapprehended. His sunglasses stay on. ("I need something for myself," he said.) Rhetorically, he returns to familiar narratives and motifs -- the seismic changes in his life every 10 years, the eternal quest for learning, the continuing practice of gratitude.
"He never speaks the truth of himself, and I hate it," said Pusha T, who has known Mr. Williams for three decades. "It's my pet peeve about him. He knows he's great at things, but he wants that to walk him through the door versus him saying, 'Hey guys, come on. Let me through."'
Squint hard, though, and you may see the faintest flickers of the mid-2000s Pharrell Williams, a more boisterous and boasty person. A whiff of the old self popped out in a video Mr. Williams posted in late January, backstage at the Kenzo show with Nigo, when he knew he was on the verge of signing his contract. "You know what rhymes with 2023? Money money tree," he said into his phone camera, nodding intensely. He didn't lick his lips, but he might as well have.
When the appointment was announced, Tyler, the Creator, a longtime acolyte and style guru in his own right, FaceTimed Mr. Williams. "He just has this look he gives me where he kind of just goes like, 'Yeahhhh, I did that.' He didn't say anything," Tyler said. "And then he gave me the praying hands."
On his 2006 mixtape "In My Mind: The Prequel," a dizzying display of Dionysian ostentation, a peacock at the peak of his peacocking, Mr. Williams rapped, "We wanted this life, we salivated like wolves/ Blow a hundred grand on LV leather goods."
Mr. Williams almost flinched at the memory: "I was greeeeeasy on that."
Now, he said, "I promise you I really love being humble." But luxury fashion is not a business built on humility, and Mr. Williams is keen to make a splash.
The theme of his debut show, Mr. Williams said, will be "lovers." The first inklings of his vision emerged in April, at a Virginia festival that Mr. Williams organizes called Something in the Water, for which Vuitton made merch. It was received coolly.
Of potential negative criticism, Mr. Williams pleads equanimity. "I'm a student -- students learn," he said.
Mr. Henson said he didn't think Mr. Williams was expecting any "grace or favor" because of who he is. "He's expecting even more criticism and harsh critique," he said.
Mr. Williams shrugged. "It's not where my mind is, just because I think I err on the side of working with master artisans, and we're just literally working on the details," he said.
Staying Curious
An afternoon with Mr. Williams in creative director mode is a little bit like playing a first-person shooter. Requests pop in from unexpected directions, at erratic rhythms. Just when things get calm, someone emerges from around a corner with a mood board, or a vintage garment and a swatch of fabric it might be reimagined in. After being shown a hood with a novel but useful zipper, Mr. Williams nodded. "I don't want anything to be just for aesthetics," he said. "Everything has to have a real function."
For the second day in a row, he was wearing a Mickey Mouse T-shirt by Human Made, this time underneath a soft black leather biker jacket, and his flared jeans were in a Damier pattern.
A tailor brought out a mock-up of a double-breasted blazer for Mr. Williams to try on. One of the designers asked if he wanted "a very sartorial pocket" added to the design.
"Sartorial," Mr. Williams said. "Do you follow that guy on Instagram? The Sartorialist?"
For his first collection, he is leaning heavily on the checkerboard Damier print but reworking it in clever ways -- digital camo or, in Mr. Williams's parlance, "damouflage," and tweaking the colors away from the familiar browns and grays.
"Every season it's going to be a different colorway," he said, likening the playfulness to Takashi Murakami's neon monogram print during the Jacobs era. The soles of various shoes will be a modified Damier pattern. On a conference table were a pair of damoflage sweatsuits set aside for his parents ("My dad is a player," he said.)
Mr. Williams, who made waves in 2007 with his oversize purple crocodile Hermès Haut à courroies bag, is most tickled by the opportunity to innovate on the Speedy, which he is remaking in several primary colors, and also in an exaggerated, oversize silhouette. A yellow Speedy in meltingly soft leather sat on the pool table that serves as an impromptu work space in the atelier, almost slumping under its own very light weight.
"I want to give you that same experience that you get when you go to Canal Street, a place that has appropriated the house for decades, right?" Mr. Williams said. "Let's reverse it. Let's get inspired by the fact that they'll make some colorways that the house has never made. But then let's actually make it the finest of leather."
The day before, Mr. Williams had taken a moment to chat about designing a custom look for Naomi Campbell, including a zipped sports bra and zipped miniskirt, all in monogrammed leather ("'60s vibes, go-go"), and debating skirt lengths. "It'll work, but I don't know if it'll be as sexy," he said.
He also surveyed a pair of ship-shaped bag options, one steamer-like, one a bit shorter, and picked from various trim color and font options. "This seems to be the crispiest," he said, pointing to a white trim. He held one bag in each hand, then handed them to Nigo, who stomped off down the office in a mock model walk.
What Nigo did for Mr. Williams two decades ago, Mr. Williams is now doing for those who grew up admiring him.
"Me and him have a 20-year difference in age and man, what that does for me at my age is like, oh, it's still no ceilings," Tyler said. "To see someone at his age with his milestones, with his résumé, to not only still strive for a new world, stay curious, look for something new and something to challenge himself and let his creativity bleed into something else aside from just a drum pattern. And then actually get it. He not only strived for and did it, but actually nailed it -- it means so much to me."
Mr. Williams's new designs include printed leather jerseys and rugbys, quilted denim, Mao-neck blazers and ghillie camo with LV logo cutouts. He was excited to walk to the back of the studio, where the footwear designers work, and go over some eccentric ideas: Mary Janes and bowling shoes, a stone-encrusted snowboard boot, a design that initially scanned as a soccer sneaker but is actually a hard-bottom shoe. "I ain't even gonna lie," he said. "I was trying to do that at Adidas for years."
A little earlier, he was in front of his window, where he'd set up a small studio, and while fiddling with his Keystation 88 -- a keyboard and sound controller -- he asked his engineer to cue up a new song, tentatively called "Chains 'n Whips," that he was considering using as part of the show's soundtrack. Over a fusillade of psych-rock guitar flourishes, Pusha T rapped along to a pointed line in the chorus: "Beat the system with chains and whips!"
"That was made in this room," Mr. Williams said. "We just start walking around and looking out this window and you just see all of this. I mean, we beating this system, bro."

Hey Dad, Can You Help Me Return the Picasso I Stole?

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
The Picasso fell off the proverbial truck. It vanished from a loading dock at Logan International Airport in Boston and wound up where it didn’t belong, in the modest home of one Merrill Rummel, also known as Bill.
In fairness, this forklift operator had no idea that the crate he tossed into his car trunk contained a Picasso until he opened its casing. In fairness, he didn’t care much for it; he preferred realism.
But now things had turned all too real. FBI agents were hot on the trail of a hot Picasso unavailable for public viewing, as it was hidden in Rummel’s hallway closet. He and his fiancée, Sam, began to panic.
“How do we get rid of it?” she recalled thinking. “We couldn’t just give it back. It was a pain in our butt.”
Fortunately, Rummel knew a guy. Someone particularly skilled at making problems melt away. A fixer.
He dialed a number he knew by heart.
The Case of the Missing Picasso, revealed here for the first time, goes back. Back before the much more notorious theft of 13 works of art from Boston’s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1990. Back, in a sense, to a time before Picasso had even painted the piece in question.
Back to the 1950s of Waterville, Maine, where the Rummel boys — Bill and his younger brother, Whit — were testing their hometown’s Yankee forbearance. If one was looting parking meters for his coin collection, the other was pilfering pens from Woolworth’s. If one was stealing radios from junked cars, the other was racing his car so recklessly that it seemed destined for the junkyard.
But their father, Whitcomb Rummel Sr., always managed to calm the aggravated constabulary with assurances that he would handle it. And he did: When 12-year-old Whit — known in the family as “Half-Whit” — was caught stealing from Woolworth’s, his father forbade him from entering any shop for a year.
“Not even into the corner store for a Coke,” the son, now 76, recalled. “This meant my mother had to bring clothes out to the car so I could try on pants because I couldn’t go into the store.”
Neither son dared to cross their father. “He was all-knowing, all-seeing, all-hearing,” Whit Rummel said.
Rummel the elder never spoke of his own childhood; too painful, perhaps. His mother died of influenza when he was 9, after which his father sent him away to an affection-averse aunt. “It wasn’t until after high school that he reconnected with his father,” Whit Rummel said.
He attended college, did some acting, married, served with the Navy Seabees in Africa during World War II and moved to Waterville, where he bought and spiffed up a local ice cream stand. His frozen treats became a favored local delight, available at Gustafson’s market, the Chicken Coop restaurant, Bea’s Candy Kitchen — even Mid-State Motors, where a gasoline purchase came with a pint of Rummel’s.
The man behind the brand was just as ubiquitous, a Chamber of Commerce leader, Kiwanis bigwig and Shriner poobah. He donated a scoreboard to the town gymnasium, presented the police with a trained German shepherd, sponsored a semipro baseball team and gave away banana splits to children for civic spirit, or academic success, or just for being kids.
At home he was a quirky dad, sometimes fun and even zany, but often stern. “He never hugged us,” Whit Rummel said.
To Waterville’s relief, the Rummel boys moved on. Whit went to Tulane University in New Orleans. Bill served with the Coast Guard in Michigan, where he fell in love with a bowling-alley bartender whose customers called out “Play it again, Sam” so often that her given name, Evelyn, became a gutter ball.
When his Coast Guard hitch ended in 1968, Bill joined Emery Air Freight, then the country’s largest cargo airline. He worked nights on the company’s loading dock at Logan airport, where, in early 1969, a crate arrived from Paris.
Inside, a Picasso: “Portrait of a Woman and a Musketeer.”
Pablo Picasso, then in his late 80s, had become intrigued by the musketeer as evocative of the old masters, especially Rembrandt, and returned to the theme again and again. “It was the idée fixe of his very late work,” said Pepe Karmel, a professor of art history at New York University. “I think he was asking himself: ‘Where does my art stand in relation to the old masters?’”
The painting, completed in 1967, was to be forwarded from Boston to a Milwaukee gallery owned by Irving Luntz. His son, Holden Luntz, recalled that his late father bought the piece from Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, a prominent dealer in Paris known for championing Picasso. Since negotiations took place on his father’s 40th birthday, he said, Kahnweiler agreed to sell the work for $40,000.
“A gesture of generosity,” said Holden Luntz, who owns a photography gallery in Palm Beach, Florida.
But the Picasso never made it to Milwaukee. An anxious Irving Luntz contacted Emery to complain, but the cargo company had its own emerging problem, with what came to be known in New England as the 100-hour storm.
The protracted late February snowfall paralyzed Boston, including the airport, where more than 2 feet of snow disrupted passenger flights and cargo deliveries. Large containers littered the tarmac, while boxes and packages clogged the docks.
“Our dock was a mess,” Bill Rummel said in a 2007 interview with Ira Glass for an ultimately shelved episode of the “This American Life” radio program.
With outbound crates at the front and inbound crates at the back, Emery executives demanded a decluttering of the dock. Under pressure, Rummel said, his supervisor pointed to a crate with a missing label and said: Take that with you when you go home tonight.
It should be noted that, according to Rummel, this supervisor was later fired. For stealing.
Rummel angled the crate into the trunk of his 1962 Chevy Impala and, a few days later, lugged it into his half of a two-story home in Medford, Massachusetts. He pried it open with a hammer to discover that he was now in possession of a Picasso.
Its artistry underwhelmed him, he told Glass. “Not a Wyeth, put it that way.”
Rummel called his fiancée, Sam. “You’ll never guess what I’ve got,” Sam Rummel, now 79, recalled him saying. “A Picasso!”
“What are you, drunk?” she asked.
She returned to their home to find a big crate leaning against the wall.
“You want to see it?” he asked.
“Hell, no,” she said.
The couple hid the crate in the closet beneath the stairwell. “We shoved that thing so far back there, and then shoved stuff in front of it,” Sam Rummel said. “We never talked about it.”
But someone was talking about it: Irving Luntz, the Milwaukee gallery owner. After weeks of being Picasso-less, he contacted the FBI, which began snooping around Logan. This unnerved a certain affianced couple in Medford.
“Worried? Are you kidding?” Sam Rummel said. “We were young. We didn’t want to go to jail.”
Unsure of what to do, Bill Rummel called his brother, Whit, who was more knowledgeable about art. He had once torn a photograph of a Picasso out of a library book to hang in his bedroom.
In effect, Whit’s first question was: Have you called the fixer?
Of course. Dad.
The elder Rummel listened to his older son’s predicament and then offered two options with all the calm of a soda jerk asking: whipped cream or hot fudge?
1. They could bury the Picasso in the foundation of a Waterville restaurant under renovation that his father co-owned. (Its name, The Silent Woman, seemed apropos.) Unearth the painting in 30 years and maybe sell it for a small fortune.
Or:
2. Return it.
When Bill Rummel asked his father what he thought he should do, the elder Rummel said that this was a life choice he had to make for himself.
“So I said, ‘I’ll give it back,’” the son told Glass. “And he said, ‘I’ll help you.’”
The elder Rummel telephoned Whit in New Orleans and gave him detailed instructions for a handwritten note that could not be traced. Use high-end stationery. Since you’re left-handed, write it out with your right hand. And since you’re studying creative writing, make it sound artsy. Then send it by airmail to your brother in Medford.
Meanwhile, the FBI was turning up the heat, issuing a bulletin to law-enforcement agencies throughout the Northeast. Picasso stolen from Logan airport. Be on the lookout.
Days later, the ice cream king of Waterville arrived in Medford with his wife, Ann, a new trench coat and a plan. He rubbed the painting’s packaging and crate with Vaseline, for reasons that evaded his son. He attached the handwritten note. He donned the trench coat, a brimmed hat and gloves. Go time.
Three years after this escapade, Whitcomb Rummel would die, suddenly, at 63; in his honor, his restaurant would stay closed until the evening ice cream rush. His son Bill would spend the next 30 years with Emery, rising to regional manager before retiring to South Carolina and dying, at 71, in 2015.
But on this April Fools’ Day in Boston, 1969, father and son were sharing an unforgettable moment: loading a purloined Picasso into a Chevy Impala.
Bill Rummel, wearing a black watch cap and sunglasses, drove them into Boston and, at his father’s direction, parked on Huntington Avenue. His father got out and carried the crate a few car lengths ahead.
The elder Rummel loaded the painting into a taxi, handed the driver a $20 bill and told him to deliver the package to the Museum of Fine Arts, just down the avenue. He returned to his son’s car and, on the drive back to Medford, tossed the coat, hat and gloves in separate garbage cans.
Newswire services were soon circulating photographs of Perry T. Rathbone, the museum’s esteemed director, posing with both the recovered Picasso, worth an estimated $75,000, and a mysterious handwritten note, which read:
“Please accept this to replace in part some of the paintings removed from museums thruout the country.”
It was signed “Robbin’ Hood.”
Luntz, the Milwaukee gallery owner, told a television station that he was “absolutely delirious and delighted to get this painting back.” And yes, he said, prospective buyers were lining up.
A few days later, on the Emery loading dock at Logan, Bill Rummel’s boss called him over and motioned to a certain crate in the middle of the floor, bound for Milwaukee.
They found it, his boss said.
Oh, he answered.
Whit Rummel, also known as Robbin’ Hood, is a filmmaker in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. He has long thought that his family’s Picasso story had the makings of a movie, and kept all the news clippings as proof of a tale that for decades could not be told. But he sensed a potential plot hole:
Where did the Picasso wind up?
A couple of years ago he hired Monica Boyer, an editor and financial writer, to track it down. She could not find mention of the work in auction-house records or in various Picasso databases, and, of course, the artist had created many musketeer-themed paintings.
Still, by drawing on a few clues — Milwaukee, for example — she found a catalog for a 1971 exhibition called “Picasso in Milwaukee.” Among the works on display: “Portrait of a Woman and a Musketeer,” courtesy of Sidney and Dorothy Kohl.
Sidney Kohl, 92 and living in Palm Beach, Florida, is a member of the family behind the Kohl’s department-store chain. He is an extremely wealthy developer, investor and art collector; in 2012, eight pieces from the Kohl couple’s collection sold at auction for $101 million.
That sale did not include the Picasso, and the Kohls did not respond to several requests to confirm that the painting — no doubt worth millions of dollars — is still in their private collection.
Wherever it is, this work by the most celebrated artist of the 20th century remains as shielded from public view as if it had stayed hidden in the hallway closet of a forklift operator. But that working stiff had at least tried to return it to the world, with some help, of course, from the ice cream king of Waterville, Maine.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A Navy veteran and a regular presence at Donald Trump's side, he is said to have played a central role in helping to thwart government efforts to retrieve classified documents.
On May 25, as former President Donald J. Trump was at the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournament at his course in Sterling, Va., one of his aides was photographed leaning toward him and dutifully adjusting the collar of his white pullover, a moment of closeness that had become routine for the pair.
The timing of the photograph was noteworthy: One day earlier, the aide, Walt Nauta, had been notified by the government that he was a target of a federal investigation into Mr. Trump's handling of classified documents, suggesting that charges against Mr. Nauta were likely.
On Friday, prosecutors unsealed those charges. Mr. Nauta, a 40-year-old Navy veteran, was charged with conspiracy, making false statements and withholding documents as part of Mr. Trump's effort to thwart the government's attempts to reclaim the classified documents Mr. Trump had taken with him when he left the White House.
Mr. Nauta's story is, among other things, a cautionary tale about what loyalty to Mr. Trump can bring. After serving his country in the military and serving as a valet in the White House, Mr. Nauta stayed with Mr. Trump as a personal aide -- and now faces the prospect of years in federal prison for having apparently carried out his wishes.
Until now largely unknown to the public, Mr. Nauta has been thrust into the spotlight as a low-level but central figure in the conspiracy being alleged by prosecutors. Mr. Nauta, who has been on Mr. Trump's campaign payroll, was part of Mr. Trump's traveling retinue during a trip to Georgia and North Carolina on Saturday.
The unsealed indictment lays out a detailed picture of him fulfilling chores for Mr. Trump, moving boxes in and out of a storage room at Mar-a-Lago during a critical period: the weeks between the issuance of a subpoena last year demanding the return of all classified documents in the possession of Mr. Trump's presidential office and a visit to Mar-a-Lago soon after by federal prosecutors seeking to enforce the subpoena and collect any relevant materials.
During that time -- from May 11, 2022, to June 3, 2022 -- Mr. Nauta, at Mr. Trump's direction, moved boxes of materials taken from the White House either in or out of a storage room at Mar-a-Lago at least five times, the indictment says.
It says that he removed a total of 64 boxes from the storage room but only brought back about 30, with the rest unaccounted for. All of this took place, the indictment says, before one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, M. Evan Corcoran, started to sort through the material in the storage room in an effort to find any remaining classified documents.
On the same day that the prosecutors arrived at Mar-a-Lago to meet with Mr. Corcoran and collect the classified material, Mr. Nauta and others "loaded several of Trump's boxes with other items on aircraft that flew Trump and his family north for the summer," the indictment says.
Well before the indictment was filed on Thursday in Federal District Court in Miami, the authorities had been trying to get Mr. Nauta to turn on Mr. Trump and cooperate with their investigation. As early as last fall, prosecutors in Washington ratcheted up the pressure on Mr. Nauta and his lawyer, Stanley Woodward Jr., saying they were skeptical of Mr. Nauta's account and indicating that he could face charges in the case.
Around the same time, according to two people familiar with the matter, Mr. Woodward had a meeting about Mr. Nauta with prosecutors in the documents investigation, including Jay Bratt, from the Justice Department's national security division, who was running the inquiry at the time.
During the meeting, the people said, Mr. Bratt tried to persuade Mr. Woodward to get Mr. Nauta to cooperate and then brought up the fact that he knew Mr. Woodward had a pending application to be a judge in the superior court in Washington. Mr. Trump's lawyers and advisers believe that Mr. Bratt was effectively trying to cajole, even threaten, Mr. Woodward to counsel his client to help the government -- an allegation that Mr. Trump later made himself on social media, albeit with his facts slightly wrong.
Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel Jack Smith, who now oversees the documents case, has declined to comment on the allegation.
Mr. Woodward also declined to comment.
Mr. Trump's allies have said that the threat of an indictment hovering for months took a toll on Mr. Nauta, who has been described as a stoic presence around Mr. Trump.
Now that charges have been filed, the pressure on Mr. Nauta has only increased. The obstruction charges he faces carry maximum penalties of 20 years in prison, and the indictment sets forth in detail what he did for Mr. Trump and what prosecutors believed he lied about.
For instance, the incidents involving the storage room at Mar-a-Lago were not the first time that Mr. Nauta apparently moved boxes at Mr. Trump's direction. The indictment also points to earlier episodes that took place over months as officials at the National Archives and Records Administration were trying to retrieve roughly two dozen boxes of material that they believed Mr. Trump had taken with him when he departed the White House.
Between November 2021 and January 2022, Mr. Trump told Mr. Nauta and another employee at Mar-a-Lago to bring boxes to his residence at the compound so that he could go through them, apparently before returning them, according to the indictment. Mr. Nauta and the other employee updated each other via text messages about Mr. Trump's progress with the boxes.
An episode from December 2021 suggests that Mr. Nauta could have known the boxes contained sensitive materials.
That month, the indictment says, he took a picture of boxes that had tipped over, causing their contents to spill across the floor of the storage area, and sent the image to the other employee. Among the papers strewn on the floor was a secret document related to the "Five Eyes" program, an agreement among the intelligence agencies in the United States, England, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
On Jan. 13, 2022, Mr. Nauta texted the other Trump employee and said, "He's tracking the boxes, more to follow today on whether he wants to go through more today or tomorrow." Four days later, Mr. Nauta and the other employee packed boxes into Mr. Nauta's car and took them to a commercial truck for the National Archives to retrieve, the indictment said.
Prosecutors have accused Mr. Nauta of making several false or misleading statements about much of this during an interview with the F.B.I. on May 26, 2022.
Mr. Nauta falsely told investigators that he was "not aware of Trump's boxes being brought to Trump's residence for his review," the indictment said. Mr. Nauta also lied, the indictment said, by claiming that he had no idea how the boxes that he and the other employee had taken from Mr. Trump's residence to the truck outside got to the residence in the first place.
A native of the U.S. territory of Guam, Mr. Nauta enlisted in the Navy in 2001. He ended up working at the White House during the Trump presidency, first in the mess, which is run by the Navy. Though deeply private, Mr. Nauta quickly became a genial presence who exhibited a military member's sensibility about working for the commander in chief, and the two men developed a rapport.
His colleagues found him to be efficient and apolitical, according to one former co-worker. He was able to anticipate Mr. Trump's needs, the former colleague said -- a key component for dealing with the former president -- but also was aware of his eccentricities.
Mr. Trump trusted him and liked him immensely, according to his former co-workers. Mr. Nauta moved from the mess to being a valet who was around Mr. Trump more frequently, bringing him Diet Cokes, ensuring the president's suit was pressed and carrying hair spray or hand sanitizer to meet Mr. Trump's needs.
He retired from the Navy after Mr. Trump left the White House and went to work for the former president at Mar-a-Lago, one of the few constants in Mr. Trump's shrunken orbit at the time.
Former aides to Mr. Trump who observed Mr. Nauta closely said that unlike many who have gotten close to Mr. Trump over the years, Mr. Nauta did not seem to be working a "side hustle" to monetize or get famous from his access to the former president.
He now finds himself in a position several others have: attached to Mr. Trump as he's targeted by prosecutors.
Others who have been there include Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former lawyer and fixer, and Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization.
Mr. Cohen and Mr. Weisselberg both pleaded guilty to charges in cases in which charges were not brought against Mr. Trump. Both served time in prison. And in both cases, Mr. Trump and his allies insisted the men's actions were independent of Mr. Trump, a notion that Mr. Cohen has aggressively protested.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gutes Guterman sat on an antique French farm bench in Pig Bar, a craft beer shop overlooking the scene-y slice of Lower Manhattan known as Dimes Square. Reaching for a gherkin, her hand in a lacy fingerless glove, she paused to gesture toward the former site of the Drunken Canal newspaper box.
"If you know, you know," she said.
It was a cool spring day, and Ms. Guterman, 26, was here to talk about her latest editorial venture: Byline, a website that went live on Thursday.
But first she had to address the end of her analog publication, The Drunken Canal, a print-only newspaper meant for people who have "made out at Clandestino," as Ms. Guterman put it in a TikTok video, referring to a bar at the center of the scene.
Ms. Guterman and a friend, Claire Banse, started the paper mid-lockdown. During its nearly two-year run, the unmarked box near Seward Park was frequently restocked to meet demand for what became a sort of downtown vade mecum. Cheeky and cryptic, it ran headlines like "Basic Things to Try This Fall (Based on Your Level of Depression)" and "New York Men You Will Ghost -- as Chocolates."
The writer Dean Kissick, a contributor to The Drunken Canal, summed up the ethos surrounding the publication in a 2020 tweet: "On 6th street around 11 last night we passed a girl kneeling on her stoop, facing the railings, reading a copy of the Drunken Canal with no socks on."
There were stickers: "Don't read The Drunken Canal. CALL YOUR MOM!" Vogue called it "downtown New York's paper of record for gossip." The Cut said it was an "unfiltered antidote to the careful, conservative vibe" that had become prevalent on the two founders' social media feeds.
"Not being online was important at that time," Ms. Guterman said, contemplating a charcuterie board. "We wanted to make something you could touch at a time when you weren't supposed to touch anything." She paused for prosciutto. "The fact that it was offline was a product of its time, as opposed to, like, a philosophy of living."
The final issue ran in November. In March, the paper told its 17,000 Instagram followers that The Drunken Canal had been part of a sociological study conducted by Harvard University (it wasn't really) and, also, to stay tuned for a sequel (really).
Getting a Byline
"A sequel, but not necessarily Part 2," is how Ms. Guterman described Byline at Pig Bar, a recently opened pub with studded leather floors, cured meats, Amish butter, Sabrett hot dogs, something with quinoa called a Dream Bowl and miscellaneous essentials like Visine eye drops and Camel Blues.
"The Drunken Canal was an amazing thing, but Byline is bigger," she said. "The big sister. No. Not the big sister. An aunt."
Over locally brewed raw honey ale, Ms. Guterman and her Byline co-founder, Megan O'Sullivan, 30, spoke of "creating a universe of content."
The new publication will be "unbridled" and "niche," Ms. Guterman said, giving the example of an article headlined "Monogamy in This Economy?," which proposes polyamory as a financial coping mechanism. Other potential rubrics include "Heel Hunter," an analysis of crowdsourced foot photos, and "Hot Girl Lit," a catalog of "hot writers."
Ms. O'Sullivan broke off a piece of Parmesan and described the void they planned to fill. What young writers need, she said, is "a place that feels informal and fun and champions the individual."
A regular contributor to The Drunken Canal, Ms. O'Sullivan -- Texas-born, categorically sweet -- credited the paper with jump-starting her freelance writing career at i-D, GQ and Vogue.
"The problem is that the individual still needs a platform to reach people," she said.
Ms. Guterman and Ms. O'Sullivan have assembled an advisory board that includes: Ben Dietz, a former longtime executive at Vice Media; Taj Alavi, the head of marketing at Spotify; and Trevor McFedries, creator of the robot pop star Lil Miquela. Madeline Montoya, an art director at Bloomberg Businessweek, is working as Byline's creative director.
In phone interviews, Ms. Montoya and Mr. Dietz said the site would resist easy categorization.
"It's easy to say it's a digital magazine, but -- this sounds silly -- I almost don't want to call it anything," Ms. Montoya said. "Everything's on the table."
Mr. Dietz talked about "fungibility," noting that it won't be restricted to text. "Think of a byline metaphorically," he said.
Byline, which shares in the same upstart spirit that gave rise to indie publications of previous generations (think: Spy, Might, Gawker), is making its debut at a terrible time in the digital media business. Millions of dollars from investors looking to cash in on the next big thing could not prevent Vice from filing for bankruptcy last month. Shortly before that, Vox and Insider laid off significant numbers of employees, and BuzzFeed shut down its news division.
"It's harder than ever if you're a young writer today," said Taylor Lorenz, who covers online culture for The Washington Post and has signed on as an adviser for Byline. "If you're starting out, who do you pitch for? There's no one left."
Ms. Lorenz, a former New York Times reporter who is writing a column for Byline, roll-called a number of defunct or diminished sites: "There was this middle ground when I was coming up -- xoJane, Jezebel, Rookie Mag, Hello Giggles, Man Repeller -- these midlevel media outlets where you could get your feet wet."
"It's all gone," she said, "and no one has built anything to replace it."
Ms. Guterman seemed unfazed. "Byline really feels like right time, right place," she said in a text on the day that Paper magazine laid off its staff and ceased publication. "It's like we're walking into a graveyard and building a bar."
'Love'
The idea of "fun" came up a lot during an April video call with the Byline design team.
"Do we want to have a fun mouse?" Ms. O'Sullivan asked.
Ms. Montoya said the site has enough "hee-hee" elements.
Ms. Guterman wanted the interface to be "sealed with a wink," she said, without being "something you need to wink about." Nothing "too doodle-y," she added, though there should be "some squiggles somewhere."
Chris Oka, a programmer, was asked if it would be possible to "make the hamburger something cuter than a hamburger" ("hamburger" being coder-speak for the navigation menu icon that is traditionally three stacked lines).
"Can it be an actual hamburger?" Ms. Guterman asked.
"I like the idea of, once in a while, you go to a story and it's like ... leaning," Ms. Montoya said, sharing her screen with the group to show a visual asset tipping over.
"Love," Ms. O'Sullivan said.
"And you're like ... why?" Ms. Montoya explained.
"I love that," Ms. Guterman said.
Mr. Oka suggested tilt-optional settings for users to input desired degree of image crookedness.
Sections needed streamlining. Should "On the Rise" be part of "Culture"? "Libations" gave Ms. O'Sullivan pause. She said, "If 'Libations' is in 'Culture,' and a lot of libation content is New York-based, then the question is: What is 'Culture' versus 'New York'?"
Ms. Guterman parsed it: "'Culture' is when it's, like, 'Absolut Vodka dropped a new flavor!' But 'New York' is when it's, like, 'New hot dog dropped at Parcelle!"'
Byline isn't a site for hard news. Ms. O'Sullivan said, "It's just like: 'Hey, what's up? I woke up this morning."'
Still, they have standards. Their submission inbox gets "a lot of rambling," Ms. Guterman said.
"Someone will email, 'I want to write about all of my boy troubles,"' she said. "And, well, maybe we don't really care about all your boy troubles." In that case, she said, they encouraged the writer to explore "boy troubles at large."
'Girlboss Juice'
On a hot May afternoon, the co-founders were talking corporate sponsorship over white wine, Diet Coke and mixed nuts at the Chelsea hotel. For now, contributors to Byline will be unpaid, but Ms. Guterman and Ms. O'Sullivan said they had been in talks with possible sponsors including the furniture company Knoll, the astrology app Co-Star and the kink-friendly dating app Feeld.
Wearing an emerald maxi dress and nude Gucci slides, Ms. Guterman clapped her hands. "We had a come-to-Jesus moment," she said. "We got rid of banner ads. I don't want to go on this gorgeous website and see banner ads."
"Eww," said Ms. O'Sullivan, who was wearing a big blazer and wide legged jeans.
The Drunken Canal didn't make money. It did, however, get the nutrition shake company Soylent to pay for a trip to Art Basel in Miami.
"It's kind of a muddled story," Ms. Guterman said of her fleeting relationship with the meal replacement company. "Basically, Claire and I wanted to go to Basel," she continued, referring to Claire Banse, the paper's co-founder. "I was like, 'Let's pretend Tesla flew us out.' Claire was like, 'No, no, let's pretend Soylent flew us out."'
Soylent struck Ms. Guterman as reachable. "I was like, 'I feel like I could get to Soylent,"' she said. Four hours later, she recalled, she was in a group chat with the company's founder, Rob Rhinehart.
"I said, 'I have an idea for you: Girlboss Juice. Soylent caters to your incel man on a computer, but Claire and I are going to Art Basel. We're not going to have time to eat. We're going to be running around to all these art fairs. We'll shill Soylent as "Girlboss Juice" to a whole new audience that doesn't believe Soylent works, and you'll fly us out to Basel.' They were like, 'We're in."'
Ms. O'Sullivan chimed in: "It honestly was how I became aware of Soylent."
The untapped market of the Clandestino cognoscenti watched on Instagram as the women chased shots with Soylent at Miami's hottest parties. Ms. Guterman recalled a DM from a friend who said he had started dreaming about Soylent.
"Synergy," Ms. Guterman said, is key. "The future of advertising is letting creatives be creative."
She also noted that she didn't want Byline to be "so digital." To keep the clunky charm of print and the deadline rush that she knew from her Drunken Canal experience, Byline will come out in "drops" -- a big dispatch at the top of the month, followed by weekly "trickles."
Issue 1 has 75 contributors from Seoul to San Diego ranging in age from 12 to 40-something. An article highlighted on the home page, written by Ms. Guterman, is headlined "Who Builds the Internet? Meet Wikipedia's Architects." Other pieces include a story on the rise of the selfie by Ms. Lorenz, and an installment of the Teenage Diaries column, "You Went to Prom, and Heaven Knows You're Miserable Now."
In search of child writers before the debut, Byline asked on Instagram: "Is your kid a genius?" Alas, Henry Jones, who turned 12 this week, is writing the column "Give the People What They Want." The title, he said, comes from the 1997 movie "Tomorrow Never Dies." It's what James Bond says before killing the bad guy with a petroleum drill. The line is apt for Byline "because the villain was like a big old media mogul," Henry explained in a phone interview, "so ... yeah."

Full text: I called him Cup Guy because in every photo on his dating profile, he held a cup. Last Pride month, our relationship fizzled. Five months later, I watched him kiss someone new at "our" bar in the West Village. During the kiss, Cup Guy's eyes were locked on mine. I couldn't look away. Later, I saw him order two vodka-Cokes, probably for himself and his date. Surprise: He sauntered to my table. "Take it," he said, grinning, sliding a drink over, before leaving abruptly. I stared at this cup, wondering if it was a peace offering or an invitation. Dillon Fernando

Freed Bodies in a Place of Confinement: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: An arts program in a California state facility disproves the idea that "nobody dances in prison," encouraging inmates to channel their lives and emotions into movement.
Think of men in prison and you probably don't think of dancing. But that's what some at the California Institution for Men here were doing -- dancing for invited guests.
It might not have seemed like much: some walking, some running, a bit that resembled Duck Duck Goose. Yet the men were moving freely in an environment that restricts and regulates motion. They were moving together, suddenly vulnerable, physically open, trusting -- in ways that regular prison culture and the lives that led them to prison had taught them not to be. The dance was allowing the men to be seen, and to see themselves, differently.
The performance was the graduation ceremony for a new program called Embodied Narrative Healing, a class that is at once representative of changing norms in American prisons and quite unusual. From one angle, it's part of a nationwide effort to turn away from retribution and punishment toward rehabilitation and healing, sometimes through the arts. In California, after a funding drought in the 2000s, arts programs in prisons have been expanding since 2013, with programs in all state facilities since 2017.
What makes the class unusual is dance, which is much rarer than visual arts, theater and music in prison arts programs. One reason, offered by some of the men in Chino, is that dance goes against prison-culture codes of masculine behavior.
Amie Dowling, a choreographer and professor at the University of San Francisco with more than 20 years of experience working in prisons, pointed to another possibility. "Dance has a sense of liberation and agency," she said, and this can be threatening to "systems of control and containment, like prisons."
Yet the men in prison in Chino were dancing. How this came to be was both a consequence of shifting ideas about which opportunities should be offered to people in prison and a bit of an accident. Among those surprised by the changes were the two men who initiated the dance program from the inside and the French choreographer who was their unlikely collaborator.
"NOBODY DANCES IN PRISON." That's how Kenneth W. Webb recalled responding to his friend Dimitri Gales's suggestion that they start a dance class.
They were incarcerated at California State Prison, Los Angeles County, in the desert city of Lancaster. In 2008, when Webb was 17, he shot and killed an 18-year-old after a party. He was convicted of first degree murder and premeditated attempted murder and sentenced to 50 years to life. Gales was 19 in 2011 when he was involved in a gang shooting during which someone was injured (not by Gales). Convicted of attempted voluntary manslaughter, he was sentenced to 18 years to life.
By 2018, Webb and Gales were living on Yard A, the Progressive Programming Facility, where prisoners in the maximum security section earn admission through good conduct and gain access to rehabilitative classes.
Gales, who also goes by Buddha and is a brother of the rapper YG, was trying to teach a friend a dance called the Reject when he got the idea to start a class. "It sounded super crazy," he said, but he convinced Webb to join him and the two wrote a proposal emphasizing dance as rehabilitation. To their surprise, the proposal was approved.
They taught the class themselves, working out routines to hip-hop and R&B tracks for about 20 other inmates. This provoked jokes on the yard about twerking and "the skinny jean crew." But Gales was undeterred.
"We were going against a whole culture that defines dance as weak, like that's not what men do," he said. "People think we're thugs, but it's like 'No, bro, I'm really a regular person, and this is what I like doing."'
Gales and Webb were also taking other classes. Some were organized by Bidhan Chandra Roy, an English professor at California State University, Los Angeles, who had been so moved by inmates' stories that the mission of getting them out to the world had nearly taken over his life.
Words Uncaged, an organization Roy founded in 2015, borrows techniques from narrative therapy (helping participants reflect critically on their life stories) and applies them to the aims of restorative justice (repairing harm) in several Southern California prisons.
Many prison art classes are funded by the state through the California Arts Council. But hundreds more programs, like those of Words Uncaged, are run by volunteers and funded by private donations. These are often affiliated with institutions like universities, which provide subsidies and the kind of endorsement that helps gain approval from wardens.
Words Uncaged spreads the writing and art generated in its classes through publications and exhibits. It had nothing to do with dance until Gales and Webb asked Roy to find them a teacher. "They wanted a hip-hop person," Roy said. "But that would have just reinforced all the stereotypes we're trying to get away from." So instead, Roy brought them Dimitri Chamblas.
CHAMBLAS WAS FAMILIAR with places where adult men don't dance. He was born in one: a village in the French Alps. When some male ballet dancers from nearby Lausanne, Switzerland, visited his parents, he was fascinated by their globe-trotting lifestyle. He started taking dance classes in his village, the only boy, and when he was 10 left his family and home to attend the school of the Paris Opera Ballet.
At 15, he transferred to the contemporary dance department of the National Conservatory in Lyon, where he became friends with later-to-be-famous classmates Benjamin Millepied and Boris Charmatz. As soon as Chamblas and Charmatz graduated, in 1992, they choreographed a rough-and-tumble duet called "Á Bras-le-Corps," which they still perform.
Their goal was to break the rules they had been taught -- about concealing weight, fatigue and the sounds of effort. What Chamblas learned from this work, he said, was the importance of context. In one part, he rolled and sat on Charmatz's passive, floor-bound body. This was a formal idea: one body active, the other inactive. But when they danced it at a symposium about AIDS/H.I.V., it became about the living and the dead.
Skip through Chamblas's successful career as a dancer, choreographer and producer to 2017, when he moved to Los Angeles to become dean of the school of dance at the California Institute for the Arts. In 2019, at Roy's urging, Chamblas met with Webb and Gales and a few other inmates at Lancaster prison and jumped right into movement exercises in the mode of "Á Bras-le-Corps" -- the inmates sharing weight with their eyes closed, trying to dance big in a small room.
After that session, the men spontaneously started telling Chamblas their stories. He was so affected by their openness that he wanted a reason to keep returning. He came up with a long-term goal: A class of 10 would create a dance with him and put on a show for visitors. It was provisionally scheduled for April 2020.
THE PROSPECT OF THIS SHOW is what brought me to Lancaster prison in March of that year. Chamblas had told me that his weekly class was precarious, sometimes canceled at the last minute because the prison was on lockdown for one reason or another. But on the day of my visit, my security clearance checked out and my clothes didn't break any of the rules, so Chamblas and I were escorted through a series of double gates and across the sun-baked yard into the education building.
After all that control and surveillance, all this carceral choreography, I was surprised that Chamblas and I were left alone with the participants in a classroom like you might find at an underfunded community college. Everyone greeted Chamblas with hugs.
The men introduced themselves to me with their names and how many years they had been incarcerated, most in the 10 to 20 range. When I asked if Chamblas's idea of dance was what they had been expecting, everyone answered at once: "No!"
That released an explosion of laughter. Later, I would watch them gamely and creatively respond to Chamblas's French-accented prompts to stay physically connected to one another without using their hands or to let vibrations inside their bodies expand outward. If hip-hop dancing had met ridicule on the yard, these exercises were even riskier.
Chamblas was pushing them, as Albert Jerome Beckley Jr. put it, "totally out of our comfort zone," and they were grateful. What they most wanted to discuss was how the dance class, along with other Words Uncaged classes, had already changed them.
"We were hardcore gang members," said Beckley, who is serving a 50 years to life sentence for murder in a drive-by shooting. "But I've been able to find myself, and I like myself better now."
Beckley compared the class to a test. Daring to dance provoked taunts from other inmates, but where before he might have responded with violence, now he laughed it off. "If you can make it in this class, you have no fear of what anybody else thinks of you," he said. "That's proof of rehabilitation right there."
Some of this language could sound like a rehearsal for the parole board. But Webb, who talks like a philosopher and was not the only one to describe himself as shy, also spoke about the class as an extension of a community they were building to challenge the culture of prison and create "beacons of positivity." Now inmates not in the class were asking how they might join.
"It's the hope that we have," Rashan Greene, another class member, said. "They want that."
Words Uncaged classes had taught the men how to analyze their feelings; the effect of Chamblas's class was physical. "We know we can be aggressive," Beckley said, "but we had to dig deep into emotions that we have suppressed for so long. Sympathy, fear, sadness. And when I started embracing those emotions, my movements became more fluid. I was doing things I never thought I could do. I was superfly."
The dance work the men were creating with Chamblas borrowed choreography from their life in prison -- the freezing on the floor when an alarm sounds, the periodic roll call. Sometimes they recited barbed phrases from their pasts, like "You are irredeemable." But even the running and stopping, as in a game of Simon Says, and the carrying of one another was colored by the context.
Flickering between ordinary and extraordinary, this dance might have made for a powerful performance. But a few days later, the whole project entered a stage of seemingly perpetual postponements, as the prison locked down in response to a threat outside its walls: a global pandemic.
IN APRIL 2020, Gales told me over the phone how he and his classmates, now confined to their cells most of the day in the prison version of quarantine, continued working on dance moves that would fit those constricted spaces. "We really wish we could do TikTok," he said. "We would take over the world."
That June, Webb told me that he and Gales could now sometimes dance together on the yard. He was also allowed to visit the art room, and throughout the year, some of his paintings were exhibited in Los Angeles galleries and online. His mother, Gina, responded to his art with amazement. "This is his pain that I have never seen," she said.
Through 2020 and much of 2021, plans to restart the dance class kept being canceled. One by one, most members of the group were transferred to other prisons. Because of Webb's record of good behavior, he was moved to the lower-security facility in Chino. Gales, whose sentence had been commuted by the governor of California in recognition of the work he had done to transform himself, was released on parole in April 2022.
In Chino, Webb asked Roy and Chamblas to restart the dance class there. In fall 2021, they did, this time teaching the course together. The focus shifted more to trauma and how it lives in the body. Chamblas recalled doing a trust exercise with a new student, who was supposed to close his eyes as Chamblas took his weight.
"His body felt super agitated," Chamblas said, "and afterward, he said his body wanted to beat me." The exercise had released a repressed memory of childhood abuse.
During a class I visited in September 2022, several men spoke of having been abused and of their discomfort with physical contact. "I couldn't handle anybody touching me," Thomas Bolin said. Convicted of murder in 1981, he had been a member of the Aryan Brotherhood for more than 40 years, violently enforcing racial divisions in San Quentin and other prisons.
Bolin said that after making a promise to his wife while she was dying of cancer, he had enrolled in several rehabilitative programs. "But this is my No. 1," he said. "It teaches you to have empathy for yourself, as well as others."
"I still get angry," he added, but he described incidents on the yard "where the Tommy of a year ago would've put hands on somebody, and now I walk away." Duane West, a Black classmate, said that he and Bolin now have a "strong bond" and hang out together in public.
Bolin tearfully read aloud a letter addressed to his wife, reaffirming his promise. And then he put hands on his classmates, most of them Black or Latino -- lifting them, cradling them, letting them put their hands on him.
LAST NOVEMBER, the long-delayed show finally happened. The only original member performing was Webb, but among the 40 or so invited guests who filed into the Chino prison gym, was another: Gales. Looking a little stunned, he called it "a full-circle moment."
Although the performance was titled "Transformation," much of it appeared mundane. Yet because these men were inmates wearing orange jumpsuits labeled "prisoner," their walking past one another, occasionally jostling, took on an all-too-believable threat of violence. Similarly, the sight of a man running in big circles had a special impact in a place where such fast, free motion is normally against the rules.
Every time the men touched one another or carried one another, they seemed to defy the environment where such expressions of trust and tenderness are rare, even dangerous. This had a brave beauty.
After the performance, the men gathered with visitors and read aloud from the thoughtful, emotionally exposed writing they had done for the class. Visitors learned that some had been imprisoned for crimes (serious, terrible ones) committed when they were barely adults, and that some (like Bolin) were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. The men spoke about their families, their regrets and how they had been working hard to change. Inmates cried. Listeners too.
What kind of transformation was this? The effects of prison arts programs can be hard to measure, but a 2021 report by California Arts in Corrections summarized findings about how such programs help participants learn coping skills and heal from trauma, reduce anxiety and anger, form communities within the isolation of incarceration and reintegrate with their communities on the outside after release.
Brant Choate, the director of rehabilitative programs for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said that while "there is no special sauce for keeping people out of prison," arts programs "create a neutral zone" in places where people are usually divided by race or gang affiliation. And in that neutral zone, Choate said, they can change.
For Denise Herz, a criminology professor at Cal State Los Angeles, the healing-centered approach of Words Uncaged allows inmates "to create a new narrative of who they are and how they want to give back," she said. "Accountability turns into advocacy."
None of the more than 100 Words Uncaged participants who have been released from prison have been reincarcerated, Roy said. Many counsel young people. Webb said that this was his post-prison dream: "I can talk to kids. I can be of service."
But Dowling, the University of San Francisco professor, made a different point. "Why are we surprised there's talent and imagination?" she asked. "We've been fed so much misinformation about people in prison. The rehabilitation is reciprocal, really. We on the outside need it too."
In the parking lot after the show, Chamblas looked a little wistful. Earlier, he had told me about being in Paris, directing a fashion video for Chanel, and flying back in the middle of the shoot so he wouldn't miss the weekly class at the prison. "These are the best people I know in L.A.," he said.
Gales told me of his plans to break into the movie and fashion business and said he spent a lot of time with Chamblas's family. ("That's my boy, I'm always at his house.")
As I drove away, the image from the performance that replayed in my mind was of the man running in circles. Inside the prison, the freedom of that simple motion had felt shocking, and now the meaning rippled outward. The man was Webb. He is eligible for parole in 2031.

Reviving the Erotic Thriller: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Over-the-top locations and characters bathed in red light recall an all but dead genre that was once a staple of late-night cable: the erotic thriller.
A slick executive drives a cherry red convertible.
A nightclub owner carries a coke spoon and wears his hair in a rat tail.
A troubled pop star masturbates while choking herself.
Those images might have come from an erotic thriller made by Brian De Palma, Paul Verhoeven or Adrian Lyne, directors who were prominent in the 1980s and 1990s thanks to movies like "Body Double" (Mr. De Palma), "Basic Instinct" (Mr. Verhoeven) and "9 ½ Weeks" (Mr. Lyne).
But those scenes were actually part of "The Idol," the HBO series that made its debut on Sunday with the apparent intention of reviving an all but dead genre.
Filled with close-up shots of luxury goods and body parts, "The Idol" also recalled the works of lesser filmmakers whose R-rated creations populated the late-night lineups of HBO and its rivals long before the advent of prestige television.
It was a style that died out over the years -- the death blow might have been Mr. Verhoeven's infamous "Showgirls," an expensive 1995 flop -- and seemed highly unlikely to make a return to the cultural stage amid the #MeToo movement.
As Karina Longworth, the creator of the film-history podcast "You Must Remember This," recently observed, today's films are so devoid of steamy sex scenes that they "would pass the sexual standard set by the strict censorship of the Production Code of the 1930s."
The old aesthetic was on full display in the first moments of "The Idol," a series created by Sam Levinson, Abel Tesfaye (known as the Weeknd) and Reza Fahim, three men who came of age when flipping through cable channels late at night was a frequent pastime for adolescent boys.
The first episode begins with the pop star Jocelyn, played by Lily-Rose Depp, baring her breasts during a photo shoot as a team of handlers, crew members and an ineffectual intimacy coordinator look on.
Later, Ms. Depp's character smokes in a sauna, rides in the back of a Rolls-Royce convertible and rubs up against a man she has just met (a club owner portrayed by Mr. Tesfaye) on a dance floor bathed in smoky red light. There will be no flannel PJs for Joss; a pair of wake-up scenes make it clear to viewers that she sleeps in a thong.
It isn't only the show's gratuitous nudity that harks back to Mr. Lyne and company, but the overall look and mood, which recall a louche glamour from the time of boxy Armani suits and cocaine nights. A main setting is a $ 70 million mansion in Bel Air that looks like something out of Mr. De Palma's "Scarface" but is in fact Mr. Tesfaye's real-life home.
A number of young viewers have said they find sex scenes embarrassing, but Mr. Levinson, who created the HBO drama "Euphoria," and his fellow producers have made no secret of their desire to pay homage to the heyday of Cinemax (when it had the nickname Skinemax).
A wink to viewers comes when Joss, in the darkness of her private screening room, watches "Basic Instinct." And then there is the pulsating score, which seems to conjure Tangerine Dream, the German electronic group who scored the sex scene on a train in "Risky Business." In another nod to the show's influences, the cast includes Elizabeth Berkley, the star of "Showgirls."
While it may seem like an outlier, "The Idol" has seemingly tapped into a cultural moment that would have seemed unthinkable just a few years ago: Ms. Longworth recently devoted a season of her film-history podcast to the "Erotic '80s"; no less a tastemaker than the Criterion Channel has recently presented a series on erotic thrillers from the same time period; and last month in Los Angeles, the American Cinematheque held a screening of "Basic Instinct."
"The Idol" also has a close competitor in the world of streaming: "Fatal Attraction," a 1987 hit for Mr. Lyne, has been rebooted as a series on Paramount+.
Stephanie Zacharek, the film critic for Time, suggested that the return of such fare may have arisen from the yearslong glut of comic book movies, along with the lack of a certain kind of R-rated film that was once all the rage for adult viewers.
"In the '80s, that's almost all there was in the multiplex," Ms. Zacharek said. "Grown-ups went to see those movies. Now we don't even have that many movies for grown-ups, period."
Ms. Zacharek slammed "The Idol" in her review and in a phone interview -- "It feels like it was made by someone who has never had sex," she said -- but she said she was a fan of "Body Double" (and even "Showgirls") and laments the disappearance of that kind of thing.
"I always enjoyed those films, even when I thought they were sexist or ridiculous," Ms. Zacharek said. "They do have a certain element of glamour to them."
It is a distinct possibility that the idea of reviving this particular genre may appeal more to Mr. Levinson and his colleagues than audiences and critics.
After a two-decade absence from big-budget productions, Mr. Lyne attempted a comeback last year with "Deep Water," an erotic thriller starring Ana de Armas and Ben Affleck. Mr. Levinson was one of the film's writers.
"Deep Water," which streamed on Hulu upon its release, was never shown in theaters. It drew a 36 percent approval score from critics and a 24 percent audience score on the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes.
"The Idol" has fared both better and worse: A mere 24 percent of critics have given it a thumbs-up, and 63 percent of audience members have weighed in favorably.

Navigating a Landscape Filled With Vipers: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ben Kingsley plays Salvador Dalí, the man and the mustachioed myth, as he contends with his demanding wife and the far more voracious art world.
One of the best things about "Dalíland," Mary Harron's amused and amusing fictional look at the singular Salvador Dalí, is that it isn't a cradle-to-grave exhumation. Instead, the movie focuses on a period in Dalí's later years when he was widely, wrongly and seemingly permanently eclipsed both by the commercial profile of his art and by the flamboyant scandal he had made of his life. Harron's result is less a consummate portrait and more a distillation of a sensibility, as if she had dropped Dalí in an alcohol still to extract his very essence.
The man, the myth and the mustache are all here, albeit modestly. Harron's path into Dalí's world is through an invented character, James (the newcomer Christopher Briney), who's recently landed a job at the artist's New York gallery. An anodyne pretty boy, James serves as a proxy for the viewer, a wide-eyed tourist in a seductively foreign land. He enters partly by chance, although his looks and good timing help: Dalí (Ben Kingsley), who's struggling to produce sufficient new work for an upcoming show, recruits James as an assistant, ushering him into the frantic, at times funny and often bleak bacchanalia of the movie's title.
Much of the story takes place in 1974, starting with one of Dalí's customary winter sojourns at the St. Regis Hotel in New York. There, in a spacious suite wreathed in cigarette smoke and throbbing with rock music, he and his formidable, sometimes terrifying wife, Gala (Barbara Sukowa), preside over a glittery circus that's populated by beautiful people and supplicating waiters, and watched over by Dalí 's longtime aide, Captain Moore (Rupert Graves). Amid the ostrich boas, flowing Champagne and lines of coke, the slack-jawed James meets hangers-on like Alice Cooper (Mark McKenna) as well as the artist's muse Amanda Lear (Andreja Pejic), and one exceedingly dull love interest, Ginesta (Suki Waterhouse).
James isn't all that interesting, either, and there's too much of him in the movie. This isn't Briney's fault; he's pleasant to look at, and he manages his transition from tourist to accidental Dalí-wood guide well enough. It's just that once Dalí and Gala swan in, they immediately and rightly become the only characters you want to spend time with. They're entertaining, for one, having long settled into roles that feed their public profiles and public relations: She's the money-grubbing dominatrix while he alternately cowers, begs for her attention and upstages her. The relationship provides tension and mystery that the well-matched Kingsley and Sukowa complicate with gargoyle masks and shocks of vulnerability.
The story -- the screenplay is by John C. Walsh -- follows James as he tumbles further and further down the curious Dalí-Gala rabbit hole. It's a predictable scene on one level, filled with writhing bodies, orgiastic evenings, pathological marital warfare and a great deal of tawdry art-world shenanigans. Considerably less obvious is Dalí and Gala's confounding union, which began in the 1920s. Harron fills in some of the couple's fascinating story largely through a few inventively staged flashbacks in which the old Dalí and James share the screen with the young Dalí (Ezra Miller, vivid and otherworldly in a small role) and Gala (Avital Lvova).
I wish "Dalíland" incorporated more of the young Dalí and Gala, partly because the images of the older Dalí physically transported into his memories are both visually striking and quietly touching. They also illustrate the centrality of time in Dalí's work, a theme encapsulated in his most popular painting, "The Persistence of Memory" (1931), of a clock melting like warm Camembert on a long-lashed human face. The flashbacks help establish the emotional and psychological foundation for the couple's relationship, one that's encapsulated by the sight of the young Dalí, having apparently just completed that early masterpiece, weepily burying his head in Gala's lap like a child. (The movie doesn't include any of Dalí's actual artworks.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Dalí and Gala's relationship mystified many people over many well-publicized tumultuous decades. The filmmaker Luis Buñuel, Dalí's old schoolmate and collaborator on the Surrealist classics "Un Chien Andalou" and "L'Age D'or," pointedly blamed Gala in his memoir "My Last Sigh" for the men's estrangement, calling her "a woman I have always tried to avoid." Buñuel's violent animus toward Gala (he wrote that he once physically attacked her) is startling, and it's hard to know how much of his loathing was inflamed by old-fashioned sexism. While "Dalíland" occasionally edges into caricature, its take on Gala's role in the marriage, her temperament and feverish attention to money is happily more complicated.
"We need money," the older Gala blurts out to the abashed Dalí during one bellicose confrontation over his lack of productivity, "money, money!" It's a comic-pathetic scene, and while it would be easy to turn Gala into the villain of this story, Harron never does. Gala may be outrageous and at times deeply unkind, but Dalí married her, stayed with her, painted her. And she isn't wrong: With their expensive habits and tastes, she and Dalí do need money to pay their bills, but also -- as this movie repeatedly reminds you -- "money, money, money" is what the far crueler, far greedier and far more destructive art world demands.

Energy Drinks Are Surging. So Are Their Caffeine Levels.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: More companies are pushing low-calorie, sugar-free beverages they say are healthy. Some servings have nearly the same level of caffeine as a six-pack of Coca-Cola.
It has been more than 25 years since Red Bull hit the market and introduced caffeinated energy drinks to the United States. While the company claimed its beverage would "give you wings," it never said it was actually good for people.
Yet as the energy drink market continues to grow rapidly, companies both new and old are trying to attract health-conscious customers with a wave of no-sugar, low-calorie drinks that claim to boost energy as well as replenish fluids with electrolytes and other ingredients.
The offerings include drinks from the popular brand Celsius, which has an investment from PepsiCo and uses the marketing line "Celsius Live Fit." It claims to be made with "healthier ingredients" like ginger, green tea and vitamins. Likewise, the influencer-backed Prime Energy is sugar-free and has electrolytes, a main ingredient in most sports drinks.
"All of them are zero sugar or zero calories," said Jim Watson, a beverage analyst at Rabobank, a bank based in the Netherlands with a focus on food and agriculture. He added that energy drink consumption had increased partly because of the decades-long move away from sugary soda. "They're going for the healthy image."
Even Gatorade, which has long marketed beverages to athletes hoping to replenish lost fluids or electrolytes after strenuous exercise, is jumping into the caffeine arms race. This year, Gatorade released Fast Twitch, a sugar-free beverage in flavors like Strawberry Watermelon and Cool Blue -- with caffeine levels equivalent to more than two cups of coffee.
This new focus has helped the energy drink market grow, with sales in the United States surging to $ 19 billion from $ 12 billion over the past five years, according to Circana, a market research firm.
Last year, PepsiCo paid $ 550 million for an 8.5 percent stake in Celsius. In May, Celsius said revenues were $ 260 million in the first quarter of this year, double what they were a year earlier. At that ferocious pace, revenues could cross $ 1 billion this year, increasing from $ 314 million just two years ago. Shares of Celsius have shot up to $ 144 a share from $ 69 a year ago. Likewise, the stock of the beverage company Monster Energy has increased 31 percent in the past year.
But there are concerns that drinks being pitched as healthy are resulting in children and teenagers consuming caffeine in unhealthy amounts.
In March, neon-colored Prime Energy cans began appearing in a lunchroom filled with fourth and fifth graders in the Wilmington public school district in Massachusetts. The popular drinks were released in January by the social media stars Logan Paul and Olajide Olayinka Williams Olatunji, better known as KSI.
For some young students, the Prime Energy drinks, which come in flavors like Strawberry Watermelon and Orange Mango, were delicious liquid gold.
"We even had entrepreneurs in fourth and fifth grade who were bringing them to school and selling them to other kids at lunch," said Rebecca Brown, the health services coordinator for the district.
But the eye-popping cans pack a serious punch. A 12-ounce can of Prime Energy contains 200 milligrams of caffeine. That's roughly equivalent to two Red Bulls, two cups of coffee or six cans of Coca-Cola.
Some schools in Britain and Australia have already banned the beverages. In the United States, federal regulations say schools cannot sell or provide caffeinated drinks to elementary or middle school students, although many schools do not restrict what students can bring from home.
"Not long after drinking them, the students showed up in the health office saying they didn't feel good and that their hearts were racing," said Ms. Brown, who inserted a note in the school's weekly email to parents saying the energy drinks should not be brought to school.
A 12-ounce can of Red Bull contains about 114 milligrams of caffeine -- more than three times the amount in a 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola. Prime Energy has more: 200 milligrams in each 12-ounce can. A 16-ounce can of Bang Energy Drink, the size typically sold in convenience stores, has 300 milligrams of caffeine.
In an email response to questions, representatives for Mr. Paul, the social media personality, and Prime Energy noted that the company's cans labeled the drink as "not recommended for children under 18." But parents and school officials are sometimes confusing the drink with Prime Hydration, a caffeine-free sports drink from the social media stars that is sold in bottles. That drink is also immensely popular, with more than $ 250 million in sales in its first year and customers waiting in line for hours to buy it at some grocery stores in Britain.
"Everybody thought Red Bull was the peak of caffeine in energy drinks," said Dr. Ryan Stanton, an emergency physician in Lexington, Ky., who said he saw patients, especially around finals weeks at local colleges, come in complaining about feeling anxious and experiencing racing heartbeats after consuming too much caffeine. "Now, some of these drinks have two or three times the level of caffeine as Red Bull."
Studies have shown that consuming caffeine may have health benefits, but that too much could result in cardiovascular and gastric issues. The Food and Drug Administration has investigated a handful of reports over the years involving people dying shortly after consuming energy drinks or five-hour energy shots. But the agency has never established a link between the two, a spokesman for the F.D.A. said in a response to emailed questions.
Adults are recommended to have no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day. Pediatricians recommend that youths ages 12 to 18 should not consume more than 100 milligrams of caffeine per day and that children under 12 should avoid caffeine completely.
Over the years, there have been efforts to increase government regulation of energy drinks and limit the caffeine allowed in beverages. Lawmakers in several states, including Indiana and Connecticut, have considered banning the sale of energy drinks to minors. But the industry has successfully pushed back, in part by arguing that young people can get caffeine from myriad sources, including soda and coffee. A 16-ounce cinnamon-caramel-cream cold brew from Starbucks, for instance, contains 265 milligrams of caffeine (not to mention 260 calories).
About a decade ago, the energy drink industry, through its lobbying arm, the American Beverage Association, voluntarily adopted a set of principles, including labeling the amount of caffeine in products and noting on packaging that the beverages were not recommended for children. The industry also agreed not to sell or market its products in schools.
But critics say some energy drinks are clearly marketed toward younger customers. Last year, the consumer advocacy group Truth in Advertising said companies like C4 Energy, which sells drinks in flavors like Starburst and Skittles, and Ghost Energy, which sells Sour Patch Kids and Swedish Fish-flavored drinks that contain more caffeine than two cups of coffee, were trying to appeal to minors.
Dan Lourenco, the chief executive and co-founder of Ghost, said in an email that the company's products were geared toward millennials seeking the nostalgic flavors of their youth. C4 Energy, which is owned by Nutrabolt, did not respond to an email seeking comment.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, whose Smart Snacks program creates the nutritional standards for foods and beverages sold in schools, said any products sold in elementary and middle schools must be caffeine-free. But for beverages sold in high schools, there are restrictions on the number of calories but none on the level of caffeine.
Moreover, the F.D.A. does not have specific regulations around "energy drinks," deeming it a marketing term. A spokesman for the agency added in an email that companies were still responsible for including a safe amount of caffeine in beverages.
Chloe Fitzgibbon, 17, who graduated in May from Lincoln Southeast High School in Lincoln, Neb., questioned whether the school cafeteria should be selling energy drinks in an article published last year on the website of the school's newspaper, The Clarion. Noting that the school sold Mountain Dew's version, Kickstart, Ms. Fitzgibbon said students opted for the drink not only for the energy jolt but for the ease of buying it through their student accounts.
The high school cafeteria sells a number of caffeinated beverages, including Kickstart, which has 68 milligrams of caffeine in a 12-ounce can, and Bubbl'r, a sparkling water with 69 milligrams of caffeine in a 12-ounce can. Mindy Burbach, a spokeswoman for Lincoln Public Schools, said in an email that students were limited to buying two caffeinated beverages each day.
"When I took an early-morning class, A.P. Psych, almost everyone came in with a coffee or they would buy the energy drinks that we sell at school," Ms. Fitzgibbon said.
Pasco County Schools, a Florida district just north of Tampa, also offers Kickstart drinks to high school students in its vending machines. But Stephen Hegarty, a spokesman for the district, noted that PepsiCo, which owns the brand, marketed the beverage as an "enhanced soft drink," not an "energy drink." PepsiCo declined to comment.
"If you go to any of our high schools, you'll see students walking in with Starbucks, and some of those drinks have a lot of caffeine," Mr. Hegarty said. "I'm not sure what the definition of an energy drink is these days."

Likewise, the influencer-backed Prime Energy is sugar-free and has electrolytes, a main ingredient in most sports drinks.
“All of them are zero sugar or zero calories,” said Jim Watson, a beverage analyst at Rabobank, a bank based in the Netherlands with a focus on food and agriculture. He added that energy drink consumption had increased partly because of the decadeslong move away from sugary soda. “They’re going for the healthy image.”
Even Gatorade, which has long marketed beverages to athletes hoping to replenish lost fluids or electrolytes after strenuous exercise, is jumping into the caffeine arms race. This year, Gatorade released Fast Twitch, a sugar-free beverage in flavors like Strawberry Watermelon and Cool Blue — with caffeine levels equivalent to more than two cups of coffee.
This new focus has helped the energy drink market grow, with sales in the United States surging to $19 billion from $12 billion over the last five years, according to Circana, a market research firm.
Last year, PepsiCo paid $550 million for an 8.5% stake in Celsius. In May, Celsius said revenues were $260 million in the first quarter of this year, double what they were a year earlier. At that ferocious pace, revenues could cross $1 billion this year, increasing from $314 million just two years ago. Shares of Celsius have shot up to $144 a share from $69 a year ago. Likewise, the stock of beverage company Monster Energy has increased 31% in the past year.
But there are concerns that drinks being pitched as healthy are resulting in children and teenagers consuming caffeine in unhealthy amounts.
In March, neon-colored Prime Energy cans began appearing in a lunchroom filled with fourth and fifth graders in the Wilmington public school district in Massachusetts. The popular drinks were released in January by social media stars Logan Paul and Olajide Olayinka Williams Olatunji, better known as KSI.
For some young students, the Prime Energy drinks, which come in flavors like Strawberry Watermelon and Orange Mango, were delicious liquid gold.
“We even had entrepreneurs in fourth and fifth grade who were bringing them to school and selling them to other kids at lunch,” said Rebecca Brown, the district’s health services coordinator.
But the eye-popping cans pack a serious punch. A 12-ounce can of Prime Energy contains 200 milligrams of caffeine. That’s roughly equivalent to two Red Bulls, two cups of coffee or six cans of Coca-Cola.
Some schools in Britain and Australia have already banned the beverages. In the United States, federal regulations say schools cannot sell or provide caffeinated drinks to elementary or middle school students, although many schools do not restrict what students can bring from home.
“Not long after drinking them, the students showed up in the health office saying they didn’t feel good and that their hearts were racing,” said Brown, who inserted a note in the school’s weekly email to parents saying the energy drinks should not be brought to school.
A 12-ounce can of Red Bull contains about 114 milligrams of caffeine — more than three times the amount in a 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola. Prime Energy has more: 200 milligrams in each 12-ounce can. A 16-ounce can of Bang Energy Drink, the size typically sold in convenience stores, has 300 milligrams of caffeine.
In an email response to questions, representatives for Paul, the social media personality, and Prime Energy noted that the company’s cans labeled the drink as “not recommended for children under 18.” But parents and school officials are sometimes confusing the drink with Prime Hydration, a caffeine-free sports drink from the social media stars that is sold in bottles. That drink is also immensely popular, with more than $250 million in sales in its first year and customers waiting in line for hours to buy it at some grocery stores in Britain.
“Everybody thought Red Bull was the peak of caffeine in energy drinks,” said Dr. Ryan Stanton, an emergency physician in Lexington, Kentucky, who said he saw patients, especially around finals weeks at local colleges, come in complaining about feeling anxious and experiencing racing heartbeats after consuming too much caffeine. “Now, some of these drinks have two or three times the level of caffeine as Red Bull.”
Studies have shown that consuming caffeine may have health benefits, but that too much could result in cardiovascular and gastric issues. The Food and Drug Administration has investigated a handful of reports over the years involving people dying shortly after consuming energy drinks or five-hour energy shots. But the agency has never established a link between the two, a spokesperson for the FDA said in a response to emailed questions.
Adults are recommended to have no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day. Pediatricians recommend that youths ages 12 to 18 should not consume more than 100 milligrams of caffeine per day and that children younger than 12 should avoid caffeine completely.
Over the years, there have been efforts to increase government regulation of energy drinks and limit the caffeine allowed in beverages. Lawmakers in several states, including Indiana and Connecticut, have considered banning the sale of energy drinks to minors. But the industry has successfully pushed back, in part by arguing that young people can get caffeine from myriad sources, including soda and coffee. A 16-ounce cinnamon-caramel-cream cold brew from Starbucks, for instance, contains 265 milligrams of caffeine (and 260 calories).
About a decade ago, the energy drink industry, through its lobbying arm, the American Beverage Association, voluntarily adopted a set of principles, including labeling the amount of caffeine in products and noting on packaging that the beverages were not recommended for children. The industry also agreed not to sell or market its products in schools.
But critics say some energy drinks are clearly marketed toward younger customers. Last year, the consumer advocacy group Truth in Advertising said companies like C4 Energy, which sells drinks in flavors like Starburst and Skittles, and Ghost Energy, which sells Sour Patch Kids and Swedish Fish-flavored drinks that contain more caffeine than two cups of coffee, were trying to appeal to minors.
Dan Lourenco, the CEO and co-founder of Ghost, said in an email that the company’s products were geared toward millennials seeking the nostalgic flavors of their youth. C4 Energy, which is owned by Nutrabolt, did not respond to an email seeking comment.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, whose Smart Snacks program creates the nutritional standards for foods and beverages sold in schools, said any products sold in elementary and middle schools must be caffeine-free. But for beverages sold in high schools, there are restrictions on the number of calories but none on the level of caffeine.
Moreover, the FDA does not have specific regulations around “energy drinks,” deeming it a marketing term. A spokesperson for the agency added in an email that companies were still responsible for including a safe amount of caffeine in beverages.
Chloe Fitzgibbon, 17, who graduated in May from Lincoln Southeast High School in Lincoln, Nebraska, questioned whether the school cafeteria should be selling energy drinks in an article published last year on the website of the school’s newspaper, The Clarion. Noting that the school sold Mountain Dew’s version, Kickstart, Fitzgibbon said students opted for the drink not only for the energy jolt but for the ease of buying it through their student accounts.
The high school cafeteria sells a number of caffeinated beverages, including Kickstart, which has 68 milligrams of caffeine in a 12-ounce can, and Bubbl’r, a sparkling water with 69 milligrams of caffeine in a 12-ounce can. Mindy Burbach, a spokesperson for Lincoln Public Schools, said in an email that students were limited to buying two caffeinated beverages each day.
“When I took an early morning class, AP Psych, almost everyone came in with a coffee or they would buy the energy drinks that we sell at school,” Fitzgibbon said.
Pasco County Schools, a Florida district just north of Tampa, also offers Kickstart drinks to high school students in its vending machines. But Stephen Hegarty, a spokesperson for the district, noted that PepsiCo, which owns the brand, marketed the beverage as an “enhanced soft drink,” not an “energy drink.” PepsiCo declined to comment.
“If you go to any of our high schools, you’ll see students walking in with Starbucks, and some of those drinks have a lot of caffeine,” Hegarty said. “I’m not sure what the definition of an energy drink is these days.”

The Republican Silly Season Has Begun: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Whenever I want to put myself to sleep at night, I run through the names of all the former vice presidents. OK, sorta peculiar. It might be time for a break. Maybe I'll just try making a list of Republican candidates for president.
Back when Donald Trump announced, it all seemed sorta life as usual, but now the race is definitely on. There are currently somewhere between 12 and 400 Republicans eyeing the White House.
All the major names are men, except Nikki Haley, who's arguing that "it's time to put a badass woman in the White House." Well, yeah. There's very little chance Haley's campaign is going anywhere, but I think we can all agree she could really perk things up.
We're also expecting some energy from the newly announced candidate Chris Christie. Rather than dodging the whole Donald Trump matter whenever possible, Christie stresses that he's running to save the country from a former close colleague who he now calls a "lonely, self-consumed, self-serving mirror hog."
And that's just the beginning! On Wednesday we acquired Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota. His great claim to fame is having built a software company that he sold for over $ 1 billion. Warning: Do not call Burgum a billionaire. ("Not even close!") He's really not into that. You'll hurt his feelings.
Vivek Ramaswamy doesn't have that problem, since he's reportedly worth only $ 600 million or so (biopharmaceuticals). Still, he's invested at least $ 10 million in the race so far, and it's gotten ... well, hey, we're talking about him.
Ramaswamy, who's 37, went to Harvard around the same time as Pete Buttigieg and has claimed that Buttigieg is "like the Diet Coke to my Coca-Cola." Where do you think he came up with that one? Feel free to discuss amongst yourselves.
OK, and let's see ... there's Perry Johnson. Ever heard of Perry Johnson? He did run for governor of Michigan last year but got thrown off the Republican primary ballot for invalid petition signatures. Which must have been a little embarrassing for someone who made his fortune building a firm that promises to help your company meet business quality standards.
Johnson used a pinch of his money running an ad during the Super Bowl celebrating, um, himself. ("Perry Johnson: Quality guru. Governor for a perfect Michigan.") Fans who lost interest in the game between the Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals were free to contemplate the suggestion that they give thanks to Johnson "when your car door closes just right."
Didn't work. But they do say he's a really great bridge player. Just remember him that way. Perry Johnson ... I bid two no-trump.
You don't need any government experience in your bio to be on the campaign trail. Ryan Binkley of Texas is out meeting and greeting in Iowa, and he's never done anything remotely like this before. Although he claims he started thinking about running for president around eight years ago. So it's not like he hasn't been mulling.
Binkley bills himself as a pastor and -- wait for the shock -- super fiscal conservative. He's also the chief executive and a co-founder of Generational Group, an investment banking firm that specializes in mergers and acquisitions.
Are you picking up on a theme here, people? We have a very crowded field of superrich candidates. (Don't call them billionaires!) And while sitting on piles of cash will not necessarily make you president, it sure does help open a lot of doors.
There actually are some candidates who don't seem to have a ton of money. We haven't gotten to Larry Elder, a California talk radio host who did very well against other Republicans in the Gov. Gavin Newsom recall election. Which was certainly a great triumph for Elder, except for the part about Newsom beating the entire recall idea back by a huge margin.
Or Asa Hutchinson, a 72-year-old former governor of Arkansas. OK, not necessarily a new broom. But you will so impress your friends when you say, "... And let's not forget about Asa Hutchinson."
I guess Senator Tim Scott really ought to be up higher. He is the best-known Black candidate in the field so far, and he is having adventures. Got into a fight on TV over Florida's "Don't Say Gay" bill, much to the audience's irritation. ("Do not boo. This is 'The View,"' urged Whoopi Goldberg.)
Mike Pence is a sorta interesting challenge. You will remember that when Trump lost the 2020 election, Pence had an allegedly ceremonial role in certifying the results. Which he did, guaranteeing a normal transfer of power and getting to hear the Jan. 6 crowd of rioters chanting, "Hang Mike Pence."
Should we be grateful? I mean, yeah, sure, when it comes to writing his obituary. But do you want to root for Pence this time around? He's extremely conservative, especially on social matters. ("Well, I think defending the unborn first and foremost is more important than politics. I really believe it's the calling of our time.")
Sigh. Will the Republican field get any bigger? Or is it going the other way? I was watching one of the TV news channels the other day, and suddenly a headline flashed:
"Breaking News: Sununu Passes on Presidential Campaign."
Yes -- shocker of the week! -- the governor of New Hampshire has decided he's not going to try for the nomination. Possibly the highest-ranking Republican in the country who definitely doesn't want to give it a shot.
Guess you'll all have to stop saying, "Yeah, but wait until Chris Sununu gets in there."

Hearing the Call To Place Music In a New Light: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The 23-year-old pianist, drummer and rapper puts a pandemic-era spin on jazz-rap on his debut, "More Better," and he always keeps the faith.
At a recent Sunday afternoon performance in Brooklyn's Clinton Hill neighborhood, the pianist Francisco Haye sat behind a piano at Emmanuel Baptist Church, leading his quintet through a number of recognizable jazz standards. Yet they weren't straight-ahead: Songs like "All the Things You Are," "Little Sunflower" and "My Favorite Things" each had wrinkles -- a bouncy backbeat or a near-frenetic breakdown -- that made them feel fresh.
It was the kind of set that might rankle those who prefer to hear Ella Fitzgerald, Freddie Hubbard and John Coltrane without frills, yet these listeners -- made up of elders who have known Haye since he was a child growing up in the congregation there -- seemed to embrace what he was trying to do.
The goal, he told them, was to take "cliché jazz tunes and not make them boring."
Haye's artistry is informed by artists like Robert Glasper and Roy Hargrove, both classically trained jazz musicians who have blended the genre with hip-hop, R&B and rock, aligning the music with alternative rap and the neo-soul movement that emerged in the late 1990s. Haye, performing under the name Cisco Swank, plays melodic piano chords over lush soul and trap-inspired drums and raps in a manner that recalls the weary lethargy of Mike and Earl Sweatshirt, but with the polish of a Village Vanguard headliner.
Jazz-rap hybrids aren't new, of course, but Haye, 23, without pandering to any audience, is tapping into a subset who dig lo-fi underground rap.
"He's sitting right in the center of a lot of points," said the noted trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire in a telephone interview. "And it doesn't seem like he's trying to. It's just who he is. He is Black music. All of it. It's in every note."
Haye runs through the tapestry of jazz, R&B and rap on his recently released debut album, "More Better," which at times ruminates on the pandemic but without wallowing in despair.
"Teary-eyed still thinkin' 'bout 2020/Quarantined, bro, the streets eerie," he raps on "If You're Out There." "City full of dreams, concrete, but I see it when I look in the sky." On "What Came From Above," over a melancholic piano loop and stuttering electronic drums, Haye admits he is "renewed" back at home with his family. (He returned to Crown Heights, Brooklyn, from the Berklee College of Music, where he studied piano performance and contemporary writing and production when the pandemic took hold.) On "Over Now," he laments the end of a romantic relationship with keen self-awareness. "I try to smile through it," Haye raps with an exhausted tone. "I don't really like fast moving/I try not to commit, bro, I'm last to it." Even the LP's title -- thought of randomly during a rehearsal -- is meant to convey perseverance in dark times.
Haye, tall and skinny with long dreads and a boyish charm, peppers his conversation with affirmations like "facts" and "fire," and speaks easily and expertly about a wide range of musicians -- Beethoven and Bach, Kirk Franklin and Richard Smallwood. While growing up in Flatbush, he was exposed to all of this music by his mother, Adriane, who directed the youth choir at Emmanuel, and his father, Frank, who was the director of music there.
Haye's earliest musical memories involve playing drums and piano at the church, when he was only 3 or 4 years old. Seeing his father in action in front of large congregations sparked a real interest in music. "I feel like it played an important role in how I see people present music and how you interact with people," he said during a lunch interview. "The whole idea of just music being more than just notes and harmony. It's serving a bigger purpose, whether it's bringing someone out of a wack week or bringing them closer to God."
At home, he said, there were "mad musical instruments everywhere," which made being an artist seem like the coolest job ever. He absorbed Baroque music, Stevie Wonder and other Motown soul, as well as old-school rap. (His mother grew up in the Bronx at the beginning of hip-hop culture and used to rhyme under the name Micki Dee.)
Haye started thinking about blending genres during his freshman year at LaGuardia High School: His favorite rapper, Kendrick Lamar, merged rap and psychedelic jazz on his 2015 album "To Pimp a Butterfly," and Glasper's song "Portrait of an Angel" doubled as his alarm clock. "That really was the point where I was like, 'I'm trying to do something very much like this,"' Haye said.
He formed a jazz fusion band and started playing around the city. He began rapping as a student at Berklee, tinkering with the conversational cadences heard on "More Better" while releasing music on SoundCloud. "I was like, 'Oh, maybe we should just play this song with the band but put a trap groove over it,"' Haye recalled. "Slowly, it just started merging into what it is today."
He met the Chicago-based multi-instrumentalist Luke Titus over social media at the start of lockdown in 2020 and started sharing audio files with him, which led to the collaborative album "Some Things Take Time," released two years later. "The narrative was definitely about being patient during a time with so much uncertainty," Titus said over the phone. "It was about not forcing things and allowing things to come when they come." Those themes are also relayed on "More Better" in Haye's singular voice.
"He draws from so much influence of being from New York," Titus added, pointing to the city's renowned jazz and rap scenes. "He might have all these jazz chops, but he'll pick the simple melody and play what needs to be there in a very lyrical way." He added, "He's one of those rare guys who doesn't overthink things too much."
Haye noted that while his album was born of the pandemic, it's rooted in a sense of uplift rather than resignation. "It's just like seeing the clouds in the distance, like seeing the light at the end of the tunnel," he said. "It's being able to say, 'Oh, I can make it as long as I have faith.' Even if it's not a spiritual faith, if it's just faith that things will get better, it will work out."

Will 'Succession' Get Its Ending Right?: [Op-Ed]

Author: Rebeck, Theresa

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The ending of "Succession" is upon us. So how to end this bitter masterpiece?
Do they shoot forward in time, stealing a page from the legendary finale of "Six Feet Under"? Maybe offer a glimpse of the future with that handsome sociopath and potential president they have put in power? Or just cut to black before someone assassinates Kendall? (I'm someone who actually liked the ending of "The Sopranos.")
Possible but not probable. None of those options feel quite right.
That's the thing about a good ending: It has to be both ineffable and organic. And unfortunately, a wrong-footed ending can virtually ruin an otherwise brilliant piece of art. The greatness of the astonishing "Game of Thrones" was severely undercut by too many missteps in its final episodes. Jaime goes back to Cersei and a house falls on them? The sublime and beloved Daenerys goes bonkers and burns down King's Landing? Bran gets the throne? What we want from an ending is a grand "amen," such as we got from "Breaking Bad." But "Game of Thrones" was more of a "huh?"
I've thought about endings a lot because I have to write them. While I usually have a vague idea of an ending when I start writing a play, I don't want everything set in stone. If you don't map the story out too ruthlessly, it will reveal itself to you in the writing -- and there is often a secret subject, something both surprising and inevitable that your mind was holding on to, that ultimately presents itself. Something perfect, like an angel crashing through the ceiling. Or "I have always depended on the kindness of strangers." Or the fact that there really is a cabal of devil worshipers living in the Dakota on the Upper West Side. Those are great endings.
The ending should grow out of everything that came before, but also be different from everything that came before. A great ending can be about transformation, in which our central character escapes, or finds true love, or discovers a profound truth and achieves inner wisdom (as in "Mad Men," except the profound truth was about Coca-Cola). Or it can be about justice, which rains down on those who deserve it and ruins those who don't. (See every superhero movie.) Or its opposite, the idea that justice has abandoned everyone. (See "The Godfather.") A good ending can involve a soft, mournful loss of hope. (See Chekhov.) It can celebrate the restored and renewed order that a marriage can provide to a disordered world. (See Shakespeare.) Or it can resolve with the notion that marriage is actually not going to solve anything. (Again, see Shakespeare.)
At its best, a sublimely written ending will raise everything that came before into the realm of timeless wisdom: "So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past," as the narrator of "The Great Gatsby" concludes.
Television offers different challenges -- and not just because the viewers will sit and stew for a week (or more) obsessing about how it all might end. Television is built differently from other kinds of drama, so naturally it ends differently, too.
You start with a pilot episode, which may or may not make it to air, and then you inchworm yourself through a first season. At that point the ending is so far off it's hard to take the idea of it seriously. After all, if no one watches, you'll just be canceled anyway. So you're not trying to imagine the ending -- you're trying to avoid it.
That's why truly great endings are especially hard to come by in television. TV shows are not about the ending; they're about the middle. They're about how long you can keep that show on the air. When you have a hit, generally no one is in a big hurry to get to the ending, which is why phrases like "jump the shark" have entered the lexicon. The middle is where television thrives.
For me, the ending of Season 2 of "Succession," when Kendall betrayed his father, Logan, to the world and threatened to bring the whole house of cards down on everyone's head, was perhaps the series's most spectacular moment. That whisper of a smile from Logan as he watched the catastrophe was mysterious, glorious and human. Did he secretly want Kendall to grab the reins? Perhaps so. It was undeniably great television. Then Logan went ahead and destroyed Kendall all over again in Season 3. And the show went back to the starting gate. There's a kind of circularity in TV that's inherent in the form. This is why so many shows end in what can only be called "the group hug." "Mary Tyler Moore" did it; "The Office" did it; "Seinfeld" did an incarcerated version of it.
I suspect that we are not getting a group hug out of "Succession."
As endings go, "Succession" is a special case, and not just because the creator Jesse Armstrong chose not only how to end the show, but also when. (He's said it has "been kind of present" in his mind from the very beginning.) With "Succession," the ending has always been built right into the title.
My bold prediction? I can tell you what won't happen: Logan won't come back to life. The children won't sell the company to someone who shows up suddenly from China with a better offer. It won't turn on a deus ex machina that shows up because nobody knew how to land the damn plane so they just brought in something from nowhere and that's the end.
As for what will happen, I feel confident in promising this: The ending of "Succession" will fulfill the story and not betray the spirit of what has come before. Its creators have proved over four seasons that they're better than that.
That's why I'll be tuning in. I can't wait to see how it ends.

Full text: The cash balance at the Treasury Department is now lower than the net worth of some of the world's richest people.
The Treasury Department said its cash balance fell to $ 38.8 billion as of Thursday, as the United States inched toward running out of cash to pay its bills.
That was significantly lower than the $ 316 billion the department had in operating cash, which is held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the start of the month.
Just how empty is the Treasury cash coffer? For comparison, $ 38.8 billion is on par with the gross domestic product of Bahrain and Paraguay and lower than the net worth of more than two dozen of the wealthiest people in the world. Of course, much of the assets of those billionaires are tied up in stocks, rather than liquid assets.
Here is a list of people with higher net worths than the U.S. cash reserves, according to Bloomberg News's Billionaire Index as of Thursday. (Under the news agency's editorial policy, its billionaire owner, Michael Bloomberg, is not considered for the index. Forbes, though, estimates his net worth at $ 94.5 billion.)
Bernard Arnault, chief executive of the luxury group LVMH: $ 189 billion
Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, Tesla and Twitter: $ 179 billion
Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon: $ 139 billion

Shermane Billingsley, 78; Guarded the Stork Club's Legacy for Nearly 6 Decades: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The nightspot her father opened as a Prohibition-era speakeasy endured as a Manhattan institution until 1965. For decades she was "the keeper of the flame."
Shermane Billingsley was barely 2 years old when the Broadway gossip columnist Dorothy Kilgallen revealed that Shermane was bedridden with a fever of 104. Less than a year later, Walter Winchell reported that Shermane had vamped to an inquiring columnist, "I will break your heart someday with my big blue eyes!"
She was still a tot when Johnny Weissmuller, the Olympic swimmer and movie Tarzan, was about to present her with a bunny on live television but froze; she filled the void by ad-libbing, "You know, my father once gave me two rabbits, and in a short time I had 200."
Shermane Billingsley, who died on April 16 in a Manhattan hospital, was the last living link to the storied Manhattan nightspot that made her such endearing fodder for the society pages, the Stork Club. She was the youngest daughter of its impresario, Sherman Billingsley, and after the club closed in 1965, she became the faithful guardian of its legacy for nearly six decades.
Her son Austin Billingsley Drill said she died of cancer at 78. The family delayed the announcement of her death until this month, he said, to give them time to mourn.
"She was the youngest of the three daughters and was the darling of the Stork Club," said Ralph Blumenthal, a former New York Times reporter and the author of "Stork Club: America's Most Famous Nightspot and the Lost World of Cafe Society" (2000). "She was the keeper of the flame."
Ms. Billingsley made her father's unpublished memoirs available to Mr. Blumenthal for his authoritative book. For years she reached out to publishers, documentarians and movie studios to keep the club's legacy alive, and even to restaurateurs to see if it could be resurrected.
The Stork Club opened in 1929, during Prohibition. It eventually fell victim to a prolonged strike and to diversions like television, as well as to the emergence of a go-go '60s generation that rejected the glamour of the cafe society that had thrived through the scarcity of the Depression and World War II and offered fairy-tale escape during the conformist, socially conservative 1950s.
Mr. Billingsley died of a heart attack in 1966, a year to the day after his club shut its doors.
"I was there when the Stork Club closed," Ms. Billingsley told The Times last year. "Everyone said it was the unions that caused its demise. But it was James Dean. It was black boots and jeans. It was the arrival of the new world."
The Stork Club was not the only famous nightclub in New York, but when it was in its heyday, in its several incarnations -- at 132 West 58th Street, 53½ East 51st Street and, for most of its existence, 3 East 53rd Street, off Fifth Avenue -- it was "New York's New Yorkiest place," as Walter Winchell called it in his syndicated column for The Daily Mirror. It was Winchell's preferred hangout and the full-time domain of Mr. Billingsley, a teetotaling former bootlegger from Oklahoma who managed to corral the likes of the mobster Frank Costello and the G-man J. Edgar Hoover to be his regular guests.
Mr. Billingsley insisted that he didn't remember how or why he chose the club's name. But, like a stork, it delivered.
"The Stork is the dream of suburbia," Lucius Beebe wrote in "The Stork Club Bar Book" (1946), "a shrine of sophistication in the minds of thousands who have never seen it, the fabric and pattern of legend."
The mirror above the bar, Mr. Blumenthal wrote, allowed the image-conscious patrons "to admire themselves and one another under softly flattering lights -- the ultimate entertainment at the Stork Club." From the bandstand, even the likes of Count Basie and Guy Lombardo couldn't compete.
Those reflections linger, at least in legend.
There is the anecdote about one of the first patrons, the writer Heywood Broun, who was said to have mistaken the club for a mortuary and, when he couldn't find the body to whom he had come to pay respects, settled at the bar instead.
There's the one about the time Ernest Hemingway scuffled with Lewis E. Lawes, the warden of Sing Sing.
And then there was the night a well-heeled customer gave the doorman a $ 1,000 tip and asked him if it was the largest tip he had ever received. "No," the doorman said, "I received a $ 2,000 tip about a year ago." The customer asked who had given it to him. The doorman replied, "You gave it to me."
A bar from one of the Stork Club's incarnations was said to have wound up at Jim Brady's, a pub in the financial district that closed at the start of the pandemic.
Mr. Billingsley worked 16-hour days and ran the club like a drill sergeant, but things didn't always run smoothly. He fought an epic, bitter battle with the restaurant workers' union (he wired the club's kitchen so that he could keep tabs on conversations there from high above in his seventh-floor apartment). He became embroiled in a civil-rights complaint when the Black entertainer Josephine Baker and her party complained that they were denied proper service at the club one night in 1951. And he was kidnapped by mobsters who were rivals to his Stork Club partners.
There was one unanticipated event he embraced blissfully. After he and his wife, Hazel (Donnelly) Billingsley, a former Ziegfeld Follies dancer, had two daughters (the second was 8), he was so sure his third child would be a son that he completed the birth certificate while his wife was in labor.
But when the baby turned out to be another daughter, born in Manhattan on Oct. 9, 1944, he edited the name from Sherman John to Shermane Joy.
Shermane grew up in the club. She celebrated birthdays there, starred with her father on the weekly "Stork Club Show" on television, and regularly occupied a seat at her family's reserved table.
"As a child, I lived in a number of apartments, a townhouse and our farm in Pound Ridge, but the place that I called home was the Stork Club," she wrote in a revised edition of "The Stork Club Cookbook and Bar Book," written with Ken Bloom and published in 2022. "It was where I went after school, to have a Coca-Cola, do my homework and sit with my dad. It was where we celebrated Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter, at our family table. No matter what the occasion, that's where we were."
She befriended the daughters of Bert Lahr, Gary Cooper and Jack Benny. She met Cary Grant with her friends when he was visiting a friend backstage on Broadway. ("We were a bunch of 14-year-olds," she later gushed, "and we thought we were going to die!")
Shermane attended the all-girls Spence School on the Upper East Side (she cringed at being chauffeured there and was finally allowed to take a public bus), learned ballroom dancing and was enrolled by her father in nearby Finch College so that he could keep her from straying like her wayward sisters. She later transferred to Connecticut College in New London but didn't graduate.
Ms. Billingsley was in her early 20s when the Stork Club closed. Her father was tapped out. She quit college to save money, her cousin Robert Billingsley said in an interview.
In 1965, she married Craig Drill, a Princeton graduate, former Navy officer and investment adviser, and they eventually moved to Ridgewood, N.J. After that marriage ended in divorce, she married Timothy J. Wheeler, who worked at the magazine National Review. He died in 2007.
In addition to her son Austin, from her first marriage, she is survived by another son from that marriage, Clifford Billingsley Drill; two grandsons; and a stepbrother, Robert Rodenberg.
Did she ever give up on trying to revive the club?
"The club was like a living memory to her," Austin Drill said by email, "and she hoped others might remember it too."
"Even in her final months of life," he added, "she was speaking with filmmakers, restaurateurs, publishers, historians, etc., about the legacy of the Stork Club, and how best to keep its spirit alive. So, no, she never gave up."

Stranded Afghans Risk Crossing a Jungle: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Taiba was being hunted by the men she had put behind bars.
The death threats came as the Americans withdrew from Afghanistan and the Taliban marched across her country, she said. In the chaos, cell doors were flung open, freeing the rapists and abusers she had helped send to prison.
"We will find you," the callers growled. "We will kill you."
Taiba's entire life had been shaped by the American vision of a democratic Afghanistan: She had studied law, worked with the Americans to fight violence against women and ultimately became a top government official for women's rights, gathering testimony that put abusers away.
But after saving so many women's lives, she was suddenly trying to save her own.
She and her husband, Ali, pleaded for help from a half-dozen nations -- many of which they'd worked with -- and found an American refugee program they might be eligible for. Taiba said she sent off her information, but never heard back.
"They left us behind," she said of the Americans. "Sometimes I think maybe God left all Afghans behind."
For months, Taiba kept trying to make it to America any way she could -- even by foot. She and her husband fled with their 2-year-old son, first to Pakistan, then to South America, joining the vast human tide of desperation pressing north toward the United States.
Like thousands of Afghans who have taken this same, unfathomable route to escape the Taliban and their country's economic collapse in the last 17 months, they trudged through the jungle, slept on the forest floor amid fire ants and snakes, hid their money in their food to fool thieves and crossed the sliver of land connecting North and South America -- the treacherous Darién Gap.
Now, after more than 16,000 miles, Taiba and her family had finally reached it: the American border.
In the darkness, Taiba crawled into a drainage tunnel under a highway. When she emerged, she saw two enormous steel fences, the last barriers between her old life and what she hoped would be a new one. A smuggler flung a ladder over the first wall.
Taiba gripped the rungs and began to climb into the country that had helped define her. She knew the Americans were turning away asylum seekers. A single thought consumed her.
Once she got in, would they let her stay?
'The failure is happening right now.'
Frantic parents breached airport gates with suitcases and children in hand. Panicked crowds climbed jet wings and clung to the sides of departing American planes. A few tried to hang on, lost their grip and fell from the skies.
It was August 2021, and the Taliban had swept into Kabul just as American troops pulled out, ending a 20-year occupation that left Afghanistan in the hands of the very militants Washington had ousted.
The images seemed a tragic coda to America's longest war. But for countless Afghans, the frenetic days of the U.S. withdrawal were only the beginning of a long, harrowing search for safety.
The new Taliban administration turned back decades of civil liberties, particularly for women. Afghans who had supported the West were terrified of being persecuted, and a careening economy pushed millions near starvation. Many Afghans fled to Pakistan, Iran and Turkey, often finding only short-term visas or worse -- beatings, detention and deportation.
Thousands tried for Europe, climbing into cargo trucks or taking flimsy boats across the Mediterranean Sea. At least 1,250 Afghan migrants have died trying to find refuge since the American withdrawal, the United Nations says.
Many others set their sights even farther: the United States.
More than 3,600 Afghans have traveled the same agonizing route as Taiba since the beginning of 2022, according to tallies in Panama, one of the most perilous sections of the journey. Many of them had partnered with the West for years -- lawyers, human rights advocates, members of the Afghan government or security forces. They packed up their children, parents or entire families, sold their apartments and borrowed enormous sums to pay for the passage, convinced there was nothing left for them back home.
Their journeys represent the collision of two of President Biden's biggest policy crises: the hasty American withdrawal from Afghanistan and the record number of migrants crossing the U.S. border.
Now, the fallout from a faraway war that many Americans thought was over is landing at the president's doorstep: Afghan men, women and children climbing over border walls under the cover of night, desperate to join a nation that, they feel, left them behind.
The withdrawal from Afghanistan is not just a failure "in the rearview mirror," said Francis Hoang, a former U.S. Army captain who runs an organization to help Afghans immigrate, called Allied Airlift 21.
"The failure is happening right now," he said.
The Afghans wend through about a dozen countries, for months or longer. Nearly all are robbed or extorted; some are kidnapped or jailed. Others are fought over by rival smugglers or sent back to countries they already passed through. Parents and children are torn apart by the authorities. Babies have been born along the way.
The Times traveled with a group of 54 Afghans through one of the hardest parts of the journey, the notorious Darién Gap, and interviewed nearly 100 people making the trek. Many spoke English, had entwined their lives with the Western mission in Afghanistan and hoped that, as American allies, they would be received with open arms.
Most set out for the U.S. border after flying to Brazil, which offers humanitarian visas for Afghans. From there, the smuggler fees mounted quickly, often costing $ 10,000 a person or more, sealing in the Afghans a conviction that they had to reach the United States, where they could earn enough money to dig out from debt and help their relatives back home.
Niazi, 41, traveled with his wife and three sons, all wearing New York baseball caps. He described working in the Afghan president's protective service, and showed off pictures of himself guarding Laura Bush, the American first lady, and President Barack Obama.
He then played a surveillance video of people he identified as members of the Taliban, beating his brothers as they searched for him. He had applied for a special U.S. visa, he said, but because he had worked for the Afghan government, not directly for the Americans, he wasn't eligible.
Ali and Nazanin, a pair of doctors in their 20s who had recently married, were risking the journey, too. Like Taiba and her family, they are Hazara, an ethnic minority massacred by the Taliban during their first regime in the 1990s, and believed they could never be safe under the new government.
"I am thinking about my future child," said Ali.
Two grandfathers, one who said he had worked for the toppled Afghan government, traveled with their families, 17 people in all. Mohammad Sharif, who said he was a former Afghan police officer, and his wife, Rahima, came too, carrying their infant son, born two months before in Brazil.
Nearly all of them asked to be identified only by their first names, to protect relatives back in Afghanistan.
Mozhgan, 20, was the most talkative. She had been in the 11th grade when the Taliban entered Kabul and she could no longer go to school.
The American presence had opened the world for her. She spoke multiple languages, including English, Hindi and bits of Chinese. She watched Marvel movies and listened to BTS, the Korean pop group whose music had turned her from what she called a "shy, sad, corner girl" into a confident, inquisitive woman.
She dreamed of being a fashion designer or a reporter, like the women in American movies. Her sister, Samira, 16, thought about being an astronaut. Under the Taliban, which have barred women from most public spaces, those lives were now impossible.
"Like being on a road with no destination," Mozhgan called it.
Their family, also Hazara, considered legal paths to the United States, Mozhgan said, but determined they would "take years."
Then a bomb went off at their brother's school in Kabul, most likely an attack by Islamic State militants challenging the Taliban, and her father decided to flee.
"You don't know if you will survive," she said, "so we have to take action now."
Thousands of despairing migrants have made the daunting jungle crossing from South America to the United States for years.
But before the Americans left Afghanistan and the Taliban took over, Afghans were hardly ever among them. Officials in Panama say that only about 100 Afghans in total crossed the jungle from 2010 to 2019.
Now, hundreds of Afghans are risking it every month, officials say, part of a historic crush of people pouring through the Darién, the only way from South America to the United States by land.
The Darién is a roadless, mountainous tangle, considered a last resort for decades, with notorious hardships: rivers that sweep away bodies, hills that cause heart attacks, mud that nearly swallows children, bandits who rob, kidnap, assault and kill.
But with the economic and political havoc of recent years, including the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, interest in the Darién has exploded -- along with relentless advertising on TikTok, Facebook and WhatsApp by smugglers and migrants alike, sometimes presenting the route like a family outing that almost anyone can manage.
"Safe. 100 percent trustworthy. Special packages with transport, lodging and food," reads one Facebook post showing people holding hands as they stroll toward a fluttering American flag. "Guaranteed."
Fewer than 11,000 people crossed the jungle each year, on average, from 2010 to 2020. But this year, officials say, as many as 400,000 are expected to make the journey, nearly all of them headed to the United States.
And while most are from Venezuela, Haiti and Ecuador, the route has increasingly become a United Nations of migration, with a growing number from China, India, Nigeria, Somalia and elsewhere.
Mr. Biden is trying hard to shut it down. In April, he and his allies in the region announced a 60-day campaign intended to end the illicit movement of people through the Darién. His administration has also imposed new rules that are expected to make it harder for all asylum seekers, including Afghans, to enter the United States.
Many of the Afghans on the journey knew Mr. Biden was clamping down on immigration, but said they were coming anyway -- no matter the hardship.
"If 10 times I am sent back," said Ali, the doctor, "10 times I will return."
'Are we going to survive?'
A village formed in Terminal B of São Paulo-Guarulhos airport: Afghans sleeping under wool blankets strung like tents across luggage carts.
It was December 2022, and most of them had arrived in Brazil days before, even weeks, carrying the last of their belongings and only a vague idea of what to do next.
They could stay in Brazil, even work. But few spoke Portuguese, and the nation's minimum wage was only about $ 250 a month. Most had large families -- five, 10 or 20 people -- to support back home. Many had borrowed their relatives' last savings to make it this far, and if they didn't pay it back, their families would go hungry.
"The only hope in the family is me," said Haroon, 27, an engineer who had recently arrived in Brazil.
So, many of the Afghans soon took off, their minds fixed on the United States.
They crossed Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, passed liked batons from smuggler to smuggler.
On a starless night in March, Taiba and her husband, Ali, waded toward a boat in Colombia with 50 other Afghans, headed for the Darién Gap. A haze blurred a full moon.
Their road map was nothing more than a terse, three-page PDF circulating around the world, sometimes on WhatsApp chains. Written in Persian, it offered advice on getting from Brazil all the way through Mexico, listing a few smuggler contacts and pithy travel tips.
In Colombia, "always remember to keep 10 dollars in your passport," to pay off police officers who threaten arrest. In the jungle, "the first day is stressful." In Mexico, "make sure to hide all your documents and money."
Taiba and Ali's son, a round-cheeked toddler who had just turned 3, was getting heavy, so they often strapped him to the back of a cousin, Jalil, 24, a kickboxing coach and an ideal bodyguard for the journey ahead.
Most of the Afghans had heard about the dangers of the Darién, and their smuggler offered them the so-called V.I.P. route -- $ 420 a person, versus the more common $ 300 -- that cut the trip to about four days, from as many as eight or nine.
As Taiba climbed into the boat, packing in with dozens of others like cargo, she tried to make sense of how much her life had changed in the last two years.
She and Ali had met as university students. He later worked as a translator for Spanish troops, he said, before taking a job with a United Nations contractor. Until the Taliban took over, they were happy -- and in love with the Afghanistan they were helping to build. Then, as fighters swept into Kabul, Taiba raced to her office to burn documents, hoping to protect herself and other women, she said, before fleeing to another city.
For months, they pleaded with governments for help, until Uruguay agreed to take them in. But in Montevideo, the capital, they quickly decided that they couldn't earn enough to support their families back home. Taiba argued for heading north.
Now, she was having regrets.
A boat captain barked at them to turn off their phones, so they could travel undetected by the police. The motor roared, and the 54 Afghans sped up the coast, crying, vomiting and praying. Many had never seen an ocean or sea.
"Are we going to drown?" Mozhgan wondered out loud. "Or are we going to survive?"
The next day, they entered the forest and trudged up three mountains, the last of which is known locally as La Llorona, the crying woman. They fell often, lanced their hands on spiked trees, dragged boots filled with mud and at times collapsed from exhaustion. The former policeman's son cried constantly.
Mohammad Rahim, 60, one of the two grandfathers in the family of 17, fared the worst, stopping many times each hour to lay in the dirt. His children knelt beside him, massaging his body back to life. Murmuring prayers, the other Afghans wondered if he would make it.
Near the top of La Llorona, Ahmad, 24, an engineer, began to break down.
"I am crazy to come here!" he yelled, banging his machete into the tree roots knotting the ground.
He had tried to enter the United States legally, applying for a humanitarian parole program in 2021, he said, but never heard back.
"No one cares about us!" he yelled. "We have important people left in Afghanistan and no one cares!"
In the final days of the American occupation in 2021, the Biden administration airlifted roughly 88,500 Afghans out of the country, an effort the American president called "extraordinary."
"Only the United States had the capacity and the will and the ability to do it," Mr. Biden told the American public afterward.
But many tens of thousands of other Afghans worked with the U.S. government or American organizations during the war, and could be at risk of retaliation, according to #AfghanEvac, a group of organizations helping Afghans seeking resettlement.
Fewer than 25,000 Afghans have received special visas or refugee status in the United States since the airlifts in 2021, government data shows. And the options are scarcer for people who didn't work with the United States but might still be in danger.
Roughly 52,000 Afghans have applied for a program called humanitarian parole. As of mid-April, just 760 people had been approved.
By comparison, more than 300,000 Ukrainians arrived in the United States under various programs in just over a year.
"I don't understand why the world has had their arms so open to Ukrainians and so closed to Afghans," said Shawn VanDiver, the U.S. Navy veteran who started #AfghanEvac.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. National Security Council, Adrienne Watson, said the administration was working to enhance an already robust resettlement program for Afghans. She called it "part of our long-term commitment to our Afghan allies."
Many of the Afghans in the jungle said they didn't feel that commitment.
"We did a lot of things for the American people," said Niazi, the father who showed pictures of himself as a guard with President Obama. "But the American people just left us."
A steep dirt hill signaled the Afghans' last push through the wilderness. Finally, they had reached a camp constructed by an Indigenous group, the Emberá. Taiba stared slack-jawed at the generators, wooden platforms and women selling fried chicken and Coca-Cola.
In the morning, the Emberá led them to canoes and, for $ 25 a person, ferried them to a checkpoint in Panama, where officials counted them, took down their nationalities and sent them on their way north.
Mohammad Azim, 70, the other grandfather, rushed to the river to wash himself. Then, beneath a fence topped by barbed wire, he knelt to pray -- thankful that he made it, apprehensive about the thousands of miles to go.
'Everything is dark.'
The group of 54 splintered soon after.
Taiba and her family took a bus through Costa Rica, walked for hours until they found a car through Nicaragua, and were forced to pay bribes to the police in Honduras. In Guatemala, they hiked through more forest, then paid another smuggler to get them from a bus to a boat, across a river and into a truck, all the way to southern Mexico.
Back in Uruguay, Taiba had shed her head scarf to blend in and cut her hair when it began to fall out. By now, she had lost 20 pounds and watched her child lose 15 percent of his body weight.
If the Americans didn't take her, she thought, maybe she would just keep going -- to Canada, where her husband had relatives and, she imagined, the government might be more welcoming.
Ali, the doctor who vowed to keep trying to make it to the United States even if he was "sent back" 10 times, proved prescient. Near the American border, he and his wife were stopped by the Mexican police, robbed and put on a bus across Mexico, back to the border with Guatemala.
They set out again from there, only to be apprehended for a second time and jailed for about a week.
News about other Afghans who tried to cross into the United States trickled in.
Milad, 29, a lawyer, climbed over the wall with his wife and children, ages 2 and 4. They were held in U.S. detention in Calexico, Calif., he said, and told they would be taken to a hotel. Instead, U.S. border officials put them in a white van with blacked out windows that dropped them on the street in Mexicali, Mexico, he said. His cousin Tamim, 27, a journalist, said he had a similar experience.
Ahmad Faheem Majeed, 28, a former Afghan Air Force intelligence officer who crossed into Texas in September 2022, was detained and charged with failing to enter at a designated checkpoint, a misdemeanor. He pleaded guilty and was held in U.S. custody for eight months, court records show.
"I helped these Americans," he said from Eden Detention Center in Texas, sometimes near tears. "I am not understanding why they are not helping me."
U.S. homeland security officials declined to discuss their cases.
Mozhgan's family made it to Mexico City, but was scared to continue without immigration paperwork issued by the Mexican government, which they thought would shield them from arrest. They waited in line for days before heading north.
Taiba and her family boarded a bus from Mexico City to the U.S. border.
"The pleasure of travel," the motto on the bus said. It had been a year since they left Afghanistan.
A weariness set in, her hope nearly buried by exhaustion. Criminals and the police stopped the bus repeatedly to extort money. On the third night, they reached Tijuana, border lights twinkling in the distance. It was early April.
The next evening, a smuggler brought them to the drainage tunnel in the middle of the city. As they climbed the first border fence, they could see wildflowers and a highway on the other side.
Taiba lowered herself to the ground with anticipation, her feet landing on dirt.
They had made it -- or so they thought.
They spent a cold night in an immigration netherworld, of sorts, trapped between two border fences. In the morning, U.S. Border Patrol officers swept them up. After so many thousands of miles, they said, their welcome was a detention center.
They had hoped to claim asylum then and there. Instead, U.S. officials handed them documents clarifying that each was an "alien present in the United States," subject to deportation.
They could fight removal at a court hearing, set for June 30, 2025, on the other side of the country, in Boston.
To apply for asylum, they would have to navigate the process on their own, or find a lawyer. Until then, they couldn't work.
A charity briefly put them in a hotel room, but the questions began to gnaw: How would they eat? Where could they live? Was this the American dream?
"Everything is dark," said Taiba's husband, Ali.
The others faced similar challenges.
Milad, the lawyer, tried the crossing again and made it, landing a kitchen job under the table. Ali and Nazanin, the doctors, finally got to the border and across it, then made their way to her brother's home in Georgia. Niazi, the presidential guard, wound up in a shelter in San Diego, wondering how to get his three boys into classes -- they had lost two years of schooling.
None of the families had a lawyer or a clear idea of how to survive, much less feed their families back home in Afghanistan. Most began writing desperate messages to migrant aid organizations, but the groups were overwhelmed, and the Afghans rarely heard back.
Mozhgan's family faced a different terror: She had gone missing.
She had scaled the first border fence, then spent three nights between the walls. Finally, immigration officials carted her family to detention -- but she and an older brother, both over 18, were treated as single adults and kept in custody, while the rest of the family was released in California.
They had fled Afghanistan together and spent months trekking through unforgiving terrain, evading bandits and dodging corrupt police officers -- only to be separated, without any contact, in the country where they hoped to find refuge.
Her mother, Anisa, was frantic, said Mozhgan's father, Abdul. "We might not be able to see them again," he recalled her saying.
Their children were released about a week later and reunited with the family.
Taiba kept moving. In early May, an aid group in New York offered a spot in a shelter and the family headed east, bound for more uncertainty. Without asylum, they faced a life in the shadows, like millions of other undocumented immigrants in the United States.
Her husband had always assumed the Darién would be the hardest part of the journey.
"But when I emerged from the jungle, we have seen, 'No,"' he said. "The difficulties are forever."

Full text: Welcome to Flamingo Estate.
LOS ANGELES -- Flamingo Estate, a lifestyle company set in a 1940s Spanish-style house in the hills on the border between the Eagle Rock and Highland Park neighborhoods, sells candles that smell like tomatoes and rosemary. Oprah Winfrey named them one of her favorite things.
Pink is a theme for both the brand and the house. Its facade is pink stucco. Its Pink Moon rosé was made to match the color on the underside of a flamingo's wing. The company makes botanical products, not all of which are obvious hits. Last Christmas, its infamous nine-pound sack of manure (using a synonym for excrement) that cost $ 75, went viral. It's currently out of stock.
For $ 80 before shipping, one can purchase a 6.5-ounce jar of dried strawberries dusted with guajillo chile and a squeeze of lime. They are snacks, yes, but also they are statements: If you can afford them, money is not something that concerns you. Everything is shipped in boxes printed with the motto: "We are a home for radical pleasure."
Though Flamingo Estate was named after the home of its founder, Richard Christiansen, the name implies something far bigger than the seven-acre lot he shares with Aaron Harvey, his partner (and the creative director of the company), and their dogs, Daylesford and Freeway.
"A potential investor just came over and was like, 'Wait, everything is from here?"' Mr. Christiansen said. "She was expecting hundreds of acres in the middle of Los Angeles." He had to explain that though Flamingo Estates, the brand, was inspired by his house he now uses ingredients from 110 local farms.
Mr. Christiansen bought his home eight years ago. It was once a porn studio, and he transformed it into an Instagram playland.
"It's over the top," said Martha Stewart, who has known Mr. Christiansen for years and wrote the foreword to the Flamingo Estate cookbook ( $ 78). "He buys a house on the top of the hill overlooking Los Angeles, and he transforms this ex-porn king's mansion into a veritable paradise of gardens and deep, dark baths and furniture that's crazy and good. He looks like a young boy with pink cheeks, and he's generous and thoughtful and busy, yet you never think he's that busy."
The vibe skews colorful and vaguely tropical. In the living room, there is a limited-edition David Hockney "Caribbean Tea Time" screen and a large floral printed sofa from the Belgian designer JP Demeyer, mixed with chairs and side tables bought at Parisian flea markets. In the kitchen, a terrazzo floor in shades of mint, white, black and rose is dominated by an enormous antique stove. Just off the kitchen is a small bar with vintage Baccarat crystal decanters and bamboo stools.
Mr. Christiansen's home is where nearly everything the brand sells is staged and photographed, and it drives sales. It has also served as a background for Quentin Tarantino and Margot Robbie to be photographed for magazine spreads, for Billie Eilish to be interviewed by the BBC, and for Emily Weiss, the Glossier founder, to host her baby shower.
It would be easy to mistake Flamingo Estate for a hotel or club. "I thought it was a public space that people could maybe purchase a ticket to, like a garden," Chrissy Teigen said in a voice memo. She asked Mr. Christiansen over Instagram if she could bring her family. "We pulled up and I knocked on the gate and Richard popped out, and I was like, 'Oh my God, wait, this is not a public entity of any kind."'
Mr. Christiansen gave them a tour, and her kids played with the chickens. "I fully believe Richard is an angel or an alien from another planet," Ms. Teigen said. "At the risk of sounding very L.A., he has this energy about him and this aura about him that's really special."
They ended up making three jams together -- as in the kind of jams one spreads on scones, not the musical variety.
A Man With Many Ideas
Architects from the French firm Studio KO did the renovation of Mr. Christiansen's home, basing some of the landscaping on hot weather gardens in Morocco. Surveying the grounds after an exceptionally cold and wet California winter, Mr. Christiansen sounded poetic: "The sage has exploded, the wisteria has purple blooms. The orchard is so joyful, it's like it's singing."
There are climbing jasmine vines and a cast-concrete bathhouse with a fireplace and tiles that match the Balearic Sea. Mr. Christiansen is interested in someday creating a Flamingo Estate "temple to bathing" -- inspired by the one at Flamingo Estate.
But he is a man with many ideas. Last year the company introduced $ 250 jars of honey culled from beehives placed in the gardens of celebrities, including Ai Weiwei and Julianne Moore.
"How wild is it that LeBron's honey on the Westside tastes completely different from Tiffany Haddish's in South Central," Mr. Christiansen said. He is still negotiating who will participate next.
Ms. Moore said the process was easy. "There is a beekeeper in Montauk he contacted, and she tended the bees and collected the honey," she said. "We continue to have the bees."
Mr. Christiansen stood with his dogs inside the goat keeper's shed, a space the size of a small office, full of jars with labels that read "fermented indigo" and decorated with custom hand-painted wallpaper from the British company de Gournay depicting local flora and fauna: cactuses, owls and cliff roses.
The dogs have a slightly adversarial relationship with the goats, who live in a pen with the chickens. On a stormy Sunday in February, realizing the goats were cold, Mr. Christiansen posted a call for cashmere sweaters on Instagram. "I was like, 'Oh, it's freezing, the poor goats,"' Mr. Christiansen said. Now the goats wear cashmere.
Mr. Christiansen stood overlooking proteas and mimosa plants that reminded him of his native Australia. His parents were beekeepers who raised him on their sugar cane farm in northern New South Wales. They didn't entertain. He was a kid obsessed with Chanel and Calvin Klein ads in magazines, who studied law and then went into marketing.
Flamingo Estate began as a pandemic project. After almost two decades at Chandelier Creative, the agency he founded in 2005, Mr. Christiansen, 46, was depleted emotionally and physically. The company worked with a lot of fashion brands and had offices in Los Angeles, New York and Paris.
Mr. Christiansen was living in Los Angeles. Chandelier was at a standstill in the early days of the pandemic. (He is no longer involved in the agency.) That was when he met a woman who was in danger of losing her farm because she sold food to restaurants that were closed.
He started selling her fresh produce to friends in $ 35 boxes. Word spread among other farmers who were eager to join. Farmers sold directly to Flamingo Estate, which paid them weekly in cash. "It was $ 300 that week, $ 600 the next week," Mr. Christiansen said. "And you know, it just kept growing. One farm became two, became five, became 10 and now 110. We didn't have any intention that it would become really a business."
"At some point we shifted to a model that was more structured, asking farmers, 'Why don't you plant stuff specifically for us?"'
Locals like Kris Jenner can still pick up farm boxes, but that's just one part of Flamingo Estate's business. Sales have doubled each year, Mr. Christiansen said, noting that revenue was $ 10 million last year. "We are about to hit profit this next quarter," he said.
Seventy-five percent of the customers, according to information provided by Mr. Christiansen, are women between 24 and 40 years old. They are split evenly between the East and West Coast. "The opportunity for us is in cities like Chicago, Dallas, Miami," he said.
"I really do think we've got these two customer segments," he continued. "We've got people who care a lot about the environment and about sourcing and about farming. Then I think we've got this customer here who's a luxury shopper, who thinks the house is curated and likes the brand and especially the collaborations we do, and sometimes they cross over. But very rarely, actually."
Making the Leap
The marketing side of Mr. Christiansen still burns very bright. Each Sunday he pulls the information on the top 50 customers that week and texts or calls them. "This one customer was literally our best customer over and over and over again," he said. "And I was, like, I wonder who this is? And then I had a lovely conversation with him. And then, you know, one thing led to another. Now that customer is an investor via a family office."
Mr. Christiansen, at first, courted individual investors for funding rather than venture capital firms. "I hate dealing with money," he said. "I don't even check my A.T.M. balance."
For all that, the Flamingo Estate brand just closed a round of outside funding. It raised $ 7.5 million, earmarked for working capital.
"We have left the kids' table and gone to the adults' table," Mr. Christiansen said.
"We spoke to some people who were green investors, and a number of them were, like, we'll only invest in organic-certified or regenerative-certified, whatever -- just very didactic about it. I said that for some small growers, getting certified organic is really difficult. It's expensive."
Mr. Christiansen is also open to working with large agricultural companies. "For me, progress would be that situation where people say we're far from perfect," he said. "The opportunity for me is to work with someone who's got room to improve. In our industry there's so much greenwashing. It makes me irate that people give themselves a pat on the back for one or two ingredients that are goodish for the world."
This summer, Flamingo Estate is opening a pop-up in an old auto body shop in East Hampton, N.Y., the idea being to bring your body in for a summer tuneup. The gas station snack section will be called the Inconvenience Store. There are books coming out later this year, including a workbook on how to live a pleasurable life and another called "House of Radical Pleasure," which will be a tour of the property divided by the senses.
Flamingo Estate, the home, is key to the allure of Flaming Estate, the brand, even if having one's home as a kind of living set and rotating dinner party can be annoying. Mr. Harvey, he said with a laugh, is frustrated with it: "He's tired of making the bed."
"Even though we've grown quickly, it's still super-personal," he said. "We make stuff that I want to use in the kitchen. I use the soap in the shower. I do all of the social myself. It's still my kitchen, my bathroom, my dogs and my trees."

“We spoke to some people who were green investors, and a number of them were, like, we’ll only invest in organic-certified or regenerative-certified, whatever — just very didactic about it. I said that for some small growers, getting certified organic is really difficult. It’s expensive.”
Christiansen is also open to working with large agricultural companies. “For me, progress would be that situation where people say we’re far from perfect,” he said. “The opportunity for me is to work with someone who’s got room to improve. In our industry there’s so much greenwashing. It makes me irate that people give themselves a pat on the back for one or two ingredients that are goodish for the world.”
This summer, Flamingo Estate is opening a pop-up in an old auto body shop in East Hampton, New York, the idea being to bring your body in for a summer tuneup. The gas station snack section will be called the Inconvenience Store. There are books coming out later this year, including a workbook on how to live a pleasurable life and another called “House of Radical Pleasure,” which will be a tour of the property divided by the senses.
Flamingo Estate, the home, is key to the allure of Flaming Estate, the brand, even if having one’s home as a kind of living set and rotating dinner party can be annoying. Harvey, he said with a laugh, is frustrated with it: “He’s tired of making the bed.”
“Even though we’ve grown quickly, it’s still super-personal,” he said. “We make stuff that I want to use in the kitchen. I use the soap in the shower. I do all of the social myself. It’s still my kitchen, my bathroom, my dogs and my trees.”

Drummer Makes Pressure His Ally: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The drummer whose genre-crossing work has brought acclaim here and abroad returns with "Animals," an LP of jazz, rap and soul inspired by the struggle to be OK.
On a cloudy afternoon, the drummer Kassa Overall strolled past his first New York City apartment, a second-floor room in a Fort Greene brownstone. He had moved to Brooklyn after graduating from Oberlin in 2006 to play in the local jazz scene while improving his chops as a beatmaker. To help him make ends meet, the drummer Billy Hart got him a gig playing the djembe for a physical therapy dance class at a nursing home in Harlem.
"So I came into the game with a consistent paying thing, low rent, and it was just like, 'Damn, I'm here,"' Overall, 40, said as he toured his old neighborhood in March. "So I just stayed."
Fast-forward to 2020: Overall had built himself into a noted musician here and abroad, with a multifaceted sound synthesizing jazz, rap and R&B, and an album called "I Think I'm Good" -- on the British tastemaker Gilles Peterson's Brownswood Recordings label -- poised to push him into wider circles. Or so he thought. "It really felt like this was about to pop," Overall recalled. "We did Japan, then we did the West Coast, and we were selling out merch every show."
But the pandemic shut down the possibility of further touring. Overall flew back to his native Seattle and wondered what was next. "I went from being a touring musician and always having extra income to barely having enough," he said over lunch, opening up about his hard times without any apprehension. "I felt like I wasn't as successful as it felt like I was on the internet."
The anguish led him to start work on a new album, "Animals," out May 26, about the struggles of surviving as an entertainer, and how the pressure to stand out can push an artist too far. "I'm one of those people that's like, I had mental illness stuff back in the day, and I have a sensitivity," he explained. "I can't just walk through the world normal. I got to do a lot of [expletive] to keep my train on the track."
Overall had challenges throughout college, while he was studying jazz performance; he couldn't sleep and had bouts of what he called "super high energy." Then he'd be depressed for days. "I remember even telling my mom one day, 'I think I'm bipolar,"' he said, recalling a moment when he was in high school. "I had this period where I was getting real isolated." He described a manic episode where he began seeing and hearing things that weren't there. "I started seeing stuff on me."
"I Think I'm Good" unpacked the experience of living with bipolar disorder through scant electroacoustic backing tracks and heavily modulated vocals. "Animals" takes a different approach, inspired by Overall's feeling of kinship with unconventional musicians like Ol' Dirty Bastard, Kurt Cobain and Jimi Hendrix -- "artists that you could tell were special, but also couldn't really handle the pressure," he said.
The album's vigorous jazz, rap and soul blends live instruments with electronic drum tracks. Its formidable roster of collaborators includes the rappers Danny Brown, Lil B and Ish of Shabazz Palaces; the vocalists Nick Hakim and Laura Mvula; and the jazz instrumentalists Theo Croker and Vijay Iyer. "The Lava Is Calm" features chilling piano; "Maybe We Can Stay" spotlights sweeping strings and flutes darting across a bouncy backbeat.
"It feels like you're in a zoo -- you can't go full animal, you know?" Overall said. "I was feeling like, within this machine and within this whole organism, I can see within myself, I'm doing everything I can to handle it, and I can barely handle it. So think about somebody who's not doing anything to handle it. How are they going to get through all this?"
Overall's childhood in Seattle was filled with music and life lessons from his free-spirited parents. (His mother worked for the local PBS station, and his father did odd jobs and stayed at home with the children.) "Everybody else had Kraft singles and Coca-Cola," he quipped, "we had soy milk and tofu."
He was a quick study who learned how to play drums as a young child, exploring a living room full of instruments that his father collected. There was a piano, saxophones, trumpets, clarinets, a broken violin, a four-track recorder and a beat machine that he said no one knew how to use. But Overall learned how to manipulate the electronic equipment; by fourth grade, he and his older brother, Carlos, started playing jazz songs like "Autumn Leaves" and "A Night in Tunisia."
"I'm coming home with a lot of dollar bills and ironing them," he remembered of their early performances. "And my dad was super hands-on with us. He would take us to the spot and set up, we'd find a corner and make bread."
Overall grew up listening to a wide array of artists -- John Coltrane and Ravi Shankar, Public Enemy and DJ Quik -- which gave him a natural feel for all kinds of sounds. A turning point in his relationship to music came when he was a sophomore in high school and landed a $ 9 an hour job sweeping peanut shells and taking out trash at the Major League Baseball stadium in Seattle. After he and some friends were fired for smoking marijuana, he had a realization.
"Wait a minute. I'm doing jazz gigs, getting a hundred a night, 150, sometimes 200 on a good gig," Overall remembered thinking. "So I could either level this up or I could get better at sweeping peanuts and stuff. And I haven't had a real job since then."
Hart, a mentor and one of Overall's Oberlin professors, was taken by his student's assertiveness. "I knew he had a certain amount of self-confidence that was obvious when he got there," said Hart, who is also a noted Herbie Hancock and McCoy Tyner collaborator. "As far as I'm concerned, Kassa is a jazz musician who has excelled in the pop field," he added. "He's found a unique direction all his own. If he keeps going the way he's going, he's going to be a major star."
Peterson, the Brownswood Recordings founder, was one of Overall's early supporters, and he said he was struck by Overall's curiosity for sounds outside jazz. "He's kind of incorporated all these elements and made something fresh and new, but with all the aspects of traditional music," he said. "He has a really great sense of being able to push the audience to a point where they can't take anymore before bringing the beat back in -- it's brave."
Speaking and writing candidly about his own struggles requires its own bravery, but Overall says the new album isn't simply about one person's trials.
"We're all aspiring to reach a higher place. And we're all aspiring to do better," he said. "But also have empathy for those who don't. Because I know how hard it is. I know how hard it is to just do OK. There's a large percentage of us that are not going to do OK. So maybe those are the people we consider animals. But it could have been you, could have been me. May have been me in the past life, or in the next life."

Strong Earnings Stretch Market's Rally: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/strong-earnings-stretch-markets-rally/docview/2815126055/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks rose again on Thursday after more companies reported better profits than expected, while yields climbed after a Federal Reserve official cautioned the end to its interest-rate increases may not arrive as soon as Wall Street hoped.
The S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent, adding to its rally from the day before as hopes rise further that the U.S. government can avoid a disastrous default on its debt.
The video-game maker Take-Two Interactive shot to the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after it forecast a huge jump in revenue for the fiscal year following this one. That stoked speculation that Grand Theft Auto VI is on the way, and its stock jumped 11.7 percent.
Bath & Body Works was close behind with a gain of 10.7 percent. It reported stronger revenue and earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected.
Also helping to support Wall Street was another retailer, Walmart, which rose 1.3 percent after reporting stronger results for the latest quarter than expected. It raised its financial forecast for the full year, though it said it's seeing shoppers remain cautious about spending.
Much scrutiny has been on the retail industry because strong spending by U.S. households has been one of the main pillars keeping the slowing economy out of a recession.
Stocks have remained remarkably resilient since early April despite a long list of worries. A major reason for that is hope the Fed would take it easier on its rate increases, which have slowed inflation at the expense of risking a recession and knocking down prices across financial markets.
The widespread bet was that the Fed would take a pause at its next meeting in June. But Lorie Logan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, cooled some of those hopes in a prepared speech for the Texas Bankers Association.
"The data in coming weeks could yet show that it is appropriate to skip a meeting," she said. "As of today, though, we aren't there yet."
Treasury yields climbed as traders increased bets that the Fed would raise rates again at its June meeting, though the majority are still forecasting a pause.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.64 percent from 3.57 percent late Wednesday. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, rose to 4.25 percent from 4.16 percent.
Higher rates have already slowed swaths of the economy and helped lead to three of the largest U.S. bank failures in history since March. Reports on the economy on Thursday came in mixed.
One showed that fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected. While that is good news for workers and for a so-far solid job market, it could also result in upward pressure on inflation. That is what the Fed has been trying desperately to lower by cranking its benchmark interest rate to the highest level since 2007.
A separate report said that manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region is continuing to weaken, though not quite as badly as economists expected.
Cisco Systems stock swung between small gains and losses through the day after the company reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected and raised its forecast for the current quarter. Analysts said some investors may be disappointed because of worries about lower-than-expected growth in the following fiscal year. Its stock ended with a gain of 1.2 percent.
The majority of companies in the S&P 500 have reported stronger profits for the first three months of the year than analysts expected. But they are still on track to report a second straight quarter of weaker earnings than a year earlier, according to FactSet.
In stock markets abroad, indexes rose in much of Europe and Asia after Wall Street's rally from Wednesday spread westward. That lift came after President Biden said he was confident about reaching a deal with Republicans to allow the U.S. government to increase its credit limit and borrow more.
An agreement could avert a potential first-ever default on Washington's debt. The government is scheduled to run out of cash to pay its bills as soon as June 1 unless a deal is made, and economists say a U.S. federal default could have catastrophic consequences across financial markets and the economy.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.6 percent to continue a strong recent run, while Germany's DAX in Europe returned 1.3 percent.

Taking On the Infinite Again With a Sly Wink: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Once a high-profile fixture of the 1960s New York avant-garde, Yayoi Kusama has long since become an icon, in the sense of a visually recognizable brand. Her polka dots, her spectacular sculptures of flowers and pumpkins, and most of all her "Infinity Mirror Rooms," which regularly draw crowds willing to wait hours for as little as one minute inside -- it's all as familiar, and as reliably perfect, as Coca-Cola. Like Coca-Cola, it also goes with anything: A recent collaboration with Louis Vuitton even included Instagram and Snapchat filters.
The downside of being a brand might be a certain predictability. But being so well known actually provides a visual thinker as adept and inventive as Kusama with a kind of head start on shocking and delighting her audience, because she can achieve so much just by tweaking our expectations. Her latest‌ room, ‌a 13-foot-high white cube with a fully mirrored interior‌ titled "Dreaming of Earth's Sphericity, I Would Offer My Love," is as close as pop art comes to a revelation.
Unlike most previous ‌rooms, this one, which is currently showing at David Zwirner Gallery in Manhattan as part of the new exhibition "I Spend Each Day Embracing Flowers," has windows large enough to see through from the inside -- ‌16 full, half or quarter circles colored red, yellow, green or blue. Each partial circle is hard against an edge, so that, with its reflection, it appears whole. Among other things, this means that your gaze doesn't pause at the edge, instead gliding painlessly right into the mirror world.
Where previous infinity rooms flirted with claustrophobia, now, because you can keep half an eye on the everyday world, you'll contemplate the infinite with bemusement. You might catch a reflection of your own legs superimposed on someone outside, as in a Dan Graham pavilion, or find yourself peering out curiously at the yellow-tinted gallery.
From other angles the circles are opaque, evoking a Modernist disco party as they bubble into the distance. As usual, the best action happens in the corners, where you can watch miniature reflections of yourself walk right past one another -- your ego snubbing your id, or vice versa -- or convene four of your doppelgängers in an intimate tête-à-tête. I was so interested in all my own miniature critics that I didn't notice the crisp, full-size reflection right in front of me until just before I stepped out.
Along with the mirrored room, "I Spend Each Day Embracing Flowers" includes three enormous steel flowers; three yellow and black "pumpkin" walls polished to a sports-car shine; and nearly three dozen new acrylic paintings. Graphic, boldly colored compositions of dots and lines, the paintings reach across the room and grab you by the collar, particularly one untitled canvas from 2021, which is just slightly too busy to take in at a glance. The flowers are charming, if nothing more, but the pumpkins, with their hat-like stems and sexy undulations, are surprisingly complex and sophisticated.
Still, the "Infinity Mirror Room" is the star, because, as promised by the name, it offers something for everyone and can never be depleted. It's a high-concept Japanese teahouse whose low yellow door forces you to stoop as you go in. It's a metaphor for consciousness, the art work, or any other ostensibly sealed box of illusory vistas. It's an Instagram-ready spectacle, famous for being famous. It's the very definition of "what you see is what you get," but you could never find every interesting detail, even if you stayed all day.
The only issue is the line, which is first come first served. As a critic, I got to skip to the front, so I asked a few visitors what they thought. Caterina Alves, visiting from London, had waited about an hour and felt it was totally worth it. "First of all, she's amazing," she said, adding, "This is the only free exhibition I've found of Kusama." (The gallery will arrange visits for school groups, too.) Gina Noy, close to the door, felt that the hour-plus wait added to the experience. "It's great," she said, gesturing at the women standing behind her, "because we just chatted." And Stephanie Helen, whom I caught up with after she came out, proposed this general advice: "If it's something good, wait on line for it."

In Japan, Religious Right Has Sway on Gay Rights: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: As a G7 summit nears in Hiroshima, Japan is under pressure to show greater support for equality. A national Shinto group has spread a more hostile message.
To millions of Japanese, the Shinto faith is not so much a spiritual practice as a cultural one. Every January, crowds gather at shrines to pray for good fortune for the new year. Families take their children to celebrate rites of passage, and many seek blessings for luck in romance, school entrance exams or job interviews.
Few regard these rituals as being tethered to any fixed doctrine -- Shintoism, an indigenous religion, has no official dogma or scripture. But unbeknown to most in largely secular Japan, a national Shinto association has tried to spread a conservative ideological message among lawmakers, including on gay and transgender rights.
Japan is the only nation in the Group of 7 that has not legalized same-sex unions, and foreign ambassadors have pushed the country to support equality more forcefully in the run-up to a summit in Hiroshima starting later this week. Polls show overwhelming support for same-sex marriage in Japan; one of the country's most influential business leaders recently called it "embarrassing" that Japan has not sanctioned the unions.
Lawmakers, under pressure from the Shinto group and other traditionalist forces, have lagged behind public opinion, struggling to agree on even limited expressions of support for the rights of gay and transgender people.
Last summer, the Shinto organization distributed a 94-page pamphlet at a large meeting for affiliated members of Parliament, mostly from the governing Liberal Democratic Party, that included a transcript of a lecture describing homosexuality as "an acquired mental disorder, an addiction" that could be fixed with "restorative therapy."
Another transcribed lecture opposed passage of an L.G.B.T.Q. rights bill, claiming that "there is no systemic discrimination" in Japan and warning that "left-wing activists will use this as their weapon" and that there would be "an outburst of lawsuits."
This week, a Liberal Democratic parliamentary committee approved a modestly worded bill stating that there "should be no unfair discrimination" against L.G.B.T.Q. people. Activists and opposition party leaders say the bill, which may come before the full Parliament as the G7 convenes, is weaker than one that failed two years ago.
Scholars say that behind-the-scenes efforts by the Shinto group -- the Shinto Association of Spiritual Leadership, the political arm of an organization that oversees 80,000 shrines -- are one reason for the disconnect between the broader society and the political sphere.
Many shrine workers and visitors may not necessarily know of, or agree with, the Shinto association's efforts to influence government policy.
But conservatives in the governing party "really rely on the religious right for their election campaigns," said Kazuyoshi Kawasaka, a lecturer in modern Japanese studies at Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf, Germany. The influence of such groups "is much more important than the public supporting same-sex marriage," Mr. Kawasaka said.
Naofumi Ogawa, a lawyer for the Shinto group, said in an email that the pamphlet does "not directly represent the views of the organization."
But the group has posted documents on its own website describing calls "for an excessive protection of rights" or for legalizing same-sex marriage as "movements to dismantle the family structure."
During an interview with foreign media last month, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida explained why Japan had not yet legalized same-sex marriage. "The situation surrounding each country is different," he said in a prepared answer to a question from The New York Times. "Careful, thorough discussion is needed."
The influence of the religious right on conservative politicians in Japan remained largely hidden until the assassination last year of Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister who was gunned down by a man who held a grudge against the Unification Church, the fringe religious movement.
After Mr. Abe's death, the Japanese media uncovered connections between the church and more than 100 members of Parliament, including the former prime minister, the vast majority of them in the governing party.
Affiliates of the Unification Church have also campaigned against gay and transgender rights in Japan. An editorial in the World Daily, a newspaper with ties to the church, recently declared that the current L.G.B.T.Q. bill "may trigger crime" and that "trans women might invade women's spaces."
A political sister organization of the Unification Church said that it had not lobbied lawmakers on the "L.G.B.T. bill in particular" but that it believed the bill "has not been fully discussed and is premature."
While the Unification Church was heavily scrutinized after Mr. Abe's death, the Shinto association has operated mostly under the media radar, seeking to influence lawmakers on other longstanding social issues.
It has pushed conservatives to preserve a law that requires married couples to choose one surname and to prohibit female heirs from ascending to the imperial throne.
As an increasing number of municipalities in Japan have offered same-sex partnerships and gay couples have brought lawsuits calling the country's failure to recognize same-sex marriages unconstitutional, the Shinto association has begun to "feel very threatened by this issue," said Tomomi Yamaguchi, a professor at Montana State University who studies gender and sexuality in Japan.
The sponsor of the L.G.B.T.Q. bill, Takeshi Iwaya, said he was wary of the way the shrine group had inserted itself into the current debate. "I think they are stepping too deep into policy," said Mr. Iwaya, a Liberal Democrat.
Approving the current bill required more moderate Liberal Democrats to expend significant political capital, with some facing severe criticism.
"Every day I get calls asking me to oppose the bill, and the phone won't stop ringing," said Tomomi Inada, a former defense minister and Liberal Democratic lawmaker who sponsored the bill two years ago. "There is a lot of pressure. People have tried to tarnish my re-election chances."
Foreign ambassadors, led by the U.S. envoy, Rahm Emanuel, have spoken out in support of the current L.G.B.T.Q. bill, as well as same-sex marriage, while pointing to Japanese public support.
"There's right-wing efforts that are pretty entrenched, and in my own view they kind of punch above their weight class," Mr. Emanuel said. "You can't get to 70 percent" public polling support "without some element of self-identified conservative voters who are saying we're for same-sex marriage."
But political apathy makes it difficult for gay and transgender advocates to recruit allies.
Voters think "nothing will change, so they are not interested in politics," said Gon Matsunaka, director of Marriage for All Japan, an advocacy group.
Business leaders argue that Japan needs to align with its international peers to recruit workers from abroad and keep pace economically.
"Japan has been insisting that we should be homogeneous," said Takeshi Niinami, chief executive of Suntory, the beverage maker, and chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives. "But now corporates are much more globalizing."
Although more companies are offering equal benefits to same-sex couples, few employees take advantage of them. Patrick Jordan, vice president of human resources at Coca-Cola Japan, said he knew of only one Japanese employee in an office of close to 600 who was out as gay.
Intolerance of gay relationships or transgender identity in Japan is relatively modern.
During the Tokugawa period, which spanned the 17th to mid-19th centuries, samurai men regularly engaged in same-sex partnerships, said Gary Leupp, author of "Male Colors: The Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan."
Japan stopped criminalizing gay sex long before many Western countries. Both the Kabuki and Takarazuka theatrical traditions embrace fluid gender identities, and gay and transgender performers appear regularly on television. There is a flourishing gay and transgender nightlife in Tokyo.
Yet gay and transgender people say they continue to live hidden lives. Kohei Katsuyama, who lives in Tokyo, quit the police force because he feared repercussions if he told colleagues about his sexuality.
"I thought that if I came out and people found out, it would be game over," said Mr. Katsuyama, who has cut himself off from his family because he believes they will not accept that he is living with a male partner. "And I think many people still think this way as well."

TOKYO — To millions of Japanese, the Shinto faith is not so much a spiritual practice as a cultural one. Every January, crowds gather at shrines to pray for good fortune for the new year. Families take their children to celebrate rites of passage, and many seek blessings for luck in romance, school entrance exams or job interviews.
Few regard these rituals as being tethered to any fixed doctrine — Shintoism, an indigenous religion, has no official dogma or scripture. But unbeknown to most in largely secular Japan, a national Shinto association has tried to spread a conservative ideological message among lawmakers, including on gay and transgender rights.
Japan is the only nation in the Group of 7 that has not legalized same-sex unions, and foreign ambassadors have pushed the country to support equality more forcefully in the run-up to a summit in Hiroshima starting later this week. Polls show overwhelming support for same-sex marriage in Japan; one of the country’s most influential business leaders recently called it “embarrassing” that Japan has not sanctioned the unions.
Lawmakers, under pressure from the Shinto group and other traditionalist forces, have lagged behind public opinion, struggling to agree on even limited expressions of support for the rights of gay and transgender people.
Last summer, the Shinto organization distributed a 94-page pamphlet at a large meeting for affiliated members of Parliament, mostly from the governing Liberal Democratic Party, that included a transcript of a lecture describing homosexuality as “an acquired mental disorder, an addiction” that could be fixed with “restorative therapy.”
Another transcribed lecture opposed passage of an LGBTQ rights bill, claiming that “there is no systemic discrimination” in Japan and warning that “left-wing activists will use this as their weapon” and that there would be “an outburst of lawsuits.”
This week, a Liberal Democratic parliamentary committee approved a modestly worded bill stating that there “should be no unfair discrimination” against LGBTQ people. Activists and opposition party leaders say the bill, which may come before the full Parliament as the G-7 convenes, is weaker than one that failed two years ago.
Scholars say that behind-the-scenes efforts by the Shinto group — the Shinto Association of Spiritual Leadership, the political arm of an organization that oversees 80,000 shrines — are one reason for the disconnect between the broader society and the political sphere.
Many shrine workers and visitors may not necessarily know of, or agree with, the Shinto association’s efforts to influence government policy.
But conservatives in the governing party “really rely on the religious right for their election campaigns,” said Kazuyoshi Kawasaka, a lecturer in modern Japanese studies at Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf, Germany. The influence of such groups “is much more important than the public supporting same-sex marriage,” Kawasaka said.
Naofumi Ogawa, a lawyer for the Shinto group, said in an email that the pamphlet does “not directly represent the views of the organization.”
But the group has posted documents on its own website describing calls “for an excessive protection of rights” or for legalizing same-sex marriage as “movements to dismantle the family structure.”
During an interview with foreign media last month, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida explained why Japan had not yet legalized same-sex marriage.
“The situation surrounding each country is different,” he said in a prepared answer to a question from The New York Times. “Careful, thorough discussion is needed.”
The influence of the religious right on conservative politicians in Japan remained largely hidden until the assassination last year of Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister who was gunned down by a man who held a grudge against the Unification Church, the fringe religious movement.
After Abe’s death, the Japanese media uncovered connections between the church and more than 100 members of Parliament, including the former prime minister, the vast majority of them in the governing party.
Affiliates of the Unification Church have also campaigned against gay and transgender rights in Japan. An editorial in the World Daily, a newspaper with ties to the church, recently declared that the current LGBTQ bill “may trigger crime” and that “trans women might invade women’s spaces.”
A political sister organization of the Unification Church said that it had not lobbied lawmakers on the “LGBT bill in particular” but that it believed the bill “has not been fully discussed and is premature.”
While the Unification Church was heavily scrutinized after Abe’s death, the Shinto association has operated mostly under the media radar, seeking to influence lawmakers on other longstanding social issues.
It has pushed conservatives to preserve a law that requires married couples to choose one surname and to prohibit female heirs from ascending to the imperial throne.
As an increasing number of municipalities in Japan have offered same-sex partnerships and couples have brought lawsuits calling the country’s failure to recognize same-sex marriages unconstitutional, the Shinto association has begun to “feel very threatened by this issue,” said Tomomi Yamaguchi, a professor at Montana State University who studies gender and sexuality in Japan.
The sponsor of the LGBTQ bill, Takeshi Iwaya, said he was wary of the way the shrine group had inserted itself into the current debate.
“I think they are stepping too deep into policy,” said Iwaya, a Liberal Democrat.
Approving the current bill required more moderate Liberal Democrats to expend significant political capital, with some facing severe criticism.
“Every day I get calls asking me to oppose the bill, and the phone won’t stop ringing,” said Tomomi Inada, a former defense minister and Liberal Democratic lawmaker who sponsored the bill two years ago. “There is a lot of pressure. People have tried to tarnish my reelection chances.”
Foreign ambassadors, led by the U.S. envoy, Rahm Emanuel, have spoken out in support of the current LGBTQ bill, as well as same-sex marriage, while pointing to Japanese public support.
“There’s right-wing efforts that are pretty entrenched, and in my own view they kind of punch above their weight class,” Emanuel said. “You can’t get to 70%” public polling support “without some element of self-identified conservative voters who are saying we’re for same-sex marriage.”
But political apathy makes it difficult for gay and transgender advocates to recruit allies.
Voters think “nothing will change, so they are not interested in politics,” said Gon Matsunaka, director of Marriage for All Japan, an advocacy group.

When Water Needs a Recipe: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Brigette Ramirez and her family drove to Houston for a Taylor Swift concert, she made a very important pit stop. Three, actually: T.J. Maxx, T.J. Maxx and T.J. Maxx.
Mx. Ramirez, 33, an 11th-grade U.S. history teacher, was on the hunt for the sugar-free syrups that her fellow flavored-water enthusiasts had cleaned out from the only T.J. Maxx near her home in South Texas.
Her plan was to add them to tap water, pour the concoction into a Stanley tumbler, film herself doing it and (hopefully) go viral on TikTok.
"I ended up finding really good syrups there," she said.
In this latest chapter of America's obsession with hydration, the thirsty are zhuzhing up tap water for all to see on TikTok under the banner of #WaterTok. They show off elaborately organized "water bars" stocked with sugar-free syrups, low-calorie powders flavored like Skittles and Nerds candy, and brightly colored tumblers.
Some have become influencers in the process. Just one of these water mixologists' "recipes" -- three squirts of this, a packet of that -- has the power to significantly drive sales. Several water flavoring companies said they sold out of products in the past few months, and revenue is booming as a result.
"There was a time where our Stur coconut pineapple was sold out for a few weeks because some people were making a Dole Whip drink with it," said Neel Premkumar, the founder of Stur, which sells drink mixes that use natural ingredients.
He said that Stur's revenue has more than doubled in the first four months of this year compared with the last four months of 2022.
Since #WaterTok took off in March, Jordan's Skinny Mixes has sold out of its bright blue, sugar-free Mermaid syrup, with hints of citrus, pineapple and coconut, eight times.
The company was founded 14 years ago and saw growth over the course of the pandemic, said Dana Paris, its chief marketing officer. But #WaterTok "helped bolster Jordan's Skinny Mixes from this secret little brand into more of a household name," she said. In April, e-commerce sales were up 143 percent compared with last year.
Its website opens with a banner acknowledging the trend: "Ride the WAVE as we (and all of TikTok) get hydrated deliciously!" It also includes an apology when a customer goes to order: "NOTICE: EXPECT SHIPMENT DELAY."
In a private Skinny Mixes-dedicated Facebook group, enthusiasts trade tips on where to buy the syrups and exchange water recipes.
Meagan Anderson, an over-40 lifestyle influencer who makes #WaterTok videos and lives outside of Fort Worth, Texas, said people will go to three different stores just to look for flavors.
"Shelves are getting wiped out," said Ms. Anderson, 48.
Sales of Torani's sugar-free coconut syrup have doubled since March, said Andrea Ramirez, the consumer and customer market insight manager. The company has been around since 1925 and is perhaps most famous for its coffee flavorings.
Last month, Ms. Ramirez conducted primary research into the water trend "because it was such a strange phenomenon," she said. She presented her findings with a PowerPoint titled "Let's Talk WATERTOK."
The trend was initially met with mockery across the internet, and critics have dismissed #WaterTok enthusiasts as "hummingbirds," which several influencers said felt sexist.
Those pushing these syrups and powders often have their own affiliate links for products, and the sponsorship component has also inspired some backlash, said Tiffany Ferguson, the creator of the YouTube show "Internet Analysis," in which she dives deep into popular online trends.
"You're like: 'What's in it for you?"' said Ms. Ferguson, 27. "'Why are you so excited? Why are you acting like this water is your church?"'
If #WaterTok is a sect, hydration is a national religion.
In the past decade or so, water-flavoring offerings have exploded in the United States, where Big Soda has dominated the American palate for generations.
These water additive companies frame products -- which are often made with artificial sweeteners and flavorings -- as a way to help people hit their hydration goals. It's Mary Poppins logic: A spoonful of (sugar-free coconut syrup) makes the (tap water) go down.
"For me, I feel like it's drinking my own saliva," said Mx. Ramirez, the history teacher from South Texas, of tap water.
"In my house, we used to be avid Dr Pepper Zero or Diet Coke drinkers," Mx. Ramirez said. "Avid. Like we would buy bulk." Since she switched to flavored water, she said, three cases of soda have sat untouched in the pantry.
#WaterTok is also associated with gastric surgery. Patients are not supposed to drink carbonated beverages after weight-loss surgery, so still flavored drinks can be a hydration tool -- especially for patients who previously relied on soda.
"The whole world is trying to drink more water," said Tonya Spanglo, 45, who had weight-loss surgery three years ago and is arguably the most recognizable face of #WaterTok. "This is just a fun way to do something that we're already doing."
Hydration chatter online is inextricable from diet culture.
The hashtag #WaterTok often nestles up next to #WeightLoss, as influencers lift up hydration as a key tool in their quest to shed pounds. On Monday, the World Health Organization warned against using artificial sweeteners for weight loss, saying that continued consumption could increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mortality in adults.
And one question remains: Is any of it even water?
"I have some pause with regards to calling this 'water,"' said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity medicine physician and scientist at Harvard. "Because it isn't just water."
Water, she helpfully defined, is "what you would expect if you were to take a shower, or wash your hands."
"Water is the base," she said. "But water is the base for soda, too."

Chicken, Noodles and Cash: Paying for Votes in Paraguay: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: In Paraguay, the Colorado Party has held power for seven decades. On Election Day, it rounds up Indigenous people and pays them for their votes.
The Espinillo Indigenous community is 13 miles from the nearest polling station -- and no one in the village has a car.
So two weeks ago, on the eve of Paraguay's election, Miguel Paredes, a retired ambulance driver turned local politician, loaded the Indigenous families onto a bus and brought them to the side of a highway, a short walk from the polls. "We want to look after them," he said, standing watch with six young men he called colleagues.
Then, after dark, The Times found a distinctive type of vote-buying, developed over decades, on blatant display.
Mr. Paredes, 65, and his colleagues gathered some of the Indigenous people and took down their identification numbers. He told them they were to vote for the Colorado Party -- the dominant, right-wing political force in Paraguay -- and to make sure their fellow community members did so, too. The young men then walked the Indigenous people through a simulation of Paraguay's voting machines on a phone, guiding them to vote for Colorado candidates.
With New York Times journalists within earshot, Milner Ruffinelli, one of the young men, slipped into the Indigenous language, Guaraní. "That money that was promised to you, that's all there, too, and Mr. Miguel Paredes is going to see how to get it to you," he said. "We can't give you anything here. You know why."
Democracy is being tested across the planet. In some countries, leaders have attacked democratic institutions, including in the United States, Turkey, Brazil and Mexico, while in other places they have upended the democratic process altogether, as in Russia, Venezuela and Nicaragua.
At the same time, internet disinformation has fed swirling claims of hacked voting machines, dead voters and stolen ballots, undercutting faith in clean elections.
But in many nations, a less visible, but just as pervasive threat continues to afflict free and fair elections: buying votes.
Political parties in Mexico have handed out gift cards, groceries and even washing machines. Election observers said last year's vote in the Philippines was plagued by "blatant vote buying." In February, a politician in Nigeria was caught with $ 500,000 and a list of possible recipients the day before national elections.
Last month in Paraguay, a nation of 7.4 million in the center of South America, The Times witnessed a different, but well-established practice: Political operatives rounded up Indigenous people in Paraguay's remote north and tried to control or purchase their votes.
On the weekend of national elections, The Times witnessed representatives of the ruling Colorado Party attempting to purchase the votes of Indigenous people, and more than a dozen Indigenous people said in interviews that they had accepted money from the party just before voting.
In one case, a Colorado candidate for governor personally handed out 200,000 guaraníes, or nearly $ 30 each, to more than 100 Indigenous voters outside a polling station in the riverside town of Fuerte Olimpo, according to interviews with five Indigenous people who took the money. That amount is equivalent to several weeks' earnings for Paraguay's poorest.
Nestor Rodríguez, chief of the Tomáraho Indigenous community that was given the money, said it was standard. "It's just to buy clothes and things for your family," he said. He voted for that Colorado candidate, Arturo Méndez, because of promises of jobs and a new road, he said.
Mr. Méndez handily won the election. In an interview, he admitted to giving the Indigenous people cash but said it was only because they needed food and clothes, and the government had forgotten them. "Yes, we help them. But not to induce their vote," he said. "It would be heartless not to."
Paying people to vote a certain way is illegal in Paraguay. Many payments are framed as financial assistance, such as money for lunch on Election Day.
In the bordering province of Concepción, where there are 3,000 Indigenous residents, the Colorado candidate won the governorship by just 28 votes. The losing candidate is challenging the results, claiming irregularities in the vote count.
Vote buying can swing local elections, but rarely national ones, said Ryan Carlin, a Georgia State University professor who has studied the issue. Yet it always undermines democracy by "short circuiting the mechanisms of representation and accountability," he said. "If a vote is taken for granted and given in exchange for something else, there's no policy promise on the other end."
Many of Paraguay's roughly 120,000 Indigenous people started integrating into modern society just a few decades ago, and many political parties -- not just the Colorado -- have since sought to control their votes.
In the days leading up to national elections, party workers fan out across the Chaco, a vast, arid region that encompasses Paraguay's northwestern half, where nearly half of the Indigenous live.
At remote communities, the workers load Indigenous people onto buses, take them to fenced-in sites and ply them with meat and beer until the vote, according to election observers, local activists and Indigenous people who have experienced it. The goal is to control a community before a rival party can.
On Election Day, party workers either pay the Indigenous people for their identification cards -- thus restricting them from voting -- or bus them to the polls and hand them cash.
The practice is so entrenched, it has developed its own vocabulary: "herding" the Indigenous voters and putting them in "corrals."
"It's like we're animals to be bought," said Francisco Cáceres, 68, a member of the Qom Indigenous group.
European Union election observers said they witnessed such "corrals" in Paraguay's 2013 and 2018 elections, and saw multiple cases of vote buying in the April 30 election. Parties seek to purchase the votes of many Paraguayans, not just the Indigenous, the observers said.
The practice is part of the robust political machine that has strengthened the Colorado Party's grip on Paraguay, which it has controlled for 71 of the past 76 years, including four decades of military dictatorship.
The Colorado presidential candidate, Santiago Peña, won by 460,000 votes, with 43 percent of the total. (Paraguay has fewer than 80,000 Indigenous adults, according to estimates.) Mr. Peña is the political protégé of Horacio Cartes, a former president and the current party chairman, who was sanctioned this year by the U.S. government over accusations that he had bribed his way to power.
The second- and third-place candidates have suggested that Mr. Peña's victory was rigged, but have not presented clear evidence. The third-place candidate, whose supporters have blocked highways in protest, has been jailed on accusations of attempting to obstruct elections.
In an interview before the election, Mr. Peña said that if vote buying happens, it would not swing races.
"The vote-buying argument doesn't really have much evidence," he said. "It has never been possible to demonstrate a massive purchase scheme. If 2.5 to 3 million people vote, how many votes would we have to buy?"
Still, among Paraguayans, vote buying is an open secret. "It's almost like without it, it's not an election," said the Rev. José Arias, a Catholic priest who uses his sermons to discourage his Indigenous flock from selling its votes. "People agree in theory," he said. "It's just that many who agree also accept" the bribes.
At the highway encampment, Mr. Paredes and Mr. Ruffinelli said they were not handing out bribes. The Colorado Party paid for the bus, as well as chicken, noodles and cooking oil they gave to the community, they said. But they were there because they had built relationships over time, they said, and were pushing Colorado candidates because they were the best for the community.
Everyone was free to vote how they wished, Mr. Ruffinelli said, but he expected them to vote Colorado.
"They already promised," Mr. Ruffinelli said. He rattled off statistics: The Indigenous accounted for 86 percent of the 5,822 registered voters in the local voting precinct. He said he would be analyzing the results to try to ascertain whether "this community betrayed us."
Some in the Enxet Sur community said they would accept money -- but still vote against the Colorados. "If the Colorados come with an offer, we'll grab it, but we know how we're going to vote: for change," said Fermin Chilavert, 61, one of the community's elders.
Others had already taken the money and were planning to vote as asked, including 10 community members who agreed to act as "political operators" for the party on Election Day.
In a late-night meeting, Mr. Paredes and Mr. Ruffinelli explained to the operators that they were to ensure other Indigenous people voted Colorado, including by entering polling booths with them. (Election observers said political parties regularly abuse laws allowing disabled people to be accompanied to the voting booth.)
"You are going to enter with them, you are going to teach them and you are going to tell them where to click," Mr. Paredes said to the Indigenous people, many staring nervously at the ground.
The next morning, Election Day, a truck stop near the polling station was filled with buses. They had ferried hundreds of Indigenous people to vote, and each was adorned with decals of a political party, most for the Colorados.
On one bus with Colorado signs, the Indigenous passengers said they were each given 100,000 to 150,000 guaraníes, or $ 14 to $ 21, and had voted Colorado.
The man running the bus, Catalino Escobar, said the voters were given a stipend to eat. (A sandwich and a Coca-Cola at the gas station cost $ 2.)
"I don't know who the candidate is, to tell you the truth," said Mary Fernanda, 51, who said she accepted 100,000 guaraníes to help feed her children. "I'm only voting out of necessity."
When the votes were counted, the Colorado Party again dominated elections across Paraguay, retaining the presidency and strengthening its control of Congress.
The 19 Indigenous people who ran for national or state seats all lost. Paraguay has never elected anyone who identifies as Indigenous to national office.

A Modern Country Star in a Hybrid Mold: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: NASHVILLE -- The spoils of fame are coming fast for the emerging country star Bailey Zimmerman. The Texas singer-songwriter Cody Johnson gave him a standing offer to come ride horses at his ranch. The Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger flew him on a private plane to his home in Canada to spend some time writing songs. The guitar whiz Gary Clark Jr. and the singing ex-rapper Jelly Roll partied with him backstage at the CMT Awards.
Recently, Kid Rock had him over for dinner at his ranch outside Nashville.
"He freestyled for us at dinner and we went in and he showed us his pool and his bowling alley and all his guns," Zimmerman said last month, still a little awe-struck, enthusiastically sipping a Bacardi and Coke at the bar at Topgolf. "He let me do a TikTok in one of the bars!"
Zimmerman, 23, is boisterous and amiable, openhearted and still a little stupefied by it all. Only two and a half years have passed since he first posted a clip of himself singing one verse of an original song -- his first ever -- to TikTok, went to bed, and woke up to a million views. Now, he's got the No. 1 song at country radio, "Rock and a Hard Place"; is the first opening act on the current Morgan Wallen stadium tour; and is on the cusp of releasing his debut album on Friday, the comfortably bruising and appealingly bruised "Religiously. The Album."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
But this is how Nashville works now, at least sometimes. Social media is increasingly dictating how country music is evolving, and sometimes that's in unexpected, lightly chaotic directions.
"I never wanted to be, like, 'country,"' Zimmerman said earlier that day, at the East Nashville home belonging to his producer Austin Shawn, where he records all of his music, cutting vocals in a closet. "Whatever I want to make that day, that's what I want to be. Some days you'll see me in penny loafers and then sometimes you'll see me in Air Force 1s."
He was indeed wearing Air Force 1s, gray ones. (He started sporting them -- he tries not to wear the same pair twice -- when his manager suggested he needed to step up from the Vans he used to favor.) He'd paired them with a lightly distressed denim jacket and jeans. His longish, tousled hair was swept back under a black cap with a BZ logo (which he'd later sign and give to the Topgolf staff for a charity auction) and a BZ diamond pendant on a chain around his neck.
"You know, I can go to a farm and put boots on and take care of 500 head of cattle and do all that," he said. "But I just don't, like, act 'country' I guess. You know what I'm saying?"
Zimmerman is a modern country star in a hybrid mold. He has a rigorously raspy voice, and sings with power he's mainlined from his primary influences, many of which are rock acts: Nickelback, Three Days Grace, Foo Fighters and, most crucially, the Southern-rock bruisers Hinder -- bands that specialize in puffed-chest emoting. Zimmerman's favorite band is the melodic hard rock outfit Tesla. (He recently enthusiastically posted a video online of the frontman Jeff Keith singing the hook of "Rock and a Hard Place.")
At Topgolf, the music was blasting loudly and the songs Zimmerman had the most electrified reaction to were the pop-punk anthem "My Own Worst Enemy" by the sleaze-rock band Lit, and the unruly glam plosion "Time to Pretend" by MGMT.
But he is also clearly an inheritor of Nashville's recent crop of shaggy-at-the-edges superstars -- singers like the powerhouse Luke Combs, or the genre's reigning titan, Wallen, who have collectively iterated beyond the boyfriend and gentleman country of the mid-2010s, and whose songwriting and commitment to genre mark them as somewhat more traditional than the bro-country breakouts of the early 2010s.
Shawn said that "the door has been opened" by artists like Combs and Wallen, "even people like Zach Bryan and Tyler Childers." Shawn, who produced or co-produced every song on the album, added, "Is he a country singer? Or a rock singer? Or a folk/Americana singer with a little bit of a gritty edge?"
Those lines are blurry in Nashville's contemporary mainstream. Given that pre-existing context, Zimmerman has floated to the top of Nashville's rising class with remarkable ease and speed. The ascent has been even more remarkable given his starting point. Zimmerman is from Louisville, Ill., a town in the Southern part of the state with a population of just over 1,000 and proximate to not much. ("A two-hour drive to get to a mall to go school shopping.") His father owned a trucking business and repossessed vehicles; his mother owned the family car dealership with Zimmerman's grandfather and uncle.
When Zimmerman struck out on his own, he took on some of the hardest physical labor available: working on natural gas pipelines in West Virginia. "The gnarliest most chaotic work," he said. "Screaming, yelling, breaking stuff. Hard hats, walkie talkies, whatever they had in their hands, they'd chuck it at you. Like, you'd walk home with black eyes, bruises from people chucking drinks on you and just belittling you." On one particularly unpleasant assignment, he was fired in a series of events that included a coffee thrown in his face, a broken shovel wielded as a weapon and a brawl in the living room of his abode that smashed the coffee table.
Even still, he maintains a soft spot for the work. "I was so into pipeline, man. Like, I loved working hard. I've always loved working hard. Like, I loved getting my hands dirty and coming home and having oil on my face," he said. "I just felt like, man, there's no possible way I'm going to ever make it out of this. I'm going to be 65, 70 years old, hips broken, back broken, still have nothing to show for it."
He moved home and began custom building lifted trucks -- pickup trucks with super tall wheels -- and posted videos about them on TikTok, eventually amassing a respectable 60,000 followers. In his earliest TikToks, his hair is prim and short, and he has braces on his teeth.
One day in late 2020 Gavin Lucas, a high school acquaintance who wrote songs, heard Zimmerman singing on Snapchat and was impressed. For a couple of weeks, they fiddled around and eventually, on Christmas night, wrote a verse for a new song. The resulting TikTok changed both of their lives -- Zimmerman resigned from his union the following day. Within a couple of weeks, they had finished the song -- the rowdy country-rock number "Never Comin' Home" -- Googled information on how to record songs, and driven to Nashville to cut it in a real studio, splitting the $ 3,000 cost. (Zimmerman borrowed his half from his mother.)
Attention came at a disorienting speed. When Zimmerman first met Chief Zaruk, an industry insider who would become one of his managers, "I thought he was the mayor of Nashville, 'cause that's how everybody introduced him on the Zoom call," Zimmerman said. "I'm just like, man, why is the mayor of Nashville trying to sign me? This makes no sense."
But the kismet continued. "Morgan was one of the first artists I ever met. He was walking up to Big Loud just randomly," Zimmerman said, referring to offices for the label and management company. "And he was like, 'Hey man, I'm a big fan of your song 'Fall in Love.' And I'm like, holy crap!" He continued, "Morgan has just been such a big part of my life since 2015, since 16, 'Up Down,' 'Chain Smokin" and 'Spin You Around.' All that stuff has just been my life."
Last October, he released his debut EP, "Leave the Light On," which remains in the Top 50 of the all-genre Billboard album chart. This is owing to his success at radio, but also to Zimmerman's relentless presence on TikTok and Instagram. He is his own best promoter, and his success underscores how even Nashville, the most hidebound of music industry towns, is increasingly powerless against the tide of social media.
Lucas said that Zimmerman's attitude has been crucial to the speed of his success. "I love how excited he gets and how much he jumps the gun," he said of Zimmerman's no-brakes ascent. "I don't think we'd be where we are today if Bailey wasn't that enthusiastic. I know we wouldn't."
"The TikTok and the Instagram, me doing that every day, that is the brand, of course," Zimmerman said. "That is the company. And now it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, label, hold on. I now have an avenue of my own to make me successful by myself." That said, TikTok provides, and TikTok takes away, as seen in Zimmerman's first true public fumble -- a viral video of him singing woefully off-pitch at a recent concert. But rather than duck it, Zimmerman posted through the embarrassment, apologizing for his misstep and taking his lumps with a sense of humor and as much enthusiasm as when he posts about a new song.
"I heard a saying the other day, and I'm living by that now," he said. "Dogs don't bark at parked cars."
And so he'll keep speeding. Sometimes literally, in the white 2023 Corvette with a red interior that he bought in cash after "Fall in Love" went to No. 1 at country radio, his first splurge. (He also has an even taller truck than his old one that's in the shop being built to spec.)
"I try to keep my sins to a limit, of course, always," he said. "But of course, dude, I cuss every day. I drink, I smoke, I harm my temple." And so he's also taken to the trappings of being a star who needs to perform at a high level -- vitamin IV drips, injections of the anti-inflammatory treatment N.A.D.+ and cryotherapy. He's put both of his parents on his payroll, and is trying to encourage his uncle Brent, whose guitar Zimmerman used to practice on as a child, to become a full-time songwriter.
Unexpected things keep happening to him -- most recently, it's the chaotic cross-genre collaboration on the soundtrack of the upcoming "Fast X" film "Won't Back Down," with the Irish crooner Dermot Kennedy and the prolific rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again, making for a trio of blood-letter vocalists -- but Zimmerman still prefers to operate as if there are no guarantees.
He recalled playing one of his first songs for his father. "You need to chase this," he said his father told him.
"He's like, 'I wasted my whole life not chasing nothing, man. You need to chase something."'

Full text: Jesse Green, the chief theater critic, and Maya Phillips, a critic-at-large, name the shows and artists who they think will win, should win and should have been nominated for this year's Tonys.
We love theater; theater awards, not so much. So take our annual Tony Awards "ballot" (though we don't actually get to vote) with a shaker of salt -- and these caveats.
1. We're not oddsmakers. In the "Will Win" category, we guess what the 769 actual voters will choose. Often they do a great job. Often we don't.
2. We don't mean to suggest that the people and productions listed in the "Should Win" category are more deserving than those in the "Will Win" category. OK, sometimes maybe a little more deserving. But usually they're equally good options.
3. We admit that the "Should Have Been Nominated" category is weird. It salutes work that was eligible for nomination -- but also, indicated by an asterisk, work that wasn't. That includes non-Broadway productions, as long as they opened, like the legit nominees, after May 1, 2022.
4. We know there is no "Best Ensemble" category. But there should be.

Spending On Luxury Up in China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The end of pandemic-era restrictions has unleashed a luxury spending rebound in China. Which Western brands are coming out on top?
This time last year, Shanghai -- China's capital of fashion and luxury -- was in the throes of a ruthlessly enforced Covid lockdown. The city's glittering high-end malls and avenues lined with flagship stores stood practically empty.
Today it is a different story. Huge crowds on a recent weekend flocked to top retail destinations on or near Nanjing Road, the hub of glamour in China ever since the country's first large department stores began to open there in 1917.
"I splurge more extravagantly," Sunny Zhang, 24, said as she waited in line to enter the Chanel store at Plaza 66 mall, where the corridors are lined with shops selling some of the world's most expensive apparel. Ms. Zhang, who works for a consulting firm, used to buy six handbags a year. Now, she purchases up to five handbags a month.
"I change my handbag every day," Ms Zhang added. "I felt that everything was meaningless during the Shanghai lockdown, so we should enjoy the present moment in time."
Many Western fashion and luxury brands have been reaping the benefits of this renewed consumer mind-set. Last month, LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods group by sales, and the owner of brands like Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Company and Dior, posted a 17 percent increase in first-quarter revenue from a year earlier. Fashion and leather goods -- the French company's biggest division -- were up 18 percent, driven in large part by the rebound in China.
Last week, LVMH shares soared to a record high, making it the first European company to surpass $ 500 billion in market value. Its French rival Hermès said sales in Asia (excluding Japan) were up 23 percent in the first quarter, "driven by a very good Chinese New Year."
And Brunello Cucinelli, purveyor of $ 4,000 blazers and the "quiet luxury" trend, posted a 56 percent surge in first-quarter sales. Luca Lisandroni, the Italian brand's co-chief executive, called 2023 "a golden year" for the China market.
Luxury spending in China is bouncing back even faster than the country's overall economy. Retail sales of jewelry, gold and silver soared 37.4 percent in March from a year earlier, more than three times as fast as the rebound in overall retail sales, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. It was by far the biggest March on record for jewelry sales in China; indeed, March was the industry's second-highest sales month ever outside the gift-giving season before Chinese New Year.
"We expect China to be the luxury industry's key growth engine this year, especially given a slight deceleration in other core markets like the U.S. and Korea," Edouard Aubin, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, said on a call last week.
He added that big brands "at the top of the pricing pyramid" with status-symbol value like Chanel, Hermès and Louis Vuitton were outperforming rivals. Those include Gucci and Burberry, both brands that have recently had a change of designer at their helm.
"Much of the initial spend driving the rebound is, for now, less to do with the middle class of China and more to do with rich people spending more," Mr. Aubin said, noting that he expected a resurgence in middle-class spending to kick in later this year.
This desire for big-name luxury in China isn't new. For more than a decade, the country, with 1.4 billion consumers, powered the Western luxury market, contributing as much as a third of market revenue. Two-thirds of that spending took place outside mainland China, as Chinese tourists flocked to Hong Kong, Tokyo, Paris and elsewhere to avoid their country's steep import tariffs and consumption taxes.
But then came 2020, the worst year on record for the industry, as China closed its borders in response to the pandemic. Now, after three years of relying largely on online purchases, many shoppers in China exult in being able to touch fabrics, try on handbags and sunglasses and simply share companionship with others.
In the Zhang Yuan neighborhood, where heavily restored buildings have polished wood frames and elegant stone columns, a crowd gathered and waited outside the Dior store to watch for celebrities. The onlookers did not have to wait long: Annie Yi, the famous Taiwanese singer, walked out of the store accompanied by a young woman who carried a white Dior bag big enough to hold a flat-panel television.
Zoe Zhou, who was at the Dior store looking for a handbag owned by a member of the K-pop band Blackpink, said she had seen a frenzy to buy luxury goods in her home city, Nanjing, with people lining up outside of stores at downtown malls.
"Now that restrictions have been lifted, there are a lot of people buying handbags," said Ms. Zhou, who was disappointed that the bag she wanted was sold out. "You can also go abroad. The price difference between domestic and foreign countries is quite large."
Many luxury brands have raised prices in recent months, notably in China. But traveling outside China remains far more difficult than it was before the pandemic.
Airfares are higher, with a significantly reduced overseas flight schedule. As part of a national security campaign, the Chinese government has made it harder to obtain or renew passports.
As domestic destinations like the duty-free tropical island of Hainan continue to gain popularity, and retail hot spots like Chengdu and Hangzhou continue to emerge, the pivot by Chinese shoppers to buying more domestically is expected to continue. Social media posts about stock shortages and long lines have also become common.
"The domestic recovery may be well underway, but international travel is still far from pre-Covid levels, nor do we think Chinese tourists will be returning at the volumes they once did to Europe any time soon," said Thomas Chauvet, head of luxury goods research at Citi. Short-haul destinations like Hong Kong, Macau and possibly Japan, given the weak Japanese yen, may see the return of Chinese spending sooner, he added.
Not everyone has been coming out on top. Muted quarterly results last week from Kering, the home of Gucci and Balenciaga, reminded investors that a rising tide in China won't necessarily lift all brands. The Paris-based group's revenue grew 1 percent in the first three months of 2023, hampered by a slowdown in its U.S. and wholesale business, the dwindling popularity of Gucci and continuing fallout from a controversial advertising campaign published by Balenciaga at the end of last year.
According to Antoine Belge, an analyst at BNP Paribas Exane, "Strong brands with serious brand desirability are getting stronger."
"Being bigger helps," he added.
The same goes for luxury markets. Claudia D'Arpizio, a senior partner at the consultancy Bain, estimated that the population of middle- and high-income consumers in mainland China will double to 500 million by 2030. By then, she predicted, the country will account for around 40 percent of global luxury purchases.
"While African and Southeast Asian countries might be emerging luxury markets," Ms. D'Arpizio said, "the sheer size of the China luxury market makes it unique and of great strategic importance."

In China, It’s Time to Splurge Again, and the Luxury Industry Is Relieved

This time last year, Shanghai — China’s capital of fashion and luxury — was in the throes of a ruthlessly enforced COVID lockdown. The city’s glittering high-end malls and avenues lined with flagship stores stood practically empty.
Today it is a different story. Huge crowds on a recent weekend flocked to top retail destinations on or near Nanjing Road, the hub of glamour in China ever since the country’s first large department stores began to open there in 1917.
“I splurge more extravagantly,” Sunny Zhang, 24, said as she waited in line to enter the Chanel store at Plaza 66 mall, where the corridors are lined with shops selling some of the world’s most expensive apparel. Zhang, who works for a consulting firm, used to buy six handbags a year. Now she purchases up to five handbags a month.
“I change my handbag every day,” Zhang added. “I felt that everything was meaningless during the Shanghai lockdown, so we should enjoy the present moment in time.”
Many Western fashion and luxury brands have been reaping the benefits of this renewed consumer mindset. Last month, LVMH — the world’s largest luxury goods group by sales, and the owner of brands like Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co. and Dior — posted a 17% increase in first-quarter revenue from a year earlier. Fashion and leather goods — the French company’s biggest division — were up 18%, driven in large part by the rebound in China.
Last week, LVMH shares soared to a record high, making it the first European company to surpass $500 billion in market value. Its French rival Hermès said sales in Asia (excluding Japan) were up 23% in the first quarter, “driven by a very good Chinese New Year.”
And Brunello Cucinelli, purveyor of $4,000 blazers and the “quiet luxury” trend, posted a 56% surge in first-quarter sales. Luca Lisandroni, the Italian brand’s co-CEO, called 2023 “a golden year” for the China market.
Luxury spending in China is bouncing back even faster than the country’s overall economy. Retail sales of jewelry, gold and silver soared 37.4% in March from a year earlier, more than three times as fast as the rebound in overall retail sales, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics. It was by far the biggest March on record for jewelry sales in China; indeed, March was the industry’s second-highest sales month ever outside the gift-giving season before Chinese New Year.
“We expect China to be the luxury industry’s key growth engine this year, especially given a slight deceleration in other core markets like the U.S. and Korea,” Edouard Aubin, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, said on a call last week.
He added that big brands “at the top of the pricing pyramid” with status symbol value like Chanel, Hermès and Louis Vuitton were outperforming rivals. Those include Gucci and Burberry, both brands that have recently had a change of designer at their helm.
“Much of the initial spend driving the rebound is, for now, less to do with the middle class of China and more to do with rich people spending more,” Aubin said, noting that he expected a resurgence in middle-class spending to kick in later this year.
This desire for big-name luxury in China isn’t new. For more than a decade, the country, with 1.4 billion consumers, powered the Western luxury market, contributing as much as one-third of market revenue. Two-thirds of that spending took place outside mainland China, as Chinese tourists flocked to Hong Kong, Tokyo, Paris and elsewhere to avoid their country’s steep import tariffs and consumption taxes.
But then came 2020, the worst year on record for the industry, as China closed its borders in response to the pandemic. Now, after three years of relying largely on online purchases, many shoppers in China exult in being able to touch fabrics, try on handbags and sunglasses and simply share companionship with others.
In the Zhang Yuan neighborhood, where heavily restored buildings have polished wood frames and elegant stone columns, a crowd gathered and waited outside the Dior store to watch for celebrities. The onlookers did not have to wait long: Annie Yi, the famous Taiwanese singer, walked out of the store accompanied by a young woman who carried a white Dior bag big enough to hold a flat-panel television.
Zoe Zhou, who was at the Dior store looking for a handbag owned by a member of the K-pop band Blackpink, said she had seen a frenzy to buy luxury goods in her home city, Nanjing, with people lining up outside stores at downtown malls.
“Now that restrictions have been lifted, there are a lot of people buying handbags,” said Zhou, who was disappointed that the bag she wanted was sold out. “You can also go abroad. The price difference between domestic and foreign countries is quite large.”
Many luxury brands have raised prices in recent months, notably in China. But traveling outside China remains far more difficult than it was before the pandemic.
Airfares are higher, with a significantly reduced overseas flight schedule. As part of a national security campaign, the Chinese government has made it harder to obtain or renew passports.
As domestic destinations like the duty-free tropical island of Hainan continue to gain popularity, and retail hot spots like Chengdu and Hangzhou continue to emerge, the pivot by Chinese shoppers to buying more domestically is expected to continue. Social media posts about stock shortages and long lines have also become common.
“The domestic recovery may be well underway, but international travel is still far from pre-COVID levels, nor do we think Chinese tourists will be returning at the volumes they once did to Europe anytime soon,” said Thomas Chauvet, head of luxury goods research at Citi. Short-haul destinations like Hong Kong, Macao and possibly Japan, given the weak Japanese yen, may see the return of Chinese spending sooner, he added.

For Top Horses, the Real Money Is in Retirement: [National Desk]

Full text: VERSAILLES, Ky. -- Flightline had put on 100 pounds in the five months since the end of his brief but astonishing racing career. He was still light on his feet, though, as he high-stepped into a breeding shed last month as if he were on a red carpet. A mare named Bernina Star shuffled before him.
Her bloodlines were aristocratic, her racing record impressive. After her career, she fetched $ 1.2 million at auction to do what she was about to do.
Bernina Star whinnied. Flightline rocked high onto his back legs. The two tangoed and tangled, oblivious to the man holding the mare's tail or the two other chaperones circling this tryst.
Soon, Flightline's tail dropped like a flag on a windless day. He fell back to earth. It was time for a bath, and then a night out in the bluegrass.
If the Kentucky Derby is considered the most exciting two minutes in sports, this was perhaps the most lucrative 52.48 seconds in sports. Bernina Star's owner paid $ 200,000 for (not quite) a minute of Flightline's time.
That payday explains why the greatest horses in racing -- including, in all likelihood, the winner of Saturday's Derby -- are destined to have short careers, and why fans can't enjoy the best horses for long. The economics of modern horse racing practically guarantee it.
On the racetrack, it took Flightline two years and six undefeated races to earn $ 4.5 million in purses. Doing what came naturally twice a day in the breeding shed, he matched that total in 11 days, doubled it in 22 and, with 155 mares in his date book, will have generated $ 31 million in earnings by the end of the five-month breeding in July.
In a sport perpetually troubled by doping scandals, the frequent and mysterious deaths of its athletes, competition from other kinds of gambling and waning interest among fans, it is a counterintuitive choice to retire him. Just last November, at 4 years old, Flightline was the most exciting thoroughbred in the world. He had won all of his six races by a combined 71 lengths and brought large crowds to see him soar around racetracks like Pegasus.
Imagine LeBron James being pushed into coaching after his second season in the N.B.A. The racing industry has done something like that with Flightline.
"You can work through it and justify it by recognizing that he's a special talent and you hope he can replicate it and produce fast horses in the future," said Terry Finley, the founder and president of West Point Thoroughbreds, one of the five entities that own Flightline.
But Finley conceded that this thinking comes at a cost to fan enthusiasm: "No, it's not good for the game."
The Sport of Kings and Diamond Jim Brady
Thoroughbred racing in the United States has a rich and tawdry history that has often mirrored that of the nation. In 1823, Eclipse met Sir Henry in a match race that pitted North versus South, an early window into the regional bitterness that would lead to the Civil War.
The sport has produced folk heroes like Seabiscuit during the Depression, ethereal wonders like Secretariat, the 1973 Triple Crown winner, and Runyonesque gamblers like Pittsburgh Phil and Diamond Jim Brady and modern-day race fixers who got corralled by the feds.
If there is a principle that unifies the sport, it is the inclination -- no, commitment -- to always take the money.
In Central Kentucky, the money is atop purple-flowered bluegrass that is framed by plank fences and pulled like a canvas over gently rolling hills. Farm roads weave between weather-vaned barns and stately homes. In between are horses as far as you can see.
Foals figuring out the stilts that are their legs. Hungry weanlings trailing after their full-figured mothers. Broad-shouldered stallions languidly patrolling their expansive paddocks like beat cops long after everyone has gone home.
Flightline lives at Lane's End Farm in a five-acre paddock, a tiny patch of lawn on a 2,000-acre spread.
He takes his turn in the breeding shed with 20 other stallions. Seventy-seven yearlings zigzag in paddocks like the rambunctious adolescents they are. More than 200 mares -- some pregnant, others nursing new foals -- bring life to this horsy Brigadoon.
Lane's End and its neighbors are at the center of a $ 6.5 billion industry that puts 61,000 people to work on more than 831,000 acres. But for how long?
Horse racing has been declining for decades. In 2002, more than $ 15 billion was bet on races in the United States; last year, the handle fell to $ 12 billion. In 2000, nearly 33,000 thoroughbred foals were registered, almost double the number from last year.
Still, the competition to create a generational talent like Flightline has never been fiercer.
Breeding to Race or Breeding to Breed?
Horsemen and horsewomen have tried for centuries to breed champion thoroughbreds, relying on a combination of science, intuition and luck. "Breed the best to the best and hope for the best" has been the prayer murmured for generations.
In horse racing's golden age, the Whitneys, the Vanderbilts and business titans like the textile manufacturer Samuel Riddle bred horses primarily to race. In 1919 and 1920, Riddle's Man o' War won 20 of 21 races. When Man o' War was sent to the breeding barn, Riddle restricted his book to about 25 mares a year, most owned by him or his friends and family.
The 1941 Triple Crown champion, Whirlaway, made 60 starts in his career. The first 11 Triple Crown winners together made 104 starts at age 4 or older, and won 57 of them.
In 1973, one of them, Secretariat, was syndicated for a then-record $ 6.08 million. He was retired as a 3-year-old after winning 16 of his 21 starts, kick-starting the retail era of breeding.
The last two Triple Crown champions -- American Pharoah in 2015 and Justify in 2018 -- were also retired at 3, but after running far fewer races than Secretariat. American Pharoah's stallion rights were bought for $ 30 million after the colt went 9 of 11 as a 2- and 3-year-old. Justify brought $ 60 million after only six races, all as a 3-year-old.
Craig Bernick, president of Glen Hill Farm in Ocala, Fla., is from a prominent racing family. He tries to adhere to his grandfather's model: Breed your mares, keep and race the fillies and sell the colts at auction.
"He was a traditional sportsman," Bernick said of his grandfather Leonard Lavin, who founded the beauty products company Alberto-Culver, which Unilever bought in 2010. "I wish there were more like him and I could be like that today. But now I must be more commercial. I need to invest in stallion shares and take some of my yearlings to auction in Europe."
The hurry to get horses to the stallion barn has had unintended consequences in an agribusiness that is contracting: accelerated inbreeding.
While the number of broodmares has remained consistent, the stallion population has dwindled. In 1991, Kentucky had 499 stallions whose books averaged 29.9 mares a year. Last year, Kentucky had 200 registered stallions who averaged 84 mares a year. Many argue that this is not sustainable.
Three years ago, the Jockey Club, which keeps the breed registry, cited scientific studies that showed the thoroughbred gene pool was getting too shallow, endangering the breed. It tried to cap the number of mares a stallion could impregnate at 140. The rule was challenged in court by three farms that collectively stood 16 stallions that bred more than 140 mares each in 2020. One of the farms, Coolmore, also shuttles some of its stallions to Australia to breed another 50 to 100 mares in the Southern Hemisphere.
Last year, the Jockey Club abandoned the rule after the Kentucky legislature, swayed by lobbyists for some commercial breeders, proposed a bill that prohibited the cap and would have put the state racing commission in charge of the registry for Kentucky-bred thoroughbreds.
Bill Farish, the owner of Lane's End, supported the rule even though the farm stands stallions that breed more than 140 mares.
"It's just simple math to me," said Farish, who also has an interest in Flightline. "Maybe my brain works too simply. But if you have half the number of stallions breeding a similar number of mares, it's got to be shrinking the pool."
'We All Know We're Screwing It Up'
Mike Repole was on the phone. No, make that two phones.
On one, he was barking orders at his bloodstock agent, who was in Ocala, bidding on a filly in a 2-year-old-in-training sale.
"Go to 280K," Repole told the agent. "Good."
Someone bid $ 290,000.
"Hit them right back," Repole said, his voice tightening. "Be quicker. Show them we want this one."
Soon, the gavel dropped at $ 310,000 and Repole Stable owned another horse.
On the other call, with a reporter, Repole tried to explain the dysfunction of horse racing.
Repole grew up in Middle Village, Queens, and spent ample time on the rail at Aqueduct, the bluest collar of racetracks. He got into the beverage business, building first Vitaminwater and then BodyArmor sports drink into brands attractive enough for Coca-Cola to purchase for nearly $ 10 billion.
Repole has spent more than $ 300 million buying horses. He has won dozens of the most prestigious stakes races -- including the Belmont on Long Island and the Travers in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. He developed a colt named Uncle Mo into one of the sport's most accomplished stallions.
On Saturday, he will host 75 family members and friends in Louisville, Ky., at the 149th running of the Derby, where Forte -- a colt he co-owns -- is the 3-1 favorite.
Repole is confounded by horse racing's resistance to change and its unwillingness to embrace best practices. For example, if Forte wins the Derby -- the first of the Triple Crown races -- he will race two weeks later in the second leg, the Preakness in Baltimore. If he doesn't, he will skip the Preakness to get some rest and return to the track five weeks later at Belmont Park.
"I'm all for tradition, but wouldn't it be better for the horses if there was more time between races?" he asked. "If the Derby was in May, the Preakness in June and Belmont in July, you would have bigger fields with better horses to get fans excited."
He has compared horse racing to a poorly run restaurant with a fabulous menu.
"You know the service is bad and you don't like the room, but once you get there the food is just so good," Repole said.
He has campaigned for a national league office -- a central authority that could bring racetracks, owners, trainers and breeders together on important issues.
"We all know we're screwing it up," Repole said. "Horse racing is like a board game with no directions. I'm one of the biggest owners and I don't know where to go when I have a problem. There is a selfishness built into the game. Everyone treats it like a secret club when we should be sharing and celebrating it."
In six months or so, Repole and Forte's co-owner, the Florida Panthers owner Vincent Viola, will decide whether to keep Forte on the racetrack or follow the sport's unifying principle and take the money by sending him to the barn.
A Comfortable Retirement
For Flightline's owners, there is no looking back. By the time Flightline's first offspring hit the racetrack in 2026, he will have generated more than $ 120 million in revenue.
If they are fast and win races, his stallion fee is likely to rise. America's leading sire, Into Mischief, is 18 years old and commands $ 250,000 a mating. If Flightline is unable to consistently pass on his extraordinary speed, his price will be adjusted down.
Either way, if Flightline stays healthy, he will be an equine A.T.M. for the ages.
In Flightline's racing days, he was so excited to run that his trainer had to take him to the track at 3 a.m. each day so he wouldn't kick down his stall. Knowing this, the horse's owners went to great expense to put thick pads in his retirement stall so he wouldn't hurt himself.
The pads don't have a mark on them.
Flightline likes what he does -- so much so that in the first couple weeks of his new career, he refused to leave the breeding shed long after goodbyes were exchanged.

The Met's Fine Line on Lagerfeld: [Review]

Author: Friedman, Vanessa

Publication info: Friedman, Vanessa.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "A Line of Beauty" focuses on dualities in the dazzling work of the legendary designer, but it is coy about the controversies.
I admit: I never entirely drank the Karl Lagerfeld Kool-Aid. I was not one of those critics (and there were some) who would clutch their breast, shriek "genius!" and swoon after every show.
I often felt that for every extraordinary piece the designer created for Chanel or Fendi -- by the time I started in fashion, his career at Chloé was at an end -- there would be another clunker of a dress or a suit: unflattering, frumpy, kind of awkward. I found the set-building he did for his Chanel shows in the latter years (the supermarkets, rocket ships and icebergs in the Grand Palais) not just a smart social media move (which it was) but too often an egregious display of a bottomless budget and sleight of hand to distract from what was on the runway. Sure, that tweed sweatsuit made that model look like a Real Housewife -- but everyone was looking at the double-C branded pasta on the faux megamart shelf instead!
Once I got spoken to by the Chanel press office for not fully "understanding" Lagerfeld's vision. But as I wrote in the designer's obituary (he died in 2019), while he unquestionably changed the business of the industry -- its marketing, its branding, its very structure -- thanks to his ability to take on a heritage house like Chanel and reinvent it with the detritus of its own codes, I didn't think he really changed wardrobes. He didn't give the world a new silhouette, or an expression of identity, the way Coco Chanel herself did, with the bouclé suit, or Christian Dior, with the New Look, or Saint Laurent, with Le Smoking, the tuxedo suit for women.
All of which is to say that when I heard the Metropolitan Museum of Art would be dedicating its 2023 Costume Institute show to Lagerfeld, I had a mixed reaction. On one hand it made sense: In a 65-year career, which included 26 years at Chanel, 54 at Fendi, 25 at Chloé (in two separate stints), and 35 at his own brand (for years he juggled multiple jobs at the same time), plus stints at Patou and Balmain (phew), the man loomed like a colossus over the modern fashion landscape. On the other hand, the show raised a lot of questions.
The bar is very high for one-person exhibitions -- usually defined by names that changed the vocabulary of dress. There have only been 10 of them at the Met in the last 50 years, including Balenciaga, Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen and most recently, Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons. Generally, the Costume Institute has focused on thematic displays, like last year's show on American fashion, or 2019's "Camp." And even beyond the questions of Lagerfeld's actual products, there were the issues of his public statements, a number of which were fatphobic, Islamophobic, racist and sexist, deriding everyone from Angela Merkel, the former chancellor of Germany, to the singer Adele.
Should he really be put on a museum pedestal, his art (if that is what it was) separated from his self?
An answer of sorts can now be found in "Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty," which opens May 5 in the museum's Tisch Galleries. It is a tightly edited, highly enjoyable, ultimately convincing argument from the Costume Institute's curator in charge, Andrew Bolton, that when you strip away the controversies and the mythology, what you are left with is a pure expression of a great technical imagination combined with an omnivorous cultural curiosity. The advantage of 65 years of work that produced over 10,000 pieces of clothing (at least that's the number Bolton said he perused for the show) is that in distilling them down to just over 200 garments, Bolton is free to focus on the most evocative pieces. And they are almost all, indeed, dazzling.
But the exhibition also fails entirely, and deliberately, to address the complications of the man. Bolton admits as much in the introduction to the exhibition's catalog. "We did not want to emphasize 'Lagerfeld the man,"' he writes, but rather "Lagerfeld the designer"; to find the connective tissue in a 65-year career that could often seem profligate in the extreme: flitting here, there and everywhere; reluctant to commit. In an interview this week, the curator elaborated on his stance, saying he wanted to leave the judgments on character to historians and biographers. And yet Lagerfeld the man is also the ghost in the machine of the show: impossible to ignore.
Indeed, the concept around which the exhibition itself is built -- a narrative of dualities -- implies the paradox at the heart of the Lagerfeld story: He was a man who loved, and made, beautiful things while sometimes blithely giving voice to ugliness.
If not officially a retrospective -- Lagerfeld famously hated them, saying no one wanted to "look at a bunch of old dresses" -- the show is more like an essay in clothes, based on an organizing principle derived from the 18th-century artist and writer William Hogarth's 1753 book "The Analysis of Beauty," with the author's beloved Serpentine curve, or "line of beauty," which signified liveliness and variety, juxtaposed against the straight line, which Lagerfeld also prized, as the dueling forces in his aesthetic. ("The Line of Beauty" is also, as it happens, a 2004 Booker Prize-winning novel by the British writer Alan Hollinghurst about gay life, class and politics in Thatcherite Britain, but though Bolton acknowledged that he loved the book, he said it had nothing to do with the exhibition.)
From there the lines and dualities proliferate in nine different groupings: the masculine/feminine lines giving way to the romantic/military influences, which give way to the rococo/classical, which in turn lead to the historical/futuristic and so on and on. There are so many lines they can be hard to follow; Bolton has a tendency to over-egg his theses, perhaps to justify fashion's place in the museum. In the end you can ignore them all, and enjoy the show purely as a visual feast.
The line conceit proves most useful in providing a template for the show's designer, the architect Tadao Ando (who was once commissioned to create a house for Lagerfeld that was never built). The space is composed of multiple galleries that undulate and curve around on themselves with little openings through which other galleries can be glimpsed -- to allow peeks forward into the future, or back to the past. The effect is slightly disorienting in a good way, making it easy to lose oneself in the fields of Lagerfeldiana.
And what fields they are. Two little tweed Chanel lunching suits seem to vaporize into mist at the hems. An egg-shaped Fendi coat is composed of thousands of tiny brightly colored mink mosaic tiles, like a pointillist painting; another, strafed by overlapping shades made of layers of scrunched-up tulle that only look like fur. Lagerfeld could see possibilities in material that seemed otherwise inconceivable; he minted sequins out of concrete, and wood.
There are Chloé dresses in Sonia Delaunay-esque prints and trompe l'oeil Grecian drapes. A Chanel frock coat is cut away not at the front but at the back, to expose frothing iridescent tiers. There are almost no logos in sight (a fun game is: guess which look goes with which brand; all three of his main employers were show sponsors), just as there is little of the kitschy play with brand iconography that helped make Chanel a part of pop culture -- the double-C boxing gloves, and bikinis -- and that has been widely imitated at other brands. But there are cumulus clouds of feathers and blossoming rosettes made of lace and gleaming sequin armor that romp across centuries and salons.
Through it all, one shape appears again and again: the jacket pinched just a bit at the spine, so the shoulder blades roll up and back, raising the arm hole just so, with the line curving down over the waist. Bolton calls this the "Schlemmer shape," after an Oskar Schlemmer painting, "Bauhaus Stairway" from 1932 (the period between the wars in Germany having been one of Lagerfeld's gravitational poles).
Ditto the sketches that were Lagerfeld's primary means of communication, and are displayed with garments as their origin story. The designer would hand these drawings, which were conceived in the round (he thought not just from the front, but from the back) to the heads of his ateliers, to be "read" like their own private language. Just how that worked is enlivened by a group of absorbing videos created by the documentary filmmaker Loïc Prigent that are interviews with those premières d'atelier -- the people who translated the designer's sketches -- about their work with Lagerfeld. They exude humanity, affection and pride.
As it happens, the videos are shown in the exhibition's first gallery. You reach them after an entrance antechamber with another video, this one a close-up of Lagerfeld's hands sketching a dress, along one wall; at the end of the room, like a punctuation mark, is a reconstruction of Lagerfeld's Chanel desk, piled high with books and papers (each element chosen by Bolton to represent the breadth of Lagerfeld's various obsessions, from Aubrey Beardsley to Diet Coke). Next to the desk is a pair of the designer's black shoes, sitting empty on the floor. This opening video and desk mirror the exhibition's close: another video of Lagerfeld's hands, sketching -- this time not dresses, but himself. Catty-corner to that visual are a set of vitrines displaying the designer's signature accessories: the fingerless black leather gloves, black shades and fan, that were the artifacts of the character he constructed for himself. Or "caricature," as he called it.
Just before that, however, is a small ellipse of a room lined with 80 iPhones plus one at the center, all loaded with the same video of Lagerfeld laughing, as well as some of his most famous quotes: "I have one instinct that is stronger than all others: the survival instinct"; "I always say what I think, and sometimes even what I don't." None of the bad ones, of course, though the latter statement seems particularly telling.
It's a lost opportunity. Because by choosing to sandwich the clothes between representations of the man, the show actually suggests you can't separate that man, in all his messy, uncomfortable reality, from the alchemy of his art -- and you shouldn't. That mess and discomfort is part of the mix; it's part of the legacy, as it is for many of our most formative figures. If the Met can't encourage that public conversation, what institution can?
Lagerfeld once said, in a quote that is inscribed over the entrance to the show, "Fashion does not belong in a museum." This exhibition makes a glorious case that the clothes he made really do. But so, too, do the complications, and the tension.

VERSAILLES, Ky. — Flightline had put on 100 pounds in the five months since the end of his brief but astonishing racing career. He was still light on his feet, though, as he high-stepped into a breeding shed last month as if he were on a red carpet. A mare named Bernina Star shuffled before him.
Her bloodlines were aristocratic, her racing record impressive. After her career, she fetched $1.2 million at auction to do what she was about to do.
Bernina Star whinnied. Flightline rocked high onto his back legs. The two tangoed and tangled, oblivious to the man holding the mare’s tail or the two other chaperones circling this tryst.
Soon, Flightline’s tail dropped like a flag on a windless day. He fell back to earth. It was time for a bath and then a night out in the bluegrass.
If the Kentucky Derby is considered the most exciting two minutes in sports, this was perhaps the most lucrative 52.48 seconds in sports. Bernina Star’s owner paid $200,000 for (not quite) a minute of Flightline’s time.
That payday explains why the greatest horses in racing — including, in all likelihood, the winner of Saturday’s Derby — are destined to have short careers and why fans can’t enjoy the best horses for long. The economics of modern horse racing practically guarantee it.
On the racetrack, it took Flightline two years and six undefeated races to earn $4.5 million in purses. Doing what came naturally twice a day in the breeding shed, he matched that total in 11 days, doubled it in 22 and, with 155 mares in his date book, will have generated $31 million in earnings by the end of the five-month breeding in July.
In a sport perpetually troubled by doping scandals, the frequent and mysterious deaths of its athletes, competition from other kinds of gambling and waning interest among fans, it is a counterintuitive choice to retire him. Just last November, at 4 years old, Flightline was the most exciting thoroughbred in the world. He had won all of his six races by a combined 71 lengths and brought large crowds to see him soar around racetracks like Pegasus.
Imagine LeBron James being pushed into coaching after his second season in the NBA. The racing industry has done something like that with Flightline.
“You can work through it and justify it by recognizing that he’s a special talent, and you hope he can replicate it and produce fast horses in the future,” said Terry Finley, the founder and president of West Point Thoroughbreds, one of the five entities that owns Flightline.
But Finley conceded that this thinking comes at a cost to fan enthusiasm: “No, it’s not good for the game.”
The Sport of Kings and Diamond Jim Brady
Thoroughbred racing in the United States has a rich and tawdry history that has often mirrored that of the nation. In 1823, Eclipse met Sir Henry in a match race that pitted North versus South, an early window into the regional bitterness that would lead to the Civil War.
The sport has produced folk heroes like Seabiscuit during the Depression, ethereal wonders like Secretariat, the 1973 Triple Crown winner, and Runyonesque gamblers like Pittsburgh Phil and Diamond Jim Brady and modern-day race fixers who got corralled by the feds.
If there is a principle that unifies the sport, it is the inclination — no, commitment — to always take the money.
In Central Kentucky, the money is atop purple-flowered bluegrass that is framed by plank fences and pulled like a canvas over gently rolling hills. Farm roads weave between weather-vaned barns and stately homes. In between are horses as far as you can see.
Foals figuring out the stilts that are their legs. Hungry weanlings trailing after their full-figured mothers. Broad-shouldered stallions languidly patrolling their expansive paddocks like beat cops long after everyone has gone home.
Flightline lives at Lane’s End Farm in a 5-acre paddock, a tiny patch of lawn on a 2,000-acre spread.
He takes his turn in the breeding shed with 20 other stallions. Seventy-seven yearlings zigzag in paddocks like the rambunctious adolescents they are. More than 200 mares — some pregnant, others nursing new foals — bring life to this horsy Brigadoon.
Lane’s End and its neighbors are at the center of a $6.5 billion industry that puts 61,000 people to work on more than 831,000 acres. But for how long?
Horse racing has been declining for decades. In 2002, more than $15 billion was bet on races in the United States; last year, the handle fell to $12 billion. In 2000, nearly 33,000 thoroughbred foals were registered, almost double the number from last year.
Still, the competition to create a generational talent like Flightline has never been fiercer.
Breeding to Race or Breeding to Breed?
Horsemen and horsewomen have tried for centuries to breed champion thoroughbreds, relying on a combination of science, intuition and luck. “Breed the best to the best and hope for the best” has been the prayer murmured for generations.
In horse racing’s golden age, the Whitneys, the Vanderbilts and business titans like textile manufacturer Samuel Riddle bred horses primarily to race. In 1919 and 1920, Riddle’s Man o’ War won 20 of 21 races. When Man o’ War was sent to the breeding barn, Riddle restricted his book to about 25 mares a year, most owned by him or his friends and family.
The 1941 Triple Crown champion, Whirlaway, made 60 starts in his career. The first 11 Triple Crown winners together made 104 starts at age 4 or older and won 57 of them.
In 1973, one of them, Secretariat, was syndicated for a then-record $6.08 million. He was retired as a 3-year-old after winning 16 of his 21 starts, kick-starting the retail era of breeding.
The last two Triple Crown champions — American Pharoah in 2015 and Justify in 2018 — were also retired at 3, but after running far fewer races than Secretariat. American Pharoah’s stallion rights were bought for $30 million after the colt went 9 of 11 as a 2- and 3-year-old. Justify brought $60 million after only six races, all as a 2-year-old.
Craig Bernick, president of Glen Hill Farm in Ocala, Florida, is from a prominent racing family. He tries to adhere to his grandfather’s model: Breed your mares, keep and race the fillies, and sell the colts at auction.
“He was a traditional sportsman,” Bernick said of his grandfather Leonard Lavin, who founded the beauty products company Alberto-Culver, which Unilever bought in 2010. “I wish there were more like him and I could be like that today. But now I must be more commercial. I need to invest in stallion shares and take some of my yearlings to auction in Europe.”
The hurry to get horses to the stallion barn has had unintended consequences in an agribusiness that is contracting: accelerated inbreeding.
While the number of broodmares has remained consistent, the stallion population has dwindled. In 1991, Kentucky had 499 stallions whose books averaged 29.9 mares a year. Last year, Kentucky had 200 registered stallions who averaged 84 mares a year. Many argue that this is not sustainable.
Three years ago, the Jockey Club, which keeps the breed registry, cited scientific studies that showed the thoroughbred gene pool was getting too shallow, endangering the breed. It tried to cap the number of mares a stallion could impregnate at 140. The rule was challenged in court by three farms that collectively stood 16 stallions that bred more than 140 mares each in 2020. One of the farms, Coolmore, also shuttles some of its stallions to Australia to breed another 50 to 100 mares in the Southern Hemisphere.
Last year, the Jockey Club abandoned the rule after the Kentucky Legislature, swayed by lobbyists for some commercial breeders, proposed a bill that prohibited the cap and would have put the state racing commission in charge of the registry for Kentucky-bred thoroughbreds.
Bill Farish, the owner of Lane’s End, supported the rule even though the farm stands stallions that breed more than 140 mares.
“It’s just simple math to me,” said Farish, who also has an interest in Flightline. “Maybe my brain works too simply. But if you have half the number of stallions breeding a similar number of mares, it’s got to be shrinking the pool.”
‘We All Know We’re Screwing It Up’
Mike Repole was on the phone. No, make that two phones.
On one, he was barking orders at his bloodstock agent, who was in Ocala, bidding on a filly in a 2-year-old-in-training sale.
“Go to 280K,” Repole told the agent. “Good.”
Someone bid $290,000.
“Hit them right back,” Repole said, his voice tightening. “Be quicker. Show them we want this one.”
Soon, the gavel dropped at $310,000, and Repole Stable owned another horse.
On the other call, with a reporter, Repole tried to explain the dysfunction of horse racing.
Repole grew up in New York City and spent ample time on the rail at Aqueduct, the bluest collar of racetracks. He got into the beverage business, building first Vitaminwater and then BodyArmor sports drink into brands attractive enough for Coca-Cola to purchase for nearly $10 billion.
Repole has spent more than $300 million buying horses. He has won dozens of the most prestigious stakes races — including the Belmont on Long Island and the Travers in Saratoga Springs, New York. He developed a colt named Uncle Mo into one of the sport’s most accomplished stallions.
On Saturday, he will host 75 family members and friends in Louisville, Kentucky, at the 149th running of the Derby, where Forte — a colt he co-owns — is the 3-1 favorite.
Repole is confounded by horse racing’s resistance to change and its unwillingness to embrace best practices. For example, if Forte wins the Derby — the first of the Triple Crown races — he will race two weeks later in the second leg, the Preakness in Baltimore. If he doesn’t, he will skip the Preakness to get some rest and return to the track five weeks later at Belmont Park.
“I’m all for tradition, but wouldn’t it be better for the horses if there was more time between races?” he asked. “If the Derby was in May, the Preakness in June and Belmont in July, you would have bigger fields with better horses to get fans excited.”
He has compared horse racing to a poorly run restaurant with a fabulous menu.
“You know the service is bad, and you don’t like the room, but once you get there, the food is just so good,” Repole said.
He has campaigned for a national league office — a central authority that could bring racetracks, owners, trainers and breeders together on important issues.
“We all know we’re screwing it up,” Repole said. “Horse racing is like a board game with no directions. I’m one of the biggest owners, and I don’t know where to go when I have a problem. There is a selfishness built into the game. Everyone treats it like a secret club when we should be sharing and celebrating it.”
In six months or so, Repole and Forte’s co-owner, Florida Panthers owner Vincent Viola, will decide whether to keep Forte on the racetrack or follow the sport’s unifying principle and take the money by sending him to the barn.
A Comfortable Retirement
For Flightline’s owners, there is no looking back. By the time Flightline’s first offspring hit the racetrack in 2026, he will have generated more than $120 million in revenue.
If they are fast and win races, his stallion fee is likely to rise. America’s leading sire, Into Mischief, is 18 years old and commands $250,000 a mating. If Flightline is unable to consistently pass on his extraordinary speed, his price will be adjusted down.
Either way, if Flightline stays healthy, he will be an equine ATM for the ages.
In Flightline’s racing days, he was so excited to run that his trainer had to take him to the track at 3 a.m. each day so he wouldn’t kick down his stall. Knowing this, the horse’s owners went to great expense to put thick pads in his retirement stall so he wouldn’t hurt himself.
The pads don’t have a mark on them.
Flightline likes what he does — so much so that in the first couple weeks of his new career, he refused to leave the breeding shed long after goodbyes were exchanged.

The Met Walks a Fine Line on Lagerfeld: Judge the Clothes, Not the Man

NEW YORK — I admit: I never entirely drank the Karl Lagerfeld Kool-Aid. I was not one of those critics (and there were some) who would clutch their breast, shriek “Genius!” and swoon after every show.
I often felt that for every extraordinary piece the designer created for Chanel or Fendi — by the time I started in fashion, his career at Chloé was at an end — there would be another clunker of a dress or a suit: unflattering, frumpy, kind of awkward. I found the set-building he did for his Chanel shows in the latter years (the supermarkets, rocket ships and icebergs in the Grand Palais) not just a smart social media move (which it was) but too often an egregious display of a bottomless budget and sleight of hand to distract from what was on the runway. Sure, that tweed sweatsuit made that model look like a Real Housewife — but everyone was looking at the double-C branded pasta on the faux megamart shelf instead!
Once I got spoken to by the Chanel press office for not fully “understanding” Lagerfeld’s vision. But as I wrote in the designer’s obituary (he died in 2019), although he unquestionably changed the business of the industry — its marketing, its branding, its very structure — thanks to his ability to take on a heritage house such as Chanel and reinvent it with the detritus of its own codes, I didn’t think he really changed wardrobes . He didn’t give the world a new silhouette, or an expression of identity, the way Coco Chanel herself did, with the boucle suit, or Christian Dior, with the New Look, or Saint Laurent, with Le Smoking, the tuxedo suit for women.
All of which is to say that when I heard the Metropolitan Museum of Art would be dedicating its 2023 Costume Institute to Lagerfeld, I had a mixed reaction. On one hand, it made sense: In a 65-year career, which included 26 years at Chanel, 54 at Fendi, 25 at Chloé (in two separate stints), and 35 at his own brand (for years he juggled multiple jobs at the same time), plus stints at Patou and Balmain (phew), the man loomed like a colossus over the modern fashion landscape. On the other hand, the show raised a lot of questions.
The bar is very high for one-person exhibitions — usually defined by names that changed the vocabulary of dress. There have been only 10 of them at the Met in the past 50 years, including Balenciaga, Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen and, most recently, Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons. Generally, the Costume Institute has focused on thematic displays, such as last year’s show on American fashion or 2019’s “Camp.” And even beyond the questions of Lagerfeld’s actual products, there were the issues of his public statements, a number of which were fatphobic, Islamophobic, racist and sexist, deriding everyone from Angela Merkel, former chancellor of Germany, to singer Adele.
Should he really be put on a museum pedestal, his art (if that is what it was) separated from his self?
An answer of sorts can now be found in “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,” which opens Friday in the museum’s Tisch Galleries. It is a tightly edited, highly enjoyable, ultimately convincing argument from the Costume Institute’s curator in charge, Andrew Bolton, that when you strip away the controversies and the mythology, what you are left with is a pure expression of a great technical imagination combined with an omnivorous cultural curiosity. The advantage of 65 years of work that produced more than 10,000 pieces of clothing (at least, that’s the number Bolton said he perused for the show) is that in distilling them down to just more than 200 garments, Bolton is free to focus on the most evocative pieces. And they are almost all, indeed, dazzling.
But the exhibition also fails entirely, and deliberately, to address the complications of the man. Bolton admits as much in the introduction to the exhibition’s catalog: “We did not want to emphasize ‘Lagerfeld the man,’” he writes, but rather “Lagerfeld the designer”; to find the connective tissue in a 65-year career that could often seem profligate in the extreme: flitting here, there and everywhere; reluctant to commit. In an interview this week, Bolton elaborated on his stance, saying he wanted to leave the judgments on character to historians and biographers. And yet, Lagerfeld the man is also the ghost in the machine of the show: impossible to ignore.
Indeed, the concept around which the exhibition itself is built — a narrative of dualities — implies the paradox at the heart of the Lagerfeld story: He was a man who loved, and made, beautiful things while sometimes blithely giving voice to ugliness.
If not officially a retrospective — Lagerfeld famously hated them, saying no one wanted to “look at a bunch of old dresses” — the show is more like an essay in clothes, based on an organizing principle derived from 18th-century artist and writer William Hogarth’s 1753 book “The Analysis of Beauty,” with the author’s beloved Serpentine curve, or “line of beauty,” which signified liveliness and variety, juxtaposed against the straight line, which Lagerfeld also prized, as the dueling forces in his aesthetic. (“The Line of Beauty” is also, as it happens, a 2004 Booker Prize-winning novel by British writer Alan Hollinghurst about gay life, class and politics in Thatcherite Britain, but although Bolton acknowledged that he loved the book, he said it had nothing to do with the exhibition.)
From there, the lines and dualities proliferate in nine different groupings: the masculine/feminine lines giving way to the romantic/military influences, which give way to the rococo/classical, which, in turn, lead to the historical/futuristic and so on and on. There are so many lines, they can be hard to follow; Bolton has a tendency to over-egg his theses, perhaps to justify fashion’s place in the museum. In the end, you can ignore them all, and enjoy the show purely as a visual feast.
The line conceit proves most useful in providing a template for the show’s designer, architect Tadao Ando (who was once commissioned to create a house for Lagerfeld that was never built). The space is composed of multiple galleries that undulate and curve around on themselves with little openings through which other galleries can be glimpsed — to allow peeks into the future or into the past. The effect is slightly disorienting in a good way, making it easy to lose oneself in the fields of Lagerfeldiana.
And what fields they are. Two little tweed Chanel lunching suits seem to vaporize into mist at the hems. An egg-shaped Fendi coat is composed of thousands of tiny brightly colored mink mosaic tiles, like a pointillist painting; another, strafed by overlapping shades made of layers of scrunched-up tulle that only look like fur. Lagerfeld could see possibilities in material that seemed otherwise inconceivable; he minted sequins out of concrete and out of wood.
There are Chloé dresses in Sonia Delaunay-esque prints and trompe l’oeil Grecian drapes. A Chanel frock coat is cut away not at the front but at the back, to expose frothing iridescent tiers. There are almost no logos in sight (a fun game is to guess which look goes with which brand; all three of his main employers were show sponsors), just as there is little of the kitschy play with brand iconography that helped make Chanel a part of pop culture — the double C boxing gloves, and bikinis — and that has been widely imitated at other brands. But there are cumulus clouds of feathers and blossoming rosettes made of lace and gleaming sequin armor that romp across centuries and salons.
Through it all, one shape appears again and again: the jacket pinched just a bit at the spine, so the shoulder blades roll up and back, raising the arm hole just so, with the line curving down over the waist. Bolton calls this the “Schlemmer shape,” after an Oskar Schlemmer painting, “Bauhaus Stairway” from 1932 (the period between the wars in Germany having been one of Lagerfeld’s gravitational poles).
Ditto the sketches that were Lagerfeld’s primary means of communication and are displayed with garments as their origin story. The designer would hand these drawings, which were conceived in the round (he thought not just from the front, but from the back) to the heads of his ateliers, to be “read” like their own private language. Just how that worked is enlivened by a group of absorbing videos created by documentary filmmaker Loïc Prigent that are interviews with those premieres d’atelier — the people who translated the designer’s sketches — about their work with Lagerfeld. They exude humanity, affection and pride.
As it happens, the videos are shown in the exhibition’s first gallery. You reach them after an entrance antechamber with another video, this one a close-up of Lagerfeld’s hands sketching a dress, along one wall; at the end of the room, like a punctuation mark, is a reconstruction of Lagerfeld’s Chanel desk, piled high with books and papers (each element chosen by Bolton to represent the breadth of Lagerfeld’s various obsessions, from Aubrey Beardsley to Diet Coke). Next to the desk is a pair of the designer’s black shoes, sitting empty on the floor. This opening video and desk mirror the exhibition’s close: another video of Lagerfeld’s hands, sketching — this time, not dresses, but himself. Kitty-corner to that visual is a set of vitrines displaying the designer’s signature accessories: the fingerless black leather gloves, black shades and fan that were the artifacts of the character he constructed for himself. Or “caricature,” as he called it.
Just before that, however, is a small ellipse of a room lined with 80 iPhones, plus one at the center, all loaded with the same video of Lagerfeld laughing, as well as some of his most famous quotes: “I have one instinct that is stronger than all others: the survival instinct”; “I always say what I think, and sometimes even what I don’t.” None of the bad ones, of course, although the latter statement seems particularly telling.
It’s a lost opportunity. Because by choosing to sandwich the clothes between representations of the man, the show actually suggests you can’t separate that man, in all his messy, uncomfortable reality, from the alchemy of his art — and you shouldn’t. That mess and discomfort are part of the mix; it’s part of the legacy, as it is for many of our most formative figures. If the Met can’t encourage that public conversation, what institution can?
Lagerfeld once said, in a quote that is inscribed over the entrance to the show, “Fashion does not belong in a museum.” This exhibition makes a glorious case that the clothes he made really do. But so, too, do the complications, and the tension.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The guest list for the first Monday in May, as the Met Gala is also known, serves as a Rorschach test for whom Anna Wintour deems important, circa now. This year's attendees included many of the frequent fliers, like Kim Kardashian, Gigi Hadid and Serena Williams, as well as some new names: the W.N.B.A. star and recent Russian detainee Brittney Griner, the musical artist Doja Cat and -- shockingly -- Paris Hilton. (How is it possible that she's never gone before? A grotesque oversight!)
Each year the dress code tracks to the theme of the show, which this time around is devoted to the six-and-a-half-decade career of Karl Lagerfeld. Many guests wore black and white or suits and gowns embellished with pearls or flowers -- favorite motifs of Mr. Lagerfeld. Bad Bunny went for a full white suit with a stole of fabric flowers that functioned as a train. Janelle Monáe gave a performance on the carpet, removing her enormous Thom Browne coat to reveal a sheer hoop skirt. Doja Cat and Jared Leto each paid homage to Choupette, Mr. Lagerfeld's feline friend. Kylie Jenner, Gabrielle Union, Salma Hayek Pinault and Pedro Pascal stood out in hot reds, and Lil Nas X stole the show in silver body paint and not much else.
There were many wonderful dresses that paid respect to Mr. Lagerfeld's legacy -- in fact, there were too many to name. There were also many looks that just looked great (Halle Bailey, Camila Morrone, Naomi Campbell, Keke Palmer and Aurora James just to name a few). So here's a reminder: The looks that follow did the most at the Met Gala -- not necessarily the best, not necessarily the worst, just the most. For the many more we don't cite here, be sure to look through our red carpet photos.
Michaela Coel: Most Embellished!
"Clutching of the pearls" was one of the driving ideas behind her heavily beaded look from Schiaparelli, Ms. Coel said. And, wow, were there plenty of pearls -- and stones, and crystals, and gold work -- to clutch!
Anok Yai: Most Cumulonimbus!
A rain cloud, but make it glittery. Ms. Yai's gold and silver strapless sequined dress by Prabal Gurung arched out dramatically at her hips, raining down in streams of silver to her feet.
Doja Cat: Most Fancy Feast!
Doja Cat leaned into both her name and the theme, dressing in a homage to Karl Lagerfeld's famed white cat, Choupette. She wore a backless hooded silver gown from Oscar de la Renta with a white feather train. The best part of the look, though, was plastered to her face: custom feline prosthetics.
Bad Bunny: Most Flowers (We Didn't Actually Count)!
Don't step on Bad Bunny's train, but do get on board with it. The musician's white suit from Simon Porte Jacquemus was giving business in the front, party in the back. Or backless, as it were, as the jacket had a large cutout.
Dua Lipa: Most Upholstered!
Like many, the evening's co-chair opted to go straight to the source, wearing a white tweed Chanel gown styled after one model Claudia Schiffer donned in 1992. (Check the pockets!) Bonus points to Ms. Lipa for styling it with some subtle, understated jewelry, a Tiffany diamond necklace weighing in at just 100 carats.
Phoebe Bridgers: Most Skeletal (in a Good Way)!
Fans will have immediately spotted the link between Ms. Bridgers's signature skeleton suit and her Met gown from Tory Burch. On Monday, the musician traded up her usual bones for, fittingly, a black dress studded with strategically positioned pearls.
Taika Waititi: Most Pearlicious!
On a night with no shortage of pearls, Mr. Waititi's strands -- only two slung from his neck and dangling all the way to just below his hips -- fell over a long pearlescent gray tuxedo jacket by Prabal Gurung.
Gisele Bündchen: Most Tom Brady Who?!
Her white Chanel gown was elongated by sparkly columns of paneling, but the most notable part of her ensemble was a white-feathered cape that she flapped for extra drama. Reminiscent of an angel, one might say.
Brian Tyree Henry: Most Royal!
Mr. Henry's look for the evening had other lovely elements -- pearls among them, of course -- but the most important of them was his cape, piled high with artfully structured black ruffles.
Pedro Pascal: Most Internet Daddy!
There are plenty of things one could write about Mr. Pascal's red and black color-blocked pairing on Monday night, but let's be honest, we're all just thinking about the shorts.
Lil Nas X: Most Statuesque!
The musician's entire body -- save for a thong -- was covered in silver paint and rhinestones, like a high fashion Tin Man via Pat McGrath. Someone please snap a photo of his seat after dinner.
Rihanna: Most Wait and See!
Arriving at 10:15 p.m. as only she could and get away with, Rihanna stepped onto the carpet looking rather, well, elliptical tucked inside a cream-colored egg of camellias from Valentino. How was she feeling? "Expensive," she said.
Jared Leto: Most Furry!
Mr. Leto assumed the role of mascot in a giant white cat costume, another nod to Mr. Lagerfeld's beloved pet. After he had sufficiently scared the press corps, he removed the costume, revealing pale blue eye shadow that matched the cat's oversized eyes.
Janelle Monáe: Most True to Form!
What started out as an oversized tweed overcoat ended as a black, sparkly bikini as Ms. Monáe revealed layer after layer -- including a giant hoop skirt -- of Thom Browne. (Which might have taken the prize for least clothes on the carpet were Lil Nas X not in attendance.)
Billie Eilish: Most Bewitching!
The musician's sheer black corset dress from Simone Rocha matched her hair, which was flanked by sparkly black barrettes on either side of her face. A departure from last year's blond bombshell look.
David Byrne: Best Accessory!
The Talking Heads frontman didn't need to worry about his bicycle making it up the steps. Someone came to take it away before he ascended.
The Cockroach: Most 15 Seconds of Fame!
An uninvited guest scurried up the carpet while the crowd waited for Rihanna to make her entrance. "Who are you wearing" jokes were bandied about.

Should Uninsured Deposits Get a Warning Label?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the wake of bank collapses, some have called for the F.D.I.C. to guarantee all deposits. But there may be a more strategic solution.
How do we avoid the next run on a bank?
If there has been a lesson in the recent spate of bank failures, it is that deposit flight can now happen quickly. It no longer requires a teller to hand money to customers waiting in long lines around the block. Tens of billions of dollars can vanish in hours or minutes.
That's why guaranteeing deposits has become so crucial. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation explicitly insures the first $ 250,000 in any account, but nothing over that. The Biden administration has so far implicitly guaranteed all deposits by invoking a "systemic risk exception" -- but such an implicit guarantee has not been genuinely tested against a run on multiple banks at the same time.
There are fair arguments for the F.D.I.C. to guarantee all deposits, but there may be a more strategic, surgical and free-market solution.
Consider this: What if the banking system coalesced around a separate insurance program -- we'll call it F.D.I.C.+ -- for deposits above $ 250,000?
Banks could decide whether to use the insurance program. If they did, they could market and advertise that all deposits were insured. If they decided not to, the Federal Reserve could require them to have higher capital requirements and other restrictions to mitigate the possibility of a run.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could then require banks to use the equivalent of the warning label on cigarettes to show which accounts were not insured. This warning would appear on customer apps and statements, making it clear to customers when their money was not insured and they would not be rescued.
Such restrictions would be a strong incentive for banks to participate in the F.D.I.C.+ program. Because banks would pay to insure their large deposits, the program would also provide an incentive for better business models.
Silicon Valley Bank, which failed last month, catered to the wealthy. The same is true of First Republic Bank, whose stock price dropped more than 43 percent on Friday as its fate remained uncertain. Bloomberg reported on Saturday that the F.D.I.C. has asked JPMorgan Chase and PNC to submit final bids for the ailing lender this weekend in an effort to broker an orderly sale.
Silicon Valley Bank offered tech executives good deals on mortgages and more. Many of these executives, in turn, encouraged the companies they invested in to park their money in the banks. First Republic had a similar business tactic: It distinguished itself by offering wealthy clients jumbo mortgages, and offering spectacular white glove customer service.
That meant the banks had a huge number of deposits larger than $ 250,000, which are not backed by the government's deposit insurance fund. Nearly 90 percent of SVB's roughly $ 88 billion was uninsured. And about two-thirds of First Re­pub­lic's de­posits were unin­sured at the end of last year.
That left the banks vulnerable to flights. Not only did they have large amounts of uninsured deposits, which businesses also commonly hold in their accounts, they also had a high number of clients with strong networks who were able to sense trouble and flee more quickly than a business may have. The bank run at SVB "appears to have been fueled by social media and SVB's concentrated network of venture capital investors and technology firms," concluded a report released by the Federal Reserve.
Maybe F.D.I.C.+ would have prevented it. -- Andrew Sorkin and Lauren Hirsch
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Fox News ousted Tucker Carlson. The Fox Corporation board made the decision after discovering offensive private messages from Carlson that had been redacted in legal filings for Dominion Voting Systems' defamation case against Fox. After Carlson's firing, Russian state media reportedly offered him a job, and viewership of the conservative news channel Newsmax boomed. CNN also fired an anchor this week: Don Lemon, who made remarks in February about women and aging that were widely perceived to be sexist.
British regulators blocked Microsoft's $ 69 billion Activision deal. The surprising decision reinforced the increasing assertiveness of global antitrust regulators. Microsoft's deadline to close the acquisition is July 18. If its appeal fails, it will most likely have to walk away and pay a $ 3 billion breakup fee to Activision.
Price check. The latest economic indicators showed that inflation is slowing, but stubborn, as Federal Reserve officials prepare to make an interest rate decision next week. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation climbed 4.2 percent over the year through March, down from 5.1 percent in February, while wages in March climbed 5.1 percent from a year earlier and were up 1.2 percent from December. Data released Thursday showed that gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, increased at an annual rate of just 1.1 percent in the first quarter.
Bed, Bath & Bankruptcy. The home goods store Bed Bath & Beyond began the process of closing its 360 stores and 120 Buy Buy Baby locations after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sunday. Customers had until Wednesday to use their coupons.
It's not just tech companies talking about A.I.
The release of ChatGPT in November seems to have gotten companies talking about artificial intelligence. Mentions of "A.I." or "artificial intelligence" on corporate calls, which have been rising over the last decade, increased 50 percent from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this one. That's according to the market intelligence platform AlphaSense, which tracks data from more than 9,000 public companies that host calls in English.
Of the 2,007 companies that have hosted corporate calls since April 1, 334 mentioned the technology. And it's not just tech companies.
Roger S. Penske, the chief executive of the transportation service company Penske, said the company was using artificial intelligence to answer basic customer inquiries and make sales appointments. "We're scheduling better. We're more efficient, and it's enabling us to use different periods of time with our scheduling to be better with our tech," he told investors.
James Quincey, the chief executive of Coca-Cola, told investors that "one doesn't have to think very far to think of all the design work that goes into some of our point-of-sale material and how that can be driven through A.I. into the future."
Arthur Sadoun, the chief executive of Publicis Groupe, the public relations and advertising conglomerate, sees A.I. speeding up the creative process, but said he thought that any loss of revenue to quicker work "will be largely compensated by the necessities to multiply the number of creative assets due to personalization at scale."
When an anchor gets fired, this lawyer gets hired
Tucker Carlson and Don Lemon, the TV news anchors who made big news themselves this week when they were fired and taken off the air, have hired the same lawyer: Bryan Freedman. Though neither host has announced a lawsuit against his former employer, the hiring of Freedman could be a sign of legal battles to come.
The prominent Hollywood lawyer has a reputation for being an aggressive courtroom combatant. He founded his Los Angeles firm, Freedman + Taitelman, with Michael Taitelman in 1997. In its list of "power lawyers," The Hollywood Reporter described Freedman as "an expert in crisis litigation, the type that's heavy in late night phone calls and corporate drama."
One of his specialties: securing big payouts for TV stars facing controversy. His clients include Chris Cuomo, the former CNN anchor, who was ousted after evidence emerged that he had advised his brother, Andrew Cuomo, during a sexual harassment scandal (he is seeking $ 125 million for wrongful termination); Megyn Kelly, who secured a full payout of her contract when she left NBC after wondering on the air whether dressing up in blackface for Halloween was inappropriate; Mike Richards, a former host and executive producer of "Jeopardy!," who left after a report revealed offensive comments he had made on a podcast several years earlier; and Chris Harrison of "The Bachelor," who stepped down after making remarks he later acknowledged were dismissive of racism.
Freedman has also represented Quentin Tarantino, Julia Roberts, Mariah Carey, Seth Rogen and Gabrielle Union.
On our radar: Giannis Antetokounmpo on 'failure'
After the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks suffered a season-ending loss in the N.B.A. playoffs on Wednesday, a reporter asked Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks' star player, if he considered the season "a failure." Antetokounmpo's passionate response has since been passed around for its wisdom about moving forward from a loss: "Do you get a promotion every year, in your job?" he asked. "No, right? So every year you work is a failure -- yes or no? No. Every year you work, you work towards something, towards a goal, which is to get a promotion, to be able to take care of your family, provide a house for them, or take care of your parents. You work towards a goal -- it's not a failure. It's steps to success."
Thanks for reading! We'll see you on Monday.

Cutting Back as Food Costs Go Up, Up, Up: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some of the biggest packaged food companies raised their prices last quarter and their profits rose, but some customers were starting to cut back or trade down.
Brenetta Smith used to buy brand-name foods like Oreos and Doritos without thinking twice. But when she noticed that food prices at her local supermarket, Aldi, were soaring, she realized she had to do something different: "I have to change the way I shop," she said.
So Ms. Smith, 40, a stay-at-home parent in Memphis, started stocking up on dry goods like rice and flour, freezing meat that she bought on sale and avoiding packaged foods, which meant no more Oreos and Doritos. "We've cut out all of the snacks," she said.
Now that she has developed new habits and found that her approach helps stretch her husband's salary as a cable technician, she doesn't plan to go back to her old ways.
"Even when the world returns to normal, you can still maximize your paycheck and your income," Ms. Smith said. She started posting budget tips on TikTok in December, and she quickly amassed a following.
Americans have faced substantial inflation at grocery stores and restaurants. Over the past year, overall food prices were up 8.5 percent as consumers paid more for staples like eggs, fruit and meat.
And corporations that wrested back pricing power during the pandemic may be reluctant to give it up. In earnings reports over the past week, some of the biggest packaged food companies said they raised their prices last quarter and saw their profits go up.
But there have been signs that consumers are starting to resist price increases by cutting back or trading down to lower-priced options. Some of the same multinational companies that raised prices on food said the volume they sold went down.
Brands risk alienating consumers with these high prices, said Sucharita Kodali, a retail analyst at Forrester. "Customers may or may not come back," she said. "At some point, they will say enough is enough."
For now, many major companies are raising prices enough that gains are offsetting drops in sales volume. PepsiCo, which makes products like Quaker Oats and Cheetos, said on Tuesday that it increased prices 16 percent in the latest quarter, helping its profit grow 18 percent (excluding its sale of a juice company last year), even as volume fell 2 percent.
Nestlé, whose portfolio includes Hot Pockets and Perrier water, said on Tuesday that it increased its prices 9.8 percent in the last quarter but that volume fell half a percent -- an improvement from the prior quarter, when volume dropped 2.6 percent.
And on Thursday, Unilever, the consumer goods giant that makes about a third of its revenue from food brands, announced that it had raised prices 13.4 percent on items like Hellmann's mayonnaise, and that volume fell 1.3 percent.
So far, "what we are seeing is the willingness to pay up for things you need," said Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets, adding that items like milk and perishable groceries must be replenished often.
But consumers may start reallocating their spending. "For companies that are able to maintain price elevation, they're going to see their profits go higher," he added.
Coca-Cola, for example, raised prices last quarter, and its profit jumped 12 percent, to $ 3.1 billion.
In general, consumers are continuing to spend. The U.S. economy grew at a 1.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday, the third consecutive quarter of growth after output went down in the first half of last year.
And food inflation has been abating. In March, food prices were flat compared with the month before, according to the Consumer Price Index, and prices for food at home fell 0.3 percent. But prices at restaurants continued to go up, rising 0.6 percent from February.
Still, some customers are changing their buying habits. Kylie Park, 31, used to buy three or four boxes of Pop-Tarts Bites for her son on trips to her local Safeway in Oahu, Hawaii. But the treats have become more expensive, so she often buys just one package at a time. She also stopped buying as much juice, she said, and has been skipping her trips to Costco for bulk goods.
"Before, I would overbuy; I realized I don't need all of that," said Ms. Park, who works as a part-time aesthetician and content creator. "I don't think I would go back."
She added that she had mostly just paid the higher prices on staples, allocating more of her budget to groceries. "Everything I buy is normally everything we eat," she said.
Other consumers are opting to buy cheaper generic products. When companies raise prices too much, consumers seek alternatives, Ms. Kodali said. "You basically introduced a bunch of people who were your audience to your competitors," she said. "What you end up seeing is a trade-off."
Dianna Anderson's attitude toward cereal brands used to be: "If I can't get the name brand, I won't get it." But when inflation started eroding their breakfast budget, Mx. Anderson, 37, who uses they/them pronouns, started buying generic cereal at Target.
"I would probably stick with the Target brand," said Mx. Anderson, a writer who works at a nonprofit organization in Minneapolis. "It's a decent product, and it's cheaper."
Fast food restaurants have likewise seen profits rise as they raise prices.
McDonald's announced this week that it had "strategic menu price increases" in the recent quarter. Same-store sales were up 12.6 percent, and its profit rose 63 percent from a year earlier, to $ 1.8 billion. But the company acknowledged that some customers were cutting back.
"I'm really proud of how our system has executed pricing in light of the double-digit inflation that we have been experiencing," Christopher J. Kempczinski, chief executive of McDonald's, said on a call with analysts.
He added that the number of items per order was decreasing slightly -- some customers were opting not to add fries. "We are seeing, in some places, resistance to pricing, more resistance than we saw at the outset," he said.
Ms. Park is among those resisting. She used to go to McDonald's, her favorite fast food spot, during her lunch break every week, she said. But when she noticed last summer that prices were climbing and portions appeared small, she cut back to once a month.
"Filet-O-Fish is my favorite ever," Ms. Park said. "It feels like we're losing out."
At Chipotle, which has been raising prices for more than a year, average menu prices were up 10 percent last quarter from the previous year, and profit was 84 percent higher. The company also expanded its profit margin, and sales were up.
"I think we've now demonstrated we do have pricing power," Brian Niccol, the chief executive of Chipotle, said on a call with analysts this week. "We have a really strong brand, and we don't want to be in front of the inflationary environment, but we also don't want to fall behind."
Not everyone is happy with the higher costs at Chipotle.
Amy Scalf, 37, was shocked to find that her burrito bowl with guacamole cost more than $ 11 at a Chipotle near her home in Lexington, Ky. Ms. Scalf, who offers saving tips on social media, said she might start going to Taco Bell instead.
"It's definitely a deterrent," she said of the higher prices. "It's an incentive to go and get an option that's cheaper."

Brenetta Smith used to buy brand-name foods like Oreos and Doritos without thinking twice. But when she noticed that food prices at her local supermarket, Aldi, were soaring, she realized she had to do something different: “I have to change the way I shop,” she said.
So Smith, 40, a stay-at-home parent in Memphis, Tennessee, started stocking up on dry goods like rice and flour, freezing meat that she bought on sale and avoiding packaged foods, which meant no more Oreos and Doritos. “We’ve cut out all of the snacks,” she said.
Now that she has developed new habits and found that her approach helps stretch her husband’s salary as a cable technician, she doesn’t plan to go back to her old ways.
“Even when the world returns to normal, you can still maximize your paycheck and your income,” Smith said. She started posting budget tips on TikTok in December, and she quickly amassed a following.
Americans have faced substantial inflation at grocery stores and restaurants. Over the past year, overall food prices were up 8.5% as consumers paid more for staples like eggs, fruit and meat.
And corporations that wrested back pricing power during the pandemic may be reluctant to give it up. In earnings reports over the past week, some of the biggest packaged food companies said they raised their prices last quarter and saw their profits go up.
But there have been signs that consumers are starting to resist price increases by cutting back or trading down to lower-priced options. Some of the same multinational companies that raised prices on food said the volume they sold went down.
Brands risk alienating consumers with these high prices, said Sucharita Kodali, a retail analyst at Forrester. “Customers may or may not come back,” she said. “At some point, they will say enough is enough.”
For now, many major companies are raising prices enough that gains are offsetting drops in sales volume. PepsiCo, which makes products like Quaker Oats and Cheetos, said on Tuesday that it increased prices 16% in the latest quarter, helping its profit grow 18% (excluding its sale of a juice company last year), even as volume fell 2%.
Nestlé, whose portfolio includes Hot Pockets and Perrier water, said on Tuesday that it increased its prices 9.8% in the last quarter but that volume fell half a percent — an improvement from the prior quarter, when volume dropped 2.6%.
And on Thursday, Unilever, the consumer goods giant that makes about a third of its revenue from food brands, announced that it had raised prices 13.4% on items such as Hellmann’s mayonnaise, and that volume fell 1.3%.
So far, “what we are seeing is the willingness to pay up for things you need,” said Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets, adding that items like milk and perishable groceries must be replenished often.
But consumers may start reallocating their spending. “For companies that are able to maintain price elevation, they’re going to see their profits go higher,” he added.
Coca-Cola, for example, raised prices last quarter, and its profit jumped 12%, to $3.1 billion.
In general, consumers are continuing to spend. The U.S. economy grew at a 1.1% annual rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday, the third consecutive quarter of growth after output went down in the first half of last year.
And food inflation has been abating. In March, food prices were flat compared with the month before, according to the Consumer Price Index, and prices for food at home fell 0.3%. But prices at restaurants continued to go up, rising 0.6% from February.
Still, some customers are changing their buying habits. Kylie Park, 31, used to buy three or four boxes of Pop-Tarts Bites for her son on trips to her local Safeway in Oahu, Hawaii. But the treats have become more expensive, so she often buys just one package at a time. She also stopped buying as much juice, she said, and has been skipping her trips to Costco for bulk goods.
“Before, I would overbuy; I realized I don’t need all of that,” said Park, who works as a part-time aesthetician and content creator. “I don’t think I would go back.”
She added that she had mostly just paid the higher prices on staples, allocating more of her budget to groceries. “Everything I buy is normally everything we eat,” she said.
Other consumers are opting to buy cheaper generic products. When companies raise prices too much, consumers seek alternatives, Kodali said. “You basically introduced a bunch of people who were your audience to your competitors,” she said. “What you end up seeing is a trade-off.”
Dianna Anderson’s attitude toward cereal brands used to be: “If I can’t get the name brand, I won’t get it.” But when inflation started eroding their breakfast budget, Anderson, 37, who uses they/them pronouns, started buying generic cereal at Target.
“I would probably stick with the Target brand,” said Anderson, a writer who works at a nonprofit organization in Minneapolis. “It’s a decent product, and it’s cheaper.”
Fast food restaurants have likewise seen profits rise as they raise prices.
McDonald’s announced last week that it had “strategic menu price increases” in the recent quarter. Same-store sales were up 12.6%, and its profit rose 63% from a year earlier, to $1.8 billion. But the company acknowledged that some customers were cutting back.
“I’m really proud of how our system has executed pricing in light of the double-digit inflation that we have been experiencing,” Christopher J. Kempczinski, chief executive of McDonald’s, said on a call with analysts.
He added that the number of items per order was decreasing slightly — some customers were opting not to add fries. “We are seeing, in some places, resistance to pricing, more resistance than we saw at the outset,” he said.
Park is among those resisting. She used to go to McDonald’s, her favorite fast food spot, during her lunch break every week, she said. But when she noticed last summer that prices were climbing and portions appeared small, she cut back to once a month.
“Filet-O-Fish is my favorite ever,” Park said. “It feels like we’re losing out.”
At Chipotle, which has been raising prices for more than a year, average menu prices were up 10% last quarter from the previous year, and profit was 84% higher. The company also expanded its profit margin, and sales were up.

Do Addicts Have Free Will?: [Op-Ed]

Full text: When I was arrested and charged with possession with intent to sell cocaine in 1986, I was addicted to both coke and heroin. Although I was facing a 15 years-to-life sentence, the first thing I did after my parents bailed me out and held a family meeting was to find and secretly inject some prescription opioids that I knew the police hadn't confiscated.
I knew that doing this further jeopardized my life prospects and my relationships with everyone I cared about. I knew it made no sense. But I didn't believe that I could cope in any other way. Until I finally recognized that I needed treatment and began recovery in 1988 -- with the prospect of that lengthy sentence under New York's draconian Rockefeller laws still occluding my future -- I didn't think I had any real choice.
Was my brain hijacked by drugs -- or was I willfully choosing to risk it all for a few hours of selfish pleasure? What makes people continue taking drugs like street fentanyl, which put them at daily risk of death?
These questions are at the heart of drug policy and the way we view and treat addiction. But simplistic answers have stymied efforts to ameliorate drug use disorders and reduce stigma.
Research now shows that addiction doesn't ‌‌mean either being completely subject to irresistible impulses, or making totally free choices. Addiction's effects on decision-making are complex. Understanding them can help policymakers, treatment providers and family members aid recovery.
Claims that people with addiction are unable to control themselves are belied by basic facts. Few of us inject drugs in front of the police, which means that most are capable of delaying use. ‌‌Addicted people often make complicated plans over days and months to obtain drugs and hide use from others, again indicating purposeful activity. Those given the option will use clean needles. Moreover, small rewards for drug-free urine tests -- used in a treatment called contingency management -- are quite successful at helping people quit, which couldn't be possible if addiction obliterated choice.
However, those who contend that substance use disorder is just a series of self-centered decisions face conflicting evidence, too. The most obvious ‌is the persistence of addiction despite dire losses like being cut off by family members or friends, getting fired, becoming homeless, contracting infectious diseases or being repeatedly ‌incarcerated‌‌.
‌Most people who try drugs don't get addicted, even to opioids or methamphetamine, which suggests that ‌factors other than simply being exposed to a drug can contribute to addiction. ‌The majority of people who do get hooked have other psychiatric disorders, traumatic childhoods or both -- only ‌7 percent report no history of mental illness. ‌‌Nearly 75 percent of women with heroin addiction‌‌ were sexually abused as children -- and most people with any type of addiction have suffered at least one and often many forms of childhood trauma‌‌. ‌‌This data implies that ‌‌genetic and environmental vulnerabilities influence risk.
So how does addiction affect choice? Neuroscientists and philosophers are beginning to converge on answers, which could help make policy more humane and more effective.
Brains can be seen as prediction engines, constantly calculating what is most likely to happen next and whether it will be beneficial or harmful. As children grow up, their emotions and desires get calibrated to guide them toward‌ what their brains predict will ‌meet their social and physical needs. Ideally, as we develop, we gain more control and optimize the ability to choose.
‌But there are many ways that these varied processes can ‌go awry in addiction and alter how a person makes choices and responds to consequences.
Traditionally, researchers focused on how the drug experience changes during addiction. At first, using is fun, perhaps exciting, perhaps soothing. It solves a problem like social anxiety or an absence of pleasure. Then, however, it becomes less effective: More is needed to get the desired effects, and coping without it begins to seem impossible. As addiction becomes ingrained, the craving for drugs intensifies even as they become less enjoyable.‌
In my own experience with cocaine, this disconnect was pronounced. At first, I found it euphoric. Toward‌ the end of my addiction, I was injecting dozens of times a day, desperately wanting coke but ‌also knowing it would make me feel hideous. The ‌‌incentive salience‌ theory suggests that addiction is a problem of outsized "wanting" despite reduced "liking," which becomes less amenable to cognitive control over time.
‌‌During addiction, people also tend to prioritize short-term rewards over long-term gains, which means that they postpone the pain associated with quitting, often indefinitely. This idea, which is known as "delay discounting" further helps explain why people with chaotic childhoods and precarious incomes are at higher risk: When a better future seems unlikely, it is rational to get whatever joy you can in the present.
Chandra Sripada, professor of psychiatry and philosophy at the University of Michigan, argues that distorted thinking is more important in addictive behavior than overwhelming desire, leading to what he calls "unreliable" control over use. He focuses on how addiction affects our stream of consciousness.
During addiction, he contends, despairing thoughts about oneself and the future -- not just thoughts about how good the drug is -- predominate. At the same time, thoughts about negative consequences of use are minimized, as are those about alternative ways of coping. Drugs are overvalued as a way to mitigate distress; everything else is undervalued. The result is an unstable balance, which, more often than not, tips toward getting high.
This theory ‌is helpful for explaining who is most likely to get addicted and what is most likely to generate recovery. Risk factors like poverty, a traumatic childhood and mental illness generate excess stress while tending to produce negative thoughts about oneself. In my case, I was depressed and isolated because of what I later learned was undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder -- and hated myself for my inability to connect. The result was a mental climate conducive to relying on drugs, even when they no longer ‌provided relief.
Factors linked to recovery -- like social support and employment -- can offset distorted thoughts and inflated valuation of drug use. Essentially, people make better choices when they recognize and have access to better options‌. If you are locked in a room with an escape route unknown to you hidden under the carpet, you are just as trapped as if that exit didn't exist. My recovery began when I saw that there was a bearable way out.
This is why punitive approaches so often backfire: Causing more pain for people who view drugs as their only way to cope drives desire to use even more. Punishment doesn't teach new skills that can allow better decisions. I was just lucky that I got help before it was too late.
But if addicted people are making choices that are harmful to themselves or others, shouldn't they be held responsible for their behavior? Hanna Pickard, distinguished professor of philosophy and bioethics at Johns Hopkins University, calls for a framework she labels "responsibility without blame." In this view, addicted people do have some control over their decisions. However, that doesn't mean they deserve blame or that shaming and punishing them will improve matters.
Instead, providing people with both the skills and the resources they need to change, and compassionately holding them accountable as they learn to make different choices, can promote recovery. (This approach is a therapeutic one, not aimed at adjudicating addiction-related crimes, although the idea could potentially be extended into the legal realm.)
Research finds that framing addictive behavior as an involuntary brain disease reduces the tendency to blame people for it. But this perspective does not necessarily alleviate stigma or the desire to punish. This is probably because viewing individuals as having no autonomy dehumanizes them and makes others want to lock them up in an attempt to protect society.
The "responsibility without blame" concept offers a way around this: ‌People with addiction have agency, but it is compromised. And this is not unique to addiction.
"I will have less control, if I'm exhausted and tired and upset, than if I'm well-slept in a stable happy place in my life," said Professor Pickard, noting that being "hangry" is a classic example of ‌diminishe‌‌d emotional control.
To recover, people with addiction need both new skills and an environment that provides better alternatives. This doesn't mean rewarding people for bad behavior. Instead, we must recognize that compulsive drug use is far more often a response to a life where meaning and comfort appear out of reach than it is a selfish quest for excess pleasure.

Fashion Remade With Irreverence: [Style Desk]

Full text: How best to understand the designer whose 64-year career is the basis for the 2023 Met Gala and Costume Institute exhibition? Just look at the clothes.
Through talent, longevity and sheer productivity, it is possible that Karl Lagerfeld did more than any other designer to shape the look of the latter 20th century and the early 21st century. Across more than six decades, five different brands (three at the same time) and numerous collaborations, he flooded the zone from Paris to Dallas to Shanghai, dressing Hollywood, the haute and the high street.
But why tell when we can show? Here are some of the most notable looks from nearly every stage of an extraordinary career.
Jean Patou
In 1954, Mr. Lagerfeld, a young German with no formal fashion training, won the coat category in the prestigious Woolmark Prize -- a serendipitous event that led to a job as an assistant to the couturier Pierre Balmain, who was one of the judges. After only three years in that atelier, while still in his 20s, Mr. Lagerfeld was named artistic director of Jean Patou, a brand founded in 1914, whose founder was known for liberating the female form and for creating the perfume Joy.
There, Mr. Lagerfeld went on to create 10 couture collections over five years, laying the groundwork for his own facility in working with petites mains, and his ability to romp gleefully within the confines of an established aesthetic.
Chloé
In 1966, Mr. Lagerfeld became designer of Chloé, one of the earliest ready-to-wear brands in Paris, working first with its founder, Gaby Aghion (who initially brought him on as a freelancer in 1964), before becoming sole designer in 1974. He would remain at the brand until 1983, returning again from 1992 to 1997.
Mr. Lagerfeld's early work at Chloé, a name that became synonymous with a certain wafty femininity, may surprise many, toying as it did with prints and Surrealism. But it also reflected his ability to balance luxe eccentricity and wearability, with an eye to commerce (he never saw "sales" as a dirty word). By his second stint, he had fully embraced the bohemian, and set the tone for what was to come.
Fendi
In 1965, the five Fendi sisters, who had inherited their family fur business from their parents, Adele and Edoardo, brought Mr. Lagerfeld on to design their ready-to-wear and fur collections.
They may have thought they were getting a clever designer, but what they actually got was a lifetime partnership. Silvia Venturini Fendi, the daughter of Anna Fendi, who grew up to design Fendi bags and men's wear alongside Mr. Lagerfeld, recalled that even as a child, "when Karl came," it was clear "something special was going on and I should pay attention."
Mr. Lagerfeld created the "FF" logo, which stood for the concept of "fun fur" (as well as Fendi), and then started shaving, dyeing, sculpting and otherwise transforming the material, as well as introducing such pelts as mole, rabbit and squirrel to high fashion.
His work on the runway was equally experimental, with a wide array of references, including Fendi's Roman roots and futurism. When LVMH bought the brand in 1999, Mr. Lagerfeld went with it, eventually pioneering a "haute fourrure" line (who had even heard of that before?) to go with the ready-to-wear, remaining defiantly pro-fur even as the public mood shifted and other brands turned against the idea of wearing animal skins.
Chanel
In 1982, Mr. Lagerfeld got the job that would vault him into the fashion stratosphere: artistic director of Chanel, at that point a brand known primarily for perfume and bourgeois handbags. By adopting an approach he summed up in highly questionable terms ("Chanel is an institution, and you have to treat an institution like a whore -- and then you get something out of her"), he revived a moribund brand, providing a template for the industry that is still in place today.
Splicing classic Chanel iconography -- the camellia, pearls, the Maltese cross, bouclé suiting -- with a heavy dose of irony and irreverence, he managed to make the brand a pop culture phenomenon, a symbol of classicism and a financial juggernaut. He helped create and popularize the traveling fashion show, bringing his runway to Salzburg, Edinburgh, Shanghai and Havana; dreamed up such viral runway sets as an iceberg (sculpted from parts of a Swedish glacier), a supermarket and a rocket ship (that actually lifted off); made mini-movies with Nicole Kidman and Kristen Stewart; and ultimately helped bring the brand annual sales topping $ 11 billion.
Karl Lagerfeld
Perhaps tired of working within the style vernaculars established by others, in 1984, Mr. Lagerfeld founded his own namesake line. While it would never reach the size or fame of Chanel or Fendi, and though it went through numerous ownership changes, Lagerfeld the brand reflected his personal style more closely than any of his other brands. Imagine rock 'n' roll tailoring with a Teutonic edge, filtered through a monochromatic lens, and you'll get the idea.
H&M
In 2004, Mr. Lagerfeld became the first couture designer to collaborate with a mass-market brand when he signed on to do an H&M collection. First the fashion world was shocked, then it was intrigued, and after the line of Karl-alike black suits, portrait tees and L.B.D.s sold out in seconds, a whole new genre and approach was born.

Full text: The elimination of check marks that helped authenticate accounts has convulsed a platform that once seemed indispensable for following breaking news.
In the 24 hours after Twitter last week eliminated the blue check mark that historically served as a means of identifying public agencies, at least 11 new accounts began impersonating the Los Angeles Police Department.
More than 20 purported to be various agencies of the federal government. Someone pretending to be the mayor of New York City promised to create a Department of Traffic and Parking Enforcement and slash police funding by 70 percent.
Mr. Musk's decision to stop giving check marks to people and groups verified to be who they said were, and instead offering them to anyone who paid for one, is the latest tumult at Twitter, the social media giant he has vowed to remake since he acquired it last year for $ 44 billion.
The changes have convulsed a platform that once seemed indispensable for following news as it broke around the world. The information on Twitter is now increasingly unreliable. Accounts that impersonate public officials, government agencies and celebrities have proliferated. So have propaganda and disinformation that threaten to further erode trust in public institutions. The consequences are only beginning to emerge.
Alyssa Kann, a research associate at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, said Twitter under Mr. Musk was systematically dismantling safeguards that had been put in place over years of consideration and controversy.
"When there are so many things going wrong at once, it's like: Which fire do you put out first?" she said.
After a public dispute with NPR, which Twitter falsely labeled state-affiliated media, the platform last week removed all labels that had identified state-owned media, including those controlled by authoritarian states like Russia, China and Iran.
That, coupled with a decision to stop blocking recommendations for them, has coincided with a spike in engagement for many of these accounts, according to research by the Digital Forensic Research Lab and another organization that studies disinformation, Reset, which is based in London.
In Sudan, new accounts on Twitter are falsely representing both sides of the civil war that has erupted there. One account that, presumably, bought a blue check mark falsely proclaimed the death of Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, the leader of the rebel Rapid Support Forces. More than 1.7 million people viewed the tweet.
Twitter's new head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin, did not respond to a request for comment on the changes and their consequences.
Twitter has always been a font of misinformation and worse, but the previous policies sought to inform readers of the sources of content and limit the most egregious instances. The debut of verified accounts at Twitter in 2009 is usually associated with Tony La Russa, a major-league baseball manager who sued Twitter for trademark infringement and other claims after being impersonated on the platform.
Over time, verified accounts with blue check marks steered users to official sources and real people. Labeling news organizations as state media indicated that the accounts reflected a certain point of view.
Impersonators became a problem almost immediately after Mr. Musk took the helm in November and offered to sell the check marks to anyone who subscribed for the monthly fee. He backtracked after companies like Eli Lilly and PepsiCo grappled with seemingly verified spoof accounts promising free insulin and praising the superiority of Coca-Cola.
By last week, Twitter had begun removing the blue check marks from companies, government agencies, news organizations and others who did not agree to pay. It appears that many chose not to sign up, though Twitter has not disclosed any figures.
Some cheered the changes.
"Now you can even find me in the search," tweeted Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of RT, the Russian state television network that has been accused of rampant misinformation and hate speech aimed at Ukraine. She signed off the tweet by saying, "Brotherly, Elon @elonmusk, from the heart."
Twitter's algorithms previously excluded accounts labeled state officials or media from recommendations, dampening engagement. According to Reset, 124 accounts belonging to Russian state media have received on average 33 percent more exposure in views and impressions after the changes, which took effect in late March.
They include accounts like that of Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president of Russia and deputy chairman of the country's security council, who posted a distorted photograph of President Biden on Tuesday, calling him in English "a daring geezer."
When an account argued this month that Twitter was amplifying Russia's genocidal propaganda toward Ukraine, Mr. Musk replied dismissively: "All news is to some degree propaganda. Let people decide for themselves." (The account he was responding to has since been suspended.)
Researchers said the abrupt changes in how the check marks are obtained threatened, at a minimum, to create confusion. They could also undermine trust in a tool for communication during crises like natural disasters.
The main account of the Los Angeles Police Department has a gray check mark, which Twitter created for "legacy accounts," but not all of its various bureaus do -- the Hollywood division, for example. In addition to providing blue check marks for $ 8 a month, Twitter has invited organizations to pay $ 1,000 to receive gold marks for multiple accounts. For a time, at least, one was extended to a Disney Junior impostor account that tweeted racist and vulgar language.
"This is going to be chaos for emergency services," tweeted Marc-André Argentino, a research fellow at the London-based International Center for the Study of Radicalization.
Mr. Argentino tracked examples showing an account impersonating the mayor of Chicago replying to one impersonating the city's Department of Transportation. Another had New York City's actual government-run account arguing with an impostor.
"Yes this is funny, let us all laugh," Mr. Argentino wrote. "Now take two seconds and go back to any mass casualty incident in a major city, or a natural disaster, or any crisis/critical incident when people turn to official sources of information in times need & think of the harm that this can cause."
On Friday, the comedian George Carlin's daughter, Kelly Carlin, tweeted an accusation that someone was masquerading as the account she runs for her late father, even using the same profile photo and claiming to be her.
"HERE IT BEGINS," she wrote, later complaining after several unsuccessful attempts to have the impostor account removed that "Twitter is broken." The spoof account was still up on Wednesday, with nine followers.
Josh Boerman, who co-hosts a pop culture podcast, "The Worst of All Possible Worlds," was the source of the account impersonating Mayor Eric Adams of New York, promising to create a traffic and parking department and cut police funding.
Mr. Boerman said he had tried hard to leave obvious hints that he was an impersonator. His tweet thread included unrealistic scenarios where all police officers' guns were melted down and sold for scrap, with the proceeds going to the parks department. He made up an organization with a ludicrous name: the New York City Porcine Benevolent Association. He promoted his podcast to his relatively small Twitter following of 1,700 users.
"Pretty much everybody got that it was a joke immediately, which was my hope -- I wasn't trying to mislead anyone," Mr. Boerman said. "The point was that this can be both a joke on the state of the network right now as well as an opportunity to think about the way that media is disseminated and how we think about our public figures."
The removal of the blue verification badges caused "immediate and pure chaos," but the novelty eventually wore off, he said. His profile name is now "bosh (not mayor anymore)." He said he was careful to confirm any announcement he saw on Twitter using other sources.
"The problem comes when you have accounts that maybe have hundreds of thousands of followers and are positioning themselves as the real thing," Mr. Boerman said. "Twitter's approach of 'Well, if people pay for verification, certainly they must be legit' is so inane I don't even know how to put words to it."

SAN FRANCISCO — In the 24 hours after Twitter last week eliminated the blue check mark that historically served as a means of identifying public agencies, at least 11 new accounts began impersonating the Los Angeles Police Department.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue and global editorial director of Condé Nast, has been the maestro of every Met Gala since 1999. But this time, it's personal.
Not just because the exhibition the party honors is devoted to the work of the much celebrated designer Karl Lagerfeld, who died in 2019, but because Mr. Lagerfeld was one of Ms. Wintour's closest friends for decades. He created the clothes that, she said, "I've worn to the most important events in my life -- to my wedding, to my children's weddings, to Met Galas and state dinners and tennis championships at which I watched my heroes compete for their dreams."
For her, she said, Mr. Lagerfeld's designs were "a uniform, a kind of armor and a way of holding certain moods and memories close. His fashion does for me what fashion should. It makes me feel more confident in being myself."
Now, when she wears his work, she said, "I still feel that I have him near." The Times asked Ms. Wintour to pick some of the favorite Lagerfeld designs that still hang in her closet and describe the memories they evoke.
'I don't remember when or where I first met Karl, or what I was wearing.'
The AmfAR Gala Dress
I wore this collaged Chanel dress to the amfAR gala in New York alongside Hillary Clinton when she was in the middle of her first term as senator in 2003. I wanted to feel both chic and confident. I was delighted when, some years later, my daughter-in-law, Elizabeth, wore the same dress to her first Met Gala. Karl, who liked to strike a pose against nostalgia, took one look at her and said, "Recycled!" In fact, Karl's dresses are enthusiastically recycled in my family, treated with reverence -- but not too much. My daughter, Bee, is planning on wearing this dress to a Met after-party this year.
Honestly, I don't remember when or where I first met Karl, or what I was wearing. I was probably nervous, because I was always nervous meeting people in the early years of my career. What's certain is that he quickly put me at ease. He loved meeting people, and he loved to talk. We were both masters of compartmentalization -- we kept our working lives quite separate from our friendship -- and when we met socially, fashion was never our subject.
Karl was interested in so much else and seemed eager to escape the snow globe of his public life. In public, he embraced his image as the high priest of chic and surfaces and whatever was absolutely new. In private -- a side he guarded far more carefully -- he was different.
'Karl's dresses are enthusiastically recycled in my family.'
The Paint Box Dress
I first wore this paint box dress, inspired by the colored paints and pencils that Karl always kept scattered across his desk, to a fantastically over-the-top Chanel extravaganza that he arranged in Dallas a decade ago, one of the first such runway productions in unlikely locations. (This "traveling" model for fashion shows, breaking away from the staid runways in Paris or Milan, was enormously influential because Karl did it. Other houses soon followed.) This event was complete with a drive-in movie theater, a bucking-bronco ride and a rodeo.
Since then, that paint box dress has been to many tamer parties in our family, including my son Charlie's wedding. Bee has also worn it to possibly too many of the weddings of her friends.
'We'd exchange a few words or a text or two, and from these Karl was able to draw what would be just right.'
The Trompe L'oeil Dress
Karl's dresses don't seem to age or date to a specific era. They stay with us as we cross time and live our different lives. This trompe l'oeil dress, a homage to Coco Chanel's love of jewelry, was part of Karl's first Chanel couture collection in 1983. It had been in my closet for a good long time before I found the perfect occasion to wear it at President Biden's state dinner for Emmanuel Macron.
Over the years, Karl designed some dresses specially for me, but we never talked about what these should be. It was more like osmosis. We'd exchange a few words or a text or two about an occasion, and from these Karl was able to draw what would be just right -- for the event but also for me. He absorbed a lot more from people than he showed.
However broad his own interests, he always seemed to have room for other people's, and over the years he sent me vintage prints in honor of my love of tennis and porcelain. Karl didn't play tennis, and he didn't care for porcelain the way I did, but it was his quiet way of being attuned to other people's minds.
'In the early days of our friendship we would meet at the Café de Flore, where Karl was a habitué.'
The Feather Skirt
Karl was always sending me sketches that he could create in an instant but might just as quickly ball up and toss away. One of them shows us on the dance floor, a memento of the ways we used to spend our time together in Paris. In the early days of our friendship we would meet at the Café de Flore, where Karl was a habitué. Later, he'd take me to chaotically planned, totally glamorous dinners at his house, and those incredible nights often ended with dancing.
Karl was a great dancer, and a greater night owl. As we got older and wiser and outwardly more respectable, we gave up the late nights and the Café de Flore, and I persuaded him to meet me for dinner at my hotel (Karl was perpetually, sometimes preposterously, late, and this way I found I could get some work done while I waited for him to show up). But the feathery skirt from that sketch, both ethereal and down to earth, is a reminder of that era of late-night dancing.
When one of his late parties ended, he would go home and, alone, read Hegel and sketch deep into the night. He sent me books constantly, in volume -- strange, unexpected books of the kind known only to people who spend time prowling the backs of shops.
Once I was supposed to fly across the Atlantic to present him with an award in London. I'm not wonderful at adjusting to time differences, and I don't particularly like public speaking. I am always early -- in this case arriving two days in advance -- and on the day of the event, a few hours before it began, I got a vaguely alarming text: Karl was just taking off from Paris. A couple of hours later, another one: Karl had landed and was in the car, but had stopped off at a bookshop.
About an hour before the presentation, there was a third: Karl is on his way but wanted to visit a gallery. Finally, within seconds of our curtain call, Karl burst into the wings with an entourage of 15 and his usual surprised "Am I late?" We were swept onstage.
'His favorite dress on me.'
The Gold Trompe L'oeil Dress
Karl's Chanel suits put me in mind of his dogged, unexpected strength. They are uniform and armor, a testament to slow and controlled change, but there's something vividly human in them, too. When we went together to the 2014 opening of the Foundation Louis Vuitton in Paris, Karl told me that my gold trompe l'oeil dress was his favorite on me of any piece I'd worn. Since then, I've worn it many times. It's Karl at his finest: the classic profile made new, the sparkle and simplicity, the way it puts forward an idea of strength in femininity.
Karl frequently surprised the world as a designer (he loved to turn heads), but it was as a friend that he surprised me most. Many years ago, when I was facing my first summer vacation with my children after my divorce, I was frozen. I wanted to show them a good time, but I felt in pieces. It was Karl, of all people, who sensed this and swooped in to lend a hand.
He had a vacation house in Europe, by the beach, he told us, and we should spend some time there. When we arrived, to my surprise, he'd planned a whole summer camp's worth of activities for my young children -- surfing lessons on the beach, day trips to the nearby art museum, dancing after dinner in the evenings. Karl was perhaps even less a kid person than he was a porcelain person, but he went all out when I most needed it. That isn't something you forget. A real relationship with Karl was an association and connection built incrementally, over years.
'I wore a lot of short skirts at the time, but none more happily.'
The Short Skirt Suit
Karl could be serious, but I'll remember his tremendous sense of fun. In the early 1990s he designed a lot of very short skirts. We photographed a spread of them in Vogue, and I kept wondering whether the skirts were short enough. Whether in consideration of this question, or simply as a way of teasing me, he sent me a short skirt suit of my own. I wore a lot of short skirts at the time, but none more happily than his.
Or there was the benefit Chanel staged in the meatpacking district in 1991, when the uptown crowd descended to West 12th Street in an endless array of buckled leather and ruffled tulle, all of it Chanel. I remember a journalist asking him if he had ever seen so many middle-aged women in biker jackets and miniskirts. Karl's reply was quintessential Karl, generous and coolly deadpan: "As far as I'm concerned there are no middle-aged women."
'He was always looking ahead to the next thing.'
The Poppy Met Dress
I never wholly figured out his contradictions. He was someone who could be rigorous in his diet, which was notoriously stringent and health-minded, and then consume a tsunami of Diet Coke. He had his love of books and magazines and printed matter but also needed the very latest technology and devices at his fingertips. He was always looking ahead to the next thing, to the future -- with a fear, I always felt, of falling behind, of being caught out.
He would have been alarmed to find himself the subject of an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. But "A Line of Beauty" is an appreciation and embodiment of his genius. Since 2005, I have worn his dresses to almost every opening gala for the Costume Institute that I have co-hosted. This poppy dress, which I wore to the "China: Through the Looking Glass" show in 2015, was an example of Karl's dexterity and quick wits at his desk. On the runway, it was short, but, with a sweep of his pencil, it became ankle-length -- and it worked beautifully that way.
Our friendship meant everything to me, and I miss him deeply. I am grateful for all the moments, such as this one, that can bring his work to life and, in the process, keep him near.

Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue and global editorial director of Condé Nast, has been the maestro of every Met Gala since 1999. But this time, it’s personal.
Not just because the exhibition that the party honors is devoted to the work of much celebrated designer Karl Lagerfeld, who died in 2019, but because Lagerfeld was one of Wintour’s closest friends for decades. He created the clothes that, she said, “I’ve worn to the most important events in my life — to my wedding, to my children’s weddings, to Met Galas and state dinners and tennis championships at which I watched my heroes compete for their dreams.”
For her, she said, Lagerfeld’s designs were “a uniform, a kind of armor and a way of holding certain moods and memories close. His fashion does for me what fashion should. It makes me feel more confident in being myself.”
Now, when she wears his work, she said, “I still feel that I have him near.” The New York Times asked Wintour to pick some of the favorite Lagerfeld designs that still hang in her closet and describe the memories they evoke.
The AmfAR Gala Dress
I wore this collaged Chanel dress to the amfAR gala in New York alongside Hillary Clinton when she was in the middle of her first term as senator in 2003. I wanted to feel both chic and confident. I was delighted when, some years later, my daughter-in-law, Elizabeth, wore the same dress to her first Met Gala. Karl, who liked to strike a pose against nostalgia, took one look at her and said, “Recycled!” In fact, Karl’s dresses are enthusiastically recycled in my family, treated with reverence — but not too much. My daughter, Bee, is planning on wearing this dress to a Met after-party this year.
Honestly, I don’t remember when or where I first met Karl, or what I was wearing. I was probably nervous, because I was always nervous meeting people in the early years of my career. What’s certain is that he quickly put me at ease. He loved meeting people, and he loved to talk. We were both masters of compartmentalization — we kept our working lives quite separate from our friendship — and when we met socially, fashion was never our subject.
Karl was interested in so much else and seemed eager to escape the snow globe of his public life. In public, he embraced his image as the high priest of chic and surfaces and whatever was absolutely new. In private — a side he guarded far more carefully — he was different.
The Paint Box Dress
I first wore this paint box dress, inspired by the colored paints and pencils that Karl always kept scattered across his desk, to a fantastically over-the-top Chanel extravaganza that he arranged in Dallas a decade ago, one of the first such runway productions in unlikely locations. (This “traveling” model for fashion shows, breaking away from the staid runways in Paris or Milan, was enormously influential because Karl did it. Other houses soon followed.) This event was complete with a drive-in movie theater, a bucking-bronco ride and a rodeo.
Since then, that paint box dress has been to many tamer parties in our family, including my son Charlie’s wedding. Bee has also worn it to possibly too many of the weddings of her friends.
The Trompe L’oeil Dress
Karl’s dresses don’t seem to age or date to a specific era. They stay with us as we cross time and live our different lives. This trompe l’oeil dress, an homage to Coco Chanel’s love of jewelry, was part of Karl’s first Chanel couture collection in 1983. It had been in my closet for a good long time before I found the perfect occasion to wear it at President Biden’s state dinner for Emmanuel Macron.
Over the years, Karl designed some dresses specially for me, but we never talked about what these should be. It was more like osmosis. We’d exchange a few words or a text or two about an occasion, and from these Karl was able to draw what would be just right — for the event but also for me. He absorbed a lot more from people than he showed.
However broad his own interests, he always seemed to have room for other people’s, and over the years he sent me vintage prints in honor of my love of tennis and porcelain. Karl didn’t play tennis, and he didn’t care for porcelain the way I did, but it was his quiet way of being attuned to other people’s minds.
The Feather Skirt
Karl was always sending me sketches that he could create in an instant but might just as quickly ball up and toss away. One of them shows us on the dance floor, a memento of the ways we used to spend our time together in Paris. In the early days of our friendship we would meet at the Café de Flore, where Karl was a habitué. Later, he’d take me to chaotically planned, totally glamorous dinners at his house, and those incredible nights often ended with dancing.
Karl was a great dancer, and a greater night owl. As we got older and wiser and outwardly more respectable, we gave up the late nights and the Café de Flore, and I persuaded him to meet me for dinner at my hotel (Karl was perpetually, sometimes preposterously, late, and this way I found I could get some work done while I waited for him to show up). But the feathery skirt from that sketch, both ethereal and down to earth, is a reminder of that era of late-night dancing.
When one of his late parties ended, he would go home and, alone, read Hegel and sketch deep into the night. He sent me books constantly, in volume — strange, unexpected books of the kind known only to people who spend time prowling the backs of shops.
Once I was supposed to fly across the Atlantic to present him with an award in London. I’m not wonderful at adjusting to time differences, and I don’t particularly like public speaking. I am always early — in this case arriving two days in advance — and on the day of the event, a few hours before it began, I got a vaguely alarming text: Karl was just taking off from Paris. A couple of hours later, another one: Karl had landed and was in the car, but had stopped off at a bookshop.
About an hour before the presentation, there was a third: Karl is on his way but wanted to visit a gallery. Finally, within seconds of our curtain call, Karl burst into the wings with an entourage of 15 and his usual surprised “Am I late?” We were swept onstage.
The Gold Trompe L’oeil Dress
Karl’s Chanel suits put me in mind of his dogged, unexpected strength. They are uniform and armor, a testament to slow and controlled change, but there’s something vividly human in them, too. When we went together to the 2014 opening of the Foundation Louis Vuitton in Paris, Karl told me that my gold trompe l’oeil dress was his favorite on me of any piece I’d worn. Since then, I’ve worn it many times. It’s Karl at his finest: the classic profile made new, the sparkle and simplicity, the way it puts forward an idea of strength in femininity.
Karl frequently surprised the world as a designer (he loved to turn heads), but it was as a friend that he surprised me most. Many years ago, when I was facing my first summer vacation with my children after my divorce, I was frozen. I wanted to show them a good time, but I felt in pieces. It was Karl, of all people, who sensed this and swooped in to lend a hand.
He had a vacation house in Europe, by the beach, he told us, and we should spend some time there. When we arrived, to my surprise, he’d planned a whole summer camp’s worth of activities for my young children — surfing lessons on the beach, day trips to the nearby art museum, dancing after dinner in the evenings. Karl was perhaps even less a kid person than he was a porcelain person, but he went all out when I most needed it. That isn’t something you forget. A real relationship with Karl was an association and connection built incrementally, over years.
The Short-Skirt Suit
Karl could be serious, but I’ll remember his tremendous sense of fun. In the early 1990s he designed a lot of very short skirts. We photographed a spread of them in Vogue, and I kept wondering whether the skirts were short enough. Whether in consideration of this question, or simply as a way of teasing me, he sent me a short-skirt suit of my own. I wore a lot of short skirts at the time, but none more happily than his.
Or there was the benefit Chanel staged in the meatpacking district in 1991, when the uptown crowd descended to West 12th Street in an endless array of buckled leather and ruffled tulle, all of it Chanel. I remember a journalist asking him if he had ever seen so many middle-aged women in biker jackets and miniskirts. Karl’s reply was quintessential Karl, generous and coolly deadpan: “As far as I’m concerned there are no middle-aged women.”
The Poppy Met Dress
I never wholly figured out his contradictions. He was someone who could be rigorous in his diet, which was notoriously stringent and health-minded, and then consume a tsunami of Diet Coke. He had his love of books and magazines and printed matter but also needed the very latest technology and devices at his fingertips. He was always looking ahead to the next thing, to the future — with a fear, I always felt, of falling behind, of being caught out.
He would have been alarmed to find himself the subject of an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. But “A Line of Beauty” is an appreciation and embodiment of his genius. Since 2005, I have worn his dresses to almost every opening gala for the Costume Institute that I have co-hosted. This poppy dress, which I wore to the “China Through the Looking Glass” show in 2015, was an example of Karl’s dexterity and quick wits at his desk. On the runway, it was short, but, with a sweep of his pencil, it became ankle length — and it worked beautifully that way.
Our friendship meant everything to me, and I miss him deeply. I am grateful for all the moments, such as this one, that can bring his work to life and, in the process, keep him near.

U.S. Vows Crackdown
On Illegal A.I. Practices
The government will "not hesitate to crack down" on harmful business practices involving artificial intelligence, the head of the Federal Trade Commission warned Tuesday in a message partly directed at the developers of widely used A.I. tools such as ChatGPT.
Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, joined top officials from civil rights and consumer protection agencies to put businesses on notice that regulators are working to track and stop illegal behavior in the use and development of biased or deceptive A.I. tools.
Much of the scrutiny has been on those who deploy automated tools that amplify bias in decisions about who to hire, how worker productivity is monitored or who gets access to housing and loans.
But Ms. Khan also raised the possibility of the F.T.C. wielding its antitrust authority to protect competition, adding that the commission would watch for "unfair, deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition." ASSOCIATED PRESS

PepsiCo Beats Forecasts,
Helped by Price Increases
PepsiCo raised its annual forecasts on Tuesday after price increases undertaken to offset higher costs and steady demand helped the company's first-quarter results beat estimates.
The results pointed to a resilient consumer and followed similar quarterly performances by Coca-Cola and Nestlé. PepsiCo's shares rose more than 2 percent in trading on Tuesday.
Sales in the North America beverage unit, PepsiCo's largest business, rose 8 percent in the quarter. Net revenue rose 10 percent to $ 17.85 billion, topping estimates of $ 17.22 billion. Adjusted profit of $ 1.50 per share also beat estimates of $ 1.39. Average prices jumped 16 percent in the first quarter, PepsiCo said.
PepsiCo expects 2023 revenue to rise 8 percent, compared with its prior forecast of 6 percent.
Global consumer goods companies have raised prices since the pandemic to battle a jump in costs of raw materials, labor and shipping. PepsiCo also plans to raise prices in some regions, in contrast to an earlier decision to hit a pause. REUTERS

McDonald's Customers
Buoy Sales in Quarter
McDonald's reported higher-than-expected sales in the first quarter as store traffic grew despite higher prices.
Global same-store sales rose 12.6 percent compared to the January-March period last year, the Chicago burger giant said Tuesday, well above the 8.7 percent increase analysts forecast.
Good weather in January helped increase sales. There was also a steady recovery in China after Covid restrictions were lifted, McDonald's said.
Marketing campaigns, like a McSpicy chicken sandwich promotion with a streetwear brand in China, and a Valentine's Day meal promotion in the U.S. with rappers Offset and Cardi B, also buoyed the chain's performance.
Chris Kempczinski, the chief executive, said McDonald's was starting to see price resistance. Customers may not add fries to an order, for example, and delivery orders have slowed, he said.

Biden Has Something He'd Like to Tell You: [Op-Ed]

Author: Collins, Gail; Stephens, Bret

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gail Collins: Well, Bret, it looks like Joe Biden will be announcing his re-election bid this week.
Bret Stephens: Proving my prediction from last week dead wrong.
Gail: I know you disagree with him on many issues, particularly relating to the economy.
But given the likely Republican presidential candidates, any chance you'll actually be able to avoid voting for him?
Bret: Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Probably not.
It says something about the state of the Republican Party that the two current front-runners -- let's call them Don Caligula and Ron Torquemada -- are nonstarters for a voter like me. And I'm a guy who believes in low taxes, a strong military, broken-windows policing, entitlement reform, a border wall and school choice. That's the Nikki Haley side of the party -- now reduced to single digits of the G.O.P. base.
Gail: Sorry about Haley's failure to take flight. I know you were rooting for her.
Bret: Well, I'm still holding out hopes -- increasingly faint though they are.
On the other hand, I really, really wish Biden weren't running, for all the reasons we've discussed. He's just not a convincing candidate. And for all the talk of Donald Trump being unelectable in the general election, we've heard those predictions before. All it might take is a recession -- which is probably coming -- for swing voters to care a lot less about abortion rights in Florida or the Jan. 6 attempted coup than they will about jobs and the economy.
Aren't you a wee bit nervous?
Gail: Nervous? Just because we're talking about a presidential election in which one of the two major parties nominates either a loony ex-president drowning in legal problems or a deeply unappealing, extremely right-wing enemy of Disney World?
Bret: It's a game of Russian roulette, played with three bullets in the six-shooter.
Gail: As for the Democrats, I've already told you I think 80 is too old to be planning another presidential campaign. And Biden has been around so long, it's hard to make anything he talks about doing sound exciting.
But what you're worried about -- a popular reaction against a bad economy -- would be a problem for anybody in the party.
Bret: True, but Amy Klobuchar or Gretchen Whitmer or some other plausible nominee can't be accused of owning the economy the way Biden can.
Gail: Biden certainly has negatives. But Trump has a lot more -- all way more dire. And even if Ron DeSantis weren't a terrible campaigner, I can't see him winning over the electorate with his past plans to torpedo Medicare.
Bret: You're probably right about DeSantis, who seems too obsessed trying to slay Mickey and Minnie to appeal to regular voters outside Florida. As for Trump, this is a strange thing to say, but: The guy has demon energy. You know the movie "Cocaine Bear"? Trump is "Diet Coke Cujo," if you get my Stephen King reference.
Gail: Yeah, he's never boring. Sigh. But we'll see how energetic he looks when he's defending himself for falsifying business records and all the other investigations that await him.
Alas, we'll be conversing about this for a very long time, Bret. On the more immediate horizon, there's the Fox News-Dominion settlement. Tell me your thoughts.
Bret: I am sorry we didn't get to watch Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and the rest of the gang of cynical, lying, repulsive and wretched propagandists squirm under oath in courtroom testimony. Would have paid money just to see that.
But realistically speaking, it's probably the best possible result. It's the closest Fox will ever come to admitting guilt, $ 787.5 million is rich vindication for Dominion, and it spares us the possibility of an appeals process that might have ended with the Supreme Court revisiting the strict libel standards of Times v. Sullivan and potentially limiting the freedom of the press.
Gail: Yeah, for all my daydreams about Fox celebrities having to get up in court and apologize to the nation, in the real world this is probably the best you can get while protecting all the rights of a free press.
Bret: The good news, Gail, is that Dominion still has suits pending against Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Newsmax and Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy, along with a few others. And there's also the pending Smartmatic suit against Fox.
Having fun, making bank and doing good at the expense of creeps has got to be the greatest joy adults can have in a boardroom.
But we mentioned the Supreme Court. Any thoughts on the mifepristone ruling, staying the lower court's ban on the abortion pill? I'm relieved, of course, that the court will allow the pill to remain on the market.
Gail: Well, this is the nice thing about a democracy. You have the powers that be suddenly realizing the public is totally not on their side. So they fudge a little, dodge a little and quietly backtrack.
Bret: It'll be some irony if Republicans come to rue last year's Dobbs decision for making them unelectable in all but the reddest parts of the country -- and Democrats come to celebrate it for helping them cement a long-term majority that eventually changes the composition of the court so that abortion rights are restored.
Gail: But we're still a long way from living in a country where every woman has the right to control her own body when it comes to reproduction issues.
Bret: As the dissents from Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in the mifepristone ruling make clear ....
Gail: I've always wanted to see state lawmakers from both sides get together on a package of reforms that would couple abortion rights with easily available, easily affordable health and counseling services for poor pregnant women.
Along, of course, with high-quality child care for low-income working mothers. Ahem.
Bret: Gail, would it shock you to know that I don't disagree with anything you just said? Of course, child care won't solve the root of so many of our problems, which is the near destruction of stable two-parent families in too many poor households. But that's a disaster whose cure lies beyond a government's ability to solve.
Gail: Wow -- government support for high-quality early education? I think I'm hearing a major change of heart. If so, gonna buy a very nice bottle of wine for dinner tonight and drink a toast to you.
Bret: I tend to soften in your presence.
Gail: Awww. Well, go on -- back to the issues of the day.
Bret: Speaking of disasters, your thoughts on Biden's E.P.A. rule controlling emissions from power plants?
Gail: A worthy effort to protect future generations from environmental disaster, and of course, the Republicans hate it.
Bret: There should be a better way of saving the planet than by using administrative means to impose high costs on industry that will inevitably be passed along to consumers in the form of higher energy prices -- which also hit poorer people harder -- while setting wildly unrealistic target dates for an energy transition.
Notice that I'm saying this and I still will probably have no choice but to vote for Biden. Unbelievable.
Gail: Our colleague Jim Tankersley wrote a great analysis about the ongoing crisis over raising the debt limit, which has got to get done this spring. And how more than half of the Republicans' 320-page version of a debt limit bill is actually about removing clean energy restrictions.
Bret: I'd need to see the fine print before making a judgment, but a lot of what passes for "clean energy," like biofuels, is really a dirty-energy, big government, big business boondoggle. As for the debt limit, it wouldn't be a bad thing if Biden showed any willingness to meet Republicans halfway on spending cuts and work requirements for able-bodied adults taking federal subsidies.
Gail: Bret, the debt limit is ... something responsible people take care of without creating a political crisis with demands they'll never achieve.
But hey, that's a mean way to end our talk. You're always great about telling me about something new you've just read. Go ahead.
Bret: Gail, I have to recommend Katie Hafner's smart and humane obituary on Richard Riordan, the last Republican mayor of Los Angeles and a man who brought calm good sense to a city reeling from riots and racial strife. Riordan was a warts-and-all kind of guy, who cracked some dumb jokes that would have probably been politically fatal in our cancel-culture age. But he also brought common sense and a strong work ethic to his job and embodied a Republican pragmatism that we could sorely use today. He was the last of nine children born to an Irish Catholic family -- California is better because his parents were persistent.

2 States Weigh Bans on Common Food Additives: [Science Desk]

Author: Smith, Dana G

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Here's what to know about the five chemicals, which most often show up in baked goods, candy and soda.
Newly proposed bills in California and New York are putting food additives -- the chemicals manufacturers add to food to act as preservatives or to enhance color, texture or taste -- under the microscope.
The state legislators are seeking to prohibit the manufacturing and sale of products containing additives that have been linked to cancer, neurodevelopmental issues and hormone dysfunction. The five additives named in the bills are most commonly found in baked goods, candy and soda and are almost totally banned in food products in Europe. Several health associations, including the Endocrine Society and the American Academy of Pediatrics, have raised concerns about the potential health harms of food additives as a whole.
The bills, if approved, would both go into effect in 2025. The sponsors of the California bill, Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel and Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, said the restrictions would especially protect children, who are more susceptible than adults to the potential risks.
"Kids eat more, pound for pound," said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a professor of pediatrics at NYU Langone Health who specializes in environmental health. "Their developing organs are especially vulnerable."
The New York Times asked experts about these five additives and how to avoid or limit exposure if you are concerned.
What are the five additives in the bills?
When deciding which to include, the state legislators, collaborating with the nonprofits Consumer Reports and the Environmental Working Group, looked for additives that were prohibited in Europe and still widely used in the U.S., and where research showed strong evidence of health risks.
"These five were truly the worst of the worst," said Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group.
Red dye No. 3 is used in nearly 3,000 food products, including icings, nutritional shakes, maraschino cherries and peppermint-, berry- and cherry-flavored candies. It has been shown to cause cancer in animals, which prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to ban its use in cosmetics in 1990. At the time, the agency said it would work to extend the ban to food, but the chemical remains in use today. There are also concerns that it and other synthetic food dyes may contribute to behavioral problems, such as hyperactivity, in children.
Titanium dioxide acts as a whitener, color enhancer and anti-caking agent in thousands of food items. It's present in many candies, as well as baked goods, creamy salad dressings and frozen dairy products, like cheese pizza and ice cream. A safety assessment conducted by the European Food Safety Authority in 2021 concluded that titanium dioxide damages DNA and can harm the immune system, resulting in its ban in the E.U. in 2022.
Brominated vegetable oil serves as an emulsifier in fruit drinks and sodas. Research in rats -- including a study published by the F.D.A. in 2022 -- suggests that brominated vegetable oil acts as an endocrine disrupter, especially affecting the thyroid hormone. An earlier study found that it can also harm the reproductive system. Because of its potential risks, many large brands, including Coca-Cola and Pepsi, recently stopped using the chemical, but it's still in some smaller and grocery store beverage brands.
Potassium bromate is primarily found in baked goods, including breads, cookies and tortillas, where it acts as a leavening agent and improves texture. The additive is classified as being "possibly carcinogenic to humans" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, based on studies conducted in animals.
Propylparaben is a preservative used in packaged baked goods, particularly pastries and tortillas. It's also present in many cosmetics and personal care products. Numerous studies, in humans and animals, indicate that propylparaben acts as an endocrine disrupter and affects male and female reproductive health.
"If you need to start somewhere, these five are great," said Dr. Sheela Sathyanarayana, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington who researches endocrine disrupters. "They have strong health data, they are widely used in many products, so likely there's very large-scale exposure."
How does the F.D.A. regulate these additives?
In response to the California bill, which was released ahead of New York's, a coalition of food industry companies wrote an opposition letter stating that, "All five of these additives have been thoroughly reviewed by the federal and state systems and many international scientific bodies and continue to be deemed safe." A spokesman for the National Confectioners Association, a trade organization that represents candy manufacturers, echoed this in an email to The Times, saying their members adhere to F.D.A. guidelines.
An F.D.A. official wrote in an email to The Times that the agency evaluates food additives based on a number of factors, including the "amount expected to be consumed (dietary exposure)" and "laboratory studies supporting safety."
In practice, however, many chemicals are approved under a provision known as Generally Recognized As Safe, which states that a food additive can forego review by the F.D.A. if it has been deemed safe by "qualified experts."
If concerns arise after a chemical is already approved, or if new, relevant research becomes available, "The F.D.A. does re-evaluate the safety of ingredients," the agency official wrote. For example, the F.D.A. reviewed the evidence about titanium dioxide after the E.U. decided to ban it in 2022. The resulting report determined that there was "no evidence to suggest dietary exposure to the additive is a concern for human health."
One point of contention is that the vast majority of the research on these additives has been done in animals because it is difficult (and unethical) to conduct toxicology research in humans. As a result, "It's impossible to say that eliminating Red 3 or titanium dioxide from the American diet will reduce the number of people who suffer from cancer by a certain amount with total precision," Mr. Faber said. "But anything that we can do to reduce our exposure to carcinogens, whether known or suspected carcinogens, is a step in the right direction."
Dr. Sathyanarayana added that, "Although one individual food may not have a potentially harmful exposure concentration, the fact that we eat so many foods, it starts to add up in the body. And our regulatory system misses that entire concept."
How can I avoid these additives if I'm concerned?
The best way to steer clear of potentially hazardous food additives is to avoid eating prepared, processed foods and instead stick to fresh ingredients. If you are buying something packaged, be sure to read labels. Dr. Sathyanarayana said a good rule of thumb is to opt for foods with short ingredient lists and to skip foods with ingredients you can't pronounce. She mentioned the preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite, and meat with bovine growth hormone as other chemicals to try to avoid.
According to the Environmental Working Group, over the past few years, several food manufacturers and grocery store chains have stopped using or selling products containing some or all of these additives. All five of the additives have chemical substitutes that serve the same purpose and have been deemed to be safer for human consumption -- but they're more expensive. If the bills are passed, it could motivate more brands to follow suit because it might not be economically prudent to produce one batch of products for California and New York and another for the rest of the U.S.
Some experts say the bills don't go far enough. Instead, they say a complete overhaul of the F.D.A.'s review process is necessary.
"While I appreciate that it's expedient to focus on five chemicals, it really misses a broader problem and a systemic problem," Dr. Trasande said. In a policy statement he and Dr. Sathyanarayana wrote on behalf of the American Academy of Pediatrics, they call for nine changes to how the federal government regulates food additives.
Similarly, Mr. Faber called the Generally Recognized As Safe review process a "loophole" that should be closed, saying that many of the outside experts who do the reviews are employed by the chemical companies that manufacture the additives.
"Consumers can certainly read labels and avoid these chemicals, but it shouldn't be up to consumers to keep us safe," he said. "We have an F.D.A. that was charged in 1958 to ensure the safety of these food chemicals, and the F.D.A. has let us down."

Markets Hold Breath Ahead of New Data: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street remained stuck in its standstill on Monday, and stocks again moved only modestly ahead of reports that could offer more clarity on the direction of the economy and corporate profits.
The S&P 500 edged up by 3.52 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,137.04 after barely budging last week. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 66.44, or 0.2 percent, to 33,875.40, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 35.25, or 0.3 percent, to 12,037.20.
Coca-Cola fell 0.2 percent after it reported stronger-than-expected profit for the first quarter but refrained from raising forecasts for sales and other measures for the full year. It was the only company in the S&P 500 to report Monday morning, but more than 170 others are scheduled to follow it this week.
The question is whether they can clear the low bar that Wall Street has set for them, and what chief executives say about their prospects for profits later this year. Analysts expect S&P 500 companies to report their worst drop in earnings since the spring of 2020, when the pandemic paralyzed the economy.
Some of Wall Street's most influential companies are set to report this week, including Microsoft on Tuesday and Amazon on Thursday. Several of these big tech stocks were among the heaviest weights on the market. Microsoft fell 1.4 percent, and Amazon dipped 0.7 percent.
Fox fell 2.9 percent after it said the prime-time host Tucker Carlson was leaving Fox News. The move came less than a week after the company reached a $ 787.5 million settlement over charges that it promoted lies about Dominion Voting Systems through its 2020 election coverage.
Bed Bath & Beyond was another loser, dropping 35.7 percent to 19 cents after filing for bankruptcy protection. Its stock has been on a wild ride as investors bet on whether it could successfully turn around its operations.
So far this earnings reporting season, the majority of companies have been topping forecasts, as is usually the case. That is partly because expectations were so low coming into it. Inflation remains high, and interest rates are much higher than a year earlier, which has hurt swaths of the economy.
The Federal Reserve has jacked up rates at a furious pace in hopes of undercutting high inflation. High rates can do that but only by bluntly slowing the entire economy. That increases the chances of a recession, while also hurting prices for investments.
Besides this week's blizzard of earnings reports, Wall Street was also waiting for the first estimate of how quickly the U.S. economy grew in the first three months of the year. Economists predict it will show growth slowed to 1.9 percent at an annual rate, from 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter.
Higher rates have already slowed the housing market by making mortgages more expensive. Manufacturing and other areas of the economy have also been hurt, while the job market has remained remarkably resilient.
The report on the U.S. economy will be one of the final pieces of data before the Federal Reserve's next meeting, scheduled for next week. Much of Wall Street expects it to raise interest rates at least one more time, before it most likely takes a pause.
Many traders are betting the Fed will have to cut rates later this year to prop up the economy. But the Fed has been insistent that it will hold rates at a higher level at least through the end of this year.
"The Fed seems determined to fight inflation even if a more significant slowdown arrives," Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson wrote in a report.
High rates have already caused cracks in the banking system, with the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history rocking markets last month. The worst of the crisis seems to have passed, but scrutiny is still high on smaller and midsize banks, which seem to be under the biggest threat of customers' yanking their deposits.

Full text: COMPANIES
Disney to Lay Off 7,000 Throughout Its Units
The Walt Disney Co. will be laying off several thousand employees this week, a second round of cuts that's part of a previously announced plan to eliminate 7,000 jobs this year.
The latest employee releases will take place Monday through Thursday, according to Disney officials. The company will have reached approximately 4,000 job cuts when factoring in both the first and second rounds of layoffs.
The job eliminations are taking place across various business segments, including entertainment, ESPN, parks, experiences and products. The cuts are also occurring in various locations, including Burbank, Calif., New York and Connecticut. The company previously said that it didn't expect job cuts to impact frontline operations roles at its parks and resorts.
Disney anticipates a third round of job cuts starting before the beginning of the summer in order to hit the 7,000 eliminations target. ASSOCIATED PRESS
EARNINGS
China Rebound Helps Coke's Strong Quarter
Coca-Cola Co. reported higher-than-expected sales in the first quarter as it continued to hike prices and its business in China improved.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $ 11 billion for the January-March period, the company said Monday. That beat Wall Street's expectations. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast revenue of $ 10.8 billion.
Coke's chairman and C.E.O., James Quincey, said higher demand at restaurants and robust new year celebrations in China were a stark comparison with last year, when a new variant of the coronavirus depressed demand.
But higher prices also boosted sales. Pricing and mix -- which includes changes in package sizes -- contributed 11 percent to revenue growth while concentrate sales rose 1 percent. Price and mix grew by 12 percent in each of the previous three quarters.
Mr. Quincey said Coke is trying to satisfy customers looking for value, with deals on multi-packs. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Subway Sales Up 12.1%
As It Explores a Sale
Subway said on Monday that its global comparable sales were 12.1 percent higher in the first quarter and that guest visits rose, driven in part by restaurant renovations.
The privately held sandwich chain is looking to boost store-level profits as it explores a possible sale, hoping to show potential private equity buyers that it can be a moneymaker.
Subway had been closing locations in recent years amid a host of problems including outdated décor and operations, overexpansion and $ 5 foot-long deals that eroded franchisees' profits.
In 2021, the chain launched a menu overhaul and splashy marketing campaign as it embarked on a turnaround plan.
In February, the company said it is exploring a sale that could value it at as much as $ 10 billion, as it faces competition from growing rivals including Jimmy John's, Firehouse Subs, Jersey Mike's Subs and Potbelly. REUTERS

Ex-Santos Aide Also Traveled A Murky Path: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nancy Marks, Mr. Santos's former campaign treasurer, has her own history of questionable dealings that have aroused interest from federal investigators.
When George Santos was a political neophyte struggling to launch his first bid for Congress in the suburbs of New York City, he made a consequential early hire.
He brought on Nancy Marks, a fixture in Long Island Republican circles, to serve as campaign treasurer. Over the next three years, she used her deep ties to local Republicans and her stable of businesses to become indispensable to the campaign and to Mr. Santos.
She helped him meet donors and signed off on nearly every campaign invoice and financial filing. In May 2021, records show, the two even briefly went into business together as political consultants.
Now, as federal and local prosecutors examine the web of deceit Mr. Santos spun on his way to winning a closely contested House seat last November, they appear to be focused on a trail of financial dealings that suggests possible campaign finance violations or outright fraud. Campaign filings listed donations that exceeded the legal limit, hundreds of thousands of dollars in unexplained spending and a strange string of expenses for $ 199.99 -- just pennies below the threshold beyond which receipts are required.
No one may be more central to that inquiry than Ms. Marks, who was, until now, an unheralded cog in New York politics, toiling in her converted garage on Long Island's South Shore as a campaign bookkeeper to dozens of congressmen, judges and political action committees.
Battling for self-preservation, Mr. Santos has sought to blame Ms. Marks for his financial troubles, telling a conservative news outlet that "the former fiduciary went rogue." Ms. Marks, in turn, has told at least two associates in recent months that she, like others, was duped by Mr. Santos. In late January, amid growing interest from the Federal Election Commission about financial irregularities, she resigned.
It will be up to investigators to determine whether Ms. Marks, 57, participated in any impropriety. But a review by The New York Times -- including dozens of interviews and scrutiny of hundreds of pages of legal and campaign records -- shows that even as her stature grew over two decades, Ms. Marks waded into ethically and legally murky territory.
A relentless entrepreneur, Ms. Marks worked her way into Republican favor, expanding her business with big-name clients like the former congressman Lee Zeldin. She became a civic leader, serving on the board of the local library and, in January, received honors from a local charity.
But while the kind of egregious irregularities in Mr. Santos's reports do not appear in other campaigns she worked on, The Times found that Ms. Marks's accounting and business practices repeatedly drew suspicion. Former clients have taken her to court, saying she overpaid herself or failed to pay bills, as have a long line of creditors. Her close business ties with a felon alienated some onetime allies.
And in at least two previously unreported instances, her actions have attracted scrutiny from the U.S. attorney's office for New York's Eastern District, according to several people with direct knowledge of the inquiries. In one, prosecutors investigated allegations that Ms. Marks attempted to help broker the sale of a ballot line; in another, authorities scrutinized whether she had embezzled money from clients. She was never charged.
Ms. Marks did not respond to calls and texts seeking comment. Her lawyer, Ray Perini, a former candidate for district attorney who used Ms. Marks as his treasurer during his campaign, did not answer a detailed list of questions about her record, including whether she was cooperating with the investigations into Mr. Santos.
The U.S. attorney's office declined to comment, as did a lawyer for Mr. Santos, who said it would be "inappropriate" to do so given ongoing investigations.
Prosecutors are almost certainly more interested in Mr. Santos, who recently announced his intention to seek re-election in 2024. But campaign finance experts said that Ms. Marks could face her own criminal charges if she willfully misled the F.E.C. or covered up improper behavior.
"There are very fundamental errors that no accountant of her experience would make," said Brett G. Kappel, an elections lawyer who advises both political parties. "If she submitted these knowing they contained false information, there are going to be consequences."
A one-stop shop for candidates
Political campaigns are legally required to have a treasurer to oversee records of how money is raised and spent for state and federal authorities. The administrative role often falls to a family member or friend, especially for first-time candidates.
Ms. Marks realized years ago that there was a niche for someone like her to professionalize the position. State records show she does not have a C.P.A. license, but she taught herself election law and used connections forged as a low-level Suffolk County employee and political volunteer to become a one-stop shop for candidates' needs.
She formed businesses like GMG Print and Marketing Resources and Campaigns Unlimited to handle everything from lawn signs and palm cards to fund-raising and bookkeeping. They all operated under her home address in Shirley, N.Y., where a statue of the Virgin Mary stood watch.
In an industry dominated by slick consultants, some clients relished the unvarnished, mom-and-pop quality of her business. Visitors described middle-aged workers running big piles of checks through auto scanners as they smoked cigarettes and drank Diet Cokes.
"She was lovely. Easy to work with. Knew what she was doing," said David Catalfamo, a veteran Republican consultant who worked with Ms. Marks on Vito Fossella's 2021 campaign for Staten Island borough president. "In the world of crazies in politics, she was normal."
But Ms. Marks's eagerness to assume greater responsibility rankled other political operatives, who said she tried to take on work she had not been hired or asked to do. Others said she appeared in recent years to have taken on more accounts than she could handle, leading to sloppy or rushed work.
By then, she had become the go-to treasurer in Suffolk County for the right. Among scores of clients were Mr. Zeldin, who ran for governor in 2022; John Flanagan, a state senator and former majority leader; and conservative political action committees like God, Guns, Life; Veterans for MAGA; and the 1776 Project, which works to elect school board members who oppose teaching children about the history of race.
Altogether, Ms. Marks's businesses took in at least $ 3.3 million in political spending between 2009 and 2022, city, state and federal records show.
Roughly 10 percent of that came from one candidate, John Cummings, a Republican who raised $ 11 million in his unsuccessful 2020 campaign to unseat Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Mr. Cummings paid Campaigns Unlimited more than $ 90,000 for accounting, compliance, thank you notes and special projects. He spent another $ 250,000 on Ms. Marks's printing and consulting operations, for a total of $ 340,000 -- just over half coming after he lost.
Mr. Cummings did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Santos was also a lucrative account. Between his campaign, and associated PACs and committees, he paid Ms. Marks and her companies nearly $ 240,000, including reimbursements.
Far from becoming rich, though, Ms. Marks repeatedly found herself in debt.
Unpaid credit card bills led to a spate of judgments, and unpaid taxes threatened the handful of modest homes her family bought near the Canadian border. In 2014, Ms. Marks's husband, Peter, was diagnosed with cancer, according to a GoFundMe page to support the family. More unpaid bills piled up.
In 2017, Chase Bank moved to foreclose on the Shirley home. Mr. Marks, a former corrections officer, died in 2019. The foreclosure dispute is ongoing.
'Nancy is a hustler'
Even as her business grew, Ms. Marks increasingly gave other Republicans reasons to question her judgment.
Many of the cases trace back to Fred Towle Jr., a former Suffolk County legislator for whom Ms. Marks worked as an aide and campaign treasurer. Mr. Towle pleaded guilty in 2003 to political corruption charges. Ms. Marks cooperated with the investigation, according to a report in Newsday, and was never charged. When other Republicans distanced themselves from Mr. Towle after he got out of jail, though, she kept working with him.
Their association came under scrutiny after a meeting they held with Tara Scully, a Republican judicial candidate in Suffolk County in the fall of 2015. At the time, Ms. Scully was looking for support from the local Conservative Party, which would come with a coveted ballot line that could improve her chances of winning.
At the meeting, details of which were first reported by Newsday in 2016, Mr. Towle said he could use his relationship with the Conservative Party chairman to help Ms. Scully secure the endorsement if she paid him a large consulting fee. He also suggested she donate $ 2,000 to the Conservative Party. As an added layer of caution, the pair offered to route the payment through Ms. Marks's Campaigns Unlimited.
The offer caught the attention of local and federal prosecutors, who at the time were preparing to put the Conservative Party chairman on trial on charges of defrauding taxpayers. Ms. Scully's team told them they believed Mr. Towle and Ms. Marks had dangled a blatant -- and corrupt -- quid pro quo. The two denied that interpretation.
Subpoenas were issued. Witnesses surreptitiously recorded each other. But prosecutors concluded they could not clearly establish bribery or extortion, according to four people familiar with the case who described it on the condition of anonymity. Prosecutors declined to bring charges.
Mr. Towle later entered a guilty plea for unrelated tax charges. His lawyer, J. Bruce Maffeo, said this week that the matter involving Ms. Scully had been "thoroughly investigated by the U.S. attorney's office, and they declined to bring charges."
Ms. Marks's work left other clients feeling uneasy.
Peter Zinno turned to Ms. Marks for help with his run for a House seat on Long Island in 2010. He recalled her offering to charge him half of her usual rate because, he said, "She liked me, apparently."
But after he failed to win the Republican nomination, he discovered that during his campaign, Ms. Marks had doubled the monthly rate paid to her company without notice. Some months she appeared to bill him twice.
Mr. Zinno sued Ms. Marks in 2013 for $ 3,800, but lost his case when a judge said he lacked sufficient evidence, in part because he had waited too long to lodge his claim.
"Nancy is a hustler," Mr. Zinno said in an interview. "And I got taken."
Mr. Zinno's experience appears similar to conduct that prompted a second pass at Ms. Marks's business by federal investigators.
In that inquiry, investigators came to suspect that Ms. Marks might have been playing tricks with the books she kept. They confronted at least one of her clients with evidence that she used her position as treasurer to overpay herself, according to the client, who insisted on anonymity, and another official familiar with the matter.
It is unclear what prompted the outreach or if it was connected to a broader inquiry. The inquiry again ended without charges.
'Her George'
Ms. Marks doted on many of her clients -- offering encouragement regardless of how bad the polls looked. But in recent years, George Santos stood apart.
"She thought of George as her favorite client," said Michael Rendino, the Bronx Republican Party chairman, who briefly hired Ms. Marks for his own race. "She had, I thought, a motherly love for him. That was 'her George."'
The relationship was mutually beneficial. Ms. Marks offered Mr. Santos decades of experience and relationships with key Republicans. Mr. Santos offered Ms. Marks a chance to expand her business, inviting her to join staff phone calls and accompany him on fund-raising trips out of state.
All the while, she filed reports with suspicious patterns of spending. There were payments to cleaning companies described as "rent"; $ 365,399.08 in spending that the campaign never explained; and nearly $ 800,000 in loans he made to his campaign over the years that raised questions about the source of his income.
And then there were the $ 199.99 payments to "anonymous" -- totaling nearly $ 250,000 at one point -- that have drawn the scrutiny of the F.E.C.
Mr. Santos is not the only client whose filings have drawn scrutiny. In late March, Mr. Zeldin amended years-old reports to clear up 21 payments of $ 199.99 to unnamed recipients during his 2020 House campaign. A review of his congressional filings shows that the Zeldin campaign also reported $ 110,000 in nonitemized spending that year, more than any sitting New York House member, apart from Mr. Santos.
Earlier this month, the F.E.C. wrote to Ms. Marks ordering Mr. Zeldin to refund $ 129,000 in contributions he collected improperly in 2021 and 2022 and then transferred to his campaign for governor.
"It shows a certain level of disregard for the rules," said Saurav Ghosh, a former F.E.C. enforcement lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center.
The Zeldin campaign reviewed its filings in response to a request from The Times and found no issues, the former campaign manager, Eric Amidon, said. He added that he believed the F.E.C. to be mistaken about the contributions, but said that they would be refunded out of an abundance of caution.
The degree to which Ms. Marks was aware of Mr. Santos's numerous biographical deceptions is not clear. But Florida corporate records show she went into business with him and some of his colleagues from Harbor City Capitol, a Florida-based investment company, just weeks after the Securities and Exchange Commission had shut the company down over concerns it operated as a Ponzi scheme.
In May 2021, Red Strategies USA was born.
Like Ms. Marks's Campaigns Unlimited, the venture promised candidates convenience: one place to produce and place ads, manage social media and provide general political consulting.
Jordan Hafizi, a first-time candidate, turned to Red Strategies for help on a 2021 City Council race, paying the firm $ 22,450 to produce and promote a campaign video on social media, according to public campaign filings and a contract agreement reviewed by The Times.
But a review of the repository of ads on Meta, the company that owns Facebook, as well as a review by the ad tracking firm AdImpact, shows that only four Facebook ads were purchased on Mr. Hafizi's behalf, and those were removed because they did not include a required disclaimer. The placements cost $ 3,800, though Mr. Hafizi paid Red Strategies $ 12,000, according to a person with direct knowledge of the arrangement.
Red Strategies was not the only company Mr. Hafizi patronized that was tied to Ms. Marks, who was also his treasurer. All told, Mr. Hafizi, who failed to garner the nomination in his City Council race, spent nearly $ 50,000 with Ms. Marks's companies -- roughly 60 percent of his campaign's total spending, New York City campaign finance records show. He declined to comment.
As for Red Strategies, the company barely got off the ground: It handled just a few accounts, and was dissolved by the State of Florida in September 2022 for failing to file an annual report. By then, Ms. Marks and Mr. Santos were just a few weeks from an unlikely upset victory that would alter the course of their careers.

Slight Gains in Markets After Quiet Week: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Stocks capped a listless day of trading Friday with slight gains for the major stock indexes, closing out a quiet week on Wall Street highlighted by a batch of mostly mixed corporate earnings reports.
The S&P 500, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite all gained 0.1 percent after drifting between small gains and losses for most of the day. The indexes each posted a slight loss for the week.
Health care companies and a range of consumer product makers gained ground, tempering losses in banks, technology stocks and elsewhere. Truist Financial and KeyCorp, two of the larger regional banks, were among the biggest decliners in the S&P 500. Truist fell 6 percent and KeyCorp ended 3.7 percent lower.
Bond yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates and other loans, rose to 3.56 percent from 3.54 percent late Thursday.
Trading was muted as investors focused on the latest corporate earnings reports and forecasts in a bid to get a better sense of how companies are handling high inflation, a slowing economy and fears about a recession.
"You have a market that's in waiting mode," said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. "It's waiting for a sense of what we're going to hear from companies."
Investors reviewed a handful of earnings reports Friday. Hospital operator HCA Healthcare rose 3.9 percent after the company topped estimates for the first quarter and raised its full-year profit forecast. Procter & Gamble, the maker of Charmin toilet paper and other popular consumer products, rose 3.5 percent after beating estimates thanks to price increases.
Information technology services company PC Connection fell 4.9 percent after giving investors a disappointing financial update. Regional bank Regions Financial fell 2.8 percent after reporting discouraging earnings.
Companies have so far been beating Wall Street forecasts this earnings period. Analysts had forecast this would mark the sharpest drop in S&P 500 earnings per share since the pandemic stunned the economy in 2020. Analysts polled by FactSet expect profits to contract by 6.3 percent for companies in the S&P 500.
Several big companies are on deck to report earnings next week, giving investors another heavy few days of corporate updates. Coca-Cola reports its latest results on Monday, followed by McDonald's and Alphabet on Tuesday.
Boeing and Facebook's parent, Meta Platforms, will report results on Wednesday. Investors will get more details on the health of the airline industry when American Airlines and Southwest Airlines report financial results on Thursday, along with internet retail giant Amazon.
The busy week of earnings reports could help provide more direction for investors as recession worries linger, Dr. Krosby said.
"There's a tug of war between what the economic data is saying and the message from equity markets," she said.
The latest earnings come as investors worry about the potential for a recession amid the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation. The central bank aggressively raised interest rates through 2022 and into 2023. The rate hikes have weighed on economic growth and while inflation has eased it remains high and is still squeezing consumers.
The Fed will meet again in early May and is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by another quarter point. Wall Street is betting that the Fed will take a break from raising interest rates after that meeting.
The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, rose to 4.17 percent from 4.16 percent late Thursday.
Wall Street is anticipating more economic data next week that could provide greater insight into inflation's impact and the economy's path. The reports will included consumer confidence for April, first-quarter gross domestic product and another government update on prices and inflation.
All told, the S&P 500 rose 3.73 points to 4,133.52. The Dow added 22.34 points to close at 33,808.96. The Nasdaq rose 12.90 points to 12,072.46. Decliners held a slight edge over gainers on the New York Stock Exchange.
Markets in Europe also ended with small gains Friday, while exchanges in Asia declined overnight.

A Former Aide to Santos Had Also Traveled a Murky Path

Full text: Enlarge this image.
When George Santos was a political neophyte struggling to launch his first bid for Congress in the suburbs of New York City, he made a consequential early hire.
He brought on Nancy Marks, a fixture in Long Island Republican circles, to serve as campaign treasurer. Over the next three years, she used her deep ties to local Republicans and her stable of businesses to become indispensable to the campaign and to Santos.
She helped him meet donors and signed off on nearly every campaign invoice and financial filing. In May 2021, records show, the two even briefly went into business together as political consultants.
Now, as federal and local prosecutors examine the web of deceit Santos spun on his way to winning a closely contested House seat last November, they appear to be focused on a trail of financial dealings that suggests possible campaign finance violations or outright fraud. Campaign filings listed donations that exceeded the legal limit, hundreds of thousands of dollars in unexplained spending and a strange string of expenses for $199.99 — just pennies below the threshold beyond which receipts are required.
No one may be more central to that inquiry than Marks, who was, until now, an unheralded cog in New York politics, toiling in her converted garage on Long Island’s South Shore as a campaign bookkeeper to dozens of congressmen, judges and political action committees.
Battling for self-preservation, Santos has sought to blame Marks for his financial troubles, telling a conservative news outlet that “the former fiduciary went rogue.” Marks, in turn, has told at least two associates in recent months that she, like others, was duped by Santos. In late January, amid growing interest from the Federal Election Commission about financial irregularities, she resigned.
It will be up to investigators to determine whether Marks, 57, participated in any impropriety. But a review by The New York Times — including dozens of interviews and scrutiny of hundreds of pages of legal and campaign records — shows that even as her stature grew over two decades, Marks waded into ethically and legally murky territory.
A relentless entrepreneur, Marks worked her way into Republican favor, expanding her business with big-name clients like former Rep. Lee Zeldin. She became a civic leader, serving on the board of the local library and, in January, received honors from a local charity.
But while the kind of egregious irregularities in Santos’ reports do not appear in other campaigns she worked on, the Times found that Marks’ accounting and business practices repeatedly drew suspicion. Former clients have taken her to court, saying she overpaid herself or failed to pay bills, as have a long line of creditors. Her close business ties with a felon alienated some one-time allies.
And in at least two previously unreported instances, her actions have attracted scrutiny from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for New York’s Eastern District, according to several people with direct knowledge of the inquiries. In one, prosecutors investigated allegations that Marks attempted to help broker the sale of a ballot line; in another, authorities scrutinized whether she had embezzled money from clients. She was never charged.
Marks did not respond to calls and texts seeking comment. Her lawyer, Ray Perini, a former candidate for district attorney who used Marks as his treasurer during his campaign, did not answer a detailed list of questions about her record, including whether she was cooperating with the investigations into Santos.
The U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment, as did a lawyer for Santos, who said it would be “inappropriate” to do so given ongoing investigations.
Prosecutors are almost certainly more interested in Santos, who recently announced his intention to seek reelection in 2024. But campaign finance experts said that Marks could face her own criminal charges if she willfully misled the FEC or covered up improper behavior.
“There are very fundamental errors that no accountant of her experience would make,” said Brett G. Kappel, an elections lawyer who advises both political parties. “If she submitted these knowing they contained false information, there are going to be consequences.”
A one-stop shop for candidates
Political campaigns are legally required to have a treasurer to oversee records of how money is raised and spent for state and federal authorities. The administrative role often falls to a family member or friend, especially for first-time candidates.
Marks realized years ago that there was a niche for someone like her to professionalize the position. State records show she does not have a CPA license, but she taught herself election law and used connections forged as a low-level Suffolk County employee and political volunteer to become a one-stop shop for candidates’ needs.
She formed businesses like GMG Print and Marketing Resources and Campaigns Unlimited to handle everything from lawn signs and palm cards to fundraising and bookkeeping. They all operated under her home address in Shirley, New York, where a statue of the Virgin Mary stood watch.
In an industry dominated by slick consultants, some clients relished the unvarnished, mom-and-pop quality of her business. Visitors described middle-aged workers running big piles of checks through auto scanners as they smoked cigarettes and drank Diet Cokes.
“She was lovely. Easy to work with. Knew what she was doing,” said David Catalfamo, a veteran Republican consultant who worked with Marks on Vito Fossella’s 2021 campaign for Staten Island borough president. “In the world of crazies in politics, she was normal.”
But Marks’ eagerness to assume greater responsibility rankled other political operatives, who said she tried to take on work she had not been hired or asked to do. Others said she appeared in recent years to have taken on more accounts than she could handle, leading to sloppy or rushed work.
By then, she had become the go-to treasurer in Suffolk County for the right. Among scores of clients were Zeldin, who ran for governor in 2022; John Flanagan, a state senator and former majority leader; and conservative political action committees like God, Guns, Life; Veterans for MAGA; and the 1776 Project, which works to elect school board members who oppose teaching children about the history of race.
Altogether, Marks’ businesses took in at least $3.3 million in political spending between 2009 and 2022, city, state and federal records show.
Roughly 10% of that came from one candidate, John Cummings, a Republican who raised $11 million in his unsuccessful 2020 campaign to unseat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Cummings paid Campaigns Unlimited more than $90,000 for accounting, compliance, thank-you notes and special projects. He spent another $250,000 on Marks’ printing and consulting operations, for a total of $340,000 — just over half coming after he lost.
Cummings did not respond to a request for comment.
Santos was also a lucrative account. Between his campaign, and associated PACs and committees, he paid Marks and her companies nearly $240,000, including reimbursements.
Far from becoming rich, though, Marks repeatedly found herself in debt.
Unpaid credit card bills led to a spate of judgments, and unpaid taxes threatened the handful of modest homes her family bought near the Canadian border. In 2014, Marks’ husband, Peter, was diagnosed with cancer, according to a GoFundMe page to support the family. More unpaid bills piled up.
In 2017, Chase Bank moved to foreclose on the Shirley home. Marks, a former corrections officer, died in 2019. The foreclosure dispute is ongoing.
‘Nancy is a hustler’
Even as her business grew, Marks increasingly gave other Republicans reasons to question her judgment.
Many of the cases trace back to Fred Towle Jr., a former Suffolk County legislator for whom Marks worked as an aide and campaign treasurer. Towle pleaded guilty in 2003 to political corruption charges. Marks cooperated with the investigation, according to a report in Newsday, and was never charged. When other Republicans distanced themselves from Towle after he got out of jail, though, she kept working with him.
Their association came under scrutiny after a meeting they held with Tara Scully, a Republican judicial candidate in Suffolk County in the fall of 2015. At the time, Scully was looking for support from the local Conservative Party, which would come with a coveted ballot line that could improve her chances of winning.
At the meeting, details of which were first reported by Newsday in 2016, Towle said he could use his relationship with the Conservative Party chair to help Scully secure the endorsement if she paid him a large consulting fee. He also suggested she donate $2,000 to the Conservative Party. As an added layer of caution, the pair offered to route the payment through Marks’ Campaigns Unlimited.
The offer caught the attention of local and federal prosecutors, who at the time were preparing to put the Conservative Party chair on trial on charges of defrauding taxpayers. Scully’s team told them they believed Towle and Marks had dangled a blatant — and corrupt — quid pro quo. The two denied that interpretation.
Subpoenas were issued. Witnesses surreptitiously recorded each other. But prosecutors concluded they could not clearly establish bribery or extortion, according to four people familiar with the case who described it on the condition of anonymity. Prosecutors declined to bring charges.
Towle later entered a guilty plea for unrelated tax charges. His lawyer, J. Bruce Maffeo, said this week that the matter involving Scully had been “thoroughly investigated by the U.S. attorney’s office, and they declined to bring charges.”
Marks’ work left other clients feeling uneasy.
Peter Zinno turned to Marks for help with his run for a House seat on Long Island in 2010. He recalled her offering to charge him half of her usual rate because, he said, “She liked me, apparently.”
But after he failed to win the Republican nomination, he discovered that during his campaign, Marks had doubled the monthly rate paid to her company without notice. Some months she appeared to bill him twice.
Zinno sued Marks in 2013 for $3,800, but lost his case when a judge said he lacked sufficient evidence, in part because he had waited too long to lodge his claim.
“Nancy is a hustler,” Zinno said in an interview. “And I got taken.”
Zinno’s experience appears similar to conduct that prompted a second pass at Marks’ business by federal investigators.
In that inquiry, investigators came to suspect that Marks might have been playing tricks with the books she kept. They confronted at least one of her clients with evidence that she used her position as treasurer to overpay herself, according to the client, who insisted on anonymity, and another official familiar with the matter.
It is unclear what prompted the outreach or if it was connected to a broader inquiry. The inquiry again ended without charges.
‘Her George’
Marks doted on many of her clients — offering encouragement regardless of how bad the polls looked. But in recent years, George Santos stood apart.
“She thought of George as her favorite client,” said Michael Rendino, the Bronx Republican Party chairman, who briefly hired Marks for his own race. “She had, I thought, a motherly love for him. That was ‘her George.’”
The relationship was mutually beneficial. Marks offered Santos decades of experience and relationships with key Republicans. Santos offered Marks a chance to expand her business, inviting her to join staff phone calls and accompany him on fundraising trips out of state.
All the while, she filed reports with suspicious patterns of spending. There were payments to cleaning companies described as “rent”; $365,399.08 in spending that the campaign never explained; and nearly $800,000 in loans he made to his campaign over the years that raised questions about the source of his income.
And then there were the $199.99 payments to “anonymous” — totaling nearly $250,000 at one point — that have drawn the scrutiny of the FEC.
Santos is not the only client whose filings have drawn scrutiny. In late March, Zeldin amended years-old reports to clear up 21 payments of $199.99 to unnamed recipients during his 2020 House campaign. A review of his congressional filings shows that the Zeldin campaign also reported $110,000 in nonitemized spending that year, more than any sitting New York House member, apart from Santos.
This month, the FEC wrote to Marks ordering Zeldin to refund $129,000 in contributions he collected improperly in 2021 and 2022 and then transferred to his campaign for governor.
“It shows a certain level of disregard for the rules,” said Saurav Ghosh, a former FEC enforcement lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center.
The Zeldin campaign reviewed its filings in response to a request from the Times and found no issues, the former campaign manager, Eric Amidon, said. He added that he believed the FEC to be mistaken about the contributions, but said that they would be refunded out of an abundance of caution.
The degree to which Marks was aware of Santos’ numerous biographical deceptions is not clear. But Florida corporate records show she went into business with him and some of his colleagues from Harbor City Capitol, a Florida-based investment company, just weeks after the Securities and Exchange Commission had shut the company down over concerns it operated as a Ponzi scheme.
In May 2021, Red Strategies USA was born.
Like Marks’ Campaigns Unlimited, the venture promised candidates convenience: one place to produce and place ads, manage social media and provide general political consulting.
Jordan Hafizi, a first-time candidate, turned to Red Strategies for help on a 2021 City Council race, paying the firm $22,450 to produce and promote a campaign video on social media, according to public campaign filings and a contract agreement reviewed by the Times.
But a review of the repository of ads on Meta, the company that owns Facebook, as well as a review by the ad tracking firm AdImpact, shows that only four Facebook ads were purchased on Hafizi’s behalf, and those were removed because they did not include a required disclaimer. The placements cost $3,800, though Hafizi paid Red Strategies $12,000, according to a person with direct knowledge of the arrangement.
Red Strategies was not the only company Hafizi patronized that was tied to Marks, who was also his treasurer. All told, Hafizi, who failed to garner the nomination in his City Council race, spent nearly $50,000 with Marks’ companies — roughly 60% of his campaign’s total spending, New York City campaign finance records show. He declined to comment.
As for Red Strategies, the company barely got off the ground: It handled just a few accounts, and was dissolved by the state of Florida in September 2022 for failing to file an annual report. By then, Marks and Santos were just a few weeks from an unlikely upset victory that would alter the course of their careers.

Apple Opens Its First Store Within India: [Correction]

Full text: Tim Cook, the chief executive of the iPhone maker, visited Mumbai to inaugurate the store. Apple is pushing to expand its market share in India, as well as shift some production there.
Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, visited India this week to open the company's first two Apple stores there: The biggest public company in the world is finally opening its first retail outlets in the world's most populous country.
Roaring crowds of would-be customers greeted him in Mumbai on Tuesday at a sleek glass-and-timber flatiron of a storefront, called Apple BKC, in the Bandra Kurla Complex. On Thursday, Mr. Cook will travel to New Delhi to open a second store, Apple Saket, at the center of the capital's biggest mall.
The Apple brand is not new to India. But for the past 25 years -- marked this week, in fact -- Apple has relied solely on third-party sellers to get its products into the hands of Indian consumers. The iPhone is still a rare sight within the ocean of cheaper, and mostly Chinese-branded, Android smartphones that have swept across India over the past decade. Yet in India, as in nearly every other part of the world, Apple has its fans. Some of the most ardent were at the Mumbai opening, screaming their support.
And in Delhi are eager customers like Amar Bhasin, 41, whose first cellphone, bought 18 years ago, was a Panasonic. More recently, he bought an iPad from an Indian outlet, only to discover that its screen was cracked. The store refused to exchange it, and local service centers weren't helpful. So Mr. Bhasin addressed a letter to Mr. Cook himself -- and a month later, a new iPad appeared in the mail.
"I felt so good, and became an Apple fan instantly -- who does that?" Mr. Bhasin said, standing before the still-shrouded Apple Saket. "I don't see myself buying another brand in the foreseeable future."
India is an important frontier for Apple. It was by far the biggest country to lack an outlet bearing its own brand. Some much smaller countries have multiple Apple stores: Switzerland has four, and even Macau, a Chinese territory with a population of 680,000, or 0.5 percent of India's, has two.
But those countries are something India is not: rich. Even the lower- to middle-income countries with Apple stores, such as Brazil, Thailand and Turkey, have per-capita incomes several times higher than India's.
In a potential market so big, Apple does not need to make much of a dent to earn back its investment. The company's market share in India has been growing rapidly. The iPhone 13 is the best-selling model in the premium segment, which includes phones that cost above 30,000 rupees, or $ 365. Last year, only 11 percent of the market was considered premium, but it was the fastest-growing segment.
The Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi sold the most phones in total, and the South Korean giant Samsung, which competes at different price points, had the highest value of sales, according to Counterpoint Research.
But Apple faces a consumer-pricing puzzle in India. Unlike a McDonald's, for example, Apple's signature products need to sell for roughly the same price everywhere (or else they would fly around the world, unlocked, on the black market). But the difference between marketing utility goods and luxury products becomes jumbled in the Indian context. In the Saket mall, called Select CityWalk, a bubble of air-conditioning and chromed shopfronts are across the road from a medieval warren; the Apple store is opposite a Krispy Kreme. Outposts of Chanel and Van Heusen are nearby.
Price hits differently in a country where the top 10 percent income bracket begins at 25,000 rupees, or $ 304, per month -- well under half the cost of a new iPhone. For many millions of wealthy Indians, that is perfectly acceptable. And even for those whom it stretches, it can be a price worth paying.
"It's simple: For me, it's a status symbol," said Subodh Sharma, who earns exactly 25,000 rupees per month working for a construction company. "The message that goes out to the peer and society is that, look, this person is not totally third-class," he said, glancing down at the iPhone tucked into his shirt pocket.
Mr. Sharma's partner, Bhawana, however, disagrees with his assessment. An iPhone is "not worth it," she said, right after Mr. Sharma took her photo in front of the store in Delhi. "It's uselessly costly, and its storage is small and battery life even worse." She prefers the Chinese-made Oppo phone she has been using for four years. (She earns 18,000 rupees per month at her job.)
Apple's formidable ecosystem is bound to spread more slowly in a place where the iPhone remains out of reach for so many. Kunal Dua, who runs a pharmaceutical business, recently converted his wife, Gagan Deep Kaur, to the iPhone -- but only halfway. She uses it for her Instagram account and other parts of her online social life, but she stays on her Android for work.
"Most people working under us come from lower-income groups and cannot afford an iPhone," Mr. Dua said. "So sharing media and files becomes difficult."
The relationship between Apple and India is evolving quickly. The part that matters most may have less to do with India's consumers than with the country's growing role as a production hub.
Last week, analysts at JPMorgan Chase published a report describing how a push to move manufacturing and supply chains away from China has been underway "since late 2018, led by geopolitical issues, then a pandemic and now geopolitical issues again rearing their ugly head." They expected a sustained shift and estimated that a quarter of Apple's products will be made outside China by 2025, versus less than 5 percent today, "with Vietnam and India slated as countries of choice."
That migration of high-end manufacturing might activate another ecosystem altogether. Apple is not just any multinational company. A report from Mirae Asset Financial Group said that "given Apple's size, it is a key player that can set standards and influence policy decisions," noting that the company has catalyzed China's growth. "We see a similar trend now occurring in India, as Apple diversifies its supply chain into India and a burgeoning local tech-manufacturing ecosystem develops."
Ultimately, new factories and entire new industries will need to be built before India can generate the kind of wealth necessary for more of its 1.4 billion potential consumers to become regular Apple customers.
During the store opening on Tuesday, Mr. Cook pressed his palms together in a gesture of namaste. Later that day on Twitter, he praised Mumbai for the city's "incredible energy, creativity, and passion."
His fans in India were already delighted to see more of his company in their country. They may now hope that even more multinational executives follow his lead.

Full text: And no, it's not because it stinks like rotten meat. (Just for the record, they don't all have a rancid smell.)
The first pineapple lily I grew was a real stinker -- and we have lived happily ever after together for more than 20 years.
Aside from the smell of rotting meat it emitted, Eucomis bicolor made such an impression -- visually, that is -- that I promptly ordered more. In each spring's bulb catalogs, I now search out other pineapple lilies as well, to grow in pots and then stash in my Northeastern cellar for a long winter's nap.
Over the years, I have developed a deep envy of gardeners in warmer places who can grow these Zone 7-ish bulbs, which are hyacinth relatives with origins in Southern Africa, as perennials.
No one stirs that feeling more than Augustus Jenkins Farmer III -- please, just Jenks -- in Beech Island, S.C. Pineapple lilies and other specialty bulbs are mainstays in the garden borders and exuberant, meadow-style designs he creates for clients, as they are at his home farm and in his mail-order nursery.
The signature bulb at Jenks Farmer, Plantsman is the genus Crinum, which is "like Amaryllis on steroids," he said. I have yet to try to convince one to put up with my climate constraints, but I'm tempted. Eucomis, though, Mr. Farmer and I have in common.
Lately, as gardeners with shared obsessions are inclined to do, we have been comparing notes. It turns out that we are both longtime frequent fliers on the Eucomis pages of the excellent Pacific Bulb Society Wiki website.
Each of our conversations has followed a sort of same-plant-different-experience theme. My creativity is confined to seasonal pots, while Mr. Farmer has to contend with the rigors of his Deep South climate, where the summer nights can be nearly as hot as the days, so he is ever seeking plants with appropriate mettle.
No matter our differing situations, what we love about our respective pineapple lilies is unanimous: Oh, those leaves.
"They give you that big, wide kind of tropical foliage effect all season," Mr. Farmer said.
And there are not just a couple of leaves, but enough strappy ones to encircle the emerging flower stem like a lush nest. The leaves can be green or purple, or even freckled with purple, animallike spots, as can the stems.
We love the summertime blooms, too, of course. The many tiny flowers are tightly arrayed around the upper portion of each stem and capped with a tousled topknot of leaflike bracts, making the inflorescence resemble a pineapple. That feature explains the plant's Latin name, Eucomis, from a Greek word for "good-haired."
"The cooler thing: When they go out of flower, they look more or less like they did in flower," Mr. Farmer said. "They maintain their structure and color, so you get a show for a really long time."
Most have no roadkill scent, in case that raises objections. E. bicolor's stench of sulfur compounds is an adaptation that attracts carrion flies as pollinators. Other species, pollinated by specialized wasps, smell perfectly pleasant -- the scent of coconut is sometimes mentioned -- and are marketed as dramatic, long-lasting cut flowers.
Sound good?
The 'Funky Little Flower Farm'
Mr. Farmer has been growing Eucomis for some 30 years, beginning when he was the curator at the Riverbanks Botanical Garden in West Columbia, S.C., and acquired seed from a source in South Africa to evaluate.
Say "Southern African bulb" and gardeners may assume that means the bulb is acclimated to hot, dry conditions. But many Eucomis are actually native to places that get abundant summer rainfall: grasslands, marshy spots, stream banks and seasonally wet areas known as vleis. (That clued me in to provide regular water when they are in active growth, especially in the confines of pots.)
These days, Mr. Farmer conducts on-farm bulb trials that are foundational to all aspects of his business -- garden design, mail-order sales and production growing of bulbs for clients' landscapes. Before he specifies a plant in a design, he needs to know it will perform well.
Although he referred to his farm as "Funky Little Flower Farm" in the title of his charming 2019 self-published memoir, it is a place of exacting horticultural standards.
It's also the family farm where he grew up. After his father died 15 years ago, Mr. Farmer made the decision to return home and save the farm by transforming it into a specialty bulb operation, which he runs today with his husband, Tom Hall.
Don't imagine a farm-like series of parallel nursery rows, though -- or at least not rows you can discern amid the delightful botanical effusion.
"In my garden design, I would say I'm very good at curves, and I'm terrible at straight lines," Mr. Farmer said. "I've resisted straight lines, because when I was little on the farm, my Dad was always like, 'Pull the string and make these straight lines."'
He knows it's the most efficient way to trial large numbers of plants, "but I can't stand to just have a row of one thing," he said. "So I have to interplant, and it just turns itself into a garden. My production beds are not like fields -- they're more like my garden."
Which Ones Work for You?
Our questions go back and forth: How do they do for you in partial shade, or do you grow them all in sun? (We both get away with either setting, but Mr. Farmer points out that full sun maximizes bulb production -- and also that purple-leaved cultivars won't achieve the best color in lower light.)
Do you fertilize them, we ask each other? (A resounding no from both lifelong organic gardeners.)
Mr. Farmer wants to know if I cut them back in midsummer. He does so around July with certain purple-leaved ones that have faded to brownish-green in his brutal summers. And then they send out another flush of fresh stuff, he said -- something I would never have expected a bulb to do.
Have I grown the littlest ones, he wonders, the ones derived from the species E. vandermerwei -- dwarf pineapple lilies that include Octopus and the Tiny Piny series that may reach around six inches high in flower?
And then he makes a small confession: "I don't know if I fail with them because they are not adapted to our climate or because they are tiny, and I tend to lose tiny plants." (In pots here, those little guys are happy, and easier to keep track of. I divide all of my Eucomis every other year and refresh the potting mix.)
More suitable for his designs are bulbs with some stature. Mr. Farmer favors Eucomis pallidiflora subspecies pole-evansii, which has greenish-white flowers that reach three feet high or taller.
The greenish-flowered hybrid Tugela Jade, at about 18 inches high, is another he promotes -- although green flowers are a hard sell. But if you surround them with purple or blue flowers, he noted, you may change your mind.
"Last year, we had it with bachelor button, and that cobalt blue and green were killer together," he said.
Maybe most delicious are Eucomis with purple foliage, a direction that Tony Avent, at Plant Delights Nursery, heralded in 1997 when he introduced Sparkling Burgundy, a cultivar of Eucomis comosa.
Rhode Island Red, introduced by Ed Bowen, of Issima Nursery, is a hybrid of E. comosa and pole-evansii with purple-green foliage and pink flowers. When I grow it, it approaches three feet.
Then there is the fashionable Coco, with dark burgundy leaves and pink flowers.
"Coco must be named for Coco Chanel and her comfortable black outfits," Mr. Farmer writes in his catalog description. "This bulb fits into any little spot. A wild garden, an overly planned color garden, it even works as a potted plant -- that you might brush off and bring inside for a dinner party."
And there is Reuben -- "a bright pinky-fuchsia," he said -- and John Treasure and ...
Uh-oh. You can see where this is leading: more Eucomis.
Making More Eucomis
It's hard to believe the makings of such emphatic beauty are hidden inside the rather unimpressive-looking, squat, flat-bottomed bulbs.
Likewise surprising: More Eucomis bulbs can be had by rooting leaf cuttings taken in midsummer. The process takes about three years to achieve flowering stage, but it's easy, Mr. Farmer said.
Water the plant well the day before, to hydrate the foliage. With a sharp blade, cut a leaf into two-inch cross sections. Dip each lower edge in rooting hormone powder before inserting it a half-inch deep into sand or another sharp-draining medium.
Important: Keep track of which side was down (and up); the cut edge that was pointed away from the bulb won't root.
"In a couple of weeks, you'll know if they're going to rot or root -- ones that aren't working just start to deteriorate," he said.
The successes will send down invisible white roots. Don't expect any top growth. The next year, if you unearth a cutting, you'll see tiny white bulbs the size of lentils with little roots that have formed below the soil line. By the end of that summer, they should be big enough to move into pots, or the garden.
Of course, now I must try this -- and maybe one of the more Northeastern-friendly of Mr. Farmer's diverse collection of Crinum lilies. If only I could limit that bulb experiment to a single kind.

Comedy
'Vintage Basement With Max & Nicky'
April 15 at 7 p.m. at Young Ethel's, 506 Fifth Avenue, Brooklyn; youngethels.com.
A comedy duo comprising identical twins often has a distinctive edge: the spectacle of doppelgängers either finishing each other's sentences or engaging in a war of contradiction. Max and Nicky Weinbach are more collaborative than combative, and they add another layer to their twin shtick by wearing matching suits and performing doo-wop and pop covers from the 1950s and '60s.
Each month, they maintain that dapper demeanor to host comedic acts for their variety show, "Vintage Basement." April's edition features the stand-up Jim Tews, who made his TV debut on FX's "Louie" and then turned his Tumblr blog into the 2015 New York Times best seller "Felines of New York"; Mike Hanford from "Comedy Bang! Bang!"; Clare O'Kane, a former writer on "Saturday Night Live"; and Rachel Green, who appeared on Kevin Hart's "Road Comics" in 2021.
Admission is free, but reservations are encouraged and can be made at Eventbrite. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
Black Belt Eagle Scout
April 15 at 8 p.m. at Baby's All Right, 146 Broadway, Brooklyn; babysallright.com.
In recorded music, the term "hearing the room" -- or detecting the traces of studio acoustics that make their way onto tape -- is a reminder that every song comes from a particular time and place. This sort of specificity is central to Katherine Paul's music, which she performs as Black Belt Eagle Scout -- though what's audible on her latest album is not so much the room as the land. Titled "The Land, the Water, the Sky," the record was inspired by the terrain of the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community in Washington State, where Paul grew up and where she returned to during the pandemic. Her lyrical explorations of romantic and familial love are anchored by the landmarks and lore of her ancestral homeland, while her foggy, guitar-forward palette evokes both the atmosphere and the alt-rock heritage of the Pacific Northwest.
On Saturday, Black Belt Eagle Scout will take the stage at Baby's All Right after a performance by Claire Glass and Adobo, two singer-songwriters who employ classical guitar techniques. Tickets are available for $ 18 from See Tickets. OLIVIA HORN
Matt Mitchell
April 14 at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. at the Jazz Gallery, 1158 Broadway, Fifth Floor, Manhattan; jazzgallery.org.
Many pianists still gravitate toward the time-tested trio, but for Matt Mitchell, the duo has become a central concern. Given his penchant for fractal-like complexity, the mind-meld nature of the format is a perfect fit. His new double album, "Oblong Aplomb," presents a pair of pairs -- 12 duets apiece with the percussionists Kate Gentile and Ches Smith, each of whom is a core Mitchell collaborator. Friday's record release concert will take the same shape, with Gentile performing the first set and Smith the second. The thrill of these encounters comes in hearing the pianist and his respective partners find an exhilarating freedom amid daunting rigor.
Tickets start at $ 30 for the general public and are available at the Jazz Gallery's website. A livestream option for each set is also available for $ 20 ( $ 5 for members). HANK SHTEAMER

114th Annual Salute to Magic
April 15 at 7 p.m. at the Playhouse Theater, Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, Manhattan; salutetomagic.com.
Magic is now so much more than pulling a rabbit out of a hat. How about capturing an invisible bee in a paper napkin that then floats, flies and buzzes? Or piercing a specific card with a sword as a full deck is hurtled through the air? Or transforming scarves into a cane, and vice versa?
These are just a few of the tricks in store on Saturday evening when the Society of American Magicians presents the 114th Annual Salute to Magic. This year's performers will include Chris Capehart, who aims to prove that metal can go through metal; Stoil and Ekaterina, known for their quick-change acts; Devlin, who can calmly swallow razor blades; Mark Mitton, whose favorite materials are the mats used to roll sushi; and the headliner Arthur Trace, a specialist in illusions with a storylike structure.
But young people may be most interested in one of their own: Amanda Nepo, a talented teenager who will demonstrate the card routine with which she successfully duped the hosts of the TV show "Penn & Teller: Fool Us" two years ago.
Tickets start at $ 30. LAUREL GRAEBER
Film
Tom Luddy: Film's Quiet Titan
April 13-16 at Paris Theater, 4 West 58th Street, Manhattan; paristheaternyc.com.
A founder of the Telluride Film Festival, Tom Luddy, who died in February, was known as one of the movie world's great connectors -- someone who nurtured filmmakers and helped them execute ideas. The Paris is presenting a weekend of movies associated with him, like Errol Morris's first feature, "Gates of Heaven" (showing on Friday, with Morris attending for a Q. and A.). Its completion required Werner Herzog to deliver on a bet: If Morris finished a film, Herzog had sworn that he would eat his shoes. So he dined on his footwear before a theater audience in Berkeley, Calif., in 1979, with Luddy as M.C. "Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe," Les Blank's short documentary that chronicles the event, will be shown with "Gates."
Luddy was also one of the producers of the Charles Bukowski-scripted "Barfly" (on Friday), starring Mickey Rourke as a habitually soused writer in Los Angeles; and had a hand in Jean-Luc Godard's "King Lear" (on Saturday), one of the director's greatest 1980s films (but not really a Shakespeare adaptation), featuring Molly Ringwald, Norman Mailer and, as "Professor Pluggy," Godard himself.

Can Intelligence Be Separated From the Body?: [Science Desk]

Full text: What is the relationship between mind and body?
Maybe the mind is like a video game controller, moving the body around the world, taking it on joy rides. Or maybe the body manipulates the mind with hunger, sleepiness and anxiety, something like a river steering a canoe. Is the mind like electromagnetic waves, flickering in and out of our light-bulb bodies? Or is the mind a car on the road? A ghost in the machine?
Maybe no metaphor will ever quite fit because there is no distinction between mind and body: There is just experience, or some kind of physical process, a gestalt.
These questions, agonized over by philosophers for centuries, are gaining new urgency as sophisticated machines with artificial intelligence begin to infiltrate society. Chatbots like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Bard have minds, in some sense: Trained on vast troves of human language, they have learned how to generate novel combinations of text, images and even videos. When primed in the right way, they can express desires, beliefs, hopes, intentions, love. They can speak of introspection and doubt, self-confidence and regret.
But some A.I. researchers say that the technology won't reach true intelligence, or true understanding of the world, until it is paired with a body that can perceive, react to and feel around its environment. For them, talk of disembodied intelligent minds is misguided -- even dangerous. A.I. that is unable to explore the world and learn its limits, in the ways that children figure out what they can and can't do, could make life-threatening mistakes and pursue its goals at the risk of human welfare.
"The body, in a very simple way, is the foundation for intelligent and cautious action," said Joshua Bongard, a roboticist at the University of Vermont. "As far as I can see, this is the only path to safe A.I."
At a lab in Pasadena, Calif., a small team of engineers has spent the past few years developing one of the first pairings of a large language model with a body: a turquoise robot named Moxie. About the size of a toddler, Moxie has a teardrop-shaped head, soft hands and alacritous green eyes. Inside its hard plastic body is a computer processor that runs the same kind of software as ChatGPT and GPT-4. Moxie's makers, part of a start-up called Embodied, describe the device as "the world's first A.I. robot friend."
The bot was conceived, in 2017, to help children with developmental disorders practice emotional awareness and communication skills. When someone speaks to Moxie, its processor converts the sound into text and feeds the text into a large language model, which in turn generates a verbal and physical response. Moxie's eyes can move to console you for the loss of your dog, and it can smile to pump you up for school. The robot also has sensors that take in visual cues and respond to your body language, mimicking and learning from the behavior of people around it.
"It's almost like this wireless communication between humans," said Paolo Pirjanian, a roboticist and the founder of Embodied. "You literally start feeling it in your body." Over time, he said, the robot gets better at this kind of give and take, like a friend getting to know you.
Researchers at Alphabet, Google's parent company, have taken a similar approach to integrating large language models with physical machines. In March, the company announced the success of a robot they called PaLM-E, which was able to absorb visual features of its environment and information about its own body position and translate it all into natural language. This allowed the robot to represent where it was in space relative to other things and eventually open a drawer and pick up a bag of chips.
Robots of this kind, experts say, will be able to perform basic tasks without special programming. They could ostensibly pour you a glass of Coke, make you lunch or pick you up from the floor after a bad tumble, all in response to a series of simple commands.
But many researchers doubt that the machines' minds, when structured in this modular way, will ever be truly connected to the physical world -- and, therefore, will never be able to display crucial aspects of human intelligence.
Boyuan Chen, a roboticist at Duke University who is working on developing intelligent robots, pointed out that the human mind -- or any other animal mind, for that matter -- is inextricable from the body's actions in and reactions to the real world, shaped over millions of years of evolution. Human babies learn to pick up objects long before they learn language.
The artificially intelligent robot's mind, in contrast, was built entirely on language, and often makes common-sense errors that stem from training procedures. It lacks a deeper connection between the physical and theoretical, Dr. Chen said. "I believe that intelligence can't be born without having the perspective of physical embodiments."
Dr. Bongard, of the University of Vermont, agreed. Over the past few decades, he has developed small robots made of frog cells, called xenobots, that can complete basic tasks and move around their environment. Although xenobots look much less impressive than chatbots that can write original haikus, they might actually be closer to the kind of intelligence we care about.
"Slapping a body onto a brain, that's not embodied intelligence," Dr. Bongard said. "It has to push against the world and observe the world pushing back."
He also believes that attempts to ground artificial intelligence in the physical world are safer than alternative research projects.
Some experts, including Dr. Pirjanian, recently conveyed concern in a letter about the possibility of creating A.I. that could disinterestedly steamroll humans in the pursuit of some goal (like efficiently producing paper clips), or that could be harnessed for nefarious purposes (like disinformation campaigns). The letter called for a temporary pause in the training of models more powerful than GPT-4.
Dr. Pirjanian noted that his own robot could be seen as a dangerous technology in this regard: "Imagine if you had a trusted companion robot that feels like part of the family, but is subtly brainwashing you," he said. To prevent this, his team of engineers trained another program to monitor Moxie's behavior and flag or prevent anything potentially harmful or confusing.
But any kind of guardrail to protect against these dangers will be difficult to build into large language models, especially as they grow more powerful. While many, like GPT-4, are trained with human feedback, which imbues them with certain limitations, the method can't account for every scenario, so the guardrails can be bypassed.
Dr. Bongard, as well as a number of other scientists in the field, thought that the letter calling for a pause in research could bring about uninformed alarmism. But he is concerned about the dangers of our ever improving technology and believes that the only way to suffuse embodied A.I. with a robust understanding of its own limitations is to rely on the constant trial and error of moving around in the real world.
Start with simple robots, he said, "and as they demonstrate that they can do stuff safely, then you let them have more arms, more legs, give them more tools."
And maybe, with the help of a body, a real artificial mind will emerge.

As A.I. Images Improve, Can We Believe Our Eyes?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Can We No Longer Believe Anything We See?
Seeing has not been believing for a very long time. Photos have been faked and manipulated for nearly as long as photography has existed.
Now, not even reality is required for photographs to look authentic -- just artificial intelligence responding to a prompt. Even experts sometimes struggle to tell if one is real or not. Can you?
The rapid advent of artificial intelligence has set off alarms that the technology used to trick people is advancing far faster than the technology that can identify the tricks. Tech companies, researchers, photo agencies and news organizations are scrambling to catch up, trying to establish standards for content provenance and ownership.
The advancements are already fueling disinformation and being used to stoke political divisions. Authoritarian governments have created seemingly realistic news broadcasters to advance their political goals. Last month, some people fell for images showing Pope Francis donning a puffy Balenciaga jacket and an earthquake devastating the Pacific Northwest, even though neither of those events had occurred. The images had been created using Midjourney, a popular image generator.
On Tuesday, as former President Donald J. Trump turned himself in at the Manhattan district attorney's office to face criminal charges, images generated by artificial intelligence appeared on Reddit showing the actor Bill Murray as president in the White House. Another image showing Mr. Trump marching in front of a large crowd with American flags in the background was quickly reshared on Twitter without the disclosure that had accompanied the original post, noting it was not actually a photograph.
Experts fear the technology could hasten an erosion of trust in media, in government and in society. If any image can be manufactured -- and manipulated -- how can we believe anything we see?
"The tools are going to get better, they're going to get cheaper, and there will come a day when nothing you see on the internet can be believed," said Wasim Khaled, chief executive of Blackbird.AI, a company that helps clients fight disinformation.
Artificial intelligence allows virtually anyone to create complex artworks, like those now on exhibit at the Gagosian art gallery in New York, or lifelike images that blur the line between what is real and what is fiction. Plug in a text description, and the technology can produce a related image -- no special skills required.
Often, there are hints that viral images were created by a computer rather than captured in real life: The luxuriously coated pope had glasses that seemed to melt into his cheek and blurry fingers, for example. A.I. art tools also often produce nonsensical text. Here are some examples:
Rapid advancements in the technology, however, are eliminating many of those flaws. Midjourney's latest version, released last month, is able to depict realistic hands, a feat that had, conspicuously, eluded early imaging tools.
Days before Mr. Trump turned himself in to face criminal charges in New York City, images made of his "arrest" coursed around social media.They were created by Eliot Higgins, a British journalist and founder of Bellingcat, an open source investigative organization. He used Midjourney to imagine the former president's arrest, trial, imprisonment in an orange jumpsuit and escape through a sewer. He posted the images on Twitter, clearly marking them as creations. They have since been widely shared.
The images weren't meant to fool anyone. Instead, Mr. Higgins wanted to draw attention to the tool's power -- even in its infancy.
Midjourney's images, he said, were able to pass muster in facial-recognition programs that Bellingcat uses to verify identities, typically of Russians who have committed crimes or other abuses. It's not hard to imagine governments or other nefarious actors manufacturing images to harass or discredit their enemies.
At the same time, Mr. Higgins said, the tool also struggled to create convincing images with people who are not as widely photographed as Mr. Trump, such as the new British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, or the comedian Harry Hill, "who probably isn't known outside of the U.K. that much."
Midjourney was not amused in any case. It suspended Mr. Higgins's account without explanation after the images spread. The company did not respond to requests for comment.
The limits of generative images make them relatively easy to detect by news organizations or others attuned to the risk -- at least for now.
Still, stock photo companies, government regulators and a music industry trade group have moved to protect their content from unauthorized use, but technology's powerful ability to mimic and adapt is complicating those efforts.
Some A.I. image generators have even reproduced images -- a queasy "Twin Peaks" homage; Will Smith eating fistfuls of pasta -- with distorted versions of the watermarks used by companies like Getty Images or Shutterstock.
In February, Getty accused Stability AI of illegally copying more than 12 million Getty photos, along with captions and metadata, to train the software behind its Stable Diffusion tool. In its lawsuit, Getty argued that Stable Diffusion diluted the value of the Getty watermark by incorporating it into images that ranged "from the bizarre to the grotesque."
Getty said the "brazen theft and freeriding" was conducted "on a staggering scale." Stability AI did not respond to a request for comment.
Getty's lawsuit reflects concerns raised by many individual artists -- that A.I. companies are becoming a competitive threat by copying content they do not have permission to use.
Trademark violations have also become a concern: Artificially generated images have replicated NBC's peacock logo, though with unintelligible letters, and shown Coca-Cola's familiar curvy logo with extra O's looped into the name.
In February, the U.S. Copyright Office weighed in on artificially generated images when it evaluated the case of "Zarya of the Dawn," an 18-page comic book written by Kristina Kashtanova with art generated by Midjourney. The government administrator decided to offer copyright protection to the comic book's text, but not to its art.
"Because of the significant distance between what a user may direct Midjourney to create and the visual material Midjourney actually produces, Midjourney users lack sufficient control over generated images to be treated as the 'master mind' behind them," the office explained in its decision.
The threat to photographers is fast outpacing the development of legal protections, said Mickey H. Osterreicher, general counsel for the National Press Photographers Association. Newsrooms will increasingly struggle to authenticate content. Social media users are ignoring labels that clearly identify images as artificially generated, choosing to believe they are real photographs, he said.
Generative A.I. could also make fake videos easier to produce. This week, a video appeared online that seemed to show Nina Schick, an author and a generative A.I. expert, explaining how the technology was creating "a world where shadows are mistaken for the real thing." Ms. Schick's face then glitched as the camera pulled back, showing a body double in her place.
The video explained that the deepfake had been created, with Ms. Schick's consent, by the Dutch company Revel.ai and Truepic, a California company that is exploring broader digital content verification.
The companies described their video, which features a stamp identifying it as computer-generated, as the "first digitally transparent deepfake." The data is cryptographically sealed into the file; tampering with the image breaks the digital signature and prevents the credentials from appearing when using trusted software.
The companies hope the badge, which will come with a fee for commercial clients, will be adopted by other content creators to help create a standard of trust involving A.I. images.
"The scale of this problem is going to accelerate so rapidly that it's going to drive consumer education very quickly," said Jeff McGregor, chief executive of Truepic.
Truepic is part of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, a project set up through an alliance with companies such as Adobe, Intel and Microsoft to better trace the origins of digital media. The chip-maker Nvidia said last month that it was working with Getty to help train "responsible" A.I. models using Getty's licensed content, with royalties paid to artists.
On the same day, Adobe unveiled its own image-generating product, Firefly, which will be trained using only images that were licensed or from its own stock or no longer under copyright. Dana Rao, the company's chief trust officer, said on its website that the tool would automatically add content credentials -- "like a nutrition label for imaging" -- that identified how an image had been made. Adobe said it also planned to compensate contributors.
Last month, the model Chrissy Teigen wrote on Twitter that she had been hoodwinked by the pope's puffy jacket, adding that "no way am I surviving the future of technology."
Last week, a series of new A.I. images showed the pope, back in his usual robe, enjoying a tall glass of beer. The hands appeared mostly normal -- save for the wedding band on the pontiff's ring finger.

Photograph An A.I.-generated image of a staged moon landing appears convincing enough at first glance, but closer inspection finds inhuman anomalies -- indistinct or smudged faces, for example -- in this early generation of the technology. However, improvements to the generative technology are already coming fast. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY A.I.: JORDAN RHONE); An A.I.-generated image of the former British prime minister Boris Johnson dancing in the street contains a telltale A.I. anomaly: strange hands and fingers. But the latest version of Midjourney, a popular image generator, can depict realistic hands, a feat that had eluded early imaging tools. (PHOTOGRAPH BY A.I.); In a lawsuit, Getty Images argued that Stability AI illegally copied more than 12 million Getty photographs, like that at left, to train its Stable Diffusion tool, and that it diluted the value of the Getty watermark by incorporating it into images that ranged "from the bizarre to the grotesque," like that at right.

Full text: I have spent the past few decades collecting what I consider to be a stylish wardrobe -- much of which is black. While I love black's versatility, I am starting to feel like I am in a rut, and would like to break out a bit. What can I do to change up my cherished uniform?
Sarah, New York City As someone who has likewise spent a lot of her life wearing black, I understand.
Black is one of those colors that contains within it multitudes. There's the black of Johnny Cash, the Man in Black. The black capris and T-shirt of Audrey Hepburn doing her weird modern dance in "Funny Face," and the long black Givenchy of Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's." The shredded, dancing-on-the-moors black of Stevie Nicks, and the black of Macbeth's witches.
There's the black that makes you think of the little black dress, which is always safe and elegant, and the black of the Beats, subversive and rebellious. There's sexy black and somber black and scary black. Also: mysterious black, because which one of the above are you? And: seductive black, because it allows you to choose among so many possible personas. Renoir called it "the queen of all colors." Dior called it "essential to a woman's wardrobe."
But, as with any defining choice, black can start to feel limiting; like a cliché or default, rather than a declaration of self. The problem is, when you have built your identity around one set of associations -- and have invested a fair amount of energy and your budget in it -- how do you expand your horizons without losing the core of your self or upending your wardrobe, neither of which are sustainable or practical?
Slowly. You'd be amazed how much small details make a difference.
Karla Welch, the stylist who works with Tracee Ellis Ross and Sarah Paulson and has a styling app, Wishi, says that a bright red lipstick or colored socks could make a difference. If magenta, the Pantone color of the year for 2023, seems like a step too far, add some T-shirts in basic shades like white. (As Coco Chanel said, "Black has it all. White, too. Their beauty is absolute. It is the perfect harmony.") But try camel, too, or even silver or jewel tones.
TikTok actually has a term for this: sandwich dressing. The idea being to pick a garment in what Ms. Welch calls "an accent color," and then (yes) sandwich it with black. For example, a T-shirt in blue under a black jacket with black pants. Or a beige skirt with a black top and black boots.
The net effect will still be mostly black -- it won't shock everyone who knows you -- but leavened with a bit of contrast. It's like inserting a tiny wedge in a wall that then expands over time to create a much larger space. And maybe a sense of possibility.

Brides Say 'Yes' to Vintage Dresses: [Style Desk]

Full text: With vintage fashion in high demand, the hunt for archival designer wedding dresses is becoming serious business.
One of the most intimate questions you can ask eBay power users is to show you their negotiations -- the private DMs they exchange with sellers bargaining over the price of an item. But Alexis Novak humored me.
The item was a spring 2018 dress from the French luxury brand Céline, then under the creative direction of Phoebe Philo, a designer whose cult following is almost unparalleled in modern fashion. The gown, with long sleeves and a turtleneck and glazed in white sequins, was listed at $ 8,000. Ms. Novak offered $ 6,000. The seller politely declined.
Ms. Novak, 32, didn't push back. She knew her limits. As the founder of Tab Vintage in Los Angeles, she is among the generation of archival fashion collectors helping to change the way celebrities dress. Which means she is experienced in sourcing pieces from auctions, estate sales, resale websites and other dealers -- pieces like the Thierry Mugler dresses worn last year by Kourtney Kardashian Barker to the Oscars, and Dua Lipa to her Ibiza birthday party.
But the Céline dress was different. Ms. Novak didn't intend to add it to her archive for someone else to wear on a red carpet. She collects Ms. Philo's work, and from the moment she had seen the white gown in runway photos in late 2017, she had thought: "That is my dream wedding dress. That is the chicest, coolest dress I've ever seen."
Five years later -- and now engaged to James Valentine, the guitarist for Maroon 5 -- that eBay listing was only the second time Ms. Novak had come across the dress on the resale market. Still, she knew her price, and she walked away.
"But I thought about it every day," she said. "Should I, should I, should I?"
Then, after two months of silence, the eBay seller unexpectedly agreed to Ms. Novak's price. She bought the dress that day.
The truth was that Ms. Novak had long found weddings "kind of cheugy," she said. But since founding Tab in 2019, Ms. Novak, a former comedy writer, had increasingly fielded requests from clients and friends to help them hunt down archival bridal wear -- pieces with "character," she said. "Wearing vintage on your wedding day, you're not just plucking it off a runway or a rack and wearing what someone told you to wear. You're infusing your own personality. It's an extension of you."
She knew of one brick-and-mortar boutique with this kind of inventory (Happy Isles in Los Angeles) but none with a strong online store. "I felt like, from a business standpoint, I was leaving money on the table," she said.
So on Monday, she introduced a collection of about 85 bridal and wedding guest pieces on the Tab Vintage website, furthering a push into the market that began earlier this year.
In January, she was a co-host in Los Angeles of a three-day bridal and evening-wear event with Re-See, a resale company in Paris. All 72 shopping appointments were reserved weeks in advance. "It was madness," Ms. Novak said. A tearful altercation between two brides who wanted the same ruched strapless Loris Azzaro dress reminded Ms. Novak of a sign she once saw outside Amarcord Vintage Fashion in New York: "Nothing haunts you like the vintage you didn't buy."
Then in February, she teamed up with the online luxury retailer Moda Operandi on a selection of wedding dresses, suits and separates, including a 2004 Balenciaga "puffball" gown (reissued from an original 1951 design) and a 2006 Alexander McQueen silk dress with a gold chain bodice. Both sold for around $ 20,000.
That sale "didn't feel so bridal with a capital B," said Jamie Lenore McKillop, a brand consultant who bought a Martin Margiela couture dress from 2006, made from upcycled knits and silk. It was important to Ms. McKillop, 30, who lives in Los Angeles and is getting married in Sea Ranch, Calif., next summer, to find something singular.
"I'm not the girl who is embarrassed if she goes to a party and she sees someone else wearing the same thing," she said. "But with social media, certain weddings and dresses will go viral. And then it really becomes her dress -- or people associate it with someone else -- versus fully your own."
She's still looking for her actual wedding dress, however; the Margiela is for her rehearsal dinner. Because that's the thing about many modern weddings: They aren't just weddings. They are weekends full of welcome parties, after-parties, bridal-brunches-on-the-beach and aprés-ski-farewell lunches.
Chloe Green-Vamos's nuptial wardrobe includes a 1970s ivory Yves Saint Laurent suit ("very Bianca Jagger," she said), which she found in Paris, where the wedding will be held next spring. At the Tab Vintage and Re-See event in January, she bought two Balenciaga minidresses, circa 2000s -- one in textured brocade for the wedding brunch and the other in satin ("kind of Mia Farrow, Sharon Tate, '60s vibe") for the after-party.
She also acquired from Ms. Novak a silk cream column gown from Christian Dior's fall 1999 collection, designed by John Galliano, for her rehearsal dinner. And she is "95 percent sure" that her ceremony dress, currently on hold with Tab, will be a peachy-pink chiffon couture gown, fastened with a velvet black bow and camellia, that Claudia Schiffer wore the first time she walked the runway for Chanel in 1989. It is valued at more than $ 20,000.
Ms. Green-Vamos, 32, who is based in Los Angeles and works in strategy at Estee Lauder, likened her shopping experience to a "fashion Odyssey," in pursuit of pieces she felt would reflect her personality and story. (She studied in Paris and once worked as a buyer for Chanel, for example.) "I wanted that timeless elegance that these designers have been able to retain," she said. "This ability to stay modern, despite everything around us changing."
Ms. Novak herself also wore multiple looks to celebrate her wedding to Mr. Valentine on, yes, Valentine's Day. After the Céline gown, which had been tailored for a tight fit -- its turtleneck was temporarily detached for the occasion -- she changed into a more comfortable red jersey one-shoulder Halston dress from the 1970s. (In searching for her perfect slinky Halston, Ms. Novak acquired at least six; some have made their way into Tab's collection and onto the bodies of celebrities like Madelyn Cline at a Vanity Fair party.) Her veil was an upcycled pink embroidered Dries Van Noten cardigan, found on Vestiaire Collective.
There was also the elopement dress she wore on Feb. 5, when she legally married Mr. Valentine at their home in Los Angeles. The cream gown dated to the 1920s. She had her tailor turn its long sheer sleeves into a halter neckline to make it look "undone but still classic," she said.
Like some of the best vintage pieces, it had no designer label.

Full text: Friday
3 p.m. | ride the waterfront
Start your weekend as many Panamanian families do, on the Amador Causeway. This man-made peninsula, built from rock unearthed during the Panama Canal's construction, connects what was once a series of small islands. From Moses Bike Rentals (bicycle, $ 4 an hour), cruise the causeway's protected bike highway -- stopping to gawk at massive container ships at the canal's entrance or to suck down a pipa fria (iced coconut water) -- to the Punta Culebra Nature Center ( $ 8 adults, $ 2 children). (Most attractions charge different admission fees for citizens and foreigners.) A lesser-known alternative to the Frank Gehry-designed Biomuseo nearby, this Smithsonian-run center offers acres of tropical dry forest where sloths sprawl overhead, child-size iguanas guard the fountains and crab-eating raccoons prowl. The indoor exhibits display moray eels, phosphorescent anemones and Panama's famous, and highly poisonous, golden frog.
4:30 p.m. | Make a fish pit stop
On Flamenco Island, a short ride down the causeway from the Nature Center, is the new location of the beloved ceviche spot Capitán Bahía. The original, in the San Francisco neighborhood, evokes the cevicherias of the Mercado de Mariscos, the city's indispensable fish market, with its concrete counters and affordable prices. The Amador location is a bigger, slicker space that lacks some of the soul of the first, but the menu is the same (if, sadly, the prices are not). For a light snack, order the delicate robalo (a basslike white fish) ceviche marinated in passion fruit ( $ 9) and a refreshing house-branded coconut and pineapple lager ( $ 5).
6:30 p.m. | explore the Old Town
A generation ago, Casco Viejo, the Old Town, was considered a crumbling relic. But in 1997, the historic district, which is the oldest surviving European settlement on the Pacific Coast of the Americas, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since then, many of its striking structures have been restored and -- for better or worse -- reborn as foreign-owned boutique hotels and upscale cafes. Wander with your eyes up (avoiding the occasional sidewalk hole), delighting in the Spanish Colonial, French and Caribbean architecture and plant-draped balconies. Stroll to the walled waterfront of Paseo de las Bóvedas at dusk, when the bird chorus competes with urban traffic. Before dinner, stop at Mayda bar inside the Sofitel Legend, a new hotel in a 1917 building and former social club that features a floor-to-ceiling, hand-painted tile mural of the Panama Canal project.
8:30 p.m. | Eat pork belly guacho
Fonda Lo Que Hay, a sultry and perpetually bustling restaurant in Casco Viejo, is a pandemic pivot. Early in 2020, the chef José Olmedo Carles had just expanded his widely acclaimed prix fixe restaurant, Donde José. When the business was walloped by the pandemic, he rebuilt it as Lo Que Hay, a name that translates roughly to "that's what there is." More casual than its predecessor but no less ambitious, the "fonda" (what Panamanians call an inexpensive roadside canteen, although Mr. Carles says the name is mostly nostalgic) serves shareable dishes that include a cassava tostada topped with tuna carpaccio ( $ 15), a pork belly guacho (Panamanian rice porridge) with airy chicharrón ( $ 15) and two flawless pieces of fried chicken with silky mashed potatoes and gravy ( $ 16) that invoke the long U.S. presence in Panama.
Saturday
8 a.m. | Sip the exceptional
In Cangrejo, Mentiritas Blancas is a homey neighborhood coffee house (whose name translates to "Little White Lies") that roasts its own beans and is owned by a trio of siblings who run it like a living room where all are welcome. One wall is papered with notes left by customers, another has illustrations of the small-scale coffee farmers the cafe works with. In the last two decades, Panamanian Geisha (or Gesha) coffee beans -- a variety that originated in Ethiopia but thrives in Panama's high-altitude volcanic soil -- have soared in global prestige and price. (Last year, a pound of exclusive, specially processed Geisha sold for a record-breaking $ 6,034.) You can have breakfast at the cafe and on your way out buy a bag of coffee beans (including its Geisha, $ 35 per pound) in floral-printed packaging, a dream gift for a coffee-loving friend.
9:30 a.m. | step into the past
Panamá Viejo, an archaeological site at the edge of a mangrove forest, preserves the remnants of Panama City's earliest Spanish settlement, founded in 1519. The city was raided and destroyed by the pirate Henry Morgan in 1671 and later relocated to Casco Viejo. The 79 acres of ruins are now littered with fallen mangoes and draped with banyan vines, and the excavated structures are marked with in-depth signs. (Adult tickets, $ 10; children, $ 3.) The Museum of the Plaza Mayor (admission included), which opened at the site in 2017, also delves into the site's pre-Hispanic history and the region's Indigenous peoples, who began farming and fishing the muddy flats of Panama Bay more than 1,500 years ago. Climb the nearly 100-foot-high cathedral bell tower for a glimpse of the city to the southwest.
1 p.m. | Linger over lunch
Don't be surprised if the taxi driver seems confused when you pull up at Maito in the lush Coco del Mar neighborhood. From the street, the celebrated restaurant looks like a gravel lot backed by a thicket of bamboo. That lack of pretense extends inside, where families gather on the expansive patio for a leisurely meal beneath a corrugated roof, fans whirring slowly overhead and not a white tablecloth in sight. Attentive servers wear black dress shirts and the chef Mario Castrellón's tasting menu ( $ 75) turns regional dishes of Panama and the Caribbean into museum pieces. Two standouts from the à la carte menu: "ceshimi" (a portmanteau of ceviche and sashimi) that has paper-thin slices of corvina fish, red onion and jalapeño ( $ 15), and pillowy shrimp wontons with passion fruit sauce ( $ 9).
4 p.m. | Skip the tchotchkes
Because no one needs more knickknacks, stop into CACAO Bar Selection, a tiny chocolate shop and cafe in San Francisco, for edible souvenirs. The shop features hundreds of bite-size, multicolored chocolates, made by the craft chocolate brand Oro Moreno, in Central American flavors like culantro (a pungent herb), coconut and curry, and aji chombo, the fruity chile that stars in the orange hot sauce on many Panamanian tables. Chocolates are available to buy individually ( $ 2 each) or by the box; the bright, lacquered wood "Fauna Panameña" sets, illustrated with jungle scenes, start at $ 22.
6:30 p.m. | Go old school
El Trapiche, a family-style restaurant, and now a small chain, that serves unpretentious Panamanian food, celebrates its 40th anniversary this year. The Vía Argentina location is the original, with the charmingly worn leather chairs and the formica table tops to prove it (a framed photograph of the boxer and favorite son Roberto Duran also hangs on the restaurant's wall). On any given night here, you might see canoodling couples, foreign students and a Panamanian celebrity all dining within an arm's length of one another. The wide-ranging menu includes a hearty hojaldra sandwich, a Panamanian fry bread stuffed with a variety of fillings (including Creole-seasoned meats, fried plantains and black beans, from $ 5.50). Then, en route to Casco, stop at Keene's, an ice cream shop that's locally beloved for its changing assortment of bright, tropical flavors.
10:30 p.m. | Love the nightlife
Fuel your night out with a Coke or a cafe con leche at the Café Coca Cola on Plaza Santa Ana, which -- according to its creation myth -- has been serving revolutionaries, dictators, Hollywood actors and celebrated poets since the late 19th century. On the edge of Casco, this historic diner and its beautiful neighboring plaza offer a taste of what the Old Town used to be. Walk two blocks to the Selina hostel's rooftop bar and restaurant, Tacos La Neta, which turns into a party scene at night, when D.J.s play cumbia or remixes of the Cuban American singer Celia Cruz until 2 a.m. A glimpse of the city's nightlife is worth the cost of admission ( $ 5), and there are plant-filled nooks in which to drink and people-watch. It's packed after 9:30 p.m. or so on weekends, with throngs waiting to get in.
Sunday
9 a.m. | Try a local coffee chain
While locals might proudly refer to Café Unido as the "Starbucks of Panama," this fast-growing mini coffee empire is many times better, and more interesting, than the comparison suggests. Now with nine shops in Panama and a new location in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, Unido is the rare chain to take its food as seriously as its coffee. Its breakfast sandwich -- with a fried egg, bacon, cheese, guacamole and Buffalo sauce ( $ 9) -- is a satisfying and hangover-defeating choice. The Casco Viejo location is a great place to dine in and enjoy bottomless mimosas ( $ 15) on Sunday, or to grab a guava empanada ( $ 1.25) and an espresso to sip on a bench in the Plaza Herrera around the corner.
10:30 a.m. | Take an art trip
The tiny, Pepto-Bismol pink Monsters + Rako showroom feels like a sassy response to the ubiquitous Panama hats and mass-produced artesania sold around the corner on Casco's Avenue A. The shop, which opened in January, sells the work of a brother-and-sister team: Andres (whose artist name is Rako) and Estefania (who founded the design brand Monsters) Rivera. The duo's warm-hearted and humorous designs adorn the store's eclectic mix of clothing, gifts, artwork and colorful, well-crafted journals and sketchbooks. Tropically hued silk scarfs ( $ 22) are printed with Monsters' caricatures of Panamanian icons -- toucans, frogs and plaza raspao (shaved ice) vendors -- and Rako's Pop Art-style prints (from $ 5, postcard size, to $ 500, framed pieces) have political undertones that also occasionally poke fun at Casco's tourist swarms.
Noon | admire ornate textiles
Spend any time where tourists are likely to open their wallets and you'll encounter Indigenous Guna women selling mola, the stunning, ornate textiles they make using reverse appliqué (a technique that involves sewing and cutting away layers of fabric), each taking an average of 60 hours to create. Opened in 2019, the deeply moving and visually rich Museo de la Mola (free, with visits limited to 45 minutes) displays some 200 of these intricate pieces with informative placards offering cultural and historical context. It also has interactive exhibits allowing visitors to attempt their own designs and an immersive mirror box that you stand inside as mola designs are projected on all sides. More important, it honors the Guna, most of whom live in the remote, politically autonomous San Blas Islands, by respecting their stories and craft.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The indoors prohibition, in New York City, was just one public health accomplishment. His global efforts on behalf of woman and children saved countless lives.
Dr. Colin McCord, a surgeon credited with saving countless lives by championing a draconian ban on smoking in New York City and limits on trans fats in processed foods, galvanizing improved health care for Black men in Harlem, and improving maternal and child health globally, died on March 11 at his home in Oxford, England. He was 94.
His son, Andy, said the cause was congestive heart failure.
Dr. McCord, who was known as Coke, trained lay people as paraprofessional doctors and surgeons in Mozambique and other African nations decimated by the departure of medical personnel; proved the efficacy of oral rehydration to save infants stricken with diarrhea in India and Bangladesh; and helped reduce birthrates in Bangladesh by teaching women to deliver advice on contraception and reproductive health. Those international initiatives probably spared millions of lives.
He also exercised a profound impact on public conduct and health policy in New York City.
Dr. McCord successfully lobbied for a ban on smoking in workplaces, restaurants and bars while he was an assistant health commissioner in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration. The ban, which took effect in 2003, was later expanded and replicated in jurisdictions around the world.
New York had banned smoking in most restaurants in 1995, but the city continued to allow smoking in bars and the bar areas of restaurants. As the son of chain smokers who both died of cancer, Dr. McCord described himself as "the heaviest secondhand smoker in New York City."
"It is the most important epidemic of our time," he said in 2002, when the ban was expanded to include bars. "Each year the Health Department signs death certificates of 10,000 New Yorkers who died because of a tobacco-related cause; 1,000 of these people died because of exposure to secondhand smoke."
Years earlier, Dr. McCord and a fellow researcher created a sensation when they disclosed in a 1990 article in the authoritative New England Journal of Medicine that Black men in Harlem were less likely to live to the age of 65 than men in Bangladesh, which was one of the world's poorest nation's when it was created in 1971.
The report not only caused a stir; it also produced results.
Dr. McCord was named director of a federally funded prevention program at Harlem Hospital, a division of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation. Programs were initiated, as recommended by the report, to address the known causes of early death from chronic disease, including breast cancer screenings and neonatal testing. And investments were made to improve the delivery of health care in an overwhelmed system.
Dr. McCord and Dr. Harold P. Freeman of Columbia University and Harlem Hospital, with whom he created the report, concluded that their findings were "not an isolated phenomenon," and that the racial disparities in life expectancy, particularly for Black men and poor people in general, were mirrored elsewhere in the city and around the nation.
Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, who had been the city's health commissioner when Dr. McCord was an assistant commissioner, cited his "clarity of thinking, ethical commitment and effective action," which he said saved lives.
"Coke's work on child survival made it more likely that millions of children would survive," Dr. Frieden said in an email. "His work on surgery saved thousands of mothers and children. And his catalytic thinking on trans fat helped trigger a global movement that will prevent millions of deaths from heart attack."
Dr. McCord was born Colin Wallace Miller on May 15, 1928, in Chicago to Colin Miller, who became a news agency correspondent and movie producer, and George Lial Mickelberry, who was known as Sis.
He was always referred to as Coke, a variation of his father's nickname, Coco.
His parents' marriage was annulled within a year, and Coke was raised by his mother, who was a teenager. When he was about 4, his mother married A. King McCord, who became chairman of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company. Coke was formally adopted by Mr. McCord when he was 16.
He enrolled in a military training program at Chicago Harvard School during World War II, but the war ended before the Army could deploy him to the Pacific.
After graduating in 1949 from Williams College in Massachusetts, where he majored in chemistry, he earned a medical degree from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1953. He served his residency in surgery at Bellevue Hospital and in thoracic surgery at Bellevue and Presbyterian Hospitals.
He married Susan Lewis Hobson in 1954; she died in 2002. He moved to England in about 2004.
In addition to his son, Dr. McCord is survived by two daughters, Mary McCord and Anne McCord Wrublewski; his second wife, Susanne Ehrhardt Chowdhury; a stepdaughter, Bristi Chowdhury; a sister, Leslie Danforth; and four grandchildren.
After completing his surgical residency, Dr. McCord taught at the University of Oregon, Portland; directed rural health programs in India and Bangladesh for the Department of International Health at Johns Hopkins University; and served as director of surgical services at a hospital in Mozambique from 1981 to 1986.
After returning to New York in 1987, he was named associate director of surgery at Harlem Hospital, when he collaborated with Dr. Freeman.
The two men found that while a large proportion of the so-called excess deaths among Black men in Harlem resulted from violence and drug abuse, most of the excess was attributable to other causes.
"The bottom-line problem is poverty," Dr. Freeman told The Times in 1990. "People who are intensely poor have other priorities. People think present tense. They don't think future. They think about making it through the day. People are fighting for their lives."

Inside Policing Tools That Change The Game: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A brain wave reader that can detect lies. Miniaturized cameras that sit inside vape pens and disposable coffee cups. Massive video cameras that zoom in more than a kilometer to capture faces and license plates.
At a police conference in Dubai in March, new technologies for the security forces of the future were up for sale. Far from the eyes of the general public, the event provided a rare look at what tools are now available to law enforcement around the world: better and harder-to-detect surveillance, facial recognition software that automatically tracks individuals across cities and computers to break into phones.
Advances in artificial intelligence, drones and facial recognition have created an increasingly global police surveillance business. Israeli hacking software, American investigation tools and Chinese computer vision algorithms can all be bought and mixed together to make a snooping cocktail of startling effectiveness.
Fueled by a surge of spending from Middle Eastern countries such as the United Arab Emirates -- the conference's host and an aggressive adopter of next-generation security technologies -- the event pointed to how tools of mass surveillance once believed to be widespread only in China are proliferating. The rising use of the technologies signals an era of policing based as much on software, data and code as on officers and weaponry, raising questions about the effects on people's privacy and how political power is wielded.
"A lot of surveillance could ostensibly be benign or used to improve a city," said Daragh Murray, a senior lecturer of law at Queen Mary University in London who has studied police use of technology. "But the flip side of the coin is it can give you incredible insight into people's everyday lives. That can have an unintended chilling effect or be a tool for actual repression."
The gold rush was evident at a convention center in the heart of downtown Dubai, where uniformed police representatives from around the world browsed drones that could be launched and powered up remotely. Chinese camera makers showed software to identify when crowds gather. American companies like Dell and Cisco had booths offering police services. Cellebrite, an Israeli maker of systems to break into mobile phones, exhibited inside a "government zone" blocked off from the rest of the conference.
Other companies sold facial recognition eyeglasses and sentiment analysis software, in which an algorithm determines a person's mood from facial expressions. Some products, like a Segway with a rifle mount, pushed the limits of practicality.
"Nowadays, the police force, they don't think about the guns or weapons that they're carrying," said Maj. Gen. Khalid Alrazooqi, the Dubai Police's general director of A.I. "You're looking for the tools, the technology."
With its deep pockets, serious security challenges and autocratic government, the Emirates, an important American ally in the Middle East, has become a case study in the potential, and risks, of such policing technologies. The tools can help stop crime and terror attacks but can also become an undemocratic buttress of political power.
Under the leadership of Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, often referred to by his initials, M.B.Z., Emirati authorities have surveilled critics and activists. Amnesty International and other groups have accused the oil-rich country of human rights abuses against adversaries, including using the Pegasus phone spyware made by the NSO Group of Israel. Protests and free expression in the authoritarian monarchy are severely limited, part of what the government has said is an effort to combat Islamic extremism.
One tech firm based in the Emirates with ties to the country's leadership, Presight AI, sells software nearly identical to products that are popular with the Chinese police. At the conference, its software used cameras and A.I. to identify people, store data about their appearance and track their routes as they wandered the event.
A lack of transparency and oversight for the way surveillance technologies are used opens up the potential for abuse, said Marc O. Jones, author of the book "Digital Authoritarianism in the Middle East" and a professor at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar.
"The region has become so securitized, and under M.B.Z., the U.A.E. has become so focused on security there's almost this fetishization of technology," he said.
Cameras are especially prevalent in the two largest emirates, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Dubai, which is flashier and more freewheeling, has cameras tucked away in unassuming corners. In Abu Dhabi, the more conservative center of political power, cameras dominate the cityscape. Grey metal towers that support them shaped like T's and L's hang over roads at predictable intervals.
General Alrazooqi, the Dubai Police's A.I. general director, said in an interview that the cameras were part of a yearslong campaign to become a global leader in police technology -- even though the emirate, which has a population of about 3.5 million, is known for low crime. In recent years, Emirati officials visited police departments and companies in China, Europe and the United States for ideas. The consulting companies KPMG and Gartner were hired to help with the process, the general said. Dubai bought facial recognition systems from Chinese companies including Hikvision and Huawei.
KPMG, Gartner, Huawei and Hikvision declined to comment.
"We pick what is the best practice in each country and to try to perfect and inject it in the system that we have," General Alrazooqi said. He added that the "Chinese are the best" at computer vision and facial recognition.
The Middle East has become a "petri dish of different actors," with China, Russia and the United States vying for influence through their technologies, Mr. Jones said. The heavy presence of Chinese technologies -- most cameras visible on the streets are Chinese -- is a sign of the country's rising influence in the Persian Gulf.
Dubai's police run next-generation systems from a headquarters north of the downtown skyscrapers and malls. One of those systems, a citywide facial recognition program called Oyoon -- Arabic for eyes -- can pull the identity of anyone passing one of at least 10,000 cameras, linking to a database of images from airport customs and residents' identification cards. The police have also required businesses to provide video from their security systems to a centralized government database.
"It's monitoring the whole city from once you enter at the airport to when you leave," General Alrazooqi said. He said the systems served the police's "customers" -- a catchall term for the public. "People, they are happy about it," he said.
The technological abilities were on display in a police command center, where Dubai's officers could view live camera feeds and the locations of all emergency vehicles on a giant screen.
"With technology and smart cameras, if you committed a crime within a minute I will know which direction" someone is going, said Lt. Col. Bilal Al Tayer, acting director of the command and control center.
One advanced tool was predictive policing software built by engineers from Dubai with machine learning that identifies where thieves might strike next. Officials said its 68 percent accuracy rate doubled that of an older model. Inside some patrol cars, mapping software gives officers specific routes to drive based on crime data.
Another algorithm, built on the records of automobile accidents, predicted the roughly 4,000 most dangerous drivers in Dubai, who will receive reminders via text message to drive carefully. The most represented category of bad drivers was older Emirati men, followed by older South Asian men. (Nationality is a factor for the algorithm.)
At the Dubai police fair, officials from the Emirates' Ministry of Interior, which oversees state security and has access to all police cameras, demonstrated how, with a tablet, they could scan the irises of conference attendees and pull up information about when they had entered the country, complete with a recent customs photo. Also displayed was a headset that is said to detect when a part of the brain concerning memories is activated, something a ministry official said was useful during interrogations to determine if a suspect was lying.
Walking among the booths at the conference was Lt. Gen. Abdullah Khalifa Al Marri, the Dubai Police's commander in chief. The new abilities on display, however intrusive, are a means to achieve a long-elusive, utopian goal of "zero crime," he said.
"We don't break the privacy of the people," he added. "We are just monitoring."

Got Milk? For This Generation, Maybe Not.: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: To the marketers trying to reboot milk as a sports drink for Generation Z, Yvonne Zapata seemed like the perfect ambassador. An exuberant 24-year-old marathoner from Brooklyn, she describes herself as a proud Latina runner. Her nickname is Miss Outside.
The Milk Processor Education Program signed her to its 26.2 project, an ambitious effort to provide training, gear, advice and other support to every woman who runs a marathon in the United States this year. In March, Ms. Zapata's face lit up a giant Times Square billboard. She starred in her own video. Her portrait is one of several anchoring the Gonna Need Milk website.
There is only one problem: Ms. Zapata would rather drink oat milk.
"Dairy milk is good," she explained in an interview, "but I feel like realistically it's unhealthy."
She grew up hearing that dairy products weren't good for her sports-induced asthma. Then her sister became a vegan and made a strong case against them. But Ms. Zapata is dedicated to getting women with different shapes and from different cultures to embrace running, so she joined #TeamMilk.
"I feel like that's more important than whether milk is good for you," she said.
Ms. Zapata is part of the Not Milk generation, teenagers and young adults who grew up ordering milk alternatives at coffee shops and toting water bottles everywhere. Turned off by the no-fat and low-fat milks served at school, worried about climate change and steeped in the increasing skepticism toward the dairy industry on social media, many of them have never embraced milk. Last year, members of Generation Z bought 20 percent less milk than the national average, according to the consumer market research company Circana.
"Nobody drinks regular milk on purpose nowadays," said Masani Bailey, 30, who created a nostalgic deep dive into the celebrity-driven "Got Milk?" campaign from the 1990s and early 2000s for her TikTok account, @cultureunfiltered.
The dairy industry isn't banking on nostalgia to save the day. It has embarked on a full-frontal marketing assault intended to do what the "Got Milk?" mustaches on celebrities like Taylor Swift and Dennis Rodman did for previous generations.
"We have to reclaim milk's mojo," said Yin Woon Rani, the chief executive of the Milk Processor Education Program, a marketing and education arm of the dairy industry based in Washington, D.C.
The campaign takes several forms. Although the science about the health benefits and drawbacks of milk isn't settled, some studies have shown that chocolate milk contains basic electrolytes and a precise ratio of carbohydrates to protein that can help muscles recover after workouts. One strategy involves showing athletes like Ms. Zapata that milk is a good sports drink (though the Gonna Need Milk people thought she was more of a milk fan when they signed her up).
Milk processors are betting that supporting women and girls who run, and promoting gender equity in sports -- with plenty of post-race chocolate milk -- will change some minds. For every woman who joins #Team Milk, the milk processors will make a donation to Girls on the Run, a national nonprofit sports organization.
Milk marketers have also tapped Olympic medalists, women who play football and other sports influencers who swim, climb or play street soccer.
"We sometimes refer to milk as the O.G. sports drink, powering athletes for 10,000 years," Ms. Rani said.
At the other end of the activity spectrum, the industry is making a play for gamers. Milk processors declared milk the official "performance beverage" at last year's TwitchCon gaming convention in San Diego. Dairy Management Inc., a trade organization, hired the gaming superstars Preston Arsement and Jimmy Donaldson (known to his 139 million YouTube subscribers as Mr. Beast) to introduce seven new cows to Minecraft. The two streaming celebrities heaped love on the nation's dairy farmers and explained sustainable dairy-farming practices.
Some milk marketers have created Shark Tank-like contests that encourage small food entrepreneurs to invent dairy-based products aimed directly at Gen Z. One winner was Spylt, a caffeinated chocolate milk whose tagline is "Chill it. Then chug it!"
All this is not to say that young people don't eat plenty of cheese, yogurt and ice cream.
"They're not abandoning dairy," said John Crawford, a dairy analyst for Circana. "But they certainly are walking away from traditional dairy milk."
The decline has been happening for decades. Americans' annual milk consumption peaked at 45 gallons per person in 1945, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It fell to about 23 gallons in 2001, and by 2021 it was down to 16 gallons.
Although Generation Z is the target, millennials laid the groundwork for milk's identity crisis, with their focus on health and wellness and demand for transparency in the food system.
"I feel like this is another punch line about us: Did millennials kill milk?" said Rebecca Kelley, 39, a content strategy consultant in Seattle.
She and her friends drink almond milk. "I do have some old millennial guilt because I know from a sustainability perspective almond milk is not great," she said. But she also sneaks in a glass or two of whole milk with spaghetti or a tuna sandwich, despite judgy comments from friends. "For me, it's a nostalgia play."
Milk has a tougher battle with Generation Z. Born between 1997 and 2012, it's the country's most diverse ever. A bare majority are white, and 29 percent are immigrants or the children of immigrants. Many come from backgrounds in which lactose intolerance is common.
Some have turned to nut milks and other plant-based alternatives, whose sales are expected to grow by more than 9 percent a year through 2027, far faster than milk.
The dairy industry has long waged a battle to keep plant-based alternatives from using the word milk. The Food and Drug Administration in February made it clear that the war is probably over, issuing a draft ruling that drinks made from oats, almonds or other plants can be called milk. The agency did hand dairy producers a small win, recommending that packaging for plant-based drinks make clear the key nutritional differences between their products and cow's milk.
But dairy milk is still a much bigger player. In the year that ended in November, milk sales were almost $ 15.7 billion, compared with $ 2.4 billion for alternative milks.
"People are saying, 'Oh, plant-based. That's what's destroying you,' " said Ms. Rani, of the Milk Processor Education Program. "That's not it. Dairy milk sells as much at retail in a week as oat milk sells in a full year."
Dairy milk's real competition is other beverages, like water, both bottled and tap, and specialty coffee drinks.
"People come to work with a Gatorade or a Coke in one hand and a Starbucks cold brew drink in the other," said Curt Covington, senior director of partner relations at AgAmerica, an agricultural lender. "It has clearly taken away from the milk sector."
Some young people don't like milk because they didn't grow up with it as a dinner-table staple. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 removed whole or 2 percent milk from schools, and required that any flavored milk be nonfat. This led to a genre of social media posts complaining that school milk was disgusting. The Department of Agriculture in 2018 allowed 1 percent chocolate or strawberry milk back into schools.
"We lost almost an entire generation of milk drinkers," U.S. Representative Glenn Thompson, a Republican from Pennsylvania, told a farming publication.
Dairy farmers say government policies and nutritional standards have demonized whole milk, and that stigma is hurting their livelihoods. In upstate New York, roadsides are dotted with hay bales painted with messages urging the passage of a federal law that would return whole milk to schools.
In February, Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican from northern New York, reintroduced the Protecting School Milk Choices Act, a direct response to New York's mayor, Eric Adams, a vegan who has floated the idea of banning chocolate milk in schools and providing more plant-based foods.
But all the legislation and marketing in the world may not help eliminate what many Gen Z-ers refer to as "milk shame."
Hampton Searcy, 21, has felt it. He lives with three fellow students who don't like milk in an apartment near Auburn University, in Alabama, so they don't keep any in the refrigerator. Mr. Searcy grabs a cold pint of whole milk at a convenience store three or four times a week.
"People say, 'How could you not at least get chocolate milk? Why not get a soda or a sports drink?"' he said. "I just like the taste of white milk. It's either you like milk or you think it's weird. And a lot of people I know think it's weird."
Haden Gooch, 31, and Katie Gualtieri, 39, want to change that. They tend to about 50 cows on their farm in Leeds, Maine, and sell the milk to Stonyfield Organic.
"If people better understood the nuances of milk as a seasonal product that gets richer in the winter and sweeter in the summer based on what the cows are eating, and saw the effort small dairy farmers put into producing that milk to help feed and keep rural communities alive, they might like milk better," Ms. Gualtieri said.
In the end, milk's ace in the hole might not be marathons, YouTube videos or organic farming. The cultural churn that makes something a star one day and destroys it the next could be the saving grace.
Sherry Ning, a writer in Toronto, was only half-joking when she recently tweeted, "The next counterrevolution is the return of whole milk."
Her theory is akin to what Emily Sundberg suggested two years ago in a New York magazine article arguing that whole milk was making a comeback.
The dairy milk dip coincided with the rise of wellness culture and what Ms. Ning called the influence of tech-bro culture, with its overengineered, health-optimized lifestyle that demonized dairy.
Whole milk, Ms. Ning said, might be the antidote, riding a wave of neo-traditionalism among some members of Gen Z who are embracing a more down-to-earth ethos, centered on nature and regenerative farming. Call it milkcore?
"The return of cow's milk is kind of the cultural zeitgeist saying, 'Screw tech. This is too fast and science is going too far,"' she said. "Just go back to normal and stop engineering the way we live."

To the marketers trying to reboot milk as a sports drink for Generation Z, Yvonne Zapata seemed like the perfect ambassador. An exuberant 24-year-old marathoner from Brooklyn, New York, she describes herself as a proud Latina runner. Her nickname is Miss Outside.
The Milk Processor Education Program signed her to its 26.2 project, an ambitious effort to provide training, gear, advice and other support to every woman who runs a marathon in the United States this year. In March, Zapata’s face lit up a giant Times Square billboard. She starred in her own video. Her portrait is one of several anchoring the Gonna Need Milk website.
There is only one problem: Zapata would rather drink oat milk.
“Dairy milk is good,” she explained in an interview, “but I feel like realistically it’s unhealthy.”
She grew up hearing that dairy products weren’t good for her sports-induced asthma. Then her sister became a vegan and made a strong case against them. But Zapata is dedicated to getting women with different shapes and from different cultures to embrace running, so she joined #TeamMilk.
“I feel like that’s more important than whether milk is good for you,” she said.
Zapata is part of the Not Milk generation, teenagers and young adults who grew up ordering milk alternatives at coffee shops and toting water bottles everywhere. Turned off by the no-fat and low-fat milks served at school, worried about climate change and steeped in the increasing skepticism toward the dairy industry on social media, many of them have never embraced milk. Last year, members of Generation Z bought 20% less milk than the national average, according to the consumer market research company Circana.
“Nobody drinks regular milk on purpose nowadays,” said Masani Bailey, 30, who created a nostalgic deep dive into the celebrity-driven “Got Milk?” campaign from the 1990s and early 2000s for her TikTok account, @cultureunfiltered.
The dairy industry isn’t banking on nostalgia to save the day. It has embarked on a full-frontal marketing assault intended to do what the “Got Milk?” mustaches on celebrities like Taylor Swift and Dennis Rodman did for previous generations.
“We have to reclaim milk’s mojo,” said Yin Woon Rani, the chief executive of the Milk Processor Education Program, a marketing and education arm of the dairy industry based in Washington, D.C.
The campaign takes several forms. Although the science about the health benefits and drawbacks of milk isn’t settled, some studies have shown that chocolate milk contains basic electrolytes and a precise ratio of carbohydrates to protein that can help muscles recover after workouts. One strategy involves showing athletes such as Zapata that milk is a good sports drink (though the Gonna Need Milk people thought she was more of a milk fan when they signed her up).
Milk processors are betting that supporting women and girls who run, and promoting gender equity in sports — with plenty of post-race chocolate milk — will change some minds. For every woman who joins #TeamMilk, the milk processors will make a donation to Girls on the Run, a national nonprofit sports organization.
Milk marketers have also tapped Olympic medalists, women who play football and other sports influencers who swim, climb or play street soccer.
“We sometimes refer to milk as the OG sports drink, powering athletes for 10,000 years,” Rani said.
At the other end of the activity spectrum, the industry is making a play for gamers. Milk processors declared milk the official “performance beverage” at last year’s TwitchCon gaming convention in San Diego. Dairy Management Inc., a trade organization, hired gaming superstars Preston Arsement and Jimmy Donaldson (known to his 139 million YouTube subscribers as Mr. Beast) to introduce seven new cows to Minecraft. The two streaming celebrities heaped love on the nation’s dairy farmers and explained sustainable dairy-farming practices.
Some milk marketers have created Shark Tank-like contests that encourage small food entrepreneurs to invent dairy-based products aimed directly at Gen Z. One winner was Spylt, a caffeinated chocolate milk whose tagline is “Chill it. Then chug it!”
All this is not to say that young people don’t eat plenty of cheese, yogurt and ice cream.
“They’re not abandoning dairy,” said John Crawford, a dairy analyst for Circana. “But they certainly are walking away from traditional dairy milk.”
The decline has been happening for decades. Americans’ annual milk consumption peaked at 45 gallons per person in 1945, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It fell to about 23 gallons in 2001, and by 2021 it was down to 16 gallons.
Although Generation Z is the target, millennials laid the groundwork for milk’s identity crisis, with their focus on health and wellness and demand for transparency in the food system.
“I feel like this is another punchline about us: Did millennials kill milk?” said Rebecca Kelley, 39, a content strategy consultant in Seattle.
She and her friends drink almond milk. “I do have some old millennial guilt because I know from a sustainability perspective almond milk is not great,” she said. But she also sneaks in a glass or two of whole milk with spaghetti or a tuna sandwich, despite judgy comments from friends. “For me, it’s a nostalgia play.”
Milk has a tougher battle with Generation Z. Born between 1997 and 2012, it’s the country’s most diverse generation ever. A bare majority are white, and 29% are immigrants or the children of immigrants. Many come from backgrounds in which lactose intolerance is common.
Some have turned to nut milks and other plant-based alternatives, whose sales are expected to grow by more than 9% a year through 2027, far faster than milk.
The dairy industry has long waged a battle to keep plant-based alternatives from using the word milk. The Food and Drug Administration in February made it clear that the war is probably over, issuing a draft ruling that drinks made from oats, almonds or other plants can be called milk. The agency did hand dairy producers a small win, recommending that packaging for plant-based drinks make clear the key nutritional differences between their products and cow’s milk.
But dairy milk is still a much bigger player. In the year that ended in November, milk sales were almost $15.7 billion, compared with $2.4 billion for alternative milks.
“People are saying, ‘Oh, plant-based. That’s what’s destroying you,’” said Ms. Rani, of the Milk Processor Education Program. “That’s not it. Dairy milk sells as much at retail in a week as oat milk sells in a full year.”
Dairy milk’s real competition is other beverages, like water, both bottled and tap, and specialty coffee drinks.
“People come to work with a Gatorade or a Coke in one hand and a Starbucks cold brew drink in the other,” said Curt Covington, senior director of partner relations at AgAmerica, an agricultural lender. “It has clearly taken away from the milk sector.”
Some young people don’t like milk because they didn’t grow up with it as a dinner-table staple. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 removed whole or 2% milk from schools, and required that any flavored milk be nonfat. This led to a genre of social media posts complaining that school milk was disgusting. The Department of Agriculture in 2018 allowed 1% chocolate or strawberry milk back into schools.
“We lost almost an entire generation of milk drinkers,” U.S. Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., told a farming publication.
Dairy farmers say government policies and nutritional standards have demonized whole milk, and that stigma is hurting their livelihoods. In upstate New York, roadsides are dotted with hay bales painted with messages urging the passage of a federal law that would return whole milk to schools.
In February, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., reintroduced the Protecting School Milk Choices Act, a direct response to New York’s mayor, Eric Adams, a vegan who has floated the idea of banning chocolate milk in schools and providing more plant-based foods.
But all the legislation and marketing in the world may not help eliminate what many Gen Z-ers refer to as “milk shame.”
Hampton Searcy, 21, has felt it. He lives with three fellow students who don’t like milk in an apartment near Auburn University, in Alabama, so they don’t keep any in the refrigerator. Searcy grabs a cold pint of whole milk at a convenience store three or four times a week.
“People say, ‘How could you not at least get chocolate milk? Why not get a soda or a sports drink?’” he said. “I just like the taste of white milk. It’s either you like milk or you think it’s weird. And a lot of people I know think it’s weird.”
Haden Gooch, 31, and Katie Gualtieri, 39, want to change that. They tend to about 50 cows on their farm in Leeds, Maine, and sell the milk to Stonyfield Organic.
“If people better understood the nuances of milk as a seasonal product that gets richer in the winter and sweeter in the summer based on what the cows are eating, and saw the effort small dairy farmers put into producing that milk to help feed and keep rural communities alive, they might like milk better,” Gualtieri said.
In the end, milk’s ace in the hole might not be marathons, YouTube videos or organic farming. The cultural churn that makes something a star one day and destroys it the next could be the saving grace.
Sherry Ning, a writer in Toronto, was only half-joking when she recently tweeted, “The next counterrevolution is the return of whole milk.”
Her theory is akin to what Emily Sundberg suggested two years ago in a New York magazine article arguing that whole milk was making a comeback.
The dairy milk dip coincided with the rise of wellness culture and what Ning called the influence of tech-bro culture, with its overengineered, health-optimized lifestyle that demonized dairy.
Whole milk, Ning said, might be the antidote, riding a wave of neo-traditionalism among some members of Gen Z who are embracing a more down-to-earth ethos, centered on nature and regenerative farming. Call it milkcore?
“The return of cow’s milk is kind of the cultural zeitgeist saying, ‘Screw tech. This is too fast and science is going too far,’” she said. “Just go back to normal and stop engineering the way we live.”

When in Doubt, Try Tweaking the Logo: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It's a classic move in the fashion playbook when trying to signal a new direction or herald a new designer. But are shifting sensibilities leading more brands to reconsider the humble serif?
Logos carry a peculiar, almost paradoxical burden of both inspiring loyalty and conveying novelty. A good design stands the test of time, while maintaining the allure of the new; too new, and it risks a sense of betrayal.
Consider the City of New York's recently announced, and widely panned, "We ❤️ NYC" logo, an update of "I ❤️ NY," the beloved Milton Glaser design created in 1976. High-profile logo redesigns often incite emotional uproars -- and increasingly, public discussions of the fashion of fonts.
When the British luxury brand Burberry introduced a new logo of its own last month, it seemed everyone in the fashion circuit had a hot take on typography trends.
Burberry joined two recently debuted serif logos from Ferragamo and Phoebe Philo, leading online followers to proclaim the era of serif typefaces in, and the era of "blanding" sans-serifs decidedly out.
For the uninitiated, serifs refer to the short marks, or "feet," at the ends of a letter's strokes (as seen in certain typefaces, such as the one used by The New York Times). A typeface that includes serifs is referred to as a serif, and one that does not, a sans-serif.
But for branding experts and design industry players whose daily work involves the detailed craft of custom typography and lettering, the hubbub was more a source of mild amusement.
"No one's really having the conversation about whether the logos are actually well drawn or not," said Grace Robinson-Leo, a founder and creative director at Decade, a branding studio that has consulted for Khaite, Banana Republic and Playboy.
According to Ellen Lupton, a design author and educator, the perceived binary of serif versus sans-serif is "really quite artificial" anyway. She noted that it "doesn't exist in most other writing systems that are not Latin based."
Michaël Amzalag, a founder of the art and design studio M/M Paris, described the fashion world's preoccupation between serifs and sans-serifs as "a dichotomy established decades ago, since the 1940s," pointing to the age-old rivals Chanel and Dior. His studio's brand identity for the Spanish luxury house Loewe has stayed in use for a decade -- a lifetime in internet years -- and notably bucks fashion industry trends by pairing two contrasting styles: a stately serif along with an ornate, script-style letter L.
Broadly speaking, serifs evoke "a certain historicism," said Michael Rock, a partner at the design consultancy 2x4, whose clients include Prada and Shanghai Tang. Serifs, as all typefaces, have always carried with them "the mark of a tool," he said.
Originating in the Latin alphabet, serifs date back to Roman antiquity, when inscribers would first sketch then carve letters into stone, Mr. Rock said. As a matter of function, the serifs were added as a so-called stop cut to prevent the longer strokes of letters from chipping out, he explained.
These classical forms have persisted as formal references in type design, even as technology progressed well beyond the days of chisel and stone. Sans-serifs emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as the industrial age and Modernist ideology inspired type designers to remove extraneous, ornamental vestiges of the past. Form follows function, as the adage goes, and serifs were thought to no longer serve a purpose.
"Now, we're in an age where everything is produced by digital means, and that difference between modernity and classicism is less ideological and more stylistic," Mr. Rock said. Still, the associations remain.
In the new serif logos of Ferragamo and Burberry, that subtle play for historicism may be key to winning back customer bases in an increasingly competitive landscape of newer brands. But at Daniel Lee's first show as Burberry's new designer, the new typeface -- an about-face from the brand's previous logo, a streamlined treatment created by Peter Saville less than five years ago -- took a back seat to the revival of the brand's turn-of-the-century equestrian knight design, a sort of heraldry that featured in a royal blue.
As abstracted, abbreviated signifiers, logos are but the tip of the iceberg for a large body of world-building creative work that forms a brand image, though they often attract outsize influence -- an influence that luxury fashion brands have in recent years used to steer controversy and buzz around an incoming creative director.
"Letter forms are the smallest containers for meaning," said Mathias Augustyniak, Mr. Amzalag's partner at M/M Paris, with typography offering the potential for a second layer of authorship. But the more common trend for publicity-driven redesigns, he suggested, are "more about creating noise than a true design act."
Fans of Ms. Philo, who led Celine from 2008 to 2018, still refer to Peter Miles's design of the "old Celine" logo -- which the brand's current creative director, Hedi Slimane, famously altered upon taking the reins, removing the accent over the E, among other adjustments recalling elements of the brand's 1960s logo. (Mr. Miles, who also created the mark for Ms. Philo's coming namesake brand, said of the serif-versus-sans-serif question: "Both have a place, both permanently current.")
Mr. Slimane also courted controversy during his tenure at Saint Laurent, where he dropped the Yves and replaced the previous word mark, created in 1961 by the French painter and typographer Cassandre, with a bold, all-caps sans-serif.
That, too, was an archival reference -- this time, to the original logo for the brand's ready-to-wear collection, Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, started in 1966. (The brand has since quietly reverted to a logo set in Cassandre's typeface, still absent the Yves, to form a mash-up that Mr. Amzalag referred to as "an amputation" akin to "cutting an arm off of Mona Lisa.")
In 2017, Mr. Saville, who established his career designing album artwork for Factory Records in the 1980s and is now a fashion-industry favorite for logo redesigns (including the latest one for Ferragamo), updated the Calvin Klein logo when Raf Simons took the helm.
Copycats exist throughout fashion, as a popular meme shows, listing examples of luxury brands -- Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Burberry, Berluti, Balmain -- whose logos had gone sans-serif within the past five to six years.
Starting a new label with a blank slate, however, the new Phoebe Philo logo designed by Mr. Miles, set in all-caps Times New Roman -- the familiar, default typeface of Microsoft Office -- breaks from the pack with a sort of rebellious indifference.
Mr. Rock described it as "a typographic version of a studied blankness, what in Italian might be called sprezzatura" -- a knowing and cool nonchalance belying a precise eye.
"Make no doubt about it, though," he said. "This takes enormous effort to achieve."
Ms. Robinson-Leo expressed an appreciation for the aesthetic created by Ms. Philo and Mr. Miles, though she said she could not quite put her finger on what exactly she admired about it. "When a logo is really beautiful and really well drawn, it really stands the test of time, and it often sets the tone for a kind of style or aesthetic that other people get excited about," she said.
The online hive has quieted its parsing of Burberry's new face, and it's too soon to know how it will fare over time. It's also possible that nobody will notice or remember.
"In the same way that social media is so immediate," Mr. Rock said, "it also has really short memories."

Full text: An exchange on Fifth Avenue, sketching on the C and more reader tales of New York City in this week's Metropolitan Diary.
Heavy Traffic
Dear Diary:
I was riding my bike on Fifth Avenue south of 55th Street. Traffic was heavy. Suddenly, a cabdriver with four young male passengers cut across a lane and screamed at me in an unfriendly voice.
"Hey, lady," he yelled, "Why don't you get yourself a horse?"
I didn't respond and instead kept an eye on the cab as I continued on downtown. When it was forced to stop and wait at a light, I sidled up to the driver's window and leaned in.
"And you sir," I said in a soft voice, "should get yourself a broom."
I heard a loud burst of laughter from inside the car.
The light changed, and we continued along at about the same pace. When we reached 34th Street, the driver leaned out of the window.
"Lady," he said, "please accept my apology."
"An apology from a cabdriver!" I said. "No one will believe me, but apology accepted."
-- Dorian Cusick
On the C
Dear Diary:
I was on a downtown C train. There was a man in front of me with a hat and curly hair.
Across from him was a young woman.
I noticed that she was doodling on a piece of paper.
She was drawing him.
When she was done, she showed him the drawing.
He smiled and took a picture. Then she showed the drawing to me.
Everyone smiled.

Dirt
Dear Diary:
At Prince Street
I suck a small
tart found in a
pocket nest of
tobacco and lint
from last winter.
The train pulls in.
A woman is
folding a map
mouthing the route
to herself,
girls in dark lipsticks
get on, talking
loudly of rats,
drowning the chime.
The doors shudder
then close, open
and shut once more.
I'm nodding off
by 34th
and top out at
Times Square, each spot
lighted a show:
saxophone player
in shorts blows out
workable riffs
casting for ears
with a brass pole.
A conductress
telling stories.
An old sailor
considers fakes
on black velvet.
Further up a
gospel singer
in beads and gown,
a man renting
a telescope aimed
at the moon.
-- William Clark
100,000 Steps
Dear Diary:
When I visited New York over the summer, I set a goal for myself for a return visit that I had planned for November: If there was a day with a high temperature of around 50 degrees and no rain in the forecast, I would try to walk 100,000 steps in one day.
A day came when the conditions were right, so I set out from Long Island City at 2 a.m. and walked all the way down Queens Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue to Citi Field.
I knew from early morning La Guardia flights that Jackson Heights and Corona were vibrant neighborhoods even in the middle of the night and would be perfectly safe.
I headed back toward Manhattan as day broke and walked the perimeter of Roosevelt Island. I especially enjoyed the statue honoring the journalist Nellie Bly, who exposed conditions at an asylum on what was then known as Blackwell's Island.
In the early afternoon, I crossed the Brooklyn Bridge for the first time since the death of the author David McCullough and reflected on what an accomplished historian and writer you must be to get so many people to read a 600-page book about a bridge.
It was a little after 6 p.m. when I exceeded the 100,000-step mark in front of the old Union Square Savings Bank, completely oblivious to the fact that the building was the new home of the Off Broadway show "Titanique."
By the end of the day, I had recorded 113,772 steps, and my appreciation for all of the city's gems was even greater than it had been when I started out before dawn.
-- Tom Jensen
Pizza Place
Dear Diary:
In 1979, I was a freshman in high school. On a warm spring day my friend and I took the Long Island Rail Road into the city to sign up for an American Youth Hostel bicycle tour.
Having finished our business by noon, we looked around for someplace to eat. We saw a pizza place with a line of people out the door. The line was moving quickly, so we joined it.
When I got to the front, I placed my order.
"Two slices and a Coke," I said.
"Two slices, Coke," the counterman repeated.
Within an instant, the food was in front of me.
My friend ordered next.
"I'll have the same," he said.
"Same," the counterman repeated. And then he ran through a door into the back.
My friend and I stood there for about a minute, wondering what was going on.
When the counterman reappeared, he had another man with him.
"Here's Sam," he said.

Hidden Technology Put the Wrong Person in Jail: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Because of a bad facial recognition match and other hidden technology, Randal Reid spent nearly a week in jail, falsely accused of stealing purses in a state he said he had never even visited.
On the Friday afternoon after Thanksgiving, Randal Quran Reid was driving his white Jeep to his mother's home outside Atlanta when he was pulled over on a busy highway. A police officer approached his vehicle and asked for his driver's license. Mr. Reid had left it at home, but he volunteered his name. After asking Mr. Reid if he had any weapons, the officer told him to step out of the Jeep and handcuffed him with the help of two other officers who had arrived.
"What did I do?" Mr. Reid asked. The officer said he had two theft warrants out of Baton Rouge and Jefferson Parish, a district on the outskirts of New Orleans. Mr. Reid was confused; he said he had never been to Louisiana.
Mr. Reid, a transportation analyst, was booked at the DeKalb County jail, to await extradition from Georgia to Louisiana. It took days to find out exactly what he was accused of: using stolen credit cards to buy designer purses.
"I'm locked up for something I have no clue about," Mr. Reid, 29, said.
His parents made phone calls, hired lawyers and spent thousands of dollars to figure out why the police thought he was responsible for the crime, eventually discovering it was because Mr. Reid bore a resemblance to a suspect who had been recorded by a surveillance camera. The case eventually fell apart and the warrants were recalled, but only after Mr. Reid spent six days in jail and missed a week of work.
Mr. Reid's wrongful arrest appears to be the result of a cascade of technologies -- beginning with a bad facial recognition match -- that are intended to make policing more effective and efficient but can also make it far too easy to apprehend the wrong person for a crime. None of the technologies are mentioned in official documents, and Mr. Reid was not told exactly why he had been arrested, a typical but troubling practice, according to legal experts and public defenders.
"In a democratic society, we should know what tools are being used to police us," said Jennifer Granick, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union.
A Contract With Clearview AI
In a panic, Mr. Reid's family immediately retained an Atlanta lawyer from the Cochran Firm. He could not get Mr. Reid out of jail, and he struggled to gather more information. He suggested that the family members hire someone in Louisiana, so they cold-called law firms in Jefferson Parish and Baton Rouge until they found Thomas Calogero, a criminal defense lawyer. They retained him that Sunday.
Mr. Calogero found out that Mr. Reid was accused of the summer thefts of two Chanel purses and a brown Louis Vuitton bag, collectively worth almost $ 13,000, from Second Act, a consignment store on the outskirts of New Orleans. Mr. Calogero went to the store and talked to the owner, who showed him a still from a surveillance camera. He realized that one of the alleged fraudsters looked like Mr. Reid, but the man was heavier.
"The guy had big arms, and my client doesn't," Mr. Calogero said. A Jefferson Parish sheriff's officer insisted it was a "positive match," language that made Mr. Calogero believe that facial recognition technology had been used, and he spoke to the New Orleans news outlet NOLA.com about what he believed had happened.
A person with direct knowledge of the investigation confirmed to The New York Times that facial recognition technology had been used to identify Mr. Reid. Yet none of the documents used to arrest him disclosed that.
Andrew Bartholomew, the Jefferson Parish financial crimes detective who sought the warrant to arrest Mr. Reid, wrote in an affidavit only that he had been "advised by a credible source" that the "heavyset black male" was Mr. Reid. Reached by phone, Detective Bartholomew declined to comment.
"It's untenable to me as a matter of basic criminal procedure that people who are subject to arrest are not informed of what got them there," said Barry Friedman, a constitutional law professor at New York University.
The Sheriff's Office has a contract with one facial recognition vendor: Clearview AI, which it pays $ 25,000 a year. According to documents obtained by The Times in a public records request, the department first signed a contract with Clearview in 2019.
Clearview scraped billions of photos from the public web, including social media sites, to create a face-based search engine now used by law enforcement agencies. Mr. Reid has many public photos on the web linked to his name, including on LinkedIn and Facebook. The public information office for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office did not respond to requests for comment about the use of Clearview AI.
The company's chief executive, Hoan Ton-That, said an arrest should not be based on a facial recognition search alone.
"Even if Clearview AI came up with the initial result, that is the beginning of the investigation by law enforcement to determine, based on other factors, whether the correct person has been identified," he said. "More than one million searches have been conducted using Clearview AI. One false arrest is one too many, and we have tremendous empathy for the person who was wrongfully accused."
Detective Bartholomew's identification of Mr. Reid led to a second warrant for his arrest in East Baton Rouge Parish, where, according to a police report, the man he resembled had used a stolen credit card to buy a $ 2,800 Chanel bag at another consignment store.
The Baton Rouge Police Department "trusted the information" from the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, a department spokesman, Sgt. L'Jean McKneely, said. "What methods they used, we do not know," he added.
Law enforcement officers generally say they do not need to mention the use of facial recognition technology because it is only a lead in a case and not the sole reason for someone's arrest, protecting it from exposure as if it were a confidential informant. But according to Clare Garvie, an expert on the police use of facial recognition, there are four other publicly known cases of wrongful arrests that appear to have involved little investigation beyond a face match, all involving Black men. She has come across a handful of other examples across the country, she said, in her work with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
For Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, a racial justice advocacy group, the technology exacerbates the problems of what he called "racist policing."
"If facial recognition was misclassifying white people, white men or white women, it would not be on the shelf," he said. "Some of us and some of our communities are expendable."
'Rubber-Stamping Warrants'
To get a warrant to arrest someone, an officer must convince a judge there is probable cause -- meaning, essentially, there is a good reason to do so -- and get the judge's signature. In the past, that meant an officer had to go to court, or even meet a judge at a diner in the middle of the night if the case was urgent. That is a moment when questions are asked about the strength of the evidence, legal experts say.
But the friction of getting a warrant has been eased by technology. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office uses an "eWarrant" service, CloudGavel, for which it paid $ 39,800 last year. It's an app that allows officers to request digital signatures from judges. "Law enforcement officers can now get an arrest warrant approved in minutes," the company's website states.
Many civil liberties advocates actually favor electronic warrants; they allow judges to more easily review decisions made by the police and eliminate a complaint from officers that it's too hard to get a warrant. But advocates said it would be worrisome if judges were simply clicking a button without asking questions or providing sufficient scrutiny.
"There are real questions about whether it increases the incidence of judges rubber-stamping warrants," said Nathan Freed Wessler, a deputy director with the A.C.L.U.'s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project.
A criminal court judge signed off on Mr. Reid's arrest warrant at 4:28 p.m. on July 18. CloudGavel "accommodates" judicial scrutiny, said Casey Roussel, the president and chief operating officer of CloudGavel's parent company, FusionStak, in an email. He said judges could "connect with the officer via phone or video to discuss any concerns the judge may have about the warrant."
In Mr. Reid's case, it is unclear if the detective spoke with the judge or explained the nature of the "credible source." The judge declined to comment.
A 'Random Query'
"I was driving the normal speed, and I wasn't doing anything crazy," Mr. Reid said of the day of his arrest.
Body camera footage obtained by The Times reveals that four police vehicles were involved in pulling him over. The two warrants for his arrest asked for "full extradition." To the law enforcement officers in Georgia, Mr. Reid would have appeared to be a fugitive from Louisiana justice.
Why exactly Mr. Reid and his white Jeep attracted the DeKalb County police's attention that day is unclear. The arresting officer wrote in an incident report that he had learned about Mr. Reid's warrants from a "random GCIC/NCIC query of the vehicle tag," referring to the National Crime Information Center, an F.B.I. repository of wanted persons and vehicles, and the Georgia Crime Information Center. It's possible the officer saw Mr. Reid driving by and, for some reason, decided to run his license plate.
But Molly Kleinman, the director of a technology policy research center at the University of Michigan, said many kinds of surveillance technologies on the highway could have alerted the officer to Mr. Reid's presence on the "hot list," including toll pass readers and automated license plate readers, which Atlanta has in the hundreds on roads and police vehicles. (A spokesman for the DeKalb County police said a license plate reader was not used.)
"There's a lot of secrecy about all of these surveillance technologies and the ways that they're used," Ms. Kleinman said. "This case is a perfect example that even when the tool works as intended, if the underlying data is flawed it can still harm innocent people."
Not Involved
Mr. Reid sat in DeKalb County jail for nearly a week. He could not be released on bond because he was supposed to be held until Louisiana officers came to pick him up for prosecution in their state. His Jeep was towed and impounded.
"Imagine you're living your life and somewhere far away says you committed a crime," Mr. Reid said. "And you know you've never been there."
His lawyer, Mr. Calogero, gathered photos and videos of Mr. Reid from his family, hoping to more clearly show the Louisiana police what Mr. Reid looks like, and sent them to the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office on Wednesday, Nov. 30, five days after the arrest. An hour later, Mr. Calogero said, an officer called to inform him that the police were withdrawing the warrant because they had noticed a mole on Mr. Reid's face that the alleged purse thief did not have.
Mr. Reid's detainment was "unfortunate by all means," Sheriff Joseph P. Lopinto III of Jefferson Parish said. "As soon as we realized it wasn't him, we moved mountains in order to get him out of jail."
A Jefferson Parish judge recalled the warrant on Wednesday afternoon. "After further investigation, it was learned Randal Reid was not involved in the crimes committed," the recall said. Mr. Reid was released late Thursday night, almost a full week after being pulled over. He is considering filing a wrongful-arrest lawsuit.
"Thousands of dollars for something I didn't do," he said.
Mr. Robinson, the Color of Change president, said most people in the United States did not have thousands of dollars to clear their names. These people will have "names and stories we will never know," he said. "They will languish in jails and prisons."

Full text: Cherry blossoms in Tokyo, wildflowers in the Hudson Valley, breezy rooftop views in Paris: Here's where to check in for a spring getaway.
You may still be wearing a coat, but spring is around the corner, and whether you're dreaming of blossoms or baseball, it's time to make reservations. With gardens, trails and enchanting views, these hotels make it a breeze to participate in beloved springtime traditions. From about $ 100 to more than $ 1,000 a night, they just might inspire you to celebrate cherry blossom season in Japan, feed chickens in the Hudson Valley or sip a cocktail in Paris on some of the city's newest hotel rooftops.
Washington
Pendry Washington DC -- the Wharf
What began in the early 1900s as a gift of thousands of Japanese cherry trees to the United States from Japan has become an annual tradition: Each spring, the U.S. capital is awash in pink and white blossoms -- and people show up in droves to delight in them. The Tidal Basin has long been the go-to spot for viewing. If you want to be within walking distance of the basin as well as some of the city's latest alfresco spots to eat, drink and enjoy live music, the Wharf -- the nascent neighborhood with a promenade along the Washington Channel -- is the place to be. It has views of the blossoming Kwanzan cherry trees in East Potomac Park and you can choose from hotel brands like Hyatt House, Canopy by Hilton and the InterContinental. In late October, Pendry Washington DC -- the Wharf opened in a glass building with 131 rooms and suites, adding a bit of splash to the waterfront.
You can take in the view across the channel while sampling Japanese whiskey, sushi and treats like Tokyo fried chicken at the hotel's rooftop bar and lounge, Moonraker. (For Latin American-inspired small plates, check out the Flora Flora restaurant.) Guests may also find themselves in the middle of the action for the Wharf's annual Bloomaroo (April 1), a free spring festival with activities and events including koi kite decorating, face painting, music, beer gardens and pink fireworks. To get a closer look at the Kwanzan trees, hop on the free Wharf Jitney ferry to East Potomac Park. To see the trees around the Tidal Basin, simply go for a 20-minute stroll.
The citywide National Cherry Blossom Festival offers events and activities from March 18 through April 16, including the Sakura Matsuri -- Japanese Street Festival, which describes itself as "the largest celebration of Japanese culture in the United States." Back at the Pendry, you can stop at the Bar Pendry in the lobby for a cocktail, or head to Moonraker to watch night settle over the river in the distance. Rooms from $ 355 a night.
Paris
Hôtel Madame Rêve
Few cities can rival the romance of Paris in springtime. And in the first arrondissement, amid tulips and sidewalk cafes, the Hôtel Madame Rêve is a buzzy perch from which to take it all in. Situated in the 19th-century Louvre post office building, the hotel, which has 82 rooms and suites, is a short walk from the Jardin des Tuileries. Madame Rêve, however, has plenty of its own greenery. At ROOF, its sprawling 1,000-square-meter (about 10,764 square feet) rooftop bar, there are plants, trees, cocktails, finger food and striking views of the city. For Japanese-influenced cuisine, there's La Plume Rive Droite, which opens onto a patio with dozens of species of plants. There's also the elegant Madame Rêve Café for Mediterranean-style food, which, on a sunny spring day, can be enjoyed on the terrace. Rooms from 500 euros, or about $ 532, a night.
TOO Hotel
Laurent Taïeb, the restaurateur and hotelier who founded Hôtel Madame Rêve, is also behind TOO Hotel, which opened in October atop one of the Tours Duo skyscrapers designed by Jean Nouvel. At the edge of Paris in the 13th arrondissement, it's near the Seine, within walking distance of the Jardin des Plantes, and about a 15- to 20-minute drive from the Paris-Orly Airport. That location enables the hotel to provide the sorts of panoramic views more often associated with properties in cities like New York and Shanghai. Its 139 rooms and suites, designed by Philippe Starck, all have city vistas. And like Madame Rêve, it has an intriguing new rooftop destination: TOO TacTac Skybar. There are also postcard views from TOO Restaurant, where you can try dishes from around the world, be it shakshuka or lobster tempura. And the spa has an outdoor hot tub on a terrace with plants, trees and views over the Seine. Happily, the only thing that's not sky-high is the starting room rate. Rooms from 220 euros a night.
Hudson Valley, N.Y.
Wildflower Farms
For those who want to experience spring unfolding on a farm but also want a spa, a sommelier and perhaps some custom cedar-scented soaps, there's Wildflower Farms, Auberge Resorts Collection, a new 140-acre luxury retreat with 65 cabins, cottages and suites in Gardiner, N.Y. The resort, about an hour and a half from New York City, allows guests to embrace spring amid grasses and wildflowers, and on its three miles of trails. (The nearby Mohonk Preserve provides additional opportunities for hiking and rock climbing.) Wildflower Farms also offers activities and classes inspired by nature, such as pressed-flower pottery, flower arranging, foraging and botanical baking. You can feed the chickens and, if you like, collect the day's eggs. Go for a dip in the outdoor pool (or simply visit the bar alongside it), try the spa (there are outdoor hot tubs and an indoor saltwater pool) and work out at the open-air fitness center.
When you retire to your room, you won't lose sight of the area's beauty. The cabins and cottages have wall-to-wall glass sliding doors, providing guests with "in-bed vistas," as well as large private terraces with daybeds. Ridge suites have two fireplaces, a terrace with a cedar hot tub, indoor and outdoor showers, and of course, views of the Shawangunk Ridge, better known as the Gunks. When you get hungry, there's New American fare at the restaurant, Clay. Morning coffee, pastries, snacks and cocktails can be had at the main building on the open-air Great Porch, where you can sink into a velvet couch beside a fire and gaze at the mountains. Rooms from $ 1,000 a night.
Atlanta
Omni Hotel at the Battery Atlanta
Yet another rite of spring, Major League Baseball season, is almost here. And for those who wish to turn a game into a weekend getaway, there are hotels such as the 264-room-and-suite Omni Hotel at the Battery Atlanta, just a few hundred feet from Truist Park, the home of the Atlanta Braves. The Premier, Executive and Luxury rooms (the latter have private terraces with fire pits, sofas and tables) feature various views of the stadium or field, and their red and white touches are a nod to baseball.
Traveling with someone who's not a fan? Your companion can stroll the surrounding area, known as the Battery Atlanta, where there are places to grab a bite, like Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams and Antico Pizza Napoletana, as well as live music at Coca-Cola Roxy and movies at Silverspot Cinema.
Rooms at the Omni Hotel start at $ 274 a night. You can also add a baseball package that includes valet parking, breakfast, nightly children's turndown service with milk and cookies, and tickets for a tour of Truist Park.
Tokyo and southern Japan
Fairfield by Marriott's Michi-no-Eki hotels
What better way to celebrate Japan's reopening after being closed to much of the world at the height of the pandemic than with a cherry blossom road trip -- and new hotels to check into along the way?
Seven Fairfield by Marriott hotels are opening this year in the prefectures of Hyogo, Kagoshima, Okayama, Saga, Kumamoto and Fukuoka as part of Marriott's ongoing Michi-no-Eki project. Located in rural places near roadside rest areas (known in Japan as Michi-no-Eki), the hotels are often close to national parks and cultural sites. They offer affordable rooms, from about 225 to 270 square feet, with free Wi-Fi. Several opened in places such as Hokkaido and Nara, and in January, the 88-room Fairfield by Marriott Hyogo Tajima Yabu opened in Yabu, a city in Hyogo prefecture, which is home to Mount Hyonosen, Tendaki Falls and Tarumi-no-Ozakura, a cherry tree said to be more than 1,000 years old.
This spring, more Michi-no-Eki hotels are on the way. The 78-room Fairfield by Marriott Okayama Tsuyama is scheduled to open on April 11 in Okayama, an easy drive to the ruins of Tsuyama Castle in Kakuzan Park, a prime cherry blossom viewing spot. And the 95-room Fairfield by Marriott Kagoshima Tarumizu is set to open on April 12 in Kagoshima, where you can visit the (recently active) Sakurajima volcano; check out sites from Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution, which are on UNESCO's World Heritage List; and if you have time, make the ferry trip to Yakushima Island to visit the cedar forests, thought to have inspired the Studio Ghibli film "Princess Mononoke." All three properties have rooms from 13,000 yen, or about $ 96, a night.
Bulgari Hotel Tokyo
On April 4, the 98-room-and-suite Bulgari Hotel Tokyo is scheduled to open in the capital, bringing Italian design to the top of the Tokyo Midtown Yaesu skyscraper. Guests will be within walking distance of the Imperial Palace, one of the most popular spots in Tokyo for enjoying cherry blossoms. A longer walk will bring you to yet another beloved blossom destination, the Chidori-ga-fuchi Moat. For sweeping views of the city and, on a clear day, Mount Fuji, head to the Bulgari Bar, which will have terraces on the 45th floor. The hotel will also have a spa (with an indoor pool), a fitness center and restaurants featuring Japanese and Italian culinary traditions: Sushi Hoseki by Kenji Gyoten and Il Ristorante by Niko Romito. Should you wish to go farther afield, you're a two-minute walk from Tokyo Station, making it easy to board a train and explore other parts of Japan. Prices from 250,000 yen.

Ivan Bart Changed the Notion of What's Beautiful: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ivan Bart, who helped kick-start the careers of some of today's most recognizable models, has left his role as president of the agency IMG Models.
On the April cover of British Vogue, three models wearing dresses that hug their hourglass figures are described by three words: "The New Supers."
Those models -- Jill Kortleve, Precious Lee and Paloma Elsesser -- are represented by IMG Models, an agency that also represents Gigi and Bella Hadid. The models on the cover of British Vogue, all of whose careers may have once been hindered because they are not size zero, represent the agency's efforts to redefine who a supermodel can be.
Ivan Bart, 59, the president of IMG Models, has been an important part of those efforts. On Friday, he left that position for a role as senior adviser at the agency, according to a news release sent by its parent company, Endeavor.
"Ivan has quite literally changed the shape and face of the modeling industry," Mark Shapiro, the president of Endeavor, wrote in a statement to The New York Times. "We are honored that we will still continue to benefit from his vision in this next chapter."
Mr. Bart, who has worked at IMG Models for three decades, will not be replaced by another president. His departure is part of a series of organizational changes at Endeavor, which last year hired Susan Plagemann, a former chief business officer at Condé Nast, to run a newly formed division called WME Fashion. IMG Models, now part of that division, will be led by Jeni Rose and Kate Stirling.
Mr. Bart said that as part of his new role, he will continue to identify new models. "I want to keep finding great talent," he said.
More models these days can be short or curvy or middle-aged, and they can emerge from social media or reality television. Scouting talent has always been a part of the business, but when Mr. Bart came to IMG from Ford Models as an agent, in 1994, the industry was less inclusive.
In his early years at the agency, Mr. Bart worked with some of the most sought-after models at the time, including Carolyn Murphy and Stephanie Seymour. Though Mr. Bart was young, he was "a big thinker," Ms. Seymour said. "He had ambition for the girls."
"He was also incredibly personable," she added. "Someone you could trust, someone you could ask their opinion or tell a secret to."
Kyle Hagler, who worked at IMG Models from 1996 to 2014, said that Mr. Bart also took an interest in progressive causes within the industry. Mr. Hagler recalled how Mr. Bart attended a 2007 news conference hosted by Bethann Hardison, a former model and an agent, to call attention to the lack of racial diversity on runways and in advertising.
Ms. Hardison, who has also worked as a casting director, described Mr. Bart as "someone who always cared about the issues that I cared about."
In 2009, Chuck Bennett, then the president of IMG Models, left the agency. Mr. Bart was named its director, essentially replacing Mr. Bennett.
The model Martha Hunt, who had mostly posed for catalogs when she was introduced to Mr. Bart in 2012, said that meeting with him changed everything for her. "I went from doing catalog work to, overnight, walking for Prada and Chanel," Ms. Hunt said.
When IMG Models signed Gigi Hadid, in 2012, she was arguably best known for appearing on TV alongside her mother, who was then a star of "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills." Mr. Bart made some of her early introductions to fashion world players, including the editor Carine Roitfeld, whose magazine CR Fashion Book featured Gigi Hadid in 2014.
Mr. Bart was named president of IMG Models in 2014, after the agency was acquired by the entertainment conglomerate that owns WME. That year, after the closure of the plus-size division at Ford Models, IMG signed Ashley Graham and other plus-size models who had been dropped by Ford.
In 2017, Ms. Graham became the first plus-size model to appear on the covers of British Vogue and American Vogue. In 2018, she became a face of Revlon.
"Being the president of an agency that sells beauty is a tricky thing in these times, when beauty is loaded with political meaning and values," said Linda Wells, a former editor in chief of Allure, who was the chief creative officer at Revlon when the brand signed the deal with Ms. Graham. "It requires a different vision and awareness. Ivan really pushed that, and pushed that in a forceful way."
Mr. Bart further expanded the notion of who can be a model by supporting the careers of transgender models such as Hari Nef, who signed with IMG in 2015, and of Maye Musk, the mother of Elon Musk, who was 68 when she signed with the agency in 2016. Mr. Bart also gave his stamp of approval to Ella Emhoff, the stepdaughter of Vice President Kamala Harris, who signed with the agency a week after she attended President Biden's inauguration in 2021.

Full text: Developed by a team of Broadway and Hollywood all-stars, the new Hulu series sets a chorus of inner critics to song.
The rats were not on the call sheet. They turned up anyway.
For the members of the brain trust behind the new Hulu musical series "Up Here," this balmy September night last year was to be a precious occasion: After more than two years of cross-country video calls, the writer and executive producer Danielle Sanchez-Witzel had flown in from Los Angeles during the last full week of production, finally giving her a chance to hang out on set with her collaborators -- a gang of Broadway powerhouses that included the highly decorated songwriting couple behind "Frozen," Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez.
"She was one of our best friends in the pandemic," Anderson-Lopez said at the time, at an outdoor shoot in the Manhattan neighborhood of Hudson Heights. "We spent six to eight hours together a day during 2021. And we just hugged in person for the first time 10 minutes ago."
And then Sanchez-Witzel got a dose of New York City realness. As they gathered around the monitors, with the cameras rolling just a few yards away, a few enterprising rodents decided to join the fun. Snacks were stashed. Sanchez-Witzel nervously pulled up her feet. Someone joked about creating a viral video to promote the show.
It was just the latest twist in the bigger challenge faced by the illustrious team behind "Up Here," which dropped all eight episodes of its first season on Friday: how to merge that most classically New York of art forms, the stage musical, with a much younger Hollywood one -- the bingeable half-hour streaming sitcom.
Stage musicals have been adapted into movies for decades; live television adaptations have made a comeback in recent years, too. But turning one into serialized television is new. This alone would make "Up Here," developed from an original musical by the Lopezes, stand out.
Add to that the Tony-winning creative powers of the writer Steven Levenson ("Dear Evan Hansen") and the director Thomas Kail ("Hamilton"), and the series also comes courtesy of Broadway's equivalent to a Marvel superteam.
"I think they wanted to make sure someone hadn't won a Tony in this group," Sanchez-Witzel said. (She, Levenson and the Lopezes are all credited as developers.) She joked that over the years she had spent "thousands of dollars on StubHub" to watch her new collaborators' shows.
Given the surrealistic premise of "Up Here," it was perhaps always well suited for the screen -- think "Herman's Head" with music, or "Inside Out" with nagging parents, mean ex-crushes and former friends instead of lovable little gremlins. Set at the turn of the millennium, it centers on Lindsay and Miguel (played in the series by Mae Whitman and Carlos Valdes), a young couple who meet outside a bar bathroom where Lindsay's roommate is having sex with a stranger.
If a show about the lurid dating lives of 20-something New Yorkers feels a little familiar, the twist is that the characters' thoughts, as personified by people from their lives, constantly speak up -- or, rather, sing up -- to interfere.
The original musical premiered in San Diego in 2015, then was shelved while the Lopezes worked on other things. It didn't stay on the shelf for long. Early in 2020, Kail, who since directing "Hamilton" had begun to develop a solid reputation in television (he was an executive producer and director of the acclaimed FX series "Fosse/Verdon"), was looking for a new project he could sink his teeth into. He knew the Lopezes from the theater world -- in addition to their songs for the "Frozen" movies and "Coco," Lopez had co-written "Avenue Q" and "The Book of Mormon" -- and he asked if they had anything lying around.
They were keen to take another crack at "Up Here." Kail saw potential. He soon pulled in Levenson, his fellow developer of "Fosse/Verdon." All agreed that "Up Here" would work best as a comedy series. There was just one problem.
"We quickly decided none of us had any experience in half-hour television," Levenson said. So Kail contacted Sanchez-Witzel, whose credits included "The Carmichael Show" and "New Girl." She signed on but continued to work from Los Angeles. (Kail, the Lopezes and Levenson are also executive producers.)
The team's central task was figuring out how to translate the stage version to episodic television. The idea, as Levenson explained it, was to create a musical that spanned eight episodes but where each was also its own mini-musical. And the tunes had to be more than an accessory.
"The show needed to function like a musical, where the songs actually were necessary to the storytelling, so that if you removed them, the show wouldn't work," Levenson said.
The learning curve was steep for both sides.
"Danielle told us about certain structures of a 30-minute comedy," Anderson-Lopez said. "And we talked a lot about how when we're looking for songs in theater or animated musicals, we're always looking for a moment when a character is having a feeling so big, they can't speak anymore. It was really fun figuring out those spaces in a half-hour comedy."
Eventually, the set list from the San Diego production was almost entirely put aside. The male lead's name was also changed from Dan to Miguel.
"I felt strongly that this time around he should be not white," said Lopez, the youngest person ever to win an EGOT -- an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony -- and also the only person to have won each award more than once. He and Sanchez-Witzel share "a similar experience being nonwhite and feeling disconnected from both the white mainstream and from our immigrant histories," he added. (Lopez is of Philippine descent; Sanchez-Witzel is Mexican American.) "We thought that'd be interesting to put into this character."
To find their lead actors, the New York-based creators followed a procedure they were all familiar with. This was an advantage for Valdes.
"I got there, and with the accompanist and the music, I was like, 'Oh, this is like a theater audition,"' said Valdes, who is best known for playing Cisco/Vibe on the CW's "The Flash" but has extensive show-tune experience, including appearing in the Broadway hit "Once" a decade ago.
"It had been a long time since I'd been in that kind of musical theater space, but it felt so familiar," he said, "like a homecoming."
Landing the part was more fraught for Whitman, whose extensive television résumé ("Parenthood," "Arrested Development") had not prepared her for an old-school tryout. "I had to fly to New York and stand in front of a table full of people next to a piano player and have to sing," Whitman said in a joint video call with Valdes. "It was terrifying. I can sing, but I'd never done anything like that."
As for the actors handling Lindsay and Miguel's inner voices, they tend to straddle both worlds. Portraying Lindsay's parents are the writer, humorist and actor John Hodgman and the Broadway and "Brockmire" veteran Katie Finneran. Team Miguel includes Scott Porter, an original cast member of the Off Broadway hit musical "Altar Boyz" who went on to star in "Friday Night Lights." That evening in Hudson Heights, he was rocking a goatee and suspenders that made him look like a cocky late-90s corporate bro, which is exactly what he plays.
From his experience in theater and on "Fosse/Verdon," Kail had learned that things went smoother if you had everyone in the same building; aside from the portions shot on location, the entire production was concentrated at a compound in Long Island City, Queens, from the writing to the choreography to the costume making.
"The thing with theater is, there is a moment when you move into the theater and everybody's under the same tent," he said. "We wanted to try to do that here and bring everybody in."
Except, of course, for Sanchez-Witzel, who until the final full week had to make do from Los Angeles. It was great that technology had allowed her to observe the set from 3,000 miles away, she said, but she couldn't deny the thrill of finally watching it all in person: the strips of ratty off-white carpet evoking dirty Manhattan snow, the whispers between takes, the in-person chemistry between Whitman and Valdes.
Then there was the massive boulder in the middle of a block in Hudson Heights, where Lindsay and Miguel share an important kiss.
"To see the rock in person -- it's probably hard for you to imagine how exciting it is," Sanchez-Witzel said, laughing. "But to me, it's extremely exciting!"

We Need to Talk. But First I'll Consult a Chat Bot.: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Faced with challenging situations in parenting, romance or work, some are getting by with a little help from their A.I. friends.
Todd Mitchem kept struggling to have honest, productive conversations with his son. "He's 15," Mr. Mitchem, 52, said with a laugh. "Teenagers are so difficult to connect with."
Every time he tried to bring up a sensitive issue, his son would give vague answers or run away, preferring to avoid serious talks altogether.
In the past when Mr. Mitchem needed parenting help, he would read a book or pose a question to the men's support group he meets with weekly.
But recently he has turned to ChatGPT. And he's not alone: Others are turning to artificial intelligence chat bots to figure out what to say in situations that feel high-stakes. They are using the tool to talk or read to their children, to approach bosses, to provide difficult feedback, to write wedding vows or to pen love letters.
Unlike turning to friends or even professionals for help, the bot, said Mr. Mitchem, gives what feels like objective advice. "The bot is giving me responses based on analysis and data, not human emotions," he said.
ChatGPT, the new virtual tool powered by Open AI, sources its information from a wide range of online material including books, news articles, scientific journals, websites and even message boards, allowing users to have humanlike conversions with a chat bot.
"It's giving you what the collective hive mind on the internet would say," said Irina Raicu, who directs the internet ethics program at Santa Clara University. (Other companies including Google and Microsoft have their own versions of this technology, and Microsoft's, called Bing A.I., was recently made famous for aggressively declaring its love to the New York Times journalist Kevin Roose.)
Mr. Mitchem, who lives in Denver and is the executive vice president of learning and product for a leadership training company, opened his conversation by typing, in summary: "I need some friendly advice."
"OK, no problem," ChatGPT responded, according to Mr. Mitchem. "What is your name?"
In the course of their conversation, ChatGPT told Mr. Mitchem that he is a good father for even wondering how to approach a conversation with his son about the decision to join a basketball team. "It said something like, 'It's cool if you don't get it right, but it's awesome that you are trying."
Mr. Mitchem said the bot then continued: "Teenage boys, when they are growing up, are trying to force their independence. Remember when you talk to him, he needs to know that you trust your decisions."
The next day Mr. Mitchem approached his son and tried out the advice. "I said to him, 'You need to make this decision, you are 14, and I trust you will make a good one," Mr. Mitchem said. "My son goes, 'Wow, that's awesome. I'll let you know what I decide."'
"We left on a positive note," Mr. Mitchem said. "It totally worked." Once Upon a Time ...
For Naif Alanazi, a 35-year-old Ph.D. student at Kent State University, bedtime is a sacred ritual for him and his 4-year-old daughter, Yasmeen. "I have to work all day," he said. "This is our special time."
His Saudi Arabian family has a deep tradition of telling oral stories. Wanting to continue it, he used to try to concoct new, thrilling tales each evening. "Do you know how difficult it is to come up with something new every day?" he asked, laughing.
Now, however, he lets the bot do the work.
Every night he asks ChatGPT to create a story that involves people (his daughter's teacher, for instance) and places (school, the park) from her day, along with a cliffhanger at the end so he continue the story the next night. "Sometimes I ask it to add a value she needs to learn like honesty or being kind to others," he said.
"Being able to give her something that is more than a generic story, something that can increase our bond and show her that I am interested in her daily life," he said, "it makes me feel so much closer to her."
Love Languages
Anifa Musengimana, 25, who is in graduate school for international marketing in London, is certain that chat bots can help make the tedium of online dating more interesting. "I am having a lot of repetitive conversations on these apps," she said. "The app can give me fun ideas of what to talk about, and maybe I'll find better people to date."
"If I get intriguing answers, I will be drawn in," she said.
She said she would tell her match she was using the tool. "I would want a guy who finds it funny," she said. "I wouldn't want a guy who is so serious that he gets mad at me for doing it."
Some are using chat bots to enhance the relationships they already have.
James Gregson, 40, a creative director who lives in Avon, Conn., has been using ChatGPT to draft love letters to his wife.
"I am not a poet, I am not a songwriter, but I can take topics on things my wife might like and put it into a song or poem," he said.
He also believes in full disclosure: "I am going to give her one, but I am going to tell her who wrote it," he said. "I am not trying to con her." Office Applications
Jessica Massey, 29, a finance analyst at Cisco Systems, who lives in Buffalo, has been writing draft emails to her boss using ChatGPT. "I wanted to test out its capabilities to see if there was a different way A.I. would word what I was thinking in my head," she wrote in an email. (One person interviewed confessed to consulting ChatGPT to help prepare for their interview for this story. Another admitted to using it for employee reviews.)
Ms. Massey used the bot to write an email to her boss explaining why the company should pay for a certain professional certification. The bot gave her pretty boilerplate language, she said. She hasn't sent it yet, but plans to once she changes "the verbiage a bit to make it sound more like me."
Ms. Massey, however, has a rule about relying on a chat bot: "Disclose it at the end of your work or not use it at all."
However, scholars who study technology and ethics have mixed feelings about using ChatGPT for highly personal communication.
"We shouldn't automatically reject tools that might help people deal with a difficult conversation," said Michael Zimmer, the director of the Center for Data, Ethics and Society at Marquette University. He equates it to buying a Hallmark Card for a birthday or anniversary. "We've all accepted doing that because the words on the card align with something I believe," he said. However, Ms. Raicu, from Santa Clara University, worries about people using ChatGPT for personal communication. She doesn't like the idea that there is a "right" and "wrong" way to communicate. "I think the right words depend on who the people are who are communicating and the context," she said. "There is no formula for a lot of this stuff."
Ms. Raicu said that using ChatGPT for personal communication may undermine trust: "People might ask, 'Do I really know who I am talking to?"'

Coach Provides the Yin To Auriemma's Yang, And Some Levity, Too: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Assistant coaches usually move on after a few seasons. Not Dailey, Connecticut's associate head coach, who sticks to a routine and brings balance to the bench.
STORRS, Conn. -- Chris Dailey is a woman of routine.
She runs practices like clockwork. She delivers her locker room pep talks with efficiency. And she adheres to a strict schedule in the morning before heading to the University of Connecticut: She gets up, works out and goes to Panera Bread.
"It's a little embarrassing -- I used to get their iced tea but I don't really like it, so now I make my own and I just go there because I like their cups, and I have people there that I talk to," Dailey, 63, said recently, adding in a near-whisper: "I really just get the ice there."
On game days, the coach whom players call "C.D." fills her cup with a special treat: Diet Coke. She'll bring it with her onto the court and tape over the brand's name "so we don't get in trouble," she said.
For 38 years, Dailey's routines have kept the Connecticut women's basketball program running at full steam. She is the yin to Coach Geno Auriemma's yang, the steady voice to his occasional courtside outbursts, the structure to his more fluid approach. The two couldn't be more different -- he arrives five minutes before a plane is scheduled to take off, she prefers not to travel with him anymore -- but together, they have transformed the Connecticut program, and with it, women's basketball at large.
"The way that we are, the one unit that we are, that's all C.D.," said the sophomore guard Caroline Ducharme. "She's the leader in that and I think a big reason that UConn has the image that it has."
Auriemma hired Dailey as an assistant coach in 1985, as soon as he arrived in Storrs, and promoted her to associate head coach in 1988, a role she has filled ever since, with a focus on post players, academics and overall recruitment. Together, Auriemma and Dailey have coached more than 40 all-American players, reached 22 Final Fours, won 11 championships, recorded six perfect seasons (including an 111-game winning streak) and sent nearly 40 women to the W.N.B.A., including Rebecca Lobo, Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, Breanna Stewart, Swin Cash and Maya Moore.
The numbers can be dizzying.
"When I hear the numbers, I think, that's unbelievable, and if I didn't live it, I might not believe it," Dailey said.
On Saturday, Connecticut will make its 29th consecutive appearance in the N.C.A.A. tournament's round of 16 after one of the most difficult seasons in program history. Injuries, illness and missed games -- including by Auriemma and Dailey -- followed the Huskies all year, right up to their Big East tournament title earlier this month. Dailey herself was taken off the court in a stretcher after collapsing during a game in November.
"We tell the kids, there are no bad teams left, only good teams are remaining, and we have to play well in order to advance," Dailey said. "If we do that, then we give ourselves a chance."
Dailey has been part of a "good team" for longer than many of her players have been alive. She played basketball in high school in New Brunswick, N.J., and then at Rutgers, where she won a national championship. She went on to coach as an assistant at Cornell and Rutgers before arriving at Connecticut.
But the Auriemma-Dailey team was never a sure thing. In fact, Dailey didn't know if she would make it through the first summer training camp. But, a decade in, they won their first championship title, defeating the Tennessee Lady Vols in 1995. A new chapter in women's basketball was born.
After the Huskies' win, Mickie DeMoss, a friend and assistant coach for Tennessee, pulled Dailey aside to tell her that Tennessee would have to start playing basketball differently now.
"I said to Geno, 'You're not going to believe this -- Tennessee is going to change their style of play because of us,"' Dailey said. "We didn't want to be just a one-hit wonder. That next year, I felt more pressure in terms of recruiting and wanting to win. We wanted to sustain it."
Dailey said Auriemma absorbs that pressure on behalf of the team. She tries to add a bit of levity where she can; jokes and sarcasm run deep on the coaching bench, especially among basketball's odd couple.
"C.D. is definitely always taking care of us, making activities for us, taking us to pedicures," said Dorka Juhász, a forward who transferred to Connecticut from Ohio State. "We're college kids, we're doing a lot of basketball, but also, you know, she's trying to balance it to see the world a little bit."
That balance sometimes swings the other way.
Asjha Jones, who played at UConn from 1998 through 2002, with the likes of Bird and Cash, remembered one particularly grueling practice after "a bunch of us kept mishandling the ball." Dailey lined up her post players and started throwing "bullets at us, throwing them to the sky, drilling at us," Jones said. "She takes it personally, we're a reflection of her.
"Looking back, you're like, damn," Jones continued with a laugh. "But guess what: We didn't drop any more passes that year."
Dailey recruited Jones out of high school, and the two New Jersey natives hit it off immediately.
"She was one of the few people who understood me and knew how to talk to me," said Jones, a two-time W.N.B.A. All-Star who is now the director of basketball strategy for the Portland Trail Blazers. "She didn't sugarcoat anything, didn't give me any fluff."
Dailey and Auriemma have fallen into what Dailey calls a "divorced parents" rhythm. If a player doesn't receive the answer they're looking for from one of them, they'll go to the other coach. But one thing is consistent: They both hold themselves and the Huskies program to a high standard.
"I've always appreciated the fact that he's allowed me ownership of this program and appreciated how he gets to his spot," Dailey said of Auriemma.
Auriemma, for his part, knows his team is in good hands.
"It's unique that she's able to spend that much time here and be able to put her stamp on the program in every way," he said, adding that, if he left for the summer, the team would be better organized and "things would be in a much better place if she was in charge."
Dailey, who was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018, knows that she is "closer to the end than I am to the beginning," but she's not done with her routines yet. Maybe that's when everything that the program has accomplished will sink in.
"I don't think you ever really think about legacy until it's over," she said. "I don't think I will think about that until I'm retired -- and I still have a few good years left in me."
Auriemma and Dailey will both know when it's time, "whether it's together or separate -- we're certainly not twins," Dailey said. "It would be in some ways fitting for us to leave together, but we're certainly two individuals that have our own minds and situations."
Dailey was hesitant to say whether she would step into the role if Auriemma were to step down first -- "I don't think about that other stuff" -- but said she didn't see that happening.
"Circumstances have a lot to do with a lot of things," she said. "Right now, we're excited about the future."

Hotels Absorb Migrant Influx (And Bill City): [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The city has spent millions to convert upscale hotels, humble motels and even office buildings into housing for an influx of migrants.
Just steps from Times Square and surrounded by Broadway theaters, the Row NYC hotel advertises itself as "more New York than New York," bringing together "urban grit with grandeur."
But for months, it has been at the center of a humanitarian crisis.
It is one of about 100 hotels and other facilities, from iconic skyscrapers to humble airport motels, that the city has converted into temporary housing for some of the 50,000 migrants who have arrived on buses from the southern border since last spring. The effort may ultimately cost as much as $ 4 billion over the next two years and could result in cuts to city services, the mayor has warned. For migrants, the housing, while at times imperfect, has provided welcome respite as they begin to eke out new lives in a frenetic city.
And it has been something of a boon for hotels, which have suffered as the city tries to boost its economy as it emerges from the pandemic. Contracts obtained through Freedom of Information Law requests and a recent report from the office of Comptroller Brad Lander provide new insight into how hotel and even office building owners stand to profit from the conversions.
In October, the city signed a $ 40 million contract to buy out the 1,300-room Row until mid-April; it was the first of several Midtown hotels that now solely house migrant families. On a recent afternoon, parents and children milled about at the entrance on Eighth Avenue.
Margarita Buenaño, 43, from Ecuador, was among those outside. She is living in the Row with her 10-year-old son, and has picked up work as a house cleaner. Like thousands of others, they had trekked through the perilous Darién Gap, the jungle that connects Colombia and Panama, and kept going north until they reached Texas. Asked if the risk had been worth it, she paused.
"It's going to be worth it," she said. "We're fighting for our dreams."
A new type of shelter
The majority of shelter operations in hotels around the city are run by nonprofits contracted by the Department of Homeless Services. But a handful of the newest ones, including four in Midtown, are being run directly by the public health care system, NYC Health & Hospitals, with support from the city's Emergency Management office and other agencies.
The nine facilities, known as Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Centers, or HERRCs, are more expensive to operate than normal shelters because of how quickly they had to be set up and the services they offer.
They offer on-site medical screenings, counseling and help setting up travel to other destinations. The mayor ordered their creation when he declared a state of emergency in October, arguing that the sudden arrival of so many people constituted an unprecedented crisis.
At one point, the emergency shelters included barracks-style tents set up at Randalls Island and a cruise terminal in Red Hook, closing this month. The shelters evoked protest from elected officials and advocates who said moving migrants around was "callous," and said the city should use hotels, rather than makeshift structures in remote, flood-prone locations. Those facilities housed adult men, while families were put into hotel rooms.
From a cruise terminal to office buildings
The city has gotten creative as it tries to find space to house the migrants. It signed a $ 3.2 million contract in January to start using the cruise terminal with its operator, Ports America, to house migrants. The terminal will revert to its original use as the summer travel season begins.
Two new shelters are set to open in April and will take in the men who had been living in the cruise terminal, which held 1,000 cots.
One of the new shelters will be in an office building at 455 Jefferson Street, on the border of Bushwick and East Williamsburg, billed as "inspirational office space," under a contract for roughly $ 360,000 a month. It is slated to have 400 cots and space for medical and legal services and a cafeteria.
Another converted office will be in Times Square, in the Candler Building, an architecturally significant skyscraper built in the early 1900s by the founder of the Coca-Cola Company. Until the pandemic, the building housed a McDonald's. The cost of that contract has not been disclosed.
Michael Chukwuemeka, 30, a Nigerian asylum seeker living in the cruise terminal, said that he was among 250 men who would be moving to the Candler Building in the coming days. He was relieved to find out he was going to Times Square, the center of it all, a contrast with the industrial Brooklyn waterfront.
"I'm so excited," he said as he rode the bus back to Red Hook after job-searching on Wednesday. "It's a better place than before."
Both the Candler Building and the Watson Hotel on West 57th Street, another emergency shelter where migrants camped out to protest being moved to the cruise terminal earlier this year, are owned by the private equity firm Yellowstone.
A web of contracts
A full accounting of the myriad costs associated with housing migrants and providing them with services has not yet been released by the city, and the hotel room rates are redacted from most publicly released contracts. But the information that has been disclosed helps explain how the price tag climbed into the billions so quickly.
Many of the hotel rooms are being paid for through a bulk contract with the Hotel Association of New York City Foundation, which signed a $ 237 million deal that began in September. Hotels were hard-hit during the pandemic as tourism ground to a halt; visitors are returning, but occupancy rates are still down 10 percent from 2019, according to a January report from the hospitality data firm STR.
A separate contract, to buy out the 611-room Stewart Hotel next to Madison Square Garden, listed a room rate of $ 200 a night for its use as a shelter. Once all the rooms are available, the monthly payment would be an estimated $ 3.6 million.
The contract includes requirements like daily room cleaning, fresh linens and towels once a week or as needed, and monthly exterminators.
The hotels appear to employ the same staff, though they have been joined at times by social workers, translators and National Guard members. Row is listed as a union facility on the hotel association's site, and Rich Maroko, president of the Hotel & Gaming Trades Council, was among the officials who hailed the announcement that it would be used as a migrant shelter.
"As a union representing thousands of immigrants who provide professional hospitality to New York's visitors, we stand ready to help in any way we can," he said in a statement sent out by City Hall in October.
The hotel operators did not respond to requests for comment.
There are contracts with food vendors to provide meals, since the hotels generally do not have kitchens and devices like rice cookers are prohibited. An agreement with LIC COM that started in October says the company will deliver a "culturally appropriate Latin-centric menu with variety throughout the week" to the Row, the Watson and another shelter at the Hotel Wolcott. The cost was $ 25 to $ 35 per person each day.
Texas companies are key
Two of the vendors contracted to set up emergency shelters were SLSCO and Garner Environmental Services, both Texas-based disaster relief companies. SLSCO was given a contract for $ 135 million starting in November; Garner was given a $ 30 million contract.
Critics of the city's response see irony here, since it was the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, who began busing migrants to northern cities last year to make a political statement. SLSCO also made headlines for its role building the border wall in its home state -- and because the family behind it has supported Mr. Abbott, as well as Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.
The company had previously been contracted by New York Emergency Management to construct a Covid field hospital that saw few patients, and to manage vaccination sites. An audit by Mr. Lander's office regarding the vaccination sites last year found that double billing and errors had led to tens of thousands of dollars in overpayments.
Mayor Eric Adams has warned that the city cannot afford what he has called an "unbelievable strain," but he has also stressed that New York will continue to welcome newcomers, many of whom are seeking asylum. Mr. Lander, the comptroller, and advocates have said the city must shift its focus to getting all homeless residents into permanent housing more quickly: Even before migrants starting arriving en masse, the average stay in the troubled shelter system was over 500 days.
Earlier this month, City Hall announced that it would establish a new Office of Asylum Seeker Operations to coordinate all of the services it is providing to migrants, and Mr. Adams boasted about his administration's response at an event highlighting private donations for migrants.
"We go across the country, no one is doing it like New York, no one," he said, adding, "And we're around the clock."

Trend Pirouette: The Return of Ballet Flats: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Six ideal pairs of one of the season's trendiest (but hardest to get right) shoes.
While there's no doubt that ballet flats are everywhere right now, the definition of what constitutes a ballet flat is somewhat elastic. Here are some helpful parameters to keep in mind when looking for a pair of your own:
They are roughly the shape of ballet slippers with a round toe. (This seems obvious, but there's a lot of room for error.) They can have a little heel but nothing higher than a half an inch. An open toe is a no. Straps are sometimes allowed, but anything too hefty or with a buckle turns a shoe into a Mary Jane. An elastic strap works (as on the extremely popular varieties from Miu Miu or, even better, the ones from the Row). And that's it.
Maybe you're not sure how to feel about the return of this trend. Maybe, like me, you went through a ballet-flat phase a couple of decades ago and thought you were done with them. Did you love the aggressively rounded toes? Did you, like Amy Winehouse, wear them so often they were the color of hot dog water? Did you often return from a day walking around in them only to wonder why flat shoes that seemed so practical were in fact deeply uncomfortable?
Do you want to try them again, but are not sure how?
The best advice, which you must try to heed, is to resist the siren song of dressing like a ballerina. I love leotards and tiny wrap sweaters as much as the next Balanchine devotee, but don't wear ballet flats with them. Ballet flats that look too much like pointe shoes or have attached ribbons come across as costume-y.
Anyone who was obsessed with "The Twelve Dancing Princesses" knows that shoes like this wear out easily. So while you may find secondhand eggplant-colored Dior ballet flats with a braid or chocolate brown suede Lilly Pulitzer ones with a champagne metallic trim, you will have to sort through a lot of really worn-out pairs.
When you find the right ballet flats for you, get a cobbler to put a slip resistant tread on the soles, which will give the shoes a longer life. While you're there, get a padded insole to make them a little easier to wear.
Chanel
It turns out ballet dancers do wear ballet flats. Jenelle Manzi, who dances with the New York City Ballet, said on Instagram that she "can't even look at" one popular brand, "mostly because I think about the poor bones in my feet, but I got the perfect pair of ballet flats in Paris last summer at Chanel."
If a ballerina endorsement doesn't move you, know that Chanel ballet flats look good with everything. Also, they have a cap toe, and sometimes the toe contrasts with the rest of the flat, like a black toe with a pastel tweed, or a navy toe with a blue-green leather body. This being Chanel, notorious for its low levels of stock, you have to go in person and see what is available in your size. If you find any crayon-style colors in a size 39 -- taxi yellow, bright blue -- call me immediately. ( $ 875)
Maison Margiela
Maison Margiela is known for its many variations of the split-toe tabi shoe. Its fans are devoted to the tabi boots, but I think the tabi ballet flat is the friendliest entry point into that world. My friend Kat pointed me to the satin ones. "They're the softest tabis (spiritually)," she texted. The colors are really incredible -- deep violet, dark sage green, chestnut brown -- and would look good with any kind of jeans, but even better with oversize tailored trousers and a loose oxford shirt. ( $ 345, from $ 690)
Khaite
Khaite makes ballet flats with studded with Swarovski crystals. The best are black satin with the crystals in a kind of harlequin pattern. The more elaborate and luxe the ballet flat, the better it looks dressed down. So wear these with track shorts in the summer and a white ribbed tank top and you'll be the coolest person at the grocery store. ( $ 980)
The Row
Ballet flats can look a little too preppy when worn with skirts and dresses. They need the structure and square toe of these satin ones from the Row. How good would the cranberry red pair look peeking out from under a long black dress at some kind of spring gala? The bonus is that this is the next most comfortable thing with the exception of socks to wear to a long party. ( $ 790)
Reike Nen
It's easy to take for granted the delicate bows of many ballet flats. They're just kind of there, looking perfect. This pair has an elongated toe box and a bow that hits the middle of the foot, instead of at the toe. "The Reikes are more substantial as a styling element," said Anna Gray, who owns Club Vintage in Manhattan, a South Street Seaport shop that sells this style. So even though they are as versatile as a black shoe should be, they are subtly more elegant. And slightly less innocent. And so are you! ( $ 280, from $ 350)
Mansur Gavriel
Mansur Gavriel makes ballet flats with a high vamp, which some people prefer to showing a lot of toe cleavage. They do all the basic colors (Repetto and Margaux and French Sole also have a range of great shades), but the most exciting version is made of raffia. With white linen pants? Or what about Pleats Please pants for a contrast of soft and natural meets futuristic? ( $ 395)

Never Mind About DeSantis: [Op-Ed]

Author: Collins, Gail; Stephens, Bret

Publication info: Collins, Gail; Stephens, Bret.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Bret Stephens: Hi, Gail. I guess we have to talk about Donald Trump's potential indictment and arrest, right? But before we go there: You know how I told you that I'd vote for Ron DeSantis over Joe Biden?
Well, never mind.
Gail Collins: Bret! You're gonna vote for our big-spending president? Student-loan forgiver? Tax-the-richer?
Bret: I'm still holding out faint hope that Nikki Haley or Tim Scott or my friend Vivek Ramaswamy or some other sound and sane Republican long shot somehow gets the nomination.
Gail: Happy to gear up for that fight.
Bret: But for DeSantis to call Russia's invasion of Ukraine a "territorial dispute" in which the United States does not have a "vital interest" tells me that he's totally unfit to be president. He's pandering to the Tucker Carlson crowd.
Gail: The Terrible Tuckerites ...
Bret: He is parroting Kremlin propaganda. He's undermining NATO. He's endangering America by emboldening other dictators with "territorial disputes," starting with China's Xi Jinping. He's betraying the heroism and sacrifice of the Ukrainian people. He's turning himself into a kind of Diet Pepsi to Trump's Diet Coke. He's showing he's just another George Costanza Republican, whose idea of taking a foreign policy stand is to "do the opposite" of whatever the Democrats do.
Gail: Wow, can't believe I've found someone who thinks less of DeSantis than I do.
Bret: So, about Donald: to indict and arrest or not to indict and arrest? That's the question. Where do you come down?
Gail: No real doubts on the guilt front, and I'm pretty confident we'll eventually see an indictment. The question is -- what then? I'm hoping for a procedure in which he has to appear in public to answer the charges but doesn't get treated in any way that'll cause any not-totally-crazy supporters to gather for a riot.
Bret: True, though why do I get the sense that Trump is practically jumping for joy? I mean, the first indictment of a former American president is going to be over what is typically a misdemeanor? I yield to nobody in my disgust with the guy, but so far, this sounds like prosecutorial abuse and political malpractice. Democrats will live to regret it.
But to go from the horrifying to the truly horrifying: How goes your banking crisis?
Gail: Bret, would definitely appreciate this not being "my" banking crisis.
Bret: Give the crisis about six months. Or six weeks. Or maybe six days. It'll be all of ours. Suggest you buy inflation-proof assets, like a rare instrument or 50-year-old Scotch.
Gail: Or some great old wine! Although in my house it'd never outlast the bank bust.
As to a response, I'm in Bidenesque territory -- the government does what it has to do to stabilize the situation, including covering the deposits in delinquent institutions like Silicon Valley Bank. But the only people who get rescued are the depositors.
Bret: The big mistake of the administration was to bail out all the depositors, including a lot of very rich people who ought to have known better, instead of sticking to the F.D.I.C. limit of $ 250,000. Now the Feds have bailed out a bunch of rich, foolish and undeserving Silicon Valley dipsticks while creating an implicit, and systemically dangerous, guarantee for all depositors at all banks.
Gail: I don't love the idea of helping out $ 250,000-plus depositors, even over the short term, but this is not a good moment to destabilize the whole economy.
Over the long term, however, those banks, their managers and big stockholders are going to have to be held accountable. Also Congress, which watered down regulations on midsize banks a few years back.
Bret: Hard to tell whether the real issue was inadequate regulation, a badly run bank or -- my guess -- far deeper problems in the economy. Turns out Silicon Valley Bank didn't even have a full-time chief risk officer for much of last year.
Gail: You will notice I haven't mentioned the Federal Reserve. Saving that for you ...
Bret: The Fed now has two bad problems, both of them largely of its own making. The first is inflation, which remains stubbornly high and was brought on in part because interest rates were too low for way too long. The second is an economy, particularly the banking sector, that seems to be seriously ill prepared for an era of higher rates. A classic Scylla and Charybdis situation, through which Jay Powell is somehow supposed to steer us. My advice to Powell -- other than to tie himself to the mast -- is to continue to raise rates, even if it means recession, and call for fiscal relief in the form of tax breaks for businesses ....
Gail: Stopstopstop. Bret, Congress has to get a budget passed somehow, and the Republican plan is so nutty that even some Republicans don't buy it. You're suggesting that we cut taxes for businesses that are already making handsome profits.
Bret: Businesses may be looking forward to a steep recession and much steeper borrowing costs. It's a recipe for collapsing revenues and mass layoffs for businesses large and small. Better for the government to lighten the load for employers, even if it means piling on additional federal debt. In fact, it could be a good way to solve the debt-ceiling question.
Gail: The people who are demanding this kind of bonanza for the rich are the same ones who are violently opposed to giving the deeply underfunded I.R.S. any new money. What could be worse than efficiently monitoring tax compliance?
Bret: We're both in favor of giving the I.R.S. the funding it needs to answer taxpayer phone calls. But if the economy is about to fall off a cliff, I don't think the answer is to make sure the taxman is at the bottom of it, picking the pockets of the dead and wounded. Gail, this topic is ... getting me down. You wrote a column last week saying that Kamala Harris is definitely staying on Joe Biden's ticket. That gets me down, too, but please explain further.
Gail: Well, we both agreed for quite a while that if Biden ran again, he should pick a different veep.
Bret: Like Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, or Michelle Lujan Grisham, the governor of New Mexico, or Danielle Allen, the brilliant Harvard political philosopher who has the added virtue of not being a politician.
Gail: Yes, but then I gave it a long, hard thought -- trying to imagine how that would work out. Tossing Harris off the ticket would be hugely disrespectful. There's nothing she's done that deserves that kind of insult.
Bret: Did Nelson Rockefeller deserve it? Politics is politics.
Gail: There are lots of terrific women in high places -- governors and senators -- who'd be terrific as vice president. But we aren't starting from scratch. Harris has made some errors in her current job, but she's done some good things, too. Just don't think this rises to the occasion of Throw Her Out.
Bret: To me, she's Dan Quayle-level ridiculous -- and George H.W. Bush would have been wise to toss Quayle from the ticket in 1992. You can bet that whoever the Republican nominee is next year will hammer away at Biden's age and her shortcomings -- like saying we have a secure border with Mexico or confusing North and South Korea -- to very good political effect.
Gail: Let's go back to the president you ... may be willing to vote to re-elect. He's fighting hard to reduce federal student debt payments for low- and moderate-income people. I remember your not loving this idea in the past. Any change of heart?
Bret: Nope. The problem we have with the banks stems from what economists call moral hazard -- basically, encouraging risky behavior. Pardoning student debt is another form of moral hazard: It encourages people to take out loans unwisely in the expectation that they might one day be forgiven. If we are forgiving college loans now, why not forgive mortgages next? Also, it's an unconstitutional usurpation of Congress's legislative prerogatives. Democrats objected when Trump steered Defense Department money to building the border wall without congressional authorization; Democrats shouldn't further establish a bad precedent.
Assuming you see it otherwise.
Gail: Yeah. A lot of these people have been making loan payments for decades without making much progress in erasing the actual debt. None of them are rich, and a lot are struggling endlessly.
I can understand the resentment from folks who made a great effort and did pay off their loans. But we're talking, in general, about people who were given the impression that borrowing large amounts of money to get a no-frills degree was a great investment that always paid off.
Bret: If the government is expected to backstop everybody's bad or dumb decisions, the country would bankrupt itself in a week. Part of living in a free society is being responsible for your choices, including your mistakes.
Gail: I'm looking at this as a one-time shot that's worth taking. But I have to admit I don't love the idea of Biden acting without congressional authorization. Even though he wouldn't have gotten it.
Sigh.
Bret: Never mind Congress -- I can't see this getting past the Supreme Court, so what we're really talking about is another phony campaign promise.
Gail: Well, I guess it's a case of what ought to be versus what can be. But I still think there should be loan forgiveness for those who've spent half their lives trying to pay off a debt they were generally too young and uninformed to realize they should avoid.
Really, Bret, who wants to perpetually punish people who fell for the siren call of "borrow money for your education"?
Bret: In the meantime, Gail, we have Wyoming outlawing abortion pills. We'll need to devote more time to the subject soon, but all I'll say for now is: When the world goes to hell, it has a way of getting there fast.
Gail: I've been thinking about Wyoming so much, Bret. Let's go at it in depth next week. But if you hear that I was caught growling in public, you'll know why.

88-Year-Old Superfan At Every Indiana Game 'Couldn't Ask for More': [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Dick Moren, the father of Teri Moren, the Indiana women's basketball coach, is the team's No. 1 fan. He has a stringent game-day routine.
Dick Moren isn't in the Hoosiers' starting lineup, but he might as well be.
The 88-year-old father of Teri Moren, the coach of the Indiana University women's basketball team, he has two game-day outfits: one for home games, one for away games. He has routines before and after games that he follows religiously. His diet at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Ind., has been on lock for nine seasons.
Now, Pops, as many members of the Indiana staff and team call him, is preparing for his biggest role yet: the No. 1 fan of a No. 1-seeded team that is trying to make its way to the Final Four.
"I couldn't ask for more," Dick Moren said over the phone, proudly sharing the team's record entering the N.C.A.A. tournament: 27-3 overall and 16-2 in the Big Ten.
Since his daughter was hired at Indiana in 2014, Dick Moren has been a constant in the rotating cast of characters that make up college basketball. His relationship with his daughter and her team, his ever-present positivity and his dedication to all things Indiana basketball have made him a beloved face on the sideline.
On game days in Bloomington, he travels to campus from his home in Seymour, Ind., with Teri Moren and Leann Hutchinson, Teri's older sister. The three must exit the same door on their way to the car. Dick and Teri Moren sit up front talking shop -- "How are the kids looking?" he asks -- while Hutchinson sits in the back.
The sisters' brother, Scott Moren, is not allowed to commute to the game with them. Neither is Hutchinson's husband, Charles.
"They have to drive separately," Leann Hutchinson said. Only those who won't question the game-day superstitions are welcome in the car.
When the three commuters arrive at the arena, they go straight to the coach's office, where Dick Moren gets two or three pieces of candy -- "anything chocolate, but sometimes a Twizzler" -- before heading down to the court.
A new tradition was instituted this year: the pregame elevator selfie. "It just lightens the mood a bit because she has a game face on the minute we hit the door and say goodbye," Leann Hutchinson said of Teri Moren. They realized every time they took a selfie, Indiana won, and surely photos had something to do with it.
They may be on to something. This season, Indiana earned a No. 1 seed for the first time in program history. The Hoosiers won the Big Ten regular-season title for the first time since 1983. On Feb. 19, they sold out their home arena for the first time.
Teri Moren still seems in awe of the fact that she gets to share it all with her family by her side. "When you see our family, what really pops out is, 'Man, they're close. They really, really care about each other and love each other,"' she said. That love makes its way to the team.
"Over the years, I think the relationship with Coach Moren and her father has brought joy to the entire team," guard Chloe Moore-McNeil, a junior, said. "Seeing him always brightens our day."
Teri Moren's connection with her family shows "what kind of coach she is," said Sydney Parrish, another junior on the team.
On Saturday, Indiana took down a No. 16 seed, Tennessee Tech, 77-47, for its first win of the tournament. Dick Moren was there, in his usual spot at Assembly Hall. Of course he was.
He was there when Teri, at age 8, entered a punt, pass and kick contest. She beat all the boys, he said proudly. He was there for the A.A.U. games, there at Indiana University basketball camps, there for the high school games, the college games she played at Purdue and the games she coached at Indiana State.
But he wasn't in the loop when his daughter first applied for the Indiana coaching job. For the Moren family, Sundays were always for church, visiting Grandma and watching "The Bob Knight Show" and Indiana basketball. Teri Moren knew how excited her parents would get at the notion of her coming home to Indiana University. So she decided to wait until being offered the job before sharing that she was in the running.
But the news of her application made it into a newspaper.
"I'm sitting with my wife in the family room and looking at The Indianapolis Star and said, 'Do you know that Teri applied for the Indiana job?' And she said, 'No, did you?"' Dick Moren said, laughing at the memory. "She didn't want us to get our hopes up."
She received the offer in August 2014. "Get all the red and white you can because I'm coming home," she told her family.
At the time, her mother, Barbara, was dealing with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. She died that October, just after Teri Moren started her new job. The Indiana basketball team and Fred Glass, the athletic director at the time, went to the funeral.
Leann Hutchinson now likes to say that her mother has the best seat in the house.
When the coach goes to the court, her father goes to his reserved seat, one with empty seats to his left and right. Then he gets his game-day fuel: popcorn and a Diet Coke.
What if someone tries to sit on either side of him? "They can't," he said. "I've got reserved seats." Then Leann Hutchinson piped in. "There's a seat in between us," she said.
Dick Moren surely doesn't think he has much to do with the success of his daughter's team. But he doesn't necessarily think his routines hurt, either.
After the buzzer, win or lose, he and Leann will join Teri for media obligations and then follow the coach to her office.
"One of my most favorite things is my dad gets to listen to my staff decompress and talk about the game," Teri Moren said. "My staff is so great to him, as are our players. He feels like a part of the conversation. He always has his stat sheets with him, and he takes those home."
When everyone heads home, Dick Moren has more work to do. If the game is on the Big Ten Network, he'll rewatch it that evening. "Certainly the next day he will have watched that game once or twice," Teri Moren said. "He'll find something different once he watches it, but it's hard for him to watch the games that we lose."
If the Hoosiers keep this streak alive, they will head to Greenville, S.C., for the round of 16. Dick Moren is not planning on making that trip. He will wear his away-game outfit instead: khaki pants and an Indiana University sweatshirt. But if the team advances to the Final Four in Dallas, he will stop at nothing to get there.
There's only one thing he wouldn't do for the team, he said. When asked if he ever gave advice to the players, he stopped in his tracks.
"Goodness gracious, no," he said, almost aghast at the question. "Encouragement only. No X's or O's. Just do your best and that's all you can ask for."

For decades, institutions of higher education provided steady, well-paid jobs in small towns where the industrial base was waning. But the tide of young people finishing high school is now also starting to recede, creating a stark new reality for colleges and universities -- and the communities that grew up around them.
As Americans have fewer children and a diminishing share of young adults pursue a degree, the once-burgeoning market for college slots has kicked into reverse. Although undergraduate enrollment stabilized somewhat in 2022, it's still down about 7.6 percent since 2019.
"It looks like the future is declining numbers of young people likely to attend college, even in growing areas like the Mountain West," said Nathan Grawe, an economics professor at Carleton College in Minnesota who studies the demand for postsecondary education. "We'll start to have some tough stories."
Evidence of a shrinking student body is everywhere in the western Pennsylvania borough of Clarion, population 3,880, which has taken immense pride in the graceful campus of Clarion University since the institution was founded as a seminary 156 years ago.
Since 2009, when it had 7,346 students, the university has shrunk by nearly half. With the drop in enrollment has come the loss of nearly 200 staff members, mostly through attrition. Last year, the school even lost its name, as it was merged with two of the 13 other universities in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, creating a multicampus university called PennWest.
Tracy Becker, who looks out on Main Street from her broad desk at the city's chamber of commerce, says there aren't as many young volunteers for community events like the annual Autumn Leaf Festival, which has been held during homecoming weekend since 1953.
Kaitlyn Nevel's cafe used to be staffed mostly with university students; now she has one such employee. As foot traffic lightened, she branched into catering. "Ideally, I would love to see the university stay and thrive, but you just have to try and have however many backup plans," Ms. Nevel said.
As Ms. Nevel's resigned optimism suggests, declining enrollment doesn't necessarily spell doom for college towns. Despite the lower student head count, few empty storefronts mar Clarion's downtown. It has even attracted new businesses like Mechanistic Brewing, which Chelsea Alexander started with her husband in 2019 after moving back from Washington, D.C.
Ms. Alexander is one of 28 people in her family to attend the local university. Since 1905, her family has run a clothing shop in town, which sells a line of T-shirts that trade on alumni nostalgia for favorite eateries that have long since closed and for towering dorms that have been demolished. But as graduating classes shrink, even alumni visits will taper off.
Ms. Alexander's father, Jim Crooks, operates the store, and he has organized local merchants to spruce up the compact main street and market their businesses to potential visitors who may have no such connection to the town.
"For many years, the university was carrying a lot of the businesses," said Mr. Crooks, who has also converted four apartments above the shop from student housing into Airbnb lodgings. "Everybody's just saying, 'We can't depend on the university."'
Although Pennsylvania's university system had been shrinking for a decade, along with the rest of higher education, it experienced a sudden shock when students disappeared during the pandemic. Among those who noticed: the leaders at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, whose territory across Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware has a higher density of colleges and universities than most.
Along with large hospital systems, which are often affiliated with universities, educational institutions make up a substantial share of local economies that used to be dominated by manufacturing, logging and mining. Patrick T. Harker, the president of the Philadelphia Fed, wanted to find out how big that share was -- since the education and medical sectors were starting to show cracks as well.
"Traditionally, 'eds and meds' have been thought of as recession-proof," Dr. Harker said. "This pandemic showed that is not true."
Not all of those institutions are equally vulnerable, however. Rural hospitals have been drying up even as large health care chains build new facilities in fast-growing suburbs, while the dwindling pool of students flocks to state flagships. "They're stronger than ever, while the regional systems are really struggling," said Deborah Diamond, an economic development expert at the Philadelphia Fed.
Dr. Diamond put together a tool that showed how much different regions depended on health care and higher education. The places at the top of the dependence list were predictable, like the Durham-Chapel Hill area of North Carolina, with two powerhouse universities. But they also included smaller areas, like the one surrounding Bloomsburg, Pa., two and a half hours east of Clarion on Interstate 80. There, institutions including Geisinger Health and Bloomsburg University -- another state-owned school -- make up 21.9 percent of local employment and 18.3 percent of regional income.
"As we've seen some declines in manufacturing employment, their economic relevance is higher than it's ever been," said Fred Gaffney, the president of the area's chamber of commerce.
A similar set of factors is evident in Clarion County, where the university is still the largest employer, followed by Clarion Hospital. Walmart comes next, and then a few plants making building materials and prefabricated housing, several social service organizations and the county government. The county used to have more manufacturing, including a large glass plant that closed in 2010. As that receded, so did the county's population; its labor force dropped to 16,000 in 2022, from about 21,000 in 2008.
In the same period, Clarion University's enrollment began to fall, as did state funding, raising the price of attendance. In 2021, Daniel Greenstein, the chancellor of the State System of Higher Education, proposed forming two clusters of three schools each, to consolidate operations and offer more classes across campuses.
"We had to align our costs with our new enrollment numbers," Dr. Greenstein said in an interview. "We were built out as if we were still having 120,000 students when we had 85,000. You just can't do that. Like every American family, you have to live within your means."
At the same time, Mr. Greenstein requested more money from the State Legislature to enable the system to freeze tuition and offer more scholarships, which he said was critical to arresting the slide in enrollment. The state increased the system's base funding by 15 percent in 2022 and threw in $ 125 million from a federal stimulus measure. The freshman class grew slightly last fall, but not enough to offset another overall drop in enrollment.
For the merged schools, swooning enrollment underestimates the degree to which student presence has faded on campus. To bolster their course catalogs, the schools are offering more of their classes online. That allows some students to show up in person only a few days a week -- a trend that may accelerate as the system pursues more adult students, some of whom just need to finish degrees or complete shorter certificate programs.
Clarion's mayor, Jennifer Fulmer Vinson -- another Clarion graduate -- sees that as a loss for the borough. History classes come less often to her antiques shop, which sits in a century-old house reclaimed from a long-gone fraternity, stuffed with curios including an old Coke machine and a cabinet full of war medals.
"Why are students going to come pay to live on campus when they never leave their room?" Ms. Vinson said. "It's become more of a ghost town." (The university says that the first-year student experience is meant to be campus-centered and that most courses will remain in person.)
About an hour's drive west on Interstate 80 from Bloomsburg, the town of Lock Haven also has a university that last year merged with two others in the state-owned system. As the school has shrunk and well-paid staff members have moved away, the state's substantial tax-free land holdings have started to grate on local residents.
Gregory Wilson, the city manager, has created a handout showing what the median property owner pays in taxes to subsidize Lock Haven University: $ 186 annually.
"I think the hope has always been that the investment they're making to have the university here is somehow returned to them," Mr. Wilson said. "But that becomes a harder sell as the university becomes smaller."
The contraction has come alongside another recent and unwelcome development: The local hospital, which the sprawling University of Pittsburgh Medical Center bought in 2017, announced in January that it would shutter its inpatient operations, forcing residents to travel at least a half an hour for serious care.
All of it has been profoundly frustrating for Angela Harding, a Clinton County commissioner, who says that while she values the hospital and the university, drawing new residents to Lock Haven becomes harder as those economic anchors lose their grip.
"I'm sick and tired of having to fight for every single crumb that we get," Ms. Harding said.
Colleges and the towns they occupy can do little about demographic currents. But they should, experts say, reinforce each other -- the university can offer space for community functions and support for small businesses, for example, while the town can throw events for prospective students and their parents. Vacant student housing could be converted into homes for new residents who might be able to work remotely or want a quiet place to retire.
Matthew Wagner, the director of programs for Main Street America, a group dedicated to the development of small downtowns, says he sees less town-gown tension now that municipalities and schools understand their shared fates.
"Much like if you had a manufacturer that was facing headwinds, we need to think of the university as an economic development retention program, and direct our assets and resources that way," Dr. Wagner said.
Lock Haven has taken that idea to heart. Its main street is vibrant, with several new boutiques interspersed with longstanding local restaurants. Fabre Sanders, whose father runs a window-treatment store, moved back from Boston a few years ago to start a candy and gift shop. During the pandemic, she said, residents did everything they could to keep the shops alive.
"They looked around and said, 'If we don't support the local we have, we're going to have nothing,"' Ms. Sanders said.

The Innocent: [Review]

Full text: A light, enjoyable confection of a film that is built upon an amusingly absurd premise.
Louis Garrel's "The Innocent," which the French cinema star directed, wrote and stars in, is about as frothy and bite-size as heist movies get, one that has more in common with a rom-com than with "Dog Day Afternoon." That's not a knock. The film, which opens at IFC this Friday, is a humanistic story wrapped in a fun, punchy exterior, much like the French synth-pop music throughout its soundtrack.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Abel (Garrel), a young man who's grown apathetic since losing his wife in an accident, is close to his mother, Sylvie (Anouk Grinberg). But their relationship is tested when she marries a convict, Michel, (Roschdy Zem) shortly before his release. Abel's suspicions grow as Michel helps procure a flower shop for the family through mysterious means, leading Abel to spy on the former con with his close friend Clémence (a very charming Noémie Merlant). Predictably, Michel isn't as reformed as he claims to be, and Abel finds himself pulled into a criminal enterprise that he's in no way equipped for.
Garrel knows how to maintain tension throughout the film without giving the audience a panic attack, and he even manages to imbue it with stylistic flair here and there. (The fact that Abel and Clémence work at an aquarium certainly helps with unusual visuals.) But the entertainment value of "The Innocent" lies not in the actual heist -- which amounts to little more than a shipment of caviar at a truck stop -- but in its lighthearted comedy, its by-the-numbers romance plot and its relatable family drama grafted onto an absurd premise. It is, as one character orders at a diner, a "Coke Zero with sugar" of a film.
The Innocent

CLARION, Pa. — For decades, institutions of higher education provided steady, well-paid jobs in small towns where the industrial base was waning. But the tide of young people finishing high school is now also starting to recede, creating a stark new reality for colleges and universities — and the communities that grew up around them.
As Americans have fewer children and a diminishing share of young adults pursue a degree, the once-burgeoning market for college slots has kicked into reverse. Although undergraduate enrollment stabilized somewhat in 2022, it’s still down about 7.6% since 2019.
“It looks like the future is declining numbers of young people likely to attend college, even in growing areas like the Mountain West,” said Nathan Grawe, an economics professor at Carleton College in Minnesota who studies the demand for postsecondary education. “We’ll start to have some tough stories.”

You may still be wearing a coat, but spring is around the corner, and whether you’re dreaming of blossoms or baseball, it’s time to make reservations. With gardens, trails and enchanting views, these hotels make it a breeze to participate in beloved springtime traditions. From about $100 to more than $1,000 a night, they just might inspire you to celebrate cherry blossom season in Japan, feed chickens in the Hudson Valley or sip a cocktail in Paris on some of the city’s newest hotel rooftops.
WASHINGTON
Pendry Washington DC — the Wharf
What began in the early 1900s as a gift of thousands of Japanese cherry trees to the United States from Japan has become an annual tradition: Each spring, the U.S. capital is awash in pink and white blossoms — and people show up in droves to delight in them. The Tidal Basin has long been the go-to spot for viewing. If you want to be within walking distance of the basin as well as some of the city’s latest alfresco spots to eat, drink and enjoy live music, the Wharf — the nascent neighborhood with a promenade along the Washington Channel — is the place to be. It has views of the blossoming Kwanzan cherry trees in East Potomac Park and you can choose from hotel brands like Hyatt House, Canopy by Hilton and the InterContinental. In late October, Pendry Washington DC — the Wharf opened in a glass building with 131 rooms and suites, adding a bit of splash to the waterfront.
You can take in the view across the channel while sampling Japanese whiskey, sushi and treats like Tokyo fried chicken at the hotel’s rooftop bar and lounge, Moonraker. (For Latin American-inspired small plates, check out the Flora Flora restaurant.) Guests may also find themselves in the middle of the action for the Wharf’s annual Bloomaroo (April 1), a free spring festival with activities and events including koi kite decorating, face painting, music, beer gardens and pink fireworks. To get a closer look at the Kwanzan trees, hop on the free Wharf Jitney ferry to East Potomac Park. To see the trees around the Tidal Basin, simply go for a 20-minute stroll.
The citywide National Cherry Blossom Festival offers events and activities from March 18 through April 16, including the Sakura Matsuri — Japanese Street Festival, which describes itself as “the largest celebration of Japanese culture in the United States.” Back at the Pendry, you can stop at the Bar Pendry in the lobby for a cocktail, or head to Moonraker to watch night settle over the river in the distance. Rooms from $355 a night.
PARIS
Hôtel Madame Rêve
Few cities can rival the romance of Paris in springtime. And in the first arrondissement, amid tulips and sidewalk cafes, the Hôtel Madame Rêve is a buzzy perch from which to take it all in. Situated in the 19th-century Louvre post office building, the hotel, which has 82 rooms and suites, is a short walk from the Jardin des Tuileries. Madame Rêve, however, has plenty of its own greenery. At ROOF, its sprawling 1,000-square-meter (about 10,764 square feet) rooftop bar, there are plants, trees, cocktails, finger food and striking views of the city. For Japanese-influenced cuisine, there’s La Plume Rive Droite, which opens onto a patio with dozens of species of plants. There’s also the elegant Madame Rêve Café for Mediterranean-style food, which, on a sunny spring day, can be enjoyed on the terrace. Rooms from 500 euros, or about $532, a night.
TOO Hotel
Laurent Taïeb, the restaurateur and hotelier who founded Hôtel Madame Rêve, is also behind TOO Hotel, which opened in October atop one of the Tours Duo skyscrapers designed by Jean Nouvel. At the edge of Paris in the 13th arrondissement, it’s near the Seine, within walking distance of the Jardin des Plantes, and about a 15- to 20-minute drive from the Paris-Orly Airport. That location enables the hotel to provide the sorts of panoramic views more often associated with properties in cities like New York and Shanghai. Its 139 rooms and suites, designed by Philippe Starck, all have city vistas. And like Madame Rêve, it has an intriguing new rooftop destination: TOO TacTac Skybar. There are also postcard views from TOO Restaurant, where you can try dishes from around the world, be it shakshuka or lobster tempura. And the spa has an outdoor hot tub on a terrace with plants, trees and views over the Seine. Happily, the only thing that’s not sky-high is the starting room rate. Rooms from 220 euros a night.
HUDSON VALLEY, NEW YORK
Wildflower Farms
For those who want to experience spring unfolding on a farm but also want a spa, a sommelier and perhaps some custom cedar-scented soaps, there’s Wildflower Farms, Auberge Resorts Collection, a new 140-acre luxury retreat with 65 cabins, cottages and suites in Gardiner, New York. The resort, about an hour and a half from New York City, allows guests to embrace spring amid grasses and wildflowers, and on its three miles of trails. (The nearby Mohonk Preserve provides additional opportunities for hiking and rock climbing.) Wildflower Farms also offers activities and classes inspired by nature, such as pressed-flower pottery, flower arranging, foraging and botanical baking. You can feed the chickens and, if you like, collect the day’s eggs. Go for a dip in the outdoor pool (or simply visit the bar alongside it), try the spa (there are outdoor hot tubs and an indoor saltwater pool) and work out at the open-air fitness center.
When you retire to your room, you won’t lose sight of the area’s beauty. The cabins and cottages have wall-to-wall glass sliding doors, providing guests with “in-bed vistas,” as well as large private terraces with daybeds. Ridge suites have two fireplaces, a terrace with a cedar hot tub, indoor and outdoor showers, and of course, views of the Shawangunk Ridge, better known as the Gunks. When you get hungry, there’s New American fare at the restaurant, Clay. Morning coffee, pastries, snacks and cocktails can be had at the main building on the open-air Great Porch, where you can sink into a velvet couch beside a fire and gaze at the mountains. Rooms from $1,000 a night.
ATLANTA
Omni Hotel at the Battery Atlanta
Yet another rite of spring, Major League Baseball season, is almost here. And for those who wish to turn a game into a weekend getaway, there are hotels such as the 264-room-and-suite Omni Hotel at the Battery Atlanta, just a few hundred feet from Truist Park, the home of the Atlanta Braves. The Premier, Executive and Luxury rooms (the latter have private terraces with fire pits, sofas and tables) feature various views of the stadium or field, and their red and white touches are a nod to baseball.
Traveling with someone who’s not a fan? Your companion can stroll the surrounding area, known as the Battery Atlanta, where there are places to grab a bite, like Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams and Antico Pizza Napoletana, as well as live music at Coca-Cola Roxy and movies at Silverspot Cinema.
Rooms at the Omni Hotel start at $274 a night. You can also add a baseball package that includes valet parking, breakfast, nightly children’s turndown service with milk and cookies, and tickets for a tour of Truist Park.
TOKYO AND SOUTHERN JAPAN
Fairfield by Marriott’s Michi-no-Eki hotels
What better way to celebrate Japan’s reopening after being closed to much of the world at the height of the pandemic than with a cherry blossom road trip — and new hotels to check into along the way?
Seven Fairfield by Marriott hotels are opening this year in the prefectures of Hyogo, Kagoshima, Okayama, Saga, Kumamoto and Fukuoka as part of Marriott’s ongoing Michi-no-Eki project. Located in rural places near roadside rest areas (known in Japan as Michi-no-Eki), the hotels are often close to national parks and cultural sites. They offer affordable rooms, from about 225 to 270 square feet, with free Wi-Fi. Several opened in places such as Hokkaido and Nara, and in January, the 88-room Fairfield by Marriott Hyogo Tajima Yabu opened in Yabu, a city in Hyogo prefecture, which is home to Mount Hyonosen, Tendaki Falls and Tarumi-no-Ozakura, a cherry tree said to be more than 1,000 years old.
This spring, more Michi-no-Eki hotels are on the way. The 78-room Fairfield by Marriott Okayama Tsuyama is scheduled to open on April 11 in Okayama, an easy drive to the ruins of Tsuyama Castle in Kakuzan Park, a prime cherry blossom viewing spot. And the 95-room Fairfield by Marriott Kagoshima Tarumizu is set to open on April 12 in Kagoshima, where you can visit the (recently active) Sakurajima volcano; check out sites from Japan’s Meiji Industrial Revolution, which are on UNESCO’s World Heritage List; and if you have time, make the ferry trip to Yakushima Island to visit the cedar forests, thought to have inspired the Studio Ghibli film “Princess Mononoke.” All three properties have rooms from 13,000 yen, or about $96, a night.
Bulgari Hotel Tokyo
On April 4, the 98-room-and-suite Bulgari Hotel Tokyo is scheduled to open in the capital, bringing Italian design to the top of the Tokyo Midtown Yaesu skyscraper. Guests will be within walking distance of the Imperial Palace, one of the most popular spots in Tokyo for enjoying cherry blossoms. A longer walk will bring you to yet another beloved blossom destination, the Chidori-ga-fuchi Moat. For sweeping views of the city and, on a clear day, Mount Fuji, head to the Bulgari Bar, which will have terraces on the 45th floor. The hotel will also have a spa (with an indoor pool), a fitness center and restaurants featuring Japanese and Italian culinary traditions: Sushi Hoseki by Kenji Gyoten and Il Ristorante by Niko Romito. Should you wish to go farther afield, you’re a two-minute walk from Tokyo Station, making it easy to board a train and explore other parts of Japan. Prices from 250,000 yen, or about $1,850.

Full text: The biggest presence on the runways of Paris Fashion Week (other than a big black overcoat) was feathers. Why?
The runways of Paris have felt heavy this season. But among the inky overcoats with bold shoulders, the long black leather jackets and solemn silhouettes that encase the body like armor, a lighter trend was taking flight: feathers.
At Loewe, goose plumes were densely layered to create long-sleeved tops, shorts and pants; at Victoria Beckham, a large ostrich feather rippled out from under trench coats and pantsuits or was tucked into the plunging neckline of a floor-skimming evening dress.
In his debut collection for Ann Demeulemeester, Ludovic de Saint Sernin presented identical looks at the start and finish -- a fluid silk maxi-skirt and feather bandeau in leather resting across the model's breasts (intended, he said, to look like a writing quill). At Chanel, large marabou clusters fluttered from a simple black knitted shift; and at Valentino, feathery crests stood at attention to accent crisp poplin shirts, thigh-skimming miniskirts and a showstopping black and white diagonally striped coat.
Feathers have long been fashion week favorite for designers. But at a time when the world feels increasingly somber and austere, their presence offered a soft and airy contrast to much of the grounded and wearable clothing on display -- and a particularly poignant nod to those dreaming of escape.
This was on display in the ostrich feathers that trimmed sharp suiting and fluted sleeves on cocktail gowns at the Turkish label Dice Kayek, whose creative director, Ece Ege, said she had been absorbed by the devastation caused by the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria last month. A similar notion was at the heart of the latest collection from Bevza, a Ukrainian label that has shown at New York Fashion Week in recent years.
"In our world of oppression, pressure and anxiety, we need freedom, lightness and the ability to fly," said its founder, Svitlana Bevza, who was showing in Paris for the first time. "We need wings, to soar above the chaos and glide to freedom."
Minimalist white minidresses came with detachable winglike sleeves. A black sheath had capped shoulders that were finished with ruffling silk "feathers," hand-cut in Ms. Bevza's Kyiv atelier, amid air raid sirens and blackouts.
For centuries, feathers have offered the promise of transformation. But there is a price to pay, especially when there is still widespread evidence of cruelty in the global down and feather industries. Stella McCartney tried to point this out at her show, which took place against a backdrop of galloping horses at the École Militaire, France's oldest riding school.
"There's so much leather and feathers on the runway, especially in winter, and I just wanted to show that you can do it in a different way," Ms. McCartney said after her show, which included crocodile-effect AppleSkin from apple waste and a white handbag made from Mylo (a material made from the fungus mycelium).
In time, they too may take off.

No city manages to function as both a mirror and crystal ball during fashion week quite like Paris, where the scenes outside and inside the shows often contain the truest glimpses of what is trendy now and what will be hot next.
What’s relevant now can be discerned on the street, where a sea of skirts suggested the garment has become a wardrobe staple regardless of gender. Most styles were long, and many were patterned. On colder days, some of the skirts were layered over trousers, a combination that stood out more when the pants were baggier.
As for where fits — the sizes and shapes of clothes, that is — may be headed, brands offered clues on their runways. Balenciaga showed tops with contorted proportions that made models look kind of like turtles. Valentino presented boxy jackets with super short shorts. And a few designers, Loewe among them, experimented with straps, embellishing garments with long chains or strips of material meant to be worn over a shoulder like the handle of a bag.

Drug-Fueled Bear Steals the Movie: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: The horror-comedy is based on a real story from 1985, but the director Elizabeth Banks and writer Jimmy Warden gave their furry lead a different ending.
Jimmy Warden wanted his bear to have its full 15 minutes of fame -- while it was still alive.
A few years back, Warden, a screenwriter, stumbled upon the tale of a 175-pound black bear that had dropped dead in a Georgia forest after ingesting cocaine that the drug smuggler Andrew Thornton had thrown from a plane. Thornton had parachuted out, weighed down with $ 14 million worth of the drug along with firearms and survivalist equipment. He was found dead on Sept. 11, 1985, wearing a bulletproof vest and Gucci loafers, on a driveway in Knoxville, Tenn.
The bear's corpse, stuffed and christened Pablo Escobear, supposedly ended up at the Kentucky for Kentucky Fun Mall in Lexington, Ky.
Some believe that's how it happened; others think it's an urban legend.
But Warden was more intrigued by the bear than the smuggling, and he let his imagination run wild. The result is the new comedy "Cocaine Bear."
"I took the story and was like, 'What if it didn't die?"' he said in a video call from his home in Los Angeles.
Besides, he felt bad for the bear and thought, "Let's give this bear a win by way of mauling a couple of people in the woods."
The way Warden saw things, the bear wasn't the villain -- it was the victim.
Warden invented a 500-pound version of the black bear that, high on cocaine, goes on a blood-and-guts rampage terrorizing campers, a ranger, children and other sundry visitors to the woods.
He sent the script to a friend, who gave it to a producer at the production company Lord Miller, who handed it off to Universal executives, who bought it. And in about a week, Warden's professional life became a very different creature.
The script landed with Elizabeth Banks, and she immediately recognized an antidote to the world's pandemic and climate-change woes: a funny, crazy tale that reminded her of "Pulp Fiction," with its edgy blend of intricately woven story lines, drug dealers and gore, sprinkled with some "Stand by Me" moments.
"I just thought, 'Wow, there is no greater metaphor for the chaos going on in nature,"' she said on a video call. "And not only that, it was the humans that did it. They're the real bad guys."
Banks started contacting friends and acquaintances, while others made their way to her.
She asked Keri Russell to read the script. "It just felt like a complete, ridiculous, stupid, amazingly funny departure and relief from life," said Russell, who plays Sari, the divorced mother of a 12-year-old girl missing in the woods with a friend.
And when Russell learned that Banks wanted to cast Margo Martindale, her former co-star on "The Americans," as the ranger, she said, "Oh, I'm in," because she could see Banks's desire to keep the story real.
"You don't cast Margo Martindale if it's going to be a flat-out silly comedy the whole way," Russell said.
Just silly enough.
"It would be a severe close-up on me screaming about the bear attack," Russell recalled, "with Banks screaming in the background, 'OK, now the bear is ripping his leg off and blood is squirting everywhere and he's screaming and now his torso falls out of the tree!"'
"That's the thing with these movies -- you can't just half-ass it," she added. "You've got to go for it, and the bigger you go, the better it is."
Russell was packing for Ireland, where the film was shot in 2021, when her husband, Matthew Rhys, decided he wanted in on the action too -- specifically the role of the smuggler.
"Text her right now, tell her I want to do that part," Rhys urged Russell. She did, and he was hired (making for a mini-reunion of stars of "The Americans.")
When O'Shea Jackson Jr. read on Twitter that Banks had secured the rights to "Cocaine Bear," his first thought was, "There's no way they're going to get a movie like this made."
But he retweeted the announcement, his excitement obvious. Banks got wind and signed him up as Daveed, the trusted fixer for the drug kingpin Syd (Ray Liotta) and former best friend of Syd's son, Eddie (Alden Ehrenreich). Jackson and Ehrenreich developed such camaraderie off the set that their story was rewritten to give it a more heartwarming arc.
And working with Liotta, in one of that actor's last roles before his death in May, "was an unexpected blessing in my career," Jackson said.
The shoot was not without its drawbacks: bees and mosquitoes attracted to fake blood; remembering lines in an ice-cold river.
But it was also the first movie in which Jackson's character underwent a mutilation that required prosthetics. "I really dug that part of it," he said.
Warden was pretty much in heaven with Banks's approach.
"It was just like, 'Hell yeah, we're going to rip off this guy's hand now and then we're going to have this severed leg fall to the ground and the bear is going to do a line of coke off of it!"' he said. "To collaborate with somebody who was down to do all that stuff was a dream come true."
Even Liotta, Banks recalled, was game. "This movie is crazy, so the idea that I was like, 'Can you get on these wires and fight a bear performer?' -- I don't think Martin Scorsese ever said that to him. But I got to, and he delightedly did it."
Which brings us to the beast that Banks and her crew lovingly called Cokey.
"Cocaine Bear" was going to require a computer-generated apex predator as formidable as its name. And Weta FX, the New Zealand special effects company that had worked on "The Lord of the Rings" and the "Planet of the Apes" films, understood the need for a photorealistic, documentary-credible bear. But because it was high on cocaine, there were opportunities to stretch in little ways to create a superpowered character.
That's when Allan Henry, a motion-capture and stunt performer, arrived on set to help bring Cokey to life.
Suited up in black spandex and gloves with bits of fur, Henry wore arm extenders and stilts, depending on whether Cokey was on four legs or two, that enabled him to move like a quadruped. He also wore a helmet with a silicone bear snout attached to two telescoping rods and Ping-Pong balls for the eyeline.
That soft snout allowed him to nuzzle or sniff actors without injuring them, and gave them a sense of weight and scale to play opposite, whether he was crashing into an ambulance or dancing.
But what is a bear without its voice?
"Oh, I made so many noises," Henry said. "I tend to vocalize anyway, no matter what performance I'm doing, because the breath and the vocalization energizes your body. I can't roar like a bear, but I can definitely be loud and I can kind of snuffle and grunt and sneeze and make weird noises in the bush."
He could even play a coked-up Cokey.
"E.B. has great ideas," Henry said of Banks. "She was like, 'Maybe you jump a little bit higher, or maybe you crash this way, or maybe you don't notice this thing because you're so focused on the bag."'
"The idea was to have a heightened performance that didn't go over the line," he said.
About two months before she learned of "Cocaine Bear," Natalia Martinez, an investigative reporter for WAVE News, the NBC affiliate in Louisville, had begun working on a documentary about Andrew Thornton and the cultlike following of Pablo Escobear.
Martinez drove to the store that claimed to have the real bear. Then she spoke with the medical examiner who had performed the necropsy in 1985 and learned two things: The bear had consumed about six grams of coke, according to tests. And its carcass was a heap of bones, hide and fur. No stomach left to back up claims that it had eaten millions of dollars' worth of cocaine. No head to attach to another bear's body.
"There's no absolute way that this bear could have been taxidermied," the medical examiner told her. Agents with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Natural Resources agreed.
"Blow: The True Story of Cocaine, a Bear and a Crooked Kentucky Cop," which begins streaming March 10 on YouTube and other platforms, also delves into the missing 200 kilos of cocaine and a plane that the F.B.I. thought had been sabotaged by Colombian smugglers.
Whatever the true story, Martinez, the executive producer of the documentary, sees only good in the two films' serendipity.
"I think I owe them a kidney," she said, laughing.
"Cocaine Bear" had its Kentucky premiere in Lexington on Thursday. Pablo Escobear was in attendance.

The Truth About the 'Censorship' of Roald Dahl: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When it was reported last month that hundreds of words had been changed or removed in the most recent British editions of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," "Matilda" and other books by Roald Dahl in an effort to make them less offensive, everyone from the queen consort and the British prime minister to the head of PEN America expressed outrage. Salman Rushdie referred to the edits as "censorship."
This is not the first time we have had one of these extended struggle sessions about ethics in children's literature. The decision, for instance, by the Dr. Seuss estate in 2021 to end the sale of six books because of imagery deemed offensive also led to competing cries of "racism" and "cancel culture."
There is something absurd, however, about the amount of preening occasioned by a handful of alterations to books about Brobdingnagian fruit and talking insects. Whatever Dahl's place in the annals of 20th-century children's fiction, it is striking that these culture war arguments somehow always revolve around authors like him and Dr. Seuss; one is forced to confront the distinctly horrifying possibility that "If I Ran the Zoo" and "James and the Giant Peach" are the only books that millions of Anglophone readers have ever actually finished. (That the changes to Dahl's texts first began to appear more than a year ago without attracting any significant attention until now should tell us something about the level of readerly attention brought to bear on books that sell tens of thousands of copies each year.)
Despite the indignation of the critics and the high-mindedness of the revisers, the truth is that most of the edits to the Dahl books are of very little importance. Many are slight (replacing "old hag" with "old crow") or inscrutable ("taught him how to spell and write sentences" for "volunteered to give him lessons"). Others are needlessly "sensitive" (changing "black" to "dark," even when the connotations are not racial, or "attractive" to "kind") but do not seriously affect the author's meaning. A handful of the edits are unintentionally hilarious: Insisting that "man-eating giant" be replaced with "human-eating giant," as in the new edition of "The BFG," sounds like an unclever right-wing parody of wokeness. But the most worrisome thing about this is the stylistic ineptitude.
The assumption that there is an urgent debate here, one of the utmost importance to the future of culture, society and so on, is politically useful to both sides. But what both sides are really arguing about is not whether it's ever OK to make posthumous edits, but who gets to make them and why.
In the Dahl case, the changes were proposed by consultants at an organization called Inclusive Minds, which is purported to foster "inclusion, diversity, equality and accessibility in children's literature." The edits were permitted by the Roald Dahl Story Company, which manages the author's copyrights and trademarks, and which was later purchased by Netflix. The profit-seeking corporate context in which the changes were made should raise eyebrows more than the mere fact that people have been mucking around with the texts.
After all, not even the most strident critics of Dahl's editors can really believe that it is always unacceptable to alter the texts of famous works of literature. I have never heard anyone object to the fact that in editions of "The Great Gatsby" published since 1992, numerous perceived errors of both fact and internal chronology have been corrected, such as the age of Tom and Daisy Buchanan's daughter and the name of the real hotel where the couple are married. (Though perhaps we should object, given that we might reasonably expect errors in a first-person narrative about Jazz Age boozers.)
Altering literary texts to suit various needs, including the perceived tastes and sensibilities of readers, has long been the norm rather than the exception. In his edition of Shakespeare published in 1725, Alexander Pope regularized the meter and cleaned up the grammar ("more headier" became "more heady") in an attempt to bring it in line with the decorous norms of 18th-century prosody; countless lines that Pope considered unworthy of the author were relegated to a footer at the bottom of the page. A few decades later, when David Garrick's performances of the plays were helping to elevate Shakespeare to his present position in the canon of English drama, the most commonly staged version of "King Lear" featured a happy ending originally written in 1681, which even Samuel Johnson preferred.
In 1818, Dr. Thomas Bowdler (the inspiration for "bowdlerize") and his sister Harriet published their second edition of "The Family Shakespeare," in which they removed sexual and ostensibly blasphemous material from the plays, including Iago's immortal description of the marital act. ("Your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs" was reduced to "Your daughter and the Moor are now together.")
It was only later in the 19th century, with the Romantic cult of the author and the rise of academic textual scholarship, that the notion of a sacrosanct authorial vision began to take hold. But even then, such standards tended to apply only to established authors. The most common English editions of many 19th-century French novels were still heavily bowdlerized; an English translation of "The Three Musketeers" that achieved a suitably high level of fidelity to Dumas was not available until 2006.
But those versions of Dumas, including the Tor Classics paperback that I still cherish, delighted millions of children, inspired countless films and gave rise to one famous candy bar. One might even go so far as to say that they have achieved classic status in their own right, in the same way that C.K. Scott Moncrieff's English translation of Proust is (for some of us) an achievement arguably superior to the French original. In comparison with the familiar sanitized versions, Dumas's original is an obscure, slightly seedy French romance.
All of which is to say that making changes, even rather sweeping ones, to classic works of literature is not as controversial as some would like to imagine. The question we should be asking ourselves is not whether it is ever reasonable but who should be able to do so -- and in what spirit and with what purpose. (If a publisher issued, say, an edition of "The Picture of Dorian Gray" for evangelical Christian home-schoolers that excised references to homosexuality, I suspect many of the people who freely edited Dahl's books would suddenly be extolling the sanctity of authorial intent.)
In the Dahl case, the edits were not the result of academic deliberation, like the "corrected texts" incorporated into paperback versions of Faulkner novels. Nor were they an admixture of scholarship and financial incentives, like the Hans Walter Gabler edition of Joyce's "Ulysses" that reset the novel's copyright status in the 1980s. Here, it was a company treating Dahl's beloved creations as if they were merely its assets, which they in fact were.
I, for one, do not believe that philistines should be allowed to buy up authors' estates and convert their works into "Star Wars"-style franchises, as Netflix now seems to be doing, having purchased the Roald Dahl Story Company. In a saner world there would be a sense of curatorial responsibility for these things. "Owning" works of literature, insofar as it should be possible at all, should be comparable to a museum's ownership of a Caravaggio. Clarify and contextualize, promote and even profit -- but do not treat art like you would your controlling interest in a snack foods consortium.
Which is exactly how Dahl's new owners are behaving. As some constitutionally cynical observers expected, l'affaire Dahl has turned out to be one of those New Coke/Coca-Cola Classic gambits. After a few days of free marketing from the perpetually outraged, it was announced that a 17-volume set of the "classic" versions of Dahl's books would soon be published. While many culture warriors will be happy to claim this news as a victory, they should ask themselves for whom.

Proust's McNugget: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Have you experienced the magic of McDonald's Sprite? With its electric spice, its zhush, its je ne sais quoi, it is, of course, supreme among all sugary drinks, a star in the great firmament of processed foods.
I grew up loving processed foods: There's the kind in a can (SpaghettiOs, Chef Boyardee, Vienna Sausage) and the kind in a cardboard box or plastic container (the many varieties of Hamburger Helper or instant ramen). There's the fresh kind (McDonald's and KFC, Popeyes and Burger King, Domino's, Pizza Hut and Little Caesars) and there's the frozen kind (Tyson and Totino's, Gorton's, Swanson and Ore-Ida, frozen finger foods and full-on meals). And there's fancy-ish processed food of the Red Lobster or Olive Garden or LongHorn Steakhouse variety, and there's less fancy processed food, like chicken wings from 7-Eleven or hot dogs or burritos or insert-your-regional-specialty-here from the convenience store down the street.
For much of my 24 years, I was a processed-food connoisseur. The Tex-Mex dishes characteristic of the Rio Grande Valley, where I grew up, and these processed foods, distinctly American, constituted my diet through the end of high school. About half of the Rio Grande Valley is a food desert, a phrase that describes a place where it's hard to obtain healthy, nutritious foods because of factors like cost, distance and time. But even those who can get something other than processed and fast food often still eat it. Almost all the people I knew ate this way, didn't mind eating this way, enjoyed eating this way, even though they knew it was unhealthy.
Today, I'm embarrassed to admit that I loved these foods, that I ate them without much of a second thought for most of my life. I'm embarrassed because I "know better" now.
I use that phrase only because I have received a social education that has taught me that some foods are "good" and others are "bad," that what I eat says something meaningful about who I am.
This social education began when I went to Yale, where, as The Times has reported, at one point "more students came from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the entire bottom 60 percent." Many people I met there couldn't distinguish among chicken nuggets from McDonald's, Burger King and Chick-fil-A.
My freshman year, I found myself listening to some classmates chatting about ice cream, homemade with fresh strawberries. They went on about how singular and spectacular it was, about how much they loved it. I'd never eaten ice cream made with fresh strawberries, had never eaten homemade ice cream. My naïveté led me to believe that this shouldn't stop me from participating in the conversation, so I said that I liked the flavor of artificial strawberry ice cream. There's just something about that fake flavor, I said, something special about strawberry syrup.
The people around me looked at me as if I were an alien. I understood then that I was an alien, that processed food was the food of the Other America -- or what most Americans just call America. I already knew that I wasn't part of the 1 percent, but this moment underscored that where I came from and what I liked were more foreign than I could have imagined.
For a while, I continued to defend this way of eating to other people and to myself. Whereas critics and skeptics balked at the ease with which processed food could be acquired and produced, I lauded the efficiency of the industrialized food system. Whereas the foodies squinted at the amalgamating of animal products and preservatives into something palatable, I sang the praises of foods that were, in their mediocrity, paradoxically pretty good. Whereas the closet processed-food enjoyers (I know you're out there!) fretted about processed food being unnatural, I wondered who needed nature anyway, that source of decay and death.
I was embarrassed to find an ally in Donald Trump. His love of Big Macs, Filet-O-Fishes and Diet Coke made people's heads explode. When he served a feast of fast food at the White House? The scandal!
Still, for me, McDonald's in the White House sounded like a dream. It was easy to laugh at the contradictions between Mr. Trump's cultural tastes and his class status, but I understood that those very contradictions are what made him a democrat with a lowercase d, just another American who ate processed food, what he calls "Great American food."
But the more time I spent in this world of homemade ice cream and duck and kale, the more familiar it became to me. Further moments of alienation helped accelerate my assimilation: "Oh, you're from the Rio Grande Valley?" a professor with limited experience of the area once asked me. "That's where they think Olive Garden is a fancy restaurant, right?" My new peers might have been ignorant of the foods that raised me, but I wasn't going to return the favor.
I have expanded my culinary horizons. When I moved to New York in 2021, I decided to stock my kitchen with many of the pots, pans and gadgets recommended by the website Serious Eats. I bought and skimmed the cookbook "Salt Fat Acid Heat." I learned how to brine and roast a chicken. I started buying salads from Trader Joe's.
I didn't stop eating processed foods. In fact, I probably ate more of them. In the maelstrom of the past three years, a time filled with loss, uncertainty and change, in which I graduated from college during a pandemic and moved to New York to start a job that was supposed to last only a year, I sought an anchor in the foods of my youth. I wanted to recapture that magic, the excitement at the prospect of satisfaction and pleasure. So I ate McDonald's and Little Caesars and Hamburger Helper, trying to achieve what the food writer M.F.K. Fisher describes as that "warmth and richness and fine reality of hunger satisfied."
The old comfort, however, was nowhere to be found. It felt as if I were sitting at a slot machine, pulling the lever over and over, waiting for this order, this pizza, this French fry to make me feel I'd hit the jackpot. But the food just made me feel sick. My skin would itch, my stomach would turn. I'd get a headache.
By the latter half of 2022, I'd turned my temporary job into a permanent one, renewed my lease and had begun to ease further into the life of a member of the professional-managerial class. The maelstrom, if not completely calmed, was abating. Around that time, I began to experience odd cravings. One evening, I wanted lettuce. With apples and walnuts. And chicken -- cold. I had to Google it to be sure, but I realized I wanted a Waldorf salad.
My culinary tastes have changed along with my socioeconomic position. I have come to accept that the kinds of food we eat and appreciate signal to the world and to ourselves something about who we are, about who we were, about who we have become. I'm fundamentally happy to now live a life where I not only understand references to the madeleine in Proust but have actually eaten one (and at a writing class in the South of France, no less).
But I am mourning the loss of something I loved -- I wish eating a McNugget could still transport me to a time of warmth and love and safety, a time when I didn't know what a madeleine was, when I didn't know any better.

Black Equestrians Plead for Helmets That'll Fit: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Chanel Robbins has been riding horses most of her life, ever since her grandmother traded a cow from their family's farm in Ontario for a pony when she was 7.
Galloping through the fields on her pony, Star, offered an escape from thoughts that weighed on her -- that she didn't have a relationship with her biological parents, for instance, or that she was the only Black girl in the neighborhood, aside from her sister.
About eight years ago, she reconnected with her father, a native of Jamaica. As the two grew closer, Ms. Robbins decided to style her hair in locs, like her dad. But there was a problem: Her riding helmet no longer fit, and she couldn't find one that did.
"I finally freaking feel like myself, and now society is asking me to change," Ms. Robbins, 27, of Alliston, Ontario, said as she choked back tears. "I just want to be able to ride."
Black equestrians have long felt virtually invisible in a sport that remains overwhelmingly white. For those with natural hair, which for many is a declaration of pride and Black identity, finding a helmet that fits properly can be nearly impossible, creating yet another barrier to full inclusion. Some are now lobbying for change, mindful that horseback riding is among the leading causes of sports-related traumatic brain injury. The helmet companies say there isn't a simple fix.
Among those raising awareness on social media is Caitlin Gooch, who grew up riding horses on her family's farm in Wendell, N.C. For Ms. Gooch, 30, who wears her hair in locs that fall to her mid-back, safety has been of paramount concern because her father injured his neck in a fall from a horse when he was not wearing a helmet. When she has her hair redone, about once every two months, she brings her riding helmet with her to ensure it will still fit.
Around 2015, when she started teaching riding lessons, she found herself having to tell children they couldn't ride if there was no helmet that properly fit them. In 2021, she started a hashtag, #saddleuphelmeton, to call attention to the problem.
Trying to stuff a head into a helmet that doesn't fit presents a safety risk, not unlike "trying to fit a baby into a car seat that doesn't fit them," Ms. Gooch said. "The helmet just would not do what it was supposed to do."
'People Are Different, Hair Is Different'
Several prominent equestrian helmet manufacturers contacted by The New York Times said they were not aware that many Black riders struggled with helmet fit. Others said they recognized that it was an issue and were working to address it, while cautioning that bringing a new helmet to market is a costly undertaking that can take years.
The Times spoke with nearly a dozen Black riders, several of whom described searches for properly fitting helmets that dragged on for months or even years. Some said they had been turned away from equestrian stores by employees who said they couldn't help them. A few said they had manipulated helmets by stuffing them or cutting the lining.
Isabella Tillman, who wears her hair in natural, buoyant curls in the summer and straightens it in the winter, is horrified when she thinks about the helmets she has used in 20 years of riding.
One sat atop her head like a traffic cone, she said. Another was so small it gave her headaches. And one was so big, she had to stuff it with maxi pads.
"There is nothing out there in the industry that is addressing these needs," said Ms. Tillman, 29, of Detroit, who is working toward becoming an equine veterinarian. "People are different, hair is different and heads are different."
'A Big Issue for a Small Amount of People'
It is not clear exactly how many riders are affected. The United States Equestrian Federation, one of the major governing bodies overseeing competitive horse sports, does not require its 447,000 members to disclose their race, and only about half do so. Of those, nearly 92 percent are white, with Black riders making up only 0.5 percent.
Helmet inclusivity is important, Black equestrians said, because it could mean the difference between life and death. A 2019 study published in the journal Sports Medicine found that 70 percent of reported equestrian falls caused a head injury. Wearing a properly fitting helmet helped prevent more serious injuries, such as skull fractures, the study found.
Dr. Thomas A. Connor, an engineer who has researched equestrian helmet safety and was a co-author of the study, said that the difficulty many Black riders had in finding helmets was "a big issue for a small amount of people."
"There's a real need to address it and absolutely zero desire to do it," he said. "If you owned a helmet company you could decide to solve this problem tomorrow."
Companies that make equipment used in other sports have taken steps to adapt helmets and other gear to accommodate Black athletes' natural hair.
Riddell, one of the leading manufacturers of helmets used by N.F.L. players, has developed a helmet with customized "precision-fit" padding, ensuring that any hairstyle will fit. And last year, the International Swimming Federation approved the Soul Cap, which accommodates thicker, curlier hair, for use in major competitions.
No Quick Fix
Equestrian helmet manufacturers say it is not as simple for them because the safety standards and certification-testing requirements are vastly different from other sports.
Laura Qusen, chief operating officer at Tipperary Equestrian, said she was not aware of the challenges Black riders faced in finding helmets until Ms. Robbins, the rider from Ontario, wrote to the company in January.
In an interview, Ms. Qusen acknowledged that it was "clearly not a one-person problem" and committed to investigating it further. But she worried that developing a new helmet would require new safety standards, potentially driving up the cost of a product for which there might not be much demand.
"If it's truly a manufacturing problem, anything is possible, but we're talking years of development," Ms. Qusen said.
The exchange with Ms. Qusen left Ms. Robbins in tears. She wondered if it was time to find a new sport, one that would make her feel like she mattered.
Charles Owen, a popular helmet company that sponsors Olympic athletes, is working on "several solutions" to help customers whose hairstyles often change and expects to introduce them sometime this year, Alex Burek, the company's marketing director, said. She declined to comment further.
But the riders' concerns have yet to reach Back on Track, a market leader that makes equestrian products, including helmets in a variety of shapes and sizes, with removable liners. In an interview, James Ruder, the chief executive, said the company's helmets can accommodate most riders. He added that he had "never once heard" about a Black rider struggling with helmet fit.
"If you have an 'oddity' -- and I don't mean to be disrespectful to the people who have weird hairstyles -- but if you have a hairstyle that impacts the functionality of the helmet, you might just have to change it," Mr. Ruder said.
In a follow-up interview, Mr. Ruder stood by his view that riders need to be aware that their hairstyle choices can affect helmet safety, and added that he intended no offense with his comments. "I'm bald, and some people find that weird," he said. "It's all relative."
'This Sport Isn't Designed for Us.'
Black riders say the manufacturers' responses demonstrate what they're up against.
"Sports were only developed for white people and they continue to keep white people protected," Ms. Robbins said. "People need to realize diversity and inclusion belongs anywhere, especially in sports."
A new helmet can't come fast enough for Aderes James, 10, of Bethesda, Md.
On competition mornings, the other girls on her hunter show team tuck their hair into their helmets to create a clean look that will impress the judges. Aderes follows a two-hour routine the night before with conditioners and detangler spray. Her mother then plaits her thick hair into two Dutch braids that fit under her helmet for the show ring.
"It makes me feel a little left out," Aderes said. "But it's the cost of healthy, curly hair."
Her mother, Rena Baxter James, said she and her husband made it a priority for Aderes to embrace her natural hair, but it often felt like an obstacle.
"You're asking people to change the texture of their hair instead of learning how to offer a proper fit," she said, adding that "mostly everything in this sport isn't designed for us."
'Like Reopening a Wound Every Time'
Chauntel Smith and Jenny Benton have become quite adept at manipulating young riders' heads into helmets.
The two co-founded a Minnesota nonprofit, CREW Urban Youth Equestrians, in 2021 to provide opportunities for Black youth and other children of color to learn about horses while developing tools to manage their emotions. Getting a helmet to work is often a time-consuming task that can take away from saddle time, they said.
"It's like reopening a wound every time," Ms. Smith, who is Black, said. "And it's so counterproductive to the purpose of why they are out here at the barn, to have a safe space."
Ms. Tillman, the aspiring equine veterinarian from Detroit, eventually replaced the helmet she'd stuffed with maxi pads with a new one, cutting pieces of the lining out until it nestled comfortably on her head. But now she worries.
"It makes me feel less comfortable about the safety of a helmet that I'm just doing this myself," she said. "It certainly doesn't make me feel included or that people with hair textures like mine are important."

Black Equestrians Want to Be Safe. But They Can’t Find Helmets.

Chanel Robbins has been riding horses most of her life, ever since her grandmother traded a cow from their family’s farm in Ontario for a pony when she was 7.
Galloping through the fields on her pony, Star, offered an escape from thoughts that weighed on her — that she didn’t have a relationship with her biological parents, for instance, or that she was the only Black girl in the neighborhood, aside from her sister.
About eight years ago, she reconnected with her father, a native of Jamaica. As the two grew closer, Robbins decided to style her hair in dreadlocks, like her dad. But there was a problem: Her riding helmet no longer fit, and she couldn’t find one that did.
“I finally freaking feel like myself, and now society is asking me to change,” Robbins, 27, of Alliston, Ontario, said as she choked back tears. “I just want to be able to ride.”
Black equestrians have long felt virtually invisible in a sport that remains overwhelmingly white. For those with natural hair, which for many is a declaration of pride and Black identity, finding a helmet that fits properly can be nearly impossible, creating yet another barrier to full inclusion. Some are now lobbying for change, mindful that horseback riding is among the leading causes of sports-related traumatic brain injury. Helmet companies say there isn’t a simple fix.
Among those raising awareness on social media is Caitlin Gooch, who grew up riding horses on her family’s farm in Wendell, North Carolina. For Gooch, 30, who wears her hair in locs that fall to her mid-back, safety has been of paramount concern because her father injured his neck in a fall from a horse when he was not wearing a helmet. When she has her hair redone, about once every two months, she brings her riding helmet with her to ensure it will still fit.
Around 2015, when she started teaching riding lessons, she found herself having to tell children they couldn’t ride if there was no helmet that properly fit them. In 2021, she started a hashtag, #saddleuphelmeton, to call attention to the problem.
Trying to stuff a head into a helmet that doesn’t fit presents a safety risk, not unlike “trying to fit a baby into a car seat that doesn’t fit them,” Gooch said. “The helmet just would not do what it was supposed to do.”
‘People Are Different, Hair Is Different’
Several prominent equestrian helmet manufacturers contacted by The New York Times said they were not aware that many Black riders struggled with helmet fit. Others said they recognized that it was an issue and were working to address it, while cautioning that bringing a new helmet to market is a costly undertaking that can take years.
The Times spoke with nearly a dozen Black riders, several of whom described searches for properly fitting helmets that dragged on for months or even years. Some said they had been turned away from equestrian stores by employees who said they couldn’t help them. A few said they had manipulated helmets by stuffing them or cutting the lining.
Isabella Tillman, who wears her hair in natural, buoyant curls in the summer and straightens it in the winter, is horrified when she thinks about the helmets she has used in 20 years of riding.
One sat atop her head like a traffic cone, she said. Another was so small it gave her headaches. And one was so big, she had to stuff it with maxi pads.
“There is nothing out there in the industry that is addressing these needs,” said Tillman, 29, of Detroit, who is working toward becoming an equine veterinarian. “People are different, hair is different and heads are different.”
‘A Big Issue for a Small Amount of People’
It is not clear exactly how many riders are affected. The U.S. Equestrian Federation, one of the major governing bodies overseeing competitive horse sports, does not require its 447,000 members to disclose their race, and only about half do so. Of those, nearly 92% are white, with Black riders making up only 0.5%.
Helmet inclusivity is important, Black equestrians said, because it could mean the difference between life and death. A 2019 study published in the journal Sports Medicine found that 70% of reported equestrian falls caused a head injury. Wearing a properly fitting helmet helped prevent more serious injuries, such as skull fractures, the study found.
Thomas A. Connor, an engineer who has researched equestrian helmet safety and was a co-author of the study, said that the difficulty many Black riders had in finding helmets was “a big issue for a small amount of people.”
“There’s a real need to address it and absolutely zero desire to do it,” he said. “If you owned a helmet company you could decide to solve this problem tomorrow.”
Companies that make equipment used in other sports have taken steps to adapt helmets and other gear to accommodate Black athletes’ natural hair.
Riddell, one of the leading manufacturers of helmets used by NFL players, has developed a helmet with customized “precision-fit” padding, ensuring that any hairstyle will fit. And last year, the International Swimming Federation approved the Soul Cap, which accommodates thicker, curlier hair, for use in major competitions.
No Quick Fix
Equestrian helmet manufacturers say it is not as simple for them because the safety standards and certification-testing requirements are vastly different from other sports.
Laura Qusen, chief operating officer at Tipperary Equestrian, said she was not aware of the challenges Black riders faced in finding helmets until Robbins, the rider from Ontario, wrote to the company in January.
In an interview, Qusen acknowledged that it was “clearly not a one-person problem” and committed to investigating it further. But she worried that developing a new helmet would require new safety standards, potentially driving up the cost of a product for which there might not be much demand.
“If it’s truly a manufacturing problem, anything is possible, but we’re talking years of development,” Qusen said.
The exchange with Qusen left Robbins in tears. She wondered if it was time to find a new sport, one that would make her feel like she mattered.
Charles Owen, a popular helmet company that sponsors Olympic athletes, is working on “several solutions” to help customers whose hairstyles often change and expects to introduce them sometime this year, Alex Burek, the company’s marketing director, said. She declined to comment further.
But the riders’ concerns have yet to reach Back on Track, a market leader that makes equestrian products, including helmets in a variety of shapes and sizes, with removable liners. In an interview, James Ruder, the chief executive, said the company’s helmets can accommodate most riders. He added that he had “never once heard” about a Black rider struggling with helmet fit.
“If you have an ‘oddity’ — and I don’t mean to be disrespectful to the people who have weird hairstyles — but if you have a hairstyle that impacts the functionality of the helmet, you might just have to change it,” Ruder said.
In a follow-up interview, Ruder stood by his view that riders need to be aware that their hairstyle choices can affect helmet safety, and added that he intended no offense with his comments. “I’m bald, and some people find that weird,” he said. “It’s all relative.”
‘This Sport Isn’t Designed for Us’
Black riders say the manufacturers’ responses demonstrate what they’re up against.
“Sports were only developed for white people and they continue to keep white people protected,” Robbins said. “People need to realize diversity and inclusion belongs anywhere, especially in sports.”
A new helmet can’t come fast enough for Aderes James, 10, of Bethesda, Maryland.
On competition mornings, the other girls on her hunter show team tuck their hair into their helmets to create a clean look that will impress the judges. Aderes follows a two-hour routine the night before with conditioners and detangler spray. Her mother then plaits her thick hair into two Dutch braids that fit under her helmet for the show ring.
“It makes me feel a little left out,” Aderes said. “But it’s the cost of healthy, curly hair.”
Her mother, Rena Baxter James, said she and her husband made it a priority for Aderes to embrace her natural hair, but it often felt like an obstacle.
“You’re asking people to change the texture of their hair instead of learning how to offer a proper fit,” she said, adding that “mostly everything in this sport isn’t designed for us.”
‘Like Reopening a Wound Every Time’
Chauntel Smith and Jenny Benton have become quite adept at manipulating young riders’ heads into helmets.
The two co-founded a Minnesota nonprofit, CREW Urban Youth Equestrians, in 2021 to provide opportunities for Black youth and other children of color to learn about horses while developing tools to manage their emotions. Getting a helmet to work is often a time-consuming task that can take away from saddle time, they said.
“It’s like reopening a wound every time,” Smith, who is Black, said. “And it’s so counterproductive to the purpose of why they are out here at the barn, to have a safe space.”

“It makes me feel less comfortable about the safety of a helmet that I’m just doing this myself,” she said. “It certainly doesn’t make me feel included or that people with hair textures like mine are important.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Where Wealth Meets Woo-Woo: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Even as a young girl, Elizabeth R. Koch was keenly aware of her family's extreme wealth.
"My beloved parents, they were paranoid about raising spoiled pieces of -- you know -- and so I heard about it a lot, and I could see how other people responded to us," she said. "I sensed it everywhere," she added. "I didn't get that it was about the family. I'm just seeing that it's about me. So I must be bad."
She decided to dedicate her life to one pursuit: "To not be hated," she said.
Ms. Koch, 47, is the daughter of Charles Koch, 87, the billionaire industrialist, climate change boogeyman and far-right political force. His wealth is estimated at roughly $ 66 billion. Ms. Koch is named after her mother, who goes by Liz. The family is close -- everyone spent Christmas together in Las Vegas, staying at the Wynn resort and taking in a mentalist show. But Ms. Koch, at least by her account, has been driven to the brink of insanity by her last name.
In a 2007 essay for Smith Magazine, she described her young adulthood as "panic attacks and meltdowns and doctors and pharmaceuticals and terrifying my parents and staring down that dark well of nothing you do will ever be good enough you privileged waste of flesh." A couple of years later, she lied to classmates at Syracuse University, where she was working on an M.F.A. in fiction, insisting that her name was pronounced "kotch," no relation to those "cokes," the ones they may have read sinister things about.
Ms. Koch's anguish may strike you as entirely understandable. Money can be corrosive, especially for the generation that didn't make it.
Or you may have the opposite reaction: It must be really, really hard -- eye roll -- to be an heiress to one of the biggest fortunes ever accumulated, who graduated from an Ivy League university (Princeton) and is now married to a successful biotech entrepreneur. They recently vacationed in Bali.
When Ms. Koch first came on my radar, I was firmly in the second camp.
A publicist named Scott Rowe had called to propose an article on Ms. Koch and her nonprofit organization, Unlikely Collaborators, which is all about self-investigation. According to its website, the organization is dedicated to the creation of "provocative experiences that help you face who you think you are." The site adds, "Our experiences use a process of self-investigation that encompasses principles and practices from eastern and western thought, meditation, psychology, and neuroscience -- designed to expand your understanding of self, others, and the whole damned world."
Oh, brother.
Mr. Rowe kept pushing, telling me that Ms. Koch started Unlikely Collaborators in 2021 after emerging from years of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, an eating disorder and a stint in a mental institution. Serious people have joined Unlikely Collaborators in leadership roles, including Lisa Gregorian, a former president of the Warner Bros. Television Group. So far, Unlikely Collaborators has given millions of dollars to various partners and earmarked at least $ 100 million for the next few years.
"Your perception is wrong," Mr. Rowe said. "Just come meet her."
Hugs, blankets and perception boxes
Unlikely Collaborators occupies a sunny loft in Santa Monica, Calif., a community once described as "where liberal ideology meets the sea." On the afternoon I visited, candles flickered here and there. Someone had put out what looked like 20 pounds of charcuterie. Ms. Gregorian, the nonprofit's president, was tucked into a stylish chair near Zach Goren, a former investment banker and private equity investor who is Ms. Koch's finance and operations chief.
Suddenly, Ms. Koch stood before me with outstretched arms, soliciting a hug. "Before we begin," she said, "would you like a blanket?"
I declined, and we settled into a conference room. I expected her to be guarded, in keeping with her father's approach to the news media. Instead, she spoke excitedly for nearly two hours -- telling me about her circuitous path to middle age, salting her sentences with profanity and referring to herself as a "privileged, pasty, white girl from the Midwest." She talked about exploring "pain holes" with a therapist and going on two-week silent retreats. She insisted that she was "apolitical."
Mostly, Ms. Koch wanted to explain something called the Perception Box, a term she trademarked in 2021. Unlikely Collaborators is built around the concept, which Ms. Koch wants to use to prompt a global movement of self-investigation.
"We all live inside an invisible but ever-present mental box -- a Perception Box," Ms. Koch began. "This box distorts our perceptions of everything and everyone around us. It distorts our ability to understand other people, to see them clearly, to connect with them. And it distorts our ability to really even know ourselves."
She adjusted the blanket on her lap.
"Most of the external conflict, messiness and miscommunication in the world -- in corporations, in relationships, in families, in every aspect of our lives -- is caused by internal conflict," Ms. Koch continued. "And most of the internal conflict is caused by unconscious beliefs that we have been carrying around since we are very young -- like zero to 5 -- and that we project on everyone around us."
Unlikely Collaborators intends to help people become aware of their Perception Boxes through workshops, lectures and summits. (In 2021, Ms. Koch led a workshop for the Los Angeles chapter of the Red Cross. More recently, she has been offering a workshop titled "What I Think You Think About Me.") Unlikely Collaborators also plans to publish books and, eventually, produce films with Perception Box themes.
In addition, Unlikely Collaborators invests in companies and nonprofit organizations that are aligned with its mission, Ms. Koch said. She helped fund and hopes to develop curriculum for Moral Courage College, which describes its purpose as training people to "lower their emotional defenses so that contentious issues can be turned into constructive conversations." Millions of dollars have gone to SIY Global, a firm that provides mindfulness and emotional intelligence training. Ms. Koch and Unlikely Collaborators have also donated money to the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which, among other things, conducts research into the mental health benefits of MDMA, the club drug popularly known as Ecstasy and Molly.
"I know this is a lot to throw at people," Ms. Koch said, apparently reading my mind. "Let's go back to Perception Box. That's where it begins and ends."
She jumped to her feet and started writing on a white board, calling out each word with a flourish in a demonstration of one of her workshops.
"I don't matter."
"I'm not good enough."
"I'm bad."
She asked me to envision a person -- a writer, perhaps. This person misses deadlines because they are "constantly worrying about making it perfect," she said. "It has to be better. It has to be better. No, no, no. Not there yet." That thinking can be painful and ultimately even professionally paralyzing.
"That person is running a Perception Box story in their head," she said, "and it's an obvious one: I'm not good enough."
I grimaced and told her that I could be that writer.
"Who are you still trying to please, and who are you still rebelling against?" she asked me, now firmly in teacher-student mode.
I squirmed and thought about how it was really stupid of me to say no to that blanket.
"Probably Daddy," I said, almost in a whisper.
She sighed and sat down.
"I have that issue too," she said. "I've done a lot of work on it. A lot of love there. But, yeah."
'Hippy dippy woo-woo'
In 2009, Charles Koch was in the hospital. He was getting a shoulder replaced, and his daughter was at his bedside. She had become interested in neuroplasticity -- the brain's ability to change and reorganize thought patterns -- and wanted to discuss her early findings.
"Are you sure you're busy enough?" he said.
People who prattle on about "wellness" and self-investigation can be exhausting: Oh no, not another trendy product or program or yoga class or brain exercise or therapy or gauzy self-help book. McKinsey & Company estimates that wellness is a $ 1.5 trillion global industry, with annual growth of up to 10 percent. Sleep consultants. Ketamine clinics. Cleanses, detoxes, neutraceuticals. Meditation apps. Wellness tourism. Instagram influencers peddling holistic everything.
Perception Box?
"Some of what I hear about in the wellness space makes my eyes roll," said Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, a neuroscientist and professor of psychology at Northeastern University. "As far as I can tell, Elizabeth is trying really hard to make sure everything she does is consistent with our best available guess of what's going on scientifically."
Dr. Barrett's research lab at Northeastern has received grant funding from Unlikely Collaborators, and she is now a paid adviser to the organization.
The women got to know each other in 2018, when Ms. Koch invited Dr. Barrett to attend an Unlikely Collaborators retreat. Dr. Barrett had just written the book "How Emotions Are Made," and Ms. Koch was formulating her Perception Box ideas, in part by funding research into emotions and consciousness. In 2014, Ms. Koch started Tiny Blue Dot, a research foundation, and hired Christof Koch (no relation) to run it; he is also a former president of the Allen Institute for Brain Science, where he continues to serve as a chief scientist, in Seattle.
Ms. Koch is self-conscious about coming across as one of those "hippy dippy woo-woo people," as she put it. But there is also no way around it: Ms. Koch is a bit woo-woo, even by California standards. She seeks out the occasional shaman. As part of her own mental health journey, she has explored psychedelics as medicine. Psychedelics remain mostly illegal, but regulators are moving toward the approval of MDMA and psilocybin, the psychoactive component in magic mushrooms, as therapist-supervised treatments for post-traumatic stress and depression.
"When I did my own MDMA therapy, there were Looney Tunes characters coming out of my body," Ms. Koch told me matter-of-factly. "The witch, Sylvester, that viking chick who sings the opera. When I was little and forming my Perception Box, I sucked them in somehow."
This is the offspring of Charles Koch?
Mr. Koch declined to be interviewed. In an email, he said he was "delighted" and "couldn't be more proud" that his daughter had "dedicated her life to making the world a better place for everyone."
"We wanted our kids to discover their gifts and where they could passionately apply them to help others improve their lives," he said. "For most of us, this takes time and involves struggle and trial and error. Our children were no exceptions."
Life with father
Ms. Koch's fascination -- some might say obsession -- with self identity and perception started when she was growing up in Wichita, Kan. She attended private school, as did her brother, Chase, who is two years younger. (He runs Koch Disruptive Technologies, a venture capital firm connected to Koch Industries, a constellation of businesses that include oil refineries, medical devices, fertilizer, chemicals, paper products and batteries.)
"It's not like growing up in New York City, where a lot of people are wealthy," she said. "We were very different in Wichita. I had so much fear that people would hate me."
As an adult, she said, therapists helped her realize that much of what she was telling herself was not real. Most of her anguish, she explained, "had to do with my own stories about never being good enough, the ones I made up in my head -- that's where I got trapped."
As she worked to untangle her knots, she did a lot of searching. She was an editor for a literary humor magazine called Opium. She tried to write a novel. (She's still trying. "It's about 1,400 pages with 24 major characters and 30 plot lines.") She went to Peru to experience ayahuasca, the vomit-inducing hallucinogenic tea. Another time, she found herself at a nudist colony. In 2015, she started a book imprint called Catapult. "Cries for Help, Various" was its first title. (This month, Catapult shut down its online magazine and writing program to "ensure a successful future" for its core book business.)
Ms. Koch also dabbled in film finance, serving as an executive producer for "Beasts of No Nation," starring Idris Elba, and "Harriet," which was nominated for two Oscars.
I found her easygoing and upbeat. She laughed when I asked how much money she had inherited. (I pressed, and, Mr. Rowe, seated nearby, piped up with "no comment.") One minute Ms. Koch was serious, talking about criminal justice reform, which is a focus of her father's philanthropy, and the next she was frivolous, telling me about a design studio in Scotland that sells fancy wallpaper.
There was one exception to Ms. Koch's sunny, let-it-all-hang-out demeanor: when I tried to dig into her relationship with her father, whom she calls Pop, and asked what direct role he might have played in her feeling "never good enough" from such a young age. During one of our conversations, she spoke about him pushing her to join the track team in the fourth grade and personally coaching her for a couple of years. "No matter where we went on vacation, he was getting me up at 5 a.m. to run," she said. In the winter, sometimes while it was snowing, "he would be driving beside me in the car, and, like, usually playing some economics tape, trying to get me to learn while I was running."
Were his expectations too high?
"There is no blame there," she responded, with some steel in her voice. "I was just confused, and I was putting things together in a really distorted way. And then I had so much shame about it that I couldn't talk about it."
Mr. Koch said in an email, "When the kids were young, I pushed them to work hard and be the best them they could be. That's the job of a parent -- to help their children realize their full potential and live a life of meaning."
No stranger to division
It is possible that Ms. Koch will turn Unlikely Collaborators and her Perception Box credo into a success. "This isn't a three-to-five-year plan," said Mr. Goren, the financial and operations chief. "She has a multi-decade vision."
But she will never escape the Koch box. Some people will always want something from her that she is either uninterested or unwilling to give -- allyship in a fight against her father's politics, in particular his opposition to climate change laws.
"It's Time to Hold Elizabeth Koch Accountable for Her Family's Role in the Climate Crisis," read a headline on a Medium article last year.
"She's never said or done anything to distance herself from her family," Hilary Plum, an author and academic, wrote in Fence, a nonprofit literary magazine. "Any Koch we want to work with must be a black sheep, an anti-Koch."
Ms. Gregorian, the former Warner Bros. executive and Unlikely Collaborators president, knows that the Kochs are radioactive in certain circles. But because of that very reason, she said Ms. Koch was uniquely suited to lead conversations about bridging divides.
"Coming from Hollywood, so much of my world was manufactured authenticity -- completely and utterly manufactured," Ms. Gregorian said. "With Elizabeth, what you see is what you get, which is part of what gives her this incredible ability to connect with people."
"I was skeptical when I met her," Ms. Gregorian added. "And then I just opened up to her, as if she had hypnotized me."

Full text: After a $ 22.8 billion loss, Warren Buffett called the figure "100 percent misleading" and urged shareholders to focus on his empire's overall health.
Not even Warren E. Buffett, one of the world's most successful investors, was immune last year to whipsawing markets.
But as his conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, reported a big loss, the billionaire executive urged shareholders to focus on the long term and the underlying health of his empire, which includes insurance, railroads, energy and stock holdings in the likes of Coca-Cola, American Express and more.
Berkshire reported on Saturday that it lost $ 22.8 billion last year, driven by $ 53.6 billion in unrealized losses on its investments. That mirrored the experience of other investors, who were hit by market volatility as inflation rose swiftly and central banks responded by rapidly raising interest rates.
But in his annual letter to shareholders, Mr. Buffett pointed to the company's operating earnings, which are drawn from its underlying businesses and exclude those paper investment values. On that basis, Berkshire earned a record $ 30.8 billion last year.
And its holdings of cash and equivalents have grown to $ 125 billion, giving Mr. Buffett more firepower to invest in stocks and, potentially, buy new companies.
Factoring Berkshire's investment performance into its overall returns is "100 percent misleading," Mr. Buffett wrote, since those results are likely to change easily quarter to quarter.
Berkshire's vast business empire is often seen as a microcosm of American industry. And many of its subsidiaries reported being hurt by the broader economic forces affecting the country.
Weaknesses included Berkshire's consumer products businesses, which reported a 23 percent drop in earnings last year from 2021, hurt by lower demand and higher costs for raw materials and shipping. In its annual report, Berkshire said that it expected continued soft demand in 2023 and that it planned to "right size" its operations and reduce product inventories.
The conglomerate's core insurance businesses, which generate the cash that powers Mr. Buffett's vast investments, also reported underwriting losses from catastrophic events, like hurricanes, and a rise in auto claims at Geico.
And BNSF Railway reported a slight drop in earnings, in large part because of the rising cost of fuel and lower volumes of shipments.
Still, in his annual letter to shareholders -- a must read for scores of investors, eager to glean his thoughts on the global state of affairs -- Mr. Buffett professed continued faith in the resilience of the United States.
"We count on the American Tailwind and, though it has been becalmed from time to time, its propelling force has always returned," he wrote. "I have yet to see a time when it made sense to make a long-term bet against America."
Much of the letter was spent defending Berkshire's practices.
That included share buybacks, on which the company spent $ 7.9 billion last year. The practice has drawn criticism from lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who argue that it diverts money to Wall Street investors instead of to employee pay raises or new investments.
"When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to C.E.O.s, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive)," Mr. Buffett wrote.
He also defended Berkshire's federal tax bill, amid ongoing criticism that he himself pays little in taxes relative to his overall wealth, which Forbes estimates at $ 106 billion. In his letter, Mr. Buffett said that Berkshire had paid $ 32 billion in federal taxes over the past decade, representing a tenth of 1 percent of all taxes that the government collected during that time.
"Had there been roughly 1,000 taxpayers in the U.S. matching Berkshire's payments, no other businesses nor any of the country's 131 million households would have needed to pay any taxes to the federal government," he wrote. "Not a dime."
Mr. Buffett added a criticism of the federal government for spending significantly more than it collects in taxes, touching on a fight now bubbling in Washington over the debt ceiling. "Huge and entrenched fiscal deficits have consequences," he wrote.

Big Soda's Hard Turn: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. -- On a quiet street corner, a sign marks the birthplace of a beverage behemoth: Here, in 1954, the Tri-City Beverage Corporation bottled its first case of Mountain Dew.
The soda was originally uncolored and lemon-lime flavored, and its inventors used it as a mixer with bourbon. "Mountain dew" is also a nickname for moonshine, which farmers sometimes processed from leftover crops. Labels on early soda bottles promised it was "specially blended in the traditional hillbilly style."
It wasn't until after PepsiCo bought the company in 1964 and eventually built a global youth-oriented brand, one marketed by extreme sports athletes, that the soft drink left its Appalachian roots behind.
In a way, Mountain Dew came full-circle last year when PepsiCo turned the brand toward a new alcoholic beverage: Hard Mtn Dew. At a One Stop Wine and Spirits frequented by students from East Tennessee State University, the new 24-ounce cans are prominently displayed. Although the brew bears little resemblance to its ancestor, its alcoholic content is "exactly what Mountain Dew is all about," Charles Gordon Jr., owner of Tri-City Beverage, said.
Hard Mtn Dew reflects a major change in the alcohol industry, which for the last century mainly produced drinks categorized as beer, wine or spirits. In recent years, those lines have blurred, and a fourth category of ready-to-drink beverages has emerged -- hard seltzers and other flavored malt beverages, wine coolers and canned cocktails. Although these products differ in primary ingredients and how the alcohol is processed, all typically are flavored and packaged for casual consumption.
This isn't the first time a new type of alcoholic beverage exploded in popularity but some earlier fads were associated with single products like Zima, Smirnoff Ice or Four Loko. "It's only really in the last three to four years that it's become a major category," Nadine Sarwat, a beverage analyst at Bernstein Research, said.
Sales of hard seltzers and ready-to-drink canned cocktails were valued at nearly $ 10 billion in 2021 by the Grand View Research firm, which expects them to grow by double digits in coming years. And in a major shift, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have debuted alcoholic products in the U.S. market. In February, Monster Beverage, a maker of energy drinks, began rolling out its first line of alcoholic drinks called The Beast Unleashed.
But as alcohol-related deaths in America reach record highs, regulators and public health experts are voicing concern that the new class of drinks and the expanding industry could alter how people buy and drink alcohol. Some also expressed worry that the convenience of the new products could reverse the long-term decline in alcohol consumption by young people. And recent studies show that consuming even one alcoholic drink a day increases a person's risk of cancer and heart disease.
Coca-Cola and Monster Beverage declined repeated requests for comment, and PepsiCo referred questions about products bearing its brands to the independent companies that it had licensed to manufacture and market them.
Pamela Trangenstein, a scientist with the alcohol research group at the Public Health Institute in California, recently supervised a study at college football games. She described a sea of empty White Claw hard seltzer cans covering the floor of a student section at one stadium.
"The carbonation and sugar content can make it taste like you aren't drinking alcohol," she said.
A tantalizing opportunity
Americans' drinking habits have been shifting over time. The popular practice of avoiding calories and carbs has been driving down beer's market share for years, said Bonnie Herzog, a Goldman Sachs managing director who analyzes the beverage industry. At the same time, alcohol companies are vying to win back people under 30, who are consuming less alcohol than previous generations at that age. And the coronavirus pandemic supercharged sales of portable products as consumers sought beverages they could drink at home.
"Health and wellness, variety, convenience -- that's the appeal," Ms. Herzog said.
Hard Mtn Dew exemplifies these trends. It is sugar- and caffeine-free, and taps into consumers' connection to a brand they've known for years. Although the new product is 5 percent alcohol by volume, a 24-ounce can contains the equivalent of two standard drinks. Fans who got an early taste seemed to like it. "I drank Hard Mountain Dew and felt like I was staring at God," an online reviewer wrote.
Major alcohol producers like Anheuser-Busch InBev and Diageo have invested heavily in this category, but the moment has also presented traditional soda makers with a tantalizing new market, Ms. Herzog said. In addition, manufacturers and distributors make a higher profit per case of alcoholic beverages than for nonalcoholic drinks, according to Kevin Asato, a beverage industry consultant.
In 2018, Coca-Cola dipped a toe in the market when it introduced Lemon-Dou in Japan, the first hard drink among its brands since the 1980s. In 2020, the company paired with Molson Coors Brewing Co. to make Topo Chico Hard Seltzers, and last year, Coca-Cola entered into agreements to produce Fresca Mixed cocktails, Simply Spiked Lemonade and a canned Jack & Coke.
On an earnings call on Feb. 14, James Quincey, chief executive of Coca-Cola, cited its "early alcohol experiments" like Jack & Coke, scheduled for sale in California at the end of next month, as a way for the company to be "a total beverage company -- everywhere."
By licensing its soft drink brands to established alcohol makers for sale through existing distributors, Coca-Cola kept within the lanes of the regulatory firewalls that separate alcohol producers, distributors and retailers. This three-tier system has characterized the U.S. alcohol industry since the repeal of Prohibition and is intended to prevent a single company from vertically integrating and suppressing its competitors.
PepsiCo, in contrast, has attached fewer of its brands to new alcoholic drinks -- just Hard Mtn Dew and Lipton Hard Iced Tea, so far -- but has shown greater willingness to disrupt the status quo.
The company established a wholly owned subsidiary, Blue Cloud Distribution, to keep more control over sales and marketing, and a greater share of the profits. The venture involved hiring more than 250 employees, obtaining individual state licenses to distribute alcohol and a fleet of trucks.
To comply with the three-tier system, PepsiCo licensed Mountain Dew's brand to the Boston Beer Co. and provided it with Mountain Dew flavoring. That way, PepsiCo is independent from production and can instead control distribution.
Not all states have approved of the arrangement. Last spring, regulators in Kentucky and Georgia denied Blue Cloud distributor licenses, ruling that Blue Cloud had blurred the lines between manufacturer and distributor. Indiana regulators denied Blue Cloud a comparable license last month.
Jeff Birnbaum, a spokesman for Blue Cloud, pointed out that Hard Mtn Dew and Lipton Hard Iced Tea are both manufactured and marketed by separate companies, in accordance with the three-tier system.
Local beer distributors have also tried to block the new competition. In October, beer wholesalers in Nevada and Virginia filed complaints with regulators asking them to revoke Blue Cloud's licenses.
And in December, independent beer distributors appealed to federal regulators, calling on the Treasury Department's alcohol and tobacco tax bureau to investigate whether retailers were giving soft drink companies more favorable treatment of their alcoholic products. Soda companies routinely pay retailers so-called slotting fees for prominent placement of their products, but doing so for alcoholic beverages would violate the three-tier system, the distributors argued.
They also provided photographs of what they called "inappropriate placement" of Hard Mtn Dew in stores, shown next to children's juice boxes and toy cars.
Mr. Birnbaum, a spokesman for Blue Cloud, said the company did not dictate to retailers how to display its drinks, but urged them to avoid confusing alcoholic and nonalcoholic products and to correct improper placement. He also noted Hard Mtn Dew was priced and packaged in line with other malt-based ready-to-drink alcohol beverages, and "boldly says on its label that it is for individuals 21 and older."
Mary Ryan, administrator of the alcohol tax and trade bureau, said her office had not received evidence of any violations. The bureau is accepting public comments until June 7 on whether it should revise regulations that assess the independence of retailers, among others.
Ms. Sarwat, the beverage analyst, expressed doubt that the tactics employed by Blue Cloud and PepsiCo would lead to abandoning the three-tier regulatory system -- but she didn't dismiss their influence.
"Any time Pepsi or Coke do anything, given how deep their pockets are, it is one to watch closely," she said.
The effects on health
Excess drinking already kills more than 140,000 Americans each year, according to the latest estimates, far surpassing drug overdoses or firearm deaths.
Alcohol experts take heart at the growing ranks of openly "sober-curious" young people, and beverage companies are trying to tap that group with a profusion of new nonalcoholic products, including zero-proof wines and nonalcoholic aperitivos. But some public health experts have expressed concerns that the widening variety of alcoholic drinks could reverse those trends.
The long-term effects on drinking habits will not be known for years, according to Matt Rossheim, an associate professor at the University of North Texas Health Science Center. "In public health, it's constantly this game of Whac-A-Mole, as industry is just so quick to innovate and launch things, and then it takes us years and years to figure out what happened," he said.
Of the few government surveys measuring drinking behaviors, none collect detailed data on the new alcoholic beverages, Marissa Esser, who leads the alcohol program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said.
The Monitoring the Future survey, which measures substance use among eighth-, 10th- and 12th-grade U.S. students, will include questions about hard seltzers and ready-to-drink cocktails for the first time this fall.
Because these types of drinks tend to be inexpensive, packaged in single-serve containers and sold in places like gas stations and convenience stores, they are likely to appeal to young people, Mr. Rossheim suggested.
Industry executives acknowledged the marketing benefit that springboards off familiar brands. On an earnings call in November, Rodney Sacks, the chief executive of Monster Beverage, pointed out that the new line's products featured "mean green," "white haze," "peach perfect" and "scary berries" -- all "based on Monster's well known and popular flavor profiles."
And women are a coveted consumer. Katherine Keyes, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, said the push into hard sodas appeared to target the female drinker, whose alcohol intake has been catching up to men's in recent years. "A low-calorie, flavored alcohol beverage has been their tried-and-true approach to attracting a female market," she said.
Still, these options should not be marketed as healthy alternatives, experts said.
"The harms from alcohol don't mainly come from calories," Bill Kerr, a senior scientist at the Public Health Institute's alcohol research program, said. "They come from the alcohol."

Richard Belzer, 78, Comic and TV Sleuth Whose Character Popped Up Everywhere: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A stand-up comic, he called his hard-boiled character on the long-running TV drama "Lenny Bruce with a badge."
Richard Belzer, who became one of American television's most enduring police detectives as John Munch on "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit" and several other shows, died on Sunday at his home in Beaulieu-sur-Mer, France. He was 78.
The death was confirmed by Bill Scheft, a friend of Mr. Belzer. Mr. Scheft, who has been working on a documentary about Mr. Belzer's life and career, said that the actor had suffered from circulatory and respiratory issues for years.
As Detective Munch, Mr. Belzer was brainy but hard-boiled, cynical but sensitive. He wore sunglasses at night and listened to the horror stories of rape victims in stony silence. He was the kind of cop who made casual references to Friedrich Nietzsche and the novelist Elmore Leonard. He spoke in quips; when accused of being a dirty old man, he responded: "Who are you calling old?"
In a 2010 interview with AARP The Magazine, Mr. Belzer -- who was a stand-up comic when he was not playing Munch -- described his television alter ego as "Lenny Bruce with a badge."
With Munch, Mr. Belzer found phenomenal success. In 2013, when the character was written out of "SVU" -- as the "Law & Order" spinoff is often called -- Mr. Belzer wrote in The Huffington Post that he had appeared as Munch in more than 500 hours of programming on 10 different shows.
The character's run began in 1993, on "Homicide: Life on the Street," and included guest appearances on "Sesame Street" and "30 Rock."
At his retirement, Mr. Belzer was often described as the actor with the longest run playing the same character on television, as well as the actor who had played the same character on the largest number of different shows.
A life of mistreatment, misbehavior and missed opportunities prepared Mr. Belzer for his star turn as a streetwise detective.
Richard Jay Belzer was born on Aug. 4, 1944, in Bridgeport, Conn. He grew up in a housing project in the city. His father, Charles, co-owned a wholesale tobacco and candy distributor, and his mother, Frances (Gurfein) Belzer, was a homemaker.
"Our mother didn't know how to love her sons appropriately," Leonard, Mr. Belzer's brother and a fellow comedian, told People magazine in 1993. "She always had some rationale for hitting us."
Richard added, "My kitchen was the toughest room I ever worked. I had to make my mom laugh or I'd get my ass kicked."
She died of cancer, and Charles died by suicide before Mr. Belzer turned 25. Leonard jumped from the roof of his Upper West Side apartment building and died in 2014.
Mr. Belzer routinely fought authority. "I was thrown out of every school I ever went to," he told AARP. He served in the army for a little under a year, then received a discharge on psychiatric grounds after repeatedly injuring himself.
He went on to work as a truck driver, jewelry salesman, dress salesman, dock worker, census taker and reporter for The Bridgeport Post. In that job, he dreamed of becoming a serious writer -- but instead spent his free time dealing drugs.
In 1971, Mr. Belzer answered an ad in The Village Voice for auditions for a sketch show, and soon enough he found himself performing stand-up. In 1975, he began working as a warm-up comic for the "Saturday Night Live" audience, but his friend Lorne Michaels did not invite him to join the cast. Mr. Belzer accused Mr. Michaels of breaking a promise to him -- a charge Mr. Michaels did not comment on to People.
Absent fame or fortune, Mr. Belzer became the bohemian prince of New York City comedy. His fans included Robert De Niro, John Belushi and Richard Pryor. Mr. Belzer gained renown for working the crowd, which often meant insults -- labeling, for instance, the bejeweled get-up of a drunk audience member as "Aztec pimp" -- but could also include his attempting to start a brawl.
He held court at an Upper East Side club called Catch a Rising Star, where he was given an hourlong slot on a nightly basis. In 1981, a Rolling Stone profile described him as spending his final three dollars on a taxi to his set, performing while on quaaludes and mocking a famous talent manager in the audience.
"On the outside, he was still 'The Belz,' in shades and black leather punk jacket, coke-dealer thin, lupine, always cool and relentlessly self-assured," David Hirshey and Jay Lovinger wrote. But on the inside, he was "scared" -- 37 years old and still struggling to afford meals.
His life began turning around in the mid-1980s, when Mr. Belzer survived testicular cancer, quit drugs and married Harlee McBride, a former Playboy model and actress.
In 1990, he found financial stability in a characteristically absurd and brutal fashion. Five years earlier, Hulk Hogan, demonstrating a wrestling move on Mr. Belzer on TV, knocked out the comic and dropped him headfirst to the ground. An out-of-court settlement enabled Mr. Belzer and Ms. McBride to buy a home in France, which they called variously the Hulk Hogan Estate and Chez Hogan.
His career took off after he began appearing as Detective Munch on "Homicide," when he was nearly 50 years old.
Mr. Belzer's first two marriages -- to Gail Susan Ross and Dalia Danoch -- ended in divorce. He is survived by Ms. McBride; two stepdaughters, Bree and Jessica Benton; and six step-grandchildren.
Mr. Belzer came to own two homes in the south of France, and he built a basketball court at one of them. He enjoyed shooting baskets and waiting for one of his dogs to collect the rebounds. He read up on Roman history and visited ancient ruins.
At the start of his career in television, he spoke happily about leaving behind his romantic, rough-and-tumble years in stand-up comedy.
"I tell you," he said to People, "I won't miss making drunks laugh at 2 in the morning."

'Party Down' Is Back. Did You R.S.V.P.?: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Author: Soloski, Alexis

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The invitations have been sent, the appetizers plated, the bottles opened. Rows of glasses gleam like baby stars. And somewhere, on the fringes of the celebration, a cater waiter is about to do something very wrong.
This was the template of "Party Down," a Starz comedy that ran for two 10-episode seasons, debuting in the spring of 2009. Canceled just as critics and niche audiences were beginning to catch on, the show followed the disaffected employees of a mid-tier catering company as they moved from party to party, one per episode, filching booze, seducing guests, snorting coke, flirting with Nazism and accidentally poisoning George Takei.
The original 20 episodes never included a surprise party. But get your streamers and party blowers ready. Because in a surprise to just about everyone -- most likely including the folks at Nielsen, who once awarded the show's finale a 0.0 rating among 18- to 49-year-olds -- "Party Down" is back. A six-episode revival will premiere on Starz on Feb. 24, with new episodes arriving weekly.
Martin Starr, a returning cast member, seemed to genuinely marvel at the development.
"This was the only show I've worked on where people came to work when they weren't working," he said in a group video call. "It's crazy that we get to come back and do it again."
"Truth be told," his co-star Ken Marino said, "the reason I came back to set when I wasn't working is I was between homes."
Starr: "I do remember you were finding places to go to the bathroom that maybe didn't have your name."
Marino: "I still do. I'm going to the bathroom right now."
Is this the same "Party Down" that failed to dominate cable television over a dozen years ago? Mostly. The show's original creators, John Enbom, Dan Etheridge, Rob Thomas and Paul Rudd, remain, as executive producers, and Enbom oversees a small staff of writers. The party-a-week structure also endures, as does the original cast -- with the exception, based on the five episodes provided in advance, of Lizzy Caplan.
"All of us, for the entire 13 years since we stopped shooting the show, all we wanted to do is make more 'Party Down,"' the show's lead, Adam Scott ("Parks and Recreation," "Severance"), said in a separate interview last month. "We all would have been there for free."
But the world has changed in the dozen or so years since the original run was canceled. So have the actors. Unknowns or barely knowns when the show debuted, most have since become household names. (The others? Depends on the household.) And they've all seen the current crop of disappointing reboots and reprises. "Party Down" could just be the rare show to get it right, mixing the perfect cocktail of star power, nostalgia, growth and gags.
Then again, the characters never put a lot of muscle into bartending. So here's a Zen koan for a deeply un-Zen show: Can you throw the same party twice?
Are we having fun yet?
The first run of "Party Down" was both structural marvel and joke spectacular. Each episode was simultaneously a workplace comedy, a hangout comedy and a procedural -- a sitcom that never sat down. The celebrations it featured -- birthdays, after parties -- typically bordered the entertainment industry and nearly all of the cater waiters harbored industry dreams of their own.
Those dreams eluded them, which fueled the philosophical inquiry at the show's center.
"What we were asking was: How long do you chase the dream?" Thomas, one of the creators, said. "When do you grow up? When do you quit banging your head against the wall?"
The "Party Down" staff are all trying to make it, as actors, screenwriters and comedians. (Marino's Ron, the manager, has a different dream: a Soup 'R Crackers franchise.) Only Henry (Scott), who has traded beer-commercial celebrity for free-floating despair, has opted out. The actors were trying back then to make it, too. None of the original cast -- Caplan, Ryan Hansen, Jane Lynch, Marino, Scott, Starr -- were anything like famous when the show began. Acting in a comedy about the entertainment industry's has-beens, also-rans and never-wills resonated with the cast, sometimes uncomfortably.
"It felt so close to home, this show, because I felt like I could be a caterer the next day easily," Hansen said.
Scott, who at the time had yet to play a lead, then shared that sense of career tenuousness. The cast felt deeply connected to the show in those first seasons, he said, and protective of it. "We just wanted to do it forever, because it made us feel better," he said. "It really did."
The salaries, though small, kept a few of the actors on the sunny side of financial precarity. The camaraderie helped, too. (That camaraderie remains; I had four of the actors together on a video call, and I have never heard grown men exchange so many "Love yous.") Several actors separately compared the original shoot to summer camp.
That genuine affection altered the show's tone. Some first season episodes included "edgy" humor -- gay jokes, post-racial jokes. ("It's cringey, yeah," Starr said.) But the creators quickly realized they didn't need that edge. The show was sadder than that. Funnier, too. The characters are screw-ups, sure, but the show suggests that everyone is a screw-up, especially after an hour at an open bar. So maybe the best thing is to find common cause as you pass the hors d'oeuvres.
"It's about people who think that they're going to find happiness in something out there," Lynch said. "But what they have right in front of them is really quite sweet."
Lynch shot the first eight episodes. Then she had to leave for the Fox show "Glee." Marino hired a stripper for her wrap party. The stripper, Lynch recalled, smelled of French fries. The show went on, with Jennifer Coolidge replacing Lynch for two episodes and Megan Mullally, the only actor who was already well-known, coming in for the final 10.
The creators believed that it would keep going, even though, according to Nielsen, the Season 2 finale attracted only 74,000 viewers. Starz had other plans. Those plans didn't involve letting the creators take the show elsewhere. "Party Down" languished.
One decade, zero dinners
If the original run argued that it's healthier to let some dreams die, the creators and the cast could never quite manage that. There were talks, every year or so, of getting the crew back together -- for a special, for a movie, for a move to another network. Friends and fans often asked Marino about it.
"I was like, 'They're working on it,"' he said. "'It's going to happen! Right around the corner!"' It took him eight or nine years to accept that maybe that corner wasn't coming.
Then in 2019, Starz appointed Jeffrey Hirsch as its new president and chief executive. Thomas reached out to Hirsch and began pitching the show again. Hard. This time, Starz said yes.
That was only the first hurdle. The actors had conflicts and prior commitments now. The revival was approved in the summer of 2021, with production scheduled for early 2022. Lynch was to begin rehearsing a Broadway musical. Scott was making the Apple TV+ show "Severance." Mullally had booked a movie being shot in Idaho.
Somehow a six-week window was found, even though that window involved flying Mullally to Los Angeles every weekend and back to Sun Valley by Monday.
"We could never get together for dinner for a decade," Etheridge, a creator, said. "But when we came to shoot the show, everybody was there."
Everybody except for Caplan, who had signed onto the FX series "Fleishman Is in Trouble." (Asked whether Caplan might make a surprise appearance in Episode 6, Starz declined to comment.) Enbom had originally structured this new season around the on-again-off-again relationship between Henry and Caplan's Casey. He had to restructure it, adding a new character, a studio executive played by Jennifer Garner. The revival's first episode takes time out to heckle Caplan: Casey, now a successful comedian, can't make a crew reunion.
"She's shooting in New York," Starr's Roman, still an aspiring "hard sci-fi" writer, says. "Too big time for the likes of us."
There were fewer jokes in real life. Hansen tried to make light of the situation. "Listen, we get it," he said. "She had a job, whatever. I mean, I personally turned down a Marvel movie to do 'Party Down."'
"Tell that to everybody," he added.
But just about everyone described themselves as heartbroken, including Caplan. "If I think about it for too long, I start to cry," she wrote in an email. She sent cupcakes to the shoot.
The bow tie abides
Hollywood has transformed in the years since "Party Down" first concluded, and in some ways the show has, too. Gratuitous boobs are gone now. And the catering crew, once blindingly white, has become more diverse with the inclusion of two new regulars: Sackson, a YouTube-style content creator played by Tyrel Jackson Williams, and Lucy, a chef played by Zoë Chao who styles herself as a "food artist."
Yet, the sweet-sour, slightly funky flavor of "Party Down" -- like a margarita made with off-brand liquor -- is mostly unaltered. This seems to be the rare revival that understands what made the original work, yet can still move (or move just enough to include the occasional TikTok dance challenge) with the times.
"We kept doing what we'd always been doing, just with new details," Enbom said. "Because society certainly has not changed into a more wholesome place."
Have the returning characters changed? That depends on how much you and your therapist believe that change is possible. "They're still the same lovable knuckleheads," Mullally said. "Most of these people haven't really moved on, or they haven't really become any happier, or more fulfilled in their lives."
Slinging hors d'oeuvres hits different and more darkly in midlife. Still, the creators and the cast didn't want the revival to feel like a bummer.
"It's going to be fun watching the characters try to claw their way toward something other than their current circumstances," Scott promised.
And if not exactly "fun," then certainly relatable. "Really who gets what they want in this life?" Lynch said.
She probably meant that rhetorically. But the "Party Down" die-hards, Lynch included, did get what they wanted, a third season. And they seem to have delighted in making it, though Marino joked that he'd had to slim down before he could fit into his signature pink bow tie.
"Had to work off that neck fat," he said. "Got my neck nice and lean."
Slipping on that outfit was a little more stressful for Chao, a newcomer. She had watched the show, years after its debut, while working a food-service survival job herself. "Party Down" had made her feel less alone. She didn't want to ruin it. "I whispered to myself every day, going onto set, 'Be the least funny, but by as little as possible,"' she said.
Williams expressed similar gratitude and anxiety. "Everyone was so sweet and welcoming from the very beginning," he said. "It never felt like an intimidating environment." And yet, he added, "there was still like this insane fear."
The returning cast faced related, if less acute, worries. They have been in the business long enough to understand how revivals can go wrong. (A few of them had even appeared in revivals that flopped.) But they were reassured by the scripts, written by Enbom and a small staff, which suggested a continuity of character and tone and food-poisoning-induced body horror. There was also the pleasure of being together again -- a little older, a little grayer, but still able to drop a tray on cue.
Will the ratings for this coming season be better? Comfortingly, they can't get much worse. But the cast and creative team are counting on the show's turning enough heads that Starz will greenlight a fourth season. ("You better believe I'm not missing that one," Caplan wrote.)
Though Starr is inclined to cynicism, he sounded only mildly sardonic in discussing this ambition. "I really do hope we're allowed to come back and do it again and keep up this little charade we've got going," he said.
Hansen put it a bit more pragmatically. "In 12 years, people are going to love Season 3."

Louis Vuitton Turns to Pharrell Williams: [Style Desk]

Full text: The rapper and music producer will succeed Virgil Abloh and "lead Louis Vuitton toward a new and very exciting chapter," the brand said in a statement.
The fashion and entertainment industries, which have long been intertwined, converged even further on Tuesday when Louis Vuitton named Pharrell Williams, the American rapper and producer, as its new creative director for men's wear.
The French luxury brand announced on Instagram that it had hired Mr. Williams about 16 months after the sudden death of its previous men's wear designer, Virgil Abloh, in 2021. Mr. Williams, the brand said in a statement, "is a visionary whose creative universes expand from music to art, and to fashion -- establishing himself as a cultural global icon."
Other names floated as successors to Mr. Abloh have included the British designers Grace Wales Bonner and Martine Rose, as well as the American designers Telfar Clemens and Colm Dillane, better known as KidSuper, who last month was announced as Louis Vuitton's first ever men's wear guest designer, a sign many took to mean that he had been tapped to follow Mr. Abloh.
But it was ultimately Mr. Williams, 49, who landed what is considered one of the most high-profile creative director roles in men's fashion. His appointment was the first major move by Louis Vuitton's new chief executive, Pietro Beccari, who joined the brand from Dior last month.
Mr. Williams, who was the first male ambassador for Chanel, has worked off and on with Louis Vuitton since 2004. More recently, he entered into a collaboration with the jeweler Tiffany & Company, which with Louis Vuitton is part of the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH. During the January men's wear shows in Paris, Mr. Williams was seldom without his pair of diamond-studded Tiffany & Company sunglasses, which he also wore to the Grammys. His first collection for Louis Vuitton will be shown in June at Men's Fashion Week in Paris.
"I am glad to welcome Pharrell back home, after our collaborations in 2004 and 2008 for Louis Vuitton, as our new men's artistic director," Mr. Beccari said in the brand's statement on Instagram. "His creative vision beyond fashion will undoubtedly lead Louis Vuitton toward a new and very exciting chapter."
Mr. Williams's return to Louis Vuitton is also a return to men's wear design. Earlier this century, he created influential streetwear brands like Billionaire Boys Club and Ice Cream in partnership with the Japanese designer Nigo (who is now the artistic director at Kenzo, which is also owned by LVMH).
Still, Mr. Williams's appointment to the pinnacle of high-end ready-to-wear underscores an apparent trend among luxury goods makers: to put their futures in the hands of multi-hyphenate celebrities, not designers by profession. Other high-profile entertainers to be embraced by luxury fashion in recent years include Rihanna, whose Fenty clothing line in partnership with LVMH shuttered in 2021, and the troubled rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West, who became a fixture at fashion weeks around the world.
Spectacle is now a given at runway shows: The recent Louis Vuitton men's wear event in Paris, for instance, featured astonishingly expensive sets, a front row studded with stars from the worlds of K-Pop, Hollywood and hip-hop, and a supercharged performance by the Spanish singer Rosalía, who sang from atop a souped-up car.
Louis Vuitton, which was founded in 1854, is the cornerstone of the fortune amassed by LVMH's founder and chief executive Bernard Arnault, who was recently ranked the world's richest person. While men's wear constitutes a relatively modest percentage of overall revenue for the brand, it remains a source of optimism as the fastest growing sector in a luxury goods industry that continues to struggle against headwinds induced by the global pandemic and the loss of markets in both China and Russia.

Full text: The best looks from the Saks, LaQuan Smith and Document Journal after-parties.
New York Fashion Week rolled into town and left behind a sea of empty champagne bottles.
Saks kicked things off on Feb. 8 with a cocktail party a few blocks from its Fifth Avenue flagship, hosted by Emma Roberts at the Jazz Club at the Aman New York. Two nights later, Document Journal and Loewe Perfumes held a throbbing dance party atop the new Virgin Hotel in Manhattan. Guests marveled at the glittery skyline and danced till the early morning under the hypnotic beats of the Carry Nation and Fatherhood.
And LaQuan Smith held a playful after-party at the Moxy LES on Feb. 13 that felt like a celebration of self-expressive fashion. The celebrity-filled crowd included Lil Nas X, Teyana Taylor, Ice Spice and Diplo.
Lil Nas X turned New York Fashion Week into his own private runway, turning up in front rows and after-parties in one bedazzled outfit after the next.
Eric André and Emily Ratajkowski showed up at LaQuan Smith's after-party, a day before going Instagram official on Valentine's Day.
'It's a balaclava I made from rainbow fur, inspired by "Monsters, Inc." I like the character Sulley. He's a monster with a good heart.' -- Ravishin Swiss at Document Journal
Charlie XCX and Big Freedia performed at the Saks party to a smartly dressed crowd nibbling on pizza and caviar bumps.
'The camo jacket was inspired by André Leon Talley's infamous Norma Kamali wrap coat. I wanted to pay homage to one of my inspirations.' -- Armiel Chandler at LaQuan Smith
The Most Dressed features great outfits from up, down and all around town.

‘Party Down’ Is Back. Did You RSVP?

The invitations have been sent, the appetizers plated, the bottles opened. Rows of glasses gleam like baby stars. And somewhere, on the fringes of the celebration, a cater waiter is about to do something very wrong.
This was the template of “Party Down,” a Starz comedy that ran for two 10-episode seasons, debuting in the spring of 2009. Canceled just as critics and niche audiences were beginning to catch on, the show followed the disaffected employees of a mid-tier catering company as they moved from party to party, one per episode, filching booze, seducing guests, snorting coke, flirting with Nazism and accidentally poisoning George Takei.
The original 20 episodes never included a surprise party. But get your streamers and party blowers ready. Because in a surprise to just about everyone — most likely including the folks at Nielsen, who once awarded the show’s finale a 0.0 rating among 18- to 49-year-olds — “Party Down” is back. A six-episode revival will premiere on Starz on Feb. 24, with new episodes arriving weekly.
Martin Starr, a returning cast member, seemed to genuinely marvel at the development.
“This was the only show I’ve worked on where people came to work when they weren’t working,” he said in a group video call. “It’s crazy that we get to come back and do it again.”
“Truth be told,” his co-star Ken Marino said, “the reason I came back to set when I wasn’t working is I was between homes.”
Starr: “I do remember you were finding places to go to the bathroom that maybe didn’t have your name.”
Marino: “I still do. I’m going to the bathroom right now.”
Is this the same “Party Down” that failed to dominate cable television over a dozen years ago? Mostly. The show’s original creators, John Enbom, Dan Etheridge, Rob Thomas and Paul Rudd, remain, as executive producers, and Enbom oversees a small staff of writers. The party-a-week structure also endures, as does the original cast — with the exception, based on the five episodes provided in advance, of Lizzy Caplan.
“All of us, for the entire 13 years since we stopped shooting the show, all we wanted to do is make more ‘Party Down,’” the show’s lead, Adam Scott (“Parks and Recreation,” “Severance”), said in a separate interview last month. “We all would have been there for free.”
But the world has changed in the dozen or so years since the original run was canceled. So have the actors. Unknowns or barely knowns when the show debuted, most have since become household names. (The others? Depends on the household.) And they’ve all seen the current crop of disappointing reboots and reprises. “Party Down” could just be the rare show to get it right, mixing the perfect cocktail of star power, nostalgia, growth and gags.
Then again, the characters never put a lot of muscle into bartending. So here’s a Zen koan for a deeply un-Zen show: Can you throw the same party twice?
Are We Having Fun Yet?
The first run of “Party Down” was both structural marvel and joke spectacular. Each episode was simultaneously a workplace comedy, a hangout comedy and a procedural — a sitcom that never sat down. The celebrations it featured — birthdays, after parties — typically bordered the entertainment industry and nearly all of the cater waiters harbored industry dreams of their own.
Those dreams eluded them, which fueled the philosophical inquiry at the show’s center.
“What we were asking was: How long do you chase the dream?” Thomas, one of the creators, said. “When do you grow up? When do you quit banging your head against the wall?”
The “Party Down” staff are all trying to make it, as actors, screenwriters and comedians. (Marino’s Ron, the manager, has a different dream: a Soup ’R Crackers franchise.) Only Henry (Scott), who has traded beer-commercial celebrity for free-floating despair, has opted out. The actors were trying back then to make it, too. None of the original cast — Caplan, Ryan Hansen, Jane Lynch, Marino, Scott, Starr — were anything like famous when the show began. Acting in a comedy about the entertainment industry’s has-beens, also-rans and never-wills resonated with the cast, sometimes uncomfortably.
“It felt so close to home, this show, because I felt like I could be a caterer the next day easily,” Hansen said.
Scott, who at the time had yet to play a lead, then shared that sense of career tenuousness. The cast felt deeply connected to the show in those first seasons, he said, and protective of it. “We just wanted to do it forever, because it made us feel better,” he said. “It really did.”
The salaries, though small, kept a few of the actors on the sunny side of financial precarity. The camaraderie helped, too. (That camaraderie remains; I had four of the actors together on a video call, and I have never heard grown men exchange so many “Love yous.”) Several actors separately compared the original shoot to summer camp.
That genuine affection altered the show’s tone. Some first season episodes included “edgy” humor — gay jokes, post-racial jokes. (“It’s cringey, yeah,” Starr said.) But the creators quickly realized they didn’t need that edge. The show was sadder than that. Funnier, too. The characters are screw-ups, sure, but the show suggests that everyone is a screw-up, especially after an hour at an open bar. So maybe the best thing is to find common cause as you pass the hors d’oeuvres.
“It’s about people who think that they’re going to find happiness in something out there,” Lynch said. “But what they have right in front of them is really quite sweet.”
Lynch shot the first eight episodes. Then she had to leave for the Fox show “Glee.” Marino hired a stripper for her wrap party. The stripper, Lynch recalled, smelled of french fries. The show went on, with Jennifer Coolidge replacing Lynch for two episodes and Megan Mullally, the only actor who was already well-known, coming in for the final 10.
The creators believed that it would keep going, even though, according to Nielsen, the Season 2 finale attracted only 74,000 viewers. Starz had other plans. Those plans didn’t involve letting the creators take the show elsewhere. “Party Down” languished.
One Decade, Zero Dinners
If the original run argued that it’s healthier to let some dreams die, the creators and the cast could never quite manage that. There were talks, every year or so, of getting the crew back together — for a special, for a movie, for a move to another network. Friends and fans often asked Marino about it.
“I was like, ‘They’re working on it,’” he said. “‘It’s going to happen! Right around the corner!’” It took him eight or nine years to accept that maybe that corner wasn’t coming.
Then in 2019, Starz appointed Jeffrey Hirsch as its new president and chief executive. Thomas reached out to Hirsch and began pitching the show again. Hard. This time, Starz said yes.
That was only the first hurdle. The actors had conflicts and prior commitments now. The revival was approved in the summer of 2021, with production scheduled for early 2022. Lynch was to begin rehearsing a Broadway musical. Scott was making the Apple TV+ show “Severance.” Mullally had booked a movie being shot in Idaho.
Somehow a six-week window was found, even though that window involved flying Mullally to Los Angeles every weekend and back to Sun Valley by Monday.
“We could never get together for dinner for a decade,” Etheridge, a creator, said. “But when we came to shoot the show, everybody was there.”
Everybody except for Caplan, who had signed onto the FX series “Fleishman Is in Trouble.” (Asked whether Caplan might make a surprise appearance in Episode 6, Starz declined to comment.) Enbom had originally structured this new season around the on-again-off-again relationship between Henry and Caplan’s Casey. He had to restructure it, adding a new character, a studio executive played by Jennifer Garner. The revival’s first episode takes time out to heckle Caplan: Casey, now a successful comedian, can’t make a crew reunion.
“She’s shooting in New York,” Starr’s Roman, still an aspiring “hard sci-fi” writer, says. “Too big time for the likes of us.”
There were fewer jokes in real life. Hansen tried to make light of the situation. “Listen, we get it,” he said. “She had a job, whatever. I mean, I personally turned down a Marvel movie to do ‘Party Down.’”
“Tell that to everybody,” he added.
But just about everyone described themselves as heartbroken, including Caplan. “If I think about it for too long, I start to cry,” she wrote in an email. She sent cupcakes to the shoot.
The Bow Tie Abides
Hollywood has transformed in the years since “Party Down” first concluded, and in some ways the show has, too. Gratuitous boobs are gone now. And the catering crew, once blindingly white, has become more diverse with the inclusion of two new regulars: Sackson, a YouTube-style content creator played by Tyrel Jackson Williams, and Lucy, a chef played by Zoë Chao who styles herself as a “food artist.”
Yet, the sweet-sour, slightly funky flavor of “Party Down” — like a margarita made with off-brand liquor — is mostly unaltered. This seems to be the rare revival that understands what made the original work, yet can still move (or move just enough to include the occasional TikTok dance challenge) with the times.
“We kept doing what we’d always been doing, just with new details,” Enbom said. “Because society certainly has not changed into a more wholesome place.”
Have the returning characters changed? That depends on how much you and your therapist believe that change is possible. “They’re still the same lovable knuckleheads,” Mullally said. “Most of these people haven’t really moved on, or they haven’t really become any happier, or more fulfilled in their lives.”
Slinging hors d’oeuvres hits different and more darkly in midlife. Still, the creators and the cast didn’t want the revival to feel like a bummer.
“It’s going to be fun watching the characters try to claw their way toward something other than their current circumstances,” Scott promised.
And if not exactly “fun,” then certainly relatable. “Really who gets what they want in this life?” Lynch said.
She probably meant that rhetorically. But the “Party Down” die-hards, Lynch included, did get what they wanted, a third season. And they seem to have delighted in making it, though Marino joked that he’d had to slim down before he could fit into his signature pink bow tie.

She had watched the show, years after its debut, while working a food-service survival job herself. “Party Down” had made her feel less alone. She didn’t want to ruin it. “I whispered to myself every day, going onto set, ‘Be the least funny, but by as little as possible,’” she said.
Williams expressed similar gratitude and anxiety. “Everyone was so sweet and welcoming from the very beginning,” he said. “It never felt like an intimidating environment.” And yet, he added, “there was still like this insane fear.”
The returning cast faced related, if less acute, worries. They have been in the business long enough to understand how revivals can go wrong.

But they were reassured by the scripts, written by Enbom and a small staff, which suggested a continuity of character and tone and food-poisoning-induced body horror. There was also the pleasure of being together again — a little older, a little grayer, but still able to drop a tray on cue.
Will the ratings for this coming season be better? Comfortingly, they can’t get much worse. But the cast and creative team are counting on the show’s turning enough heads that Starz will greenlight a fourth season. (“You better believe I’m not missing that one,” Caplan wrote.)
Though Starr is inclined to cynicism, he sounded only mildly sardonic in discussing this ambition. “I really do hope we’re allowed to come back and do it again and keep up this little charade we’ve got going,” he said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: There is perhaps no Zoom meeting less satisfying than one scheduled on a cold weekday morning to talk about food -- specifically, the food that one ought to eat in Paris. We couldn't gather in a great restaurant, for the people assembled were chefs and writers spread across continents, some racing from their kitchens, others dialing in after dropping off their children. The frenetic life we'd all once known was, in many senses, back. And so was the Paris culinary scene, driven by that thrilling hunt for places both new and old, French and not, an obsession among natives and tourists alike.
As with a similar list we made for New York -- and as part of our ongoing T 25 series, which has surfaced significant and memorable travel destinations, buildings, interiors, art, fashion and books -- we wanted to name the essential Parisian dishes to eat right now. With both visitors and residents in mind, I'd assembled a panel of experts who either work in the city, are from there or spend lots of time in town, including the pastry chef Dominique Ansel; the cookbook author Dorie Greenspan; Moko Hirayama and Omar Koreitem, the couple who run the restaurants Mokonuts and Mokoloco in the 11th Arrondissement; and Marie-Aude Rose, the French chef of New York's La Mercerie (who is also, as might be expected, involved in several businesses throughout America and France overseen by her husband, the chef Daniel Rose). I'd asked each of them to nominate 10 or so candidates ahead of time, which ranged from entire meals at gastronomic temples to pastries and street-food staples they'd happened upon on their blocks; the goal was to include classically rich options as well as newer, more internationally inflected choices. And nothing could be nominated from any of our panelists' establishments (although there would have been many worthy contenders).
Surprisingly, or perhaps not, no one chose a baguette or a croissant. On these longer lists, there were just two overlaps: ice cream by Jessica Yang, a rising chef who co-owns a cave à vin called Folderol, and Ispahan macarons by Pierre Hermé, the grand-père of contemporary French desserts. We quickly advanced those -- and some other sweets -- to the next round, then spent hours that day, and in a few follow-up calls, discussing everything else we felt merited inclusion: bistro fare, as well as its 21st-century permutations; genteel seafood; haute patisserie; European favorites, particularly from Italy, that have recently crossed borders; and other items influenced and made by the immigrants from Africa, Asia and the Middle East who make Paris what it is today.
The final list, which appears in unranked alphabetical order below and covers most arrondissements, isn't what we expected, nor is it like the myriad Parisian food rankings we've all encountered before. There's nothing from impossible to reserve (and impossibly expensive) prix fixe stalwarts, but there is the best fried chicken you'll find outside of the Philippines. Naturally, a few popular wine bars and bistronomy spots made the cut, although mostly for modernizing things like chou farci and steak au poivre. But this list, like all lists, is subjective: It reflects the palates and sensibilities of our panelists on a few gray January mornings. Above all, it speaks to the fact that great food -- particularly in Paris, particularly right now -- looks forward and backward at once: That's what makes eating there (and debating where to eat there) so deliciously freewheeling. -- Kurt Soller
This conversation has been edited and condensed.
1. The Cassoulet at L'Assiette
Situated on a quiet street below Montparnasse is the chef David Rathgeber's L'Assiette, a gilded example of fine French bistro fare. The brief menu includes market-driven specialties like escargot and pâté, but it would be a mistake not to order the cassoulet, the slow-simmering, stick-to-your-ribs stew served in generous portions in the wide-lipped cauldron, the cassole d'Issel, that gives the Languedocian dish its name. While it's considered rustic as French cuisine goes -- and is rarely found on bistro menus these days -- Rathgeber's version honors each individual ingredient: thin-skinned white mogette beans from the Vendée region; the harmoniously meaty trio of duck confit, succulent pork belly and a hunk of lamb's neck that melts from the bone; and garlic sausage on top. It's made twice weekly, giving the beans and broth time to mingle and deepen their flavor. -- Katherine McGrath
181 Rue du Château, 14th Arrondissement.
Dominique Ansel: I love cassoulet. I cook one every year for my team around Christmas, but Chef Rathgeber makes one of the best. He cooks simple bistro food, but the quality is impeccable. It's not pretentious.
2. The Chocolates at Patrick Roger
Patrick Roger calls himself a "chocolatier-sculpteur," and the fantastical forms that fill his shop windows -- life-size animals and expressive abstract volumes, some carved from enormous blocks of chocolate -- have become fixtures in the wealthy neighborhoods where his seven boutiques are found. Inside, however, it's the miniatures that get all the attention: Refined squares of chocolate, filled with ganache, praline or marzipan, fan out in boxes beneath the glass counters like fine jewelry. Many Parisians are devoted to the distinctive citrus-accented ones, such as the potent lime-basil Delhi or the lime-caramel Amazone, with its glossy, painterly demisphere. But it's best to try a few together, comparing Roger's mellower flavors (oat or beer ganache) with some of his more mischievous (often limited-edition) combinations, such as potato vodka almond paste or cannabis coffee. The assorted take-home sets range from small metal cases with a concise sampling to extravagant emerald green boxes containing more than 600 grams of chocolate, about as much as Roger himself claims to eat daily. -- Zoey Poll
Multiple locations .
Dorie Greenspan: As Dominique wrote [on his list of nominations], you bite into them and you immediately know what flavor they are.
Ansel: I'd describe him first as an artist, not as a pastry chef. My wife always tells me I have a man crush on him. Of course, there are lots of places in Paris that have good chocolate bonbons, but he took it very far and that's tricky -- it's like chemistry.
3. The Chou Farci at Parcelles
Its anise-and-clove-flavored veal broth resembles a Yayoi Kusama painting with all those oil bubbles, while the stuffed savoy cabbage it surrounds looks like a gift to be unwrapped. Once you cut it open, you may be thrilled to find pistachio chips and warm foie gras mixed in with the minced pork, adding sophistication to an otherwise homey classic that was historically developed from leftovers. The 32-seat wine bar is tucked among boutiques and art galleries in the Upper Marais and doesn't look like much from the outside; come wintertime, curtains cover half the windows, with little to entice passers-by except the daily menu taped outside. Those resourceful enough to know you need a reservation will find an in-demand neighborhood restaurant with exposed stone walls and a copper-topped bar dating to 1936. Its three young proprietors, the couple Bastien Fidelin and Sarah Michielsen, and their friend the chef Julien Chevallier, bought the place in 2021 after years spent in the world of fine dining, and they've become increasingly creative with each passing month; as Fidelin says, "The bistro is liberté." -- Sara Lieberman
13 Rue Chapon, Third Arrondissement.
Marie-Aude Rose: I was surprised by Parcelles -- I had the lièvre à la Royale [hare with red-wine garlic sauce], which was something I was doing when I [was employed] at Guy Savoy: It's a lot of work. It's impressive they're doing [those kinds of traditional] dishes so well.
Greenspan: I thought the food was just beautiful.
Rose: I'm not so much into the natural wine, but the food: yes.
4. The Dinner Menu at Le Baratin
You don't just stumble upon the chef Raquel Carena's bistro, which she's been running with her partner, Philippe Pinoteau, for the past three decades -- it's up in the 20th Arrondissement, off the main artery of one of Paris's Chinatowns, Rue de Belleville. But chefs themselves, along with French gourmands who crave offal, have been making the trek for years -- and curious tourists followed after Anthony Bourdain visited it in 2012 for an episode of "The Layover." Devoid of music, the brightly lit space is decorated with little beyond a wall of cooking and art books. In the kitchen, Carena relies upon lesser-known ingredients and techniques; even those with a working knowledge of French may be unfamiliar with menu terms like "estouffade de joue de boeuf" (smothered beef cheek) and "barbajuan" (a sort of fried ravioli from the south of France). Carena's plating is usually uncomplicated, as in a chickpea crepe with ricotta and tomato ragout that's folded like an omelet rather than a traditional galette, or a nut cheese ice cream that comes partially melted, almost like a sweet soup. You may have to confirm your own reservation day of -- and note that they're taken only by phone. -- S.L.
3 Rue Jouye-Rouve, 20th Arrondissement.
Ansel: This is my favorite restaurant. It's almost like home cooking, with these old-school dishes you can't find anywhere else -- I get the veal brains [pictured above, at top right]. It's about the simplicity and, more so, the quality of the ingredients: You really have to get them in France.
Rose: Raquel always has these Utah Beach oysters [also pictured above], with just a touch of Japanese vinegar -- they're amazing.
5. The Endive and Blue Goat Cheese Scamorza Pizza at Pizzamarole/Le Rigmarole
Since opening the tasting menu-focused Le Rigmarole in 2017, the married 30-something chefs Robert Compagnon and Jessica Yang -- he's French American and she's Taiwanese American; they met while working at Guy Savoy -- have consistently upended the city's contemporary dining scene. It started with their eclectic omakase-style debut, blending binchotan-grilled dishes, fresh pastas and homemade ice cream, all paired with natural and biodynamic wines. Folderol followed next door (see No. 10) and, last fall, the duo went in another unexpected direction, opening a pizza pop-up led by the sourdough expert Dan Pearson. The couple asked the American baker, who had previously worked at Ten Belles in Paris and Panic bakery in Madrid, to take over their space while they adjusted to life with a second child. Pizza may seem like a departure from Compagnon and Yang's cooking, but the philosophy has remained the same: Stay simple and seasonal, but push flavor to its maximum. In fact, the endive, bleu de chèvre and scamorza pizza, a heady standout on the winter menu, isn't far from a grilled endive dish that Compagnon once served. May it follow Pearson wherever he goes next. -- Lindsey Tramuta
10 Rue du Grand Prieuré, 11th Arrondissement.
Omar Koreitem: Moko and I are 10 years older than Robert and Jess, but we always say that we look up to them.
Greenspan: They're so serious. I mean, they're also lovely and funny, but they think about everything and test and test and test, and it shows in the food. I don't think there's another restaurant like Le Rigmarole in Paris: It's so personal and idiosyncratic.
Koreitem: He's going to be [making pizza] through the end of February, and then Le Rigmarole is going to come back. Dan really made [pizza] his own.
Greenspan: The endive with the blue goat cheese! He works so hard on the dough: One day, he uses five flours; one day, he uses six. But the [toppings are] like if you went to a restaurant and ordered a [plated] dish. He's thought about it like a cook.
6. The Fried Chicken at Reyna
Maybe you don't go to Paris to eat wings, but that might change after trying the chef Erica Paredes's twice-fried chicken, which comes topped with one of three sauces: adobo, a balsamic, sugar and soy glaze topped with garlic yogurt (not much heat); the Patis Caramel, made from fish sauce (lip-tingling heat); and the Pinatubo, a spicy mango habanero option with chile oil and bird's-eye chiles (full-mouth fire). At Paredes's 33-seat restaurant, with its concrete walls and pink-and-gold accents, the wings come in either three- or five-piece portions and you're instructed to eat with your hands. Paredes, who studied at Le Cordon Bleu and has been cooking in Paris for seven years -- both for chefs like Joël Robuchon and at private homes -- has taken the techniques she learned at school and infused them with the Filipino ingredients she knew from her upbringing in Manila. "The more I put myself into the food," she says, "the more people liked it and the happier I was to cook." -- S.L.
41 Rue de Montreuil, 11th Arrondissement.
Moko Hirayama: Ethnic food in Paris is very, very lame. The spiciness is tamed. It's adapted to cater to the French palate. But Erica sticks to her Filipino thing -- she doesn't care if she uses ketchup or canned [items] or some special vinegar: That's the flavor.
Koreitem: It cannot be more fried than it is; it cannot be more chickeny than it is. ...
Greenspan: And there's a hot sauce with it. ... And the place is just so cute ... and the menu is fun.
Koreitem: She was selling fried chicken from home during the pandemic, and I think that was a really big hit. Even before she had a restaurant, she was gaining a following for it on Instagram.
7. The Fruit Tarts at Des Gâteaux et Du Pain
At Claire Damon's two boutiques, sculptural creations gleam in the display case. The desserts are elegant in form and often crafted around each season's bounty of fresh fruit -- the chef grew up on an orchard in Auvergne -- which she uses only at their peak. As such, the selections change every few weeks: poached pear tarts in autumn (pictured above), say, or peach and cherry ones in summer. Her modern approach is similar to that of a perfumer in that she arranges notes in layers; winter's Absolu Citron is creamy and tangy, featuring olive oil-infused meringue beneath a lemony custard, with a swipe of concentrated Corsican lemon gel on top. Damon is well on her way to building an empire like that of her mentor, Pierre Hermé (see No. 11), but she considers herself, first and foremost, a pastry chef. -- K.M.
63 Boulevard Pasteur, 15th Arrondissement; 89 Rue du Bac, Seventh Arrondissement.
Greenspan: Her flavors are clear and delicate. Everything looks refined and elegant. Whatever fruit tart she does in season is worth getting.
Koreitem: The viennoiserie, too.
8. The Fruttini at Fruttini by Mo
At first glance, the offerings at this frilly haute glacerie with pale pink banquettes and tropical motifs appear incongruously austere: two pristine lemon halves; a single neon green lime, served with a spoon in a dainty metal coupelle. Concealed inside the rind, however, is a scoop of bright sorbet. These are fruits givrés, an elevated take on a retro summertime treat that was first popularized in southern Italy; the owners, Marie-Laure Pollet and Ollivia Berdah, who opened the salon in 2018, were inspired by the sorbet-stuffed citrus fruits of their childhood, a 1980s supermarket freezer-aisle favorite. Here, the three dozen or so chilled fruits on the menu are all natural, the sorbet made from fresh pulp or flesh blended with mineral water and organic cane sugar. Crowd pleasers include passion fruit and verbena-infused lemon, plus grand centerpieces, like the cacao pod with a dinner party's worth of dark chocolate-and-cacao nib sorbet inside, and seasonal specials, such as late summer's wild peaches or winter's clementines, an effective 9 euro antidote to Parisian grisaille. -- Z.P.
24 Rue Saint-Placide, Sixth Arrondissement.
Rose: I had this for New Year's Eve and it was just amazing sorbet. And these kinds of fruits givrés are [always] pretty and refreshing after a meal.
9. The Glazed Madeleines at Ritz Paris Le Comptoir
"Those short, plump little cakes called 'petites madeleines,' which look as though they had been molded in the fluted scallop of a pilgrim's shell," Marcel Proust famously wrote in "In Search of Lost Time" (1913), turning the French confection into a stand-in for the pleasures of memory. For François Perret, the head pastry chef of the Ritz Paris since 2015, it was inconceivable not to summon Proust when he began developing the hotel's afternoon tea, hosted in a salon that bears the author's name. Once Perret settled on the format, full of traditions from his childhood in eastern France like petits fours and chocolate-covered biscuits, the madeleine emerged as an obvious focal point -- and then became the emblem of Le Comptoir, the hotel's pastry shop, which opened in 2021. "The madeleine is beautiful, luscious and wonderfully nostalgic. But most important, it's versatile," he says. With a shape that takes more inspiration from the fleur-de-lis than the usual seashell, his glazed madeleines come in seven permanent flavors, including caramel, chocolate, raspberry and passion fruit, and then get tweaked further for special occasions (speculoos in December, white chocolate coconut for Easter). Each is generously filled with candied or puréed fruit, silky caramel or dark chocolate ganache, which helps them stay unexpectedly supple and lends surprising heft. As Perret says, "They're pure, regressive indulgence." -- L.T.
38 Rue Cambon, First Arrondissement.
Greenspan: The Ritz is the Ritz; the pastry shop you can just breeze into when you've come from the gym. They're really creative -- a lovely reading of madeleines: filled in the center and glazed. François is very playful. What he does is whimsical and has real flavor. He thinks like a child in terms of pastry, but his skill and craftsmanship are incredible.
10. The Ice Cream at Folderol
Ice cream and wine are unlikely bedfellows, but the two come together harmoniously at Folderol, Compagnon and Yang's cave à vin, which is next door to Le Rigmarole (see No. 5). The couple took a gamble on the pairing when they opened at the end of 2020 -- not only because of pandemic-related restrictions (service was initially to-go only) but also because of a local culture that rarely succumbs to the joy of a few scoops of ice cream after a long day. And yet their selection of small-batch, hard-packed ice creams and sorbets -- which might include cold brew (using beans from Fjord in Germany, known for its light, balanced roast) or sesame brownie or banana crème crue, depending on the week -- swiftly conquered any doubts. Two years on, an intergenerational group of regulars spill onto the street, many enjoying generous portions of olive oil ice cream, a signature flavor. Sourced from a family-run purveyor in Tuscany, the oil is balanced and fruity, with a rich, almost creamy texture. "My family has been going to the same place since I was a kid, so I know the producer well," says Compagnon. "It's perfect for seasoning and finishing, and perfect for ice cream." -- L.T.
10 Rue du Grand Prieuré, 11th Arrondissement.
Hirayama: There's good old American ice cream, and there is the kind of ice cream you find at fancy restaurants, no matter where you are [in the world]. Neither is perfect: too sweet or, at the Michelin places, lacking in flavor. Jess's is the [right] in-between.
Greenspan: Ice cream is interesting. There's a boom going on in Paris right now. Here, the flavors are always true: That's what coffee tastes like, that's what olive oil tastes like. It's hard to make good ice cream because cold reduces flavor. Plus the place is fun.
11. The Ispahan Macaron at Pierre Hermé
Pierre Hermé, France's best-known pastry chef, first learned to make macarons as a teenage apprentice in the 1970s at Lenôtre, then the country's pre-eminent temple of patisserie. But it wasn't until he took over the pastry operation at Fauchon in the 1980s that he made a name for himself by reinventing classic recipes and playing with unconventional flavors, like rose, which he discovered via Bulgarian cooking back when the flower didn't yet have a role in French confections. Finding novel ways to use it became an obsession, one that followed him to Ladurée, where he overhauled the business and established the macaron as the ultimate expression of Parisian taste before launching his namesake empire in 2001. The Ispahan, his flavor creation that appears in a collection of desserts, including his trademark bite-size macarons, is the result of years of experimentation: The filling of floral rose and sweet lychee cream is offset by the bright acidity of raspberry jelly, all combined within a rose-flavored shell that's yielding yet crunchy. Hermé has since become known for other iconic flavors -- such as the Mogador, blending milk chocolate and passion fruit -- but none has inspired as many imitators as the Ispahan. -- L.T.
Multiple locations .
Ansel: The first time I had Ispahan was when Pierre opened his shop in the early 2000s. The combination of those three flavors -- it stops you and makes you think because of the contrast of flavors and textures in your mouth.
Greenspan: Full disclosure: I worked with Pierre on two cookbooks. But that basic combination of rose, lychee and raspberry was new -- and it's got to be good if a million other places are doing it now. It's so easy to forget people who really made changes in food because we've [become] so used to them.
Ansel: Dishes like this, which you remember for the rest of your life -- you don't get that many. For me, that Ispahan flavor: It's Paris.
12. The John Dory With Vodka Butter at Le Duc
This mainstay has been serving scallops crudo and salmon tartare, the latter of which it claims to have invented, to dignitaries and celebrities since 1967. Former patrons include President François Mitterrand, who went there weekly, and the Yves Saint Laurent co-founder and C.E.O. Pierre Bergé. Today, this Left Bank institution is run by Dominique Minchelli, the 57-year-old son of the founder, Jean Minchelli. The seafaring theme starts outside with the building's "Love Boat"-esque facade and porthole door, with a seafood-only menu that includes wild fish caught from small boats in the local Atlantic waters. Generous starters include paper-thin sliced sea bass carpaccio meant to be eaten on garlic and thyme toast, and one "essential" main, as the menu calls it, is the John Dory fish smothered in a vodka and butter sauce. It's offered "rosé à l'arête," or cooked for one minute under the grill, then finished in hot Beillevaire butter from Charente-Maritime, and served alongside a scoop of Italian black rice. The eight or so diminutive cutlets are plated to look like a flower. -- S.L.
243 Boulevard Raspail, 14th Arrondissement.
Rose: It's really expensive, but a beautiful place, and the fish is ... wow. From the carpaccio of sea bass to the scallops au naturel to the lobster spaghetti: For good fish, you've got to pay the price, [and] Le Duc's the place to go.
13. The Lahmacun at Le Paradis
Lahmacun can be many things -- a starter, a late-night snack or a to-go sidewalk lunch. At Le Paradis, a Kurdish eatery in the 11th, the wisp-thin homemade flatbread is covered with a peppery blend of freshly ground beef and lamb, minced veggies, herbs and spices. It comes with fresh shredded lettuce, onions, cucumbers and tomatoes, which are meant to be rolled up inside, like a charred, crispy wrap, then doused in lemon juice. Like everything else on the laminated menu at this takeout counter, it's made to order, hot and fresh. Customers linger, transfixed and impatient, as the Kurdish cook Cennet Bayhan moves around her tiny kitchen, sliding disks of homemade dough in and out of the narrow electric-oven slots, flipping meat skewers on the smoky grill and pulling handfuls of potatoes from giant yogurt containers. For many years, Bayhan could be found in the same spot, dispensing French crepes. After being forced to close in 2017 because of a leak, she decided to reopen with classic street-food recipes collected from her relatives in Turkey, where she grew up. -- Z.P.
239 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine, 11th Arrondissement.
Hirayama: One of our staff members had a passion for lahmacun: He would go all over town, and he found this one that happened to be near where Omar and I live. He was like, "You have to try it," and it was so true. We just love the story, the lady, the fact of its existence.
Koreitem: She makes them one by one -- when you order three, you wait 20 minutes. But it's worth it. I wish more people knew about her: I don't want it to close!
14. The Normandy Scallops at Café des Ministères
At this pristine bistro on a calm square in the Seventh Arrondissement steps away from the Palais Bourbon, the chef Jean Sévègnes renders exquisite dishes with an unpretentious and light touch. Arrive at the beginning of the lunch or dinner service and he'll likely take your order himself before retreating to the kitchen, where he works alone, creating quintessential French starters: duck foie gras with Menton lemon chutney; a distinguished oeuf mayo; boudin noir served cold and fresh, typical of the southwest, where Sévègnes is from. If it's in season, just order the coquilles Saint Jacques, which taste as delicate and precious as they look. Along the grooves of the fan-shaped shells, there's buttery pomme duchesse piped into crisp, frilly peaks, encircling the nutty, tender scallops, fresh from Dieppe, Normandy, which sit above a silky mushroom and scallop beard fumet and are tinged with poppy red Espelette pepper. Roxane Sévègnes, the chef's wife and co-owner of the restaurant, presides over the front of house and tends to each of the dozen or so tables with unfussy generosity. If you become a regular, she may even set your place with a wooden napkin ring inscribed with your first name and initial. -- Z.P.
83 Rue de l'Université, Seventh Arrondissement.
Rose: I want to honor the work of Chef Sévègnes: He makes those supertraditional bourgeois dishes so well.
Greenspan: The last time I was at Bistrot Paul Bert [see No. 22], which was in December, Bertrand [the owner] said to me, "Have you been to Café des Ministères? You must go!" I couldn't get a table.
Koreitem: It's important to mention places like this because that's one thing we're really missing in Paris: classic food. That's what I crave; that's what I want to eat.
Greenspan: Paris is changing -- the diversity, the new cuisines, different kinds of food. But it's true, [it's become] hard to find traditional, good French food, [even if] that's still what people want.
15. The Palmier at Carette
Tourists love the city's ornate tea salons, but Carette, which first opened in the 1920s on the Place du Trocadéro, is where the locals go. The original one (there are now three), redecorated by Hubert de Givenchy 20 years ago, is dressed in pink salmon marble, brass accents, chocolate velvet curtains and Art Deco chandeliers. The room is lively, with neighbors taking their morning coffee or collecting their viennoiserie, mesdames lingering over brunch and children eyeing decadent desserts like the Paris-Carette (the maison's version of a Paris-Brest). The molten hot chocolate, dark and unctuous, is served in an antique floral porcelain set alongside Chantilly cream. And the oversize palmier, with its browned butter and caramelized edges, is undeniably the city's best -- perfectly flaky and sticky to the touch, made like this since 1927. In the back corner, a portrait of Madame Carette watches over the room, as if to ensure that no detail's overlooked. -- K.M.
Multiple locations .
Greenspan: A friend of mine [recently] chose Carette for lunch -- it's very, you know, tea salony. But that palmier -- Omar, it looks almost like your [headphones]. It was huge, and thicker than I normally would expect a palmier to be, and it was baked all the way through, which can be [difficult] when you have something with that many layers, and yet it stayed crisp.
16. The Pithivier at Maison Sota
A pithivier is an arcane 18th-century French dish that purportedly originated in a town of the same name, near Orleans, where bakers would enclose almond cream between two layers of decadent puff pastry to create sweet shareable pies. But it's the Tokyo-born chef Sota Atsumi who's become pithivier's truest disciple: Last decade, when he ran the kitchen at Clown Bar -- a kooky, forward-thinking bistro founded in 1907, so named because it's two doors down from the baroque Cirque d'Hiver Bouglione, where the circus still performs -- many diners would sit down and immediately ask for his savory individual-size meat pies, which took 30 minutes to cook. Three years ago, Atsumi and his wife, Akiko Atsumi, opened their own restaurant, Maison Sota, inside a terra-cotta-tiled, gabled-roof building that looks, as the name suggests, like it could be the couple's own home. For both lunch and dinner, the chef creates experimental tasting menus that draw from Sota's Japanese heritage as much as from the farmers upon whom he relies. If you're lucky, there might be pithivier (like duck, pictured above) on the menu; if not, you'll still eat very well. -- K.S.
3 Rue Saint-Hubert, 11th Arrondissement.
Koreitem: There are to this day two meals I've had in Paris that I will never forget. One was at L'Arpège in 2005, and Moko and I promised that we would never go back so we could keep that memory untarnished. The second was [from] Sota when he worked at Clown Bar. The pithivier, which blew my mind, was Dover sole and foie gras, cooked inside puff pastry. I spoke to Sota about this pithivier many years later, and he told me, "Oh, I just did [that combination] once."
Greenspan: He [has done] it with pigeon, and it's phenomenal.
Koreitem: And he still does it [at Maison Sota], especially during game season. But Sota's food doesn't stop at pithivier -- he's my favorite chef in Paris.
17. The Sausage and Mashed Potatoes at Les Arlots
Repartir en roulant -- that's what happens after a meal at this 30-seat bistro near the Gare du Nord: Leave by rolling home. While the pan-fried housemade sausage, a blend of pork shoulder and rib fat flavored with fennel and rosemary, stands out among the menu's many hearty dishes, the mashed potatoes it sits upon are hardly an afterthought, nor is the sweet, tangy jus poured on top. Similar in texture to Jöel Robuchon's famous potato purée -- thanks to the 500 grams of Charentes-Poitou butter that the chef, Thomas Brachet, uses per kilo of skin-on, boiled-then-hand-ground Agata and Pompadour spuds -- the dish is best enjoyed with one of the natural wines displayed along the back wall. According to Brachet, who's owned the restaurant since 2016, the goal is for diners "to meet someone, be positive, maybe get a little drunk." -- S.L.
136 Rue du Faubourg Poissonnière, 10th Arrondissement.
Hirayama: The chef is younger, and he's [adding] delight to all these classic dishes. It's literally pork sausage and potato purée: You eat them together and you're in heaven.
Koreitem: It's actually a piece of art.
18. The Seigle Feuilleté at Les Copains du Faubourg
The mill on a ledge above the bakers' counter is impossible to miss; indeed, its steady grind of rare, artisanal flours -- and the metronomic clack-clack it produces -- often lulls customers into a moment of morning contemplation. As hypnotic as it is functional, the flour production at Les Copains du Faubourg speaks to the b­aker Gérald Auvrez's ambition to bring hyperlocality to baking. Since taking over the storefront a half-decade ago, he's begun sourcing wheat from several different regional farms, with, he says, "the idea to make our bread as winemakers make wine -- to present a terroir." The crusty, pointed baguettes and cinnamon-laden chaussons aux pommes exemplify this mission, but it's the more experimental seigle feuilleté -- a puffy pastry that tastes (and looks) like a mix between a croissant and a small loaf of bread, made from a half-wheat, half-rye blend -- that's truly unexpected. -- K.M.
237 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine, 11th Arrondissement.
Hirayama: When I first came to Paris [13 years ago], I felt every bakery was great ... but it turns out most places are not good or bad. Since then, I've become very skeptical. But this guy took over [our] neighborhood bakery, and he doesn't want it to be just a regular boulangerie; he wants to go from grain to end product. The seigle feuilleté is something he developed in New York, when he was working with Dan Barber at Blue Hill at Stone Barns.
Koreitem: He's sort of the new kid on the block. He mills his own flour, which is quite surprising. His croissant is one of the best I've had. But the seigle feuilleté is unique [because] of the rye.
19. The Shiro Wat at Le Négus
At Le Négus, the shiro wat -- a traditional Ethiopian chickpea stew -- starts not in the kitchen but rather at the baggage claim at Charles de Gaulle airport, where the restaurant's owner, Sisay Mehabie, regularly collects suitcases packed with shiro powder made by his mother-in-law in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The vivid orange mix of sun-dried chickpeas, garlic, roux, holy basil and smoky, sweet brown chile is then transformed by Mehabie's wife, Sitina Mehabie, into a velvety, clarified butter-enriched soup, redolent with earthy flavor and heat. As an accompaniment to the kaleidoscopic sharing platters that fill each table, the shiro wat comes in a steaming cast-iron pot alongside extra injera, the satisfyingly sour, spongy flatbread, folded and stacked like linen napkins. With its walls covered in goatskin paintings, Amharic alphabet charts, family photos and depictions of events in French Ethiopian diplomatic history, Le Négus looks like a colorful classroom. Mehabie, the self-appointed teacher, takes this role seriously, initiating dinner with the gursha, a traditional act of hospitality that involves feeding each guest a bite of their meal. A final ceremony concludes the night: Coffee -- fruity, rich and aromatic -- is poured out at the table from a long-necked clay brewing pot in a cloud of frankincense and myrrh. -- Z.P.
52 Rue de Montreuil, 11th Arrondissement.
Hirayama: I didn't want to put it on the list -- I want to keep the best secrets for just me and my friends. It's run by a couple, and they've been here for a long time. The chef is so proud of his culture, and he's really trying to convey it. So it's a whole experience, beyond the fact that it's delicious. You can't move once you sit -- and they don't offer a lot of wine choices, but they have good beer -- and you feel the warmth.
Koreitem: Whenever we have a craving for something good and comforting, this is where we eat. On your next trip to Paris, I encourage you to go. Every person I've told about this place has become obsessed with it -- including Robert from Le Rigmarole.
20. The Smoked Goose Ravioli at Tan Dinh
After a visit to Hanoi, Vietnam, for the 1902 World's Fair, the mononymous food critic Curnonsky, known as France's Prince of Gastronomy, wrote that if Asian cuisine were paired with French wine, it would be the best combination in the world, a declaration that the Vietnamese chef Robert Vifian, now in his 70s, has taken as creed. At Tan Dinh, an unassuming spot on a side street behind the Musée d'Orsay, Vifian and his brother, Freddy, serve 20 or so Vietnamese dishes, many of which are riffs on traditional and family recipes. They're all meant to be paired with wines from their deep cellar, which is especially rich in rare vintages of Bordeaux and Bourgogne (be sure to ask for the chef's wine list). Dishes like the smoked goose ravioli -- which are more like dumplings stuffed with wood ear mushrooms, fowl and diced onion, akin to Vietnamese bánh cuốn -- haven't changed since the late 1970s, when the siblings took over the restaurant from their mother. -- K.M.
60 Rue de Verneuil, Seventh Arrondissement.
Rose: It's been there for 45 years, I think. The brothers are still [running it]. The interesting thing is that they have the most amazing wine list but they don't give it to you unless you specifically ask. When they were young, they told me, their parents bought them an apartment, but the brothers sold it so they could buy wine. And those dumplings: so fresh and delicious.
21. The Sole Meunière at Bofinger
Claiming nearly the entire side of a small street just off the historic Place de la Bastille, this bilevel brasserie with Alsatian roots dates back to 1864. Once you step through the wooden revolving door, you're transported to a bygone era where servers wear ties and carry metal trays on their shoulders as they bring out cumin-flecked sauerkraut and towering platters of fruits de mer. The cuisine is classic and the atmosphere somewhat kitschy, complete with the sound of clanging silverware and giant, wedding-worthy floral arrangements throughout the Art Nouveau space. Reserve ahead for a table under the domed stained-glass atrium, although the other cozy rooms across both floors all feature similar setups, with leather banquettes, wooden bistro chairs and white tablecloths. At 46 euros, the sole meunière, accompanied by the city's creamiest whipped potatoes, is great to share between two people. First the fish is brought out whole for inspection, then it's carefully filleted back in the kitchen before being plated with parsley and lemon wedges. It's ideal for a date, particularly when followed by profiteroles for dessert. -- S.L.
5-7 Rue de la Bastille, Fourth Arrondissement.
Greenspan: It's a dish I adore; my husband orders it without fail at Paul Bert [see No. 22].
Koreitem: The reason I have Bofinger on the list is not the sole meunière alone but the experience of going there, which is special. We've made a tradition of taking our two girls there for Christmas -- they can order whatever they want.
22. The Steak au Poivre at Bistrot Paul Bert
Even in the contemporary dining paradise that is the 11th Arrondissement, it's impossible to deny the appeal of an old-school French bistro. Bistrot Paul Bert has long been adored by locals and discerning tourists, who compete for seats in its three bustling dining areas. (If you can't get in, the owner, Bertrand Auboyneau, who's run it with his wife, Gwenaëlle, since 1997, also has a seafood outpost, a wine bar and another restaurant on the same street.) Carnivore-friendly standards include foie gras, beef carpaccio, roast pigeon, steak tartare, sole meunière and, of course, the beloved steak au poivre. The French classic, updated by the chef Thierry Laurent, who's worked here for more than 20 years, is a vehicle for the aromatic Sarawak black pepper from Malaysia, which lends crunch and woody flavor to the filet of beef. It also adds a satisfying, earthy kick to the sauce: a pool of heavy cream, enlivened by the roughly crushed peppercorns and an Armagnac flambé, so thick that it bunches and pleats when pushed across the plate. -- Z.P.
18 Rue Paul Bert, 11th Arrondissement.
Hirayama: We have enormous respect for the owner, Bertrand, who settled in the 11th when it was clearly not hip. He's still the godfather, the one to represent all the restaurants in the area. At Paul Bert, it's about comfort ­­-- the service, the food that's kind of typical but well done, the history of the area and of the French bistro itself.
Koreitem: After the [original Covid-19] confinement in Paris, when restaurants were shut for three [or so] months, our first outing was at Paul Bert, and I ordered the steak au poivre, and it was just the most exquisite thing I'd ever had in my life. It should never change.
Greenspan: You can't reserve a table online, and that makes it a little harder for some people. But I think he really cares about keeping these dishes alive and vibrant and real.
23. The Sweetbreads at Amarante
A word of warning greets would-be diners on the Amarante website: Are you and the restaurant mutually compatible? Do you have the same likes (butter, not-overcooked meat and fish) and dislikes (elaborately plated dishes, Coca-Cola)? If it's a match, email or text the chef Christophe Philippe's cell any time of day to arrange your next visit. Here, the décor is understated -- red faux-leather banquettes, menus in a generic font straight out of a desktop inkjet printer -- as is the ethos of the kitchen, which makes use of many off-cuts, from brains to caul fat, and forgoes all spices except for salt and pepper. Everything revolves around primary ingredients: unembellished, deboned pig's trotter, simultaneously gelatinous and crunchy; buttery foraged escargots; and, best of all, veal sweetbreads, which are first prepared sous-vide and then cooked on a plancha beneath a cloche, their crispy, bronzed exterior giving way to milky richness inside. The more decadent the main, the simpler the side: This one's accompanied by satiny potato purée, and the sauce comes from one of two pots in which the week's bones simmer all day and night. It's not exactly a fire hazard, as Chef Philippe lives down the hall. -- Z.P.
4 Rue Biscornet, 12th Arrondissement.
Rose: It's crispy but soft inside. The thing is, in France, if you [source from] the right places, the products are just so good. You don't have to do too much to them.
24. The Trippa Alla Romana at Passerini
At the chef Giovanni Passerini's original restaurant, the trippa alla Romana are always available, even when not listed on the menu. This is offal for nonbelievers, a parade of textures -- sponge, honeycomb, mille-feuille, wrinkles, coral -- sliced into small pieces. Topped by bright and tangy tomato sauce and ribbons of mint crisscrossing through Pecorino Romano, the tripes are nourishing and tender. It's one of only a few sacrosanct recipes at this handsome corner spot, where most plates reference the Roman chef's transalpine heritage without too much fuss. Next door is Pastificio Passerini, which makes some of the best pasta in France. And by the end of dinner service, you may find the chef playing guitar across the street at the twinkling Passerina wine bar, which was opened by his wife and business partner, Justine Passerini, last year. "Everything that should be precise is precise," the chef says, "and everything else is festive chaos." -- Z.P.
65 Rue Traversière, 12th Arrondissement.
Koreitem: Moko and I go to the same places [over and over], where we know we're going to eat well, where we'll never be disappointed. Some of them are expected, in a way: I mentioned Passerini. But their trippa alla Romana is one thing we always go for. We love tripe, and he just does it to perfection, being that he's Roman.
25. The Vitello Tonnato at Racines
Passage des Panoramas is thought to be the oldest of the city's atmospheric covered shopping arcades. Inside, near a stamp shop and a duck-and-champagne restaurant, is the intimate bistro Racines, pleasantly moody even at lunch, aglow with votive candles and bathed in pale skylight-filtered sun. The vitello tonnato -- the only dish that has continuously been on the menu since the Sardinian chef Simone Tondo and his wife, Stefania Melis, relaunched the restaurant in 2017 -- embodies the polished, unpretentious bistrosteria style that Tondo has helped popularize. His take on the simple, cold Piedmontese classic is prettier than most, with rosy pink veal slices carved from the open-kitchen counter. The tonnato sauce, king of the pantry, is made with jarred albacore tuna, petite Pantelleria capers and Sicilian anchovies -- all preserved in olive oil, some of which is later drizzled on top. For dessert, linger over a tiramisù or panna cotta or simply wait for the complimentary cream puff brought out on a doily-lined silver dish at the end of the meal. -- Z.P.
8 Passage des Panoramas, Second Arrondissement.
Hirayama: It's just so [expletive] delicious. Even in Italy, it's not as good. I don't know what he does.
And to Bring Home ...
If there's anything uniting the selections above, it's the high-quality agricultural products and purveyors to which Parisians have enviable access. And while fruits, vegetables and calves' livers may be difficult to smuggle internationally, every panelist agreed that you can -- and should -- pack a few treats in your carry-on. "Obviously, butter in France is one of the most exciting things," says Rose, alluding to the array of cultured options available at good grocers in town (don't forget an ice pack). "You need a great cheese on this list," Greenspan says. "An aged Comté or a perfectly ripe, raw milk Mont d'Or that's so runny you can only serve it with a spoon." For the dairy averse, or those who don't want to risk confiscation at customs, Greenspan recommends sweets. "Mazet is an old candy company -- from 1636," she says. "It's being brought into the 21st century, and the pralines are good." Or just go to Hirayama and Koreitem's Mokonuts for lunch and leave with some extra cookies -- in flavors like chocochunk, miso and sesame or black olives and white chocolate (pictured above) -- which others concur would have made the top 25 had the rules allowed. -- K.S.

Full text: What's Up? (Feb. 5-11)
An A.I. Arms Race
Microsoft's often-overlooked search engine, Bing, is mounting a comeback with ChatGPT, the suddenly ubiquitous chatbot capable of composing song lyrics, writing academic essays and answering all manner of questions. The new version of Bing was released to a limited group of users on Tuesday. The revamped product is part of Microsoft's $ 13 billion investment in OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab behind ChatGPT that Microsoft is betting on to stay competitive with its big tech rivals like Google, Apple and Meta. But those companies are also racing to incorporate the new technology into their own software. A day before the unveiling of the new Bing, Google announced that it would soon release an experimental chatbot called Bard for its own search engine, which is much more widely used than Bing. And Meta is fast-tracking the development of chatbot technology for its products.
Biden Defends His Record
In President Biden's second State of the Union address, he focused on the bright spots in the economy. He emphasized that inflation was falling, the job market was strong and the best was yet to come. He pointed to the many benefits from his infrastructure, climate and manufacturing laws, which together would invest trillions of dollars in the United States. Mr. Biden also urged Congress to support initiatives like renewing the expanded child tax credit, which had cut child poverty almost in half, and affordable child care. In the days leading up to his speech, his top aides were divided over how much time he should spend on these issues, with some preferring that the president focused instead on parts of his legislative agenda that had already passed. As he heads into a re-election campaign, Mr. Biden's handling of the economy will be front and center.
Lean Times at the Magic Kingdom
Robert Iger, Disney's chief executive who was brought back by the board to turn the company around, presented his vision last week for more austere operations. On Thursday, Disney beat analysts' expectations for quarterly earnings: The company lost far less than it did in the previous quarter, and Disney's domestic theme parks delivered operating profits that were 36 percent higher from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Iger announced plans to cut costs by some $ 5.5 billion and lay off roughly 7,000 employees, or about 4 percent of the company's global work force. Investors, who had been eagerly awaiting a road map from Mr. Iger, sent Disney's stock up 5 percent in after-hours trading. And although the activist investor Nelson Peltz later dropped his bid for a seat on Disney's board, Mr. Iger still faces significant challenges. His company is struggling to make streaming profitable as its traditional television profits tumble, and Disney remains at odds with Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.
What's Next? (Feb. 12-18)
Fresh Inflation Data
This week's Consumer Price Index report is not the first of the year, but it is the first that will include a snapshot of inflation in 2023. The report is expected to show that inflation continued to drift lower in January, extending a trend line from December that prompted Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, to declare that the "disinflationary process has started." The central bank has begun to slow down its aggressive pace of interest rate increases to assess the effects of its policy, and officials will be closely watching the C.P.I. report and other data to understand where the economy is headed. But Mr. Powell has been clear that the Fed's campaign to tame inflation is not yet over.
Speaking of Inflation
Consumer prices may be cooling in general, but many big companies have continued to boldly raise their prices, finding that the increases have not for the most part deterred customers from spending. Last week, both PepsiCo and Unilever reported double-digit price increases for their products -- 16 percent at the beverage company and 13 percent in the case of the multinational consumer conglomerate -- in their quarterly results. Both also beat Wall Street expectations for revenue. This week, some version of this narrative is likely to crop up in Coca-Cola's fourth-quarter earnings report. Last quarter, the company generated higher-than-expected profits largely with the help of a 12 percent increase in prices for its soft drinks and juices.
Potential New Limits on Beijing
In an effort to restrict Beijing's access to advanced technologies that could be wielded against the United States in wartime, the Biden administration has been preparing regulations that would limit U.S. firms' investments in Chinese technology. Even though the United States already monitors China's investments in U.S. technology, and bans American companies from selling certain technologies directly to China, it has not applied the same scrutiny to money flowing in the other direction. The Chinese spy balloon that recently spent five days floating over the United States only intensified concerns about China's economic and military ambitions. Still, there are worries about Mr. Biden's potential new rules for American companies: Industry groups have argued that the policy being considered could backfire on the United States, harming its own economy and competitiveness.
What Else?
The struggling retailer Bed Bath & Beyond secured the help of Hudson Bay Capital Management in its plan to sell its stock and avoid bankruptcy. Credit Suisse on Thursday reported its biggest annual loss since the 2008 financial crisis. Russia's deputy prime minister said the country would cut its oil production in March by 500,000 barrels a day, or about 5 percent of its output; oil prices rose on Friday after the news.

12 Trans Americans On Transgender Rights: [Sunday Review Desk]

Author: Healy, Patrick; Rivera, Adrian J

Abstract: None available.

Full text: THESE days, "transgender" has become a charged word, associated with arguments over identity, gender, pronouns, sports, puberty blockers and civil rights. But for many of the approximately 1.3 million transgender Americans today, the word isn't a topic for debate; it's who they are. And the questions and fights over being transgender often feel beside the point. Why are so many nontrans Americans judging and opining about trans adults and children rather than listening to them? We spoke with 12 transgender Americans from across the country and the political spectrum to try to better understand what their lives are like. In the course of our conversation, it became clear that while our participants had some common experiences -- 11 of them said they'd experienced discrimination or harassment as a consequence of their trans identity, several said they'd had fraught experiences choosing which restroom to use, and some knew they were trans at a very young age -- no two trans experiences are exactly the same. Some participants had families supportive of who they are; others did not. There was no uniform perspective on when or whether children should be allowed to transition or on whether there was too much or not enough media coverage of trans issues (and whether that coverage was getting it right). But fundamentally, all participants wanted basic respect -- to be seen as people, not stereotypes or caricatures or a minority to be lectured to. "I think people might assume that I am unwilling to see our shared humanity," said Forest, a 26-year-old in the group. "In reality, I'm actually trying really hard to see people who I disagree with as also human, just like me, who have positives and negatives, who have different experiences but who might still be able to change their minds and care about other people, too. I'm trying to."
PARTICIPANTS Amber 47, Dem., Latinx Chanel 38, Dem., Black C.J. 57, ind., white Forest 26, Dem., mixed race Joey 46, ind., white Joseph 37, Dem., white Kayla 28, Dem., Black Michelle 54, ind., white Milo 40, Dem., white Phunky 19, Dem., Black Tavona 27, ind., Black Wyatt 31, Dem., white
When did you realize you were trans? Michelle: I always pretty much knew. Since I was 5, I used to dress in my mom's stuff. I tried to suppress it. I went in the Army, tried all the macho stuff. I said, "This ain't right," because I was brought up in a stricter time. One day, I just couldn't do it anymore. I woke up and told my wife. She went ballistic. I thought maybe this is something we could work out together, and she didn't want to. She said, "I don't want to live with another woman." And I said, "Well, this is what I want to do. I'm going to transition fully, and I plan to in the next five years." Kayla: I came out as bisexual at first. Then I started seeing other trans people, and I had kind of a conflict. I wondered, "Am I attracted to these people, or do I want to be these people?" And then, wanting to transition, I asked myself, "Am I doing this because I want the privilege of passing as a man?" My partner was not supportive, interestingly enough, even though she was a very big L.G.B.T.Q. advocate where I lived. We broke up. But it wasn't until I started immersing myself into the queer community that I really started to feel who I actually was. C.J.: I knew really early, as far back as I can remember. So 2, 3? People would ask me, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" I'd say, "A man." I just assumed that that's what I would be when I grew up, that it was going to change. Moderator: How many of you have experienced discrimination or harassment because of your trans identity? [Eleven participants raise a hand.] Is this something that happens frequently? Has it happened recently? Wyatt: Just, like, dumb bathroom stuff. I've been harassed in the bathroom before for going to the "wrong" one. But what do you want me to do? Should I just go in between the bathrooms? Kayla: I pass as what society would consider a man. I've been to a bar in D.C. where the men's bathroom just had urinals, and there was a long line for the women's. I hate when I have to out myself just to relieve myself. I get so much anxiety. If I walk in and there's not a stall or not a door on the stall, I pray someone doesn't walk in. That's where a lot of the harassment for myself happens. Tavona: I definitely agree. The times where I have been harassed, I've been trying to use the restroom. I'm on active-duty military. I'm in the Navy, so we all share a ship. To be politically correct, my sex marker hasn't changed, so I have to shower and use the restroom that the females use, and that's a bit of a challenge. Phunky: My friends and I are all very visibly queer. A lot of times I dress up very, very visibly queer, and people are constantly looking at me, constantly taking pictures of me, constantly making comments, you know? Joseph: I wish I could have said zero. I have actively been harassed, had graffiti and all that on my apartment, my lockers at work. I've been chased by pickup trucks when I was walking home at night and had beer bottles smashed up against my head just because of who I am. In the last couple of years, do you think things are getting better or worse for trans Americans? Milo: I'm comparing from the Trump administration to now, so I think the bar is low. There's a little bit more openness from this administration. Phunky:I live in New York, and there's a lot of accessibility for being trans. A lot of surgeries can get covered with your insurance, and there's a big queer community here, so it's very easy to be accepted and to find trans friends and queer friends. Mutual aid is really big here, too. I feel like there are a lot more resources than -- I would say, I don't know -- in the '90s. C.J.: I think that's a tricky question. Because like somebody mentioned, it got really dicey when Trump was in. And we still have some politicians acting like juveniles. Amber: When it comes to the politics, I pretty much keep to myself. I'm more concerned with the finances. That's what I do for a living. So I see the numbers, and it's going to take a few years for the economy to roll back. I think that once that happens, things will definitely change for the better. When it comes to safety, I feel like I'm in a moderate to safe zone. Joseph:I don't want to be a whole downer, but it almost feels like we're losing the ground we've gained. We continue to get more acceptance and visibility. But when Roe v. Wade was taken away by the courts -- I'm honestly terrified that they're going to find a way to take even more away in some way. Moderator: What do you think is standing in the way of things getting better for transgender people? Kayla: Cis white men. That's who makes up our government. That's who's making all these dumb decisions. They're focusing on the wrong things as well, the whole anti-trans legislation across several states. The most dangerous, I think, was the one in Texas when they were reporting parents to C.P.S. for supporting their trans kid. C.J.:Well, there's too much negative coverage and not enough positive coverage. Moderator: Is there something that the news media is missing when it talks about trans issues? Kayla: They're not reporting on the right things, or they report on something, and things just get completely twisted. Facts are wrong, deadnaming people. It's just not actually information, I guess. Like they're not actually spreading actual facts or actual news. I feel like a lot of it ends up supporting a lot of misconceptions about trans people. Moderator: Sometimes when I speak with groups of people who don't consider themselves part of the transgender community, they say they are worried they might get in trouble if they say the wrong thing or use the wrong pronoun. What do you think when people say these things? Joseph: I would rather somebody actually make the effort to try and fail and be corrected at it and actually go, "OK, sorry," and just move on. Put in the effort. Forest: People say they're worried about saying the wrong thing. I know that you're worried. I can feel it. And I can't make you understand. But if you try to see from my perspective, then I'm pretty sure your imagination will allow you to see from my perspective. Kayla: If you're scared of saying the wrong thing, go educate yourself. And if you do say something wrong, don't get defensive after. It's not my job to then carry your feelings. Within my community, people know that I'm a person that they can come to if they want to talk or if they want more information. But not every trans person is that person. So don't expect an education lesson. Moderator: How, if at all, do you think ideas around gender identity should be discussed and taught in schools -- elementary school, junior high school, high school? Joey: I think it should be taught early on because some kids may not be aware of how they're feeling. It would have helped me if it had been taught early on. Wyatt: Yeah. I mean there are lots of kids' books that are totally appropriate that just talk about gender in a general way. "Red: A Crayon's Story" is a good one. Chanel: Yeah, I think the sooner, the better. I taught elementary for 10 years, and it was something that I always tied into my lessons. I don't think a lot of people recognize that racism, transphobic, homophobic thoughts are learned at a young age. Tavona: I see where Chanel is coming from, but I also think that gender identity should not be taught prior to maybe high school. I just feel like the younger, the more impressionable. Not only will they be trying to figure out other things, aside from themselves, but adding in gender identity is just a bit too much for younger kids, I think. Do you have any thoughts on the question of when young people with gender dysphoria should be allowed to begin transitioning? Michelle: I guess between the age of 13 and maybe 18, somewhere around there. It's a confusing time, so I think that it starts with family first. They got to decide for their child. If their child comes up to them and says, "Look, something's not right here," then have a discussion with that child first. I really don't think there's any place for school here because, to me, it's more of a personal medical issue, a political or social issue. Amber: Family is going to be your main support. It's going to be up to the family, the parents. Moderator: How do you think parents should approach a young person or teenager who says they're interested in transitioning? Amber: Get your sources, get your information, get your education. I'm in my late 40s now. If I would have known about these groups much sooner, I know I would have stepped up and taken those actions before I told my mom. Phunky: I don't know how I feel about children medically transitioning at a young age. That's based on their individual situation. There are things they could do that could help them affirm their gender, like changing their clothes or hairstyle or things like that. But if the child doesn't have a supportive family, I feel like the school should have some type of peer counseling where these kids could be able to talk about this in a safe space. Moderator: Is there an age that's too young? Phunky: As long as there's nothing irreversible, as long as you can go back on it, your child should be able to transition. I see a lot of children that do transition at a young age, and they don't detransition or start questioning their gender. But I do feel like it should be more of a one-on-one thing. Joseph:If I could have had the chance to actually transition or even just start H.R.T. from a younger age, I would have taken it and not had a second thought. Far too many kids are out there without information about transitioning, and some even consider taking their own lives because they get in a situation where they don't have any support. Moderator: What would you say to parents who say they're conflicted or uncomfortable with teenagers taking puberty blockers? Phunky: I'm 19. I feel like people should be able to have more responsibility, and I feel like it's very important to affirm your child and your teenager. You don't know what your child is going through. You don't know what your teenager is going through. There's so many trans people that would have loved to be on H.R.T. when they were a teen, would have loved to start their transition. And I feel like there's not enough recognition around that. Forest: Why did you have a kid? Did you have a child so that you could model that child after you, or did you have a child so that you could bring a person into the world who is capable of and confident in making their own decisions? Michelle: I believe if the child believes that they want to be that way, they should go to a psychiatrist, talk to counselors, maybe talk to someone in the trans community and everything else first before you even start that. Because once it starts, it's a slippery slope. C.J.: As a parent, you're responsible for that child until they're 18, and the frontal lobe's not developed until 24. That being said, I knew who I was my entire life. Being supported and being able to be who I was was great. I could have done it at 17 or 18, had I known how and had the resources. Then it wouldn't have been the parent's responsibility. Moderator: Is there anything that you would want to leave New York Times readers with, as just a final thought? C.J.: Trans people are just people. Not pedophiles and not perverts. Kayla: Stop trying to understand us. If you're not trans, you never will. I feel like a lot of times, people are just trying to make sense of us in their head, and I need you to stop trying to make sense and just respect us as people. We're human beings, and we're just going to live our lives just like you are living your lives. Stop trying to understand and interject yourself and just listen. Joey: Just love everybody and let everybody be who they want to be. Chanel:I have a quote up in my living room. It says, "I was a woman born with a male defect. After decades of pressure to live with it, I finally fixed it. So why are people so hung up on transitioning? It was a revelation. I didn't become female. I've always been female." Milo: I think we all have a right to self-determination and to self-actualization. The more we just respect each other and trust that we are doing what's right for ourselves, I think it's just a happier society and a more loving community that we can create.

Washington, Ga. | $ 375,000
An early 19th-century farmhouse with five bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms, on a 0.5-acre lot
Originally two houses built around 1828, this home was joined into a single structure in the mid-19th century. The current owners bought it in 2019 and did an extensive renovation, working to preserve the original charm while updating the kitchen and bathrooms.
Washington is a small city, with a grocery store, a hardware store and several historic house museums within a few blocks of this property.

Full text: With "The Critic's Daughter: A Memoir," Priscilla Gilman, daughter of the theater critic Richard Gilman, joins the ranks of writers whose memoirs examine their famous, and flawed, fathers.
When Priscilla Gilman and her younger sister Claire were growing up as the only daughters of Lynn Nesbit, the high-powered literary agent, and Richard Gilman, the exacting drama critic and Yale professor, their bedtime stories were often read by publishing world superstars: Uncle Bern (Bernard Malamud), Aunt Ann (Ann Beattie) and Aunt Toni (Toni Morrison).
They introduced their stuffed animals to Jerzy Kosinski. At cocktail parties at the family's rambling apartment in Manhattan's Upper West Side, they passed the deviled eggs to Anatole Broyard, a charismatic critic and editor at The New York Times Book Review.
Nesbit was the driven breadwinner, not one for engaging in make-believe or rolling around on the floor with her children. Gilman, who died in 2006, was a champion of avant-garde theater, known to the world as a fearsome critic -- John Leonard, of The Times, once described his writing as "confrontation criticism." But at home, he was benevolent and forgiving, at least to his daughters.
As Priscilla Gilman, his eldest daughter, has written in her new book, "The Critic's Daughter: A Memoir," he was the kindly priest who presided over the cathedral of their childhood. With his professor's hours, he was the more present, playful and engaged parent, taking the girls out for pizza and to the library so their mother could work through the weekends. He delighted in reading aloud to them, never broke the third wall in the imaginative games at which he excelled, and often spoke in the gruff voice of his favorite alter ego, Grover the Muppet.
Gilman was 10 when her parents separated. Her father was left undone and adrift, sleeping on friends' couches, bedeviled by depression and darker urges that caused him shame. The book, out Feb. 7, is Priscilla Gilman's attempt to make sense of his fall from grace.
With it, she has joined the ranks of literary daughters who embarked on the same mission. That includes Bliss Broyard, daughter of Anatole, who investigated her father's not-so-secret secret -- that he was a Black man passing as white in the monolithically white publishing world -- in "One Drop: My Father's Hidden Life -- a Story of Race and Family Secrets," out in 2007. "Reading My Father," out in 2011 by Alexandra Styron, William Styron's youngest child, was another bracing rendition of life with a mighty, troubled man.
More recently, Ada Calhoun, daughter of the art critic Peter Schjeldahl, who died last fall, took on her father in her 2022 memoir, "Also a Poet: Frank O'Hara, My Father, and Me." Calhoun was still clamoring to be seen by her distant and often catastrophically neglectful parent; her lifelong efforts to distinguish herself -- notably, changing her surname at 22 -- now include her entry into this particular memoir-writer's club. Schjeldahl lived long enough to read the book, and praise her work.
"It's a universal story," said Gilman, now 52, who was on a recent Sunday at home in the bright, book-filled apartment she shares with her two sons in Washington Heights. She was warm and solicitous, a petite figure in a pale blue Icelandic sweater and bluejeans. Her ex, her sons' father, lives in the same building. "I always loved my father deeply, but the book was about finding a deeper sense of love, where you see the person for who they really are, rather than your projection of them or their most positive face."
After her parents split, Gilman, the family cheerleader and her father's favorite, made herself a list of "Things Not to Do When With Daddy: Don't Cry. Don't Complain. Don't Be Difficult. Don't Tell Him Anything but Good News. Don't Mention Mommy. Don't Expect Him to Be the Daddy of Old."
With his adjunct professor's salary, her father was unable to afford an apartment for some time. When he did, sleepovers with Dad were scenes of penury: treats were Fritos divvied up, 10 for each daughter, and one Coke, split between them, all served on plastic dishware from the family's former weekend house. "On the bright side," said Gilman, grinning, "we got Fritos!" (The snack was verboten in her mother's household.) He fought with his more successful ex over their assets, enraging Nesbit and shocking some of her friends, who made no attempt to hide their contempt for Gilman from his children.
In the aftermath of the separation, Gilman learned her father had had many affairs. He struggled with sexual urges of bondage and abasement, which he described in a letter he imprudently left lying around. A few years later, he wrote of his sexual alienation and a youthful, brief conversion to Catholicism -- Gilman was a Jewish atheist -- in "Faith, Sex, Mystery: A Memoir," out in 1987. His daughters were teenagers at the time. They read the reviews, but avoided the book.
Both parents were overly forthcoming with their eldest. "I was never in love with your father," Nesbit told her. "Sometimes I think I'd kill myself if it weren't for you girls," her father said.
"There was no discourse about how to talk to children about divorce in those days," Gilman said, still the peacemaker. "We all make mistakes as parents."
But oh, the fallout. After her own divorce and her father's death, Gilman writes, she fell in love with a rogue's gallery of tortured men "who teetered on the edge of insolvency or insanity, and desperately wanted me to nurture, bolster, save them." She found them "glamorously, sickeningly familiar." When one man tried to kill himself in front of her after she expressed doubts about the relationship, she writes, "It felt both utterly terrifying and weirdly normal." Primed by her upbringing to be hypervigilant to a partner's mood swings, she practiced her best buoying techniques.
Gilman has a Ph.D. in literature from Yale, where she was once a professor on the tenure track. She also taught at Vassar. But Gilman left academia when her eldest son, Benjamin, turned 7. Dazzlingly precocious -- he was spouting Robert Frost at two -- Benj, as his parents called him, was also averse to snuggling. He struggled with motor issues and social interactions. His diagnosis was hyperlexia, a kind of autism, among other conditions.
Her marriage, to a brilliant classmate who happened to be named Richard, would not survive. For four years after their split, she and her ex "nested" in their apartment. Gilman lived with her mother on her "off" days, working as an agent at Janklow & Nesbit, her mother's company.
To parent her unusual firstborn, she learned to narrate his experiences for him, giving him emotional cue cards she called the Sentences: "Today at school, Benjamin played at the water table. I love Benjamin very much. Benjamin is my son. Daddy is a wonderful man. We all love Daddy! Now it is time to print the sentences."
Gilman's astute and loving account of Benjamin's upbringing, "The Anti-Romantic Child," came out in 2011. The book is as much a memoir as it is an instruction manual in how to be a parent. It also teed up its author to write about her father.
"It was a love letter to my son," Gilman said, "but it was also a book I hoped would help people appreciate and admire the people in their lives who are a little bit different or unusual."
Of her own experience writing about her complicated father, Bliss Broyard said, "You see their actual size in the world, versus their size at home and their idealized public self. There's a sadness to it, a melancholic aspect, but it opens the door for a lot of empathy and connection."
Memoir casts a wide net, snaring many an author's nearest and dearest. Gilman did not ask her mother for permission to investigate their family story, but she declared her mission. At first, Nesbit wondered, as Gilman recalled, "'Is anybody going to care about your father? He was famous once but it was a long time ago.' When I explained how it was a universal story, she got it."
And Nesbit gamely answered her daughter's questions. Her most pressing was, "Why did you marry him?" Donald Barthelme, the minimalist novelist and short-story writer who died in 1989, had been Nesbit's first great love, and one of her first clients. (He called her "the mother of postmodernism.") She married Richard Gilman when that relationship fell apart.
Her daughter wanted Nesbit's answer in writing, and when she received it, by email, it was like a benediction: Nesbit wrote that she knew Gilman would be an excellent father, and that he was a kind and ethical man. It was the answer her daughter had waited 40 years to hear. She recalled sobbing at her desk.
Later, Nesbit said that she would skip the memoir, but supported her daughter. "Priscilla is a writer and she needs to do what she needs to do," she said. "We have a strong relationship and she obviously had a very complicated and intense one with her father."
That's just fine with Gilman. "My mother won't read the book," she said, "but she trusts me to tell the truth."

The Candy That Speaks Volumes About Society: [National Desk]

Full text: Of the many siblings in the seasonal candy family, candy corn is the quirky breakout star. The jelly bean is the reliable one. The candy cane is perpetually cheerful.
But the conversation heart? It's always been emotional and a bit needy.
The chalky little treats require annual tending. Months before each Valentine's Day, candy companies begin pondering new messages and editing out the dated ones. (Looking at you, "On Fleek.") The dozen or so fresh sayings must be both current and inoffensive, charming and clever. And they can't overshadow classic expressions of romantic love, like "Kiss Me," that were first inscribed in 1902 by the Boston company that had invented the Necco Wafer.
After more than a century of expressing emotion in the vernacular of the moment -- "Call Me" became "Fax Me" became "Page Me" became "Email Me" became "Text Me" -- the candy heart has become something of a barometer. If the former Destiny's Child singer Michelle Williams can stage her comeback with a song about candy corn, maybe the nation can gauge the state of love through its candy hearts.
For 2023, the Spangler Candy Company -- one of two manufacturers that dominate the conversation-heart market -- has chosen an animal theme for its Sweethearts line. Phrases like "Big Dog," "Love Birds" and "Purr Fect" are a nod to all the people who have acquired pets during the pandemic.
Last year, as the nation was still recovering, the company introduced 16 supportive slogans like "Youda Best," "Fear Less" and "Good Job." The idea, the company said, was to give people a lift.
Fans of more passionate slogans may not have been pleased, but Helen Fisher, a senior research fellow at the Kinsey Institute and the author of six books on love, sex and the brain, said the less amorous messages marked a cultural turning point.
"These candy hearts are yet another expression of this huge societal change since the pandemic," she said. "It's this theme of attachment. Much of the world is going to settle down, and along with that they're looking not only for romantic love but also for deep, long-term attachment."
Valentine's Day sweets make up only about 3 percent of candy sales, and it would be easy to dismiss conversation hearts as mere currency for grade school crushes. But about 23 percent of households buy non-chocolate candies for the holiday, including talking hearts. Millennial and Generation X households with children are the biggest fans of Valentine's sugar candy, according to IRI, a global market research firm.
The team writing the mottoes for next year's batch of Sweethearts has already developed a new theme aimed at that demographic sweet spot. But before we get to where the conversation is headed, it helps to know where it's been.
The candy heart was born during the lozenge craze of the mid-1800s, when apothecaries sold medicated candies to soothe sore throats and suppress coughs. (Some included morphine and heroin, ingredients that were later dropped.)
Making lozenges by hand was time-consuming. In 1847, a Boston pharmacist named Oliver Chase invented a machine that would stamp out medicinal versions from sugar paste. Since he was working in what was then the country's candy-manufacturing center, he shifted gears and founded what would become the New England Confectionery Company, or Necco.
Almost 20 years later, Mr. Chase's brother began using a felt pad and red vegetable dye to stamp words onto the candy. The company cut dough into shapes like kites and baseballs, called them motto lozenges and embossed them with extended locutions like "How long shall I have to wait? Please be considerate," "Mother knows I'm out" and "Married in pink, he will take to drink."
The hearts came along in 1902. The basic recipe -- about 90 percent sugar, with a little corn syrup and glycerin -- hasn't changed much. Flavors from the period like clove and sassafras have given way to an ambiguous array of what might best be called fruit-adjacent flavors, and wintergreen.
In 2010, Necco changed the formula, softening the texture and adding new, bolder fruit flavors. Blue raspberry replaced wintergreen. Like New Coke, the rebuilt hearts bombed.
"Simply put, they're a mess," one candy blogger wrote. The company reworked the recipe to better resemble the original.
For decades, the Necco hearts monopolized the market, until Brach's jumped in during the 1950s. That company tried out tropical fruit flavors and for a limited time sold plastic boats filled with hearts called Friend Ships. A line of candies called Wisecracks! End the Conversation Hearts, with slogans like "Nope" and "4 Never," was introduced in 2021. This year, Brach's has hearts with catchphrases from the sitcom "Friends," like "Moo Point."
Brach's officials have pointed out that their candies are laser-printed, producing a cleaner look than traditional stamping, which can result in misshapen hearts and blurred letters. (A member of the Necco production crew told a writer for The Atlantic in 2013 that because P's sometimes emerged looking like F's, the company had stopped using phrases that started with P.)
Candy-heart lovers split into camps. "Brach's may not be able to take credit for printing salacious messages on candy hearts, but at least they had the decency to offer texture and flavor," said Mike Pomranz, a food writer who once argued that Sweethearts were just reshaped Necco Wafers and that Brach's softer texture made theirs superior.
By 2019, Brach's hearts were bigger sellers than the originals. The brand now commands 60 percent of the market for conversation hearts, which are the best-selling Valentine's Day candy, said Katie Duffy, the vice president and general manager of seasonal candy at the Ferrara Candy Company, which owns Brach's.
But even Brach's loyalists bow down to the history contained in more than a century of sayings, which over time became limited to the nine letters that fit on a tiny heart -- fewer if they use a W.
"The One I Love" and "I'll See You Home," popular in the early 1900s, fell out of fashion long ago, along with "Go Fly a Kite" and "Excuse My Dust." The dust also gathered on "23 Skidoo" and "O! You Kid."
"We knew those corny expressions didn't mean a thing to moderns," Margaret M. Kedian, the public relations director for Necco, told The Daily Boston Globe in 1950.
About that time, the company was stumped for new material, so it asked its sales staff to send back slang expressions from the road. "Going My Way" and "What Gives" had brief star turns, along with, "My Aching Back."
By the 1980s, "Hep Cat" and "Hubba Hubba" had outlived their audience. "You're Gay" was retired for obvious reasons.
For decades, the task of editing Necco's 80 to 125 sayings each year fell to the candy executive Walter Marshall. He solicited suggestions and drew inspiration from the world around him, using more intuition than market research to pick the winners. He liked "You Go Girl," which his granddaughter heard on Rosie O'Donnell's talk show. He accepted "Awesome" but rejected "Phat."
For a few years after Mr. Marshall retired in 2000, the company picked themes that were less about love and more about, well, anything. In 2003, it pursued an education angle, with "Let's Read" and "Wise Up." In 2005, a banner year for New England's professional sports teams, messages included "Be a Sport" and "Cheer Me On." Even the weather had its moment, in 2008, with "Heat Wave" and "In a Fog."
And on it went, some five billion little hearts a year, until Necco filed for bankruptcy in 2018. It sold its Sweethearts, Necco Wafers and Canada Mints brands for nearly $ 19 million to the family-owned Spangler Candy Company, an Ohio firm that also churns out Dum-Dums and orange marshmallow Circus Peanuts.
In a crushing blow to first graders everywhere, there were no boxes of Sweethearts to exchange in 2019. Spangler, which began making the hearts in Mexico, couldn't get the equipment ready in time. But the hearts were back the following year, and the new owners wrote their first set of messages. They went with the classics: "QT Pie," "Sweet Talk" and "UR Mine."
Then came 2021, the year of pep talk, and this year, with its "Paw Some" pet messages.
Which brings us to plans for 2024. Spangler has hired Tombras, the ad agency, to create Sweethearts' first TikTok and Instagram accounts and help write new sayings.
The company won't reveal them yet, but there is a theme. Despite Spangler's newfound digital push, 2024 will be all about IRL, said Reise Kitts, who manages the account for Tombras.
"Anyone can go online and give likes out like candy," he said. "Why not give candy out to show someone you like them for real?"
Not everyone is cheering.
"I've yet to hear of a couple whose courtship started with 'Crazy 4 U,"' said Mr. Pomranz, the food writer. "I feel like you're better off opening with a more substantial candy like a full-size 3 Musketeers. That's love."

From ‘Be Mine’ to ‘Youda Best,’ the Candy Conversation Evolves

Of the many siblings in the seasonal candy family, candy corn is the quirky breakout star. The jelly bean is the reliable one. The candy cane is perpetually cheerful.
But the conversation heart? It’s always been emotional and a bit needy.
The chalky little treats require annual tending. Months before each Valentine’s Day, candy companies begin pondering new messages and editing out the dated ones. (Looking at you, “On Fleek.”) The dozen or so fresh sayings must be both current and inoffensive, charming and clever. And they can’t overshadow classic expressions of romantic love, like “Kiss Me,” that were first inscribed in 1902 by the Boston company that had invented the Necco Wafer.
After more than a century of expressing emotion in the vernacular of the moment — “Call Me” became “Fax Me” became “Page Me” became “Email Me” became “Text Me” — the candy heart has become something of a barometer. If former Destiny’s Child singer Michelle Williams can stage her comeback with a song about candy corn, maybe the nation can gauge the state of love through its candy hearts.
For 2023, the Spangler Candy Co. — one of two manufacturers that dominate the conversation-heart market — has chosen an animal theme for its Sweethearts line. Phrases like “Big Dog,” “Love Birds” and “Purr Fect” are a nod to all the people who have acquired pets during the pandemic.
Last year, as the nation was still recovering, the company introduced 16 supportive slogans like “Youda Best,” “Fear Less” and “Good Job.” The idea, the company said, was to give people a lift.
Fans of more passionate slogans may not have been pleased, but Helen Fisher, a senior research fellow at the Kinsey Institute and the author of six books on love, sex and the brain, said the less amorous messages marked a cultural turning point.
“These candy hearts are yet another expression of this huge societal change since the pandemic,” she said. “It’s this theme of attachment. Much of the world is going to settle down, and along with that, they’re looking not only for romantic love but also for deep, long-term attachment.”
Valentine’s Day sweets make up only about 3% of candy sales, and it would be easy to dismiss conversation hearts as mere currency for grade school crushes. But about 23% of households buy nonchocolate candies for the holiday, including talking hearts. Millennial and Generation X households with children are the biggest fans of Valentine’s sugar candy, according to IRI, a global market research firm.
The team writing the mottoes for next year’s batch of Sweethearts has already developed a new theme aimed at that demographic sweet spot. But before we get to where the conversation is headed, it helps to know where it has been.
The candy heart was born during the lozenge craze of the mid-1800s, when apothecaries sold medicated candies to soothe sore throats and suppress coughs. (Some included morphine and heroin, ingredients that were later dropped.)
Making lozenges by hand was time-consuming. In 1847, a Boston pharmacist named Oliver Chase invented a machine that would stamp out medicinal versions from sugar paste. Since he was working in what was then the country’s candy-manufacturing center, he shifted gears and founded what would become the New England Confectionery Co., or Necco.
Almost 20 years later, Chase’s brother began using a felt pad and red vegetable dye to stamp words onto the candy. The company cut dough into shapes like kites and baseballs, called them motto lozenges and embossed them with extended locutions like “How long shall I have to wait? Please be considerate,” “Mother knows I’m out” and “Married in pink, he will take to drink.”
The hearts came along in 1902. The basic recipe — about 90% sugar, with a little corn syrup and glycerin — hasn’t changed much. Flavors from the period like clove and sassafras have given way to an ambiguous array of what might best be called fruit-adjacent flavors, and wintergreen.
In 2010, Necco changed the formula, softening the texture and adding new, bolder fruit flavors. Blue raspberry replaced wintergreen. Like New Coke, the rebuilt hearts bombed.
“Simply put, they’re a mess,” one candy blogger wrote. The company reworked the recipe to better resemble the original.

Fashion Industry Still Worships Skinniness: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In Paris last month, at the Chanel couture show, there was something about one model that set her apart from the others on the runway.
Strikingly beautiful, Jill Kortleve has almond-shaped eyes, dark bushy eyebrows and chiseled cheekbones. Since her runway debut for Alexander McQueen in 2018, she has appeared on many magazine covers, modeled in Versace, MaxMara and Jacquemus shows, and starred in advertising campaigns for Valentino Beauty and Fendi, to name but a few.
But what makes her an unusual star for the high fashion industry is not the fact that she is 29, making her older than many of her peers, or that she is 5-foot-8, making her shorter than many of them too. It is the fact that Ms. Kortleve is a U.S. size 8 to 10 -- or "midsize," as the middle ground between petite and plus size is increasingly known. "Straight" size, or under a U.S. size 2, remains, overwhelmingly, the fashion industry norm.
Plus-size models, typically those above a U.S. size 12, have become better represented in high fashion. "Curve" models like Paloma Elsesser, Precious Lee and Ashley Graham have thriving careers.
For years, however, Ms. Kortleve has been one of the only midsize models of note. In January, she was the only midsize model cast by Chanel for its couture show. There were a handful of others at shows like Valentino, but last season Ms. Kortleve was the only midsize model to be cast by the marquee names on the couture calendar.
Diversity on the runways (or the lack of it) has come under intense scrutiny in recent years. So at a time when midsize fashion is gaining momentum elsewhere -- in mass market apparel branding and on TikTok, where the #midsize hashtag has more than four billion views -- why is it still overlooked by the overlords of luxury fashion? And, in 2023, what does midsize -- or average -- sizing even mean?
'Still the Only One'
Much of the data on the average dress size in key consumer markets is out of date. Widely cited statistics that suggest the average dress size worn by British and American women is a 16 are generally from studies published in 2016 or earlier.
How certain sizes translate into measurements has shifted over time and varies substantially from brand by brand and garment to garment, which is one of the reasons millions of women find it so hard to buy clothing that fits.
"It's impossible to say with any real accuracy what the average clothing size is for a woman in the U.S.," Renee Engeln, the director of the Body and Media Lab at Northwestern University, wrote in an email. She declined to pin down midsize or plus size with a specific range.
"The landscape of women's fashion is inaccessible to many body types not because we don't understand how big or small the 'average woman' is," Dr. Engeln said. "It is because major players in the fashion industry still choose to exclude women whose bodies are inconsistent with the brand image they want to cultivate."
Ms. Kortleve, who is Dutch and partly of Surinamese heritage, may be riding high now, but she had a distressing foray into modeling after she moved to Amsterdam at 18. She was determined to be a successful "straight" size model and a size 0. She struggled at both.
"I was dieting constantly, 24/7, trying so hard to conform to the industry standard," Ms. Kortleve said in a freezing and windswept Amsterdam earlier this month. "I was antisocial, miserable and never 'thin' enough to get booked anyway, so it felt like I was starving myself for nothing."
"I had this fixed idea in my head of how models had to look in order to be successful," she continued as she sipped on a (non-diet) Coke. "My hips measured 92 centimeters, and that was still so far from good enough. For context, they measure 105 centimeters today. Finally I reached a breaking point mentally and physically. I had to walk away."
Walking away meant a long trip to Bali and getting "SELF LOVE" tattooed on her hands before returning to modeling in 2018 at a more healthy weight -- fortuitously at a time when wider depictions of beauty were emerging on high fashion runways. That September, she was booked, a virtual unknown, for an Alexander McQueen show. Thereafter, castings became more frequent until 2020, when headlines touted her as the first curve or plus-size model to walk at a Chanel show since Crystal Renn a full decade before.
Except Ms Kortleve was -- and is -- roughly a U.S. size 10. Which, outside the fashion industry, is very few people's idea of plus.
"It is problematic, for sure," Ms. Kortleve said. "I am clearly not a plus-size model, and putting me in that box takes away from the experiences that my plus-size peers have had, like not being able to find their size in a store, which is something I've never had at my size."
"I don't want to be put under any label or box, be it straight or midsize or plus size or anything else," she added.
These days, Ms. Kortleve said, people want to look in magazines or on Instagram and feel represented, particularly younger consumers. "Brands know that casting someone of a more ordinary weight like me -- what you keep calling midsize -- helps them appear closer to achieving that for customers. Even if often I am still the only one of that size there."
A Midsize Movement -- or Moment?
Alexandra van Houtte, the chief executive of Tagwalk, a fashion search engine, noted that while her platform has reference tags for 83 curve models, only three midsize models currently exist on the Tagwalk database: Ms. Kortleve, Celina Ralph and, most recently, Ajok Daing.
During the last ready-to-wear season in September, Ms. van Houtte said, more than half of all fashion week shows still had no models who weren't a dress size 0 or 2, perhaps not coincidentally at a time when ultrathin bodies appear to be back.
"Sadly, I feel like we have actually slipped backward on the runways in terms of size representation -- especially in Europe," said Kenya Hunt, the editor of Elle UK. After years of body positivity momentum, size inclusivity has stalled, in contrast to improved representation of race, as well as age and gender. Ultimately, these models can tick those diversity boxes while still being thin.
"If a model like Jill Kortleve keeps being presented to us as plus size, that alienates an entire group of women who are bigger than that," Ms. Hunt said. "It's embarrassing that an exclusionary mentality still underpins so much of this industry."
But the ordinary has long been rejected by high fashion, a world that loves to shock through visual extremes. Bony ribs (ideally) or ripples of undulating flesh (occasionally) on a runway or campaign shoot somehow seem preferable to highlighting a body that's reflective of a more "boring" middle ground. This may be a reason models with figures like Ms. Kortleve's remain underrepresented.
"A lot of model casting during fashion week is feeling increasingly performative again," said Mina White, an agent at IMG Models who added Ms. Kortleve to her roster last year. "Only one or even two curve or midsize models per show does not reflect meaningful change or true inclusivity. It's tokenism, especially if any size diversity in front of the camera is still not translating into runway fashion in mid- or plus-sizing being available on the shop floor."
Though it may be overlooked by the fashion mainstream, thousands of TikTok users who see themselves in the midsize category are creating content, including try-on hauls of midsize-friendly fashion brands and copycat outfits of luxury looks they aren't able to buy. Others offer tips on how to dress to emphasize your best features and downplay the ones you feel less confident about; there are also discussions of the manipulative power of fatphobic marketing and how to rise above it.
And despite these uplifting notes, social media can, of course, offer a portal to "thinspiration" pages and toxic messaging. But Ms. Kortleve is encouraged to see young people call out body shaming and create their own body-positive movement if fashion isn't going to give it to them.
"It makes me happy, honestly, and relieved," she said. "I feel real responsibility to represent women with a body like mine in the fashion world, but there is such pressure, too. Like, if I don't walk, or say no to a show, are they going to book another midsize girl? Or just book the old standard size and slip backward again?"
Both Ms. Kortleve and Ms. White, her agent, said better representation would be achieved only when sample sizing moves beyond the traditional size 0 and when all shoots and fittings have mid- and plus-size options, meaning that models from those categories can be booked. If pieces didn't fit or look good, collections could be curated to meet a range of body shapes.
For now, mid- and plus-size models almost always have samples made for them: one-off creations that may make magazine covers or billboards but never go into production for women to buy. For Dr. Engeln of Northwestern, the absence of an industry infrastructure that allows larger models to succeed underscores the fact that brands are still committed to the idea that skinny models make them more money, even if the midsize movement on TikTok suggests a more far-reaching market.
"In media imagery, the link between money and thinness is undeniable," she said.
The primary motivation of nearly any fashion brand is making money, she added, "not building a more inclusive industry. If they're not using more than one midsize model, it's because the brand doesn't believe they will benefit from doing so."

In Paris last month, at the Chanel couture show, there was something about one model that set her apart from the others on the runway.
Strikingly beautiful, Jill Kortleve has almond-shaped eyes, dark bushy eyebrows and chiseled cheekbones. Since her runway debut for Alexander McQueen in 2018, she has appeared on many magazine covers; modeled in Versace, MaxMara and Jacquemus shows; and starred in advertising campaigns for Valentino Beauty and Fendi, to name but a few.
But what makes her an unusual star for the high-fashion industry is not the fact that she is 29, making her older than many of her peers, or that she is 5-foot-8, making her shorter than many of them too. It is the fact that Kortleve is a U.S. size 8 to 10 — or “midsize” — as the middle ground between petite and plus size is known. “Straight” size, or under a U.S. size 2, remains, overwhelmingly, the fashion industry norm.
Plus-size models, typically those above a U.S. size 12, have become better represented in high fashion. “Curve” models like Paloma Elsesser, Precious Lee and Ashley Graham have thriving careers.
For years, however, Kortleve has been one of the few midsize models of note. In January, she was the only midsize model cast by Chanel for its couture show. There were a handful of others at shows like Valentino, but last season Kortleve was the only midsize model to be cast by the marquee names on the couture calendar.

Full text: Fake fur at Schiaparelli, a menagerie at Chanel and an ode to Josephine Baker at Dior.
PARIS -- Ten a.m. on a frigid Monday morning, the first day of the couture shows, and Kylie Jenner was strutting through the marble halls of the Petit Palais trying to find her seat for Schiaparelli, shoehorned into spiky stilettos and a black velvet one-arm gown, a full-size tawny lion's head jutting from the side. It was as if Aslan had taken a break from Narnia and stuck his muzzle through a time-space continuum under her armpit. Or maybe it was Take Your Stuffed Toy to Work Day?
Nope: It was a dress so hot off the runway it hadn't even appeared on the runway yet -- though it was about to, along with a strapless faux-fur sheath with a snow leopard head jutting from the bust, its mouth open in mid-roar, and a big, hairy black silk and wool coat with a wolf's snout emerging from the shoulder.
Painstakingly sculpted from resin, painted by hand in the couture atelier, the faux animal heads were supposed to represent the vices of Dante's "Inferno" -- lust, pride, avarice -- according to the Schiaparelli designer Daniel Roseberry. He used the poem as something of a metaphor for his own experience with the pressure to create the new; to make everyone sit up in wonder.
To carve out a space in the attention economy. If social media and the red carpet are the fire of fame, Mr. Roseberry said, couture has become fashion's "gasoline": pour it on top and the conflagration gets ever hotter. It is "culture-making," he said. Or outrage stirring. These days, the two ideas can seem one and the same (file them under "provocation").
So the fake animal heads collided with real animal rights and Jenner/Kardashian mores, and for a time the explosion swallowed the digisphere whole. Were the looks promoting big game hunting, even though they didn't come from nature, or were they celebrating the beauty of the wild, as PETA declared, and facilitating "an anti-trophy-hunting dialogue"? Were they actually a metaphor for going after the rich -- hunting them, eating them, selling to them -- or were they a gimmick gone wrong?
Objectively, they were kind of silly, and the whole hoo-ha verged on the surreal (which makes sense for Schiaparelli, a house rooted in surrealism). But in their viral ubiquity, they also set the tone for the week, and the shows that unspooled thereafter.
Not just because Chanel also had an animal theme, courtesy of the artist Xavier Veilhan, who created a giant movable plywood bestiary for the set, in reference to Coco's favored menagerie. But because the drive to capture not just hearts and minds but eyeballs may explain the designer Virginie Viard's otherwise puzzling addition of circus-master bow ties and top hats to her flirty bouclé skirt suits; narrow, floor-sweeping coats; and drop-waist chiffon and feather frocks.
Also the upscaling of Giambattista Valli's rose-colored taffeta and tulle creations, which resembled nothing so much as sugar plum fairies on steroids. Maybe even Giorgio Armani's 77 iterations of harlequins.
Once upon a time the couture was a closed world -- that teeny tiny segment of fashion designed to showcase the art of the handmade, ruled by arcane requirements and priced so high it was accessible only by the very few: the apocryphal 200 global clients who were willing to pay the equivalent of an entry-level annual salary (and up) for a dress most of the world would never see. The price justified by artistry, know-how and the idea that what couture designers did trickled down into the wardrobes of everyone else.
Prepandemic, the party line was that couture was a social media-safe space, because it demanded the intimacy of personal experience. Now, however, powered by the gaze of the global crowd, it has begun to morph into something else. Darwin would understand.
Sure, there are still those who delight in the subtlety of a garment so mysteriously constructed it reeks of ineffable ease: the gold fil coupé Bar jackets and straight skirts Maria Grazia Chiuri offered up at Dior that somehow managed to retain their exacting shape with no interior boning; her crushed velvet bathrobe coats, gleaming with plush insouciance. In a preview, Ms. Chiuri said she had been inspired by the story of the former Dior client Josephine Baker, and her set was wrapped in paintings by the American artist Mickalene Thomas of 13 barrier-breaking women of color. It could have been heavy-handed, but instead the collection just riffed on a 1920s line, a smidgen of Jazz Age decadence woven into the cloth, the result sitting lightly on the body.
Such understatement has a power of its own, even in a moment of boldface names in pursuit of the visibly fabulous.
But it is the desire to be, said Jordan Roth, the theater impresario, collector and occasional model, "a singular piece of art on legs," that makes couture -- especially in January, as awards season gets underway -- the ultimate celebrity dress-hunting ground (and the ultimate place to hunt celebrities; see the crowds outside the show venues, which resemble nothing so much as crowds outside concert venues, shrieking and waving their smartphones). A popular game has become guess who will wear what to the Oscars/BAFTAs/Césars. Everyone can play.
At Dior, odds are the cowled sleeveless gowns fully embroidered in gleaming gold and silver thread, the jewel-tone velvets channeling a siren draped languidly over a piano, will be coming soon to a red carpet near you. Ditto Chanel's filigree white lace number with a bit of gold embroidery gleaming at the throat.
As for what the best actress nominee Michelle Yeoh, front row at Armani Privé, might choose from among all the diamonds and ruffs sprinkled over a collection that ranged from court jester to Picasso via trousers flapping an extra fabric fin at the side, caviar-bead cropped jackets and shimmering sequined gowns, there were some less -- well -- tricky, options.
But the danger in the current game of one-upmanship is that the clothes sometimes tip into the ridiculous. At Schiaparelli, Ms. Jenner (who also sat front row at Maison Margiela, where John Galliano delivered his patented brand of upcycled mayhem by mashing together tulle, tartan, fishnets, Mickey Mouse and Pendleton outerwear) and her lion head managed to overshadow not only Doja Cat, who arrived covered in 30,000 ruby crystals like some sort of émigré from an Avatar-themed Met Gala, but also the fact that there were parts of the collection that verged on the sublime.
The opening look's jacket, for example, made from hundreds of encrusted sequins tracing a perfume-bottle silhouette, over simple black pants. A pinstripe trouser suit that played with proportions so that jutting shoulders created the illusion of a Mr. Pearl-size waist, but without the rearranged organs. Breast plates made from abalone, precious stones and lemonwood marquetry that soared upward toward the throat and stretched the very definition of material.
Once all the smoke from the wild kingdom controversy had cleared, they were a reminder that sometimes, when you pour gasoline on a fire, you risk getting burned.

The Heart Motif Will Go On: [Style Desk]

Full text: Either way, you can't escape them.
Don't search for heart-shaped rings on the internet. It leads you to a series of failed celebrity romances and presumably to a trail of tears: Lady Gaga and Taylor Kinney, Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale, Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill.
As a design element, the heart is more like dots or stripes than it is a visual shorthand for romantic love. If you want romance, try lace or oysters or dead-stock midcentury Valentine's Day cards or inside jokes engraved on the back of a Swiss-made watch.
Hearts can feel bold and fresh: Think the boxy black Supreme shirt with red heart prints that Timothée Chalamet wore on a late-night talk show several years ago. (If that fact excites you, follow @readytimmywear on Instagram.) Another way to wear your heart on your sleeve would be a Nirvana "Heart-Shaped Box" allover print tee, recently going for four digits on Etsy.
To add just a little heart to your life, try a Deborah Pagani heart-shaped hair pin for Gucci Westman or a Blumarine belt with a heart-shaped buckle. Loewe has sunglasses with heart-shaped lenses, and like everything Jonathan Anderson designs, they're surreal enough that you can feel safe that no one will mistake you for paying homage to Kubrick's "Lolita." You might try to track down some of Chanel's chunkier costume jewelry with hearts. On the RealReal, you can find things like a red Chanel blouse with a black bow and a quilted heart from the Karl Lagerfeld years.
Even if you don't celebrate Valentine's Day, here are some hearts for the romantics and pragmatists alike.
Tiffany & Company
Hearts can lean a little bit cutesy, even skewing twee. If you'd rather die alone than give someone a candy heart, or are the kind of person who hates anything sweet (literal or figurative), try this jade pendant with an 18-karat gold mesh chain from the Elsa Peretti Open Heart collection for Tiffany. It's sexy and just a tad louche. The fresh green of the jade contrasts so well with the slinky 28-inch chain. Wear it with a beat-up vintage denim shirt buttoned so low even Bernard-Henri Lévy would blush. ( $ 4,900)
Alaïa
Remember when Rihanna wore that Yves Saint Laurent heart-shaped fur in 2016? Or maybe you bought the Erin Fetherston for Target heart-shaped bag in 2007? I was just doing some shopping reconnaissance and came across Alaïa's Le Cœur bag. It's small enough not to look gimmicky, but large enough to actually carry necessities. The shade of red is the right balance of cool and warm. Or you might consider a less obvious gold or blue one that comes on a gold chain. (from $ 1,170)
Yves Saint Laurent
No one understood the use of hearts as a design tool like Yves Saint Laurent, who drew them a little asymmetrical and off kilter. Re-See, the Paris-based designer resale site, has the best selection around, particularly the jewelry Robert Goossens designed for YSL. While you're browsing, there's a gold heart brooch with "Yves Saint Laurent" printed on it in script -- brooches are about to get big again -- that would look great on a man. But the coolest present would be a poster from 1989, said to be "from the private collection of one of Saint Laurent's most loyal collaborators." Bonus: It's framed. (2,100 euros, or about $ 2,300)
Stephen Dweck
Stellene Volandes, the editor in chief of Town & Country, who knows a lot about jewelry, said she was "a heart-jewelry skeptic for years" but is now drawn to them, pointing to lines like Foundrae and Briony Raymond. In that same vein, the jeweler Stephen Dweck, who used to design for Geoffrey Beene, makes the most decadent pair of earrings. You know when people ask you what your love language is? Here's mine: "Pink Tourmaline, Conch Shell and Diamond Earrings in 18K Gold." ( $ 28,865)
Paco Rabanne
A hood made of linked metal hearts looks like something you'd see in the armor section of the Met, but also like something the model Pat Cleveland would have worn to a club in the 1970s. (€650, or about $ 700)
Mondo Mondo
Hearts were big in the late 1980s, with bold, unapologetically big jewelry from Christian Lacroix or Chanel or Yves Saint Laurent. Natasha Ghosn, the designer of the Los Angeles jewelry-fragrance-candle line Mondo Mondo, may be the real heir to that aesthetic. So it's not surprising that she has a lot of heart motifs. This necklace looks like a piece of jewelry a scorned woman in a Jackie Collins novel would have ripped off her neck and thrown out a window after being betrayed by her man. It comes in silver and gold plate, but the silver feels a little less obvious and little more tender. ( $ 250)

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Judiciary Committee, responding to the bungled sale of Taylor Swift concert tickets, heard the company apologize and its critics trace the problem to the industry's lack of competition.
Live Nation Entertainment, the concert industry giant that owns Ticketmaster, came under withering attack during a Senate Judiciary hearing on Tuesday, with committee members from both parties criticizing it for the botched sale of tickets to Taylor Swift's latest tour and calling the company a monopoly that hinders competition and harms consumers.
Over nearly three hours, senators pilloried a top Live Nation executive, Joe Berchtold, over the handling of Ms. Swift's tickets last November and over longstanding allegations that the company badgers its competitors to win new business. Such bullying would be a violation of a Justice Department agreement that set conditions on the merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster in 2010.
"This is all the definition of monopoly," said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. "Live Nation is so powerful that it doesn't even need to exert pressure. It doesn't need to threaten. Because people just fall in line."
Some at the hearing went so far as to question whether the two companies, whose agreement with the Justice Department expires in 2025, should be broken up.
Mr. Berchtold, Live Nation's president and chief financial officer, acknowledged the problems with a presale for Ms. Swift's tour, and apologized to the singer and her fans. When those tickets went on sale, millions of people were turned away. Technical problems also caused tickets to disappear from the online baskets of customers -- whom Ticketmaster had approved through its Verified Fan system -- as they were trying to buy them.
Mr. Berchtold largely attributed Ticketmaster's failings to an assault from online bots: automated programs, run by scalpers, that seek to snatch up tickets before they ever make their way to consumers. That drew a largely skeptical response from the senators.
"This is unbelievable," Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, said, with more than a hint of anger in her voice. "Why is it," she added, "that you have not developed an algorithm to sort out what is a bot and what is a consumer?"
Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, was even more blunt. "The way your company handled the ticket sales with Ms. Swift," he said, "was a debacle."
The merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster united the world's most powerful concert promoter and the biggest ticketing platform, creating a colossus without equal in the multibillion-dollar live music business.
In 2019, the last full year unaffected by the Covid-19 pandemic for which Live Nation has reported data, the company put on more than 40,000 events around the world and sold 485 million tickets. It owns or otherwise controls more than 300 venues around the world, far more than any other player in the business.
In part because of its bulk and global reach, Live Nation has long been the target of complaints from competitors, who contend that the company's size, and its control of Ticketmaster, give it an unfair advantage.
Jerry Mickelson, a longtime independent concert promoter in Chicago, told the senators that a common frustration among the market's smaller players is that Live Nation can profit from concerts put on by rival promoters because it still makes money through its control of Ticketmaster. "Pepsi doesn't earn money from Coke," he said. "But our competitor, Live Nation, makes money from selling tickets to our concerts."
Objections to Live Nation's business have grown louder since 2019, when the Justice Department said that the company had "repeatedly violated" the terms of its regulatory agreement, called a consent decree.
Justice Department investigators said that Live Nation had threatened venues that it would withhold tours under the company's control if those venues did not sign deals with Ticketmaster, in violation of a key provision in the decree. Live Nation did not admit any wrongdoing, but in early 2020 the Justice Department extended the decree by five years.
Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, was among those at the hearing who raised the question of whether Live Nation's merger with Ticketmaster should be undone.
"If the Department of Justice establishes violations of the consent decree," he said, "then unwinding the merger ought to be on the table."
Mr. Berchtold pushed back against many of the accusations, saying that Live Nation does not threaten venues; that those venues hold a great deal of leverage in negotiating ticketing contracts; and that new entrants like SeatGeek, a rival ticketing platform, have kept Ticketmaster on its toes. According to various estimates cited by the senators, Ticketmaster controls the ticketing at 70 to 80 percent of major concert venues in the United States. Mr. Berchtold said Live Nation's estimate is 50 to 60 percent and he attributed its market share to the quality of its product.
"We believe ticketing has never been more competitive," he said.
At the hearing, called "That's the Ticket: Promoting Competition and Protecting Consumers in Live Entertainment," witnesses included other players in the concert business who described great difficulties competing against Live Nation.
Jack Groetzinger, the chief executive of SeatGeek, said that venues are afraid of losing Live Nation concert tours if they do not sign with Ticketmaster. He said that is an obstacle for smaller companies like his in winning new business -- though SeatGeek has been one of the more successful upstarts in ticketing in recent years, signing major clients like the Dallas Cowboys and Jujamcyn Theaters, one of the major Broadway theater owners.
The panel also included a musician, Clyde Lawrence, of a small New York band called Lawrence. Dressed in a black suit, and with a scruffy head of hair, he joked that he could only dream of the crushing ticket demand enjoyed by Ms. Swift. But he described frustrations in dealing with Live Nation, such as the backstage costs it charges musicians, and the opacity of ticket surcharges, for which his band gets nothing.
He described a typical show, where the face value of the ticket was $ 30, plus $ 12 in fees. Yet out of that $ 42 paid by the consumer, $ 30 was eaten up by the venue, Live Nation and Ticketmaster, and another $ 6 went to the band's touring expenses. "So that leaves us with $ 6 for an eight-piece band, pretax," he said, "and we also have to pay our own health insurance."
In his questioning, Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, honed in on a facet of Ticketmaster's business, the resale marketplace that exists seamlessly within its online ticket sales platform, "where you're forcing everyone in the resale market to come into your ecosystem."
"This is how monopolies work," Mr. Hawley added. "You leverage market power in one market to get market power in another market -- and it looks like you're doing that in, frankly, multiple markets."
Ms. Klobuchar, who called the hearing, said in a summation that some of the problems in ticketing, such as fighting bot traffic, could be dealt with through legislation. But she said that the larger question, of whether to take action against Live Nation as a monopoly, was best handled by the Justice Department. The near-unanimous criticism from lawmakers on Tuesday may put pressure on the Justice Department to act.
The most remarkable aspect of the hearing may have been the display of consensus by a panel often split along partisan lines. Mr. Blumenthal summed that up with a mocking salute to Mr. Berchtold.
"I want to congratulate and thank you for an absolutely stunning achievement," he said. "You have brought together Republicans and Democrats in an absolutely unified cause."

In New Zealand, Same Policies Come in New Style: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Hipkins, who was sworn in on Wednesday, has nine months to persuade voters who cooled on Jacinda Ardern's government that he's a fresh alternative.
Days after Jacinda Ardern's surprise resignation as New Zealand's prime minister, her soon-to-be-successor, Chris Hipkins, was trying to put distance between himself and Ms. Ardern in a flurry of interviews.
"I supported Jacinda Ardern as our prime minister, I think she did an amazing job," he told one television journalist on Monday. "But look: We're different people, and we'll have a different style."
Mr. Hipkins, 44, who was sworn in as prime minister on Wednesday, now has nine months to persuade voters who cooled on Ms. Ardern's leadership that he offers a fresh alternative before a general election in October.
The problem? Mr. Hipkins and Ms. Ardern may have different styles, but when it comes to policy, their similarities are far more pronounced.
"It is very much a government going on the same track as it was before, but with a different face," said Bernard Hickey, a political commentator based in Auckland.
Christopher Luxon, who is almost certain to be Mr. Hipkins's opponent in the Oct. 14 election, has made the same point. "There's no change, it's just more of the same -- that's because it is essentially the same team," Mr. Luxon, the leader of the center-right National Party, said on Sunday.
Mr. Hipkins was one of the architects of the Ardern government's key policies, along with Ms. Ardern herself and her deputy, Grant Robertson, who will remain as finance minister under Mr. Hipkins. The three have been close for years; they were advisers to Helen Clark, the former Labour Party prime minister, and became members of Parliament at the same time, in 2008. Mr. Hickey described their shared political outlook: "Fiscal conservatives, broadly social liberals, very aware of the political center."
In terms of style, Mr. Hipkins does differ from Ms. Ardern. He is scrappier and more combative, with sharper debating instincts.
He also lacks the megawatt charisma that made Ms. Ardern an international political star. Ms. Ardern has graced the pages of Vogue; Mr. Hipkins, by contrast, has the kind of aesthetic that New Zealanders call "daggy" (think wraparound sunglasses and a Diet Coke in hand).
He often refers to himself as "a boy from the Hutt," short for the Hutt Valley, the unfashionable industrial area where he grew up. The father of two children, who he has said will play no part in his political life -- another contrast with Ms. Ardern, who brought her daughter to the United Nations -- Mr. Hopkins presents himself as a likable everyman.
That attitude may resonate with some New Zealanders, especially outside urban centers, Mr. Hickey said.
"Chris Hipkins will be able to present himself as a different flavor, simply because of that Hutt background," he said. Even his occasional gaffes -- during a Covid lockdown, he once famously said that New Zealanders wanted to "spread their legs," when he meant "stretch" -- may benefit him, Mr. Hickey added.
"There's a self-deprecating 'look at me, I'm a klutz' thing about people in public life in New Zealand," he said, "which is designed to present someone as just like everyone else, not better than their peers, and someone that can be trusted and worked with."
Variously responsible for education, health, New Zealand's Covid-19 response and policing, Mr. Hipkins has built a reputation as a Mr. Fix-It, a practical figure capable of hard work, said Grant Duncan, a lecturer at Massey University in Auckland.
"He gets stuck in, and he fixes problems," he said. "I think New Zealand is pretty familiar with him by now."
There has been speculation that Mr. Hipkins might edge away from Ardern policies and approaches that, to many voters on the right, have become symbols of left-wing government overreach -- like "co-governance," which refers to involving Indigenous New Zealanders in policy decisions. Already, commentators have noted Mr. Hipkins's preference for calling the country New Zealand, as opposed to Aotearoa, the Maori name favored by Ms. Ardern.
Echoing comments made by Ms. Ardern last year, Mr. Hipkins has promised to make pocketbook concerns his priority. "Our focus will be on the right now, on the bread-and-butter issues that people care about," he said on Sunday. "Some people, many people are hurting at the moment, and I want them to know that we are on their side."
But problems like inflation, a housing crisis and significant child poverty are likely to be daunting. "There is no answer, because most of the inflation that we're seeing in the country is because of what's happening around the world," said Shamubeel Eaqub, an economist based in Auckland. "There is no New Zealand response to global inflation."
Some of Mr. Hipkins's decisions under Ms. Ardern's leadership may also haunt him, said Dr. Duncan, the Massey University lecturer.
As education minister, Mr. Hipkins oversaw a mostly unsuccessful merger of technical colleges that led to some high-profile resignations. Financial difficulties in higher education continue. He and his ministry have been criticized for his response to high rates of truancy in New Zealand and failing to deliver on a raft of promises for school leavers.
But he is better known for his daily news conferences during the first two years of the coronavirus pandemic, and the hardships once caused by New Zealand's stringent Covid policies are what many people associate him with.
Hence his attempt to put Ms. Ardern's government behind him, and to present himself as a fresh face, as he tries to appeal to the centrist, middle-class New Zealanders who have migrated from Labour to National.
"His basic mission at the moment -- possibly Mission Impossible -- is to turn that tide around," Dr. Duncan said.
On Tuesday, Ms. Ardern's last full day in office -- after which she would become a mere backbench Labour lawmaker until she resigns from politics altogether in April -- she made it clear that she would help Mr. Hipkins keep his distance.
"You won't find me commentating on domestic politics," she said in the village of Ratana, where she and Mr. Hipkins spoke at a gathering of politicians and Maori elders. "I've had my time, and it's now for the new team."

Full text: She collaborated on the melodies for signature commercials that sang the praises of McDonald's, Coca-Cola and other brands.
Ginny Redington Dawes, a songwriter whose compositions included memorable advertising jingles like the chipper McDonald's declaration "You, You're the One" and Coca-Cola's boast that "Coke Is It," died on Dec. 31 in Manhattan. She was 77.
Her companion and only immediate survivor, James McCullar, said the cause was complications of hepatic cirrhosis.
Ms. Dawes never became well known herself, but she helped maintain or boost the popularity of the products she promoted. And she insinuated infectious tunes into the nation's repertoire that Americans whistled and hummed as much as the songs played on Top 40 radio.
She hooked listeners with melodically and rhythmically catchy jingles that accompanied slogans for everything from Tide detergent to Kit Kat candy bars, to Johnson's baby powder and to Hartz's tick and flea-fighting pet collars.
"When I've got a really great lyric," she told Charles Osgood of CBS in a 1977 television interview, "I put a very simple melody to it."
Ms. Dawes started writing the music and lyrics for commercials in 1975 after the firm of Sidney E. Woloshin -- who composed the original McDonald's "You Deserve a Break Today" jingle in 1971 -- was commissioned to do one for the chain's new "You, You're the One" advertising campaign.
Mr. Woloshin invited about 20 jingle writers to submit proposals. Ms. Dawes produced the winning tune. Adopted by the ad agency Needham, Harper & Steers, it was suddenly everywhere.
In 1979, she married a jingle-writing competitor, Thomas W. Dawes, whose credits included Alka-Seltzer's "Plop, Plop, Fizz, Fizz" and "7Up, the Uncola."
They later collaborated on the music for, among other campaigns, American Airlines' "Something Special in the Air" and the familiar "Coke Is It." Mr. Dawes died in 2007.
The jingle that underscored Coke's claim to be "It," introduced in 1982, was described as a "piece of dynamite" by John F. Bergin, the worldwide director of the Coke account at the McCann-Erickson agency.
While David Ogilvy, a founder of the Ogilvy & Mather agency, was credited with the credo "If you don't have anything to say, sing it," Mr. Bergin argued that the musical accompaniment to the Coke commercial was anything but an afterthought. If soda drinkers paused to parse the ambiguity of what "It" was, the tune was intended to define the term and embellish it.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.] "It's like a football fight song," Mr. Bergin told The New York Times. "Usually you get a languid ballad. We were looking for a big, bold sound, and a big, bold statement. This isn't an ipsy-pipsy drink, and the music says that loud and clear."
The song, composed by Ms. Dawes and arranged by her husband, was one of 18 jingles and 36 proposed slogans presented to Coca-Cola executives to succeed "Have a Coke and a Smile."
The music and copy were tested separately in consumer focus groups and individual interviews until the agency and company reached a consensus that "Coke is it" was, indeed, it.
Ms. Dawes also wrote pop songs, including "Hurtin' Song," recorded by Eddy Arnold, and "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" (written with Rose Marie McCoy), recorded by Sarah Vaughan.
Ms. Dawes began her musical career as a singer, to glowing reviews.
When she appeared in 1975 at the Coriander, a restaurant on Manhattan's Upper East Side, John S. Wilson of The Times called her a "startling performer" who sang "in a deep, strong, beautifully controlled voice that is filled with vivid colors, as she moves from low, sexy passages to an open, lusty shout."

Virginia Mary Redington was born on May 13, 1945, in Brooklyn and raised in the Bay Ridge section of the borough. Her father, Joseph, was a naval architect. Her mother, May (O'Brien) Redington, was a teacher.
Virginia attended Fontbonne Hall Academy in Brooklyn and graduated from St. Josephs College, also in Brooklyn, with a degree in English in 1966.
She and Mr. Dawes -- a founder of the folk-pop group the Cyrkle, best known for its 1966 hit single "Red Rubber Ball," written by Paul Simon and Bruce Woodley of the Seekers -- married in 1979 and, merging their talents, formed TwinStar Music to produce jingles
The couple also wrote the book, music and lyrics for "The Talk of the Town," a show about the fabled literary round table at the Algonquin Hotel, whose members included Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley and George S. Kaufman. First produced in 2004, it ran nearly two years at the Bank Street Theater before it moved as a cabaret show to the Algonquin Hotel's Oak Room.
Reviewing the show for Bloomberg News, John Simon wrote that its music and wit matched "the infectious energy and sophistication of the real-life luminaries it is based on."
Ms. Dawes was also a collector of antique jewelry and the author, with her husband (who took the photographs) and others, of several books on the subject, including "The Bakelite Jewelry Book" (1988), with Corinne Davidov, and "Georgian Jewellery 1714-1830" (2007), with Ms. Dawes's fellow collector Olivia Collings.

Covid-Response Minister Is Set to Succeed Ardern: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Mr. Hipkins, a household name in New Zealand for his role overseeing the country's response to the pandemic, was nominated to succeed Jacinda Ardern as leader of the governing Labour Party.
Chris Hipkins, who has been serving as New Zealand's education and policing minister, is set to become the country's new prime minister next month after he was the only member of the governing Labour Party to be nominated for the party leadership post.
Members of the Labour caucus will meet on Sunday in the New Zealand city of Napier, where they are currently at their summer retreat, to endorse the nomination and confirm Mr. Hipkins as their party's new leader. At least 10 percent of the caucus must vote for Mr. Hipkins to confirm him.
His nomination comes after the surprise resignation on Thursday of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who had become a global liberal icon during her tenure.
"I believe that leading a country is the most privileged job anyone could ever have, but also one of the more challenging," Ms. Ardern said at the news conference announcing her decision. "You cannot and should not do it unless you have a full tank."
Ms. Ardern has said she will leave her post "no later" than Feb. 7, giving the party about two weeks to complete the transition.
A clear front-runner from the moment Ms. Ardern revealed her decision to step down, Mr. Hipkins promised a seamless leadership transition without the infighting and back-alley machinations common to many political parties.
"We will select a new leader that the party will then unite behind," he said, after Ms. Ardern's resignation. "Leadership contests don't have to be like the Hunger Games."
Mr. Hipkins, nicknamed Chippy, became a household name in New Zealand during his daily televised briefings throughout the first two years of the coronavirus pandemic.
As first as the health minister and then as the minister for the Covid-19 response, Mr. Hipkins, 44, became the face of -- and often the driving force of the policies behind -- the country's stringent, but widely applauded approach to the virus.
The country's policies resulted in few deaths but included some of the world's most extensive restrictions in the first months of the pandemic -- before the rules were all removed when the virus had been eradicated from the country, allowing New Zealanders to lead largely normal lives for most of the pandemic.
But as the Labour Party's next leader, he will face a number of major challenges when the country goes to the polls on Oct. 14.
In a clash of two Chrises, Mr. Hipkins will go head-to-head against Christopher Luxon, the leader of the National Party and the former chief executive of New Zealand's national airline, Air New Zealand.
Voters, facing the same pocketbook strains as people in many other parts of the world, are looking for solutions to biting inflation, an ongoing housing crisis and other entrenched social problems such as child poverty and crime. Polling suggests many believe the governing party has not provided the policy answers to those problems, with 38 percent favoring the center-right National Party compared with Labour's 33 percent, as of last month.
Mr. Hipkins may also struggle to get beyond his association with pandemic policy, potentially a double-edged sword with voters eager to put the worst of the last three years behind them.
The country's rigorous restrictions and vaccine mandates were initially popular with most New Zealanders. But as the rest of the world opened up and New Zealand's borders remained shut, resentment began to grow, spurring a backlash and resulting in a crowd of protesters camping outside Parliament's grounds in Wellington for more than three weeks.
Even as her party slumped in the polls, Ms. Ardern had retained a certain star power that her successor may struggle to match. Instead, Mr. Hipkins, who has been a lawmaker since 2008, may bring to the campaign a reputation as a champion debater and an experienced policymaker, as well as a face familiar to most in the country.
Certain idiosyncrasies and odd moments -- including a well-known fondness for Diet Coke; a time when he posed with a birthday cake made entirely of sausage rolls; and, ahead of a news conference held in a nature reserve, the surprise appearance of his mother, who apologized for his lateness -- have been memorialized in countless internet jokes, earning him the unofficial title of "minister for memes."
In a news conference on Saturday, Mr. Hipkins, who has cultivated a political brand of being approachable and down to earth, said that he was "humbled and honored" to assume the party's leadership and that he was "incredibly optimistic" about New Zealand's future.
He added: "I'm a human being. I'll make the odd mistake from time to time, I try and own the mistakes that I make. I don't pretend to be someone that I'm not. I've never done that in the past. And I don't intend to start doing it."
A "boy from the Hutt," as he described himself in the news conference, Mr. Hipkins grew up in the industrial and unglamorous Hutt Valley north of Wellington, the New Zealand capital.
He majored in politics and criminology at Victoria University of Wellington, where he was twice elected student body president. As a first-year student in 1997, he was arrested, strip-searched and detained overnight for protesting a higher education reform bill that he later said would "turn academic entities into corporate entities, treat students as customers."
The government in 2009 apologized to and compensated the protesters.
In his first speech in Parliament as a newly elected member in 2008, Mr. Hipkins cited family, community spirit and state support as chief priorities, and called for reform to New Zealand's welfare system, which he said should help those "at the bottom" to scale "the ladder of opportunity."
"The needs of the competitive free market are balanced by the need for the government to set a few boundaries and ensure that the most vulnerable are protected," he said.

At the Golden Globes, a Night of Statement-Making: [Style Desk]

Full text: The awards show returned, and so did major dressing up.
So the Golden Globes returned, two years after disappearing from our screens, first because of a pandemic-induced lockdown and then because of scandal -- financial, ethical and racial. And with their disappearance went the first major red carpet of that phenomenon otherwise known as the Extended Awards Season Fashion Show.
Before the event, speculation was rife: Would stars actually show up for the tarnished Hollywood Foreign Press Association? And if they did, would they seek to play down their connection with the evening's awards by dressing down? Would they stay away from eye-catching ensembles, in favor of the forgettably banal and the bland?
As if. Globes night turned out to be a night of statement-making, onstage and on the red carpet. Not so much of the marketing or branding kind, but rather of the personal kind. And it was the more interesting for it.
Jerrod Carmichael, the host, set the tone with an opening monologue that addressed the Globes' historical lack of diversity without pulling any punches and went on from there -- with a matching set of six (count 'em) outfit changes that included two skinny black velvet suits (the first by Armani); a symphony of pinks; one white tuxedo with a sheer turtleneck and pearl necklace; and a Bode beaded tunic. It may be a record for number of award show looks worn by a single host. If some fashion brand doesn't sign him up immediately, it'll be the biggest surprise of the night.
Still, go big or go home seemed to be the general theme. Rihanna, making her first major post-baby event appearance, swaddled herself in a black velvet Schiaparelli bustier dress and an enormous shoulder-swallowing sculpted velvet stole, plus velvet opera gloves and Cartier diamonds.
Angela Bassett played a silver superhero in Pamela Rolland sequins. Laverne Cox channeled Marilyn Monroe in a blond bob and vintage Galliano gown. And Jessica Chastain got caught in a gossamer beaded Oscar de la Renta spiderweb -- with a matching mask. She was one of the few attendees to nod to the continued reality of Covid.
Royalty was a trend, represented in a plethora of red (Lily James in a bandeau top from which was suspended acres of swagged Versace skirting and Billy Porter in a cardinal velvet Christian Siriano coatdress with a sweeping train) and purple (Selena Gomez in Valentino and Sheryl Lee Ralph in glimmering Aliétte). This was probably not surprising given the recently unavoidable nature of the subject thanks to Prince Harry's memoir.
Also pink, courtesy of Seth Rogen in salmon Dior Men and Margot Robbie in powder puff Chanel. (Rumors of her separation from the brand appear to be highly exaggerated.) And overblown rosettes on lapels, as represented by Eddie Redmayne's chocolate Valentino, Diego Calva's forest green Gucci and Emma D'Arcy's oversize Acne Studios satin tux, skirt and trousers, chosen because, they said, "nothing says nonbinary like wearing both a skirt and trousers."
There was a lot of speaking-in-clothes going on. Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, in draped sapphire Balmain, told E! that her dress was "giving water butterfly." Michelle Williams, in cascading tiers of Gucci ruffles, looked like sea coral, wafting in the waves. And Jenny Slate, in leaf green Rodarte with a bloom at the throat, said she wanted to look "like a woman who's about to turn into a magical plant." Why not? It's the beginning of the year. Anything could happen.
Donald Glover said he was going for comfort, and the chance to get "mildly drunk," with his white silk YSL pajama-and-robe set under his tux, possibly the perfect combination of working-from-home dressing meets black tie. You can go from the ballroom to the bedroom in one easy step.
Indeed, it was but one of a variety of contemporary twists on ye olde tux, as modeled most successfully by Jean Smart in an elegant, sharp-shouldered tuxedo dress with an actual twist at the waist, and Hannah Einbinder in a strapless black Carolina Herrera tea dress with a white bow at the bodice.
She looked as if she could move, as did Letitia Wright, in a simple Prada trompe l'oeil silk column dress, deliberately crumpled and splotched with a rough-cut slash at the leg that was an ode of sorts to the elegance of imperfection. Like the night itself, it was a reminder that when it comes to our flaws, it's how you deal with them that matters.

Danone Sued Over Its Plastic Use Under a Landmark Law: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Environmental groups are relying on a law in France requiring large companies to address their environmental footprint.
PARIS -- Danone, the French dairy giant, is being taken to court by three environmental groups who say it has failed to reduce its plastic footprint sufficiently, in a lawsuit challenging corporate social responsibility in the face of the climate crisis.
The groups accuse Danone -- one of the world's top 10 plastic polluters, according to a recent study -- of "failing to live up to its duties" under a groundbreaking French law that requires large companies to address their environmental impact and has opened ways to sue them should they fail to do so.
"Danone is trudging ahead without a serious plan to deal with plastics, despite clear concern from climate and health experts and consumers, and a legal obligation to face up to the issue," Rosa Pritchard, a lawyer for ClientEarth, one of the groups, said in a statement on Monday.
A spokeswoman for Danone said the company "strongly" refutes the accusation, adding that it was taking action to "reduce the use of plastic, develop reuse, reinforce collection and recycling channels, and develop alternative materials."
The lawsuit is likely to put the spotlight on the explosive growth of plastics pollution, which scientists say is affecting air and water quality, global warming, as well as human and animal life. The issue is so pressing that the United Nations last year agreed to begin writing a treaty designed to curb plastics production.
But Monday's announcement also spoke to a broader trend in environmental activism, with advocacy groups increasingly suing governments and companies in an effort to bridge the gap between their climate promises and their actual record.
Adam Weiss, ClientEarth program director for Europe, said some could see France's statute as toothless because of its vague requirements.
But, he added, "the teeth are in the lawsuits."
By suing Danone, ClientEarth and the two other groups, Surfrider Europe and Zero Waste France, are hoping to shed light on what many scientists say is a global plastic crisis whose potentially devastating effects have yet to be fully understood.
Throughout their life cycle, plastics, which are manufactured from fossil fuels, release air pollutants, harm human health and kill marine life. In 2015, they were responsible for 4.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, one recent study found, more than all of the world's airplanes combined.
Figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show that, over the past seven decades, plastics production has soared from two million metric tons (there are about 2,200 pounds per metric ton) to more than 400 million -- and is expected to almost triple by 2060.
Danone alone used more than 750,000 metric tons of plastic -- about 74 times the weight of the Eiffel Tower -- in water bottles , yogurt containers and other packaging in 2021, according to its 2021 financial report.
The company said that it reduced its plastic consumption by 12 percent from 2018 to 2021, and that it has committed to use only reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025. But Danone is not on track to reach that target, according to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which set up a voluntary program with the United Nations for big companies to address plastic pollution.
An investigation last year by the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle also highlighted Danone's shortcomings when it comes to recycled plastics.
Environmental groups also say that recycling has not proved effective at the scale necessary: Only 9 percent of all plastics ever made have been recycled, according to the United Nations, with most of the rest ending up in landfills and dumps.
"We're not going to recycle our way out of this," Mr. Weiss of ClientEarth said.
He added that plastics were too critical to Danone's business model for "voluntary mechanisms" to be effective. "We need the power of law," he said.
To sue Danone, the environmental groups have relied on the so-called duty of vigilance law, a groundbreaking piece of legislation that France passed in 2017. It requires large companies to take effective measures to identify and prevent human rights violations and environmental damages throughout their chain of activity.
Impetus for the law came from the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013, in which the collapse of a clothing factory killed more than 1,100 people in Bangladesh. Labels from famous brands were found in the rubble, casting a harsh light on the garment industry and prompting politicians and rights groups around the world to press for more corporate responsibility.
The French duty of vigilance law, the first of its kind in Europe, has since inspired similar legislation in Germany and the Netherlands, as well as a proposed European Union directive.
There is nothing like a duty of vigilance law in the United States. The Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act, which would require plastic producers to finance waste and recycling programs, and ban single-use plastic bags and the exporting of plastic waste to developing countries, is currently in committee.
However, environmental organizations have increasingly sued big plastic polluters like Coca-Cola over the past few years using mostly state-level consumer protection laws, alleging that the companies' use of single-use plastic contradicts advertising statements that they are committed to recycling and the environment.
In France, academics and rights groups say, many companies have responded to the law only by listing vague measures or some that already existed before the new obligations.
"It's often about streamlining existing practices," said Pauline Barraud de Lagerie, a sociologist at University Paris Dauphine who published a book on corporate responsibility. She added that by suing companies, "N.G.O.s are trying to somehow bring back an obligation of result."
So far, around 15 legal cases based on the French law have been reported. Half of them have gone to court and are still awaiting judgment, which could take years.
"We're making up for the government's lack of political will," said Sandra Cossart, the head of Sherpa, a group involved in four legal cases, pointing to what she described as a law lacking teeth.
The environmental groups said in their statement that Danone's 2021 vigilance plan "is completely silent on plastics." They are calling for judges in a Paris civil court to force the company to release a new plan within six months that would include a phaseout of plastics. Should the company fail to meet that deadline, they are demanding damages of 100,000 euros ( $ 108,000) per day of delay.
In September, the groups had issued formal notices to eight other major food companies accusing them of inadequate due diligence plans. ClientEarth said it had received satisfactory responses from companies such as the grocery chain Carrefour and Nestlé, which promised to step up their efforts, but not from Danone.
The lawsuit is part of a wider trend of climate litigation that has gained momentum in recent years, expanding the climate fight beyond traditional demonstrations and civil disobedience initiatives.
The number of climate change lawsuits globally has more than doubled from 2017 to 2022, from about 900 to more than 2,000 ongoing or concluded cases, according to data from the Grantham Research Institute and the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.
Catherine Higham, a researcher at the Grantham institute, said that most cases have been brought against governments, but that increasingly advocacy groups have turned their sights on corporations.
Mr. Weiss of ClientEarth said his group had been struggling to navigate corporate laws "designed to protect investors and companies" in order to press them to better address environmental issues.
"Now, we have a law designed to make companies take action for the environment," he said. "That's a step change."

Jump to: Tricky Clues | Today's Theme
MONDAY PUZZLE -- I love a good puzzle collaboration, and this one from Andrea Carla Michaels, who has written 80 New York Times Crossword puzzles, and Kevin Christian, who has written 15, is a perfect example of top-notch teamwork.
I spoke with Tracy Bennett, an associate puzzle editor, about this offering from Ms. Michaels and Mr. Christian, a team of veteran constructors. She commented on their strengths as constructors, observing that "Andrea and Kevin are both experts in devising simple, elegant Monday themes built around lively phrases." In this puzzle, she said, "they've pooled their resources."
Ms. Michaels confirmed that interpretation of their collaboration, explaining in her notes that Mr. Christian developed the theme and the grid, while she contributed the Monday-level clues and tweaked the grid. Let's take a look at Mr. Christian's theme and then unpack a few of Ms. Michaels's clues.
Today's Theme
This puzzle features five theme entries in the long Across positions. The revealer, at 55D, asks solvers to identify the "'Highway to Hell' rock group ... or a hint to electrical switches found in 16-, 23-, 36-, 44- and 57-Across." That rock group, and the electrical switches, are AC/DC -- these sets of two letters are found, in that order, in each of the identified entries.
The AC/DC theme entries are:
16A. SACRED COW ("Concept that can't be criticized or questioned, metaphorically")
23A. CRACKED CRAB ("Seafood often served with picks")
36A. BACKGROUND CHECK ("Pre-employment investigation")
44A. JACK AND COKE ("Cocktail named for two iconic beverage brands")
57A. ACTED COOL ("Behaved in a laid-back way")
I asked Ms. Bennett what stood out to her about this theme. She said: "As a solver, once you get to the revealer, you can go back to the four longest answers and find the pattern. Though many people happily enjoy puzzles without noticing themes, finding the theme can add to the specialness and memorability of a puzzle and can enhance the experience of solving."
I completely agree with this assessment. I was unable to identify the AC/DC theme as I was solving (I thought perhaps the ACK string in 23A, 36A and 44A might have something to do with it, but that's as far as I got). But when I got the revealer, I enjoyed the "aha!" moment of revisiting the theme entries and finding the embedded AC/DC.
All of the theme entries do a great job of hiding the "DC" by splitting it across two words, although ACTED COOL feels like an outlier -- perhaps because it is a verb? But there's no denying that all four are interesting, in-the-language phrases that make up a great theme set.
Tricky(ish!) Clues
Because this is a Monday, few of the clues were what I'd call "tricky." So instead, here are some I wanted to comment on.
9A. "How revenge (or pizza for breakfast) is best served" is a fantastic clue for COLD. I bet this clue stirs up some controversy; I, for one, fully agree that pizza for breakfast should be served COLD.
25A. "Dab, as with a paper towel" is BLOT. Because this is the day for controversial pizza takes, I want to plant a flag firmly in the "Please don't BLOT the grease off your pizza!" camp.
41A. "Music Mann?" is a play on the musical "The Music Man," but instead of the Broadway show, it refers to the singer AIMEE Mann.
49D. I enjoy clues that take the form "word before" or "words with." Here, the "Word before space or limits" is OUTER, as in OUTER space or OUTER limits.
Constructor Notes
Kevin Christian: It's always a pleasure to collaborate with Andrea. She's the best Monday constructor out there, in my opinion.
AC/DC was a significant part of the soundtrack of my teenage years. This puzzle is dedicated to their original lead singer, Bon Scott, who died in 1980.
Andrea Carla Michaels: Some collaborations are equal back and forth, ironing out themes, grid layout, fill and cluing. Others, one might do most of the theme (my preferred role), the other most of the grid. Today's puzzle was 90 percent Kevin: his idea, his grid. I merely offered advice from the sidelines, smoothed out a section or two and clued it for Monday difficulty.
My biggest contribution was ignored all around! I wanted circles, not just to ease the solve, but to highlight how brilliantly Kevin found phrases that did not just contain the letters A, C, D, C in that order (no mean feat) but phrases that paired them together!
I was assured by Kevin (and every editor I pleaded with) that solvers would be able to pick up on that construction subtlety by the revealer alone. We shall see!
I look forward to many future collaborations between Kevin and me, or should I say, AC/KC?

F.T.C. Seeks to Ban Noncompete Deals: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A sweeping proposal by the Federal Trade Commission would block companies from limiting their employees' ability to work for a rival.
In a far-reaching move that could raise wages and increase competition among businesses, the Federal Trade Commission on Thursday unveiled a rule that would block companies from limiting their employees' ability to work for a rival.
The proposed rule would ban provisions of labor contracts known as noncompete agreements, which prevent workers from leaving for a competitor or starting a competing business for months or years after their employment, often within a certain geographic area. The agreements have applied to workers as varied as sandwich makers, hairstylists, doctors and software engineers.
Studies show that noncompetes, which appear to directly affect roughly 20 percent to 45 percent of U.S. workers in the private sector, hold down pay because job switching is one of the more reliable ways of securing a raise. Many economists believe they help explain why pay for middle-income workers has stagnated in recent decades.
Other studies show that noncompetes protect established companies from start-ups, reducing competition within industries. The arrangements may also harm productivity by making it hard for companies to hire workers who best fit their needs.
The F.T.C. proposal is the latest in a series of aggressive and sometimes unorthodox moves to rein in the power of large companies under the agency's chair, Lina Khan.
President Biden hailed the proposal on Thursday, saying that noncompete clauses "are designed simply to lower people's wages."
"These agreements block millions of retail workers, construction workers and other working folks from taking a better job, getting better pay and benefits, in the same field," he said at a cabinet meeting.
The public will be allowed to submit comments on the proposal for 60 days, at which point the agency will move to make it final. An F.T.C. document said the rule would take effect 180 days after the final version was published, but experts said it could face legal challenges.
The agency estimated that the rule could increase wages by nearly $ 300 billion a year across the economy. Evan Starr, an economist at the University of Maryland who has studied noncompetes, said that was a plausible wage increase after their elimination.
Dr. Starr said noncompetes appeared to lower wages both for workers directly covered by them and for other workers, partly by making the hiring process more costly for employers, who must spend time figuring out whom they can hire and whom they can't.
He pointed to research showing that wages tended to be higher in states that restrict noncompetes. One study found that wages for newly hired tech workers in Hawaii increased by about 4 percent after the state banned noncompetes for those workers. In Oregon, where new noncompetes became unenforceable for low-wage workers in 2008, the change appeared to raise the wages of hourly workers by 2 percent to 3 percent.
Although noncompetes appear to be more common among more highly paid and more educated workers, many companies have used them for low-wage hourly workers and even interns.
About half of states significantly constrain the use of noncompetes, and a small number have deemed them largely unenforceable, including California.
But even in such states, companies often include noncompetes in employment contracts, and many workers in these states report turning down job offers partly as a result of the provisions, suggesting that these state regulations may have limited effects. Many workers in those states are not necessarily aware that the provisions are unenforceable, experts say.
"Research shows that employers' use of noncompetes to restrict workers' mobility significantly suppresses workers' wages -- even for those not subject to noncompetes, or subject to noncompetes that are unenforceable under state law," Elizabeth Wilkins, the director of the F.T.C.'s office of policy planning, said in a statement.
The commission's proposal appears to address this issue by requiring employers to withdraw existing noncompetes and to inform workers that they no longer apply. The proposal would also make it illegal for an employer to enter into a noncompete with a worker or to try to do so, or to suggest that a worker is bound by a noncompete when he or she is not.
The proposal covers not just employees but also independent contractors, interns, volunteers and other workers.
Defenders of noncompetes argue that employees are free to turn down a job if they want to preserve their ability to join another company, or that they can bargain for higher pay in return for accepting the restriction. Proponents also argue that noncompetes make employers more likely to invest in training and to share sensitive information with workers, which they might withhold if they feared that a worker might quickly leave.
A ban "ignores the fact that, when appropriately used, noncompete agreements are an important tool in fostering innovation," Sean Heather, a senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.
At least one study has found that greater enforcement of noncompetes leads to an increase in job creation by start-ups, though some of its conclusions are at odds with other research.
Dr. Starr said that noncompetes did appear to encourage businesses to invest more in training, but that there was little evidence that most employees entered into them voluntarily or that they were able to bargain over them. One study found that only 10 percent of workers sought to bargain for concessions in return for signing a noncompete. About one-third became aware of the noncompete only after accepting a job offer.
Michael R. Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said that while there were good reasons to scale back noncompetes for lower-wage workers, the rationale was less clear for better-paid workers with specialized knowledge or skills.
"If your job is to make minor tweaks to the formula for Coca-Cola and you're one of 25 people on earth who knows the formula," Dr. Strain said, speaking hypothetically, "it makes total sense that Coca-Cola might say, 'We don't want you to go work for Pepsi."'
He said that it might be possible to satisfy an employer's concerns with a less blunt tool, like a nondisclosure agreement, but that the evidence for this was lacking.
In a video call with reporters on Wednesday, Ms. Khan said she believed the F.T.C. had clear authority to issue the rule, noting that federal law empowers the agency to prohibit "unfair methods of competition."
But Kristen Limarzi, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who previously served as a senior official in the antitrust division of the Justice Department, said she believed such a rule could be vulnerable to a legal challenge. Opponents would probably argue that the relevant federal statute is too vague to guide the agency in putting forth a rule banning noncompetes, she said, and that the evidence the agency has on their effects is still too limited to support a rule.
At the helm of the F.T.C. since last year, Ms. Khan has tried to use the agency's authority in untested ways to rein in the power and influence of corporate giants. In doing so, she and her allies hope to reverse a turn in recent decades toward more conservative antitrust law -- a shift that they say enabled runaway concentration, limited options for consumers and squeezed small businesses.
Ms. Khan has brought lawsuits in recent months to block Meta, Facebook's parent company, from buying a virtual reality start-up and Microsoft from buying the video game publisher Activision Blizzard. Both cases employ less common legal arguments that are likely to face heavy scrutiny from courts. But Ms. Khan has indicated she is willing to lose cases if the agency ends up taking more risks.
Ms. Khan and her counterpart at the Justice Department's antitrust division, Jonathan Kanter, have also said they want to increase the focus of the nation's antitrust agencies on empowering workers. Last year, the Justice Department successfully blocked Penguin Random House from buying Simon & Schuster using the argument that the deal would lower compensation for authors.
One question looming over the discussion of noncompetes is what effect banning them may have on prices during a period of high inflation, given that limiting noncompetes tends to raise wages.
But the experience of the past two years, when rates of quitting and job-hopping have been unusually high, suggests that noncompetes may not currently be as big an obstacle to worker mobility as they have traditionally been. Partly as a result, banning them may not have much of a short-term effect on wages.
Instead, some economists say, the more pronounced effect of a ban may come in the intermediate and long term, once the job market softens and workers no longer have as much leverage. At that point, noncompetes could begin to weigh more heavily on job switching and wages again.
"Doing something like this is a way to help sustain the increase in worker power over the last couple of years," said Heidi Shierholz, president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute, who was chief economist at the Labor Department during the Obama administration.

Full text: Bill Miller
Through Jan. 14. dieFirma, 32A Cooper Square, Manhattan; 347-699-1440; diefirmanyc.com.
Once upon a time, linoleum floors conjured the gleaming promise of the modern century: vibrant and new, a marvel of science and convenience. By midcentury, it was de rigueur in American kitchens, synonymous with the country's postwar perception of itself: hard wearing, resilient, never to fade. The sheen, like much of the rest of the American dream proved to be held together by asbestos, has since worn off; Americans pulled up their linoleum floors and tossed them into the dustbin of decorative history.
The artist Bill Miller resuscitates that past, and its attendant ghosts, splicing found linoleum sheets into dense, nearly hallucinatory collages depicting the landscapes and modest domestic interiors of the postindustrial towns he's known. Miller doesn't manipulate the finishes, relying on the factory-made colors and often assaultive patterns for his palette, a self-imposed constriction that becomes expansive freedom. It proves to be a remarkably versatile medium, and an affecting one. Miller salvages much of his material from abandoned homes in and around Pittsburgh, where he lives, and whose collapsed steel industry both allows for and tints the work here.
The conceptual interest could quickly become stale, but Miller's choices avoid gimmickry. His dedication to his material reads as devotional and empathetic, portraying the lives of his blue-collar subjects through the very stuff with which they were furnished. His pictures have a haunted quality; marks of wear remain visible, traces of the linoleum's previous life still present, faded but not forgotten. MAX LAKIN
'El Corazón Aúlla'
Through Jan. 21. The 8th Floor, 17 West 17th Street, Manhattan; 646-839-5908, the8thfloor.org.
Performance art may not be as radical as it was in the 1970s, but the exhibition "El Corazón Aúlla" ("The Heart Howls") reaffirms what a potent vehicle it is for subversive expression. Curated by Alexis Heller and Tatiana Muñoz-Brenes, the show features 14 Latin American female and nonbinary artists calling attention to a crisis of gender-based violence: According to the Gender Equality Observatory for Latin America and the Caribbean, at least 12 women per day were victims of femicide in the region in 2021. The artists take different approaches -- performing in public and private, alone or with others -- but are united by their unflinching vulnerability. They put their bodies on the line.
This includes Denise E. Reyes Amaya lying covered in garbage bags in the gutter of a San Salvador street in the video "Colored Bags for Trash" (2014); it's equally harrowing to watch passers-by ignore her and police officers poke her. In the video "Las Nobodies" (2011), the Mexican artist Nayla Altamirano walks meditatively along the border, collecting and donning bras left in the desert by the coyotes who sexually assaulted the women they were smuggling to the United States.
Some artists extend their vulnerability outward, like Elina Chauvet, who, in "My Hair for Your Name" (2014), cut off her locks and tied them with ribbons bearing the names of murdered women. Here, alongside those hanging locks and performance photos, the Mexican artist has set up a station where visitors are invited to do the same, pushing us to consider what we might be willing to risk or give up in sacrifice. JILLIAN STEINHAUER
Anton van Dalen
Through Jan. 28. PPOW Gallery, 390 Broadway, Manhattan; 212-647-1044, ppowgallery.com.
Anton van Dalen's training as a graphic artist is immediately apparent in his vivid prints and paintings, as well as his link to the East Village art scene in the 1980s, where graffiti, activist posters and wheat-pasted fliers ruled. The 47 pieces in "Doves: Where They Live and Work" surveys the oeuvre of the artist, who was born in the Netherlands in 1938 and moved to New York in 1966.
Van Dalen's style is mechanically surrealistic, recalling early-20th-century artists like Giorgio de Chirico and Francis Picabia, as well as '80s peers like Keith Haring and Mark Kostabi. Like these artists, his aesthetic world is simultaneously seductive and menacing. "The Horror Show of Science" (1981), a stark mural-size canvas, uses diagram-like images to show what science and technology have wrought, such as the atomic bomb and animal testing. Other paintings and drawings on lined notebook paper feature fighter planes, tanks ("war toys"), the effects of real estate development, the terror and isolation of the pandemic and how corporate giants like Coke, Amazon and Facebook have infiltrated our lives.
Birds also appear frequently here, serving, as the gallery release states, as emblems of "migration, freedom, peace, and community." Since 1971, van Dalen has also raised white pigeons that lived on the roof of his East Village building. It is a remarkable detail: The world is affected by upheavals and migrations, but van Dalen, his work and his activist approach have remained local, stable and consistent. MARTHA SCHWENDENER

Full text: In this sleazy slasher by the writer and director John Swab, a group of sex workers adopts a former member of a religious cult.
In "Candy Land," a group of truck-stop sex workers, or "lot lizards," assembles daily by a gas-station bench, scarfing down Twinkies and Coca-Cola between sexual romps in the back seat or the bathroom stall. It's not glamorous, but there is a certain allure to their world and its trailer-park chic, sustained by the patchwork heart of their found family. Girlfriends Sadie (Sam Quartin) and Liv (Virginia Rand), Riley (Eden Brolin), Levi (Owen Campbell), and Nora (Guinevere Turner), their madam of sorts, all live in a motel, but together they make it feel like home.
The work is dangerous -- at one point, Levi, the only male member of the crew, bludgeons a client to death in self-defense. But things soon get a little weirder: The bloodied body of a john turns up in the bathroom, his hands crossed over his chest in some kind of holy gesture; then Remy (Olivia Luccardi), a snaggletoothed virgin and a former member of a religious cult, appears at the bench, a bit too willing to be taken under the group's wing.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It's a textbook setup for a sleazy slasher. Written and directed by John Swab, "Candy Land" is standard grindhouse fare -- more serious and less conceptually adventurous than its recent counterparts, Ti West's "X" and "Pearl" -- though not without its fair share of pleasurable nastiness. Like West's porn-meets-evangelicalism double feature, "Candy Land" mines its thrills from the intersection of sex, repression and brainwashing.
It also pivots around the charms of its leading lady.
Luccardi, a genre regular, has the twinkling eyes of a lunatic. Last year, in the indie horror film "Soft & Quiet," she played the new girl in a club of white supremacists who reveals herself to be the most unhinged among them; as Remy, she gradually shows her cards in a similarly disturbing manner. She's a scream queen in the making, and "Candy Land" is her liveliest showcase yet.

Full text: Hosts of the cult podcast "Throwing Fits" gathered with friends and fans to weigh in on fashion and who's the coolest person in Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES -- The "Throwing Fits" holiday party, toasting the popular podcast that ridicules and reveres men's fashion equally, began just after 5 p.m. last Thursday, when Lawrence Schlossman and James Harris, the hosts of the show, stepped out of a car in front of Mohawk General Store in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles. They cradled packs of Budweiser and Modelo like infants they had rescued from a gas station.
Guests dressed in baggy work-wear pants, chic but fraying shirts, limited-edition sneakers and nubby fleeces. Many were regulars of the store or avid listeners of the podcast. Inside, there was a table with wine, liquor and CBD beverages.
Slowly the crowd ballooned and spilled outside the shop, a popular boutique owned by the husband-and-wife team Kevin and Bo Carney. Its stock list -- Our Legacy, Dries Van Noten, Stüssy, Bode -- is the sort that a listener of "Throwing Fits" would find appealing.
This is the second year that Mr. Harris and Mr. Schlossman have held the party, and has been a chance for them to create a real-world meet-up for their internet friends. All were welcome.
"I think anytime you have an online internet friendship and then you actually meet the person and you both realize that you're not weirdos, you realize that connection is real," Mr. Harris said.
We asked some of the attendees for their thoughts on the coolest person in Los Angeles, the worst trends of the year, and their predictions for the coming one. Here's what we heard. Interviews have been edited.
Lawrence Schlossman, 35, and James Harris, 36
Who's the coolest person in Los Angeles?
Mr. Harris: Kevin from Mohawk. The work speaks for itself. He does so many out there projects and executes them in a sick, tasteful way. The man decided to just launch a wine brand, called Loose Wines, and now the juice is loose.
Mr. Schlossman: I'm gonna say Nick Dierl. He's the most connected man in Los Angeles; he's the mayor. Every good restaurant, he has the batline. Whether it's Horses or Jitlada, he's the guy who'll get you the res with a moment's notice. What shows coolness like getting a reservation on a dime?
What will be the unexpected trend of 2023?
Mr. Schlossman: Leather for me. Pants, shirts, jackets. It never really went away. I'm just really drawn to that stuff. I just love the idea of a dude in leather.
Mr. Harris: I think it'll be casual grills. Nothing serious. Nothing too heavy, keep the hardware light. Maybe it's a one-piece or a two-piece.
Kevin Carney, 53
Who's the coolest person in Los Angeles?
Donald Glover. I think he's an amazing all-around Renaissance man. He does so many things so well. I look up to him for that. Style, cinema, writing, dialogue, everything he does.
Do you have any resolutions?
I want to work more with my hands. I want to garden more. Getting dirty with my hands gives me so much pleasure and, at the end of the day, if I'm covered in dirt I've had a better day than if I'm wearing some cool outfit.

Who's the coolest person in Los Angeles?
My therapist. He's a great listener. That's part of being cool, being a good listener.
What's a trend that you want to see die with the end of the year?
I can say what I hope, which is safety and cynicism is a trend I'd like to see go. In fashion or design -- I'd like to see more vulnerable stuff. I'd love to see less logos and more individuality and biographical stuff. That's what I'm trying to do, not just a mood board but to tell a story. That's why I love Margiela. You didn't know who he was but, through his work, you knew who he was.
What was the worst outfit you saw this year?
At Paris Fashion Week I met Angus McCloud, who seemed very nice. But he was literally wearing a piece from each luxury house. Like, on his hat he had two bandannas, one being Chanel the other being Louis Vuitton, and then the hat was, like, Dior.
Cody Pham, 27
What's a trend for 2022 that's got to go?
I'm really upset about the parachute pants thing. Because a lot of people put on a big pant and a small shirt and some sneakers and they think they're dressing. I'm not really big on that whole thing right now.
What trends are you excited about for 2023?
I'm actually really liking some of this strange Y2K stuff coming back. Obviously, it's been pretty heavy the last couple of years. But the continuation of the Jean Paul Gaultier, that kind of look and feel. And the old trainers from back then, getting rid of the whole chunky sneaker look. I've always liked an oversized pant with a slim shoe. I like seeing the Vans Half Cab making a comeback.
Do you have any style resolutions for next year?
I think I need to stop shopping but in general, my resolution is to only buy clothes made by my friends.
Marco Martinez, 29
Who's the coolest person in Los Angeles?
Twin Shadow. He's a musical artist who rides motorcycles. I love his music, and I got into motorcycles a few years ago. And I've actually met him, and he's really down-to-earth. Seeing that he was into motorcycles gave me permission to follow my passion with that. I love his personal style, and his live shows are some of the best. And then to have met him and he's this person you look up to and he's down to have a conversation and connect about the things you like is amazing.
What do you think people will be into next year?
I want people to keep appreciating vintage. Vintage is the canvas that a lot of designer pieces come from. It's sustainable, it's easy to acquire.
Do you have any style resolutions for next year?
I just want to buy one piece per season. Just four pieces. This year introduced me to a state of contentment. I'm very content with my wardrobe. And focusing on one piece per season will make me really intentional and buy something I really like.
Gil Campos, 24
What will be a trend in 2023?
I hope that consumers are smarter with what they buy. Companies like Shein are growing in popularity, but at the same time, with Gen Z coming up, they're also becoming more attentive in terms of what they buy.
What's a trend from this year you want to be done with?
Fake angst. It just leads to a pretentious vibe.
Do you have any style resolutions for 2023?
To stop buying shoes. I have like 10, but in reality, I only wear three of four.
Jon Alan, 31
Who's the coolest person in Los Angeles?
Well, the real answer is my girlfriend because she's the best communicator. But the cool answer would be that guy Edgy Albert. He's big on TikTok, he's a men's wear guy. He's very cool, and he's very sincere and very much a real person.
What's a trend from this year you want to be done?
Live podcast tapings where you buy tickets to go see a recording. It's just really weird. Like, you've kind of paid money to go eavesdrop on a conversation.
Do you have any style resolutions for yourself for next year?
No, I'm pretty happy with where I'm at right now. I'm happy with how little I've been spending money and how much versatility I've been getting out of my wardrobe. That's always a big thing for me -- versatility. I guess that's the main style resolution for me: continuing the pursuit of versatility and keeping it as light as possible.
Karl Charles, 25
Who's the coolest person in Los Angeles?
I'm honestly still looking for him. He hasn't revealed himself yet. I mean, it could be anyone, I take fashion inspiration from my homie who works up the street at the florist shop. My roommate, Drok -- I take inspiration from him, and he takes it from me. It's a feedback loop.
What's a trend you think will be big next year?
I love the way that denim is coming back. I love people getting into cuts and fits and silhouettes.
What trend do you want to die with 2022?
I really want logos to end. Any type of embroidery work or block-printing, or dyeing -- let's do that. I don't need someone signaling to me where they bought something.
Do you have any style resolutions for next year?
Just to keep learning and fill in the gaps in my wardrobe. Like, if denim is going to be big next year, then accessory items for denim will be bigger, like key chains or T-shirts, or boots. Just building that world.
