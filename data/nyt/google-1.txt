Unlike many of his fellow New Jerseyans, Ian Whelan seems too polite to broadcast his gripes about the state’s much-maligned commuter railroad. But a new plan to raise train fares by 15% set him off.
Whelan, whose wife, Tamara, regularly rides New Jersey Transit to and from her job at Carnegie Hall, posted on social media last week challenging Gov. Philip Murphy to improve the service before asking commuters to pay more.
“It just feels like it’s gotten progressively unreliable,” he said after calling out the governor. “If it felt like it was going in the right direction, it might feel like this is a little more warranted.”
Murphy’s response sounded like a reprise of “Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?”
Improvements in reliability, safety and on-time performance, the governor said last week, justify the proposal to raise fares for the first time since he took office six years ago. Just days before, he had told a group of bond analysts that the state had “in many respects fixed NJ Transit through the customers’ lens.”
But New Jersey Transit’s own figures and customer surveys reflect a different view of the agency’s operations.
At the same time that the agency is pushing for a fare increase, New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority is making final preparations to enact a congestion pricing plan that would add a significant toll on any driver entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The plan would mean that most New Jersey commuters, whether they ride the train or drive into Manhattan, could soon be squeezed for more money.
On a scale of 1 to 10, the average overall rating from New Jersey Transit riders last spring was 6.9. (That was still an improvement from a 5.8 average five years ago.)
The agency’s self-reported statistics show that it met its goal of running 94.7% of its trains on time in only three of the past 36 months.
By contrast, New York’s Metro-North Railroad reported that its commuter train service east of the Hudson River had met that standard in all of those 36 months. The Long Island Rail Road said it had done so in 25 of them.
In addition, New Jersey Transit’s trains break down much more frequently than those run by the region’s other commuter railroads. In 2022, the last year for which federal data was available, the agency had 455 mechanical failures, up from 409 in 2021. The LIRR had 97. Metro-North had just 75. New Jersey Transit says that Metro-North and the LIRR have a different type of train that can complete trips even when a train car breaks down, incidents that are not included in that data.
On Wednesday, Janno Lieber, CEO of the MTA, broke normal protocols and took a swipe at Murphy, saying, “Phil Murphy said he was going to fix NJ Transit if it kills him. I’m not sure. He’s not dying, and I’m not even sure if he’s trying.” New Jersey officials have attacked the MTA’s congestion pricing plan, which will help pay for improvements to New York’s subway system, as an unfair tax on New Jersey commuters.
After New Jersey Transit announced its proposed fare increase, some of its riders at Newark Penn Station noted their dissatisfaction with the system’s service.
“My commuting is the same beast I’ve been dealing with for years,” said Julianne Austin, who lives in Manalapan, New Jersey, and works in Newark, New Jersey. She questioned how her fares were being spent, given the frequency of delays.
“You’ve got to build into your brain that if you need to be somewhere at an exact time, it’s not going to happen,” Austin, 28, said. “If you’re a very Type A personality, you’re going to have an aneurysm.”
Mohammad Ayoubi, who was waiting to board a Raritan Valley line train home to South Plainfield, New Jersey, from Manhattan, was more blunt.
“The delays, the cancellations out of nowhere — it’s absolute garbage,” Ayoubi, a nurse, said, adding: “If I don’t get to work on time, people die.”
The proposal last week to raise fares by 15% on July 1 — and by 3% annually starting in 2025 — met a hail of opposition from elected officials and transit advocates, who said the state should find other sources of revenue to resolve the agency’s looming budget deficits.
New Jersey Transit received $4.4 billion in aid from the federal government after the pandemic sharply reduced ridership, but the bulk of that money has already been spent.
The agency says commuters have largely returned to its trains and buses, though in smaller numbers on Mondays and Fridays. But last year the agency took in about half as much from those riders as it had been collecting before the pandemic.
With many customers still working from home at least a couple of days a week, the agency is selling far fewer monthly passes. For the past three years, it has been offering the Flexpass, which gives a 20% discount to customers who make 20 trips per month. But now the agency plans to eliminate the pass.
Whelan, 42, said his wife had been buying a Flexpass to get to Manhattan from their home in Gillette, New Jersey, at a cost of $196. After a 15% increase, a monthly pass would cost her $406.
Placing such a hefty burden on commuters is misguided public policy, said Alex Ambrose, an analyst with the research group New Jersey Policy Perspective: “That is exactly the wrong mindset.”
For years, Ambrose and other transit advocates have called for a permanent solution to New Jersey Transit’s financial straits. Unlike many other mass-transit systems in the country, the agency does not have a dedicated source of revenue. It relies on annual appropriations from the state to supplement what it receives from the federal government and its customers.
But the pandemic upended that structure. In 2019, fares accounted for more than 40% of the agency’s revenue, about $970 million. Last year, that share was just 25%, or about $700 million, a New Jersey Transit spokesperson said.
New Jersey Transit projects a deficit of more than $100 million in the fiscal year that starts July 1 and nearly $800 million in the following year. The fare increase would bridge the first gap, the agency says. But the second will require a massive increase in the state’s contribution.
Murphy said the proposed fare increase was fair because he had waited to propose it until the quality of service was restored. As evidence, he pointed to an award the agency received last year that he said was for the No. 1 transit system in the country.
But it wasn’t. The award, from the American Public Transportation Association, was for outstanding achievement among the largest systems in the country — sort of a “most improved” trophy.

Biden Takes a Holiday On a Caribbean Island But Stays Plugged In: [National Desk]

Full text: The president is enjoying a working vacation, a White House official said. Residents hope to bring attention to the Virgin Islands' economic troubles.
As wars rage in Gaza and Ukraine, migrants stream illegally into the United States in record numbers and an intense 2024 campaign season looms, President Biden is lying low.
Here on tropical St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Mr. Biden; the first lady, Jill Biden; and their granddaughter Natalie are spending New Year's week in a secluded oceanfront villa overlooking the turquoise Caribbean, the president is staying mostly out of the spotlight.
On Saturday, Mr. Biden made his first public appearance, venturing out to attend mass at Holy Cross Catholic Church in Christiansted, the largest town in St. Croix. He and Dr. Biden later taped an interview with Ryan Seacrest, due to air on New Year's Eve as part of ABC's "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest." In the evening, the president and first lady dined at Too Chez, one of the island's top restaurants, and he afterward revealed his New Year's resolution.
"To come back next year," Mr. Biden said.
Republicans have roundly criticized Mr. Biden's island getaway, which began just a day after he returned to the White House from spending Christmas with family at Camp David.
Several lawmakers accused the president of failing to address the migrant surge along the southern U.S. border by taking time away. And on Thursday, when the White House announced in the morning that there would be no public events for Mr. Biden that day as temperatures hovered in the 80s on St. Croix, an arm of the Republican National Committee pounced.
"Illegal immigrants are pouring across the open southern border by the tens of thousands every day," the group RNC Research wrote on the social media site X, adding that Mr. Biden, "on his second vacation in a week -- called it a day before noon."
Julian Zelizer, a historian at Princeton University, said that presidential vacations are virtually always denounced by the opposing party.
But even a commander in chief needs to unwind sometimes, Mr. Zelizer noted, and, in this day and age, no president is ever truly unplugged.
"It's not as if the president takes a vacation like many of us and just sits around on the beach or something," he said. "They go with their full presidential apparatus and they're surrounded by their advisers."
A White House official described Mr. Biden's trip as a working vacation. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, accompanied the president to St. Croix and has briefed him multiple times since arriving, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president's schedule.
On Friday, Mr. Biden condemned Russia for launching what he called the largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the start of the war, and he issued a statement warning that President Vladimir V. Putin "must be stopped." Asked Saturday if he planned to speak with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine after Russia's latest attacks, Mr. Biden replied, "I speak to him regularly."
He also called on Congress on Friday to approve national security funding for Ukraine and Israel, which has been tied to negotiations over border and immigration policies, and White House officials said the president was closely monitoring those talks, too.
Many St. Croix residents said that, even though Mr. Biden was staying largely out of the public eye this year, they appreciated that his visits have helped highlight the history of the island, which was once home to the founding father Alexander Hamilton. They described it as a quirky, warmhearted island where stray cats are well fed at five-star resorts. In Lin Manuel-Miranda's musical "Hamilton," St. Croix features only as the "forgotten spot in the Caribbean," from which a young Hamilton pulled himself out of poverty.
Mr. Biden's visit is his second to St. Croix as president, but the Bidens have traveled there more than a dozen times over the years.
"He loves St. Croix, and we really love having him here," said Leonore Gillette, a retired schoolteacher who has lived on the island for 45 years.
"We certainly appreciate the infusion of activity," said Nadia Bougouneau, another longtime resident who works at the Buccaneer, a resort that was filled to capacity with Secret Service agents and members of the media traveling with Mr. Biden. The president played on the 18-hole golf course at the resort last year with his grandson Hunter.
Several people, including the governor of the Virgin Islands, fondly recalled Mr. Biden's visits before he was president -- and the Secret Service was not blocking miles of roads for security. Back then, locals and tourists said they would run into him biking, jogging or picking up coffee at Ziggy's, an island market and gas station on the east end.
"We feel like he's a Virgin Islander," Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. said.
"Before he was president, I would be downtown at night and see him in a restaurant, and I'd be sitting with people and say, 'That's Joe Biden.' And people would say, 'No way,"' he recalled.
These days, the governor said, Mr. Biden's visit gave him a chance to highlight some of the issues facing the U.S. Virgin Islands, which is heavily dependent on tourism and still working to recover from the hurricanes Irma and Maria.
Mr. Bryan called the islands' most serious challenge a requirement to match 10 percent of $ 15 billion in federal hurricane reconstruction aid. He said the money, and the ability of the Virgin Islands to repair its water systems and other major projects, could be jeopardized because the government cannot afford the approximately $ 1.5 billion match. The Virgin Islands, home to about 87,000 people, has an annual budget of $ 1.2 billion.
Still, Mr. Bryan said, he does not view Mr. Biden's New Year's visit as the best time to make his case to the president.
"To be honest, I preferred it when he wasn't president because he spent more time with me," he joked, adding that this year, "I really try to stay away from him so he can get a chance to rest, because he's going to need it to go into this election."
Mr. Biden is entering 2024 with a persistently low job approval rating of 39 percent, according to December polling from Gallup, the worst of any modern-day president seeking re-election. Mr. Zelizer said that makes the policy challenges Mr. Biden faces in the Middle East and Ukraine -- and with Congress -- all the more difficult.
"All of this is going to be waiting for him when he comes back to Washington, and he knows it," Mr. Zelizer said. He added, "It's going to be a tough year."

Beyond the Freeway, Southern California Shines: [Correction]

Full text: Perhaps nothing defines Los Angeles like the freeways: ribbons of asphalt and steel (and traffic jams) tying coast, valley and mountains together in a multilane, limited-access web. These highways were considered so essential that planners nearly jammed one right through the center of swanky Beverly Hills.
But it wasn't always this way. Before the first freeway opened in December 1940, Angelenos got from place to place on lazy two-lane roads that cut through a classic Southern California landscape of hills, canyons, ranches, and orange and avocado farms, some following the original stagecoach routes.
Fortunately, many of these back roads still exist, even if the citrus groves have transmogrified into mostly multimillion-dollar homes. One sunny morning, I set out on a route from my home near the San Fernando Valley to the wine country northwest of Santa Barbara, close to 100 miles away. My mission: to discover the unexpected museums, hundred-year-old restaurants, small towns and other sites that have endured but remained hidden from the cars whizzing by at 75 miles per hour.
1. Plummer House/Leonis Adobe
2. King Gillette Ranch
3. The Old Place
4. Satwiwa Native American Indian Cultural Center
5. Mullin Automotive Museum
6. California Oil Museum
7. Ojai Valley Overlook
8. Boccali's Pizza and Pasta
9. Lake Casitas
10. Cold Spring Tavern
Old Hollywood and a ranch that razors built
The off-piste adventure begins by exiting the 101/Ventura Freeway in Calabasas, at the Valley Circle turnoff. The town is home not only to the Kardashians, Kevin Hart and other celebrities, but also to a blue Victorian bungalow once known as the "oldest house in Hollywood," despite now being many miles from the Walk of Fame. Built in the 1870s, the Plummer House was relocated here in 1983 from what is now Plummer Park in West Hollywood.
The Plummer House sits next to its contemporary, the Leonis Adobe, built for Miguel Leonis, a French Basque immigrant and major Los Angeles landowner nicknamed the King of Calabasas. The two-story adobe brick home with wraparound verandas remains furnished as when it was first occupied in the 1870s. Admission to the Leonis Adobe museum is available on weekends only, at no charge.
A more modern attraction in Old Town Calabasas, a collection of modest clothing shops and eateries that has grown up in the surrounding former farmland, is Sagebrush Cantina, a nearly 50-year-old Mexican restaurant featuring live music and karaoke.
At the intersection of Las Virgenes Road and the famed Mulholland Highway -- which opened in 1928 -- you'll find the 588-acre King Gillette Ranch, the namesake of the razor magnate who once owned it. Free to visit and now part of a national recreation area, the ranch showcases a 1920s Spanish Colonial Revival mansion designed by Wallace Neff, an early-20th-century architect credited with creating the "California style." The house and grounds, approached by driving down a long eucalyptus-tree-lined road, were settings for the TV series "The Biggest Loser."
Emerging from the woods along the Mulholland Highway, a dark, rustic cabin signals you've reached the Old Place restaurant. The building, which served as the Cornell, Calif., post office until 1970, is owned and run by Morgan Runyon, the son of the founder, Tom. If the name Runyon sounds familiar, it may be because the clan once owned Runyon Canyon, now a park in the Hollywood Hills whose hiking trail draws celebrities.
Clad in wood inside and out, the restaurant, which specializes in steaks grilled over local red oak, is open Thursday through Sunday, and offers tight seating inside, as well as in the adjacent old mail sorting room and tables scattered among the trees on the large, rural property.
See a Chumash village, then gawk at old cars
As you head toward the foot of the Santa Monica Mountains and the community of Hidden Valley on Potrero Road, the suburbs give way to pastures. The area, nestled against the mountains, is known for horse breeding and famous former residents like Ellen DeGeneres and Sophia Loren, as well as current ones like Britney Spears. Its minimum-eight-acre lots line the roadside behind white picket fences, creating a backdrop that has served as the setting for many car commercials.
Descending the steep, curving road to the coast, you pass the Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center, part of a National Park Service site preserving a former Chumash village. On weekends, Native American guides are available to discuss the Chumash culture and show visitors a replica of a Chumash home, a domelike structure called an 'ap. There is no charge to visit.
Once you are on flatter land, get ready to jostle with slow-moving farm trucks as you pass by tiny cottages and roadside farm stands hawking two-for- $ 1 avocados.
If you love old cars and you are traveling on a Friday or a Saturday, take a detour to the Mullin Automotive Museum. Founded by Peter Mullin, an insurance industry executive, the museum, hidden in a nondescript industrial park in the town of Oxnard features French vehicles from the 1890s to the present. The collection includes everything from a boxy, pristine open-cabin 1910 Renault to streamlined 1930s vehicles, as well as a large collection of early Bugatti racing cars. And they're all housed in an Art Deco-style interior.
An oil rig and a stagecoach stop
Across the Santa Clara River, you'll find the quiet town of Santa Paula, its main street a string of low-slung connected shops. On a prominent corner along Main Street, the California Oil Museum occupies the original oversize 1890s Victorian headquarters of the Union Oil Company, serving up a history of California's oil industry, and featuring a working 19th-century oil rig. The museum is currently closed, but there are plans in the works to reopen it.
As Main Street becomes Route 150, you'll cruise down a lush winding road devoid of other vehicles, passing by citrus groves and through thick wooded areas. Be sure to stop at the Ojai Valley Overlook. This rest stop offers a bird's-eye view of the green Ojai valley floor and farmland below, in a bowl surrounded by the Topatopa Mountains.
On your descent into the Ojai valley, you'll pass Boccali's Pizza and Pasta, part of the Boccali family winery. The restaurant has the air of a bistro one might encounter bicycling through an Alpine village in Slovenia, along with extensive outdoor seating. The build-your-own-pizza menu also features an assortment of standard pasta dishes. A stand on the porch offers farm-grown 50-cent grapefruits and lemons, $ 10 bags of oranges and $ 1 avocados. Payment for the produce is on the honor system.
You'll then circumnavigate almost all of Lake Casitas, a three-mile-long reservoir that provides drinking water to Ojai and surrounding areas. Fishing, boating, and camping are allowed, but don't even think about taking a swim: As the water is for human consumption, bodily contact is forbidden.
Passing through Montecito on Route 192, you'll see plenty of hedges and imposing gates concealing multiacre estates priced in the $ 10 million to $ 25 million range -- and up. Close to but still secluded from Santa Barbara, the town is home to such luminaries as Oprah Winfrey and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, a.k.a. Harry and Meghan. John and Jacqueline Kennedy honeymooned at the secluded San Ysidro Ranch, where accommodations now start at $ 2,495 per night, plus taxes, meals included.
Northwest of Santa Barbara, just over San Marcos Pass, you'll find Stagecoach Road. Named for the vehicles that originally traveled it, the road parallels Route 154 before plunging through a wooded area to the Cold Spring Tavern. This structure, which began as a stagecoach stop in 1868, drew travelers looking for respite from the bumpy ride -- as well as those looking to rob the cash boxes carried by Wells Fargo.
The menu of the rustic vine-covered restaurant with a wood-and-stone interior is heavily weighted toward meat, offering modestly priced burgers as well as chicken, steak, tri-tip, and wild boar. It sits next to a tiny, abandoned jail -- brought over the mountains from Ojai -- and a road gang house built in 1868 by 11 Chinese immigrants to sleep in while they worked on the road over San Marcos Pass.
Land of 5,000 olives
From the Cold Spring Tavern, you'll continue driving along a two-lane mountain road, past grazing cattle and burned-out tree stumps that mingle with fresh growth, lingering evidence of the sometimes catastrophic wildfires that occur every few years.
In 30 minutes, you'll reach Los Olivos, a rural community with a small-town feel. Founded in 1887 as a stagecoach stop and still graced by some Victorian homes, the town was originally named after 5,000 olive trees in a local ranch.
Grand Avenue, its main street, is home to tasting outlets of local wineries, a handful of clothing stores and galleries with crafts, art and photographs.
Panino offers a wide range of grilled sandwiches and salads. The Los Olivos Wine Merchant and Café sells more than 250 wines in its shop, while its restaurant features mostly local produce, as well as fish and meat dishes.
For those looking to stay the night, the 15-room, Victorian-style Ballard Inn tempts travelers with a wraparound porch, a happy hour with wine and snacks, and a secluded setting in the nearby village of Ballard. Depending on the time of year, rates can start at around $ 245 a night.
In Los Olivos, the newly reconstructed Inn at Mattei's Tavern, now part of the Auberge chain, offers upscale accommodations, with rooms from about $ 630, depending on the time of year.
Wherever you stay or how long you spend enjoying Los Olivos, one thing is almost certain: If you take the freeway back to Los Angeles, you'll be there in half the time -- with more than twice the traffic. But if you choose the back roads, with their curves, historic sites, overlooks, restaurants and roadside attractions, those extra hours on the road will be time well spent.

What 'Out of Office' Looked Like a Century Ago: [Review]

Full text: The Mint Theater revives Elizabeth Baker's charming 1917 comedy, which offers a gentle reminder about work-life balance.
Find a job that you love and you'll work every day of your life. So warns "Partnership," the third Elizabeth Baker play to be staged by the Mint Theater Company, which has long nurtured the works of forgotten playwrights. Baker's play premiered in 1917 in London, but the way it tackles the issue of work-life balance seems to speak more to the Great Resignation than to the Great War.
The owner of a successful boutique in the south of England, Kate (Sara Haider) is focused on the needs of her distinguished clients. When George Pillatt (Gene Gillette), a potential rival, instead proposes a merger, marriage is part of the deal. The union, Kate understands, would be purely professional.
As another character remarks, in one of the play's most impressively undated lines, "Men are a lot, aren't they?"
Kate takes more of a shine to Pillatt's companion Lawrence Fawcett (Joshua Echebiri), a gadabout investor with mud on his boots and a glint in his eye. Fawcett inspires Kate to contemplate a new way of life, including the exquisite novelty of a day off. In the show's breeziest scene, the pair behold the Downs, an expanse of land and sky expressed in a breathtaking backdrop: The characters effectively step into a landscape painting (adapted from an artwork by James Hart Dyke) within the gilded frame provided by the scenic designer Alexander Woodward. It's a testament to the production that it conjures the sense of a shimmering vista in a tiny theater.
If the director Jackson Grace Gay tries a little too hard to coax out new laughs, the cast handles Baker's gentle comedy with evident affection. Echebiri's Fawcett comes alive in his natural habitat, while Gillette's Pillatt has the constrained movements of one who thinks a leisurely walk is a waste of time. As Kate's friend and associate Maisie, Olivia Gilliatt is having nearly as much fun as the costume designer (Kindall Almond) is having dressing her. Her ready energy and comical, gale force yawp could command a larger theater.
Written during the height of the women's suffrage movement in the United States, this English playwright's portrait of a driven businesswoman -- two driven businesswomen, actually -- feels boldly up-to-date. Refreshingly, by contrast, it treats some of the male characters as more or less incidental.
The suggestion of farce never materializes, but there is class critique in the play's portrayal of characters' couture concerns and their endless talking shop.
The plot itself -- Kate's transformation from workaholic to not-so-quiet quitter -- barely rattles a teacup. But "Partnership" charms regardless, offering a gentle reminder about not letting work overtake your life. Some notions should never fall out of fashion.
Partnership
Through Nov. 12 at Theater Row, Manhattan; bfany.org. Running time: 2 hours 20 minutes.

Green Energy in Wyoming? Give Incentives to the Rich.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: If the area around Jackson, Wyo., boasts two things, they're natural resources and very rich locals. Nathan Wendt is trying to use the Biden administration's clean energy incentives to bring the two together.
Mr. Wendt, the president of the Jackson Hole Center for Global Affairs, has spent years working on issues related to climate change and local economic development. And as President Biden pushed one climate-related policy after another through Congress -- first the infrastructure law, and then the Inflation Reduction Act -- and a dizzying array of tax credits, loans and grants became available, he sensed an opportunity.
"For Jackson Hole investors looking for the next big thing, there's no need to look beyond state lines," Mr. Wendt wrote this spring in an opinion essay in The Jackson Hole News & Guide, where he extolled the "flush tax credits" the law provided. "This decade's great money-making opportunity," he wrote, "will be in investing in net zero projects in energy communities, including in Wyoming."
Wyoming is both the nation's largest coal producer and a Republican stronghold where the clean energy transition has at times faced stark opposition. Its entire congressional delegation voted against the Inflation Reduction Act. But the state is unusually well suited to benefit from some of the green incentives the government is offering.
Wyoming's geology and legal landscape make it a top candidate for fledgling carbon capture technologies, which the law promotes through sweetened and extended tax credits. Its existing pipeline infrastructure and energy industry work force could help with hydrogen development. And, perhaps most important, the state has plenty of people whom the Inflation Reduction Act is courting -- well-heeled investors who are looking for a way to turn a profit off the green energy transition.
The Biden administration's climate law works by attracting private capital to clean energy. While the plan includes targeted grants, many of its potentially most significant provisions aim to transition the nation's energy supply -- and its energy work force -- by luring people with capital to invest. Tax breaks and other incentives mean it's more attractive to make financial bets on risky, but possibly transformational, green technologies.
That has Mr. Wendt and other climate researchers across the state looking at Jackson, a town full of potential investors who could pour money into new projects. The elite enclave nestled next to Grand Teton National Park boasts the highest-income county in the United States by some measures. And, Mr. Wendt reasons, many of its millionaires and billionaires work in financial markets but decamped from big coastal cities because they loved the natural beauty that Wyoming has to offer.

They might, he figures, have both the money and the motivation to make local climate investment a reality.
"Teton County has been historically disconnected from the wider Wyoming economic story," Mr. Wendt said on a late August morning in Jackson's town square, a few yards away from an arch made of elk antlers and a few hundred yards away from a number of wealth management offices. "We're trying to bridge that gap."
It's not just Mr. Wendt who has sensed a profit opportunity. Investors and companies across the country have taken notice. Just since August, about 150 corporations have talked about the Inflation Reduction Act during investor presentations, based on Bloomberg transcripts.
In fact, interest has exceeded expectations. The Congressional Budget Office had at one point forecast that energy and climate outlays tied to the law would total about $ 391 billion from 2022 to 2031, with more than 60 percent of that coming from claims for various tax credits.
But Goldman Sachs analysts have estimated that the total could be three times that amount, as people and businesses make much heavier use of the incentives than the government expected. That could mean that some $ 3 trillion pours into green energy investment over the coming decade -- $ 1.2 trillion from the government in the form of tax credits and other incentives, matched by even more in capital from private companies. While their estimates are on the high side, other research groups and the government itself have revised their forecasts upward.
Wyoming, for its part, could be well placed to take advantage of some of the law's more cutting-edge provisions. Some estimates have suggested that the state could see the largest per capita investment related to the legislation of any state in the nation.
The opportunities are linked to both local policies and local resources, said Scott Quillinan, the senior director of research for the School of Energy Resources at the University of Wyoming.
For instance, the law incentivizes hydrogen development with a new tax credit, making it a much cheaper potential fuel. Wyoming already has pipeline and rail networks that could help transport hydrogen mixtures, Mr. Quillinan said.
The law also expanded a tax credit for what is known as direct carbon sequestration, the process of removing carbon from the air and storing it underground or turning it into new products. Wyoming is home to spongelike rocks filled with pockets of saltwater, which are ideal for storing captured carbon. It is also easier to get the necessary permits to set up such projects in Wyoming than in many other states.
And while it used to be difficult to make cost-intensive direct capture projects pencil out, the law changed that, increasing the credit for directly captured carbon stored in saline rock formations to $ 180 per ton from $ 50.
"The incentives finally make these investments profitable," said Michele Della Vigna, a researcher at Goldman.
Environmentalists sometimes question both hydrogen and direct carbon capture technologies, in part because they're relatively untested. But since the law's passage last year, announcements of carbon capture projects -- including a large one in Wyoming -- have spiked.
Project Bison, a carbon capture facility under development by the firm CarbonCapture, is set to be the biggest project of its kind, and big names like BCG and Microsoft have signed on for its carbon removal credits.
Jonas Lee, CarbonCapture's chief commercial officer, said that, without the law, the project would most likely have been smaller and slower moving. Even with the law's help, its planned opening this year has been delayed. Mr. Lee did not provide a reason or a new opening date, but said the firm still expected to operate at scale.
Rusty Bell, the director of the Office of Economic Transformation at the Gillette College Foundation in Wyoming, thinks the administration's climate push is destined for such hiccups. New technologies take time to roll out. The maze of incentives and grants on offer can be difficult to navigate.
But Mr. Bell, who wrote the opinion essay with Mr. Wendt, also says Campbell County, where he is based, recognizes that its future as a coal-producing area will hinge partly on seizing new technologies. Residents can look at flailing coal communities elsewhere and realize "we don't want to be like that in 10, 15, 20 years," he said.

Ex-President Tries to Court Workers at Nonunion Plant: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A day after President Biden appeared on a union picket line, the former president spoke at an auto parts factory in Michigan.
Seeking more of the voters who paved his way to the White House in 2016, former President Donald J. Trump rallied at a Michigan auto parts factory on Wednesday night, vying for the support of blue-collar workers one day after President Biden appeared on a picket line with striking United Automobile Workers.
Mr. Biden on Tuesday affirmed his support for U.A.W. strikers' demands for a 40 percent pay raise. In his appearance at a nonunion factory on Wednesday, Mr. Trump repeatedly asked for the endorsement of the U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain -- calling him "Shawn" -- but did not back any of the union's contract demands.
"Your head man, Shawn, he's a good man," Mr. Trump told the crowd, though it was unclear if there were more than a handful of U.A.W. members present. "But he's got to endorse Trump."
Mr. Fain, who appeared with Mr. Biden during his visit to the picket line, has withheld the union's endorsement, saying it must be earned. But Mr. Fain has been clear that the U.A.W. would never support Mr. Trump, who pursued many anti-union policies in office.
At the same time, Mr. Trump was seeking to drive a wedge between rank-and-file workers and their leaders over the issue of electric vehicles, which he repeatedly attacked as an existential threat to American car companies and workers. He claimed that a clean-air proposal by the administration that calls for two out of three new cars sold to be electric by 2032 would decimate Detroit.
"I will not allow, under any circumstances, the American auto industry to die," Mr. Trump said. "I want it to thrive."
"Get your union leaders to endorse me, and I'll take care of the rest," Mr. Trump said.
The U.A.W., which argues that the transition to electric vehicles is inevitable and that it is driven by market forces, seeks to ensure that zero-emission vehicles are made by workers in the United States earning union wages.
Coming at the same time that other Republican primary candidates were in California debating on national television, Mr. Trump's appearance outside Detroit sent the message that he had all but moved on from his lower-polling rivals and was focused on the potential for a rematch with Mr. Biden in 2024.
Mr. Trump, whose polling lead over his closest rivals has grown to around 40 points, twisted the knife by suggesting that everyone else was now running to work for him in a second Trump administration. He called his rivals "job candidates."
"They'll do anything," he said. "Secretary of something, they even say V.P., does anybody see any V.P. in the group? I don't think so."
Mr. Trump spoke at Drake Enterprises in Clinton Township, north of Detroit. The company's 150 employees make gearshift levers for heavy-duty trucks, as well as components that go into cars made by General Motors and Ford. Its president, Nathan Stemple, said it was a nonunion shop.
Before the former president took the stage, a few hundred people were seated on the floor of the factory, and at least one man in a red U.A.W. T-shirt said he was a union member and voiced support for the strike. Two people holding "Union Members for Trump" signs said they were not union members. The Trump campaign made no effort to recruit attendees through U.A.W. locals, according to the union.
Hours after appearing with Mr. Biden on a picket line on Tuesday outside a G.M. facility in Belleville, Mich., Mr. Fain told CNN: "I find a pathetic irony that the former president is going to hold a rally for union members at a nonunion business."
Mr. Fain denounced Mr. Trump's lack of support during a strike against G.M. in 2019, when Mr. Trump was in office, and said he had no plans to meet with the former president during his visit.
Mr. Trump has long sought to separate rank-and-file union members from union leaders, who largely endorse Democrats. He has had notable success: He won about four in 10 votes from union households in 2020, according to exit polls.
On Tuesday, as Mr. Biden became the first president of modern times to join a picket line, Mr. Trump issued a statement predicting that "in three years there will be no autoworker jobs" if Mr. Biden's policies prevail. He hammered that same message in his address on Wednesday, accusing Mr. Biden of "economic treason."
The Biden campaign responded by saying that Mr. Trump's record in office showed he was far more interested in making billionaires richer than in helping the middle class.
"Donald Trump's low-energy, incoherent 'speech' at a nonunion factory in Michigan was a pathetic, recycled attempt to feign support for working Americans," Kevin Munoz, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said in a statement. "Americans have seen him try this before and they aren't buying it. They know who Donald Trump really is: a billionaire charlatan running on empty words, broken promises and lost jobs."
Marick Masters, a professor of business with a focus on labor issues at Wayne State University in Detroit, said the economic uncertainty around the transition to electric vehicles worried many autoworkers, providing Mr. Trump with a political opening.
"There's a big question about how successful these companies are going to be in the transition to electric vehicles," he said. "Trump's message resonates, and it cuts across a broad swath of workers."
Mr. Stemple, Drake's president, said a too-rapid switch to electric vehicles would decimate his family company. He noted that electric vehicles did not require gearshift levers, one of his main products. "A lot of shops like us wouldn't survive that transition if it happened rapidly," he said.
Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a group that seeks common ground between unions and environmentalists, said Mr. Trump's claim that the E.V. transition would drive American jobs to China "is almost exactly backwards." In August, the administration said it would invest up to $ 12 billion to help automakers convert factories to electric and hybrid car production.
"What the Biden administration is trying to do is actually bring jobs back from China by investing in revitalizing American auto manufacturing," Mr. Walsh said.
Mr. Trump's record with autoworkers is decidedly mixed. During his term, he pressured automakers to keep their factories in the United States rather than producing more vehicles in Mexico. Auto manufacturing jobs climbed in his first year in office, before flattening and dipping -- and then the pandemic sent them plunging. Under Mr. Biden, auto jobs have exceeded their highest level under Mr. Trump.
The location of Mr. Trump's speech carried political symbolism: Macomb County, north of Detroit, was home to the original "Reagan Democrats," the blue-collar voters who in the 1980s deserted the party that had traditionally advanced their standard of living, in favor of Republican messaging coded in racial division.

Strikes and Deep Roots: 'Good Stories in Detroit': [National Desk]

Full text: As electric vehicles usher in a new era for the car economy and workers strike against rooted manufacturers, Neal E. Boudette is in Motor City to cover it all.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
For the first time in the nearly 90-year history of the United Auto Workers, the union is on strike against all three of the large Detroit automakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler -- at the same time.
The targeted strike, which started on Sept. 15 and expanded last Friday, has shut down three auto plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri, and 38 parts distribution centers operated by G.M. and Stellantis. About 18,300 U.A.W. members are on strike while the union demands a 40 percent pay increase. The shutdowns affect only a few car models, but a protracted strike would affect consumers and the U.S. economy.
Neal E. Boudette, who covers the auto industry from Detroit for The New York Times, has been reporting on the negotiations between the union and automakers. He has covered the automobile industry since 2002, when he was in Germany working for The Wall Street Journal. He joined The Times in 2016.
In an interview, Mr. Boudette spoke about the evolution of the industry, its symbolism in the United States and what this strike could mean for other automakers. This interview has been edited and condensed.
President Biden visited a picket line in Michigan this week, which has been described as unprecedented for a sitting president. Does this strike feel different from U.A.W.'s strike at General Motors in 2019, or ones before that?
A lot of the strikes in the past 20 years have been symbolic more than strategic. This year, it's a totally different dynamic. The union has a very strong negotiating position. The car companies are making tons of money, and workers have not received raises that have kept up with inflation. The workers have a lot of support from the public.
There have been strikes in the past that were very contentious and even resulted in street clashes. But in the 21st century, there hasn't been a strike like this.
You worked in Germany before coming to Detroit. How do the settings compare?
Detroit is Motor City. The whole region has this very strong connection to automobiles. There's a century-long history and a great deal of culture built around the automobile. The Detroit Red Wings -- their logo is a winged wheel.
It was less so in Germany. I was based in Frankfurt, not an auto center. Opel was a little bit outside of Frankfurt, and Mercedes was south of Frankfurt. B.M.W. was down in Munich; Volkswagen was up north in Wolfsburg. Each of those towns is a little like Detroit, but you didn't have the concentration that you have in Detroit.
How has the evolution of electric vehicles changed your beat?
The biggest trend is electrification, and there are many different aspects of it. Aside from the fact that you have to get these cars designed and developed and produced, there's a social aspect to it. We need chargers all over the place, and charging a car is a different social experience than filling up your gas tank.
Then there's the climate aspect. The evolution of the industry to electronic vehicles has been called the biggest transition the industry has seen since the introduction of the moving assembly line.
The beat is multifaceted now. Before the financial crisis, it wasn't quite like that. There was a technology race, but it was a very limited technology race. And now it's taking on a much greater breadth.
What affects will the strike have on the industry?
Eventually the union and automakers will come up with an agreement. And then the next big question will be: How much of a burden does this contract put on these companies? Their competitors -- Toyota, Volkswagen, Honda, Kia -- are foreign companies who operate nonunion factories. Most of their workers make considerably less than the top U.A.W. wage.
In recent years, U.A.W. tried to organize a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee and a Nissan plant in Mississippi, and the workers voted down union representation. They didn't want to rock the boat.
But there's a lot of power on the side of workers these days. I think it's possible workers in the South say: We're making $ 22 an hour. The workers in Detroit are making $ 32 an hour. We should be in the union.
As an auto industry reporter, are you a big car guy?
It's funny, I'm not. I'm interested in cars, but I'm not a big car person. I drive a Chevy Malibu, believe it or not.
Cars are interesting products to cover. There's no other country in the world where there are as many pop songs and movies about cars. The Beach Boys' "409"; that David Hasselhoff TV show, "Knight Rider." It's a whole TV show built around a car.
There are good stories in Detroit. Sometimes it's a matter of explaining things to readers. We did a lot of that in the past year on the transition to E.V.s. There are also really interesting personalities to write about. That's what keeps me going.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Giant new oil and gas wells that require astonishing volumes of water to fracture bedrock are threatening America's fragile aquifers.
Increasingly complex oil wells are sweeping across Texas, birthplace of the fracking revolution, and the nation.
A Times analysis found that these new wells can consume millions of gallons of water, often taken from dwindling aquifers.
To satisfy that thirst, energy giants are drilling not just for oil, but for the water they need.
Nationwide, fracking has used up nearly 1.5 trillion gallons of water since 2011. That's how much tap water the entire state of Texas uses in a year.
Along a parched stretch of La Salle County, Texas, workers last year dug some 700 feet deep into the ground, seeking freshwater. Millions of gallons of it.
The water wouldn't supply homes or irrigate farms. It was being used by the petroleum giant BP to frack for fossil fuels. The water would be mixed with sand and toxic chemicals and pumped right back underground -- forcing oil and gas from the bedrock.
It was a reminder that to strike oil in America, you need water. Plenty of it.
Today, the insatiable search for oil and gas has become the latest threat to the country's endangered aquifers, a critical national resource that is already being drained at alarming rates by industrial farming and cities in search of drinking water.
The amount of water consumed by the oil industry, revealed in a New York Times investigation, has soared to record levels. Fracking wells have increased their water usage sevenfold since 2011 as operators have adopted new techniques to first drill downward and then horizontally for thousands of feet. The process extracts more fossil fuels but requires enormous amounts of water.
Together, oil and gas operators reported using about 1.5 trillion gallons of water since 2011, much of it from aquifers, the Times found. Fracking a single oil or gas well can now use as much as 40 million gallons of water or more.
These mega fracking projects, called "monster fracks" by researchers, have become the industry norm. They barely existed a decade ago. Now they account for almost two out of every three fracking wells in Texas, the Times analysis found.
"They're the newcomers, a new sector that burst onto the scene and is heavily reliant on the aquifers," said Peter Knappett, an associate professor in hydrogeology at Texas A&M University, referring to fracking companies. "And they could be pumping for several decades from aquifers that are already over-exploited and already experiencing long-term declines."
Fracking, which is shorthand for hydraulic fracturing, has transformed the global energy landscape, turning America into the world's largest oil and gas producer, surpassing Saudi Arabia. Supporters say it has strengthened America's national security and created valuable jobs.
But fracking has long been controversial. The process of cracking the bedrock by injecting chemical-laced water into the ground can lead to spills and leaks and can affect the local geology, sometimes contributing to earthquakes. Critics of fracking say it is an irony that so much water is being diverted to produce fossil fuels, given that the burning of fossil fuels is causing climate change, further straining freshwater resources.
The Times documented the surging water usage by examining an industry database in which energy companies report the chemicals they pump into the ground while fracking. But the database also includes details on their water usage, revealing the dramatic growth.
The problem is particularly acute in Texas, where the state's groundwater supply is expected to drop one-third by 2070. As the planet warms, scientists have predicted that Texas will face higher temperatures and more frequent and intense droughts, along with a decline in groundwater recharge. Some experts have warned that water issues could even constrain oil and gas production.
In the western portion of the Eagle Ford, one of the state's major oil-producing regions, aquifer levels have fallen by up to 58 feet a year, a 2020 study by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin found, and fracking's water demands could result in further regional declines of up to 26 feet.
Since 2011, BP has dug at least 137 groundwater wells in Texas for its oil and gas operations and reported using 9.1 billion gallons of water nationally during the past decade. EOG, one of the country's largest frackers, consumed more than 73 billion gallons of water for fracking at the same time. Apache Corporation, Southwestern Energy, Chevron, Ovintiv and other major operators also have intensified water usage, the Times analysis found.
Oil companies require no permits to drill their own groundwater wells and there is no consistent requirement that groundwater used for fracking be reported or monitored. As drought has gripped Texas and the surrounding region, many communities have instituted water restrictions for residents even as fracking has been allowed to continue unabated.
Pockets of public resistance are emerging. In New Mexico, a coalition of tribes and environmental groups is suing the state, saying that fracking companies are using up precious water resources and that the state has failed to protect the interests of residents. In Colorado, residents are fighting a proposed fracking project they fear would not just use up local freshwater resources, but risk contaminating a reservoir their community depends on.
Holly Hopkins, an executive at the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said the industry was "focused on meeting the growing demand for affordable, reliable energy while minimizing impacts on the environment." Its members, she said, were "continuing to develop innovative methods to reuse and recycle" water used for fracking.
In a statement, Apache said 80 percent of the water it used for fracking was either non-fresh or recycled from previous fracks. BP said it was "executing several pilot projects to recycle water" that would "minimize freshwater usage."
Chevron said that water was vital to its operations and that it aimed to use water efficiently and responsibly, saying that it used brackish or recycled water for fracking. Southwestern and Ovintiv did not respond to requests for comment.
In La Salle County -- where workers were drilling the water well last year that would supply BP -- the local aquifers have already been strained by decades of pumping to feed crops and cattle. The local groundwater district, Wintergarten, estimates that fracking's water needs could surpass those of irrigation by 2030 (though the oil industry's notorious boom-and-bust cycles could change that).
Despite the new demand, Wintergarten has little say over the use of water for fracking.
According to its rules, when "moderate" or "severe" droughts occur, people should stop washing their cars and restaurants should refrain from serving glasses of water unless a customer asks. But only during "exceptional" droughts do the rules extend to fracking, and even then they merely discourage it.
Similarly in Laredo, a city on the Mexican border that recently imposed water restrictions, residents may water their lawns only three days a week, and only at night. Laredo, which in recent years has become fracking territory, is facing an impending water shortage: By 2040, it's expected to exhaust the available supply of municipal water from the Rio Grande allocated to the city every year. Still, even during severe drought, fracking is excluded from city or state restrictions.
"This is Texas. If you're using water for oil and gas, it's considered exempt," said Ronald T. Green, a hydrologist who advises Wintergarten. So when fracking plans collide with drought, Dr. Green said, "you just have to hope that if they're a good, community-oriented company, they might decide not to frack that well till next year."
It's happening, of course, because there is money to be made in oil. And for those with access to water, it can be easy money.
Bruce Frasier grows onions in Dimmit, one of the three counties that make up the Wintergarten water district. But he also sells groundwater to a local fracking company for 50 cents a barrel. Given the growing size of fracks, "If you've got the water to sell, you're making a fortune," Mr. Frasier said.
The 'Horizontal' Frack
Wintergarten. Evergreen. Big Springs.
The place names that dot Texas's parched plains hark back to a time more than a century ago when groundwater was plentiful.
"Back in those days, you could just dig, and the water would flow," said Bill Martin, a rancher and farmer who heads the Wintergarten Groundwater Conservation District, as he walked his land during a recent heat wave, his boots kicking up dust under a scorching sun.
But that water, sometimes called fossil water because scientists estimate that it pooled underground as long as 30,000 years ago, started to dry up as farms irrigated vast tracts of land. Farms that couldn't afford to drill ever deeper started to plant less or shut down.
Today, much of America's oil and gas comes from parched land like this. And now, fracking companies are the ones scrambling for water. A 2016 Ceres report found that nearly 60 percent of the 110,000 wells fracked between 2011 and 2016 were in regions with high or extremely high water stress, including basins in Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, and California.
This is partly because of the increasing complexity and size of fracked wells. For example one technique, horizontal drilling, involves wells that stretch thousands of feet sideways, not just downward. In the Permian Basin, average well length grew to more than 10,000 feet in the first nine months of 2022, compared with less than 4,000 feet in 2010, federal data shows.
It is because water is so fundamental to fracking that the longer wells typically require far more water.
"As the easier-to-extract areas are tapped to their full potential, you need to use more and more desperate measures," said A.J. Kondash, an environmental scientist at RTI International, a nonprofit research organization, who has studied fracking's water use.
The problem is actually two-fold. Fracking companies are pulling more water out of the ground, and then, after the fracking process, they must treat or dispose of millions of gallons of contaminated water, removing it from the natural water cycle.
Some companies are making strides in reusing that fracking wastewater to drill for more oil and gas, but it's a small percentage. In the sprawling Permian Basin in Texas, the largest oil field in the country, just 15 percent of water used for fracking is recycled water, according to state estimates.
The Times based its water-use analysis on data from FracFocus, a registry of chemicals used in fracking that is operated by two national associations of state agencies, the Groundwater Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission. In 27 states, companies report the data to FracFocus.
That data revealed surging water use even though the numbers, which are self-reported by industry, are sometimes incomplete.
Dan Yates, executive director of the Groundwater Protection Council, pointed out that the two agencies that run FracFocus have no regulatory authority. The onus is on individual states, he said, to make sure operators disclose timely and accurate data.
Rystad Energy, an energy research company, estimated that about 6 to 9 percent of fracked wells don't get reported to FracFocus.
Of course, water use by energy industries isn't limited to fracking. Water is important in oil refining and the cooling of power plants, and also plays a role in the mining of lithium and other minerals essential in the transition to cleaner energy.
Oil companies say the industry uses substantial amounts of brackish water not suitable for drinking, though there is little systematic tracking of how much. They also say that drilling fewer, longer wells reduces environmental disruption at ground level.
Industry groups also stress that oil and gas production uses a small fraction of the water required by other activities, like irrigated agriculture.
But researchers at Colorado State University who compared water used for fracking in oil- and gas-producing states between 2011 and 2020 found that, under arid conditions, frackers could use more water than irrigation. In La Salle for instance, under arid conditions, fracking used more water than irrigation and local homes and businesses combined. Fracking activity, they found, responded to oil prices, and seemed largely unresponsive to droughts or water restrictions.
Compounding the problem, about a quarter of Texas operates under rules that let landowners to pump as much water on their property as they like, regardless of consequences to neighbors.
"In Texas, if you own the surface, you own everything to the center of the earth," said Mr. Martin of the Wintergarten water district.
The Hunt for Water
The letter from an oil company arrived for Mario Atencio's family in 2013, promising riches in exchange for a lease to drill near their home in northwestern New Mexico.
Then, Enduring Resources, the Denver-based oil and gas company that ultimately acquired the lease, started to drill.
Workers dug a water well near the area where his family raises livestock, tapping into the groundwater that had long sustained the grazing land the Atencios use to raise goats and sheep. "They came in and they put in water pipelines. Huge pools filled with water," Mr. Atencio said. "We thought, 'Is this our water? How much water are they tapping?"'
Mr. Atencio, a leader in the local Navajo Nation Chapter, is now part of the coalition of tribes and environmental organizations that in May sued New Mexico alleging that the state had failed to protect its residents from the harms of fracking.
A substantial portion of their complaint focuses on the strain that oil and gas development places on freshwater in New Mexico, one of the nation's most water-stressed states.
"We're facing some of the worst years of drought in the last 1,200 years," said Julia Bernal of the Pueblo Action Alliance, an Indigenous organization that is a party to the lawsuit. Yet energy companies were building water pipelines to serve fracking sites, she said. "There are a lot of families that live in the region that don't have access to running water."
New Mexico said it "vigorously disagrees" with the lawsuit's allegations and was proud of its work regulating oil and gas. Enduring Resources didn't respond to requests for comment.
Across the country, investments like these in water for oil and gas -- wells, pipelines and even water distribution companies -- are extensive and spreading.
In Colorado, the energy exploration companies Anadarko and Noble Energy have invested tens of millions of dollars in freshwater pipelines and have created companies to sell and distribute water for fracking. In 2020, Chevron acquired Noble Energy, together with its water business, in a transaction worth more than $ 13 billion.
When Kevin Chan moved to Colorado from California last year, to a neighborhood on the banks of the Aurora Reservoir, he said he was surprised to learn that more than 150 horizontal fracked wells were planned in the region around the reservoir. The wells would potentially require a total of 3.9 billion gallons of freshwater from a local water district and other sources, according to the energy company behind the project, Denver-based Civitas.
Concerned about the water use and risk of oil spills, he formed a community group, Save the Aurora Reservoir, to oppose the plan. In moving to Colorado, "I was drawn to the proximity to the mountains, being able to go snowboarding," Mr. Chan said. "I didn't expect to go up against a multibillion dollar industry."
Rich Coolidge, a spokesman for Civitas, said several thousand feet of rock separated the Aurora reservoir from oil and gas production. He said the company was working with local water providers that sell surplus supply, but declined to give details.
Some local governments are starting to take action. In 2020, New Mexico halted sales of water supplies to oil and gas companies fracking on state land. This year, Colorado passed a bill requiring frackers to greatly increase their reuse of fracking wastewater. In May, Texas passed a bill designed to find more uses for fracking wastewater.
But cleaning up that wastewater, which contains hazardous chemicals, is costly and energy-intensive. Even if frackers were able to re-use their treated wastewater for all their production, the industry estimates it would still generate hundreds of millions of gallons of excess every day. And the diversion of fracking wastewater to other uses, whether for agriculture or to mist roadways in order to keep down the dust, remains contentious because of safety concerns.
So, in states like Texas, it remains cheaper to use groundwater.
Mr. Martin, the rancher and farmer who heads the Wintergarten water district, doesn't fault energy companies for that. He himself irrigates his cantaloupe fields using groundwater.
Still, as he contemplated a future of ever-dwindling aquifers, he struck a somber tone. "If the water goes away, the whole community goes away," he said.

Lawsuit Against Fossil Fuels Mirrors Strategy Used to Take On Big Tobacco: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: California's lawsuit against oil giants mirrors a legal strategy used in the 1990s against the tobacco industry.
California is taking some of the world's biggest energy companies, including Shell, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, to court, accusing them of concealing the damage caused by fossil fuels on the state for more than half a century. The state's lawsuit is the most significant attempt to take on Big Oil over its role in climate change, as the energy majors report bumper profits and oil nears $ 100 a barrel.
The strategy has echoes of an earlier fight: states' legal battle against Big Tobacco in the 1990s.
California wants the companies to cover costs of fighting wildfires and mitigating the effects of dense smog. It argues that the oil majors should pay fines for burying scientific evidence linking carbon emissions to greenhouse gases. "It's time they pay to abate the harm they have caused," Rob Bonta, California's attorney general, said in a statement.
The American Petroleum Institute, the industry lobbying group also named in the case, called the suit "meritless" and "an enormous waste of California taxpayer resources."
California is reopening a playbook it used to take on Big Tobacco. In the 1990s, California and dozens of other states brought cases against the four biggest U.S. tobacco companies. Prosecutors proved that the companies had concealed evidence linking smoking to cancer, winning a payout of more than $ 360 billion over 25 years. The companies were also compelled to label cigarettes as potentially lethal, to change how and where they marketed them, and to disband the Tobacco Institute, the industry-funded trade group.
There are historic links and echoes between the behavior of Big Tobacco and Big Oil. In the 1950s and 1960s, oil companies helped the tobacco industry test poisons in cigarettes. And then there was a 1968 report commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute and conducted by the Stanford Research Institute. It detailed how fossil fuels caused climate change but was never widely distributed, said Carroll Muffett, C.E.O. and president of the Center for International Environmental Law, who has studied the links between the two industries.
Collective action worked. For years, individual plaintiffs had repeatedly lost lawsuits to Big Tobacco. "It was only when the states as litigators got involved that the landscape changed dramatically," Muffett said, adding that "you had litigators who had the resources and patience to stay in litigation as long as the companies."
California has outsize political clout as the world's fifth-biggest economy and a major oil producer. It has used that power to, for example, shape quasi-national policy on reducing auto emissions. And this month, the State Legislature passed a bill that would force big companies to detail their carbon emissions -- a first by a U.S. state and a leap ahead of the Securities Exchange Commission, which is drafting its own climate disclosure rules for companies to follow.
The oil majors face lawsuits elsewhere. Cases in the Netherlands, Britain, France and Italy argue that the industry bears some responsibility for climate change, and similar litigation is underway in New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. "The diversity of claimants is growing apace," said Paul Benson of ClientEarth, an environmental law organization in London, who led a lawsuit against Shell's board this year alleging that the company wasn't reining in carbon emissions fast enough.
Victory is far from certain. Prosecutors could face a tougher task proving oil companies' climate culpability than their predecessors did linking smoking to harmful health effects. In July, a British judge blocked ClientEarth from proceeding with its case against Shell, saying courts should not interfere with corporate strategy; the organization is appealing the decision.
Others could join the fight now that California is involved. With tobacco, smaller states launched their own lawsuits after an initial action filed by Florida. "Once the litigation against the tobacco industry began, it never ended," Muffett said. -- Vivienne Walt
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
The U.A.W. widens its strike. One week after 13,000 workers walked off assembly lines at three plants owned by the Big Three Detroit automakers, the United Automobile Workers expanded its walkouts on Friday to 38 spare-parts distribution centers at General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Jeep and Ram. The union said it was not striking more facilities at Ford Motor because of the gains it had achieved in talks with that company.
Rupert Murdoch announces his retirement. The 92-year-old media tycoon will become chairman emeritus of Fox and News Corporation and named Lachlan, his elder son, as heir. But he isn't about to disappear: He remains the majority shareholder of a family trust that owns significant stakes in each business.
The Fed forecasts higher rates. Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, said the central bank would keep interest rates on hold at its meeting this past week, but stayed open to another increase this year. The decision, along with the Fed's roundly optimistic economic forecasts, suggests that officials see a better chance of a "soft landing" for the economy, with higher rates neither crashing the labor market nor pushing the United States into a recession.
FTX sues Sam Bankman-Fried's parents. Lawyers for the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange accused Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, two longtime Stanford law professors, of enriching themselves with money that their son, FTX's founder, stole from customers. Lawyers for Bankman and Fried have called FTX's claims "completely false" and "a dangerous attempt" to "undermine the jury process just days before their child's trial begins."
A college sports giant pulls off an unlikely deal
Over five decades, Learfield Communications has built itself into one of the biggest players in the business of college sports. The company, which assembles deals for audio streaming and in-stadium advertising and runs ticketing, among other services, racked up debt in large part to expand through acquisitions. Most recently, Learfield merged with its top rival, IMG College, to create a behemoth that works with nearly 200 Division I schools and conferences.
That aggressive deal-making, along with unprofitable rights contracts with five schools including U.C.L.A. and Florida State, landed the billion-dollar business in big trouble after the pandemic shut down college sports: With $ 1.1 billion in debt coming due this year, Learfield faced a potential bankruptcy.
To avoid that fate, it pulled off an unconventional maneuver that involved getting 100 percent of its creditors on board with a restructuring plan.
Learfield feared that bankruptcy would damage its reputation with colleges, and its chief executive, Cole Gahagan, pushed back against advisers' suggestion that the company at least threaten a Chapter 11 filing to win concessions. "The notion of something in the courts was never something we had talked about doing," he told DealBook.
Months of tough negotiations followed. The existing owners, including the entertainment giant Endeavor, agreed to give up nearly all their stakes. Dozens of creditors were jawboned into converting the debt they were owed into equity stakes in Learfield. And over two weeks, Gahagan flew across the United States to the five schools whose contracts needed reworking, pleading with them to exchange guaranteed payouts for revenue-sharing deals. (Some schools were given the chance to look elsewhere for contracts with better terms.)
Part of the pitch to creditors, Gahagan said, was that Learfield would capitalize on changes in the college sports business. Its fastest-growing business is endorsement deals, which the N.C.A.A. began to allow for student athletes and their schools in 2021.
Throughout, advisers worried that the plan would fail. Not threatening bankruptcy might have emboldened creditors to hold out for better terms, and restructuring deals negotiated outside court requires every lender to sign on. (Filing for bankruptcy after getting a majority of creditors on board allows companies to force a deal onto the others.)
Learfield got 93 percent of creditors on board by late summer. It wasn't until days before nearly $ 150 million in debt was coming due in September that Learfield secured 100 percent approval for its plan: Creditors agreed to wipe out $ 600 million of the company's debt and convert their holdings into ownership stakes, while putting in $ 150 million in new money.
Anup Sathy, Learfield's lead outside restructuring lawyer, told Gahagan that the company's highly unorthodox approach had made him rethink his tactics. Gahagan laughed and responded, "I wasn't trying to make history, dude."
Beer-flation, Bavarian style
Revelers have converged on Munich for Oktoberfest, and inflation is again the loaded topic. The cost of a liter of Bavarian beer served at the annual festival has soared, a decades-long trend that has grown more acute during the current cost-of-living crisis.
The price of a liter -- or "mass," as it's called locally -- is eye-watering. It ranges from 12.60 euros to €14.90 (about $ 13.40 to $ 15.90), according to organizers in the German city, or 6.1 percent more than last year. The most pricey: A liter of weissbier at the Weinzelt tent spills over at €17.40 (about $ 18.50).
The beer-flation is enough to "make some crave a stiffer drink to drown the financial pain," wrote Holger Schmieding, the chief economist at Berenberg, in a research note examining Oktoberfest prices. (Schmieding coined "fun-flation" this summer to describe how consumer splurging on expensive meals, concerts and through-the-roof airfare affected prices.)
The stein-half-full take for Oktoberfest: German wages have risen, on average, 6.6 percent in the past year, outpacing beer prices. "For the first time in decades, beer at the Oktoberfest is becoming slightly more affordable in real terms for most Germans," Schmieding wrote.

Full text: Who would have guessed that the former New York media obsession Julia Allison and the law scholar Noah Feldman would make a great couple?
One afternoon in May 2020, Julia Allison sat in a hot spring near Joshua Tree National Park, crying. A media strategist and tech-world socialite -- who in her former life as a New York City journalist and media personality pioneered the sort of internet-driven microfame that we now call "influencing" -- Ms. Allison was going through yet another breakup. She wanted to know: What was the point of it all?
"This was not the plan," she remembered thinking. "Thirty-nine and single. What has my life come to?"
Then Ms. Allison had an unusual epiphany, even for Joshua Tree: She needed to consult the Felix Frankfurter professor of law at Harvard Law School, Noah Feldman.
Like Ms. Allison, Mr. Feldman first rose to prominence in Lower Manhattan in the aughts, as a wunderkind constitutional law scholar at N.Y.U. (In 2003, at 33, he advised the Iraqis in writing their Constitution after the U.S. invasion.) Also like Ms. Allison, Mr. Feldman had been unlucky in love, a bachelor since his 2011 divorce.
The two had never talked, but a mutual friend had described Mr. Feldman to Ms. Allison as "the world's most fascinating man." Through the friend, she had Mr. Feldman's number, which she dialed from the hot spring. He picked up, and Ms. Allison asked him the meaning of life. They spoke for 90 minutes.
"Neither of us can remember what Noah said, but I know it was so profound," Ms. Allison said.
Now, three and a half years later, after a courtship that has been, while not precisely a secret, at least conspicuously discreet, Ms. Allison and Mr. Feldman are engaged.
On the surface, it was an unlikely match. Ms. Allison, 42, is a 10-time Burning Man attendee who had lived in California for a decade; her friends include start-up chief executives and psychedelic psychotherapists; she considers Bali her spiritual home. Ms. Allison described a period of her dating history as "10 years of relationships with polyamorous D.J.s." (Ms. Allison said she also dated the former Democratic congressman Harold Ford Jr. when she was a college student at Georgetown.)
Mr. Feldman, meanwhile, embodies the East Coast establishment. The son of an M.I.T. professor and a Harvard lecturer who graduated first in his class from Harvard, Mr. Feldman, 53, speaks five languages, has written nine books and is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion. (Mr. Feldman has also been a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine.) His first wife, Jeannie Suk Gersen, with whom he has two teenage children, is also a professor at Harvard Law School and a public intellectual.
"People I dated seriously, subsequently, were people of substance," Mr. Feldman said in a recent interview in his office. "Distinguished in their professions."
Ms. Allison, sitting arm in arm with Mr. Feldman, smiled.
"Serious people," she said in a stage whisper.
But Ms. Allison's call came at a time, early in Covid restrictions, when Mr. Feldman -- then nearing 50, teaching remotely and spending much of his time alone at home -- was questioning the basics of human connection.
"I was not at an optimistic point in my romantic life," he said. He remembered wondering, "Will anyone ever meet any human ever again?"
The pair said they spoke every day for three months after that first call, often for hours at a time. Mr. Feldman invited Ms. Allison to Maine, where he owns a home.
It took some convincing. Ms. Allison was ambivalent about a bicoastal romance, and about the East Coast in general. Though she felt their chemistry was obvious, she was committed to California. Ms. Allison had moved there after a half decade in the late 2000s in which she became a recurring character in the New York gossip pages and was profiled by The Times as a kind of neo-Candace Bushnell -- a dating columnist whom people both loved and loved to hate. An attention economy savant, Ms. Allison was perhaps best known as a foil for Gawker, which obsessively, and sneeringly, covered her social life. In exchange, she gained a kind of toxic fame, both hyperlocal and completely global thanks to the internet, which was a harbinger of the culture to come.
"She was too early," said Taylor Lorenz, the Washington Post tech columnist and chronicler of social media influence. "She predicted it all."
Scarred by the experience, Ms. Allison has been living mostly out of the spotlight ever since. Early in their phone calls, she asked Mr. Feldman not to Google her.
"It's not a representation of who I even was then, let alone now," Ms. Allison said.
But eventually, she got on a plane. At the Portland airport, from his car, Mr. Feldman caught sight of Ms. Allison for the first time.
"I saw Julia dancing, alone, in a sundress on this tiny little triangle of grass in the middle of the airport," he said. "It was a beautiful, moving image of somebody who was sourcing joy entirely internally."
They spent five days together, picking out produce at the farmers' market, lying in the grass, and, as Ms. Allison put it, "kissing on Noah's boat."
"I was completely magnetized by this man," she said.
Still, there was an acculturation process -- particularly for Mr. Feldman, who is not really the dance-like-no-one-is-watching type. To begin with, Ms. Allison was immersed in a scene, centered on Burning Man, about which Mr. Feldman knew nothing.
"Many of Julia's friends have jobs I didn't know existed until I met Julia," Mr. Feldman said. "One is a fire dancer. She also has a friend named Purple -- he only wears purple, and his métier is bodywork."
"Noah is learning how to have fun," Ms. Allison said. "But he's a fast learner."
Ms. Allison took Mr. Feldman on several pilgrimages -- acid tests, really -- to make sure he could loosen up. First the pair went to the Indonesian island of Bali, where Ms. Allison lived for a year from 2017 to 2018 doing what she referred to as a "yoga and meditation sabbatical," and which she said she paid for with earnings from her investments in cryptocurrency. (Mr. Feldman was familiar with the island in part through the work of the anthropologist Clifford Geertz, who wrote about the social dynamics at play in Balinese cockfighting.) Mr. Feldman was tense at first, but cycling the village roads north of Ubud, he began to feel himself pleasantly removed from the rigidly intellectual culture of Cambridge, Mass.
"It may be as far away as you can go from Boston," he said.
Next, in the fall of 2022, came the final exam: Burning Man, the weeklong event where tens of thousands of people gather to camp and revel in the Nevada desert, and worldly accomplishments aren't supposed to matter.
"To say Noah was having trepidation about Burning Man would be a major understatement," Ms. Allison said. "He understood it was a requirement. If you're going to be with me, you have to go to Burning Man. He was vibrating with anxiety."
There, it was Ms. Allison's turn to behold Mr. Feldman. The law professor had agreed to M.C. some events for Ms. Allison's camp, which she described as a "matriarchy." One session featured a woman in a large headdress leading the audience in a mind-body therapy that involved rapidly tapping certain points on the body. As Ms. Allison entered the tent, she saw Mr. Feldman in front of the crowd, tapping himself and repeating the mantra, "I love and accept myself unconditionally."
"It was the best moment of my life," she said.
Still, for all the changes Mr. Feldman has made, it was Ms. Allison who agreed to pull up stakes. She moved to Cambridge in November of 2021, and last month, she began a master's program at the Harvard Kennedy School. She said she hoped to work on issues that matter to her: environmental justice, gender issues and animal rights.
Because of her course load, she missed Burning Man this year for the first time in a decade -- possibly a sign of kismet in and of itself.
And she has moved into Mr. Feldman's 5,000-square-foot mansard-roofed home, which she has, with her fiancé's intermittently enthusiastic participation, redecorated.
"It was a sad, beige house for a sad, beige bachelor," she said.
Ms. Allison's changes include whimsical pink wallpaper with a pattern of monkeys and leopards; thick velvet drapes; Balinese statuary; antique chandeliers throughout the house; and a formidably deep, blue velvet couch in the living room, intended to encourage a kind of sensuous lazing that is not typically associated with Cambridge.
Now, Ms. Allison calls the house "the Bohemian Embassy," and she sends guests a mission statement ahead of time. "Our home is more than dwelling," the message reads. "It is a confluence of diverse minds and spirits, a space of exploration and enlightenment." Ms. Allison hopes to turn the house into a place where the free-spirited sensibility of Burning Man can mix with the cerebral culture of Cambridge.
"Noah is a sharp edge that needs to be softened; he is a square that needs to be rounded," Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, said of his longtime friend. (The two have been close since they were Rhodes scholars together at the University of Oxford.)
"This woman is a gift to him, a guy who has been walking a narrow pathway toward extraordinary success all his life," he continued. "And she was on the side of the road in this wondrous field, filled with wildflowers, and she got him off the path, to dance."
On a recent, humid August evening, the couple hosted a Shabbat dinner to put those hopes into practice. (Mr. Feldman, who is working on a book about the nature of contemporary Judaism, grew up modern Orthodox. Ms. Allison said that she planned to "join Judaism.") The guest list featured friends of Ms. Allison's -- among them a professional intimacy coach, an entrepreneur who built a high-tech chair for meditation and a professional relationship coach -- as well as two friends of Mr. Feldman's, a physicist and a sociologist.
After a dinner of plank-grilled salmon, prepared by Mr. Feldman, and several glasses of Pouilly-Fuissé, the group retired to the living room. Mr. Feldman, wearing a rakishly unbuttoned pink oxford shirt, reclined on the sofa, where the meditation chair entrepreneur draped her legs across his lap. (Ms. Allison's Burning Man friends place a premium on physical touch and soft surfaces, a phenomenon they refer to as "bringing the squish.")
Ms. Allison sat on her heels on the floor in front of them, her full-length pink floral dress gathered around her. Topics of conversation included the potential for MDMA to treat trauma, the 19th-century German sociologist Max Weber and the nature of love.
Starielle Hope, the intimacy coach, said that at first she had been skeptical about the match.
"To me they were so different," she said. "He is a man who is part of a hierarchical system, and she is a woman who is seeking an unconventional life in balmy climates."
Ms. Allison laughed. "These two worlds could do so much together," she said.
The physicist, reclining in an oxblood Eames lounge chair, offered that the hippies had saved physics, to murmurs of assent. As the evening progressed, he performed sleight of hand.
This summer, Mr. Feldman and Ms. Allison went on a four-country trip to Europe to scout wedding locations. But the couple hasn't yet set a date. Ms. Allison said that she was simply too busy with school to properly focus on the wedding she envisions.
"I have to plan an event worthy of waiting until 42 to get married," she said.

Are 'Good Jobs' Coming Back?: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Are the United Auto Workers justified in seeking higher wages and benefits? Definitely. Is the union overreaching? I don't know -- partly because I'm not an expert on auto industry economics, partly because the actual agreement, when it comes, may be more modest in scope than the union's current bargaining position.
Still, I think it's important to understand the context. Both Donald Trump and now Joe Biden promised to revitalize U.S. manufacturing. Trump, with his chaotic trade war, didn't deliver on his promise. Biden, with his embrace of industrial policy, seems to be having more success, although we don't yet know how many manufacturing jobs will be created by the surge in manufacturing construction currently underway.
But why should creating more manufacturing jobs be a policy goal? A large part of the answer is the widespread perception that manufacturing jobs are good jobs -- jobs that pay well and come with good benefits.
Yet that isn't necessarily the case. Manufacturing jobs aren't inherently better than jobs in other sectors. True, there was a long period -- basically from Franklin Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan -- when manufacturing jobs were, in fact, good jobs. Nostalgia for this period is part of the reason Trump's slogan "Make America Great Again" got traction with blue-collar voters. But those relatively high wages in manufacturing didn't just happen: They were negotiated by unions, which were much more powerful in manufacturing than in the rest of the economy. When the power of the unions went away, so did the manufacturing wage premium.
So one way to think about the autoworkers' strike is that it's an attempt to make manufacturing good again.
Let's start with the history. We don't have all the data we'd like for long-run comparisons -- in particular, we don't have good data outside of manufacturing before the 1960s. But there's little reason to believe that manufacturing jobs were particularly good jobs before the New Deal.
There were exceptions. In 1914 Henry Ford famously doubled his workers' wages to $ 5 a day, which was a lot at the time. His goal was to make boring, repetitive jobs desirable, and hence raise workers' efficiency, and he seems to have succeeded in doing so. But many, probably most, workers in U.S. manufacturing continued to receive low wages while working long hours.
The big change came in the 1930s and 1940s. Here's a chart showing real manufacturing wages -- the average hourly wage for production workers divided by the Consumer Price Index -- from 1919 to 1995:
Notice the steep rise from the late 1930s to the mid-1940s. This corresponds to what Claudia Goldin and Robert Margo call the Great Compression, the sudden reduction in wage inequality that took place mainly during World War II and created the middle-class society I grew up in and that politicians on both the right and the left keep promising to restore.
But simply bringing manufacturing jobs back wouldn't accomplish that restoration. As you can also see in the chart above, real wages in manufacturing have in general been declining since 1980. The decline has been especially pronounced and persistent in auto manufacturing; here's a chart that tracks that decline since 1990:
Why did manufacturing jobs get good in the 1940s, then stop being good in recent decades? The answer, almost surely, lies mainly in the rise and decline of unions. Unionization rates surged in the favorable political environment of the New Deal, then withered in the unfavorable environment of post-Reagan America; union power declined even more. Since both unionization rates and union power were stronger at their peak in manufacturing than they were elsewhere, unions were what made manufacturing jobs good.
That diagnosis is upheld by a 2022 paper by researchers at the Federal Reserve Board. Kimberly Bayard, Tomaz Cajner, Vivi Gregorich and Maria D. Tito find that the manufacturing wage premium -- the difference between wage rates in manufacturing and elsewhere, once you adjust for differences in worker characteristics -- was substantial in the 1980s, but has now disappeared. And they argue that this decline was caused by a sharp drop in unionization, which was initially higher in manufacturing than in other sectors:
This decline in unionization didn't just reduce the number of workers benefiting from union wages. It also greatly reduced the ability of unions to negotiate higher wages for their workers, so the union wage premium itself fell too:
And the combined effect of fewer unionized workers and a lower union premium, they find, accounts for the bulk of the decline in the premium for manufacturing workers in general.
So what does this say about the current situation? While the Biden administration's policies may produce a partial revival of manufacturing employment (no, we're not going back to the days when manufacturing was a third of nonfarm employment), the newly created jobs won't necessarily be especially good jobs.
This doesn't mean that a manufacturing revival would achieve nothing: It looks likely that many of the jobs Biden's polices will create will be in depressed regions of the United States, where any jobs will be welcome. But the new jobs will be good jobs only if the partial revival of manufacturing is accompanied by a restoration of worker bargaining power.
And here's the thing: There's no reason a union revival must be restricted to manufacturing. The centrality of manufacturing to the union movement in America was, in a way, a historical accident. Back when favorable political conditions allowed unions to thrive, manufacturing contained most of the big companies you might want to organize. As America increasingly became a service economy, you might have expected unionization to spread to other sectors, as it did in Nordic countries, where two-thirds of workers are still unionized. But America's shift away from manufacturing -- during which Walmart displaced General Motors as the biggest private-sector employer -- took place in a political environment that was hostile to union organizing.
So if the autoworkers get major gains as a result of their strike, the lesson you take shouldn't be that we can make manufacturing jobs good again. It will, instead, be that we can make jobs in general better by helping workers make better bargains.

James Dolan's Moonshot: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Rosman, Katherine

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In his 26th-floor office, high above Midtown Manhattan, James L. Dolan sits on a white couch by a large desk and armoire decorated with family photographs, with an electric guitar on a stand in the corner. His eyes are trained on a wall-mounted surveillance screen.
Mr. Dolan, 68, oversees a family empire that includes some of New York's most famous brands, including Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall, the Knicks and the Rangers. At the epicenter of professional sports, marquee concerts, politics and real estate, he is one of the most powerful forces in the city. He is also one of New York's most vilified public figures, a punching bag and a punchline.
But New York is not where his brain or his video monitor are focused. Mr. Dolan -- son of Long Island, commander of beloved New York sports teams, and magnet for the type of caustic mockery that only New Yorkers are capable of expressing -- is looking 2,500 miles southwest for respect, redemption and reputational rebirth.
Foremost on his mind, and on the live-feed beamed into his New York office, is his new arena in Las Vegas, an audacious project that he believes could revolutionize the live entertainment industry.
Rising behind the Vegas Strip, the arena, called the Sphere, is an enormous orb wrapped -- inside and out -- with more than 700,000 square feet of programmable video screens. It has the capacity to use sound, vibration and even smells to transport audiences into a virtual reality, no headset required. The Sphere is scheduled to open next week with a series of largely sold-out performances by U2.
The project cost $ 2.3 billion to build, mostly during the pandemic, with the sheer force of Mr. Dolan's legendary stubbornness propelling it to completion, albeit two years late and $ 1 billion over budget.
In this case, Mr. Dolan's aggressive and exacting ways seem to have benefited him and his company. But that is not always so.
He has long carried a reputation as a mercurial and sometimes callous corporate manager -- a grown-up rich kid with the good fortune to have been a son of Charles F. Dolan, who founded HBO and Cablevision, the company that bought its controlling stake in the Garden, the Knicks and the Rangers in 1997.
When the Knicks perform poorly -- as they often have under Mr. Dolan's ownership -- fans excoriate him. Politicians and bureaucrats castigate him for leading a company that enjoys enormous tax benefits while insisting that he will not financially contribute to the renovation of Pennsylvania Station, the rail depot that sits dank and dark beneath the Garden. He is entangled in a protracted public fight with a revered athlete, and uses facial recognition technology to ban from his venues people whom he says are adversarial toward him. Fans holding signs that say "Sell the Team" risk being booted because, Mr. Dolan said, they violate a code of conduct barring the harassment of the arena's workers, including him. "I am an employee," he said.
This month, with the Sphere set to open, he is approaching one of the most pivotal moments of his professional life. "The entire thing is a huge bet," he said. In interviews, those closest to him stressed that the Sphere is wholly a Jim Dolan creation, a big gamble that places him outside of his father's shadow and, perhaps for the first time, without the benefit of the safety net that owning some of New York's most beloved institutions has provided.
"This is something he has done," said Joe Lhota, a former senior Madison Square Garden executive who is on the board of the Sphere's parent company. "It's not something he inherited -- it is him bringing his vision to life. It is totally, 100 percent his vision."
Since the exterior of the Sphere was lit in July, social media has buzzed over the changing digital displays of fireworks, basketballs and even a 360-foot-tall eyeball that can be glimpsed from hotels along the Strip. Once guests experience the immersive visual and sound effects inside, Mr. Dolan believes the Sphere will become a premier venue for music and video productions. He hopes to build replicas around the world.
But the Sphere's success is far from guaranteed. And no matter the excitement over his project in the desert, back home in New York, anger stoked by his perceived highhandedness is bubbling over.
'What Am I Doing?'
Mr. Dolan generally does not enjoy himself at his own venues. He can't relax, can't stop being the domineering boss. It was May, and Mr. Dolan had just arrived at the Beacon Theater, on Manhattan's Upper West Side, where he would take in a Bono show. He entered through the stage door and immediately began demanding information.
"Where is the G.M.?" A man silently motioned at himself, wearing a look of panic.
Mr. Dolan unleashed a torrent of questions about the scaffolding outside. When was it erected? How long would it remain?
"This is not acceptable," he said. "I want a memo on all of this."
It is in this manner -- sweating the details, to the occasional terror of his employees -- that Mr. Dolan set out to build the Sphere.
Back in 2021, he recalled, he stood on scaffolding in Las Vegas more than 100 feet off the ground and beheld the Sphere construction zone. He was temporarily gripped by a feeling that approached panic. "It was the first time I really felt the enormity of the building," he said. "And I looked at it, and I'm like, 'What am I doing?"'
He tried to push through the worry and let it embolden him, as he had seen his father do when he was creating HBO and bringing cable TV to New York and some of its suburbs.
When he saw an opportunity to assert greater control, he grabbed it. Earlier this year, as costs were spiraling and 2,400 people per day were working on-site to ready the Sphere for its scheduled opening, Mr. Dolan fired the project's top executives and took charge -- "Managed it down to the invoice level," he said.
To call the Sphere merely "an arena" is to significantly undersell it. It is a sensory experience inside a globe with 17,600 seats and three football fields' worth of video screens. An "immersive" sound system will ping bespoke audio to your seat, with the potential of serving you dialogue in English, for instance, while the people sitting down the row hear the same presentation in Chinese. Underground pipes will deliver blasts of air that can approximate wind, steam, raindrops or various smells, such as roses, forests or chocolate chip cookies.
Mr. Dolan said the idea began to percolate in 2015, as he was trying to decide how to use more than $ 1 billion in cash and credit that were available to the companies under his control.
He considered expanding his sports portfolio, perhaps by buying a baseball or soccer team. But while the Knicks and Rangers are "near and dear to my heart," he said, "I don't really like owning teams," calling the economics of major league sports "kind of sleepy." He ruled out that option.
He thought about buying more venues, "but the venue business is not a great business," he said.
If a musical act performs at Madison Square Garden, he said, there might be ticket sales of about $ 5 million per night, and the company takes just $ 600,000 or $ 700,000. And there is always a hustle for bookings. Plus, he said, once you own Madison Square Garden, "how are you going to beat that?"
The way to improve the economics of the venue business, he said, is to own the content -- to keep as many aspects of the operation as possible directly under his own control. His inspiration was the "Christmas Spectacular," performed each year by the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall.
In its annual seven-week run, the show "pushes over a million people through the building," he said. "Because we own both sides of the equation, all of the revenue comes to us, and that sustains Radio City Music Hall."
He tried to conceive of a way to do something that took full use of that $ 1 billion and thought of his favorite childhood tale: Ray Bradbury's short story "The Veldt" about a home in which the children's imaginations are beamed onto the walls of their nursery. After the parents express reluctance to let them use the technology, the children lure them into the nursery, which has transformed into an African savanna. "I was impressed by the parents getting eaten by lions," Mr. Dolan said, with dry sarcasm.
He took his germ of an idea -- an arena whose walls were screens that could transport spectators to other milieus -- to David Dibble, a technologist who works for him. Mr. Dolan brought with him a white legal pad with an orb-like arena sketched on it. "Let's reinvent the live entertainment industry," Mr. Dibble recalled him saying.
Crews broke ground in 2018, with an initial anticipated price of about $ 1.2 billion. As costs swelled, Mr. Dolan sold off some assets to help cover expenses and restructured his companies so that investor concerns about the Sphere didn't harm Madison Square Garden Entertainment's stock price.
The Sphere will generate revenue by hosting concerts and events and by selling advertising on the exterior screens. Like at Radio City, it will create its own content, starting with an "immersive production" from the filmmaker Darren Aronofsky called "Postcard From Earth."
Officials in Nevada are eager for the opening. "The Sphere is going to change Las Vegas," said Tick Segerblom, a Clark County commissioner, in whose district the Sphere was erected.
Shareholders appear optimistic too, said Robert Routh, managing director for equity research at FBN Securities.
"It doesn't look like there is as much to worry about as people might have thought," Mr. Routh said, but "there is risk until the thing opens."
'We Don't Want You.'
This is what Mr. Dolan wants to be thinking about: the Sphere and the possibilities of a new, high-tech empire of his own making.
But in New York, he has been mired in controversy over his use of a different technology -- one that identifies attendees at his venues, especially inside the 20,000-seat Garden. He uses facial recognition technology to help bar from entry those he believes to be in violation of the arena's code of conduct and those he simply does not wish to accommodate, particularly lawyers suing him.
To hear Mr. Dolan tell it, there are two types of fans who come to events at Madison Square Garden: those who are there for a good time and those who are "confrontational" and behaving inappropriately, intent on spoiling everyone else's fun. Members of that second group, he believes, should be removed or kept out.
Exactly what counts as inappropriate behavior? In an interview, Mr. Dolan provided this metric:
If an otherwise well-mannered spectator at a Knicks game held a sign overhead urging Mr. Dolan to divest of the Knicks, Mr. Dolan would support their ejection by ushers or security guards. "We don't want you there," Mr. Dolan said.
A Madison Square Garden code of conduct, he said, prohibits attendees from being confrontational with other fans or Garden employees. Signs like "Sell the Team" -- a rallying cry from long disgruntled fans -- are "directed at, on a personal basis, the guy who's in charge -- me." (The code of conduct does not actually say anything about conduct toward employees but does stipulate that "guests shall be respectful of others around them.")
He went on to explain what he considers permissible: "If you held up a sign that says, you know, 'Play better, this team sucks,' you can do that. That's part of being a fan." The reason it is permissible to criticize the team but not the owner, Mr. Dolan said, is because insulting a group is different from insulting one person.
The Garden began using facial recognition technology in 2018 to sort through video footage captured by security cameras at the Garden. If someone complains about an interaction with an usher or says someone else has taken their seat, an image of the person's face can be popped into the facial recognition system "to trace that person's entire experience from camera to camera to camera to camera," Mr. Dolan said.
But it can also be used as a digital bouncer to spot those he wishes to keep out. At the top of that list: lawyers who are suing him or the companies he oversees.
Mr. Dolan said he does not understand why anyone would expect him to be welcoming of "troll attorneys," as he calls them, who are coming after his business interests. It surprises him that lawyers think he would not take it personally. "What do you mean I shouldn't be upset?" he said.
Mr. Dolan's "attorney exclusion list," which he said he conceived of last year, drew widespread criticism after Kelly Conlon, a lawyer from Bergen County, N.J., arrived with her daughter's Girl Scout troop at Radio City Music Hall to see the "Christmas Spectacular," only to be told that she had been spotted by the company's facial recognition technology. Her law firm was representing a client in a slip-and-fall claim against a restaurant group that was at the time owned by a company under Mr. Dolan's control.
She was denied admission, creating an actual Christmas spectacular for the press covering the extraordinary crackdown on the "Girl Scout Mom."
Larry Hutcher, a Knicks fan who bought season tickets for 47 years, learned last October that he, too, was on Madison Square Garden's exclusion list -- in his case because his law firm represented ticket resellers who were suing Madison Square Garden Entertainment. Mr. Hutcher then sued the company for banning him.
Reached by phone this summer, Mr. Hutcher said, "That's what happens when your dad gives you a toy and says, 'Do anything you want with it."'
But after a judge dismissed his clients' suit against Mr. Dolan's company, there was just one thing standing between Mr. Hutcher and his ability to watch his beloved Knicks: the lawsuit against the Garden he had filed because he was banned.
So earlier this month, he dropped it. "I am no longer banned from Madison Square Garden," Mr. Hutcher said, happily.
In essence, Mr. Dolan's tactics had worked.
A Willingness to Fight.
Talk to some of Mr. Dolan's business associates, relatives and close friends, and they will tell you that the short-fused, thin-skinned man portrayed by journalists is not the person they know. Mr. Dolan himself insists that he does not instigate most of the skirmishes that get aired in the press.
"You're running the world's most famous arena, so most of the time the fight comes to you," he said. The "best way to avoid having those kinds of fights," he said, "is to let the other side know you're willing to fight."
As the steward of his business empire, Mr. Dolan said, he considers which battles are in the companies' financial interest and which are important for employee morale.
He considers his notorious fight with Charles Oakley, a beloved former Knicks forward and N.B.A. All-Star, a battle to support his employees. "It's a principle kind of thing," Mr. Dolan said.
In 2017, Mr. Oakley, a vocal critic of Mr. Dolan, was ejected from the Garden during a game between the Knicks and the Los Angeles Clippers. In a spectacle before fans and cameras, a physical altercation broke out between Mr. Oakley and eight security guards and police officers as they tried to remove him.
Mr. Oakley said he was minding his own business when he was swarmed by guards telling him to leave and that they instigated the fracas. Mr. Dolan said that Mr. Oakley was using abusive language and initiated the scuffle with the guards who were responding to his conduct.
The incident, which is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit, remains a source of anger among Knicks fans and has dogged Mr. Dolan for years.
But asked if there was any part of the incident he wishes he could change, he didn't hesitate.
"Yes," he said. "I wish I could change Charles Oakley."
In a brief phone interview, Mr. Oakley reacted with incredulity.
"That's embarrassing for him to say that," he said. "He is the one who should handle himself better."
'Until You're Dead.'
Last spring, as Mr. Dolan was waiting for the Bono show at the Beacon to start, he showed off iPhone photos of one of his grandsons to a reporter and reminisced about taking his children to visit Madison Square Garden when they were young. ("We bought this," he said he told his sons. "Can we buy Universal Studios?" one boy replied.)
As he chatted, a fellow concert goer nervously approached and said, "Let's go Knicks," a cheer for the team during the second round of the playoffs, its best performance in a decade.
Mr. Dolan nodded dismissively, pre-empting further conversation.
Ardent New York sports fans feel a deep interest in his teams that approaches a sort of ownership of its own. This is not Mr. Dolan's vibe. "Basically every fan thinks of themselves as the owner/general manager," he said.
Often, those who approach him to talk about the team -- at public events, at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, at his mother's wake -- offer unsolicited advice.
On handmade posters at the Garden, and in posts on social media, Mr. Dolan is regularly the subject of Knicks fans' personal venom.
"Being a professional sports owner in New York," he said, "you're not beloved until you're dead."
Some athletes who play for Mr. Dolan's teams consider him among the most generous in the league, said Henrik Lundqvist, who played for the Rangers for 15 seasons and now works for Mr. Dolan as a public face of Madison Square Garden. "I saw someone who was fully committed to being sure that we had the best resources and opportunities to succeed," said Mr. Lundqvist, who was recently elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame.
And despite Mr. Dolan's reputation for inserting himself into the running of the Knicks, Leon Rose, the president of the basketball franchise since 2020, said he finds Mr. Dolan invested but not meddlesome. "He places a lot of faith and trust in our basketball operations," he said.
But under Mr. Dolan's control, the team's performance has been mostly uninspired, and personnel troubles have resulted in scandal and controversy.
Before he took over in 1998, the Knicks had made it to the playoffs in each of the previous 11 seasons. In the 25 years since, the team has reached the playoffs nine times, including three times in the past 11 seasons and has had 14 different coaches and nine presidents or general managers.
This spring, the Knicks completed their best season in a decade, making it to the second round of the N.B.A. playoffs.
The conflicts over Mr. Dolan's tenure go deeper than the team's win-loss record. In 2007, a federal jury ruled that Madison Square Garden and Isiah Thomas, then the team's coach, subjected Anucha Browne, a former Knicks executive, to a hostile work environment -- and that Mr. Dolan fired her when she complained. Mr. Dolan and Madison Square Garden paid her more than $ 10 million. "I, to this day, think that we were wronged" by the verdict, Mr. Dolan said.
Mr. Thomas, who declined to comment, is no longer working for the Knicks but sits on the board of directors of Sphere Entertainment Co. Ms. Browne declined to comment.
'You're Going to Bomb.'
Until he had the Sphere -- "his baby," as Mr. Lhota called it -- Mr. Dolan invested himself in hobbies.
He grew up on Long Island, where he learned to sail. As he was building his portfolio at Cablevision under his father, Mr. Dolan raced 70-foot, 12-man sailboats around the world, from Cape Town to Rio de Janeiro. Often his parents and a few of his six sons traveled to watch him race.
Though Mr. Dolan said he never drank while at sea, the culture of sailing deepened his growing dependence on booze. "The whole sailboat/yacht-racing culture was around alcohol," he said. "You go out on the boat and you come back and get trashed at the yacht club, with your pink pants and Izod shirt."
In the summer of 1993, Mr. Dolan checked into the Hazelden Betty Ford addiction treatment center. He has been sober since, he said.
About a decade later, he shifted his focus to music, forming a band, JD & The Straight Shot. Mr. Dolan calls the sound, which can evoke bluesy rock, "swampy."
Their songs include "Better Find a Church" (2015) and "I Should've Known" (2018) about Mr. Dolan's former friend Harvey Weinstein, the former Hollywood producer and convicted sex offender. In "The Great Divide" from 2019, JD & The Straight Shot address Mr. Dolan's distrust of the press ("In the morning/I get the news/So hard to know/Know what's true").
Mr. Dolan ran the show, but he was committed to creating a bond among the musicians, said Erin Slaver, the band's fiddler. In 2016, she became pregnant and was worried she would lose her job as a touring member of the band. But, she said, he paid her through her maternity leave and, when she was ready to rejoin the tour, he paid for her baby and nanny to travel with them on his private plane.
Mr. Dolan used his connections to hook them up with their best-known gig: opening for the Eagles, a band managed by Irving Azoff, a longtime business associate who is representing the Sphere in negotiations with artists. When Mr. Azoff broached the idea with the Eagles, he said, "certain members said, 'You're going to bomb."' As they predicted, JD & The Straight Shot mostly played for the ushers and security guards. "There weren't a lot of people in their seats," Mr. Azoff said.
But he said Mr. Dolan's experience of performing at big venues helped shape the Sphere. "He's bound and determined to create this experience for both musicians and audiences," he said.
The Airing of Grievances.
In mid-July, politicians, bureaucrats, lawyers, architects, engineers and ordinary citizens crowded into a City Hall hearing room -- many of them specifically to vent about Madison Square Garden, and by proxy, Mr. Dolan.
The stated purpose of the hearing was to discuss the proposed renewal of the Garden's "special permit," which allows it to host more than 2,500 people at a time. The company had requested that the permit be renewed in perpetuity.
But many New York political leaders have for years felt exasperated by Mr. Dolan, whom they perceive as profiting from his control of important institutions at the city's expense. (Representatives of the Garden pointed to the company's charitable efforts and to the more than $ 2 billion they said the arena contributes to the city economy.)
"It's important that we keep Madison Square Garden on a short leash," State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal testified.
He and others railed against a state law exempting Madison Square Garden from paying property taxes and the company's use of facial recognition technology. They discussed the possible renovation of Penn Station -- and what support the Garden should provide.
Mr. Dolan was not present and was rarely mentioned by name.
But later in the summer, after two City Council committees voted to extend Madison Square Garden's permit by only five years, he reflected on the role that he might have played.
As a general measure, he said, New York creates impediments for business owners, but "I might exacerbate it a little bit by being Jim Dolan," he said.
"Things like the lawyer ban policy poked a stick in people's eyes," he said. He is not sorry. "We're going to continue to be ourselves and do what we think is right."
That would include not contributing to the cost of a future Penn Station project. "That's a civic responsibility," he said. "We're a private enterprise. But we will certainly cooperate with it."
He does not expect progress anytime soon. For more than 20 years, there has been talk about improving Penn Station, he said. "The best I give it, personally, is 50-50 that anything will happen," he said.
The rancor directed toward him as well as what he sees as the city's sluggish pace are among the reason he decided to build the Sphere in Las Vegas. Had he tried to build it in New York, "My kids would be lucky if they saw it" completed, he said.
But Is He Lucky?
Less than a month before opening night, Mr. Dolan sat in his office, sipping matcha tea from an I❤️NY mug. "Across the entire organization, the anxiety level is geometrically increasing," he said. At the top of that pyramid? "That's me."
That day's headache involved the Sphere's Wi-Fi system; it was glitching and would require the installation of boosters.
But there was plenty going right too. The next two musical acts to perform in residency at the Sphere had been booked. "Big names," Mr. Dolan said but would not specify.
As the new business ramps up, he will be traveling west a few times a month for the foreseeable future.
Vegas is not his favorite city, but it has its charms. "Black jack," he said.
"Am I good? That's not the right question," he said.
Is he lucky?
Mr. Dolan leaned back in his chair at his conference table in his office high above the most famous arena in the world, and took a hit off his nicotine vape.
"That," he said, "is the right question."

A Collaboration to Make Renewable-Energy Projects Work for Workers: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Labor leaders worry that some federal incentives for renewable energy do not come with strict standards on pay. In Maine, they added their own.
President Biden's labor and environmental goals are colliding in the auto industry, where concerns over the electric vehicle transition underpin an autoworkers strike. But in states like Maine, unions and environmental groups have teamed up in an attempt to make a central promise of the president's green agenda come true for workers.
Mr. Biden has a favorite phrase when talking about the expansive climate bill he signed into law last year: "When I think climate -- not a joke -- I think jobs," he said last month at the White House. "When I say climate means jobs, I mean good-paying union jobs."
That has not yet been the case for Mr. Biden's agenda. The White House estimates that three bills Mr. Biden signed into law -- the infrastructure bill, the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act -- have spurred more than $ 500 billion in planned investments in low-emission energy and advanced manufacturing that will eventually lead to thousands of new jobs. But much of that has flowed to conservative states like Tennessee and South Carolina -- which have relatively low levels of union membership -- partly because labor is less expensive there than in heavily unionized states like Michigan.
Policymakers in Maine are trying to change that trend with a new law that seeks to make the state a more attractive destination for clean-energy investment -- and to ensure those investments create new union jobs. Their efforts center on the development and deployment of offshore wind power, a sector that, like electric vehicles, is crucial to Mr. Biden's economic and emissions goals.
Gov. Janet Mills of Maine, a Democrat, recently signed a law that seeks to jump-start an offshore wind industry that has been in the works for more than a decade, while trying to boost unionization of the sector. The law attaches its procurement spending to new labor standards for what officials hope will be thousands of new wind-energy workers, including wage minimums and requirements meant to boost the odds that jobs will go to union members.
Some of the spending that Mr. Biden has approved carries similar requirements aimed at helping unions and boosting wages. But much of it does not, including vast tax credits for clean energy created by the Inflation Reduction Act.
Union leaders are hoping Maine's law -- and those like it in other liberal states -- help fulfill Mr. Biden's "union jobs" promise for his climate spending.
"Maine paints a picture of what can be done anywhere," said Matt Schlobohm, the executive director of the Maine A.F.L.-C.I.O. labor union.
Maine has received federal funding from several of Mr. Biden's economic laws, but no new private investments in electric vehicles or other low-emission energy manufacturing projects, according to Biden administration statistics. To help attract that money, Ms. Mills pushed bills earlier this year to speed the manufacturing of offshore turbines at a so-called wind port and guarantee the purchase of the electricity that those turbines will eventually generate.
A coalition of union leaders and environmental groups pushed the governor to go further and include wage floors, training standards and other measures meant to help workers and unions in offshore wind projects.
The group's leaders included Jason J. Shedlock, the president of the Maine State Building and Construction Trades Council. At one point, he told the governor's staff that if she did not agree to labor-friendly provisions in the bill, he would lead a coordinated union effort urging the Biden administration to deny the state new funding for infrastructure, clean energy and other projects.
Ms. Mills vetoed an early version of the wind bill over its labor provisions -- specifically, a requirement that construction and manufacturing projects in the state be governed by a form of collective bargaining known as project labor agreements.
But Mr. Shedlock and his allies, including top environmental groups across the state, rewrote the bill and cut a deal with Ms. Mills in the dying days of the state's legislative session.
"We knew that Maine had an opportunity to be a national leader in this industry," Mr. Shedlock said recently. "We also knew that if we didn't insist on strong labor standards, that industry would be sold to the lowest bidder."
White House officials insist that Mr. Biden's agenda will lead to the significant creation of union manufacturing jobs, citing examples like a Ford Motor announcement that it will add 6,200 union jobs across the Midwest as part of its electric vehicle strategy.
Alex Jacquez, Mr. Biden's special assistant for economic development and industrial strategy, said in an interview that the administration was committed to "ensuring that the federal funding that we put out is incentivizing applicants and recipients who prioritize those strong labor standards and prioritize good-paying union jobs."
But not all incentives come with those strings, particularly the Inflation Reduction Act. The nonprofit group Good Jobs First estimates that five newly announced battery plants that pay relatively low wages will collectively reap millions of dollars in subsidies from that law.
If those trends calcify, union leaders worry they will spend years or decades fighting to organize workers in a new industry -- which would be more difficult than creating a heavily unionized one from scratch.
"There's nothing about a clean energy job that makes it a good job," said Francis Eanes, executive director of the Maine Labor Climate Council. "We have to make that true upfront."
Unions and environmental groups have increasingly worked together in recent years to pass laws in states like Illinois, California and New York that pair renewable-energy goals with high-wage and other labor standards for the work.
The risk to states is that companies become spooked by strict labor laws and take their climate tax credits elsewhere -- or invest less in renewables than they otherwise would. There is also a risk that strong wage and labor standards could push up the price of renewable projects, including wind, which is already facing mounting cost pressures in the United States and globally.
For labor and environmental groups, the effort has been both unifying and challenging.
"We're not talking about things like whether an offshore wind port is necessary. We're talking about what are the labor standards that we're going to use when we build that port?" said Kathleen Meil, senior director of policy and partnerships at the nonprofit Maine Conservation Voters. "That is a trickier conversation."
Environmental and labor groups carried their conversation with Ms. Mills and her staff deep into July this summer. At one point, Mr. Shedlock delivered a proposal to the governor's team and refused to leave until it had shared the proposal with her and responded to him.
The deal they cut, signed in late July, paves the way for a wind port manufacturing facility to be built on the Maine coast. It commits the state to a goal of procuring 3 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2040.
Dan Burgess, who directs Ms. Mills's energy office, said the commitment "helps give that signal and that certainty to the market that we're moving forward with this."
The spending is attached to new wage minimums and other labor standards for the workers who build, assemble and install those turbines. There are training mandates for those workers and a requirement that if nonunion contractors win state construction bids, they have to fill any unexpected job openings with union labor.
Mr. Biden celebrated it on a trip to Maine shortly after it was passed.
"It is a big, big deal," he said. The bill, he added, "will create good-paying union jobs."

Sunak Softens Britain's Climate Change Targets as Election Approaches: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he would delay a ban on the sale of new gas- and diesel-only cars, among other measures, sparking division in his own party.
After years of claiming leadership in the international fight against climate change, Britain's government on Wednesday gambled on an abrupt change of course, weakening key environmental pledges and promising lower costs for Britons who will soon be asked to vote in a general election.
Brushing aside sharp criticism from business leaders, environmentalists and some of his own Conservative lawmakers, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he would stick to Britain's overall goals for achieving net zero by 2050 but would do so in what he described as a more "sensible" way.
"It cannot be right for Westminster to impose such significant costs on working people," said Mr. Sunak, referring to the seat of Britain's government. He added, "If we continue down this path we risk losing the consent of the British people."
Mr. Sunak said that he would delay by five years a ban on the sale of gas and diesel cars, lower targets for replacing gas boilers and would propose new no new measures to discourage passengers from taking airplanes or to encourage car pooling.
Analysts said the significant shift in policy was designed to set a dividing line between the government and the opposition Labour Party ahead of a general election that Mr. Sunak must call by January 2025. Labour, led by Keir Starmer, has maintained a double-digit lead in the polls for months, and Mr. Sunak's own ratings have fallen since he became prime minister last October.
The new thinking in Downing Street seems to have crystallized after the Conservatives won a surprise victory in July in a parliamentary election in northwest London when they campaigned against moves by the city's Labour mayor to expand an air-quality initiative that charges drivers of older, more polluting vehicles.
Tom Burke, the chairman of E3G, an environmental research group, said that Mr. Sunak was seeking to send a political signal that his party supports car owners and those in economically stressed parts of the country, many of whom switched from Labour to the Conservatives in the 2019 general election.
"The point of this is to put Starmer in a trap of having to choose between the left-behind voters who he needs to win back, and the young green urbanites who are his natural supporters," said Mr. Burke, who has advised three former Conservative environment secretaries.
He added, however, that Mr. Sunak's shift was a "strategic error" that had revealed "the split inside the Tory Party" over climate action.
The new policy risks alienating large sections of the electorate at a time of growing public awareness of global warming, after Europe experienced record heat and devastating wildfires and floods this summer. Polling shows there is a broad consensus within Britain on the need for climate action.
The timing was jarring internationally, coming as the United Nations General Assembly -- from which Mr. Sunak was notably absent -- discussed climate protection policy. Earlier this year, the body's secretary general, António Guterres, warned that the era of global warming had ended and "the era of global boiling has arrived."
The announcement also coincided with King Charles III's state visit to France, which is intended to underscore the areas in which the two countries are working together, including on climate policy, a particular interest of the British monarch.
Mr. Sunak defended his position by arguing that Britain was doing more than other nations. "When our share of global emissions is less than 1 percent how can it be right that British citizens are now being told to sacrifice even more than others?"
Several lawmakers on the right of his party, and Britain's influential right-wing newspapers, praised the new approach and noted that the new, delayed, target of 2035 for the ban on sale of new gas and diesel cars is the same as that of the European Union.
But prominent critics included former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said that "business must have certainty about our net zero commitments" and that "we cannot afford to falter now or in any way lose our ambition for this country."
Chris Skidmore, a Conservative lawmaker, told the BBC that the changes were "potentially the greatest mistake" of Mr. Sunak's tenure so far, adding that "delivering on net zero provides a benefit not a cost."
Perhaps worse for Mr. Sunak was an angry response from Ford U.K., whose chair, Lisa Brankin, issued a statement regarding the delayed ban on new gas- and diesel-only cars that said: "Our business needs three things from the U.K. government: ambition, commitment and consistency. A relaxation of 2030 would undermine all three."
Automakers have made significant investments in Britain to meet the 2030 deadline. In July, Tata, the Indian conglomerate that owns Jaguar Land Rover, said it would build a battery plant in western England, a four-billion-pound (roughly $ 5 billion) project subsidized with government funds. And earlier this month BMW announced a $ 750 million investment to build electric Minis in Britain. Its plans called for converting an Oxford assembly plant to produce electric vehicles exclusively by 2030.
Those investments were a result of government policies promoting the transition to electric vehicles, said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, an industry group, in a statement on Wednesday. He said government must provide a "clear, consistent message" to help car buyers make the switch to electric.
"Confusion and uncertainty will only hold them back," he said.
James Alexander, chief executive of the U.K. Sustainable Investment and Finance Association, warned that Britain risked falling further behind in a global race to secure investment for the green transition to net zero if the government hurts investors' confidence.
Just a couple of years ago, Britain was "very clearly a global leader on sustainability and driving the global agenda" but "the government has backed firmly away from this direction of travel," Mr. Alexander said. "And investors follow policymakers' signals." Mr. Burke noted that most of the policy changes -- including the deadline change for the ban on gas and diesel cars -- would do nothing to reduce daily costs for voters in the short term, could cost Mr. Sunak support among more centrist swing voters in the south and would cause division within his own party. "Parties that are split rarely get elected and this is a party that's completely split," he said.
But the policy shift seemed to give a foretaste of the combative general election campaign that the Conservative Party seems to be planning next year.
Talking to the BBC on Wednesday the home secretary, Suella Braverman, put the party's new position bluntly: "We are not going to save the planet by bankrupting the British people."

Unions Fight in the States to Make Biden’s Climate Agenda Work for Workers

AUGUSTA, Maine — President Joe Biden’s labor and environmental goals are colliding in the auto industry, where concerns over the electric vehicle transition underpin an autoworkers strike. But in states like Maine, unions and environmental groups have teamed up in an attempt to make a central promise of the president’s green agenda come true for workers.
Biden has a favorite phrase when talking about the expansive climate bill he signed into law last year: “When I think climate — not a joke — I think jobs,” he said last month at the White House. “When I say climate means jobs, I mean good-paying union jobs.”
That has not yet been the case for Biden’s agenda. The White House estimates that three bills Biden signed into law — the infrastructure bill, the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act — have spurred more than $500 billion in planned investments in low-emission energy and advanced manufacturing that will eventually lead to thousands of new jobs. But much of that has flowed to conservative states such as Tennessee and South Carolina — which have relatively low levels of union membership — partly because labor is less expensive there than in heavily unionized states like Michigan.
Policymakers in Maine are trying to change that trend with a new law that seeks to make the state a more attractive destination for clean-energy investment — and to ensure those investments create new union jobs. Their efforts center on the development and deployment of offshore wind power, a sector that, like EVs, is crucial to Biden’s economic and emissions goals.
Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, recently signed a law that seeks to jump-start an offshore wind industry that has been in the works for more than a decade, while trying to boost unionization of the sector.
The law attaches its procurement spending to new labor standards for what officials hope will be thousands of new wind-energy workers, including wage minimums and requirements meant to boost the odds that jobs will go to union members.
Some of the spending Biden has approved carries similar requirements aimed at helping unions and boosting wages. But much of it does not, including vast tax credits for clean energy created by the Inflation Reduction Act.
Union leaders are hoping Maine’s law — and those like it in other liberal states — help fulfill Biden’s “union jobs” promise for his climate spending.
“Maine paints a picture of what can be done anywhere,” said Matt Schlobohm, the executive director of the Maine AFL-CIO labor union.
Maine has received federal funding from several of Biden’s economic laws but no new private investments in EVs or other low-emission energy manufacturing projects, according to Biden administration statistics. To help attract that money, Mills pushed bills this year to speed the manufacturing of offshore turbines at a so-called wind port and guarantee the purchase of the electricity those turbines will eventually generate.
A coalition of union leaders and environmental groups pushed the governor to go further and include wage floors, training standards and other measures meant to help workers and unions in offshore wind projects.
The group’s leaders included Jason J. Shedlock, the president of the Maine State Building and Construction Trades Council. At one point, he told the governor’s staff that if she did not agree to labor-friendly provisions in the bill, he would lead a coordinated union effort urging the Biden administration to deny the state new funding for infrastructure, clean energy and other projects.
Mills vetoed an early version of the wind bill over its labor provisions — specifically, a requirement that construction and manufacturing projects in the state be governed by a form of collective bargaining known as project labor agreements.
But Shedlock and his allies, including top environmental groups across the state, rewrote the bill and cut a deal with Mills in the dying days of the state’s legislative session.
“We knew that Maine had an opportunity to be a national leader in this industry,” Shedlock said recently. “We also knew that if we didn’t insist on strong labor standards, that industry would be sold to the lowest bidder.”
White House officials insist that Biden’s agenda will lead to the significant creation of union manufacturing jobs, citing examples like a Ford announcement that it will add 6,200 union jobs across the Midwest as part of its EV strategy.
Alex Jacquez, Biden’s special assistant for economic development and industrial strategy, said in an interview that the administration was committed to “ensuring that the federal funding that we put out is incentivizing applicants and recipients who prioritize those strong labor standards and prioritize good-paying union jobs.”
But not all incentives come with those strings, particularly the Inflation Reduction Act. The nonprofit group Good Jobs First estimates that five newly announced battery plants that pay relatively low wages will collectively reap millions of dollars in subsidies from that law.
If those trends calcify, union leaders worry they will spend years or decades fighting to organize workers in a new industry — which would be more difficult than creating a heavily unionized one from scratch.
“There’s nothing about a clean energy job that makes it a good job,” said Francis Eanes, executive director of the Maine Labor Climate Council. “We have to make that true upfront.”
Unions and environmental groups have increasingly worked together in recent years to pass laws in states like Illinois, California and New York that pair renewable-energy goals with high-wage and other labor standards for the work.
The risk to states is that companies become spooked by strict labor laws and take their climate tax credits elsewhere — or invest less in renewables than they otherwise would. There is also a risk that strong wage and labor standards could push up the price of renewable projects, including wind, which is already facing mounting cost pressures in the United States and globally.
For labor and environmental groups, the effort has been both unifying and challenging.
“We’re not talking about things like whether an offshore wind port is necessary. We’re talking about what are the labor standards that we’re going to use when we build that port?” said Kathleen Meil, senior director of policy and partnerships at the nonprofit Maine Conservation Voters. “That is a trickier conversation.”
Environmental and labor groups carried their conversation with Mills and her staff deep into July this summer. At one point, Shedlock delivered a proposal to the governor’s team and refused to leave until it had shared the proposal with her and responded to him.
The deal they cut, signed in late July, paves the way for a wind port manufacturing facility to be built on the Maine coast. It commits the state to a goal of procuring 3 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2040.
Dan Burgess, who directs Mills’ energy office, said the commitment “helps give that signal and that certainty to the market that we’re moving forward with this.”
The spending is attached to new wage minimums and other labor standards for the workers who build, assemble and install wind turbines. There are training mandates for those workers, and a requirement that if nonunion contractors win state construction bids, they have to fill any unexpected job openings with union labor.
Biden celebrated it on a trip to Maine shortly after it was passed.
“It is a big, big deal,” he said. The bill, he added, “will create good-paying union jobs.”

Here Are Ways to Reduce Loneliness: [Letter]

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "How We Can Fix Our Loneliness Epidemic," by Nicholas Kristof (column, Sept. 7), and "Flexible Housing," by Michelle Cottle (Opinion, Sept. 10):
In recent weeks, Mr. Kristof and Ms. Cottle have written convincingly about the problems of loneliness and isolation and the need for more flexible housing options as our population ages. In neither piece was there any mention of the option of home sharing, which is a low-cost and immediate means of aiding the housing crisis for both young and old.
At Home Share Oregon, a nonprofit based in Portland, we connect homeowners who have spare rooms -- many of whom are mortgage-burdened, lonely and living on meager Social Security checks -- with renters struggling to find a home.
While our mission is to help alleviate the affordable housing crisis by utilizing a large untapped inventory and preventing homelessness before it starts for both owners and renters, our program also assists those who are lonely and isolated and who benefit from the social interaction that comes with home sharing.
There was a time when boardinghouses were part of the cultural norm and helped bring people together. Over time that became stigmatized. We are working to change the cultural norm by moving forward with a proven means of housing people while at the same time building financial resilience and combating the loneliness epidemic.

To the Editor:
Some more ideas for addressing loneliness that have been working on my block of suburbia: a free little library of children's books in front of my house; firing the gardener and doing my own gardening in front of my house; walking the dog and meeting all the other dog walkers; passing out Christmas cookies; trading plants.
I don't have a porch with a swinging bench, but I do sit with my coffee on a built-in planter and read the paper and greet people who walk by. All you have to do is try.
Jane Warden

To the Editor:
"How We Can Fix Our Loneliness Epidemic" is marred by the claim, "Meanwhile, time with screens substitutes for time with human beings." This view, which exemplifies the anti-internet bias pervading current discussions of loneliness, overlooks the fact that time spent on screens is often time with human beings.
The internet enables me to interact with a much more diverse range of people than I can meet in my local community and to ward off loneliness by forming deep friendships that are based on mutual interests and emotional compatibility rather than mere propinquity.

A Voice for Unions: President Biden
To the Editor:
Re "President Strongly Defends Striking Autoworkers" (front page, Sept. 16):
President Biden is right: Automakers "should go further to ensure record corporate profits mean record contracts for the U.A.W."
That's why the U.A.W. began a limited strike against General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. This is all about accountability, respect and the future of electric vehicles.
It's hardly a surprise that company executives don't understand the union. They're not alone. Most C.E.O.s today came of age after Ronald Reagan was elected. They've never known a world where unions were treated with respect and corporate accountability. In fact, President Reagan set the example when he fired the air traffic controllers and broke their union.
The dirty little secret, though, is that until President Biden, Democrats shared the blame for ignoring labor unions. After the shock of Mr. Reagan's election, Democrats, desperate for money and business support, created the Democratic Business Council, inviting C.E.O.s for exclusive sessions with members of Congress. When labor unions asked to join the council, they were told, "No."
Now, for the first time in decades, labor unions have a strong voice in Washington: President Joe Biden.

Ukraine's Fate, and the World's
To the Editor:
Re "I Saw Firsthand How Much Is at Stake in Ukraine," by Thomas L. Friedman, and "Can Samantha Power Change Ukraine's Future?," by Bret Stephens (columns, Sept. 17):
Mr. Friedman and Mr. Stephens outdid themselves with their heartfelt and insightful firsthand accounts of the importance of events in Ukraine. I read them both twice.
It's truly inspiring that Ukrainians have united so courageously in the face of imperialist aggression that the civilized world had assumed was a disgraceful relic of history. The United States and Europe must help them win that fight.
American politics may present its frustrations, but what is happening in Ukraine is something of an entirely different level of importance to the world.
There are so many reasons that a second Trump presidency would be disastrous for America. But tragically, a return to power for Donald Trump, with his affinity for Vladimir Putin, would delay the eventual inevitable triumph of individual freedom over state-imposed tyranny for years. The future of human history is in the balance.

A 'Misguided' Effort to Promote Diversity at Colleges
To the Editor:
Re "Diversity Statements by Faculty Complicate Hiring on Campus" (front page, Sept. 10):
In 1950, the California state university system required all employees to sign an anti-Communist loyalty oath, which resulted in the firing of professors unwilling to sign. More than 70 years later, the very same institutions require an acceptably worded D.E.I. statement as a condition to hiring.
While today's goals may be laudable, an ideological litmus test of any kind is both misguided and an unconstitutional infringement on free speech.
Daniel Wolf
Teaneck, N.J.
To the Editor:
This article prompts the hypothetical question whether a latter-day Albert Einstein would have a chance of employment at Berkeley or a number of other University of California campuses.
When asked about his commitment to diversity, that world-class physicist would likely give a response along the lines of these words he once said: "I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university."
That fails, on Berkeley's scoring rubric, to indicate sufficient alignment with the ideology the college expects all faculty to share. And that would be the end of the applicant's candidacy in almost every instance.
U.C.'s research universities have been home to many of America's greatest scientists and scholars. Now several of them privilege activism when recruiting new faculty and otherwise do not even bother to consider the research and teaching records of applicants.
Research universities are the engines of scientific and technological progress, but U.C. has instead embraced dysfunctional ideological conformity.

Star Witness Against Meadows: Maybe Himself: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mark Meadows, a former top Trump aide, took the witness stand in hopes of having his election interference case moved to federal court. So far, the strategy has not paid off.
One morning last month in an Atlanta federal courtroom, Mark Meadows, former President Donald J. Trump's final chief of staff, was in the hot seat. And he was the one who had put himself there.
Mr. Meadows's lawyer had made the surprise move of asking his client to testify in an effort to have the Georgia election interference case against him moved to federal court, a venue where his chances of acquittal, or even having the case thrown out, may be a bit better than in the state court where he has been charged.
At issue was whether his actions -- as described in the indictment of Mr. Trump, Mr. Meadows and 17 others in Fulton County, Ga., last month -- could be considered within the scope of his duties as White House chief of staff. Mr. Meadows made the case for that under questioning by his lawyer, but he hit a snag when a prosecutor asked whether he had "any role" in coordinating the bogus electors who were used in a last-ditch effort to keep Mr. Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election.
"No, I did not," he replied.
The prosecutor then introduced into the record a December 2020 email that Mr. Meadows wrote to a Trump campaign staff member. In it, Mr. Meadows wrote, "We just need to have someone coordinating the electors for the states."
The exchange, which prosecutors will almost certainly use against Mr. Meadows at trial, underscored the high-stakes gamble that he took by testifying. So far, the gamble has not paid off: In early September, U.S. District Judge Steve C. Jones declined to move his case to federal court.
Mr. Meadows has appealed. But his testimony may have given ammunition to Georgia prosecutors as they prepare to try him, Mr. Trump and the 17 other defendants. Legal experts say that Mr. Meadows may have damaged his credibility while weakening his claim to immunity from state prosecution as a federal official, given his struggles to articulate how the actions ascribed to him in the indictment were part of his official duties rather than in service of the Trump campaign.
"He did do a number of things which will make the prosecutors' job easier," said Caren Morrison, a former federal prosecutor and associate law professor at Georgia State University, of Mr. Meadows's testimony. "He's created some additional trouble for himself, I think, as well as for Trump."
With an affable demeanor, Mr. Meadows has been described as a less than assertive chief of staff by former White House aides, and as someone with a habit of telling people what they wanted to hear.
During the hearing in Atlanta, Mr. Meadows portrayed himself as a supremely busy man whose White House job often put him at the nexus of policy and politics. While acknowledging that he interacted with the Trump campaign for various reasons, such as working out scheduling issues, he emphasized that he operated independently of it.
But Anna Cross, the prosecutor who cross-examined him, stressed that Mr. Meadows had specifically offered financial assistance from the Trump campaign in order to help with ballot verification in Georgia, in a December 2020 email he sent to an official there. Why, she asked, had Mr. Meadows made such an offer "on behalf of the Trump campaign?"
Mr. Meadows said he was just trying to "speed things up," and he explained that it was virtually impossible to keep politics out of the White House chief of staff job. That may ultimately prove convincing to a jury. The role is unquestionably unique; former President Gerald Ford described the chief of staff as a "filter" and "alter ego" for a president, whose own job involves mixing the duties of governing and campaigning.
Mr. Meadows's lawyer, George J. Terwilliger III, declined to comment. In court filings, the Meadows legal team argues that he did nothing illegal but was rather fulfilling his duties as the president's right-hand man.
Putting Mr. Meadows on the stand at this stage may even have offered certain advantages for his lawyers. "You get a little bit of a review of where the state's going to go, and his lawyer gets a preview of how he's going to do on the stand," said Noah H. Pines, an Atlanta-area criminal defense lawyer and former prosecutor.
At the same time, Mr. Pines said, every word of Mr. Meadows's testimony may now be used against him at trial.
Mr. Meadows said he went to Cobb County, Ga., in December 2020 to observe an audit of signatures on ballots -- one of the acts laid out in the indictment -- because he was in the Atlanta area visiting his children for Christmas. He anticipated Mr. Trump having questions about the procedure, he said, and so he visited in the spirit of "checking off a box to say this has been checked, that's a question that's been asked and answered."
Mr. Meadows also tried to explain his role in the now-famous Jan. 2, 2021, phone call from Mr. Trump to Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's secretary of state. During that call, Mr. Trump told Mr. Raffensperger he needed to "find" 11,780 votes, one more than what he needed to win in Georgia.
Mr. Meadows, who set up the call, also spoke on it, saying he hoped the president's team could "get the access to the secretary of state's data" to investigate claims of voter fraud that Mr. Trump was pushing.
The phone call to Mr. Raffensperger, he said at the recent hearing, was part of his effort to move closer to a "peaceful transfer of power" by taking some of Mr. Trump's lingering concerns about voter fraud in Georgia "off of the president's concern list."
"It seemed like his claim was, 'My job was to do anything and everything required by the president,"' said Melissa D. Redmon, a law professor at the University of Georgia who has been an Atlanta prosecutor. "The problem is that plays into the state's theory that some of the things that you did on behalf of the president were prohibited by your office, as an employee of the White House."
.
Four other defendants who were indicted along with Mr. Meadows and Mr. Trump are also trying to have their cases moved to federal courts. Among them is Jeffrey Clark, a former high-ranking Justice Department official, whose request was presented at a hearing on Monday. He declined to take the stand at the hearing, and attempted to introduce a written personal declaration instead.
Mr. Clark, who is charged with racketeering and one count of criminal attempt to commit false statements and writings, drafted a letter to Georgia officials in December 2020 falsely claiming that the Justice Department had "identified significant concerns" about "the outcome of the election" in Georgia and several other states.
His statement described that letter, which was never sent, as "a candid discussion of options and pros and cons with the president" that was part of a "privileged legal conversation." It also said that Mr. Clark had never taken "knowingly false positions" while at the department.
But Judge Jones refused to admit the statement into the record, giving prosecutors an opening to argue, among other things, that Mr. Clark's legal team had provided insufficient evidence as to why his case should be moved.

One morning last month in an Atlanta federal courtroom, Mark Meadows, former President Donald Trump’s final chief of staff, was in the hot seat. And he was the one who had put himself there.
Meadows’ lawyer had made the surprise move of asking his client to testify in an effort to have the Georgia election interference case against him moved to federal court, a venue where his chances of acquittal, or even having the case thrown out, may be a bit better than in the state court where he has been charged.
At issue was whether his actions — as described in the indictment of Trump, Meadows and 17 others in Fulton County, Georgia, last month — could be considered within the scope of his duties as White House chief of staff. Meadows made the case for that under questioning by his lawyer, but he hit a snag when a prosecutor asked whether he had “any role” in coordinating the bogus electors who were used in a last-ditch effort to keep Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election.
“No, I did not,” he replied.
The prosecutor then introduced into the record a December 2020 email that Meadows wrote to a Trump campaign staff member. In it, Meadows wrote, “We just need to have someone coordinating the electors for the states.”
The exchange, which prosecutors will almost certainly use against Meadows at trial, underscored the high-stakes gamble that he took by testifying. So far, the gamble has not paid off: In early September, U.S. District Judge Steve C. Jones declined to move his case to federal court.
Meadows has appealed. But his testimony may have given ammunition to Georgia prosecutors as they prepare to try him, Trump and the 17 other defendants. Legal experts say Meadows may have damaged his credibility while weakening his claim to immunity from state prosecution as a federal official, given his struggles to articulate how the actions ascribed to him in the indictment were part of his official duties rather than in service of the Trump campaign.
“He did do a number of things which will make the prosecutors’ job easier,” said Caren Morrison, a former federal prosecutor and associate law professor at Georgia State University, of Meadows’ testimony. “He’s created some additional trouble for himself, I think, as well as for Trump.”
With an affable demeanor, Meadows has been described as a less than assertive chief of staff by former White House aides, and as someone with a habit of telling people what they wanted to hear.
During the hearing in Atlanta, Meadows portrayed himself as a supremely busy man whose White House job often put him at the nexus of policy and politics. While acknowledging that he interacted with the Trump campaign for various reasons, such as working out scheduling issues, he emphasized that he operated independently of it.
But Anna Cross, the prosecutor who cross-examined him, stressed that Meadows had specifically offered financial assistance from the Trump campaign to help with ballot verification in Georgia, in a December 2020 email he sent to an official there. Why, she asked, had Meadows made such an offer “on behalf of the Trump campaign?”
Meadows said he was just trying to “speed things up,” and he explained that it was virtually impossible to keep politics out of the White House chief of staff job. That may ultimately prove convincing to a jury. The role is unquestionably unique. Former President Gerald Ford described the chief of staff as a “filter” and “alter ego” for a president, whose own job involves mixing the duties of governing and campaigning.
Meadows’ lawyer, George J. Terwilliger III, declined to comment. In court filings, the Meadows legal team argues that he did nothing illegal but was rather fulfilling his duties as the president’s right-hand man.
Putting Meadows on the stand at this stage may even have offered certain advantages for his lawyers. “You get a little bit of a review of where the state’s going to go, and his lawyer gets a preview of how he’s going to do on the stand,” said Noah H. Pines, an Atlanta-area criminal defense lawyer and former prosecutor.
At the same time, Pines said, every word of Meadows’ testimony may now be used against him at trial.
Meadows said he went to Cobb County, Georgia, in December 2020 to observe an audit of signatures on ballots — one of the acts laid out in the indictment — because he was in the Atlanta area visiting his children for Christmas. He anticipated Trump having questions about the procedure, he said, and so he visited in the spirit of “checking off a box to say this has been checked, that’s a question that’s been asked and answered.”
Meadows also tried to explain his role in the now-famous Jan. 2, 2021, phone call from Trump to Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state. During that call, Trump told Raffensperger he needed to “find” 11,780 votes, one more than what he needed to win in Georgia.
Meadows, who set up the call, also spoke on it, saying he hoped the president’s team could “get the access to the secretary of state’s data” to investigate claims of voter fraud that Trump was pushing.
The phone call to Raffensperger, he said at the recent hearing, was part of his effort to move closer to a “peaceful transfer of power” by taking some of Trump’s lingering concerns about voter fraud in Georgia “off of the president’s concern list.”
“It seemed like his claim was, ‘My job was to do anything and everything required by the president,’” said Melissa D. Redmon, a law professor at the University of Georgia who has been an Atlanta prosecutor. “The problem is that plays into the state’s theory that some of the things that you did on behalf of the president were prohibited by your office, as an employee of the White House.”
Four other defendants who were indicted along with Meadows and Trump are also trying to have their cases moved to federal courts. Among them is Jeffrey Clark, a former high-ranking Justice Department official, whose request was presented at a hearing Monday. He declined to take the stand at the hearing and attempted to introduce a written personal declaration instead.
Clark, who is charged with racketeering and one count of criminal attempt to commit false statements and writings, drafted a letter to Georgia officials in December 2020 falsely claiming that the Justice Department had “identified significant concerns” about “the outcome of the election” in Georgia and several other states.
His statement described that letter, which was never sent, as “a candid discussion of options and pros and cons with the president” that was part of a “privileged legal conversation.” It also said that Clark had never taken “knowingly false positions” while at the department.
But Jones refused to admit the statement into the record, giving prosecutors an opening to argue, among other things, that Clark’s legal team had provided insufficient evidence as to why his case should be moved.

Morrison also said that it could prove damaging for Trump’s case that Meadows acknowledged in testimony that Trump had a “personal interest” in seeking a reversal of the election results in Georgia.
“That’s partially making the argument that the prosecution wants to make, that Trump being all up in Georgia’s business about the election was not part of his executive duties as president,” she said.
The Meadows legal team will have another chance to make its case for moving the case to federal court, this time to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. While he waits, four other defendants seeking to move their cases to federal court will get hearings this week, starting with Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official, on Monday.
It remains unclear whether any of them will take the stand.

Full text: I thought being sexually bold was a game I was allowed to play. I had no idea of the punishment that awaited me -- or the surprising healing to come.
I have been pinned under the body of a man more than once.
The second time I was 23, in a hostel bed in Poland, where I had stoked a man's rage by declining to join him for a drink. In the middle of the night, he sought me out in the hostel's mixed dorm room, put himself over me and hissed, "I waited for you."
I was prepared to gouge his eyes out with my keys if it came to that. Call it the loss of innocence. It's the reason I took up Krav Maga, then Muay Thai, why I relish self-defense and martial arts classes. I recount this story proudly: "A man pinned me to my bed. He might have raped me. I took up martial arts."
The first time I was 19, with a fractured hip from rollerblading. The summer of my unchosen initiation into sexual knowing. He was four years older than I; we had met over Thanksgiving break.
I knew he was taken with me -- my sharp tongue and brazen sass, the kind of fire that is a challenge to certain men who view it as a threat to be doused. There are men who cannot stand to see a carefree woman -- who are both enthralled and enraged by her. But I did not know this then. I was so young, virginal but precocious, the kind of sexually inexperienced woman who constantly cracked dirty jokes and talked about sex. I thought it was a game I was allowed to play. I did not know the punishment that awaited me.
He would visit me in the hospital after hours, his hands finding their way under my hospital gown. I stiffened in fear and nausea, even though this way of being touched was nonetheless intriguing in its novelty, making my body lurch in ways he probably took for desire. He took many things from me that summer, so many firsts.
I was flattered and frazzled by his oppressive attention and too inexperienced to recognize it for the manipulation that it was. I was young and curious, and he was insistent, so I continued to see him.
Another time, at his place, I remember staring at my crutches -- forlorn witnesses -- propped in the corner of the room when he pinned me to his bed, how I whispered for him to stop, shifting to protect my hip. In the end, he didn't rape me. I had been no fun, a killjoy. He smiled at my parents when they picked me up.
My hip healed, but this brush with sexual aggression sent me into a tailspin that I could not acknowledge as such for years. I became alien to myself, unwilling and unable to touch myself. A recuperative experience with "The Vagina Monologues" and FemSex classes as a college student set me on the path to healing. But I was anxious I wasn't healing fast enough (which is exactly the wrong way to think about healing).
I sought out sexual experiences, trying to regain some control. At a bondage club, I let myself be tied up and whipped. I was enticed by the radical trust and consent these spaces promised. Some of it was liberating, but in hindsight, I was also recklessly deluded.
When, in a dark corner of a club, with no warning, a stranger quickly wrenched my shoulder out of its socket and reset it (or so he claimed), I was finally slowed by not shock but sadness. How casually, how calmly violence comes to the most unremarkable of men.
Over the years, I would fall to pieces at different moments: When Donald Trump became president even after he bragged about grabbing women whenever he wanted; when Dr. Christine Blasey Ford gave her testimony; when Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed.
Each time, I wept and raged as my partner of 10 years held me, his embrace allowing the storm of my emotions. I felt so apologetic that he had to deal with me, this broken person whom someone else had broken. He would love my hurt away, he promised, in that naïve, desperate way that we promise the impossible to those we love.
In martial arts, I found some vindication and control. I was turning myself into my own protector, my own weapon. And it served another function that was gratifying: It allowed me to nurse the fantasy of retaliation. Now I was the arbiter of justice should evil follow me home. Though I never hope for this to be a reality, the fantasy wards away the haunting spirits of trauma.
My husband and I had been friends for years before we became romantically involved. He knew everything about my past, every fling, every ghost. After three years of long-distance dating, he left his finance job in Singapore to be with me in Rhode Island and to pursue his passion, competitive cycling, until a terrible accident ended his cycling career. When we moved to Hong Kong during the pandemic for my current job, he found a new passion: Brazilian jiu-jitsu. As for me, I started Muay Thai training again.
During a year of punishing Covid restrictions in Hong Kong, our physical training commitments kept us sane, though we practiced them separately. This year, we decided to take a vacation, booking ourselves into a retreat that offered both Muay Thai and Brazilian jiu-jitsu classes. He thought it would be fun for us to dabble in the other's sport. He wanted to teach me what he had grown to love.
When he easily put me in a lock during our first class, I had a stupid revelation. In all our years together, I had failed to comprehend him as he was -- extremely fit and strong. I knew this at some level, of course. A lifelong endurance athlete, he had been a Singapore national cyclist, competing at the World Cycling Championships, and his jiu-jitsu friends frequently comment on his stamina and toughness.
None of this registered because I had never encountered his body that way. Here was the sweet man who shares my bed and adjusts my glasses when they slip down my nose, whose physical prowess I best observed in his dexterous use of chopsticks, lifting the delicate cheek off steamed fish -- that prized part, which he always saved for me.
In Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the first objective is usually to "pass the guard," getting past your opponent's knees to establish a more dominant position, often mounting them. The instant I felt the weight of him on me, felt my body pushed against my will, I was returned to those awful moments of helplessness, felt the involuntary acid taste of fear pool in my cheeks.
It had never occurred to me that my husband could be capable of violence in the same way that we forget that animals, however cute or domesticated, are animals. When he swept my body under, pinned me down, I felt the fright I knew all too well and did not care to know again.
Then that memory crackled, like a glitch in the matrix, a program being overwritten by another.
On me was a body, scarily strong, but one I knew intimately, belonging to a man who loves me. His body, capable of such force, had only ever done nice things to mine. My body, thrumming with stress and adrenaline, began to hum instead with desire. Here was my place of refuge and solace. Here, this nook, where I place my head like a question, and he answers with the steady constant of his heartbeat. His overpowering jiu-jitsu lock was something I had only ever experienced as an embrace.
Here was the man who told me he would love away my fear. Wedged under him, as the old dread rose and then subsided in my chest, I realized he had really done it. Like an oyster, he had taken the painful grit of my past into the sanctuary of his embrace and smoothed it over into a pearl he was presenting to me.
Anyone who has shivered in the cold shadow of assault knows that the enduring paranoia lies in the knowledge of how easily violence can erupt, how passion describes love but also anger, how those closest to us can harm us. Yet by reverse engineering this encounter of violence in our jiu-jitsu session, we had transformed that suspicious border into the site of my healing.
I always wrote off my husband's promises to protect me in my moments of despair because I assumed he meant he was prepared to do so physically, an engagement with masculinity that I dislike. But I had not understood his meaning.
His promise of protection never entailed revenge or violence, only his conviction that loving someone unwaveringly could be transformative. Only that impossible promise, to be with me through my worst days and memories -- not to erase the dark spot of my past, but to go there with me and bring it into the light.

President Strongly Defends Striking Autoworkers: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: White House aides believe the battle between the car companies and their workers underscores many of the president's policy positions.
President Biden forcefully sided with the striking United Auto Workers on Friday, dispatching two of his top aides to Detroit and calling for the three biggest American car companies to share their profits with employees whose wages and benefits he said have been unfairly eroded for years.
In brief remarks from the White House hours after the union began what they called a targeted strike, Mr. Biden acknowledged that the automakers had made "significant offers" during contract negotiations, but he left no doubt his intention to make good on a 2020 promise to always have the backs of unions.
"Over generations, autoworkers sacrificed so much to keep the industry alive and strong, especially the economic crisis and the pandemic," Mr. Biden said. "Workers deserve a fair share of the benefits they helped create."
Mr. Biden said that Julie Su, the acting secretary of labor, and Gene Sperling, a top White House economic adviser, would go to Michigan immediately to support both sides in the negotiations. But he said the automakers "should go further to ensure record corporate profits mean record contracts for the U.A.W."
For decades, Mr. Biden has been an unapologetic backer of unions who rejects even the approach of some Democrats when it comes to balancing the interests of corporate America and the labor movement.
During the past several years, he has helped nurture what polls suggest is a resurgence of support for unions, as younger Americans in new-economy jobs push for the right to organize at the workplace. Mr. Biden declares that "unions built the middle class" in virtually every speech he delivers.
"That was most pro-union statement from a White House in decades, if not longer," Eddie Vale, a veteran Democratic strategist who worked for years at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said after the president's remarks.
The president's decision to weigh in on the side of the union without much reservation will most likely to draw fierce criticism from different quarters. Earlier in the day -- even before the president's White House comments -- Suzanne P. Clark, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, issued a searing statement blaming the strike on Mr. Biden for "promoting unionization at all costs."
After Mr. Biden's remarks, Neil Bradley, the group's top lobbyist in Washington, said the president's message and the pro-union policies his administration has pursued have "emboldened these demands that just aren't grounded in reality."
And in a possible preview of a rematch with former President Donald J. Trump, NBC on Friday aired part of an interview in which Mr. Trump sided just as forcefully with the car companies against the unions.
"The autoworkers will not have any jobs, Kristen, because all of these cars are going to be made in China," Mr. Trump said in an interview set to air Sunday on the network's "Meet the Press" program. "The autoworkers are being sold down the river by their leadership, and their leadership should endorse Trump."
Friday's walkout by the U.A.W. is in some ways a broader test of Mr. Biden's economic agenda beyond just his pro-union stand. It also touches on his call for higher wages for the middle class; his climate-driven push to reimagine an electric vehicle future for car companies; and his call for higher taxes for the wealthy. The strike is centered in Michigan, a state that the president practically must win in 2024 to remain in the Oval Office.
"You've got rebuilding the middle class and building things again here," Mr. Vale said. "You've got green energy, technology and jobs. You've got important states for the election. So all of these are sort of together here in a swirl."
At the White House, Mr. Biden's aides believe the battle between the car companies and its workers will underscore many of the president's arguments about the need to reduce income inequality, the benefits of empowered employees, and the surge in profits for companies like the automakers that makes them able to afford paying higher wages.
That approach is at the heart of the economic argument that Mr. Biden and his campaign team are preparing to make in the year ahead. But it sometimes comes into conflict with the president's other priorities, including a shift toward electric vehicles.
Mr. Biden's push for automobiles powered by batteries instead of combustion engines is seen by many unions as a threat to the workers who have toiled for decades to build cars that run on gas. The unions want factories that make electric cars -- most of which are not unionized -- to see higher wages and benefits too.
So far, Mr. Biden has sidestepped the question of whether his push for a green auto industry will hasten the demise of the unions. But Friday's remarks are an indication that he remains as committed as ever to the political organizations that have been at the center of his governing coalition for years.
In his remarks on Friday, he hinted at the tension inherent in the technological transition from one mode of propulsion to another.
"I believe that transition should be fair, and a win-win for autoworkers and auto companies," he said. But he added: "I also believe the contract agreement must lead to a vibrant 'Made in America' future that promotes good, strong middle class jobs that workers can raise a family on, where the U.A.W. remains at the heart of our economy, and where the Big Three companies continue to lead in innovation, excellence, quality and leadership."
The targeted strike is designed to disrupt one of America's oldest industries at a time that Mr. Biden is sharpening the contrast between what rivals and allies call "Bidenomics" and a Republican plan that the president warns is a darker version of trickle-down economics that mostly benefits the rich.
"Their plan -- MAGAnomics -- is more extreme than anything America has ever seen before," Mr. Biden said on Thursday, hours before the union voted to strike.
Mr. Biden was joined on Friday by several of the more liberal members of his party, who assailed the automakers and stood by the striking workers.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, sent out a fund-raising appeal accusing the companies of refusing "to meet the demands of workers negotiating for better pay" despite having "netted nearly a quarter trillion dollars in profit over the last decade."
Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, visited striking Jeep workers at a Toledo plant that makes the popular Wrangler sport-utility vehicle and declared that "Ohioans stand in solidarity with autoworkers around our state as they demand the Big Three automakers respect the work they do to make these companies successful."
How Mr. Biden navigates the strike and its consequences could have a significant impact on his hopes for re-election. In a CNN poll earlier this month, just 39 percent of people approved of the job he is doing as president and 58 percent said his policies have made economic conditions in the United States worse, not better.
The fact that the strike is centered in Michigan is also critical. Mr. Biden won the state over Mr. Trump in 2020 with just over 50 percent of the vote. The state's 16 electoral votes were crucial to his victory over Mr. Trump.
Unlike previous strikes involving rail workers or air traffic controllers, Mr. Biden has no special legal authority to intervene. Still, he is not exactly just an observer either.
Just before the strike vote, Mr. Biden called Shawn Fain, the president of the U.A.W., as well as top executives of the car companies. Aides said that the president told the parties to ensure that workers get a fair contract and he urged both sides to stay at the negotiating table.
Economists say a lengthy strike, if it goes on for weeks or even months, could be a blow to the American economy, especially in the middle of the country.
Still, the president is unwavering on policies toward both unions and the environment. In a Labor Day speech in Philadelphia, Mr. Biden renewed both his vision about what he called a "transition to an electric vehicle future made in America" -- which he said would protect jobs -- and his rock-solid belief in unions.
"You know, there are a lot of politicians in this country who don't know how to say the word 'union,"' he said. "They talk about labor, but they don't say 'union.' It's 'union.' I'm one of the -- I'm proud to say 'union.' I'm proud to be the most pro-union president."

Full text: Balanchine didn't think his ballets would last. But many have become classics, the cornerstone of repertory not just at City Ballet but around the world.
While celebrating its 75th anniversary this fall, New York City Ballet is performing 18 ballets by its founding choreographer, George Balanchine. But to get a sense of the global standing of Balanchine, 40 years after his death, other numbers might be more telling. Last year, for instance, around 50 other ballet companies across the world performed his works, about 75 dances in total.
Balanchine likened his ballets to butterflies: "They live for a season." But they have lasted much longer than that. They have become classics, cornerstones of the international repertory, 20th-century equivalents of 19th-century staples like "Swan Lake," danced everywhere by all the major ballet companies and most of the minor ones, too.
These ballets, like Balanchine, emerged from the same Russian Imperial tradition as "Swan Lake," but were shaped -- as he was -- by America, and by modernism and other 20th-century searches for the new. Always intimately connected to music, they sometimes told stories and sometimes, like music, were more abstract arrangements of forms and energies. They stretched ballet -- in technique, in how daring and dynamic it could be, in how little outside of itself it needed -- and were unparalleled in range and influence, so much so that the state of ballet is often framed as a question: Where is the next Balanchine?
City Ballet still performs by far the most Balanchine -- the most ballets, the most often -- but performances by other companies probably reach as many or more people, certainly in more places. All these performances, though, are connected to New York City Ballet, because the dissemination of his works remains a matter of lineage -- of connections to Balanchine.
Before City Ballet became a durable laboratory and library for Balanchine's choreography, he often worked as a choreographer for hire. That's why American Ballet Theater dances "Theme and Variations," which he made for that troupe in 1947. But few of the companies he created works for have survived, and most of the works that survived are those that became part of the City Ballet repertory. The company was the hub from which his influence radiated.
In the early years of the company, Balanchine sometimes staged works for European troupes with which he was connected: Paris Opera Ballet, the Royal Danish Ballet, what became the Royal Ballet. The reception to his innovations, especially the more radical ones, was highly variable, both abroad and in the more ballet-bereft country he had made his home. There, Balanchine was both generous and prudent with his ballets.
"He was giving them away for free, but he was in control," said Jennifer Homans, the author of "Mr. B: George Balanchine's 20th Century." "Looking at the correspondence, you can see he was careful about who could do it and who couldn't, and about which ballets could be done by others and which couldn't."
He staged them himself, or he sent people he trusted. Francia Russell danced with City Ballet from 1956 to 1961. Since 1964, when she became a ballet master at the company, she has staged more than 200 productions of Balanchine ballets for other troupes. "They weren't many people doing it at the beginning," she said. "At first, I staged only ballets that I had actually danced." Later, it became possible to consult films, but Russell didn't use them much. "I always said I'm staging them the way I danced them when with Mr. B was with us."
It was during the 1960s that City Ballet became a dominant institution, with a custom-built theater in the new Lincoln Center. An exceptionally large grant from the Ford Foundation put City Ballet and its affiliated School of American Ballet at the helm of a program to support ballet and ballet education. Following Balanchine's recommendations, the foundation granted seed funding to regional troupes like Boston Ballet and Pennsylvania (now Philadelphia) Ballet. Balanchine granted these fledgling companies something nearly as important: some of his works, free of charge.
That process continued as members of City Ballet founded their own companies or became artistic directors. Arthur Mitchell, the company's first Black principal dancer, erected the repertory of Dance Theater of Harlem, founded in 1969, on a foundation of Balanchine pieces. Some City Ballet dancers found leadership roles in Europe, like Patricia Neary in Switzerland. In 1977, Russell and her husband, Kent Stowell, moved from Frankfurt Ballet to Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle and built it into another outpost of Balanchine repertory.
"Mr. B said he trusted me to only ask for the ballets I thought our dancers could do," Russell said. "And whatever we wanted, it was 'Of course, dear.' He never asked for a penny." These ballets, she added, "were an education in classical dance for our dancers," a sentiment commonly voiced by artistic directors.
After Balanchine's death, in 1983, the City Ballet diaspora spread further. In 1985, Edward Villella, a City Ballet star of the 1960s and '70s, transformed Miami City Ballet into a Balanchinian troupe. That same year, Helgi Tomasson, after dancing with City Ballet for 15 years, became artistic director of San Francisco Ballet, a post he held until 2022. None of these and other companies led by City Ballet alumni danced Balanchine exclusively, but there was a family connection. Successors were often in the family, too. Russell and Stowell were followed (in 2005) by Peter Boal, Villella (in 2012) by Lourdes Lopez, both former principals at City Ballet and alumni of its school.
By this point, acquiring a Balanchine work was no longer "Of course, dear." Skeptical that his works could last without him, and never much interested in posterity, he left his ballets in his will not to City Ballet but to 14 dancers and colleagues. The George Balanchine Trust was formed in 1987 to bring some order and stability to the licensing and restaging. The stagers it authorized were all dancers who had been with Balanchine in the classroom and rehearsal studio.
Now Balanchine works circulated to places where they had not before been part of the repertory. Russell was the first to stage one in China, in 1987. The next year, she brought one to the Soviet Union -- to the institution then known as the Kirov Ballet (now the Mariinsky), where Balanchine had trained in the first decades of the 20th century but where few of the dancers had seen his works or knew much about him.
Always, there have been questions about authenticity. Balanchine frequently changed his choreography -- for different dancers and stages -- so which was the right version and in whose memory of it? And beyond the steps, was the spirit transferable, the elusive and usually unspoken ideas, the all-important musicality? Disagreements about these questions -- applied to companies of dancers not trained in Balanchine's aesthetic and modifications to technique, but also to City Ballet -- were perpetual and often heated. For many viewers, Balanchine after Balanchine wasn't Balanchine at all, and couldn't be. Balanchine had suggested as much himself.
And now a new phase is coming. As Russell put it, speaking of her generation, "We're all too old to preserve that tradition in the same way."
Lopez, who is 20 years younger, made a similar point. "There aren't many of us," she said, "who worked with him and still talk about him as if he were next door." But she also spoke about dancers, at Miami City Ballet and elsewhere, hungry to learn Balanchine's aesthetic, dancers born after he died who talk about him as if they knew him.
It is those kinds of people who make Suki Schorer feel positive about Balanchine's legacy. A City Ballet member from 1959 to 1972, she wrote a book on Balanchine technique and has been teaching at the School of American Ballet for some 60 years. Asked about Balanchine's influence today, she listed young teachers, trained at the school, who have fanned out across the county.
Silas Farley is one. Born 11 years after Balanchine died, he encountered the Balanchine lineage at the school of North Carolina Dance Theater, which was run by the former City Ballet stars Patricia McBride and Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux. Farley became obsessed with Balanchine lore, which he absorbed deeply at the School of American Ballet and as a City Ballet member from 2013 to 2020.
"I have always had an acute sense that I'm one of the people who has been entrusted with a lot of these ideas and that, God willing, I'll be here a long time after the people who entrusted those ideas to me," he said on a call from Southern Methodist University, where he teaches.
His students, he said, are "empowered by all of Balanchine's cool amendments and extensions of classical technique. They delight in the granular and the grand, the nuances and the capacity to dance more expansively, more freely." Balanchine's works, he added, "are such a big part of their understanding of what ballet is."
Their understanding and everyone else's. Those works, however altered by time, remain ubiquitous. Nikolaj Hübbe, a Danish dancer who performed with City Ballet from 1992 to 2008 and has led the Royal Danish Ballet ever since, is one of those who believe in their enduring power.
"I don't think I've ever worked with a dancer, even if Balanchine was foreign to them, who did not have an epiphany, a wow feeling, dancing his ballets," Hübbe said. "Our dancers love them, revel in them. There's a logic that speaks to all classically trained dancers. The choreography sings well. I don't think that will ever go away."

Toyota's Electric Vehicles Could Use a Boost: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The world's largest carmaker dominates the sales of hybrid cars but has been slow to sell all-electric vehicles, alienating some customers and hurting sales.
Rachel Culin considered herself a Toyota loyalist, one of millions of people who appreciated the company's reliable and fuel-efficient hybrids. But she recently bought an electric Chevrolet Bolt to replace her Toyota Prius because the Japanese automaker had been too slow when it came to selling electric vehicles.
"Where are the options for those people who love Toyota?" Ms. Culin, a resident of Mesa, Ariz., said. "It's really sad."
Once the leading brand for environmentally conscious car owners, Toyota has failed to keep up with changing consumer preferences and a push by governments around the world to greatly reduce the burning of fossil fuels, the main cause of climate change.
The company and the Japanese auto industry are facing the biggest business challenge they have confronted since becoming global giants in the 1980s. How they respond could determine whether they remain at the top of the auto industry or become afterthoughts.
Toyota, the world's largest automaker, is the nucleus of power for the country's large auto industry. It has alliances with smaller automakers like Subaru and Mazda and wields enormous influence over government officials and industry groups. The company is also a major employer in the United States, with nearly 30,000 workers in Kentucky, Indiana, Texas and other states.
Its business decisions can have far-reaching economic and environmental implications. Toyota arguably did more to improve fuel efficiency and cut emissions than any other established automaker by pioneering hybrid cars that augment a gasoline engine with a battery and an electric motor. But having staked so much on hybrids, it has moved slowly to cars that produce no tailpipe emissions.
That has opened room for Tesla and BYD, a Chinese automaker, to challenge Toyota's dominance by offering appealing and affordable battery electric cars. Toyota has lost market share in the United States, and its sales in China have fallen.
Japanese carmakers have been here before. But last time they were the insurgents.
In the 1970s, with fuel prices soaring, Americans began replacing gas-guzzling cars with small, fuel-efficient Japanese models, challenging the dominance of General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler.
Toyota's manufacturing methods became synonymous with manufacturing efficiency, and many factories adopted what became known as the "Toyota way" or "Toyota method."
Today, Toyota is the one learning from rivals. The company is adopting techniques from Tesla. In China, it has teamed up with BYD in the hope of absorbing its electric motor and battery technology.
"The stage of the battle has changed," said Sanshiro Fukao, a senior research fellow at the Itochu Research Institute, and "the Japanese auto industry in particular has been very slow to act."
Toyota may no longer be able to take its time.
During the pandemic, the global automotive market passed a milestone that caught the world's major automakers flat-footed. In 2022, sales of electric vehicles surged nearly 70 percent to 7.7 million, surpassing those of hybrid-electric vehicles for the first time as demand skyrocketed in China, according to IDTechEx, a market research consultancy.
Toyota remains highly profitable, earning $ 8.9 billion in the quarter that ended on June 30. Last year, it sold 10.5 million vehicles, eight times as many as Tesla. But fewer than 1 percent of the cars it sold were fully electric vehicles.
The absence of electric vehicles has been especially costly in China, the world's largest car market. In July, Toyota's sales in China were down over 15 percent from a year earlier.
In the United States, Toyota's sales have increased, but less than other automakers. From June to August, the company's share of the passenger car market slipped to 13.8 percent from 15.1 percent a year earlier, according to the market research firm Cox Automotive.
The story is much the same for other Japanese automakers like Honda, Mazda and Subaru. Even Nissan, which began selling the Leaf electric car in 2010, has fallen behind, failing to produce a car that could rival Tesla's Model 3 in range, performance or design. Nissan accounted for less than 2 percent of the electric car market in the United States in the first half of the year. In China, it expects sales could drop by almost a quarter in the current fiscal year.
In May the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit organization, rated the 20 largest automakers on their progress toward zero emissions. Five of the six companies with the lowest scores were Japanese: Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda and Suzuki.
Foreign automakers in China produced electric models designed to placate regulators rather than appeal to consumers, said Christopher Richter, senior research analyst at CLSA, an investment firm.
"They didn't make them as great as they could, and they were behind the learning curve," he said.
Toyota has tacitly acknowledged that it has fallen far behind Tesla and BYD. The decision in January by the Toyota scion Akio Toyoda to step down as chief executive was widely seen as a recognition that the company needed new leadership to navigate the transformation of the auto industry.
The sense of urgency was compounded by the Shanghai auto show in April, said Tatsuya Otani, a journalist who has spent decades reporting on the Japanese auto industry.
Chinese vehicles at the show featured onboard controls and entertainment options that made them look more like iPhones on wheels than traditional cars. Japanese executives were stunned to see how much progress their Chinese rivals had made, Mr. Otani said.
Toyota declined to make executives available for interviews.
The only all-electric Toyota sold in the United States is the bZ4X, a sport utility vehicle that the company recalled last year because faulty bolts could cause the wheels to fall off -- an embarrassing misstep. In China, the company also offers an electric sedan, the BZ3. (Toyota's Lexus division sells one fully electric model in the United States and two in some countries.)
On returning from Shanghai, Toyota executives ordered employees to rush out a presentation on the company's plans for its electric vehicle production. Toyota shared the plan less than two weeks before the company's annual meeting, where shareholders, angered by the slow progress on battery-powered cars, proposed a resolution pushing the company to disclose its climate change lobbying.
The measure did not pass, but the rare expression of dissent was an indication of how Toyota, once praised as a paragon of clean tech, had fallen out of favor.
"They just are not moving quickly enough to E.V.s at a time when that is where the market and the planet are going," said Brad Lander, the comptroller of New York City, which owns more than $ 100 million in Toyota stock through its pension funds and backed the resolution.
The company has disputed that characterization, arguing that hybrid cars can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions more and faster than battery electric vehicles, which remain too expensive for many buyers.
Factoring in a cleaner manufacturing process for hybrid cars and the limited availability of critical battery materials, such as lithium, hybrids are a safer short-term bet, Toyota executives have said in recent public statements.
In Washington, the company has called for less stringent auto emission limits, saying in July that a proposed new standard "underestimates key challenges including the scarcity of minerals to make batteries, the fact that these minerals are not mined or refined in the U.S., the inadequate infrastructure and the high cost" of electric vehicles.
"When they do math, the effect on the environment is far greater for hybrids," said Jeffrey Liker, a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan and the author of several books on Toyota. "In addition to that, they make a whole lot more money."
Sales of all-electric vehicles are growing faster than hybrids. But some analysts predict that hybrid sales will surge as would-be electric vehicle buyers worry that the public charging network is inadequate and unreliable. If that happens, Toyota's strategy could be vindicated.
Anita Rajan, general director of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association in the United States, said Japanese automakers were biding their time until they could make electric cars that were as reliable and affordable as the gasoline vehicles.
"I don't know if there's a benefit in being first to market with these vehicles," Ms. Rajan said. "I think it's how you're entering the market and the thoughtfulness that you show for your customers."
In Toyota's home market, consumers have shown little appetite for battery electric cars, and the government has been reluctant to aggressively push for change in a profitable industry.
That could be a problem for Japanese carmakers, which have traditionally honed their technology at home before marketing it abroad, said Kazutoshi Tominaga, a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, which has worked with Japan's trade ministry to shape national electric vehicle policy.
"If Japan, as a market, doesn't shift to electrification, we don't have a place to test the product," he said.
Yet BYD has opened 10 dealerships in Japan and plans to have 100 by the end of 2025. The company went so far as to release a video in August calling on Chinese automakers to "demolish the old legends," widely interpreted as a reference to Japanese and Western automakers.
On a recent Sunday, prospective buyers waited patiently to take a BYD S.U.V. for a spin around the Tokyo neighborhood Ikebukuro. Salespeople were quick to point out the car's eligibility for thousands of dollars in subsidies from Japan's trade ministry, which has allocated $ 90 billion to promote battery electric cars.
Two nearby Toyota showrooms were largely empty.
Customers are "satisfied" with the current options, said Masaki Nagasawa, the deputy manager of a Toyota dealership in Tokyo. "For people who are wavering, subsidies are an incentive to buy," but most customers are anxious about electric cars' range and prefer hybrids, he said.
Toyota has said it is working on new production techniques and innovative battery technology that would increase its cars' range and reduce the time it takes to charge them. The company has said that its lineup will include 10 new all-electric vehicles by 2026 and that it will aim to sell 3.5 million of them annually by 2030.
Speaking on Wednesday in Tokyo after the unveiling of a new luxury plug-in hybrid vehicle, Simon Humphries, who is in charge of branding and design and is a director on Toyota's board, said the company was releasing new electric options "month by month, year by year."
But, he added, while there is an "urgency" to introduce new battery-powered cars, "there's urgency in every segment."
Electric vehicle companies are moving fast.
Tesla is on track to sell nearly two million electric cars this year and is building a factory in Mexico, where it is expected to make a car that sells for around $ 25,000. In the United States, the company's Model 3 sedan already sells for about as much as a comparably equipped Toyota Camry after federal and state incentives are taken into account.
BYD is rapidly expanding outside China, including in Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia. Its extensive electric lineup includes models that are cheaper than Toyota's most affordable sedans and a mammoth luxury S.U.V. that sells for around $ 150,000.
Just as Apple, Google and Samsung quickly displaced Nokia and BlackBerry in the mobile phone business, some analysts say, Tesla and BYD could be so far ahead in making electric cars by 2026 that Toyota might struggle to catch up.
But Japanese officials are more sanguine.
People own cars longer, so the transition will not be as fast as with cellphones, said Naoki Kobayashi, a deputy director of the trade ministry's automobile division.
He acknowledges that Toyota faces a big challenge, but, he added, "unlike with smartphones, we've still got time."

It's Monday. How a racist Instagram account turned a Bay Area community against itself. Plus, California is rethinking its future as its population stagnates.
A private Instagram account with just over a dozen followers might not seem like something that could cause much trouble.
But the discovery in 2017 of such an account, run by students, with racist posts shattered a Bay Area high school and its town. Friendships were destroyed, lawsuits were filed and the trajectories of lives were changed forever.
In a gripping account in The New York Times Magazine, Dashka Slater chronicled what happened at that school in the Alameda County community of Albany. The years of fallout from the Instagram account -- including sit-ins, families fleeing town and a court case that was appealed all the way to the Supreme Court -- illuminate how Americans think about race, social media and punishment. I highly recommend reading the full article.
I spoke to Dashka, who is based in the Bay Area, about her reporting and what it reveals about young people and hate incidents. This isn't her first foray into this world: In 2017, Dashka published "The 57 Bus," a nonfiction book about a teenager who identifies as agender -- neither male nor female -- and was set on fire by another teenager while riding a bus in Oakland. That book began as a New York Times Magazine article.
Here's my conversation with Dashka, lightly edited for length and clarity:
How did you come to this story? Why did it appeal to you?
I had just finished writing "The 57 Bus," and I had no intention of having teenagers and hate be my beat. But I was at an advance signing event for that book, and someone in the signing line mentioned what had just happened in Albany with the discovery of the racist Instagram account. As I began to investigate, I found that same sense of disturbed attraction, where I thought both: "I don't want to spend any time at all on this very disturbing, upsetting story" and "I want to know everything about this, and I want to understand all the issues that are kind of lurking beneath the surface about race and gender and justice and social media and shame and accountability."
This story takes place at Albany High School. Does it feel to be specific to the Bay Area? Or do you think such racial tensions could explode anywhere?
Well, it does happen everywhere. In 2019, the Southern Poverty Law Center sent a survey to school districts asking about hate incidents on campus for K-12 schools. And in the fall of 2018 alone, there were almost 3,300 separate incidents.
While I was reporting this story, one of the first things I did was set up a Google Alert for any time the words "school" and "hate" appeared together online. I get a Google Alert every day that has about eight things in it. Usually one or two of them are something similar to what happened in Albany.
What I heard a lot from people in Albany was, of course this happened in Albany, with its history of redlining and restrictive covenants and Ku Klux Klan activity in the 1920s. And, as I say to people, that's true all over. That's true in my city of Oakland, which is much more diverse than Albany, but also has that history of racially restrictive covenants and redlining and Ku Klux Klan activity. So this is very much an American story.
And, of course, there were all the particulars: it being a small town, it being in the liberal Bay Area where nobody thought this could happen, it having happened three months after Donald Trump was elected, when everybody was still kind of in a state of shock and wondering about the future of this country. All of those were contributing factors to the way it played out. But this does happen everywhere.
It has been six years since this happened, and, in some ways, Americans are probably thinking about race now more than they ever have. So I'm wondering if you think the hate incidents among young people are on the decline. Is that Google Alert still regularly pulling up these stories?
I always get a little lull during the summer, but last week I got my first alert of a hate incident since the spring. One of the things that have happened is that white nationalist groups have become emboldened, and they are very good at using social media to radicalize, indoctrinate and attract young people, particularly boys, particularly white and Asian boys. And so I don't see this, unfortunately, stopping this week or next week.

Where we're traveling
Today's tip comes from Susan Weikel Morrison, who lives in Fresno. Susan recommends Rosie the Riveter World War II Home Front National Historical Park in Richmond:
"The park commemorates the legacy of the U.S. home front effort to rapidly and abundantly supply the military during World War II and highlights especially the contribution of the Rosies, women who filled equipment construction jobs so that men could fight in the Pacific and Europe.
The attractive bayside park includes an informative visitors center; a preserved World War II Victory ship, the Red Oak Victory; and a restored Ford assembly plant that helped build combat vehicles during the war."

A matchmaking effort brought Emily Dobies and Sal Steiner together -- and yet they weren't the couple being set up.
Dobies was trying to orchestrate a match between Steiner and a mutual friend. "I was like, 'Sal's perfect -- for everyone,"' Dobies told The Times.
She and Steiner met in 2012 at a cafe in San Francisco, Coffee Bar, where they both worked. Dobies had long harbored a crush on her co-worker, though she never thought Steiner would share her feelings.
But in 2016, after the matchmaking attempt had taken place, something shifted. "You're the most attractive, magical person I've ever met," she told Steiner.
He turned to face her and said, "Wait, do you want to make out with me?" She rushed to say yes, adding, "ever since I met you."

We Can Eliminate These Deadly Diseases: [Op-Ed]

Full text: There was a time not so long ago when preventing epidemic disease was a cause ordinary people embraced and celebrated. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt called on Americans to join the fight against polio, for instance, he reported that envelopes containing "dimes and quarters and even dollar bills" arrived by the truckload at the White House, "from children who want to help other children to get well." The March of Dimes went on to fund the development of polio vaccines. When one of them, the Salk vaccine, proved effective, in April 1955, church bells rang out nationwide.
Likewise, in the mid-1960s, when the World Health Organization announced its wildly ambitious plan to eradicate smallpox in just 10 years, people rose to the challenge. Small teams bearing vaccines and a simple lancet called the bifurcated needle were soon moving through the afflicted parts of the planet -- by camel across the desert in Sudan, by elephant to ford rivers in India, and by all the more familiar modes of travel. People everywhere lined up to get the peculiar dimpled mark of smallpox vaccination, freeing them from the scourge that had been maiming and killing their families for as long as they could remember.
As many as 150,000 men and women at a time worked on the campaign, and with a final naturally occurring case discovered in Somalia in October 1977, they eradicated smallpox in the wild. For veterans of the "order of the bifurcated needle," as they called themselves, it was the proudest hour of their lives.
It may seem unlikely that we could ever recapture that determination and excitement about standing up together against a deadly disease. Instead of presenting a unified front against Covid-19, we fought bitterly, and three years on, our shared response seems to be a shellshocked unwillingness to even think about epidemic diseases.
Politicians have become particularly skittish about what ought to be common-sense steps to protect basic public health. The Pasteur Act, for instance, would address the antibiotic resistance crisis that threatens our entire system of medical care, but it's been stalled in Congress for years. Funding for federal pandemic preparedness programs comes up for reauthorization in September, but its passage is in doubt.
Given the catastrophic losses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, this type of inaction is baffling. Are emerging and evolving pathogens too elusive a target? Is the political payoff for these actions too small? Is the desperate desire to move on from the nightmare of the pandemic leading us to avoid the difficult realities of prevention?
I believe that the way to ease us as a nation back into the essential business of preventing infectious diseases is by focusing on pathogens we already know perfectly well and for which we have new tools to reduce or eliminate sickness worldwide. I'm thinking in particular of the very winnable fights against three diseases with a long history of maiming, crippling and killing humans: tuberculosis, malaria and polio.
The dark star of the three is tuberculosis. We haven't seen it much in the developed world since the arrival of antibiotic therapies in the 1940s, but as Covid deaths wane, tuberculosis has resumed its place as the deadliest infectious disease, killing some 1.5 million people a year, mostly in the developing world. The ability to cut that number dramatically is within our reach. The development of diagnostic technologies like GeneXpert has brought testing times for TB down from weeks to hours -- a crucial difference because at present, 40 percent of TB victims don't get diagnosed or treated. This failure doesn't just put people at risk. It also spreads the disease to those around them.
Treatment of tuberculosis with a regimen of antibiotics has also gotten easier, shortened from two years down to just six months for antibiotic-resistant cases. For normal drug-sensitive cases, treatment time is also likely to drop soon, from six months to four. Shorter is better because the multi-drug regimen is complicated and prone to side effects, and many patients give up. George Orwell experienced it in its crudest form at the start of the antibiotic era and likened it to "sinking the ship to get rid of the rats." (His own ship sank just 20 months later, killing him at age 46.) Promising new vaccines are also in the works.
As with so many infectious diseases, lack of determination is the real stumbling block. The United States and other donor nations could argue that we already do more than our share, contributing billions annually to the fight against TB and other infectious diseases. But donors still fall short by more than half on the funding the W.H.O. says it needs to end the TB epidemic by 2030. Until we get the job done, we need to have a broader sense of what "our share" could yet entail: Up to 13 million Americans currently live with latent TB infection, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The realities of modern travel mean that none of us is protected from a TB resurgence until we have protected people everywhere.
It's the same story with malaria, which used to sicken and kill Americans as far north as the Great Lakes until a well-funded federal initiative protected us. Consciously or otherwise, we then set malaria aside as a "third world" disease. In June, however, for the first time in two decades, homegrown malaria cases turned up in Texas and Florida, raising the specter that it might again become endemic in the United States.
That ought to serve as a reminder that an estimated 247 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide in 2021, and 619,000 people died. The vast majority of them were children under the age of 5 in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Malaria prevention has stumbled at times because of rapidly evolving resistance to drugs and insecticides. But we are now making major progress with a variety of new tools and a more coordinated and agile response.
Sixteen nations, from El Salvador to China, with efforts coordinated by the World Health Organization, have eliminated malaria since 2000, with another 10 countries aiming to stamp it out in the next two years. Moreover, public health agencies for the first time now have a vaccine against malaria, and about 1.7 million young children across three countries in Africa -- Ghana, Kenya and Malawi -- have already received at least one dose since the start of a pilot program in 2019. The vaccine is only moderately effective, but by preventing about 40 percent of cases of Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest malaria variety, it's expected to save tens of thousands of children every year. With proper funding to develop other necessary tools and get them into the field, the W.H.O. goal for this decade is to drive the annual malaria death toll down to well under 100,000 -- en route to eradication.
Polio, finally, offers the most immediate opportunity for a major success over infectious disease. In 1988, when international agencies, national governments and nonprofits launched an eradication campaign, polio was still endemic in 125 countries and every year paralyzed an estimated 350,000 people, mostly young children. This year, there have been just seven cases of wild poliovirus, all in one small, mountainous area on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the last two countries where the virus remains endemic. Both countries are now cooperating to stop it. They have eliminated wild poliovirus from major cities and Taliban-dominated regions where it was still circulating just a few years ago. Border crossings between the two countries now require polio vaccination. And vaccination teams, often with women taking the lead, routinely travel to remote and sometimes dangerous border villages to finish the job.
This is our moment to get rid of polio for good. If we fail, we could return to a time when polio paralyzed 350,000 people a year worldwide, some of them in the United States. Last summer's brief, horrifying reappearance of polio in New York State was a potent reminder of that threat. Americans may not have much interest in what happens outside our borders. But it makes sense to give till it hurts in the fight against these three diseases -- because not giving could ultimately hurt so much worse.
Politicians motivated by protecting their own popularity and legacies should also take note. Even Americans who loathe former President George W. Bush still honor him as a hero for launching the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. It slowed the spread of the disease and has saved 25 million lives so far.
Appealing only to our selfishness, though, is a mistake. What we need is a powerful sense of our shared humanity in the fight against some of our most ancient killers, and the courage and determination to win this fight now.

Full text: For a growing number of designers, dealers and collectors in their thirties, American antiques are hot.
This article is part of our Design special section about new interpretations of antique design styles.
Scroll through Erick J. Espinoza's Instagram feed, and you might think you've traveled back in time to the 1930s -- not the Art Deco version, but the version filled with hooked rugs, weathervanes and candlesticks betokening the era's American Colonial Revival, perhaps with the color saturation cranked way up.
"There's something so lighthearted about Americana. Even really serious and intense works of American folk art are still whimsical, graphic and humorous," said Mr. Espinoza, who is the 32-year-old creative director at the Hamptons design studio founded by Anthony Baratta. Mr. Espinoza especially loves the geometric patterns of game boards and quilts.
Mr. Espinoza's own house in Danbury, Conn., is a kaleidoscopic ode to a style he calls "Pop Art country." His equestrian-themed red, white and black bedroom is a particular tour de force.
For a growing number of designers, dealers and budding collectors in their thirties, Americana is back -- with a twist. Consider them the Bicentennial millennials.
In the mid-1970s, on the heels of Watergate and the war in Vietnam, American housewares manufacturers like Ethan Allen used the 1976 Bicentennial celebrations to unleash a wave of nouveau Colonial Revival designs. Overlapping as they did with that decade's craft mania, old-fashioned objects like spinning wheels, flags and eagle-themed wallpaper enjoyed an uncanny moment of cultural relevance.
Michael Diaz-Griffith, the executive director of the Design Leadership Network, a platform for interior designers and architects, said he has been anticipating a renewed interest in Bicentennial style for more than a decade.
A native of Alabama, Mr. Diaz-Griffith spent eight years working in various capacities at the Winter Show, an antiques, art and design fair held each January in Manhattan, cheering on people his age (he is now 36) who were falling in love with very old, very quirky objects even as postwar modernism seemed to be getting all the attention. In June, he published "The New Antiquarians: At Home with Young Collectors" (The Monacelli Press).
"Millennials aren't minimalists," he said.
In his book, Mr. Diaz-Griffith profiles lovers of Americana who have made their living spaces canvases for quirky dialogues with the past rather than pristinely accurate period rooms. He writes that the Brooklyn apartment belonging to Camille Okhio, a writer at Elle Decor magazine, is "a Pennsylvania barn ... airlifted to Lagos." Her collections are "as likely to draw upon refined Ngil masks, spare 17th-century ironwork, or elegant Shaker basketry as the International Style."
Audrey Gelman has also taken stock of the moment. The co-founder of the Wing, the now-defunct women's co-working space famous for its millennial pink walls and velvet-upholstered furniture, she currently runs a vintage and contemporary home goods boutique called the Six Bells in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn.
Ms. Gelman, 36, recalled that her grandfather often visited estate sales, bringing quantities of "primitive cows and wrought iron pig figurines" into her family's orbit when she was young. She said that for her clientele, including shoppers in their 20s with a taste for the simple life and teens intent on giving their college dorm rooms a pastoral spin, she wanted to create "a Venn diagram of Americana, English maximalism and Alpine Tyrolean style."
Ms. Gelman, who left the Wing as chief executive after some employees, including Black and brown members, complained of inequitable treatment -- an episode she declined to discuss -- thinks one reason for the renewed attraction to rustic Americana is technological. "For a generation younger than me, who grew up with omnipresent internet, this aesthetic represents greener pastures," she said. Each member of that generation believes, "I was born in the wrong era and I want to go home."
She added, "We've reached a saturation point with retail simulacra: Everything is a copy of a copy, and even things that started in Copenhagen are now at Wayfair." Americana, by contrast, is rooted in a time, place and culture.
Every design tells some kind of story, but American antiques -- from the mythmaking around Betsy Ross's flag at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition in 1876 to Bicentennial bric-a-brac -- are particularly freighted with meaning, and that meaning is continually being remade, said Thomas Denenberg, the director of the Shelburne Museum in Vermont.
"The high point of the Colonial Revival is really about creating community and common values for a vastly heterogeneous nation, and that almost creates the operating system for suburban America," Mr. Denenberg said.
Community building is a facet of Americana that Mr. Espinoza takes very seriously. "I'm first-generation American; my parents are both from Central America," he said. "They moved here in the late 1980s and they had my sister and me in Miami. I think that lends itself to being proud to be here and celebrating that in a way, even today; I love everything that's American-made."
Politically liberal, he shrugs off the reticence that many other progressives feel about displaying Americana; he doesn't want to let someone else identify what American stands for. "I was born here. I have the utmost privilege to be an American," he said.
According to Mr. Diaz-Griffith, the "New Antiquarians" author, antiques have long been conservative symbols, "but they aren't necessarily that intrinsically."
Many younger people, he said, have shifted their attention to the people and methods behind old goods. "We're learning that a huge number of top furniture makers and upholsterers in America were Black men," he said. "This rewrites the history of this furniture, through the labor they were proud of, their workmanship, and how we conceive of the dignity and artistry of craftspeople generally."
In 2019, Tiffany Momon, an assistant professor of history at the University of the South, created an especially rich resource with the Black Craftspeople Digital Archive.
"The decorative arts world can be very old and white," Ms. Momon, 37, said, recalling that one year she was the only Black scholar at Colonial Williamsburg's annual Antiques Forum.
She also found that a pervasive emphasis on connoisseurship tended to eclipse the information she found most absorbing: "I was interested in the builders, the makers, the stories of people behind these nice-looking objects," she said. The Black Craftspeople Digital Archive was the resource she needed for her own research, but couldn't find.
As for Americana, flags and eagles interest her less than the more nuanced symbolism of Poynor chairs, she said. Born into slavery, Richard Poynor was a 19th-century Black furniture maker in Williamson County, Tenn., who purchased his freedom in the 1850s.
"He built the first horse-powered chair factory in Tennessee," Ms. Momon said. "It became a family business, and a way of acquiring money, living well, making a name for his family." Today, she thinks about what owning a Poynor chair "means for agency and Black liberation, and the lives of freed Black people before the Civil War.
And Poynor continues to inspire contemporary furniture makers. Robell Awake, a 38-year-old in Atlanta, creates modern takes on a ladder-back chair with which Mr. Poynor was associated.
Last year, after receiving a grant from the Center for Craft in Asheville, N.C., he deepened his study of the craftsman's life and work and discovered a resonance between Poynor's chairs and carved Jimma chairs made in the region of Ethiopia where Mr. Awake's parents were born.
Mr. Diaz-Griffith says he believes that millennials and Gen-Zers are increasingly drawn to American antiques because new scholarship about material culture has short-circuited the stuffiness so often associated with the field. Add to that a postmodern approach to mixing and matching historical periods and a strong sense of I-like-what-I-like, and you have a recipe for thinking Americana is fascinating, fun and ripe for personal meaning.
"Younger people have adopted a kind of historicist mind-set, talking about Tom Ford's Gucci like it's the 18th century -- it's a form of critical inquiry and identification," he said. "Maybe you're seeing photos of Colonial Williamsburg, and it's exciting. You're here, you're American, wanting to belong to something and to be woven into the story."

At Festival, Adam Driver Backs Actors: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: His film "Ferrari," a big-budget indie from Michael Mann, is the kind of adult drama the major studios have shied away from.
The name placard on the dais said "A. Driver," and if you're making a Ferrari movie, you'd certainly better have one.
This particular Driver happened to be in high demand at the Venice Film Festival, which bowed on Wednesday and has mostly had to make do without famous movie stars as the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike prohibits actors from promoting films made by most major studios. But since the new Michael Mann-directed film "Ferrari" will be released domestically by Neon and internationally by STX -- two companies that aren't members of the group that Hollywood guilds are striking against -- its star, Adam Driver, was free to make the trip to Venice and add A-list appeal to a festival in dire need of it.
"I'm proud to be here, to be a visual representation of a movie that's not part of the A.M.P.T.P.," Driver said on Thursday at the news conference for the film, referencing the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. He praised the interim agreement devised by SAG-AFTRA that allows stars to promote independent films as long as their distributors agree with the terms the actors' guild is seeking.
"Why is it that a smaller distribution company like Neon and STX International can meet the dream demands of what SAG is asking for -- the dream version of SAG's wish list -- but a big company like Netflix and Amazon can't?" asked Driver, who has previously promoted Netflix movies like "Marriage Story" and "White Noise" in Venice. "Every time people from SAG go and support movies that have agreed to these terms with the interim agreement, it just makes it more obvious that these people are willing to support the people they collaborate with, and the others are not."
After the crowd at the news conference applauded, Mann added, "No big studio wrote us a check. That's why we're here, standing in solidarity."
You wouldn't think while watching it that "Ferrari" is an indie movie. With a reported budget of $ 95 million, this is the sort of lavish adult drama that Mann used to make for major studios all the time. But movies like "Heat," "The Last of the Mohicans," "Ali" and "The Insider," all films Mann made in the 1990s or early 2000s, have fallen out of favor in our superhero-saturated era, and expensive prestige releases like this one have recently struggled to break out at the box office.
Can the record-breaking success of Christopher Nolan's "Oppenheimer" reinvigorate the sort of big-budget dad drama that used to be a theatrical staple? "Ferrari" is counting on it, even if its fellow December releases, like "Wonka" and "The Color Purple," don't necessarily lend themselves to "Barbenheimer"-level portmanteaus. ("Wonkari" and "Ferple" just sound like off-brand Pokemon.)
Like Nolan's summer hit, "Ferrari" is about a midcentury visionary with a wandering eye: Driver's Enzo Ferrari is a racer-turned-automaker who's feuding with his wife (Penélope Cruz), hiding a mistress (Shailene Woodley) and trying to save his namesake company before it goes belly up. Mann tracks him during the summer of 1957, when it seemed like so many of Ferrari's problems could be fixed by a single, momentous race. If one of his drivers can win the dangerous, thousand-mile race Mille Miglia, Ferrari reasons, it would stoke enough demand to lift the company's fortunes. Still, his single-minded pursuit of that goal turns out to be a life-or-death matter with all sorts of unexpected casualties.

It may be hard now to conceive of "Ferrari" as a Driver-less vehicle, but over the many years that Mann tried to mount it, the director flirted with leading men like Robert De Niro, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, who went on to topline the Mann-produced "Ford v Ferrari" (2019). The 39-year-old Driver is called upon to play a man two decades older for most of the film's running time, but that gray-haired intensity actually suits him: His Ferrari is hard-nosed and compelling, like a too-serious MSNBC commentator who slowly attracts an ardent, horny fan base.
Regardless of whether "Ferrari" can chase the box-office success of "Oppenheimer," Driver said it was a miracle it was made at all, summing up the film's truncated production schedule and false starts in a way that his title character could understand.
"It's hard not to get philosophical about an engine -- the amount of pieces that have to come together, similar to films, and work on the exact right timing in the exact right moment," he said at the news conference. "And then there's the element of human intuition and reflex. It's a 50/50 marriage, and that's very much filmmaking."
When all those different elements manage to coalesce on a premium race car -- or a big-budget indie film -- it's beautiful, Driver said. "It also makes you aware of how many things could go wrong at any moment," he noted. "It's a special thing to be part of."

Full text: For evidence that all is not business as usual at Lincoln Center these days, look no further than its stately travertine campus, which, for much of the summer, was dominated by a giant glittering disco ball, pink and purple flowers painted on the sidewalk and a flock of 200 flamingo lawn ornaments.
"There are some who will reasonably eye-roll at this," said Henry Timms, the center's president and chief executive, standing on the plaza recently. "I get it. But it sends a message that we are here to have some fun."
"We can afford," he said, "to loosen up a little."
Since taking the helm in 2019, Timms has been on a mission to remake Lincoln Center. Having helped finally push through the long-delayed $ 550 million renovation of David Geffen Hall, he is working to forge closer ties with the city and to bring more diversity to the center's staff, board and audiences.
Now he wants to tear down the barriers that literally wall the campus off from Amsterdam Avenue, with its neighboring housing projects, schools and new developments. But as Lincoln Center rethinks its programming -- this summer's festival included hip-hop, K-pop and an LGBTQ mariachi group -- it has drawn some criticism for presenting less classical music and international theater.
This summer's festival -- which included more popular programming than in the past and choose-what-you-pay tickets for some events -- attracted more than 380,000 people, officials said, many of whom were new to the campus. Among them was Sandy Mendez, a saleswoman who lives in Washington Heights, and saw her first Lincoln Center performance, a comedy show, after coming across an advertisement at a community center. She took photos in front of the disco ball with her husband and two children.
"It feels like a dance club here," said Mendez, 42, "not a performing arts center."
It is the kind of observation that both Timms's admirers and his detractors might make.
Running Lincoln Center is not easy. The center acts as landlord to the independent arts organizations on its campus, including the Metropolitan Opera, New York City Ballet and the New York Philharmonic, but has little power over them, since each has its own leadership, board and budget.
Linc. Inc., as it's known, also presents its own work, which has sometimes led to tensions with constituents. Reynold Levy, its president for more than a decade, called his memoir "They Told Me Not to Take That Job." After he left, in 2013, Lincoln Center cycled through four leadership teams in five years before appointing Timms in 2019.
The British-born Timms, 46, who previously led the 92nd Street Y, helped create #GivingTuesday and co-wrote "New Power," a book exploring bottom-up leadership, including movements like #MeToo and social networks like Facebook. Now he is trying to apply some of those participatory principles at Lincoln Center. He said his efforts were not "some new trendy idea" but a response to the fact that the center has for too long been disconnected from the community.
"We very much came with an agenda, which was we were going to tell a different kind of story about Lincoln Center," Timms said, "to fundamentally shift the institution in terms of who leads it, who represents it, who's on our staff, who's on our stages, who's in our audiences."
"We have a long way to go as an organization -- nobody at Lincoln Center is taking a bow," he added in an interview at Tatiana by Kwame Onwuachi, the new restaurant at Geffen Hall that critics have named one of the best in the city. "But relative to where we were, I feel like we've made good progress."
Nevertheless, the reduction in programming, and the shift away from classical music and theater to other genres, has raised questions. Joseph W. Polisi, a former president of the Juilliard School who has written a history of Lincoln Center, said that Timms's vision was a "sea change" for the center that could come at a cost.
"It leaves a gap in music programming in New York City that is not being filled -- it can't be filled," he said. "All the artistic leaders I know are fully in support of more program diversity at Lincoln Center. Now the question is, how far does the pendulum swing?"
The critic Alex Ross recently wrote in The New Yorker that the new approach seemed "fundamentally out of step with Lincoln Center and its public, both extant and potential."
But Timms pushes back on such criticism, partly by pointing out that "we have just spent four years through a pandemic, and half a billion dollars, creating a concert hall to house the New York Philharmonic" and noting that the center had hired Jonathon Heyward, who recently became the first Black music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, to lead a reimagined version of the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra.
"Lincoln Center was founded as Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts; it was not founded as Lincoln Center for the Classical Arts," Timms said. "You go back to the beginning and there's a reason Mahalia Jackson was playing here. And it's not because we're only supposed to be about the opera and the ballet."
Summers at Lincoln Center look different now. The old Lincoln Center Festival was scrapped a few years before Timms arrived, and with it the large-scale, ambitious productions it brought each summer from around the world, including Noh theater and Kabuki theater from Japan, Indonesian dance and Chinese opera. Lincoln Center's programming is now overseen by Shanta Thake, its chief artistic officer, who was formerly an associate artistic director at the Public Theater. She and Timms have replaced the Mostly Mozart Festival, which had focused on classical music and recently celebrated its 50th anniversary, with the more eclectic Summer for the City festival.
"How do we build on this promise of being a performing arts center for all New Yorkers?" Thake asked. "How do we not rest on our laurels but push for what a performing arts center needs to be right now? Everybody's willing to have hard conversations."
The coming fall and winter season will feature an array of classical offerings, including a new production of Henry Purcell's "The Fairy Queen" and a performance of Philip Glass's piano études. There will also be more experimental fare in line with the center's new vision, including a reimagining of "The Sound of Music" through a "utopian, Afrofuturistic lens," featuring gospel, funk, soul and Afrobeat music.
Timms has also prioritized diversity backstage: of the 109 current members of the executive and senior management teams, about 60 percent are women and nearly 40 percent are people of color. In addition, the center recently started a two-year fellowship program to develop a diverse pipeline of potential board members for the resident organizations; three have been placed as trustees and three more have elections pending.
Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, who serves on Lincoln Center's board, praised Timms as a "once-in-a-generation leader" who "genuinely understands that diversity correlates with excellence."
The ballet dancer Misty Copeland, who joined Lincoln Center's board under Timms, commended his spearheading of the Amsterdam Avenue project, a long-neglected plan to make right Lincoln Center's initial razing of the low-income San Juan Hill neighborhood where the performing arts complex was built.
"He does not shy away from a history that may not look clean and sparkly," Copeland said. "I don't think I could imagine 10 years ago that this is where Lincoln Center would be."
Timms, whose mother was an illustrator from the United States and whose father was a British archaeologist, grew up in Exeter, England, where his family often attended regional theaters.
"Our childhood was full of ideas and the arts," he said. "We had access and experience and ownership. You felt like you were a part of something."
He graduated from Durham University in England and landed a job overseeing programming at the 92nd Street Y in 2008, where he helped start #GivingTuesday, a day of philanthropy after Black Friday and Cyber Monday that became a global success. In 2014, he was named the Y's executive director.
Steven R. Swartz, the new chairman of Lincoln Center, said Timms had won over the center's board with his energy and ideas, quickly recognizing the organization's main problems, including tensions with the constituents. "He just so quickly diagnosed what needed to be done," Swartz said.
And after years of false starts and bitter feuds, Timms built a good working relationship with the leaders of the Philharmonic -- he and Deborah Borda, who was the orchestra's president and chief executive, sometimes resolved disputes over coffee or martinis -- and finally renovated Geffen Hall. By accelerating construction during the pandemic shutdown, they were able to open the reimagined hall ahead of schedule.
"He was intent on moving past the history of animosity that existed between Lincoln Center and the New York Philharmonic," said Borda, who stepped down at the end of June. "He put a premium on working together. He was essentially the right man at the right time at the right place."
Katherine G. Farley, who stepped down as Lincoln Center's chairwoman in June, said Timms "has led the transformation of a traditional institution" and that he is "quick and eager to experiment."
"Not everything works out," she added. "When it doesn't work, he's quick to shut it down and try something else."
Like other arts institutions, Lincoln Center is still trying to recover from the pandemic shutdown, when the performing arts came to a halt for more than 18 months. The organization is spending less on programming than it did when Timms began his tenure: about $ 14 million in the fiscal year that ended in June 2022, down from $ 23 million in 2019, a decrease of about 40 percent that officials attributed in part to the fact that Geffen Hall remained closed for construction through the fiscal year of 2022.
But fund-raising remains relatively strong, and the endowment has risen to about $ 268 million, compared to $ 258 million in 2019. Moody's recently affirmed its A3 rating on the center's $ 356 million of debt but revised its outlook to stable from negative, noting the completion of Geffen Hall and the center's efforts to cut expenses and attract new audiences.
And relations have eased with the constituent organizations -- who historically competed with Lincoln Center for audiences, donors and attention.
"He's been very clear that it's the job of Lincoln Center to honor and pay attention to and try to help all the constituents that make up Lincoln Center," said Andre Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater. Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, said Timms had signaled to the constituents early in his tenure that the days of infighting were over. "Here was somebody who understood and really seemed to be listening," he said. And Damian Woetzel, the president of Juilliard, said Timms had proven "tradition is not at war with innovation."
On a recent day, a team of Lincoln Center staff members inside Geffen Hall was conducting research to prepare for the Amsterdam Avenue project, asking visitors where they spent time on campus and what they would like to do more of: attend cultural events? meet friends? play games? exercise? A poster explained the history of the San Juan Hill neighborhood and said: "Help us make our campus more welcoming!"
In a few hours, Timms would join a salsa band on the outdoor dance floor in a pair of coral-colored Nike Air Max sneakers.
"Changing with the world isn't just the right thing to do morally," he said. "It's the right thing to do strategically. And if leaders in a position like ours don't lead this change, what on earth are you doing?"

Trump Divides and Diminishes Michigan G.O.P.: [National Desk]

Full text: Infighting between Trump acolytes and traditionalists has driven away donors and voters. Can the Michigan Republican Party rebuild in time for the presidential election?
The Michigan Republican Party is starving for cash. A group of prominent activists -- including a former statewide candidate -- was hit this month with felony charges connected to a bizarre plot to hijack election machines. And in the face of these troubles, suspicion and infighting have been running high. A recent state committee meeting led to a fistfight, a spinal injury and a pair of shattered dentures.
This turmoil is one measure of the way Donald J. Trump's lies about the 2020 election have rippled through his party. While Mr. Trump has just begun to wrestle with the consequences of his fictions -- including two indictments related to his attempt to overturn the 2020 results -- the vast machine of activists, donors and volunteers that power his party has been reckoning with the fallout for years.
As the party looks toward the presidential election next year, the strains are glaring.
Mr. Trump's election lies spread like wildfire in Michigan, breaking the state party into ardent believers and pragmatists wanting to move on. Bitter disputes, power struggles and contentious primaries followed, leaving the Michigan Republican Party a husk of itself.
The battleground has steadily grown safer for Democrats. No Republican has won a statewide election there since Mr. Trump won the state in 2016. (Republicans have won nonpartisan seats on the State Supreme Court.) G.O.P. officials in the state are growing concerned that they do not have a top-tier candidate to run for the open Senate seat.
"It's not going real well, and all you have to do is look at the facts," said Representative Lisa McClain, a Republican from Eastern Michigan. "The ability to raise money, we've got a lot of donors sitting on the sideline. That's not an opinion. That's a fact. It's just a plain fact. We have to fix that."
She added: "Everyone is in the blame game. We've got to stop."
Michigan Republicans were long a force in national politics. The state was home to Gerald Ford and George Romney and to many of the "Reagan Democrats" who helped transform the party four decades ago. Ronna McDaniel, the current chair of the Republican National Committee, was the chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party until 2017. Betsy DeVos, the former secretary of education under Mr. Trump who resigned after Jan. 6, is a power broker in the state, managing vast wealth and a political network with influence far beyond state lines.
The slow unraveling of the state party began well before the 2020 election. Throughout the Obama administration, the right wing of the party grew more vocal and active. After Mr. Trump's victory in 2016, many party posts that were once controlled largely by megadonor families and the Republican establishment began to be filled by Trump acolytes.
By 2021, the new activists wanted to support only candidates who believed the 2020 election, which Mr. Trump lost in Michigan by more than 154,000 votes, was fraudulent and were committed to trying to do something about it.
Those leaders soon emerged. Matthew DePerno, a lawyer who advanced false election theories, became a folk hero in the state and ran for attorney general. Kristina Karamo, a poll worker who signed an affidavit claiming she had witnessed vote stealing, became a conservative media star and ran for secretary of state. And Meshawn Maddock, the leader of Women for Trump who organized buses to Washington on Jan. 6, became co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party.
Mr. DePerno and Ms. Karamo did not respond to requests for comment. The Michigan Republican Party did not respond to requests for comment. In a video released on Monday night, Ms. Karamo defended her actions as party chair and lashed out at more moderate Republicans she claimed were part of a "uniparty."
Their nominations exposed a rift within the party, with more moderate, traditional Republicans like the DeVos family swearing off both Mr. DePerno and Ms. Karamo and withholding funds from most of the state party. Other donors similarly expressed their frustration. County nominating conventions devolved into open conflict.
"Meshawn was never connected to the donor base, and so having her as the vice chair for a lot of us was a showstopper," said Dave Trott, a former Republican congressman from Michigan who retired in 2018 and is also a former donor to the state party. "Because we just knew she would never be someone that would be rational in her approach to state party politics."
Ms. Maddock, who is no longer involved in the party, responded to Mr. Trott, saying she was "not surprised at all that he takes no responsibility for disappointing Michigan voters or anyone."
"The state party needs the wealthy RINOs who often fund it to come to terms with what the actual voters on the right want," Ms. Maddock said. "Instead of constantly gaslighting the Republican base, the wealthy donors need to treat them with an ounce of respect for once."
As standard-bearers for the state party during the 2022 midterm cycle, Mr. DePerno, Ms. Karamo and Ms. Maddock all maintained the falsehoods about the 2020 election. In their campaigns, Mr. DePerno and Ms. Karamo placed extra emphasis on the 2020 election, often at the expense of other issues more central to voters.
They were resoundingly defeated. Republicans also lost control of both chambers of the State Legislature. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic incumbent, sailed to a landslide victory.
Republicans across the state were left pointing fingers. The state party blamed Tudor Dixon, the candidate for governor, for an unpopular abortion stance and anemic fund-raising. Ms. Dixon blamed state party leadership. Ms. Maddock blamed big donors for not supporting their candidates. Ms. Karamo refused to concede.
A state party autopsy days after the election, made public by Ms. Dixon, acknowledged that "we found ourselves consistently navigating the power struggle between Trump and anti-Trump factions of the party" and that Mr. Trump "provided challenges on a statewide ballot."
Ms. Karamo, who succeeded Ms. Maddock at the helm, pledged to bring in a new donor class. But those donors never materialized. The party has lost money since Ms. Karamo took over, with under $ 150,000 in the bank as of June 30, according to federal campaign finance records. At the same time four years ago, the party had roughly three times as much cash on hand.
She has drawn condemnation from both Republicans and Democrats for her social media posts tying gun reforms to the Holocaust and has faced attempts to limit her power.
The party has been plagued by infighting. In April, two county leaders were involved in an altercation, with one filing a police report claiming assault, according to video obtained by Bridge Michigan. In July, a brief brawl broke out during a state party gathering. The chairman of the Clare County Republican Party told police he had stress fractures in his spine, bruised ribs and broken dentures as a result of the fight.
A memo circulated this month from the executive director and general counsel of the state party, obtained by The Times, warned of a rogue meeting being advertised under the banner of the state party that was "in no manner properly connected to or arising from the true and real Michigan Republican Party."
The issues facing the party extend beyond infighting and fund-raising; this month, Mr. DePerno, as well as a former Republican state representative and a lawyer, were charged with felonies related to a plan to illegally obtain voting machines. They have pleaded not guilty.
"Tell me how that helps. Tell me how that helps get the swing voter," said Ms. McClain. "Voters don't care about the infighting. The swing voter wants to know, how are your policies going to help me have a better life for my family?"
Prominent Michigan Republicans appear content to let the state party wither. Former Gov. Rick Snyder, among the last Republicans elected statewide in Michigan, has begun a fund-raising campaign directing money away from the state party and directly into the House Republican caucus in a desperate attempt to win back at least one chamber of the State Legislature.
(The effort bears some similarities to one Gov. Brian Kemp undertook in Georgia, another state where division over Mr. Trump's election claims hobbled the state party.)
Mr. Snyder's fund-raising, as well as some activity from the DeVos family network, have filled the coffers of the Republican House caucus, led by Matt Hall, the minority leader in the State Legislature whom many party elites are looking to as the de facto leader. The House Republican Caucus, despite being in the minority, is outpacing the House Democratic Caucus in fund-raising this year, with $ 2.3 million to the Democrats' $ 1.7 million.
Mr. Hall also has helped fuel 2020 election doubts. (He once was the chairman of a committee hearing featuring the Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani spreading lies about the election.) But he is far more likely to attack Democrats on spending or "pork" projects.
Separate from Mr. Hall's efforts, the DeVos family and other influential donors have begun raising money for congressional and state legislative races only, forgoing any presidential or Senate races, according to Jeff Timmer, a former executive director of the state party.
But the problems looming ahead of next year's election are not just about money.
"What can't be replicated is the manpower infrastructure," said Mr. Timmer, who now advises the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group. "You can't just go out and buy the passion and zealousness of people who will go out knock on doors and put up signs and do all those things that require human labor in a campaign."
Prominent Republicans point to the coming Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference as a sign of how far the state party has fallen. It was once a marquee stop for presidential hopefuls looking to make an impression on the critical swing state, and not a single Republican candidate for president in 2024 is scheduled to make an appearance.
Instead, the featured speaker at the September conference will be Kari Lake, who lost her race for governor in Arizona and has since claimed her loss was marred by fraud.

Trump’s election lies spread like wildfire in Michigan, breaking the state party into ardent believers and pragmatists wanting to move on. Bitter disputes, power struggles and contentious primaries followed, leaving the Michigan Republican Party a husk of itself.
The battleground has steadily grown safer for Democrats. No Republican has won a statewide election there since Trump won the state in 2016. (Republicans have won nonpartisan seats on the state Supreme Court.) GOP officials in the state are growing concerned that they do not have a top-tier candidate to run for the open Senate seat.
“It’s not going real well, and all you have to do is look at the facts,” said Rep. Lisa McClain, a Republican from eastern Michigan. “The ability to raise money, we’ve got a lot of donors sitting on the sideline. That’s not an opinion. That’s a fact. It’s just a plain fact. We have to fix that.”
She added: “Everyone is in the blame game. We’ve got to stop.”
Michigan Republicans were long a force in national politics. The state was home to President Gerald Ford and Gov. George Romney and to many of the “Reagan Democrats” who helped transform the party four decades ago. Ronna McDaniel, the current chair of the Republican National Committee, was the chair of the Michigan Republican Party until 2017. Betsy DeVos, the former secretary of education under Trump who resigned after Jan. 6, 2021, is a power broker in the state, managing vast wealth and a political network with influence far beyond state lines.
The slow unraveling of the state party began well before the 2020 election. Throughout the Obama administration, the right wing of the party grew more vocal and active. After Trump’s victory in 2016, many party posts that were once controlled largely by megadonor families and the Republican establishment began to be filled by Trump acolytes.
By 2021, the new activists wanted to support only candidates who believed the 2020 election, which Trump lost in Michigan by more than 154,000 votes, was fraudulent and were committed to trying to do something about it.
Those leaders soon emerged. Matthew DePerno, a lawyer who advanced false election theories, became a folk hero in the state and ran for attorney general. Kristina Karamo, a poll worker who signed an affidavit claiming she had witnessed vote stealing, became a conservative media star and ran for secretary of state. And Meshawn Maddock, the leader of Women for Trump who organized buses to Washington on Jan. 6, became co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party.
DePerno and Karamo did not respond to requests for comment. The Michigan Republican Party did not respond to requests for comment. In a video released Monday night, Karamo defended her actions as party chair and lashed out at more moderate Republicans she claimed were part of a “uniparty.”
Their nominations exposed a rift within the party, with more moderate, traditional Republicans like the DeVos family swearing off both DePerno and Karamo and withholding funds from most of the state party. Other donors similarly expressed their frustration. County nominating conventions devolved into open conflict.
“Meshawn was never connected to the donor base, and so having her as the vice chair for a lot of us was a showstopper,” said Dave Trott, a former Republican member of Congress from Michigan who retired in 2018 and is also a former donor to the state party. “Because we just knew she would never be someone that would be rational in her approach to state party politics.”
Maddock, who is no longer involved in the party, responded to Trott, saying she was “not surprised at all that he takes no responsibility for disappointing Michigan voters or anyone.”
“The state party needs the wealthy RINOs who often fund it to come to terms with what the actual voters on the right want,” Maddock said. “Instead of constantly gaslighting the Republican base, the wealthy donors need to treat them with an ounce of respect for once.”
As standard-bearers for the state party during the 2022 midterm cycle, DePerno, Karamo and Maddock all maintained the falsehoods about the 2020 election. In their campaigns, DePerno and Karamo placed extra emphasis on the 2020 election, often at the expense of other issues more central to voters.
They were resoundingly defeated. Republicans also lost control of both chambers of the state Legislature. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic incumbent, sailed to a landslide victory.
Republicans across the state were left pointing fingers. The state party blamed Tudor Dixon, the candidate for governor, for an unpopular abortion stance and anemic fundraising. Dixon blamed state party leadership. Maddock blamed big donors for not supporting their candidates. Karamo refused to concede.
A state party autopsy days after the election, made public by Dixon, acknowledged that “we found ourselves consistently navigating the power struggle between Trump and anti-Trump factions of the party” and that Trump “provided challenges on a statewide ballot.”
Karamo, who succeeded Maddock at the helm, pledged to bring in a new donor class. But those donors never materialized. The party has lost money since Karamo took over, with under $150,000 in the bank as of June 30, according to federal campaign finance records. At the same time four years ago, the party had roughly three times as much cash on hand.
She has drawn condemnation from both Republicans and Democrats for her social media posts tying gun reforms to the Holocaust and has faced attempts to limit her power.
The party has been plagued by infighting. In April, two county leaders were involved in an altercation, with one filing a police report claiming assault, according to video obtained by Bridge Michigan. In July, a brief brawl broke out during a state party gathering. The chair of the Clare County Republican Party told police he had stress fractures in his spine, bruised ribs and broken dentures as a result of the fight.
A memo circulated this month from the executive director and general counsel of the state party, obtained by the Times, warned of a rogue meeting being advertised under the banner of the state party that was “in no manner properly connected to or arising from the true and real Michigan Republican Party.”
The issues facing the party extend beyond infighting and fundraising. This month, DePerno, as well as a former Republican state representative and a lawyer, were charged with felonies related to a plan to illegally obtain voting machines. They have pleaded not guilty.
“Tell me how that helps. Tell me how that helps get the swing voter,” McClain said. “Voters don’t care about the infighting. The swing voter wants to know, how are your policies going to help me have a better life for my family?”
Prominent Michigan Republicans appear content to let the state party wither. Former Gov. Rick Snyder, among the last Republicans elected statewide in Michigan, has begun a fundraising campaign directing money away from the state party and directly into the House Republican caucus in a desperate attempt to win back at least one chamber of the state Legislature.
(The effort bears some similarities to one Gov. Brian Kemp undertook in Georgia, another state where division over Trump’s election claims hobbled the state party.)
Snyder’s fundraising, as well as some activity from the DeVos family network, have filled the coffers of the Republican House caucus, led by Matt Hall, the minority leader in the state Legislature whom many party elites are looking to as the de facto leader. The House Republican Caucus, despite being in the minority, is outpacing the House Democratic Caucus in fundraising this year, with $2.3 million to the Democrats’ $1.7 million.
Hall also has helped fuel 2020 election doubts. (He once was the chair of a committee hearing featuring Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani spreading lies about the election.) But he is far more likely to attack Democrats on spending or “pork” projects.
Separate from Hall’s efforts, the DeVos family and other influential donors have begun raising money for congressional and state legislative races only, forgoing any presidential or Senate races, according to Jeff Timmer, a former executive director of the state party.
But the problems looming before next year’s election are not just about money.
“What can’t be replicated is the manpower infrastructure,” said Timmer, who now advises the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group. “You can’t just go out and buy the passion and zealousness of people who will go out knock on doors and put up signs and do all those things that require human labor in a campaign.”
Prominent Republicans point to the coming Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference as a sign of how far the state party has fallen. It was once a marquee stop for presidential hopefuls looking to make an impression on the critical swing state, and not a single Republican candidate for president in 2024 is scheduled to make an appearance.
Instead, the featured speaker at the September conference will be Kari Lake, who lost her race for governor in Arizona and has since claimed her loss was marred by fraud.

Full text: Warren Whyte and Khaleeqa Rouse met at Starbucks after being drawn to each other's photos on a dating app.
When Warren Anthony Whyte showed up at Starbucks to meet Khaleeqa Linda Rouse, he first mistook another woman for his date. "She didn't look like her photo, and I thought maybe it was her in this age of editing," he said.
Ms. Rouse turned up 15 minutes later, Mr. Whyte said, and she looked exactly like her photo. "Her striking beauty online to be replicated in real life -- that really solidified my first impression," he said. "And her personality was even more beautiful than her appearance."
The two matched on the dating app Hinge on June 13, 2021, and scheduled a first date a week later, on Father's Day, at a Starbucks cafe in Englewood, N.J.
Ms. Rouse, 39, was also impressed when she saw Mr. Whyte in person. "I was like, Wow, his pictures didn't do him justice -- he's striking," she said. "Warren is 6-foot-4 and has this presence."
"I wore a coffee-brown polo and khakis, a brown loafer and my Tom Ford shades," Mr. Whyte, 39, said.
As an only child and a self-described introvert, Mr. Whyte appreciated how easily their conversation flowed. "I was like, I want to hang out with her tomorrow," he said.
The date, though, caught Ms. Rouse by surprise. "I admittedly only allotted an hour for the date," she said. "I had low expectations, because I was in this season of just meeting new people. I remember seeing him and thinking, Damn, I played this all wrong. I was super casual, opting for sneakers and a skirt."

Ms. Rouse was also taken with Mr. Whyte's kindness and warmth. "He has this wonder in his soul," Ms. Rouse said. "I also felt very protected and safe around him, like I could, as my dad says, 'put my cutlery away."'
Their second date was on June 25, where they played tennis and then had lunch in Englewood. "He asked me out again the next day," she said. "We went to brunch at De Novo European Pub in Edgewater, N.J."
Their third date was an Italian cooking class, where they shared a first kiss. And by June 30, they were official.
On July 19, Mr. Whyte suddenly wanted to tell Ms. Rouse he loved her, he said. "But my nerves got the better of me, and instead I blurted something like, 'I am beginning to fall for you,"' Mr. Whyte said. "She was relieved, because she sensed my nervousness and thought I was going to break up with her."
In October 2022, Ms. Rouse moved into Mr. Whyte's apartment in White Plains, N.Y., where they now live.
The couple marveled at the speed with which their relationship progressed. "At first, I was heartbroken from a relationship ending and scared to get back out there," said Ms. Rouse, who eschewed dating for six years. "I found what made my heart sing, and I needed that."
Mr. Whyte was wounded, too, after separating from his wife of three years in 2020; their divorce was finalized in 2022. "When Khaleeqa came into my life, I had done enough work on myself," he said. "I felt ready."
Mr. Whyte was raised in Miami until he moved to Amawalk, N.Y., at 13. He works remotely as a vice president at ConcertAI, a health care technology company based in Cambridge, Mass. He has a bachelor's degree from Cornell and a doctorate from M.I.T., both in biology.
Ms. Rouse, who grew up in Englewood, is the founder and chief creative officer of Reel Well Media, an agency that produces social media content for personal brands. She has a bachelor's in finance and global business and a master's in business administration, both from Rider University in Lawrence Township, N.J.
On Christmas Day in 2022, Mr. Whyte proposed at Ms. Rouse's family home. He had planned to pop the question when they opened gifts in the morning, but a late start caused the day's plans to crumble. By the time they began opening presents late in the day, he had lost his nerve.
"I ended up confiding in Khaleeqa's grandmother and mother, who started crying and agreed to help gather the family together to say a prayer and give me the opportunity to propose," Mr. Whyte said.
But he froze again after the prayer. So Ms. Rouse's mother forced everyone to come back together for a second prayer. "This time, she held my hand as she led the second prayer, and then squeezed my hand as a signal to take over," Mr. Whyte said.
The couple married on Aug. 18 at Crabtree's Kittle House Restaurant & Inn in Chappaqua, N.Y. The ceremony was officiated by Theodore N. Stephens II, who is the acting prosecutor for Essex County, N.J., and a Universal Life minister.
The wedding had 60 guests in attendance. It included a land acknowledgment to the Lenape people and the tradition of jumping the broom, which, Ms. Rouse said, "really meant something to us and really felt like we left a part of our lives in the past, and we're moving into the future."

Anonymous Shredders Drop Secret Identities: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: For around 14 years, the Detroit hardcore collective has kept its members' identities secret. For "Perfect Saviors," it's breaking with its longtime sound -- and opening up.
There are bands that are challenging to get into, and then there is the Armed.
The Detroit-based punk outfit has operated largely pseudonymously for roughly 14 years, preferring renegade one-off shows at gas stations or rec centers to tours. Its self-produced, highly weird music videos have a "Jackass"-meets-David Lynch aesthetic, with surprisingly advanced production values for an obscure Midwestern hardcore group. Its rare interviews read more as absurdist gonzo journalism than traditional profiles: The Armed has shown up with blunt-smoking bodybuilders or driving a $ 200,000 Porsche, handed out false or even stolen identities, and provided Hegelian philosophical tangents in response to basic questions like, "Who, exactly, is in the Armed?"
For the better part of the group's history, keeping the answer to that question as obscure as possible has been part of the point. The Armed considers itself more of a collective or an art project than a band, with dozens of rotating members. The goal was to tamp down their egos and refocus the audience's attention on the music, which has been about as challenging to understand as their identities: blast beats, screeching guitars, screaming vocalists and layer upon layer of dense, maximalist and oftentimes dissonant noise rock.
Now, the Armed has a grand opportunity to capitalize on its years of toiling in relative obscurity. Modern, guitar-heavy rock is going through something of a renaissance, with young people looking to packed clubs and circle pits to find the type of release that no Zoom call could provide. Harder acts like Scowl, Gel and Zulu are thriving, and Turnstile, the Baltimore-based hardcore group, has found a way to bridge hardcore to the mainstream.
So members of the Armed are doing what might be their most punk-rock move yet: revealing themselves and taking a hard-right turn away from their signature sound. The result is a larger-than-life, anthemic stadium rock album due Friday called "Perfect Saviors," a near-complete break from their past that will likely alienate some of their biggest fans. But for those who know them well, it is a classic Armed move.
"A lot of what we're doing was a function of everyone in the hardcore scene hating us," Randall Lee, 39, one of the four core members of the band, said in a recent interview. (The others are Kenny Szymanski, 34; Dan Greene, 35; and Tony Wolski, 38.) "We weren't touring, and we got a lot of [expletive] for it from the gate-keeping crowd, so we made our own scene."
For years, many thought the group was secretly run by Kurt Ballou, a revered record producer and guitarist from the hardcore band Converge. Others believed it was backed by the skateboarding legend Tony Hawk.
Much of the group's lore centered around a persona called Dan Greene -- based on the actual band member Dan Greene, who is preternaturally shy and preferred to stay out of the limelight. Greene was portrayed publicly by Trevor Naud, a longtime friend and collaborator, while the real Greene worked largely in the background, providing elements of potential song ideas to other band members who would build on them to produce full-length tracks. Greene works a day job stocking shelves at Meijer, a Midwestern grocery chain, though he also hid in plain sight: He was photographed and placed on the cover of one of the band's early albums, "Untitled."
Some of the other members of the band began calling themselves "Dan Greene" in press interviews; fans started calling themselves "Daniels."
"It's an exquisite corpse of a band," Naud said, referencing the Surrealist parlor game of making artistic works out of disparate, oftentimes contradictory pieces.
If the music turned on new listeners, the saga of Dan Greene and the music videos hooked them in. Naud became something of an avatar for the entire group, often playing a disaffected man trying to break out of corporate life, or running into crowded bars with a hacked-together karaoke system strapped to his back and screaming his lungs out. The Armed pulled in the voice actor David Hayter, who played Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid video game series, in one of its most Lynchian visual pieces, for the single "An Iteration."
"Everything is art-forward with them," said Troy Van Leeuwen, a multi-instrumentalist for Queens of the Stone Age who acted as "guitar czar" on the Armed's two most recent albums. (Ben Chisholm, a producer and frequent Armed collaborator, passed him some early demos.) "They were mysterious, super impressive and what they were doing would just suck you in."
Much of the skill put into polishing the Armed's slick-looking videos stems from its adjacency to Worldfare, a production company created and run by multiple band members. Six partners, including Wolski -- the charismatic frontman who is ostensibly the band's leader, as much as the Armed can even have one -- built Worldfare into a creative studio housed inside a 5,000-square-foot, three-story mansion near downtown Detroit. The compound has floors dedicated to filming, editing and entertaining, and a basement converted into a band practice and recording space. Worldfare has done advertising work with clients as big as Ford and McDonald's, as well as video shoots for bands like Tegan and Sara, Metz and Converge.
The Armed's fourth and biggest album yet arrived in 2021: "Ultrapop," a cultural critique on how subversiveness itself has been subsumed into modern pop culture. "When you can buy a skull T-shirt at Walmart, how subversive is that?" Wolski asked. "When Black Flag tattoos have been commoditized and made into an aesthetic, what even is punk anymore?"
To make their point, band members spent time during Covid lockdowns trimming down and bulking up, altering their diets and bodies to align with the maximalist sound of the record. Lee, the longhaired, Viking-sized guitarist and vocalist, shed 100 pounds to maintain a six-pack. Along with Wolski and his cousin Szymanski, who plays bass in the group, Lee hired a professional nutritionist; Wolski now subscribes to a mail-away chicken service and eats at least five meals a day of lean protein. Buzz began circulating after the group showed off its new look at the Pitchfork Festival in 2022 backed by Cara Drolshagen -- a longtime collaborator and the band's screamer-in-chief -- and two carbon copies of her, all made up in Juggalo face paint.
For "Perfect Saviors," the band is unmasking even further. Wolski and others sat down with the Fader writer Dan Ozzi and introduced some of the group's newer additions, like the saxophonist Patrick Shiroishi and the drummer Urian Hackney of Rough Francis.
"We wanted to be a reliable narrator for this album," Wolski said. "We really believe in this. There's no 'wink' in it." He said he thought the band was becoming a "mystery to be solved," distracting people from actually caring about the music.
Fans are still working their way through what it means to know the actual identities of the Armed -- even if some of them don't fully believe it. (A LexisNexis search for Wolski returned a phone number matching the cellphone he used when communicating for this profile.)
That lack of certainty, it turns out, collides with some of the central themes of "Perfect Saviors." Wolski noted how confusing the world has grown in an age of continuous connection; how information overload has made people stupid; and how social media's need for us to constantly perform turns everyone into celebrities. "Our world is confounding and terrifying because of all of this, but it is still beautiful," he added.
The result is the group's most polished -- and likely most accessible -- record to date. "Sport of Form," the album's lead single, features heavy synths and harmonies interspersed with gentle acoustic guitars and a guest spot from Julien Baker, of boygenius fame. (Iggy Pop stops by to play the role of "God" in the music video.) There are even piano solos and ballads.
"They have this subversive plan to absolutely steamroll their way through conventions," noted Justin Meldal-Johnsen (Beck, Nine Inch Nails, M83), who played bass on a handful of the new tracks.
But Wolski and company still don't want to fully escape their roots. Before setting out on tour supporting Queens of the Stone Age in early August, the Armed sent out a notice to its loyal devotees: The group was throwing one last renegade, unlicensed house show at a secret location in a Detroit suburb, free of charge.
More than a hundred fans packed into a century-old, three-story mansion in Detroit's Boston-Edison district 10 days later as the Armed played a blistering half-hour set inside a living room. The crowd was a mass of young, sweating bodies, moshing and crowd-surfing while trying to avoid kicking out the light fixtures on the ceiling.
Jezzy Maloney, a 24-year-old Detroit native, knew she had to attend the show after diving into the band's catalog and embracing its buff makeover last year.
"Literally the day after I watched that video, I started going to the gym again," she said of "All Futures." At the house show, Maloney and five others got tattoos of the Armed's logo -- an angular play on an infinity symbol -- in a parlor room adjacent to where the band was playing. They left at five o'clock in the morning the next day.
"There's just nothing like them that I've ever encountered," Maloney added. "It really has changed my life."

Full text: He is known as the Minister for Everything. From the government offices of Indonesia's capital to dusty mines on remote islands, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan commands authority as the nation's essential power broker.
A four-star general turned business magnate turned cabinet officer, Mr. Luhut aspires to transform Indonesia into a hub for the production of electric vehicles. But as he pursues that paramount goal, he and his country are increasingly vulnerable to geopolitical forces beyond their control. Though this archipelago nation has long sidestepped entanglements in ideological rivalries, it is increasingly caught in the conflict between the United States and China.
At stake is control over nickel, a mineral used to make batteries for electric cars and motorcycles -- a central component of the mission to limit the ravages of climate change.
Indonesia boasts the earth's largest reserves, making it something like the Saudi Arabia of nickel. But harvesting and refining those stocks is largely dependent on investment and technology from Chinese companies. And that has limited Indonesia's access to the United States.
In Washington, the Biden administration has proffered tens of billions of dollars in tax credits to spur electric vehicle manufacturing. To qualify, cars sold in the United States must include an increasing share of parts and materials produced either in domestic factories or in countries deemed friendly to American interests.
In recent months, Mr. Luhut -- formally Indonesia's coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment -- has implored the Biden administration for a trade deal covering minerals in an effort to secure his country status as a friendly country. That would generate greater demand for its nickel by making it eligible for the American tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. Companies around the globe would presumably gain incentive to erect smelters and electric vehicle factories in Indonesia, enhancing the nation's technological prowess, and creating jobs.
But Mr. Luhut, the government's de facto lead official on trade matters, has been repeatedly rebuffed because of American concerns about Chinese investment in Indonesia's nickel industry, as well as unease over working conditions and environmental standards. In Washington today, countering China's technological ascendance is that rare objective that captures support on both sides of the political aisle.
Some within the Biden administration argue that this stance is shortsighted. Climate change is an existential threat. Nickel is a central component of the transition away from fossil fuels, making access to Indonesia's stocks an objective of greatest urgency. But that logic has failed to win over powerful administration figures -- especially on the National Security Council -- who maintain that nothing should be subordinated to limiting China's might.
All of which explained Mr. Luhut's tone of weary indignation on a recent morning as he held court in his glass-fronted office at his residence in Jakarta, Indonesia's teeming capital. Outside in his garden, magpies whistled emphatically in cages hung from orchid trees. Inside, the Minister for Everything lamented the pernicious misconceptions separating his nation from its destiny.
"America doesn't understand what Indonesia is doing," he said. "It's frustrating."
Money and Power
At 76, Mr. Luhut remains wiry, spry and prone to nationalist pique. He vehemently rejects the notion that Indonesia -- a country of nearly 280 million people -- must pick a side or imperil its business with the United States.
"This country is too big to lean toward any superpower," he said.
The animosity between the United States and China was not the only issue causing him angst. He was incensed by the stance of the European Union, which has challenged a key tenet of Indonesia's industrial designs: a ban on the export of nickel ore.
In refusing to sell its raw nickel to the world, Indonesia has drawn more than $ 14 billion in investment, primarily from Chinese companies, into smelters that process it into products used to make stainless steel and E.V. batteries. Since the ban was introduced in 2014, Indonesia's exports of nickel products have multiplied more than tenfold, exceeding $ 30 billion last year, according to government data.
The European Union asserts that its companies are being deprived of a fair chance to import nickel ore. It brought and won a case at the World Trade Organization, gaining the power to apply punitive tariffs on Indonesia's exports even as the country appeals.
Mr. Luhut likens that position to a perpetuation of the colonial era, when the Dutch, Portuguese and British hauled spices, sugar and other lucrative commodities back to European entrepôts. The nickel export ban is a corrective, he said, the means of securing the value of extraction for Indonesians.
"It's the arrogance of European countries," he said. "Maybe they thought that Indonesia is still colonized. We have the right now to improve the quality of life in this country."
His righteous words coincide with the crude interplay of money and state power that has long animated Indonesian commerce.
Mr. Luhut earned his fortune in the business of coal, still the dominant way the country generates electricity. His company, TBS Energy, which trades on the Jakarta stock exchange, is now effectively controlled by his nephew, Pandu Sjahrir, who also heads Indonesia's leading coal industry trade association. The company is intent on placing itself at the center of the "electrical vehicle ecosystem," according its most recent annual report.
Nearly 62 percent of TBS Energy shares are owned by a Singapore-registered company, Highland Strategic Holdings, that is itself controlled by another holding company, which is in turn owned by a third entity, masking the real beneficiaries. Mr. Luhut does not appear in the paperwork maintained by Singapore regulators, but he still owns 8 percent of his old company, he said, positioning him to profit from new smelters.
Allies and rivals alike accuse Mr. Luhut of sharing in the proceeds of the Chinese-invested nickel ventures.
"It's widely known among Jakarta business and political elites that Luhut, through his proxies, has engineered side deals for himself," said a former Indonesian senior government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation from on high.
Mr. Luhut scoffed at such talk.
"If they give me 10 million dollars cash, where do I put this money?" he said. "I'm not going to jeopardize my reputation because of $ 10 million."
He flashed a raffish grin.
"If they give me $ 2 billion," he added, "maybe I'd consider it."
A Critical Need
Mr. Luhut describes his plans for nickel as the centerpiece of his efforts to spread the benefits of economic development beyond Indonesia's largest cities, where a thriving middle class throngs shopping malls, and on to impoverished communities.
Most of the nickel is on Sulawesi, a K-shaped, jungle-draped island that is roughly the size of Oklahoma. Despite its expanse, Sulawesi has long been an outlier in a nation of 17,000 islands whose political and economic spheres are dominated by the one that holds the bulk of the population: Java.
In communities near new smelters, many celebrate an infusion of new jobs, even as people denounce horrific pollution. Local workers complain that they are paid far less than those from China.
Early this year, roughly 3,000 workers staged a protest at a smelter in Central Sulawesi owned by PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry, a subsidiary of a Chinese company, Jiangsu Delong Group. The workers were enraged by a series of fatal accidents, and what they described as a dearth of protective gear and disparities in pay. As they set fire to vehicles, destroyed dorms and clashed with local security, two people died, including a Chinese national.
A special military force that answers to Mr. Luhut was dispatched to the site, unleashing tear gas to disperse the crowd.
"We have to guarantee security for investors," said Constantinus Rusmanto, then the commander of the special force and now an aide to Mr. Luhut. "We make sure that everything here is good for investment."
But some investors are alarmed by such tensions -- especially companies from North America, Europe and Australia, where the reputational consequences of unsavory business can be enormous.
Mr. Luhut's security apparatus is calibrated to the wants of businesses from China, where labor unions are banned and environmental and workplace standards can be readily skirted. In Washington, accounts of upheaval at Chinese-invested factories strengthen those opposed to extending Indonesia a trade deal.
Yet in Jakarta, the concept that Indonesia must apologize for its dealings with Chinese companies prompts derision. Government officials say they welcome investment from any place that brings capital and know-how. Chinese firms arrived early, recognizing the importance of nickel in the emerging realm of electric vehicles.
"The U.S. is missing in action," said Arsjad Rasjid, chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce. "It's not about us wanting to work with the Chinese. It's that they are here."
Experts accuse the United States of myopia in not embracing a trade deal with Indonesia, noting that Americans are already driving cars that use nickel mined there. The only question is which factories wind up making the batteries: those in China that now purchase nearly all of Indonesia's nickel products, or new factories in the United States.
By 2035, more than 90 percent of all nickel products will be processed in countries that lack free-trade agreements with the United States, according to a recent study by S&P Global, a research firm. That makes it impossible for American battery factories to satisfy their demand for nickel without looking to countries beyond core U.S. trading partners.
"One way or another, Europe and the U.S. will need Indonesia nickel," said Putra Adhiguna, an electric vehicle specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis in the Indonesian city of Bandung. "They should be coming to this country figuring out how they can do it better."
The White House declined to discuss the particulars of its talks with Indonesian officials, while suggesting that deliberations continue.
"Indonesia is an important partner for fighting climate change and accelerating the clean energy transition," said a spokesman for the National Security Council, Eduardo Maia Silva. "We continue to consult with stakeholders and Congress on implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, and we remain interested in coordinating with Indonesia, just as we are with other partners, to strengthen the resilience of our critical minerals supply chains."
Without a trade deal that can extend American tax credits to Indonesian minerals, many anticipate that the advent of electric vehicles will be hampered by a crude division: producers that rely on Chinese investment, and those that don't.
Mr. Pandu, Mr. Luhut's nephew, oversees a start-up called Electrum, which is designing an electric motorcycle geared to maneuvering through Jakarta's legendary traffic jams. The company is a joint venture between Mr. Luhut's old company, TBS, and GoTo, a digital business that includes Gojek, a popular ride hailing platform.
Electrum is building a factory in West Java to assemble motorcycles using parts imported from China. But Mr. Pandu envisions eventually drawing on domestic factories.
The key, he said, is holding firm on the nickel export ban and attracting foreign investment.
"The market in Indonesia is big enough," he said.
Alternate Plans
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Luhut sat at the head of a conference table at his ministry office, facing a half-dozen advisers. They tucked into lunches assembled at a buffet table -- gado gado, a vegetable salad topped with peanut sauce; rendang, hunks of spicy stewed meat; fried rice.
The conversation centered on how to persuade Tesla, the electric car pioneer, to set up a factory in Indonesia. Mr. Luhut was about to visit the United States to beseech Tesla's tempestuous chief executive, Elon Musk.
His advisers fretted that Tesla would not come, given that most of the electricity in Indonesia is powered by coal. Still, they took hope from the fact that Ford Motor recently entered a joint venture to construct a nickel processing plant in Sulawesi. That plant is to be powered by a hydroelectric dam.
A wall outside Mr. Luhut's office displayed a photo of himself in military regalia, receiving a medal at a special forces academy in North Carolina in the late 1970s. His father attended Cornell and Columbia before working as an engineer for an American oil company, Caltex. Mr. Luhut studied public policy at George Washington University, living happily in the U.S. capital, he said. His son lives in New York. His granddaughter is enrolled at Georgetown.
He feels comfortable in the United States, he said, describing a national affinity.
Still, in China, he is accorded extraordinary respect.
"They know how to deal with us," he said. "They know how to treat us."
Wang Yi -- China's top-ranking diplomat -- handles his itinerary when he visits, arranging meetings with executives of companies eyeing investments in Indonesia, Mr. Luhut said. Even during the pandemic, when officials had to quarantine for 14 days after a face-to-face meeting with a foreigner, he could visit anyone he chose.
He and his advisers discussed a pending announcement: a drastic slashing of import duties on electric vehicles to give Tesla a taste of the Indonesian market.
But the next week, Tesla outlined plans to set up a Southeast Asian headquarters in Malaysia, Indonesia's bitter rival, dealing Mr. Luhut a humiliation.
He was readying a backup plan, redoubling efforts to attract BYD, China's largest electric vehicle manufacturer.
His advisers quietly acknowledged that the American tax credits were not happening, not with the pushback in Congress after the Biden administration completed a minerals deals with Japan.
The Minister for Everything was absorbed with hawking nickel.
"We are aiming basically to the United States," he said. "But if the Americans finally say, 'We don't want to take it,' fine, we'll look for some other places to go."

JAKARTA, Indonesia — He is known as the Minister for Everything. From the government offices of Indonesia’s capital to dusty mines on remote islands, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan commands authority as the nation’s essential power broker.
A four-star general turned business magnate turned Cabinet officer, Luhut aspires to transform Indonesia into a hub for the production of electric vehicles. But as he pursues that paramount goal, he and his country are increasingly vulnerable to geopolitical forces beyond their control. Though this archipelago nation has long sidestepped entanglements in ideological rivalries, it is increasingly caught in the conflict between the United States and China.
At stake is control over nickel, a mineral used to make batteries for electric cars and motorcycles — a central component of the mission to limit the ravages of climate change.
Indonesia boasts the Earth’s largest reserves, making it something like the Saudi Arabia of nickel. But harvesting and refining those stocks is largely dependent on investment and technology from Chinese companies. And that has limited Indonesia’s access to the United States.
In Washington, the Biden administration has proffered tens of billions of dollars in tax credits to spur electric vehicle manufacturing. To qualify, cars sold in the United States must include an increasing share of parts and materials produced either in domestic factories or in countries deemed friendly to American interests.
In recent months, Luhut — formally, Indonesia’s coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment — has implored the Biden administration for a trade deal covering minerals in an effort to secure his country status as a friendly country. That would generate greater demand for its nickel by making it eligible for the American tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. Companies around the globe would presumably gain incentive to erect smelters and electric vehicle factories in Indonesia, enhancing the nation’s technological prowess, and creating jobs.
But Luhut, the government’s de facto lead official on trade matters, has been repeatedly rebuffed because of American concerns about Chinese investment in Indonesia’s nickel industry, as well as unease over working conditions and environmental standards.

But that logic has failed to win over powerful administration figures — especially on the National Security Council — who maintain that nothing should be subordinated to limiting China’s might.
All of which explained Luhut’s tone of weary indignation on a recent morning as he held court in his glass-fronted office at his residence in Jakarta, Indonesia’s teeming capital.

DETROIT — There are bands that are challenging to get into, and then there is the Armed.
The Detroit-based punk outfit has operated largely pseudonymously for roughly 14 years, preferring renegade one-off shows at gas stations or rec centers to tours. Its self-produced, highly weird music videos have a “Jackass”-meets-David Lynch aesthetic, with surprisingly advanced production values for an obscure Midwestern hardcore group. Its rare interviews read more as absurdist gonzo journalism than traditional profiles: The Armed has shown up with blunt-smoking bodybuilders or driving a $200,000 Porsche, handed out false or even stolen identities, and provided Hegelian philosophical tangents in response to basic questions such as “Who, exactly, is in the Armed?”
For the better part of the group’s history, keeping the answer to that question as obscure as possible has been part of the point. The Armed considers itself more of a collective or an art project than a band, with dozens of rotating members. The goal was to tamp down their egos and refocus the audience’s attention on the music, which has been about as challenging to understand as their identities: blast beats, screeching guitars, screaming vocalists and layer upon layer of dense, maximalist and oftentimes dissonant noise rock.
Now, the Armed has a grand opportunity to capitalize on its years of toiling in relative obscurity. Modern, guitar-heavy rock is going through something of a renaissance, with young people looking to packed clubs and circle pits to find the type of release that no Zoom call could provide. Harder acts such as Scowl, Gel and Zulu are thriving, and Turnstile, the Baltimore-based hardcore group, has found a way to bridge hardcore to the mainstream.
So, members of the Armed are doing what might be their most punk-rock move yet: revealing themselves and taking a hard-right turn away from their signature sound. The result is a larger-than-life, anthemic stadium rock album due Friday called “Perfect Saviors,” a near-complete break from their past that will probably alienate some of their biggest fans. But for those who know them well, it is a classic Armed move.
“A lot of what we’re doing was a function of everyone in the hardcore scene hating us,” Randall Lee, 39, one of the four core members of the band, said in a recent interview. (The others are Kenny Szymanski, 34; Dan Greene, 35; and Tony Wolski, 38.) “We weren’t touring, and we got a lot of [expletive] for it from the gate-keeping crowd, so we made our own scene.”
For years, many thought the group was secretly run by Kurt Ballou, a revered record producer and guitarist from the hardcore band Converge. Others believed it was backed by skateboarding legend Tony Hawk.
Much of the group’s lore centered on a persona called Dan Greene — based on actual band member Dan Greene, who is preternaturally shy and preferred to stay out of the limelight. Greene was portrayed publicly by Trevor Naud, a longtime friend and collaborator, while the real Greene worked largely in the background, providing elements of potential song ideas to other band members who would build on them to produce full-length tracks. Greene works a day job stocking shelves at Meijer, a Midwestern grocery chain, although he also hid in plain sight: He was photographed and placed on the cover of one of the band’s early albums, “Untitled .”
Some of the other members of the band began calling themselves “Dan Greene” in press interviews; fans started calling themselves “Daniels.”
“It’s an exquisite corpse of a band,” Naud said, referencing the surrealist parlor game of making artistic works out of disparate, oftentimes contradictory pieces.
If the music turned on new listeners, the saga of Dan Greene and the music videos hooked them in. Naud became something of an avatar for the entire group, often playing a disaffected man trying to break out of corporate life, or running into crowded bars with a hacked-together karaoke system strapped to his back and screaming his lungs out. The Armed pulled in voice actor David Hayter, who played Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid video game series, in one of its most Lynchian visual pieces, for the single “An Iteration.”
“Everything is art-forward with them,” said Troy Van Leeuwen, a multi-instrumentalist for Queens of the Stone Age who acted as “guitar czar” on the Armed’s two most recent albums. (Ben Chisholm, a producer and frequent Armed collaborator, passed him some early demos.) “They were mysterious, super impressive, and what they were doing would just suck you in.”
Much of the skill put into polishing the Armed’s slick-looking videos stems from its adjacency to Worldfare, a production company created and run by multiple band members. Six partners — including Wolski, the charismatic frontman who is ostensibly the band’s leader, as much as the Armed can even have one — built Worldfare into a creative studio housed inside a 5,000-square-foot, three-story mansion near downtown Detroit.
The compound has floors dedicated to filming, editing and entertaining, and a basement converted into a band practice and recording space. Worldfare has done advertising work with clients as big as Ford and McDonald’s, as well as video shoots for bands such as Tegan and Sara, Metz and Converge.
The Armed’s fourth and biggest album yet arrived in 2021: “Ultrapop,” a cultural critique on how subversiveness itself has been subsumed into modern pop culture. “When you can buy a skull T-shirt at Walmart, how subversive is that?,” Wolski asked. “When Black Flag tattoos have been commoditized and made into an aesthetic, what even is punk anymore?”
To make their point, band members spent time during COVID-19 lockdowns trimming down and bulking up, altering their diets and bodies to align with the maximalist sound of the record. Lee, a longhaired, Viking-sized guitarist and vocalist, shed 100 pounds to maintain a six-pack. Along with Wolski and his cousin Szymanski, who plays bass in the group, Lee hired a professional nutritionist; Wolski now subscribes to a mail-away chicken service and eats at least five meals of lean protein a day. Buzz began circulating after the group showed off its new look at the Pitchfork Festival in 2022 backed by Cara Drolshagen — a longtime collaborator and the band’s screamer-in-chief — and two carbon copies of her, all made up in Juggalo face paint.
For “Perfect Saviors,” the band is unmasking even further. Wolski and others sat down with The Fader writer Dan Ozzi and introduced some of the group’s newer additions, including saxophonist Patrick Shiroishi and drummer Urian Hackney of Rough Francis.
“We wanted to be a reliable narrator for this album,” Wolski said. “We really believe in this. There’s no ‘wink’ in it.” He said he thought the band was becoming a “mystery to be solved,” distracting people from actually caring about the music.
Fans are still working their way through what it means to know the actual identities of the Armed — even if some of them don’t fully believe it. (A LexisNexis search for Wolski returned a phone number matching the cellphone he used when communicating for this profile.)
That lack of certainty, it turns out, collides with some of the central themes of “Perfect Saviors.” Wolski noted how confusing the world has grown in an age of continuous connection; how information overload has made people stupid; and how social media’s need for us to constantly perform turns everyone into celebrities. “Our world is confounding and terrifying because of all of this, but it is still beautiful,” he said.
The result is the group’s most polished — and likely most accessible — record to date. “Sport of Form,” the album’s lead single, features heavy synths and harmonies interspersed with gentle acoustic guitars and a guest spot from Julien Baker, of boygenius fame. (Iggy Pop stops by to play the role of “God” in the music video.) There are even piano solos and ballads.
“They have this subversive plan to absolutely steamroll their way through conventions,” said Justin Meldal-Johnsen (Beck, Nine Inch Nails, M83), who played bass on a handful of the new tracks.
But Wolski and company still don’t want to fully escape their roots. Before setting out on tour supporting Queens of the Stone Age in early August, the Armed sent out a notice to its loyal devotees: The group was throwing one last renegade, unlicensed house show at a secret location in a Detroit suburb, free of charge.
More than 100 fans packed into a century-old, three-story mansion in Detroit’s Boston-Edison district 10 days later as the Armed played a blistering half-hour set inside a living room. The crowd was a mass of young, sweating bodies, moshing and crowd-surfing while trying to avoid kicking out the light fixtures on the ceiling.
Jezzy Maloney, a 24-year-old Detroit native, knew she had to attend the show after diving into the band’s catalog and embracing its buff makeover last year.
“Literally the day after I watched that video, I started going to the gym again,” she said of “All Futures.” At the house show, Maloney and five others got tattoos of the Armed’s logo — an angular play on an infinity symbol — in a parlor room adjacent to where the band was playing. They left at 5 a.m. the next day.
“There’s just nothing like them that I’ve ever encountered,” Maloney added. “It really has changed my life.”

JAKARTA, Indonesia — He is known as the Minister for Everything. From the government offices of Indonesia’s capital to dusty mines on remote islands, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan commands authority as the nation’s essential power broker.
A four-star general turned business magnate turned Cabinet officer, Luhut aspires to transform Indonesia into a hub for the production of electric vehicles. But as he pursues that paramount goal, he and his country are increasingly vulnerable to geopolitical forces beyond their control. Though this archipelago nation has long sidestepped entanglements in ideological rivalries, it is increasingly caught in the conflict between the United States and China.
At stake is control over nickel, a mineral used to make batteries for electric cars and motorcycles — a central component of the mission to limit the ravages of climate change.
Indonesia boasts the Earth’s largest reserves, making it something like the Saudi Arabia of nickel. But harvesting and refining those stocks is largely dependent on investment and technology from Chinese companies. And that has limited Indonesia’s access to the United States.
In Washington, the Biden administration has proffered tens of billions of dollars in tax credits to spur electric vehicle manufacturing. To qualify, cars sold in the United States must include an increasing share of parts and materials produced either in domestic factories or in countries deemed friendly to American interests.
In recent months, Luhut — formally, Indonesia’s coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment — has implored the Biden administration for a trade deal covering minerals in an effort to secure his country status as a friendly country. That would generate greater demand for its nickel by making it eligible for the American tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. Companies around the globe would presumably gain incentive to erect smelters and electric vehicle factories in Indonesia, enhancing the nation’s technological prowess, and creating jobs.
But Luhut, the government’s de facto lead official on trade matters, has been repeatedly rebuffed because of American concerns about Chinese investment in Indonesia’s nickel industry, as well as unease over working conditions and environmental standards. In Washington today, countering China’s technological ascendance is that rare objective that captures support on both sides of the political aisle.
Some within the Biden administration argue that this stance is shortsighted. Climate change is an existential threat. Nickel is a central component of the transition away from fossil fuels, making access to Indonesia’s stocks an objective of greatest urgency. But that logic has failed to win over powerful administration figures — especially on the National Security Council — who maintain that nothing should be subordinated to limiting China’s might.
All of which explained Luhut’s tone of weary indignation on a recent morning as he held court in his glass-fronted office at his residence in Jakarta, Indonesia’s teeming capital. Outside in his garden, magpies whistled emphatically in cages hung from orchid trees. Inside, the Minister for Everything lamented the pernicious misconceptions separating his nation from its destiny.
“America doesn’t understand what Indonesia is doing,” he said. “It’s frustrating.”
Money and Power
At 76, Luhut remains wiry, spry and prone to nationalist pique. He vehemently rejects the notion that Indonesia — a country of nearly 280 million people — must pick a side or imperil its business with the United States.
“This country is too big to lean toward any superpower,” he said.
The animosity between the United States and China was not the only issue causing him angst. He was incensed by the stance of the European Union, which has challenged a key tenet of Indonesia’s industrial designs: a ban on the export of nickel ore.
In refusing to sell its raw nickel to the world, Indonesia has drawn more than $14 billion in investment, primarily from Chinese companies, into smelters that process it into products used to make stainless steel and EV batteries. Since the ban was introduced in 2014, Indonesia’s exports of nickel products have multiplied more than tenfold, exceeding $30 billion last year, according to government data.
The European Union asserts that its companies are being deprived of a fair chance to import nickel ore. It brought and won a case at the World Trade Organization, gaining the power to apply punitive tariffs on Indonesia’s exports even as the country appeals.
Luhut likens that position to a perpetuation of the colonial era, when the Dutch, Portuguese and British hauled spices, sugar and other lucrative commodities back to European entrepôts. The nickel export ban is a corrective, he said, the means of securing the value of extraction for Indonesians.
“It’s the arrogance of European countries,” he said. “Maybe they thought that Indonesia is still colonized. We have the right now to improve the quality of life in this country.”
His righteous words coincide with the crude interplay of money and state power that has long animated Indonesian commerce.
Luhut earned his fortune in the business of coal, still the dominant way the country generates electricity. His company, TBS Energy, which trades on the Jakarta stock exchange, is now effectively controlled by his nephew, Pandu Sjahrir, who also heads Indonesia’s leading coal industry trade association. The company is intent on placing itself at the center of the “electrical vehicle ecosystem,” according its most recent annual report.
Nearly 62% of TBS Energy shares are owned by a Singapore-registered company, Highland Strategic Holdings, that is itself controlled by another holding company, which is in turn owned by a third entity, masking the real beneficiaries. Luhut does not appear in the paperwork maintained by Singapore regulators, but he still owns 8% of his old company, he said, positioning him to profit from new smelters.
Allies and rivals alike accuse Luhut of sharing in the proceeds of the Chinese-invested nickel ventures.
“It’s widely known among Jakarta business and political elites that Luhut, through his proxies, has engineered side deals for himself,” said a former Indonesian senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation from on high.
Luhut scoffed at such talk.
“If they give me $10 million cash, where do I put this money?” he said. “I’m not going to jeopardize my reputation because of $10 million.”
He flashed a raffish grin.
“If they give me $2 billion ,” he added, “maybe I’d consider it.”
A Critical Need
Luhut describes his plans for nickel as the centerpiece of his efforts to spread the benefits of economic development beyond Indonesia’s largest cities, where a thriving middle class throngs shopping malls, and on to impoverished communities.
Most of the nickel is on Sulawesi, a K-shaped, jungle-draped island that is roughly the size of Oklahoma. Despite its expanse, Sulawesi has long been an outlier in a nation of 17,000 islands whose political and economic spheres are dominated by the one that holds the bulk of the population: Java.
In communities near new smelters, many celebrate an infusion of new jobs, even as people denounce horrific pollution. Local workers complain that they are paid far less than those from China.
Early this year, roughly 3,000 workers staged a protest at a smelter in Central Sulawesi owned by PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry, a subsidiary of a Chinese company, Jiangsu Delong Group. The workers were enraged by a series of fatal accidents, and what they described as a dearth of protective gear and disparities in pay. As they set fire to vehicles, destroyed dorms and clashed with local security, two people died, including a Chinese national.
A special military force that answers to Luhut was dispatched to the site, unleashing tear gas to disperse the crowd.
“We have to guarantee security for investors,” said Constantinus Rusmanto, then the commander of the special force and now an aide to Luhut. “We make sure that everything here is good for investment.”
But some investors are alarmed by such tensions — especially companies from North America, Europe and Australia, where the reputational consequences of unsavory business can be enormous.
Luhut’s security apparatus is calibrated to the wants of businesses from China, where labor unions are banned and environmental and workplace standards can be readily skirted. In Washington, accounts of upheaval at Chinese-invested factories strengthen those opposed to extending Indonesia a trade deal.
Yet in Jakarta, the concept that Indonesia must apologize for its dealings with Chinese companies prompts derision. Government officials say they welcome investment from any place that brings capital and know-how. Chinese firms arrived early, recognizing the importance of nickel in the emerging realm of electric vehicles.
“The U.S. is missing in action,” said Arsjad Rasjad, chair of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce. “It’s not about us wanting to work with the Chinese. It’s that they are here.”
Experts accuse the United States of myopia in not embracing a trade deal with Indonesia, noting that Americans are already driving cars that use nickel mined there. The only question is which factories wind up making the batteries: those in China that now purchase nearly all of Indonesia’s nickel products, or new factories in the United States.
By 2035, more than 90% of all nickel products will be processed in countries that lack free-trade agreements with the United States, according to a recent study by S&P Global, a research firm. That makes it impossible for American battery factories to satisfy their demand for nickel without looking to countries beyond core U.S. trading partners.
“One way or another, Europe and the U.S. will need Indonesia nickel,” said Putra Adhiguna, an electric vehicle specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis in the Indonesian city of Bandung. “They should be coming to this country figuring out how they can do it better.”
The White House declined to discuss the particulars of its talks with Indonesian officials, while suggesting that deliberations continue.
“Indonesia is an important partner for fighting climate change and accelerating the clean energy transition,” said a spokesperson for the National Security Council, Eduardo Maia Silva. “We continue to consult with stakeholders and Congress on implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, and we remain interested in coordinating with Indonesia, just as we are with other partners, to strengthen the resilience of our critical minerals supply chains.”
Without a trade deal that can extend American tax credits to Indonesian minerals, many anticipate that the advent of electric vehicles will be hampered by a crude division: producers that rely on Chinese investment, and those that don’t.
Pandu, Luhut’s nephew, oversees a startup called Electrum, which is designing an electric motorcycle geared to maneuvering through Jakarta’s legendary traffic jams. The company is a joint venture between Luhut’s old company, TBS, and GoTo, a digital business that includes Gojek, a popular ride hailing platform.
Electrum is building a factory in West Java to assemble motorcycles using parts imported from China. But Pandu envisions eventually drawing on domestic factories.
The key, he said, is holding firm on the nickel export ban and attracting foreign investment.
“The market in Indonesia is big enough,” he said.
Alternate Plans
On a recent afternoon, Luhut sat at the head of a conference table at his ministry office, facing a half-dozen advisers. They tucked into lunches assembled at a buffet table — gado gado, a vegetable salad topped with peanut sauce; rendang, hunks of spicy stewed meat; fried rice.
The conversation centered on how to persuade Tesla, the electric car pioneer, to set up a factory in Indonesia. Luhut was about to visit the United States to beseech Tesla’s tempestuous CEO, Elon Musk.
His advisers fretted that Tesla would not come, given that most of the electricity in Indonesia is powered by coal. Still, they took hope from the fact that Ford Motor recently entered a joint venture to construct a nickel processing plant in Sulawesi. That plant is to be powered by a hydroelectric dam.
A wall outside Luhut’s office displayed a photo of himself in military regalia, receiving a medal at a special forces academy in North Carolina in the late 1970s. His father attended Cornell and Columbia before working as an engineer for an American oil company, Caltex. Luhut studied public policy at George Washington University, living happily in the U.S. capital, he said. His son lives in New York. His granddaughter is enrolled at Georgetown.
He feels comfortable in the United States, he said, describing a national affinity.
Still, in China, he is accorded extraordinary respect.
“They know how to deal with us,” he said. “They know how to treat us.”
Wang Yi — China’s top-ranking diplomat — handles his itinerary when he visits, arranging meetings with executives of companies eyeing investments in Indonesia, Luhut said. Even during the pandemic, when officials had to quarantine for 14 days after a face-to-face meeting with a foreigner, he could visit anyone he chose.
He and his advisers discussed a pending announcement: a drastic slashing of import duties on electric vehicles to give Tesla a taste of the Indonesian market.
But the next week, Tesla outlined plans to set up a Southeast Asian headquarters in Malaysia, Indonesia’s bitter rival, dealing Luhut a humiliation.
He was readying a backup plan, redoubling efforts to attract BYD, China’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer.
Luhut’s advisers quietly acknowledged that the American tax credits were not happening, not with the pushback in Congress after the Biden administration completed a minerals deals with Japan.
The Minister for Everything was absorbed with hawking nickel.
“We are aiming basically to the United States,” he said. “But if the Americans finally say, ‘We don’t want to take it,’ fine, we’ll look for some other places to go.”

Trump Already Eager To Debate With Biden: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The strong desire of Mr. Trump's advisers to see him debate Mr. Biden in the event of a rematch could lead to a clash with the Republican National Committee.
On July 17, the head of the Republican Party traveled to Donald J. Trump's private club and home in Bedminster, N.J., to make a personal pitch for him to join in the party's first sanctioned debate of the presidential nominating contest.
One of the arguments that the Republican National Committee chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, made to Mr. Trump that day was that by skipping the debate, he would give President Biden an excuse to get out of debating Mr. Trump should they meet again in 2024, according to two people familiar with their conversation.
Mr. Trump apparently disregarded the warning: He told people close to him in recent days that he had made up his mind not to participate in the first debate.Instead, he sat for a taped interview with Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host, which is expected to be posted online Wednesday. He suggested in a Sunday post on his social media site, Truth Social, that he would not face his primary rivals onstage at all, saying he has a wide lead and "I will therefore not be doing the debates!"
Still, Ms. McDaniel's argument appealed to a key focus of the Trump campaign as it looks ahead to a possible rematch with Mr. Biden: getting both men onstage. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said publicly that he wants debates with Mr. Biden, and Mr. Trump's advisers view face-offs with the incumbent president as vital to Mr. Trump's chances of winning.
It is unusually early to begin considering the contours of a general election debate, with months still to go until the Iowa caucuses and not a single vote cast in a primary race so far defined by Mr. Trump's four criminal indictments. But with both parties heading in the direction of renominating the same candidates as in 2020 -- Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump -- some thinking has already gone into potential matchups, at least on the Trump side.
The strong desire of Mr. Trump and his advisers to see him debate Mr. Biden may lead to Mr. Trump undercutting work by the R.N.C., which has spent the last two years searching for an alternative to the Commission on Presidential Debates for hosting general election matchups. Every presidential race since 1976 has had at least two televised debates, and the C.P.D., which is run by members of both parties, has overseen the process for every election since 1988.
The Republican Party sought to end that streak after 2020. But people with knowledge of the matter said that Mr. Trump is open to returning to a C.P.D. debate if that format is the only way he can ensure a debate against Mr. Biden.
One Republican strategist with knowledge of the Trump team's thinking, who was granted anonymity because they weren't authorized to disclose private conversations, put it bluntly: The party committee "will not control the party nominee's debate strategy in the general election."
But the party is trying to do just that. The "beat Biden pledge" that the R.N.C. is requiring candidates to sign to participate in primary debates also stipulates that they agree to participate only in R.N.C.-sanctioned general election debates. Mr. Trump has not yet signed it because he has not agreed to attend a primary debate.
The Republican strategist added that "the end goal is as many debates as possible between Donald Trump and Joe Biden," and that the Trump campaign would do whatever was necessary to achieve that goal.
A senior Biden official, who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said that there have been no senior-level staff meetings about debates yet, nor any discussions with the president himself.
But people in Mr. Biden's orbit had their own frustrations with the C.P.D. in 2020, in particular its handling of Covid protocols. The belated revelation that Mr. Trump had at least once tested positive for the virus just days before participating in the first debate only deepened their concern.
A Trump spokesman and an R.N.C. spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.
Since 2021, the R.N.C. has been pushing the C.P.D. for changes to how the debates are held. And, over the past year, it has actively looked for a non-C.P.D. debate host.
But the debates are negotiated between the nominees' campaigns and the commission, meaning the decision to participate is ultimately up to the nominee, and that the R.N.C. cannot force his or her hand.
In the past, candidates have skipped primary debates. And Mr. Biden, like other incumbents dating back to Gerald Ford, is declining primary debates. But there's little precedent in modern history for an incumbent president skipping general election debates, save for Jimmy Carter.
There have been no discussions between the C.P.D. and any of the campaigns as of yet, according to the commission.
"The C.P.D. starts discussions with the campaigns only after the nominating process has concluded," Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., the C.P.D. co-chairman and a former chairman of the R.N.C., said in a statement.
The group is expected to reveal the locations, dates and criteria for the general election debates in October. Typically, the C.P.D. hosts three sanctioned debates after both nominees have been selected at the party conventions.
Issues with the commission predate 2020, as its monopoly on general election debates has for years been a source of frustration for nominees from both parties. That is especially true for Republicans, who have complained bitterly since the 2012 presidential cycle about one of the moderators, Candy Crowley, then of CNN, fact-checking the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, in real time during a debate with the incumbent president, Barack Obama.
In 2020, Mr. Trump's team was enraged that the then-Fox News host Chris Wallace, whose coverage Mr. Trump often railed against, served as the moderator for the first C.P.D. debate. When the C.P.D. announced that the second debate would be virtual, the Trump team was apoplectic, and Mr. Trump announced he would not participate. Mr. Biden followed suit.
The decision to conduct the second debate virtually came after Mr. Trump appeared to be under the weather at the first debate on Sept. 29, 2020, then posted on Twitter less than 72 hours later that he had tested positive for Covid.
Since then, Mr. Trump's former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, has published a memoir about his tenure, in which he states that Mr. Trump had a positive Covid test three days before the debate, followed by a negative one. The assertion raised questions about when Mr. Trump's team knew he was sick and whether it was kept from the C.P.D. so that Mr. Trump did not have to cancel his appearance.
In addition, Mr. Biden's team was angered -- and complained to the C.P.D. afterward -- when several members of the Trump family, except for first lady Melania Trump, removed the masks they were required to wear to be in the audience as they sat in the front row for that first matchup.
The senior Biden official said that the Biden team felt a lot of people were put at risk at the time, and that it was likely that the president's campaign would press for its own specific rules. One possibility that could be raised would be conducting the debate without a live audience, given what happened recently when CNN hosted a New Hampshire primary town hall-style event with Mr. Trump. The former president fed on the laughter and applause from a cheering audience as he tried to dominate during his 70 minutes of prime time.
The official did not say whether Mr. Biden, an institutionalist who has typically been averse to breaking with tradition, would be inclined to skip a debate.
A spokesman for Mr. Biden declined to comment.
The sense that Mr. Trump could open himself up to the possibility of Mr. Biden choosing not to debate because Mr. Trump chose to skip at least one primary face-off has been underscored in recent days by Republicans with rival campaigns.
After The New York Times reported on Friday that Mr. Trump had told aides he would not join next week's event, Christina Pushaw, an aide to Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, highlighted a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, that Mr. Trump's adviser Jason Miller had written in August 2020 about Mr. Biden: "If Joe Biden is too scared to debate, he's too scared to run the country."
Mr. Trump and his advisers believe that debating his primary rivals at this point does little for him politically, given how far ahead he is in primary polls. However, national polls show that he would have a tight race against Mr. Biden, and aides think Mr. Trump can draw a favorable contrast to the president.
David Axelrod, who was a top adviser to former President Barack Obama during both of his presidential campaigns, said that the challenge for Mr. Biden's team is that even if the two camps agree on debate criteria, Mr. Trump refuses to follow rules.
"I think the fact that Trump is utterly irresponsible and turns every event into a circus and a platform for disseminating disinformation is the basis for saying: This isn't worthwhile," Mr. Axelrod said.
He explained that Mr. Trump's belief that the debates could bolster him may be misguided, pointing to the Sept. 29, 2020, debate, in which Mr. Trump was widely panned as having been too aggressive.
"He doesn't necessarily help himself, either," Mr. Axelrod said. "That first debate really hurt last time."
But Mr. Axelrod said that the notion that Mr. Biden could use Mr. Trump's avoidance of debates as a reason to avoid them himself was a "valid" question, noting that "whether you feel in a close race you could get away with that -- and whether the public would accept it -- is another question."

Online Retailers Are Taking Advantage of a Public Resource: City Streets: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Between 1961, when the social critic Jane Jacobs published "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," and the Covid lockdowns of 2020, it seemed the residential neighborhoods of Washington, like those of certain other, mostly Eastern cities in the United States, had discovered the secret of happiness and safety in the automobile age: narrow streets.
By law, two-way residential streets in Washington are supposed to be 34 feet from curb to curb, but many are a few feet narrower. The average car is about six feet wide, so parked cars on either side constrict a roadway quickly. Once you account for mirrors, swinging doors and the occasional mis-parked minivan or S.U.V., the two lanes of moving traffic might have only 13 or 14 feet of road space to work with. Drivers can move freely but cautiously, braking to pass. For Jacobs and other urban theorists, that's perfect -- these are not neighborhoods that shortcut-seeking motorists consider worthwhile to barrel through, or where playing children need to fear sudden surprises.
This delicate balance of functionality and inconvenience has been upset. In recent years, and especially since the onset of the pandemic, something has changed on city streets -- not the streets themselves but the implicit social agreement that determines how they are used.
The internet is largely to blame. Waze and other navigation apps have channeled impatient motorists into unpromising-looking byways. But even more consequential has been the quantum leap in e-commerce, which has brought hundreds of thousands of vans onto the streets. They're big. FedEx's Freightliner MT45s and Amazon's Ford Transits, Mercedes-Benz Sprinters and Ram ProMasters are all about eight feet wide. Streets that were tight but passable have often wound up blocked off.
This is more than a quality-of-life issue. As with disputes over bicycling rights and privileged parking access for users of certain alternative fuels, it raises a political question about the use of our roadways. We find ourselves in a de facto negotiation over how Amazon and other delivery networks will compensate the country for their partial takeover of the publicly funded road system that makes up a large part of their work space. Concessions can and should be extracted from Amazon. But the public's leverage is weak, the political dynamics are complex and the alternatives are fewer than they used to be.
One can lament the shortsightedness that brought this state of affairs about. The 1992 Supreme Court decision Quill Corporation v. North Dakota, since overturned, absolved companies from collecting sales tax in states where they did not have a physical "nexus." The Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998, which blocked new taxes on internet access, also contained language banning "multiple" and "discriminatory" taxes on e-commerce, further tying states' hands. The upshot was an enduring advantage for internet retailers over bricks-and-mortar stores.
That outcome, though deplorable, is not easy to undo. With half a trillion dollars in annual sales and billions in profits most quarters, Amazon is among the largest employers in many states, and the very largest employer in the richest state: New Jersey. Internet commerce has hollowed out the storefronts of old commercial zones and rendered them useless for anything but face-to-face services such as pouring espresso and painting nails. Those bricks-and-mortar businesses that Amazon and others eliminated were not just market competitors at an individual level -- collectively, they provided an alternative retail infrastructure that might have allowed regulators to drive a harder bargain with Amazon.
Adding insult to injury, the big internet retailers have taken great advantage of a communal resource. The real estate that Amazon and other vendors require to make their deliveries is not private but public. We faced a smaller version of this problem with the surge of urban lunch trucks a decade ago. In many cities restaurant owners complained that the trucks were being allowed to undercut them by commandeering public property, while carrying a far lighter burden in rent, regulations and taxes.
The problem with big deliverers is not only larger, it's also more acute, for they can often use public property at a discount. Since the turn of the century, New York City has reportedly given about $ 750 million in parking ticket discounts to UPS, FedEx and other companies that run up huge double-parking bills. Philadelphia has long shown leniency to double parkers, too (although that is reportedly changing).
In theory, the solution to the problem is simple: charge more for double parking and police the abuse more effectively, perhaps with the help of high-tech apps and road sensors that closely track the movement and location of delivery trucks. That is not so different from the way E-ZPass assesses tolls for the use of highways, bridges and tunnels.
However it works, policing e-commerce on the road will require trade-offs. Consider an example from Philadelphia. Many residents have complained about trucks parked along a new waterfront trail in the city as they load in front of a Dave & Buster's. In an interview on the website of the public radio station WHYY, the city's deputy streets department commissioner, Richard Montanez, pleaded for understanding. He noted that the outlet had brought a new purpose to what had been an abandoned warehouse. "Dave & Buster's was there prior to the city building this trail, and now trail users want the Dave & Buster's gone," he told WHYY. "We understand what the community wants, but the community also wants jobs. It's a very delicate balance."
Fair-mindedness in cases like these means paying heed to gentrifying lifestyle nags and speculative developers -- but without reflexively favoring them over established residents and entrenched interests. The politics of repurposing roads looks like the politics of anything else over the last decade or so: a tense battle between a bunch of elite planners doubting the public's wisdom and a seething public doubting the elite's legitimacy.
Bikes are another example. Based on fleeting declines in car traffic during the Covid lockdowns, many zealous city councils made a big bet on bike lanes. To put it less delicately, they cynically transferred the benefit of lots of public property from car commuters and small retail businesses to bike-riding elites and corporate e-businesses. American drivers are bound to take any new road regime poorly. If recent history is anything to go by, they will understand it as a class-based politics aimed against those who can't afford real estate within biking distance of the city center.
"Why don't we ask the 'no cars!' people how they get their groceries and general supplies?" asked one correspondent in the Inside-Booster, a Chicago community newspaper. "I would venture to guess they are Amazon Prime members, and we can thank their delivery trucks for clogging up our community by double parking while making their deliveries."
We can expect more of this.

The Clean Energy Future Is Roiling Both Friends and Foes

If there is anywhere in the country primed to welcome the clean energy transition, it is Penobscot Bay in Maine. Electricity prices there are high and volatile. The ocean waters are warming fast, threatening the lobster fishery. Miles offshore, winds blow strong enough to heat every home and power every car in the state.
For more than 15 years, researchers at the University of Maine have been honing scale models of floating wind turbines inspired by oil rigs. They are now confident they can mass-produce turbine blades the length of football fields and float them miles into the ocean. It is the kind of breakthrough in clean energy technology that is allowing a much faster transition to renewables than many believed possible, aided by state officials eager to pioneer a floating wind industry.
One key to harnessing that wind lies at the end of a causeway jutting into the bay, on a mostly undeveloped island where eagles fish offshore and people walk in the quiet shade. Many officials see this spot, known as Sears Island, as the ideal site to build and launch a flotilla of turbines that could significantly lessen Maine’s reliance on fossil fuels.
Standing in their way are environmental groups and local residents, all of whom are committed to a clean energy future and worried about the rapid warming of the Earth. Still, they want the state to pick a different site for its so-called wind port, citing the tranquility of Sears Island and its popularity and accessibility as a recreation destination.
On a recent summer morning one conservationist against the plan, Scott Dickerson, sat on a picnic bench and predicted environmental groups would sue to thwart development of the island, as they had many times in the past.
“And that, as you can imagine, is going to run the clock,” he said, costing the state valuable time that could be saved by looking elsewhere.
After years of fits and starts, the transition to renewable energy like wind and solar power is finally shifting into full gear in many parts of the world, including the United States, which has been buoyed by massive new subsidies from the Biden administration. But around the country, the effort is being slowed by a host of logistical, political and economic challenges.
Breaks in supply chains have stalled big projects. Historically low unemployment makes it hard to hire workers to build or install new turbines or solar panels. Shortcomings in the power grid can block newly generated electricity from reaching customers. Federal, state and local regulations, including often byzantine permitting requirements, threaten to delay some construction for years. So do the court battles that almost inevitably follow those permitting decisions.
These problems are not unique to the United States. In Europe, orders for new turbines dropped unexpectedly last year as developers struggled with inflation and sluggish permitting. In parts of China, a growing fraction of electricity from turbines and solar panels is being wasted because the grid lacks capacity. In Australia, clean energy companies have complained about a shortage of skilled workers.
At the same time, it tends to take longer to build solar arrays, wind farms, car chargers and transmission lines in the United States than in China, India and Europe, a recent analysis by the International Energy Agency found.
But no hurdle to a clean energy transition at the speed and scale scientists say is needed to avert catastrophic warming is easier to see than the growing local backlash to large-scale wind and solar projects, like the one roiling Sears Island.
The problem boils down to this: If lawmakers want to ramp up renewables as fast and cheaply as possible, they’ll need to bulldoze or build over some places that people treasure.
While Americans broadly support renewable energy, polls show, they are less enthusiastic about having it in their backyard. One survey from 2021 found that only 24% of Americans were willing to live within 1 mile of a solar farm; the number dropped to 17% for wind farms.
Such resistance is often rooted in anxieties about broader social and economic change in communities where families have lived for generations. But in some cases, like lawsuits trying to stop wind farm development off Massachusetts, groups with funding from fossil fuel interests have stoked fear. Those efforts are their own sort of obstacle to renewables: an attempt by incumbent energy players to protect their market share, even if the economics have turned against them.
A recent analysis found that it would cost less for electric utilities to build new wind and solar farms than to operate most of the existing coal-fired power plants — a stunning shift from 15 years ago, when burning coal was the cheapest way to make electricity.
But after years of rapid growth, installations of wind, solar and batteries slowed by 15% last year, according to the American Clean Power Association, a trade group.
“There’s a lot of capital ready to flow,” said Gregory Wetstone, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, another trade group. “But to get these projects going, you need to get them permitted, you need to get them connected to the grid, you need workers, you need access to supply chains. All of that can still be quite difficult.”
In Maine, many of those challenges are concentrated at one choke point: where to put a new wind port, which state officials have not decided on.
Offshore turbines need a large slab of land where they can be built and launched to sea. That site must connect to highways, to truck in materials, but also sit beside deep water.
The state’s two main contenders are in Searsport, about 30 miles south of Bangor.
One site is an industrial area, Mack Point, clearly visible from Sears Island. It is the spot many locals and conservationists prefer. The company that owns it says it could be easily converted to build and ship offshore turbines.
But some officials have warned that it could be difficult for Mack Point to secure needed permits from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies in order to dredge the bay and build new port facilities.
In Searsport, many residents fear that state officials will bypass Mack Point, which sits on private land and would need to be leased for millions of dollars a year — costs that would probably be passed on to utility customers.
Sears Island, in contrast, is owned by the state. Under a previous agreement with conservation groups, two-thirds of its woods and beaches are to be a nature preserve. The other third is zoned for a port.
Supporters of choosing the island site include Habib Dagher, a godfather of Maine’s offshore wind efforts and the founding executive director of the University of Maine’s Advanced Structures and Composites Center. He suggested it was worth trading the existing open space of the island for lower energy prices and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
“All of us would like to think that we can have renewable energy with zero impact on the environment — as you know, it’s not possible, right?” Dagher said in an interview at his wind lab. “So our goal, and our challenge, is: How do we minimize impact on environment as we embark on this transformational energy system?”
Conservation groups have fought development on Sears Island for decades, beating back a nuclear power plant, a gas import terminal and more. They reject the idea that they must lose that fight now — even as they lament climate change.
Rolf Olsen is a retired marketing executive and an avid day hiker. He kayaks and likes to swim in Penobscot Bay after mowing his lawn. He drives a white plug-in Toyota Prius and is vice president of a group called Friends of Sears Island, and he sat on a state advisory panel over where to locate the wind port, which he says should be at Mack Point.
On a recent hike, he described what a Sears Island port might look like, in place of the oaks and the birches.
“I have a picture in my mind’s eye. You know, it’s huge, flat, towering concrete and steel,” he said. “It saddens me.”
So, he added, does the warming of the planet.
“I have a granddaughter who’s 3. She’s going to have to live in a different world.”

Hard Work Washed Away With a Single Winter Storm: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Just a few years ago, the beach at Fire Island Pines was almost as wide as a football field, the result of a $ 1.7-billion government project to combat erosion on the South Shore of Long Island after Hurricane Sandy.
The project seemed to provide a new lease on life to one of New York's untrammeled gems: a nearly car-free string of beach towns on a 32-mile barrier island that feels like a world apart from the city, and that for decades has provided a wooded haven to both endangered wildlife and members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community.
But today, parts of that same beach are barely as wide as a volleyball net.
Most of that damage was done in the wake of a single winter storm last December that triggered rapid erosion on Fire Island and appeared to undo large parts of that decade-long restoration project in a matter of months.
As the beach succumbs to the advancing ocean, at stake are not just waterfront real estate and legendary beach parties. Fire Island is a crucial part of a string of barrier islands protecting Long Island, one of the most densely populated coastal regions in the United States, from climate change and the extreme weather of the Atlantic hurricane season.
But efforts to protect Fire Island -- and the legacy of the government anti-erosion project -- appear hamstrung by rules that make the United States Army Corps of Engineers responsible for maintenance and emergency repairs on any beach they have built, a stark change from the more flexible approach that local leaders said was possible before Sandy.
"This is, I think, the worst the beach has ever been in my 25 years on Fire Island," said Henry Robin, the president of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners' Association.
"That beach needs to be repaired for reasons that are much greater than my beautiful little summer house," added Mr. Robin, a retiree who acts as the beach town's de facto mayor. "This barrier island is the first line of defense for the mainland."
One Bad Storm
Accessible primarily by ferry from Long Island, Fire Island is home to tiny beach towns that transform into bustling summer colonies, two of which -- Fire Island Pines and Cherry Grove -- are world-famous L.G.B.T.Q. resorts.
Last December, when the island was virtually empty, a major winter storm wreaked havoc across the United States, whipping up rough seas off Long Island. When the tide went back out, Mr. Robin said, much of the beach went with it.
A spokeswoman for Suffolk County said the South Shore suffered $ 15.2 million-worth of damage, including the destruction of beach infrastructure -- stairs, boardwalks, ramps -- that local municipalities repaired. A significant amount of sand was also lost, and the responsibility for replacing it falls on the Army Corps, the spokeswoman said.
After the storm, the county successfully petitioned the Army Corps for emergency repair of the beaches on Fire Island's western end. A spokesman for the Army Corps, Michael Embrich, said in an email that the cost of "future beach renourishment work" would be divided evenly between "federal and nonfederal funding."
Repairs on the island's western beaches are scheduled to begin in the fall, Mr. Robin said. But the Army Corps denied a request to expand the scope of the project to include the island's eastern side, including Fire Island Pines and Cherry Grove.
"What's really so incredibly concerning about it is that in previous years, before the Army Corps brought us this beach, we would be fixing it ourselves right now," said Mr. Robin. "But now we're at the mercy of the Army Corps."
Mr. Robin said local leaders were not given a clear reason their appeal for emergency assistance on the eastern side of Fire Island was denied.
Mr. Embrich, the Army Corps spokesman, declined to explain the agency's reasoning to repair only one section of the island. He said in a statement that engineers "determined that the storms did not meet the federal criteria of extraordinary storms for emergency funding.
"Therefore, according to federal law, Congress must appropriate any additional funds that fall outside the project funding," Mr. Embrich added. "We will continue to work with our partners at the State of New York to find ways to mitigate storm risk for the residents of Long Island."
A walk along the beaches of Fire Island, or a quick glance at before-and-after photos that were shared widely online, makes the scale of the problem plain to see.
At low tide, parts of the beach are carved into steep slopes that connect a narrow band of dry sand with the crashing surf. But it is at high tide that Fire Island's problems become most apparent.
When the tide comes in, beaches that were broad just a few years ago are reduced to spindly, narrow paths. In some places, the water reaches almost to the base of the island's grassy dunes, and seaweed clumps beneath the steps of the walkways that lead from town to the beach.
Climate change has also raised Fire Island's water table, Mr. Robin said. That means that as seawater eats away at its edges, the island's narrow interior takes on more water as well, filling up like a sponge and causing a range of problems.
Parts of Fire Island Pines, including the upscale shops of its tiny business district, have become plagued by a sewage smell on rainy days, as septic tanks do battle with rising groundwater.
And even on sunny days, parts of the town's main access road, Fire Island Boulevard, flood at high tide, forcing maintenance trucks and emergency vehicles to ford a narrow swamp that was once a road.
"The beach comes and goes."
Rumaan Alam, a novelist who has spent part of each summer on Fire Island for almost 20 years, said he was shocked to see the state of the beaches when he returned this year.
He said it was "jarring to see what seems like the failure of this big project" as he walked down the beach with his husband and two children from their home in Cherry Grove.
"It is so scary, especially in a season where the Canadian wildfires are obscuring the sky and you're reading about record heat in the West," said Mr. Alam. The steep pitch of the sand at low tide can make it treacherous for children and older adults to walk. It has also left beachgoers with few places to sit aside from the dunes, which are fenced off to prevent people from damaging them and further accelerating the pace of erosion.
On the Fourth of July, Mr. Alam saw "a big group of high school girls with their faces painted to say 'U.S.A.' just laying out on the dunes," he said. "There was nowhere else for them to be."
The erosion also threatened one of the summer's biggest events: a high-profile fund-raiser called Pines Party that draws hundreds of people to the beach and has raised millions of dollars for L.G.B.T.Q. causes since 1999.
For the first time this year, there was no stretch of beach in Fire Island Pines wide enough to accommodate the all-night event.
Administrators at the Fire Island National Seashore allowed organizers to hold the party on another beach just outside of town, but one day of heavy rain rendered that site unusable, too.
Organizers were forced to relocate the event on one week's notice, and they only found a new site because a colony of endangered piping plovers migrated away, vacating a new stretch of the national seashore.
Allan Baum, the event's producer, said the ordeal convinced him to move the party from July to August going forward.
"We won't have to worry about the birds as much, but we do have to worry about the beach," said Mr. Baum. "The beach comes and goes."
An Army Corps Beach
Protecting Long Island from erosion has been on the minds of federal, state and local officials for decades. But efforts to coordinate a response happened in fits and starts, and they were completely suspended for more than a decade in the 1980s and 1990s.
Before Sandy, property owners on Fire Island paid for their own anti-erosion efforts using local tax money every few years, said Mr. Robin.
But that system was no match for Hurricane Sandy, which caused tens of billions of dollars of damage in the New York metro area and killed at least 72 people in the United States, including 65 in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut area.
After Sandy, the federal government began the $ 1.7-billion Fire Island Inlet to Montauk Point project to protect 83 miles of Long Island's South Shore, which makes up roughly 70 percent of Long Island's shoreline. The project was fully paid for by the federal government, said a spokesman for the Army Corps.
The project's work on Fire Island included the placement of 2.3 million cubic yards of sand. When it was completed, the island was left with broad beaches, a protective shield of high dunes, and the hope that maybe the problem had been solved.
"The water used to come all the way up to the yards of the houses right on the ocean, and that doesn't happen now," said Isaac Namdar, who has vacationed on Fire Island for two decades. "But who knows how long that will last."
But because the Army Corps is now in charge of the beach, local residents can no longer just organize repairs themselves. Instead, they must work with the federal government, Mr. Robin said.
There are at least three bureaucratic avenues they can pursue, but the Army Corps has already turned down what may have been the quickest and easiest one, he said. Each of the remaining options involves a complex stand-alone project that could take months or years.
Meanwhile, the sea draws ever closer.
"Because of the damage to the beach, we may now be in the most vulnerable state we have ever been in," said Mr. Robin, looking out over the waves on a recent day. "There's no beach out there."

The Band's Farewell Lives On: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The film capturing the Band's final performance in 1976 is a showcase for the group's main songwriter and guitarist, Robbie Robertson. And for some, that was a problem.
By the mid-1970s, the Band was well known as the group that had backed Bob Dylan on his first electric tour and released a series of its own reverentially reviewed albums that returned music to a pre-psychedelic era and augured a return-to-basics movement in rock. But in 1976, with the quality and sales of its albums both declining, the Band announced a farewell show, full of illustrious guest stars, at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco on Thanksgiving Day. The gala concert would be filmed by Martin Scorsese, who in the last few years had directed the provocative and acclaimed films "Mean Streets," "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" and "Taxi Driver."
The music documentaries of the late '60s and early '70s -- "Don't Look Back," starring a scabrous Dylan, in 1967, then the concert films "Monterey Pop" in 1968 and "Woodstock" in 1970, as well as the Rolling Stones debacle "Gimme Shelter" the same year -- were low-budget affairs, underground in their lighting, camerawork and sound. D.A. Pennebaker shot "Don't Look Back" by himself, using a hand-held camera and 16-millimeter film.
"The Last Waltz" -- which put a spotlight on the Band's guitarist and principal songwriter, Robbie Robertson, who died this week at 80 -- was a confident, dramatic upgrade with an atypical structure. It begins with the concert's final song, and incorporates band interviews and B-roll shots to give personality to each member. The 1978 film employs highly stylized backlighting and footlights, avoids audience shots and uses nearly every camera angle except low angle front, which is how bands are traditionally seen by members of an audience. The musicians dressed like western gunslingers ready to face their end, and to counteract all the mythic imagery, the interviews are full of the kind of artifice other films edit out, including awkward exchanges between the band members and Scorsese, their stumbling inquisitor. The movie dwells in shades of purple, the color of bruises and cabernet sauvignon.
It didn't take long for critics to laud "The Last Waltz." In the British music weekly Record Mirror, Mike Gardner called it "the first rock movie to eschew the shambling amateurism that passes for rock cinema and replace it with the most illustrious professionals within Hollywood." More resoundingly, Pauline Kael of The New Yorker (no big fan of cinéma vérité) wrote that it was "the most beautiful rock movie ever."
These days, "The Last Waltz" is by consensus one of the best music films in the canon, neck and neck with "Stop Making Sense," the Talking Heads concert film by Jonathan Demme. Many deconstructions of the Scorsese film describe it as a crucial and irreversible departure in rock filmmaking, a move away from naïve image-capturing and the "shaky camera" of Jonas Mekas, and toward canny image-making.
The star power in front of the camera -- guests included Dylan, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Ringo Starr and Muddy Waters -- was matched by the filmmaking expertise behind it. The crew included the director of photography Michael Chapman, plus seven camera operators, including the renowned Vilmos Zsigmond and Laszlo Kovacs, all shooting with 35-millimeter film, as well as the recording engineer and Neil Young collaborator Elliot Mazer. The production designer Boris Leven dressed the Winterland stage with columns, chandeliers and wall hangings from the San Francisco Opera's staging of "La Traviata," bringing some 19th-century Italian brio to the farewell concert.
How did it all come together? Once the Band decided to disband, Robertson wanted to find "someone special to capture this event on film," he wrote in "Testimony," his 2016 memoir. He considered most of the emerging young directors of the mid-70s -- Hal Ashby, George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola and Milos Forman -- but picked Scorsese, who had been an assistant director and editor on "Woodstock" and was already considered gifted at using music cues onscreen, most notably Jackson Browne's "Late for the Sky" in "Taxi Driver," and "Jumpin' Jack Flash," by the Rolling Stones, in "Mean Streets."
Robertson, the most sophisticated, charming and socially fluent member of the Band, met Scorsese through Jon Taplin, a Princeton graduate who had been a road manager for the Band, and later produced "Mean Streets." Once Scorsese signed on, he asked for lyrics to each song in the concert, so he could plan camera movements and lighting changes. He eventually wrote a 200-page shooting script, according to Robertson. Other sources say it was 300 pages.
The director and the guitarist grew close, especially during postproduction, and pretty soon they were living together and jetting off to parties in Paris or Rome. That closeness caused friction: Despite the acclaim for "The Last Waltz," some members of the Band felt that Robertson had made the film about him, rather than about them.
The drummer Levon Helm, whose superlatively soulful voice electrifies "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down" and "Up on Cripple Creek," made these criticisms public with the 1993 publication of his memoir "This Wheel's on Fire." He called the movie "a disaster" and accused Scorsese of making Robertson look great while ignoring other band members.
By then, Robertson and Helm had arrived at very different levels of success and financial comfort. "Robbie won. Levon lost," Ken Gordon wrote in a 2015 essay in The Bitter Southerner. Some people reflexively side with winners, others with losers, and after Helm's book came out, Robertson's reputation suffered in some circles, and possibly influenced subsequent evaluations of "The Last Waltz," especially after it was rereleased in theaters and on DVD in 2002.
"The movie's real subject is not the Band as a whole, but Robbie Robertson," Stephen E. Severn wrote in Film Quarterly, adding that "virtually every visual and thematic aspect of 'The Last Waltz' is designed to showcase his talents at the expense of the other members of the group." Nonetheless, Severn affirms that it "may be the best film ever made about the music scene," one that, unwittingly or not, reveals the cutthroat nature of the business.
Nearly 25 years after the release of "The Last Waltz," its placement on lists of the best music documentaries was so common that the consensus around the film was ripe for a challenge. "'The Last Waltz' has inexplicably been called the greatest rock documentary of all time," Roger Ebert wrote in 2002. In a re-evaluation of the movie that same year, Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times that "part of the pleasure is in watching Robbie Robertson, the group's leader, seduce Mr. Scorsese."
The movie is more skeptically understood now, but its stature has never waned. Even its stoutest opponents recognize its quality. "Critics called the movie the best and most sumptuous film ever made about a rock concert," Levon Helm wrote grumpily in his book, "and I suppose that's true."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two YouTube hosts have built a following by dissecting the psychology of movie characters. Here, they analyze some of this summer's familiar faces.
Is Indiana Jones better at burying his feelings than digging up priceless artifacts? How might Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver's characters in "Marriage Story" have better navigated divorce and co-parenting? Hey, wait a minute: Does the hero of "The Lego Batman Movie" contain all the building blocks of a narcissist?
Such questions are the bread and butter -- or perhaps the popcorn and butter-flavored topping -- of the YouTube series "Cinema Therapy." Founded in 2020 by its hosts, Jonathan Decker, a marriage and family therapist, and Alan Seawright, a filmmaker, the channel has built a following in part by holding faux therapy sessions for heroes, villains and onscreen couples, treating movie plots and characters as case studies for mental health topics. Some typical titles: "Psychology of a Hero: 'Hulk' and Anger Management," "Villain Therapy: Jobu Tupaki From 'Everything Everywhere All at Once"' and "Movie Couple Therapy: 'Shrek."'
Like TikTok therapists and mindfulness podcasts, "Cinema Therapy" is part of a wave of modern media that delves into topics once reserved for psychology books, academic journals and, well, actual therapy. The hosts and their team shoot the videos in the basement of Seawright's Utah home. By YouTube's count, many episodes have been viewed more than a million times each.
In a recent interview, Decker and Seawright, both 42, discussed characters from four of this summer's big movies.
Barbie
Greta Gerwig's take on the toy line centers on a version of Barbie (Margot Robbie) whose ostensibly perfect life is interrupted when she develops flat feet and irrepressible thoughts of death.
DECKER Barbie is having an existential crisis. We see this in real life -- the whole, "things start to go wrong in my life and I'm not sure why, because I'm just chugging along like I always have been." And the assumption is, what I've always been doing is fine. There's a phrase in trauma healing, "the thing that used to help you has now got you stuck." What saved me before is now hurting me.
SEAWRIGHT There's a difference in life, and in film characters, between what the character wants and what they need.
DECKER Barbie wants everything to just keep going the way it's going. What she needs is self-reflection, introspection and perspective-taking. Perspective-taking allows her to make a shift, to let go of the thing that worked for her in the past and to walk into a future that's going to work for her. What I would prescribe is exactly what the movie does.
J. Robert Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer," Christopher Nolan's biopic about the man who was central to the development of the atomic bomb, shows its subject (played by Cillian Murphy) grappling with the consequences of his invention -- and maintaining a romantic connection with a political activist, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), while married to Katherine Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt), known as Kitty.
SEAWRIGHT It was really fascinating to see [Nolan] apply his complex, nonlinear time sense to a guy who, in a very similar way, looked at the rules of physics and was like, "No, I'm going to break those" -- and who looked at the rules of relationships and went, "No, I'm going to break those."
DECKER Oppenheimer to me, it's like the difference between narcissism and hubris. Because Oppenheimer isn't devoid of compassion for other people. Generally, he doesn't put others down to make himself look better. He does think that he is unique and specially gifted, but, to be fair, he was. So Oppenheimer is not a narcissist, but he does have a high amount of hubris. It's the hubris that led to the naïveté -- the naïveté in his personal relationships that, "I can carry on with Jean while being married to Kitty and this'll go fine." What I would prescribe in therapy is cognitive behavioral treatment exploring his assumptions about himself and the world around him, to challenge that thinking.
Miles and Rio Morales
One story line in "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse," the latest adventure of the teenage hero Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore), finds Miles furthering a relationship with Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld). Miles's mother, Rio Morales (Lauren Vélez), struggles to accept it -- though she does come around.
DECKER In adulthood, presumably, we have full autonomy. In childhood, we're very reliant on our parents. And then in between is where the power struggle happens, where kids want more power than the parents feel they're ready for, and parents want more control than the kids want to give them. Alan and I both feel the same way: There have been so many unhealthy relationships played for drama, that to actually show people growing and doing right by each other is not only refreshing -- I think it's the future of storytelling. Some of our more popular episodes have been about healthy movie marriages or things where we show what good parenting looks like. People are like, "I have plenty of examples in my real life of what the negative looks like." And so I like to see Miles's mom arrive where she did.
Indiana Jones
Harrison Ford's whip-snapping archaeologist is in low spirits at the start of "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny," which finds an aging Indy separated from his wife, Marion (Karen Allen), and grieving the death of their son.
SEAWRIGHT This is a married couple who lost a son. They need to be in therapy. Granted, it's, what, the late '60s, early '70s? That's not really a thing that's done.
DECKER I don't know if I would give him major depressive disorder, maybe dysthymic disorder, which is like depressive disorder but it doesn't have as many rigorous criteria. Instead of chronic, it would be circumstantial: circumstantial related to aging, the loss of his son, his separation from his wife. The way he has a lack of not just energy, but a lack of interest in life, in people. The things that used to excite him don't excite him anymore. What I would urge him to do in counseling is to not do what he generally does, which is to bury his feelings. I would advise him to go to therapy with Marion and to work on expressing his vulnerability and opening up to her.

On Campaign Trail, Difficulty Avoiding Talk of Trump's Latest Charges: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Voters pressed them to weigh in. Reporters asked about pardons. Mike Pence was heckled. Republicans found it's not easy to escape the fallout from Donald J. Trump's legal peril.
Days after the front-runner was indicted on charges of trying to subvert an election, Republican candidates in their presidential primary returned to the campaign trail acting as if nothing had changed.
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida scooped ice cream in Iowa as he pitched his economic plans. Senator Tim Scott went to the southern border with a promise to be tough on immigration. Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor, showed up in Ukraine, a dramatic attempt to focus on foreign policy. And former Vice President Mike Pence talked up the "Trump-Pence administration" to crowds in New Hampshire.
But their dogged attempts to create a political safe space -- an indictment-free zone, where they are not asked to defend or attack former President Donald J. Trump, the dominant leader in the race and the party's most powerful figure -- kept failing.
Reporters asked questions about stolen-election lies and potential presidential pardons. Voters wanted to know what they thought of the new charges. Trump supporters greeted Mr. Pence with a sign calling him a "traitor." Mr. Trump, too, had thoughts.
"Those indictments are not worth the paper they're written on," Mr. Trump said at a Republican Party dinner in Columbia, S.C. on Saturday night, as he continued to claim falsely that the 2020 election was "rigged." "They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you."
The scenes demonstrated the nearly impossible challenge before the Republican field as the candidates soldier on in a primary like no other. As Mr. Trump rallies Republicans to his side against what he says is a political persecution, how can they move beyond a past election to talk about the future?
For months, their strategy has been simple: Ignore, deflect and change the subject. But it's an approach that became significantly harder this week, as the felony counts against Mr. Trump grew to number 78 across three criminal cases with the addition of a federal indictment in a Washington, D.C., federal court accusing him of conspiring to defraud the government and to obstruct an official proceeding, as well as other crimes.
On a three-day bus tour through Iowa, Mr. DeSantis hammered on his usual themes: his record as Florida governor, and his plans on immigration and economic policy. But he could not entirely escape the drumbeat of news from Washington.
At a brewery in northeast Iowa on Friday, a member of the audience asked whether he thought Mr. Trump's latest indictment was a "witch hunt." Mr. DeSantis responded that the case was "politically motivated, absolutely."
Later, a reporter asked whether he would pardon Mr. Trump, should the former president be convicted in the election case. Mr. DeSantis suggested he would -- before quickly trying to recast the race as about the future.
"I don't think it's in the best interest of the country to have a former president that's almost 80 years old go to prison," the governor, 44, told reporters at a tire shop in Waverly, Iowa. "And just like Ford pardoned Nixon, sometimes you've got to put this stuff behind you, and we need to start focusing on things having to do with the country's future."
He added: "This election needs to be about Jan. 20, 2025, not Jan. 6, 2021."
Still, there were some signs that the newest charges against Mr. Trump had pushed Mr. DeSantis, whose campaign is under pressure to appeal to more moderate voters, to inch toward criticism of the former president. He acknowledged -- to a reporter -- that claims that the 2020 election was stolen "did not prove to be true" -- a more direct response than he typically gives when asked about Mr. Trump's defeat.
On Saturday, after a stop at a restaurant in Vinton, he criticized Mr. Trump for not committing to attend the first Republican debate later this month.
"You've got to earn this nomination," Mr. DeSantis said. "I think anybody that says somehow that they are above the process, that's not going to land well in Iowa. That's not going to land well in New Hampshire."
Part of the challenge for Mr. Trump's opponents is that even Republicans who want to move past the former president defend him. Sandy Lloyd, a 61-year-old fourth-grade teacher, said she did not plan to vote for Mr. Trump, having grown tired of the frequent controversies surrounding him. Yet she said that she thought the election had been stolen and that she didn't want to see Mr. DeSantis attack Mr. Trump.
"If I'm going for a new job, I don't go into my interview and attack everybody else -- I tell them why they want me," Ms. Lloyd said. "That's what I want to hear. Why do I want you as president?"
Other voters, arguing that the criminal charges make Mr. Trump a weak general election candidate, wanted to see his rival be more aggressive.
"I would love for him to go harder against Trump," said James Smith, a supporter of Mr. DeSantis who drove from Wisconsin to see the governor. "You're not going to win the Republican nomination by not going after the leader. The only way to shake up the race is by attacking."
But no candidate has a harder time escaping the political realities of the Trump indictments than Mr. Pence, who told prosecutors that Mr. Trump had pressured him to reject electoral votes in an attempt to disrupt the transfer of power.
About a dozen Trump supporters gathered outside the American Legion post where Mr. Pence spoke Friday evening. They heckled him as he entered.
"What Pence did is, he committed treason -- that's the bottom line," said Derek Arnold, a protester from Derry, N.H. "He had the choice to do the right thing. And that man knows right from wrong, and we're here to let him know that he did us wrong."
When Mr. Pence told a standing crowd of around 100 people that he had "stood loyally by President Trump," his comment prompted scoffing from some in the room. But he was applauded after he finished his thought: "And I never changed my commitment to him until the day came that my oath to the Constitution required me to do otherwise."
Asked if he would pardon Mr. Trump, Mr. Pence was noncommittal.
"I really don't understand why some candidates in the Republican primary are assuming that the president is going to be found guilty in these various cases," Mr. Pence said. "Let him make his case in court, and if I have the privilege of being president of the United States, whatever pardon request comes before me, I'll always give a thoughtful, prayerful consideration."
Around a dozen people in the crowd said they were still making up their minds on whom to support. Some were looking for a Trump alternative, but not all considered the charges against him disqualifying.
"I feel bad that the country has to go through that, never mind Trump himself," Fran York said of the prosecutions of Mr. Trump. "I'm not sure that what he did was so bad that he should be indicted."
Mr. York, who is supporting Mr. Pence, said he would vote for Mr. Trump again if he won the nomination.
Mr. Scott, who has said little about the election indictment, went to Yuma, Ariz., to promote his plan to spend $ 10 billion on the border wall started by Mr. Trump. There, too, he repeated his accusation that the Justice Department was "hunting Republicans."
"My perspective is that the D.O.J. continues to weaponize their power against political opponents," he said, deflecting a question from an NBC reporter about whether Mr. Trump's legal cases were dominating the campaign.
Perhaps the only candidate other than Mr. Trump who was eager to talk about the indictment was Mr. Christie, who has focused his campaign on undercutting the former president. Mr. Christie has struggled to break 3 percent in recent polling of the contest.
"It's an aggressive indictment," he said from a train headed to Kyiv, Ukraine, on Thursday night. "But what I believe is a much more important question than the criminality, in the context of this campaign season, is the fact that he's morally responsible for Jan. 6."

Richard O. Simpson, Nation's First Consumer Safety Chief, Dies at 93: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As Nixon's choice to lead the Consumer Product Safety Commission, he protected the public from buying 25 million risky goods.
Richard O. Simpson, a self-made Republican businessman who as the first chairman of the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission aggressively protected the American public from buying millions of risky goods, died on July 21 in DeLand, Fla., north of Orlando. He was 93.
His death, in a hospital near his home, was confirmed by his daughter Karen Simpson Tweedie.
Mr. Simpson was appointed to the commission by President Richard M. Nixon in 1973, shortly after it was created by a Democratic Congress. He immediately made the agency's work broadly transparent to the public.
He was so assertive that when the surgeon general declared that smoking was a health hazard, Mr. Simpson proposed banning the sale of cigarettes altogether, a prerogative that he later acknowledged was beyond the commission's jurisdiction.
Still, during his three-year tenure, the commission declared some 25 million items unsafe and demanded that they be recalled, repaired or replaced. They included flammable mattresses, TV antennas that could lead to electrocution and pill bottles without child-resistant caps.
"He was the first and best of the numerous heads of the commission, and he was still monitoring and pushing the commission from his retirement," the consumer advocate Ralph Nader said by phone.
"He believed in law enforcement," Mr. Nader added. "He didn't have his antenna out for the corporate lobbyists, like most new regulatory agencies."
Mr. Simpson's challenge was to balance "unreasonable risk" with the impact that retooling a product would have on the financial cost both to consumers and manufacturers and to the economy more broadly. A regulatory decision concerning a product could result in halted production and job layoffs and carry "the potential for industry dislocation, the loss of choice by consumers and the likely impact on prices," as Mr. Simpson put it.
Acknowledging at a Congressional budget hearing that his agency had a "frightening amount of authority," he declared that its power had to be exercised prudently.
"If you tried to build every house so it couldn't burn," he told The Christian Science Monitor, "you might well triple the cost -- and you might not want to live in it."
On one birthday, his wife gave him a present that exemplified the potential for overreach: a toothpick with both ends safely swaddled in cotton. The accompanying card read: "Your birthday gift has been approved by the U.S. Safety Commission."
Richard Olin Simpson was born on March 7, 1930, in Independence, Mo., the sixth of nine children of Clyde and Lily (Holler) Simpson. His father was a carpenter, but the family was impoverished. Mr. Simpson recalled having to wait in line to collect welfare payments.
He was the first member of his family to finish high school. After enlisting in the Navy and serving during the Korean War, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1956. He briefly studied law there before enrolling in graduate engineering courses at Stanford University.
Mr. Simpson started an engineering firm that specialized in naval electronics and weapon systems; became vice president of the Rucker Company, an electronics firm, which introduced a protective device that guarded against electrocution; and ran an engineering services firm. In 1969, he joined the U.S. Commerce Department, where he helped shape safety standards for children's sleepwear.
He was acting assistant secretary for science and technology when he was appointed chairman of the consumer commission.
With its first vote, the commission stunned manufacturers by refusing to delay the effective date of a standard for mattress flammability.
It banned the rear step on tricycles -- bikes ranking at the top of its consumer product hazard index -- to keep other children from hitching rides and falling off; regulated butane cigarette lighters that produced flames the length of three cigars; and urged the recall of powerful adhesives that glued the user's fingers together.
His commitment to child-resistant caps on medicine containers was personal. Years earlier, two of his children had to have their stomachs pumped after digesting too many candy-flavored aspirin tablets while playing doctor.
"We have taken an agency born in controversy, during a period of very low government credibility, and, by abolishing the restraints that secrecy imposes, have created an agency that people can believe in," he told The New York Times in 1975.
Mr. Simpson left the commission in early 1976 after Gerald R. Ford had succeeded Nixon as president, frustrated with political interference by the White House over staff appointments and delays over whether he would be reappointed. (The current chairman is Alexander Hoehn-Saric, who was nominated by President Biden.)
Mr. Simpson later returned to the private sector -- recommending that the product industry police itself -- and wrote a book, "The Quest for Safer Products" (2016).
He married Patricia Ann Kramer in 1949; she died in 2003. In addition to his daughter Karen, he is survived by his children Dianne Tuohy, Norma Simpson Bufford and Richard and David Simpson; 13 grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren.
As a reminder of the balancing act between consumers and the broader public interest that every commission decision entailed, Mr. Simpson's clutter-free desk at the agency was dominated by a single ornament. Like the toothpick, it was a gift from his wife: A lead sculpture of a boy, crouching, preparing to spring into a handstand.

Heat Is Costing the U.S. Economy Billions in Lost Productivity

As much of the United States swelters under record heat, Amazon drivers and warehouse workers have gone on strike in part to protest working conditions that can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
On triple-digit days in Orlando, Florida, utility crews are postponing checks for gas leaks, since digging outdoors dressed in heavy safety gear could endanger their lives. Even in Michigan, on the nation’s northern border, construction crews are working shortened days because of heat.
Now that climate change has raised Earth’s temperatures to the highest levels in recorded history, with projections showing that they will only climb higher, new research shows the impact of heat on workers is spreading across the economy and lowering productivity.
Extreme heat is regularly affecting workers beyond expected industries such as agriculture and construction. Sizzling temperatures are causing problems for those who work in factories, warehouses and restaurants and also for employees of airlines and telecommunications firms, delivery services and energy companies. Even home health aides are running into trouble.
“We’ve known for a very long time that human beings are very sensitive to temperature, and that their performance declines dramatically when exposed to heat, but what we haven’t known until very recently is whether and how those lab responses meaningfully extrapolate to the real-world economy,” said R. Jisung Park, an environmental and labor economist at the University of Pennsylvania. “And what we are learning is that hotter temperatures appear to muck up the gears of the economy in many more ways than we would have expected.”
A study published in June on the effects of temperature on productivity concludes that although extreme heat harms agriculture, its impact is greater on industrial and other sectors of the economy, in part because they are more labor-intensive. It finds that heat increases absenteeism and reduces work hours, and concludes that as the planet continues to warm, those losses will increase.
The cost is high. In 2021, more than 2.5 billion hours of labor in the U.S. agriculture, construction, manufacturing and service sectors were lost to heat exposure, according to data compiled by The Lancet. Another report found that in 2020, the loss of labor as a result of heat exposure cost the economy about $100 billion, a figure projected to grow to $500 billion annually by 2050.
Other research found that as the mercury reaches 90 degrees, productivity slumps by about 25%, and when it goes past 100 degrees, productivity drops off by 70%.
And the effects are unequally distributed: In poor counties, workers lose as much as 5% of their pay with each hot day, researchers have found. In wealthy counties, the loss is less than 1%.
Of the many economic costs of climate change — dying crops, spiking insurance rates, flooded properties — the loss of productivity caused by heat is emerging as one of the biggest, experts say.
“We know that the impacts of climate change are costing the economy,” said Kathy Baughman McLeod, director of the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center and a former global executive for environmental and social risk at Bank of America. “The losses associated with people being hot at work, and the slowdowns and mistakes people make as a result are a huge part.”
Still, there are no national regulations to protect workers from extreme heat. In 2021, the Biden administration announced that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration would propose the first rule designed to protect workers from heat exposure. But two years later, the agency still has not released a draft of the proposed regulation.
Seven states have some form of labor protections dealing with heat, but there has been a push to roll them back in some places. In June, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a law that eliminated rules set by municipalities that mandated water breaks for construction workers, even though Texas leads all states in terms of lost productivity linked to heat, according to an analysis of federal data conducted by Vivid Economics.
Business groups are opposed to a national standard, saying it would be too expensive because it would probably require rest, water and shade breaks and possibly the installation of air conditioning.
“OSHA should take care not to impose further regulatory burdens that make it more difficult for small businesses to grow their businesses and create jobs,” David Addington, vice president of the National Federation of Independent Business, wrote in response to OSHA’s plan to write a regulation.
Marc Freedman, vice president of employment policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said, “I don’t think anyone is dismissing the hazard of overexposure to heat.” But, he said, “is an OSHA standard the right way to do it? A lot of employers are already taking measures, and the question will be: What more do they have to do?”
The National Beef slaughterhouse in Dodge City, Kansas, where temperatures are expected to hover above 100 degrees for the next week, is cooled by fans, not air conditioning.
Workers wear heavy protective aprons and helmets and use water vats and hoses heated to 180 degrees to sanitize their equipment. It has always been hot work.
But this year is different, said one worker, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution. The heat inside the slaughterhouse is intense, drenching employees in sweat and making it hard to get through a shift, the worker said.
National Beef did not respond to emails or telephone calls requesting comment.
Martin Rosas, a union representative for meatpacking and food processing workers in Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, said sweltering conditions present a risk for food contamination. After workers skin a hide, they need to ensure that debris doesn’t get on the meat or carcass. “But when it’s extremely hot, and their safety glasses fog up, their vision is impaired and they are exhausted, they can’t even see what they’re doing,” Rosas said.
Almost 200 employees out of roughly 2,500 have quit at the Dodge City National Beef plant since May, Rosas said. That’s about 10% higher than usual for that time period, he said.
But even some workers in air-conditioned settings are getting too hot. McDonald’s workers in Los Angeles walked off the job this summer as the air-conditioned kitchens were overwhelmed by the sweltering heat outside.
“There is an air conditioner in every part of the store, but the thermostat in the kitchen still showed it was over 100 degrees,” said Maria Rodriguez, who has worked at the same McDonald's on Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles for 20 years but walked out July 21, sacrificing a day of pay. “It’s been hot before, but never like this summer. I felt terrible — like I could pass out or faint at any moment.”
Nicole Enearu, owner of the store, said in a statement, “We understand that there’s an uncomfortable heat wave in LA, which is why we’re even more focused on ensuring the safety of our employees inside our restaurants. Our air conditioning is functioning properly at this location.”
Tony Hedgepeth, a home health aide in Richmond, Virginia, cares for a client whose home thermostat is typically set at about 82 degrees. Last week, the temperature inside was near 94 degrees.
Any heat is a challenge in Hedgepeth’s job. “Bathing, cooking, lifting and moving him, cleaning him,” he said. “It’s all physical. It’s a lot of sweat.”
Warehouse workers across the country are also feeling the heat. Sersie Cobb, a forklift driver who stocks boxes of pasta in a warehouse in Columbia, South Carolina, said the stifling heat can make it difficult to breathe. “Sometimes I get dizzy and start seeing dots,” Cobb said. “My vision starts to go black. I stop work immediately when that happens. Two times this summer I’ve had heart palpitations from the heat, and left work early to go to the ER.”
In Southern California, a group of 84 striking Amazon delivery workers say that one of their priorities is getting the company to make it safe to work in extreme heat. Last month, unionized UPS workers won a victory when the company agreed to install air conditioning in delivery trucks.
“Heat has played a tremendous role — it was one of the major issues in the negotiations,” said Carthy Boston, a member of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters representing UPS drivers in Washington, D.C. “Those trucks are hotboxes.”
Many factories were built decades ago for a different climate and are not air-conditioned. A study on the effects of extreme temperatures on the productivity of auto plants in the United States found that a week with six or more days of heat exceeding 90 degrees cuts production by an average of 8%.
In Tulsa, Oklahoma, Navistar is installing a $19 million air conditioning system at its IC Bus factory, which produces many of America’s school buses. Temperatures on the floor can reach 99 degrees. Currently, the plant is only cooled by overhead fans that swirl high above the assembly line.
Shane Anderson, the company’s interim manager, said air conditioning is expected to cost about $183 per hour, or between $275,000 and $500,000 per year — but the company believes it will boost worker productivity.
Other employers are also adapting.
Brad Maurer, vice president of Leidal and Hart, which builds stadiums, hospitals and factories in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, said managers now bring in pallets of bottled water, which they didn’t used to do, at a cost to the company of a few thousand dollars per month.
Rising heat around Detroit recently caused his employees to stop working three hours early on a Ford Motors facility for several days in a row — a pattern emerging throughout his company’s work sites.
“It means costs go up, production goes down, we may not meet schedules, and guys and women don’t get paychecks,” Maurer said.
Labor experts say that as employers adapt to the new reality of the changing climate, they will have to pay one way or the other.
“The truth is that the changes required probably will be very costly, and they will get passed on to employers and consumers,” said David Michaels, who served as assistant secretary of labor at OSHA during the Obama administration and is now a professor at the George Washington School of Public Health. “But if we don’t want these workers to get killed, we will have to pay that cost.”

Labor Dept. Condemns National Surge in Exploitation of Child Workers: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The agency said it had found thousands of cases where minors were employed in illegal, often dangerous jobs. Congress has accused the health secretary of failing to protect them.
The Labor Department on Thursday denounced a national surge in child labor, saying the agency's inspectors had found thousands of violations and were investigating a slaughterhouse where a 16-year-old boy from Guatemala was killed this month.
The update followed a hearing on Wednesday in which lawmakers from both parties accused the Health and Human Services secretary, Xavier Becerra, of failing to protect migrant children from exploitation. His agency is tasked with releasing them to safe living conditions after they cross the border by themselves.
"There are some terrible things that are wrong," Representative Anna G. Eshoo, a Democrat from California, told him. "At the end of the day, as H.H.S. secretary, the buck stops with you."
Some 300,000 minors have come to this country alone since 2021, fueling a dramatic increase in migrant child labor. In an online report, the Labor Department announced an 87 percent increase in fines on employers in recent months. Companies including lumber mills and roofing contractors have been hit with $ 6.6 million in penalties.
The department said that inspectors were pursuing more than 700 open cases and had already found 4,474 children working illegally since the start of the fiscal year -- a 44 percent increase over the previous year.
The acting labor secretary, Julie Su, said the administration was "leaving no stone unturned to root out exploitative child labor."
The agency vowed to ramp up enforcement and create a child labor task force in February, days after The New York Times reported that unaccompanied minors were being forced into some of the nation's most grueling jobs.
The Times found cases of 12-year-olds working construction, 13-year-olds washing hotel sheets and 15-year-olds packaging Cheerios overnight. One boy was released to a man in Florida who promised to put him in school but instead threatened him, demanding money. "Don't mess with me," the man wrote. "You don't mean anything to me."
These children were released to sponsors by the H.H.S. shelter system, which is supposed to pair children with responsible adults. As more and more minors began entering the country after President Biden took office, his administration ramped up pressure on the agency to place the children more quickly. It rolled back protections that had been in place for years, including some background checks, and Mr. Becerra urged staff members to move with the speed of a Henry Ford assembly line.
On Wednesday, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce questioned Mr. Becerra for three hours about the rising number of children falling prey to exploitation.
Lawmakers also pressed him on instances of retaliation against whistle-blowers. Workers said they had tried to warn Mr. Becerra and the White House that migrant children were being sent to unsafe homes, only to be punished for speaking out. One worker said her building access was revoked during her lunch break after she raised alarms about a 14-year-old whose sponsor made him work off a debt.
"Thanks to The New York Times, we know that reports reached your desk that children were at risk," said the committee chair, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican from Washington. "The American people must know how you could possibly have ignored these warning signs."
Mr. Becerra told lawmakers that his department was increasing its services for children. "This is real, it's repulsive and it's unacceptable," he said.
A new accountability team at H.H.S. will try to spot problems with the vetting of sponsors. For years, the agency released most children with little follow-up beyond a phone call. But now, the department says, it is on track to give all children case management services by 2024.
Lawmakers from both parties have introduced bills to increase civil penalties for child labor violations. But these efforts have stalled amid partisan gridlock, and politicians have begun looking for other ways to apply pressure. House Democrats last week launched a task force to fight child labor and also requested a federal audit to quantify the scope of the problem.
The Labor Department said it would continue to focus on finding companies that rely on child workers and also to hold brands accountable, not just their manufacturers and staffing agencies. The agency has stepped up its use of the "hot goods" legal provision, which can prohibit any interstate transport of products when child labor is involved. The department used the rule last month on a Minnesota factory run by Monogram Meat Snacks, a national supplier of jerky.
In a statement, Monogram said it had "immediately terminated the two ineligible workers" and had made "companywide changes" to prevent underage labor in the future.
Last year, a 10th grader from Central America told The Times that many young teenagers worked at Monogram when they first arrived in the United States until they could find better jobs. He had worked there himself, he said, until he found a higher-paying job sawing planks of wood each night until 5 a.m. He needed the extra money to catch up on the rent he owed his sponsor.

G.M.'s Electric Vehicle Rollout Delayed by Slow Battery Production: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Boudette, Neal E

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company is earning big profits on gasoline cars and trucks but is struggling to catch up to Tesla in the fastest-growing segment of the auto market.
General Motors is investing tens of billions of dollars to produce new electric vehicles and, it hopes, catch up to Tesla.
But those ambitious goals appear distant. This year, the company is struggling to produce a new electric car battery pack meant for the electric vehicles it plans to introduce over several years.
On Tuesday, G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said the delays were "disappointing" and stemmed from a supplier's inability to deliver automated manufacturing machinery.
"We are working on multiple fronts to put this behind us," she said in a conference call with analysts.
Many investors are increasingly worried about the company's plans because electric vehicles are the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry and are the most important piece of Ms. Barra's long-term strategy for G.M.
The company's share price was down 3.5 percent at the close of trading on Tuesday.
A big fear for investors is that G.M., Ford Motor and other large automakers stand to lose customers as more drivers buy battery-powered cars. In China, Europe and California, where electric vehicles account for a significant and growing share of new car sales, once dominant automakers like Volkswagen and Toyota have been losing market share to Tesla and Chinese automakers like BYD.
Two years ago, Ms. Barra said, G.M. aimed to double annual revenue by 2030, to about $ 280 billion. Much of the increased business is supposed to come from electric vehicles, and new revenue from software and services linked to those cars and trucks. The company has also set a goal of phasing out internal combustion models by 2035.
Right now, G.M. is "way behind where they should be," said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, a consulting firm. "If they're having trouble with the first wave of these new E.V.s, and if they can't roll them out, that's not good for the next wave of higher-volume models."
In the first half of this year, G.M. built just 50,000 electric vehicles, and about 80 percent were Chevrolet Bolts that use an older battery pack made by a supplier. In the United States, G.M. sold fewer than 2,800 vehicles that used its new, modular Ultium battery packs, which are made at an Ohio factory that the company owns with LG Energy Solution. Two other Ultium factories are under construction, in Tennessee and Michigan.
Ms. Barra said G.M. was sticking with a previous forecast that it would make 400,000 electric vehicles in North America from 2022 to 2024, and it is expected to make 100,000 in the second half of this year. But she did not repeat an earlier prediction that the company would make more than one million in 2025, most of which were supposed to use Ultium technology.
Ultium battery packs are made from Lego-like modules that can be combined in different sizes. By using them in many vehicles, from compact cars to large pickups, G.M. hopes to reap economies of scale and gain a cost advantage over other automakers.
G.M. had said it would stop making the Bolt, but Ms. Barra said the company now planned to update the car with Ultium technology.
For now, the sluggish electric vehicle rollout isn't hurting the company's bottom line. G.M. said on Tuesday that it made a profit of $ 2.6 billion from April to June, an increase of 52 percent from a year earlier. Revenue totaled $ 44.7 billion, up 25 percent.
G.M.'s chief financial officer, Paul Jacobson, said the company had benefited from higher prices and strong sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles in North America. The average price of the vehicles that G.M. sold in the second quarter was $ 52,000 -- about $ 1,600 more than in the first quarter of the year.
G.M. sold 833,000 cars and trucks in North America in the second quarter, a 26 percent increase from a year earlier. In the rest of the world, it sold 147,000 vehicles, about 8,000 fewer than a year earlier.
Mr. Jacobson also said G.M. now expected to earn $ 9.3 billion to $ 10.7 billion this year, up from a previous target of $ 8.4 billion to $ 9.9 billion. The company also expects to reduce costs by $ 3 billion by the end of 2024, $ 1 billion more than an earlier forecast.
The company could struggle to hit its financial targets this year if the United Auto Workers go on strike. The company's contract with the U.A.W. ends in September and management and union officials recently started negotiating a new deal. The union has taken a more aggressive posture to the talks under a new president, Shawn Fain.
G.M. currently offers only a few vehicles that use Ultium batteries. They include the Cadillac Lyriq, an S.U.V.; the GMC Hummer, which has a starting price of about $ 90,0000; and large delivery vans made by a new division called BrightDrop.
This summer and fall, G.M. is supposed to add three electric Chevrolets -- the Blazer and Equinox S.U.V.s and an electric Silverado pickup. The company had previously said the Silverado would go on sale in the spring, but the truck is now not expected until the fall.

Full text: The sun's rays cause the majority of skin changes as you grow older. Here's how sunscreen helps prevent the damage.
Have you ever looked at the skin on the buttocks of a 90-year-old? Dr. Fayne Frey has. "It's beautiful," said the dermatologist and author of the book "The Skincare Hoax." "There's very little pigment, there's very little wrinkling, there are very few blood vessels."
Compare that to the skin on a nonagenarian's face, where you'll likely see brown spots, scaliness, visible blood vessels, much more wrinkling and a generally sallow appearance.
Some signs of aging, namely fine lines, happen naturally over time. But Dr. Frey said that as much as 80 percent of the skin changes we associate with age are actually caused by the sun's ultraviolet rays. The best way to avoid them, aside from staying indoors, in the shade or permanently covered up? Sunscreen.
Sunscreen's ability to block sunburns and prevent skin cancer is well known, but many dermatologists say it's also the best skin care product for slowing signs of aging. Here's what to know about how UV rays cause the skin to age and how sunscreen helps to minimize those effects.
How UV rays damage the skin
There are two categories of ultraviolet light: A and B. UVB wavelengths are shorter and primarily affect the top layer of the skin. UVA rays are longer and can penetrate deeper (they can also travel through glass, so don't assume a window keeps you safe from sun damage).
Years of exposure to both UVA and UVB rays damages cells on the top layer of the skin, called keratinocytes. When that happens, the skin starts to look red, rough and scaly in patches -- a condition called actinic keratosis.
"It's due to DNA mutations that occur specifically in the keratinocytes, and they then proliferate and become abnormal," said Dr. Lena Von Schuckmann, a dermatologist and clinician researcher at the University of Queensland in Australia. In some cases, actinic keratosis can become cancerous.
Below the keratinocytes are the melanocytes -- the cells that produce melanin and cause the skin to darken. UVA rays primarily activate these cells, resulting in a suntan. (Sunburn is different; it's caused by UVB rays injuring the top layer of the skin.) With long-term UV exposure, the melanocytes become damaged, resulting in permanent hyperpigmentation. These brown spots are sometimes called sunspots, age spots, liver spots or their technical name, solar lentigines.
Collagen and elastin, which keep the skin elastic and supple, reside in the next layer down. UVA rays trigger the breakdown of those proteins, causing wrinkles as the skin loses its elasticity, as well as the thinning of skin, making blood vessels more visible.
There's no real way to boost collagen and elastin artificially (there's scant evidence for the power of supplements and creams), but cells called fibroblasts do continue to make the proteins as you age, although production slows down. As a result, some dermatologists say it may be possible to reverse some signs of aging.
If you start using sunscreen early and consistently enough, "and the fibroblast is still young enough or healthy enough to be able to produce more collagen," the appearance of wrinkles could diminish over time, said Dr. Henry Lim, a dermatologist at Henry Ford Health and a former president of the American Academy of Dermatology. The key is making sure collagen levels aren't depleted further by sun exposure while the cells work to replenish the protein.
But Dr. Von Schuckmann said the jury is still out: "We certainly have studies to show that sunscreen used on a daily basis reduces skin aging. Whether or not it reverses skin aging, that's a little bit tricky to differentiate."
How sunscreen prevents signs of aging
Sunscreen stops damage by blocking UV rays from reaching and penetrating the skin. There are two types of sunscreen ingredients: mineral and chemical.
Mineral ingredients, namely zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, act as a physical barrier, reflecting the ultraviolet light off the skin. (Our eyes can detect that reflection of light, which is why these sunscreens appear to leave a white cast.) Chemical ingredients -- such as avobenzone, oxybenzone and homosalate -- absorb the UV rays. Both types of sunscreen can degrade or wash off over time, so it's important to reapply every two hours, and more frequently if you're swimming or sweating.
In general, sunscreens are more effective at stopping the shorter UVB rays than the longer UVA rays. Sun protection factor, or SPF, only refers to how well the sunscreen prevents a sunburn, meaning how well it blocks UVB.
Dr. Frey said that just a few ingredients approved for use in the United States -- namely avobenzone, oxybenzone, zinc oxide and, to a lesser degree, titanium dioxide -- block UVA. To make sure a sunscreen provides UVA protection, look for one with these ingredients, or check that it's labeled "broad spectrum," which means that it stops the longer wavelengths from penetrating. (Newer ingredients available in Europe are more effective against UVA; some are in the pipeline for review by the Food and Drug Administration.)
When it comes to choosing the best sunscreen to prevent signs of aging, Dr. Von Schuckmann advised looking for one that's broad spectrum and SPF 50 or higher; whether it's a chemical or mineral formulation doesn't matter. The most important thing, she added, is that it "actually goes onto the skin every single morning."

Theater in America Is Facing a Crisis as Many Stages Go Dark: [National Desk]

Full text: There is less theater in America these days. Fewer venues. Fewer productions. Fewer performances.
Cal Shakes, a Bay Area favorite that staged Shakespeare in an outdoor amphitheater, is producing no shows this year. Chicago's Lookingglass Theater, where Mary Zimmerman's "Metamorphoses" had its premiere before coming to Broadway, has halted programming until next spring. The Williamstown Theater Festival, known for its star-studded summer shows, has no fully staged productions at its Western Massachusetts home this season.
The coronavirus pandemic and its aftermath have left the industry in crisis. Interviews with 72 top-tier regional theaters located outside New York City reveal that they expect, in aggregate, to produce 20 percent fewer productions next season than they did in the last full season before the pandemic, which shuttered theaters across the country, in many cases for 18 months or more. And many of the shows that they are programming will have shorter runs, smaller casts and simpler sets.
Seattle's ACT Theater has reduced the length of each show's run by a week. In Los Angeles, the Geffen Playhouse will no longer schedule performances on Tuesdays, its slowest night. Philadelphia's Arden Theater Company expects to give 363 performances next season, down from 503 performances the season before the pandemic.
Why is this happening? Costs are up, the government assistance that kept many theaters afloat at the height of the pandemic has mostly been spent, and audiences are smaller than they were before the pandemic, a byproduct of shifting lifestyles (less commuting, more streaming), some concern about the downtown neighborhoods in which many large nonprofit theaters are situated (worries about public safety), and broken habits (many former patrons, particularly older people, have not returned).
"It's impossible not to be distraught about the state of the field," said Christopher Moses, an artistic director of the Alliance Theater in Atlanta. "It's clear this is the hardest time to be producing nonprofit theater, maybe in the history of the nonprofit movement."
The number of nonprofit theaters in America had grown significantly in the two decades before the pandemic, but many small and midsize companies are now closing. Just last month, Book-It Repertory Theater in Seattle, Triad Stage in Greensboro, N.C., and Unexpected Stage Company in Maryland announced they were closing. Chicago, a city proud of its vibrant storefront theater scene, has lost at least a half-dozen companies.
"We're seeing two to three organizations closing a month right now," said Greg Reiner, the director of theater and musical theater at the National Endowment for the Arts.
There are substantial layoffs and cuts taking place at some of the field's biggest institutions: This month New York's prestigious Public Theater cut 19 percent of its jobs; just before that the powerhouse Brooklyn Academy of Music cut 13 percent and the sprawling Center Theater Group of Los Angeles cut 10 percent. The Dallas Theater Center has cut its full-time staff nearly in half, to 38 from 70, since last fall.
The pandemic exacerbated many trends that had long challenged nonprofit theaters, including the steady erosions of subscribers -- the loyal audience members who sign up in advance to see most or all of a season's shows. Hartford Stage and Kansas City Repertory Theater have each lost half of their subscribers since the pandemic, leaving them far more reliant on single-ticket buyers, whose purchase patterns are unpredictable and who tend to be less interested in unfamiliar work.
A new survey conducted by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Census Bureau found that 10.3 percent of American adults attended a musical last year, down from 16.5 percent in 2017; just 4.5 percent attended a play, down from 9.4 percent.
At the same time the costs of making theater have risen significantly because of inflation, labor market issues (the Great Resignation led to significant staff turnover, so both recruitment and retention costs have risen), and social justice concerns (many theater workers have successfully argued that they were undercompensated). "As we work toward a more equitable work force, the cost of producing theater goes up," said Ross Egan, managing director of Asolo Repertory Theater in Sarasota, Fla.
Even as they cut staff positions and hire fewer actors and freelance artists, many theaters are awash in red ink after running through the government aid that helped sustain them during the height of the pandemic. "I've been here 20 years, and at some point in the spring I started to realize this would be the greatest and largest deficit in my history," said Paul R. Tetreault, the director of Ford's Theater Society in Washington, D.C.
Why cut back on shows? "We don't have the demand for it, so why would we try to act like we do?" said Ken-Matt Martin, the interim artistic director at Baltimore Center Stage and the Arkansas Repertory Theater. And many nonprofits run shows at a loss, with even strong ticket sales unable to cover production costs, leaving them reliant on philanthropy to make up the difference. "We all lose money by doing productions," said Angel Ysaguirre, the executive director of Court Theater in Chicago. "We'll be losing less money by cutting one production."
The crisis has led to a new spirit of collaboration, and an enormous increase in coproductions in which several theaters come together to produce shows and share the costs of sets, costumes and creative teams. In the season before the pandemic only one of the six shows at Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington, D.C., was a coproduction; next season at least five of its six shows will be coproductions.
"It's a sea change," said Simon Godwin, the theater's artistic director. "There's an economic imperative, but also a sense of sharing the challenge of making theater now."
Theaters are looking for other ways to share costs. Several in Connecticut are exploring whether they could consolidate their set-building operations, and a group in Chicago is discussing whether it's possible to share back-office functions like human resources, finance and marketing.
Many theaters are trying to make money by renting out their buildings. Some are finding other ways to raise funds. Northern Stage, in White River Junction, Vt., decided to get a liquor license. "While this is certainly auxiliary to our mission," said Jason Smoller, the theater's managing director, "it will represent a not insignificant revenue stream, and it undoubtedly improves the experience for our patrons."
There are varying reports about how well philanthropy is holding up, but many theater leaders express concern about donor fatigue after the pandemic, and some say foundations are shifting away from support for the arts toward health, human services and social justice. "What's happening now, just in the last few months, is that really large, steadfast, institutional donors are reprioritizing and moving away from arts funding," said Nora DeVeau-Rosen, managing director of Two River Theater in Red Bank, N.J. "We've lost 11 percent of our institutional support in the last three months, and we anticipate that continuing."
Nonprofit theaters, many of which strive to produce new work and artistically adventurous fare, are doing far less well than touring Broadway productions, which are often juggernauts and jukebox musicals. Nonprofit theaters are also lagging behind Broadway itself, where attendance levels are now 91 percent of where they were at the same time before the pandemic.
There are a handful of nonprofits that say they are doing just fine, with a variety of theories about why: Some minimized the length of time they were closed during the pandemic; others cite populist programming choices; and some are in midsize cities with a less competitive performing arts market and strong civic support.
But far more say they are facing serious challenges. "Clearly the financial model for most regional theaters is profoundly in trouble," said Stuart Carden, the artistic director of Kansas City Repertory Theater.
Some artistic directors believe that programming is partly at fault -- that some theaters have turned off audiences by choosing shows that are too downbeat or preachily political. "Some theaters have forgotten what audiences want -- they want to laugh and to be joyful and to cry, but sometimes we push them too far," said Timothy J. Evans, executive director of Northlight Theater in Skokie, Ill. But numerous theaters say they are still finding at least occasional success with edgy or challenging titles.
In Kansas City, Carden said audience behavior has been volatile: A new Sherlock Holmes-themed comedy by Kate Hamill called "Ms. Holmes & Ms. Watson -- Apt. 2B" vastly outsold expectations, but a production of Marco Ramirez's acclaimed play "The Royale," about a champion boxer who confronted racism, "barely sold."
"There's been so much heartache and pain, a lot of people are looking for a joyous experience and a guaranteed good time," Carden said.
In California, Pasadena Playhouse saw big demand for a series of Sondheim-related shows, but then struggled with Martyna Majok's immigration-themed "Sanctuary City." "It was an artistic high point by every metric possible, but we could not get people to pay attention," said Danny Feldman, the theater's producing artistic director.
Meanwhile, theater leaders are grasping for signs of hope, or at least faith.
"I've had many dark nights of the soul -- who is going to survive, and how is the field going to survive?" said Taibi Magar, one of two artistic directors at Philadelphia Theater Company. "But then some days I wake up and remember that this art form is thousands of years old, and it has survived so many terrible moments. It will move and morph into its next phase."
Photograph Plays like "Sanctuary City," above, struggled to draw crowds. Hartford Stage and the Kansas City Repertory Theater have lost half of their subscribers since Covid, too.

Full text: Edward Kaprov's wet-plate technique is producing some of the most memorable and timeless photographs of the war in Ukraine close up.
The news coverage from Ukraine has been so intense and widespread over the past 16 months that it may seem that the war has been covered to the point of saturation. Yet for all the wealth of film and photographs to come out of the war, there have been significant gaps, most notable a shortage of combat photography.
That is not so much for dint of trying, but because of the difficulty of access to the front lines. Photographers are often restricted to press tours and kept well back from the zero line, as the first line is known. As a result, the most memorable photography emerging from the war has been the civilian aspect, urban destruction and the human cost.
A new photo exhibition by the Israeli freelance photographer Edward Kaprov goes a significant way to remedy that, and stands out for its timeless images of war at the front.
Kaprov, 48, has turned to one of the earliest of photographic techniques, wet plate collodion photography, invented in 1851, to produce images -- mostly portraits of soldiers, medics, morgue workers and a smattering of civilians -- that his peers are describing as one of the most powerful collection of images of the war in Ukraine to date.
He happily points out that wet plate photography, which produces unique images on A4 size glass plates, is an absurdly complicated and cumbersome method in the digital age and in a war zone, but it is one he embraces for all kinds of personal and historical connections.
One of the earliest wars documented with photographs was the Crimean War, in the middle of the 19th century. The British photographer Roger Fenton used the same wet plate technique to record the participants and the landscape of war, including a celebrated image, "the Valley of the Shadow of Death." "I wanted to close a certain logical circle," Kaprov said in an interview this week.
The first photographs that exist of the Holy Land are also from the same technique, he added.
Born and raised in the Soviet Union, Kaprov moved to Israel 30 years ago, where he embarked on a career in photography. Much of his work has focused on themes of his motherland, the Soviet Union, and the homeland, Israel, both of which he describes as shattered utopias.
He has used the wet plate technique for a seven-year project documenting life along the borders of Israel and found it an obvious choice to produce something distinctive in Ukraine.
"This technique is doing something else," he said. "It's how I can go deeper."
He kitted out a Ford Transit van, turning it into a mobile laboratory, and loading it with 300 kilograms of chemicals and water and more than 100 glass plates, driving it into Ukraine soon after the full-scale invasion by Russia last year.
He uses a box camera that he compares laughingly to an accordion "with all its bells and whistles." The subject has to stand or sit stock-still in order for him to produce a sharp image and the photographer has 10 to 15 minutes to develop the photograph before the emulsion on the glass plate dries.
Most of his subjects are soldiers or in units attached to the military. They are photographed not in action, as much modern war photography focuses on, but nevertheless at their positions, in their tanks and armored vehicles, in trenches or under the trees.
They are poised with a stillness that is a necessary part of the process to ensure a clear image with a lengthy exposure. The viewer is drawn in by the sharp clarity of the face of the subject, or the white of a cigarette or the glint of an eye, while the surrounds and even the companions are blurred in a timeless, other worldly landscape. Some of the images are unforgettable: a morgue physician bent over a corpse looking at the camera, a soldier smoking in a trench, an old couple hugging in the ruins.
"When you look at them the first impression is this was 100 years ago," Kaprov said. On a closer look it is clear the soldiers have modern weapons and equipment. "I want to confuse the audience," he went on. "I want the act of comparing them with past wars, because in fact nothing has changed. Maybe the weapons and cellphones have changed, but the essence of war does not change."
When Russia invaded Ukraine last year, there was no question for Kaprov that he would travel there to report on the war, even if he had no assignment. He has worked alone, without editorial feedback or financial backup, working "like an obsessive," as he described it himself.
"It was like war came to my house, it's my people," he said. "Actually it's my people on both sides."
His family history makes it deeply personal. His grandparents were from Zhytomyr in Ukraine, and he was born and raised in Chelyabinsk, in Russia. When he was born it was all one country, the Soviet Union, but now the current leaders of his motherland, Russia, is attacking the land of his grandparents.
"The Ukrainians suffer the most and what Russia is doing is not right," he said. "But they are my family and friends also, and some politicians are trying to steal my motherland, taking the last that I have."

Full text: The writers say Hollywood studios are increasingly limiting their roles in television productions, highlighting a trend for white-collar workers.
For the six years he worked on "The Mentalist," beginning in 2009, Jordan Harper's job was far more than a writing gig. He and his colleagues in the writers' room of the weekly CBS drama were heavily involved in production. They weighed in on costumes and props, lingered on the set, provided feedback to actors and directors. The job lasted most of a year.
But by 2018, when he worked on "Hightown," a drama for Starz, the business of television writing had changed substantially. The writers spent about 20 weeks cranking out scripts, at which point most of their contracts ended, leaving many to scramble for additional work. The job of overseeing the filming and editing fell largely to the showrunner, the writer-producer in charge of a series.
"On a show like 'The Mentalist,' we'd all go to set," Mr. Harper said. "Now the other writers are cut free. Only the showrunner and possibly one other writer are kept on board."
The separation between writing and production, increasingly common in the streaming era, is one issue at the heart of the strike begun in May by roughly 11,500 Hollywood writers. They say the new approach requires more frequent job changes, making their work less steady, and has lowered writers' earnings. Mr. Harper estimated that his income was less than half what it was seven years ago.
While their union, the Writers Guild of America, has sought guarantees that each show will employ a minimum number of writers through the production process, the major studios have said such proposals are "incompatible with the creative nature of our industry." The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood studios, declined to comment further.
SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union that went on strike last week, said its members had also felt the effects of the streaming era. While many acting jobs had long been shorter than those of writers, the union's executive director, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, said studios' "extreme level of efficiency management" had led shows to break roles into smaller chunks and compress character story lines.
But Hollywood is far from the only industry to have presided over such changes, which reflect a longer-term pattern: the fracturing of work into "many smaller, more degraded, poorly paid jobs," as the labor historian Jason Resnikoff has put it.
In recent decades, the shift has affected highly trained white-collar workers as well. Large law firms have relatively fewer equity partners and more lawyers off the standard partner track, according to data from ALM, the legal media and intelligence company. Universities employ fewer tenured professors as a share of their faculty and more untenured instructors. Large tech companies hire relatively fewer engineers, while raising armies of temps and contractors to test software, label web pages and do low-level programming.
Over time, said Dr. Resnikoff, an assistant professor at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, "you get this tiered work force of prestige workers and lesser workers" -- fewer officers, more grunts. The writers' experience shows how destabilizing that change can be.
The strategy of breaking up complex jobs into simpler, lower-paid tasks has roots in meatpacking and manufacturing. At the turn of the 20th century, automobiles were produced largely in artisanal fashion by small teams of highly skilled "all around" mechanics who helped assemble a variety of components and systems -- ignition, axles, transmission.
By 1914, Ford Motor had repeatedly divided and subdivided these jobs, spreading more than 150 men across a vast assembly line. The workers typically performed a few simple tasks over and over.
For decades, making television shows was similar in some ways to the early days of automaking: A team of writers would be involved in all parts of the production. Many of those who wrote scripts were also on set, and they often helped edit and polish the show into its final form.
The "all around" approach had multiple benefits, writers say. Not least: It improved the quality of the show. "You can write a voice in your head, but if you don't hear it," said Erica Weiss, a co-showrunner of the CBS series "The Red Line," "you don't actually know if it works."
Ms. Weiss said having her writers on the set allowed them to rework lines after the actors' table read, or rewrite a scene if it was suddenly moved indoors.
She and other writers and showrunners said the system also taught young writers how to oversee a show -- essentially grooming apprentices to become the master craftspeople of their day.
But it is increasingly rare for writers to be on set. As in manufacturing, the job of making television shows is being broken down into more discrete tasks.
In most streaming shows, the writers' contracts expire before the filming begins. And even many cable and network shows now seek to separate writing from production.
"It was a good experience, but I didn't get to go to set," said Mae Smith, a writer on the final season of the Showtime series "Billions." "There wasn't money to pay for me to go, even for an established, seven-season show."
Showtime did not respond to a request for comment. Industry analysts point out that studios have felt a growing need to rein in spending amid the decline of traditional television and pressure from investors to focus on profitability over subscriber growth.
In addition to the possible effect on a show's quality, this shift has affected the livelihoods of writers, who end up working fewer weeks a year. Guild data shows that the typical writer on a network series worked 38 weeks during the season that ended last year, versus 24 weeks on a streaming series -- and only 14 weeks if a show had yet to receive a go-ahead. About half of writers now work in streaming, for which almost no original content was made just over a decade ago.
Many have seen their weekly pay dwindle as well. Chris Keyser, a co-chair of the Writers Guild's negotiating committee, said studios had traditionally paid writers well above the minimum weekly rate negotiated by the union as compensation for their role as producers -- that is, for creating a dramatic universe, not just completing narrow assignments.
But as studios have severed writing from production, they have pushed writers' pay closer to the weekly minimum, essentially rolling back compensation for producing. According to the guild, roughly half of writers were paid the weekly minimum rate last year -- about $ 4,000 to $ 4,500 for a junior writer on a show that has received a go-ahead and about $ 7,250 for a more senior writer -- up from one-third in 2014.
Writers also receive residual payments -- a type of royalty -- when an episode they write is reused, as when it is licensed into syndication, but say opportunities for residuals have narrowed because streamers typically don't license or sell their shows. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers said in its statement that the writers' most recent contract had increased residual payments substantially.
(Actors receive residuals, too, and say their pay has suffered in other ways: The streaming era creates longer gaps between seasons, during which regular characters aren't paid but often can't commit to other projects.)
The combination of these changes has upended the writing profession. While the recent television boom has created more jobs -- there are about one-third more Writers Guild members today than a decade ago, and between one and a half and two times as many scripted shows -- the guild says those jobs have been degraded, even as spending on content has escalated.
With writing jobs ending more quickly, even established writers must look for new ones more frequently, throwing them into competition with their less-experienced colleagues. And because more writing jobs pay the minimum, studios have a financial incentive to hire more-established writers over less-established ones, preventing their ascent.
"They can get a highly experienced writer for the same price or just a little more," said Mr. Harper, who considers himself fortunate to have enjoyed success in the industry.
Writers also say studios have found ways to limit the duration of their jobs beyond walling them off from production.
Many junior writers are hired for a writers' room only to be "rolled off" before the room ends, leaving a smaller group to finish the season's scripts, said Bianca Sams, who has worked on shows including the CBS series "Training Day" and the CW program "Charmed."
"If they have to pay you weekly, at a certain point it becomes expensive to keep people," Ms. Sams said. (The wages of junior writers are tied more closely to weeks of work rather than episodes.)
The studios have chafed at writers' description of their work as "gig" jobs, saying that most are guaranteed a certain number of weeks or episodes, and that they receive substantial health and pension benefits.
But many writers fear that the long-term trend is for studios to break up their jobs into ever-smaller pieces that are stitched together by a single showrunner -- the way a project manager might knit together software from the work of a variety of programmers. Some worry that eventually writers may be asked to simply rewrite chatbot-generated drafts.
"I think the endgame is creating material in the cheapest, most piecemeal, automated way possible," said Zayd Dohrn, a Writers Guild member who oversees the screen and stage master's degree program at Northwestern University, "and having one layer of high-level creatives take the cheaply generated material and turn it into something."
He added, "It's the way coders write code -- in the most drone-like way."

Everett I. Mendelsohn, 91, Who Linked Science and Society: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A longtime professor at Harvard, he lectured on atom bombs, genetics and more, examining how science, culture and politics influence one another.
Everett I. Mendelsohn, a Harvard professor who as a scholar of the history of science explored how science's evolution has been influenced by historical and cultural trends and vice versa, died on June 6 at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 91.
His wife, Mary B. Anderson, said the cause was a stroke.
Professor Mendelsohn had a long association with Harvard, beginning in 1953, when he was a graduate student in biology, and continuing for more than half a century. In 1960, he earned a Ph.D. in the history of science at the university and, after a year as a junior fellow, began teaching there. He retired in 2007.
Over that time he lectured on diverse topics -- genetic engineering, the environment, the making of the atomic bomb -- and encouraged students to examine how science had influenced world events and everyday lives.
"Everett was one of a new generation of social historians of science who insisted that it was not enough to pay attention to the internal intellectual story of science," Anne Harrington, the Franklin L. Ford professor of the history of science at Harvard, said by email. "The field needed to attend also to how science was shaped by and also helped shape the conditions of the social world."
She added: "There was a strong ethical dimension to that work, at least for Everett. For years, he taught a course to undergraduates called simply 'Science and Its Social Problems.' Using historical methods to bring into focus some of the ethical challenges and ambiguities of science seems today like an obvious move to make; it was not obvious at the time."
Professor Mendelsohn had a particular interest in the relationship between science and warfare. As a lifelong pacifist, he was active in groups like the American Friends Service Committee and the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Committee on Science, Arms Control and National Security, of which he was a founder. In February 1968, shortly after returning from a monthlong trip to Cambodia, Thailand and South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, he painted a bleak view of the military situation that was at odds with the official American government line.
"I think we are taking a very bad shellacking militarily," he told The Boston Globe, "to the extent that every one of the defenses were pierced, from one end of the country to the other."
In an extensive interview with The Harvard Crimson that same month, he also described the toll the war was taking on civilians, something he saw during a visit to a hospital in Quang Ngai.
"When we went beyond the medical ward into the severe injury ward, you saw the full horror of the war itself," he said.
A group of physicians dispatched to South Vietnam the previous year by President Lyndon B. Johnson had reported finding only a few cases of civilians burned by napalm ("A greater number of burns appeared to be caused by the careless use of gasoline in stoves," the group's report said). But Professor Mendelsohn said he saw dozens of napalm victims at the hospital.
More recently, Professor Mendelsohn had devoted attention to encouraging dialogue that might lead to lasting peace in the Middle East. His family, in a prepared obituary, said that he considered the dearth of progress on that front "his greatest life failure."
Everett Irwin Mendelsohn was born on Oct. 28, 1931, in New York and raised in the Bronx. His father, Morris, was a salesman for a company that imported candy from Europe; his mother, May (Albert) Mendelsohn, was a secretary in the New York City public school system.
After graduating from Brooklyn Technical High School in 1949, Professor Mendelsohn studied both biology and history at Antioch College in Ohio, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in 1953.
In 1955, while doing graduate work at Harvard, he studied for a time at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., where he worked under the biologist Clifford Grobstein on a project that involved extracting hormones from the eye stalks of lobsters. That procedure left the lobster alive and well, and also edible.
"I had lots of friends," Professor Mendelsohn said in a 2013 video interview for an archive devoted to the history of the laboratory, "because they all wanted to come while we had to get rid of the lobsters, which meant cooking them on the beach."
He founded the Journal of the History of Biology in 1968.
"Biology, in particular, must be studied in terms of its relationships with the other sciences and with the intellectual currents of its day," he wrote in an introductory essay in the journal's first issue. "It may be examined as well for its interaction with the institutions of the society which spawns it."
Whichever branch of science he was writing or lecturing about, he was concerned with making sure the subject was not arcane. He told doctoral students that they should be able to go out to Harvard Square and explain their dissertations to people on the street.
In a 2013 lecture at Dartmouth College, he talked about the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, the Industrial Revolution and the recent digital and biological revolutions, and ended by wondering if advances were in danger of becoming so complex that the general public would not be able to understand them or make informed decisions about their applications -- a prospect he did not welcome.
"Scientific revolutions require more fully developed citizen participation, something which is hard, because the knowledge level might be high, and one of the challenges is how you bridge that gap," he said.
He added, "Science, I guess we could say, in some ways, is certainly too important in our lives to be left to experts alone."
Professor Mendelsohn's marriage in 1954 to Mary Maule Leeds ended in divorce. He and Dr. Anderson, an economist and author, married in 1974. In addition to her, he is survived by a sister, Bernice Bronson; three children from his first marriage, Daniel, Sarah and Joanna Mendelsohn; Dr. Anderson's son from a previous marriage, Marshall Wallace; six grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
"In the classroom," Professor Harrington said, "Everett had a gift of gathering together the threads of a discussion, tidying up any incoherences and distilling the deeper insights. 'Let me see if I can pull together what I am hearing here,' he would say. Then he would show students an elevated and elegantly synthesized version of their contributions, so that they would all find themselves amazed and impressed by their own collective thoughtfulness."

Deadly Flash Floods Hit Suburbs of Philadelphia: [National Desk]

Full text: Sudden, torrential rains struck areas in Bucks County, Pa., trapping people in their cars. Much of the Northeast was experiencing periods of heavy rainfall.
Fierce thunderstorms, heavy rainfall and flash flooding wreaked havoc across the Northeast over the weekend, killing five people in Pennsylvania, halting flights at major airports in the New York metropolitan area and downing power lines. In one part of Long Island, five inches of rain fell in less than two hours.
"We are in a very, very unstable weather condition," said that state's governor, Kathy Hochul, as she warned of the dangers of driving under flash flooding conditions. "Your car can go from a place of safety to a place of death."
The worst of the toll was in the suburbs north of Philadelphia, in the area of Washington Crossing -- famous as the location where George Washington crossed the Delaware River in 1776. A raging stream of floodwater trapped 11 cars Saturday evening, sweeping three of them away.
The authorities said a family visiting from Charleston, S.C., encountered the severe flash flooding along Washington Crossing Road, as they headed to a barbecue.
At a news briefing on Sunday, Tim Brewer, the fire chief of nearby Upper Makefield Township, said the family had tried to escape the fierce floodwaters, with the father clutching the 4-year-old son, as the mother and grandmother grabbed the two additional children, who were 9 months and 2 years old.
The father and son made it out safely, he said, but the grandmother, mother and the two children were swept away by the floodwaters.
As of Sunday afternoon, Pennsylvania officials were still searching for the two children, but officials said the mother was among five people confirmed dead. The grandmother survived and was treated at a local hospital.
"We are treating this as a rescue, but we are fairly certain we are in recovery mode at this time," Tim Brewer, the fire chief of Upper Makefield in Bucks County, said of the missing children.
He said an estimated six to seven inches of rain fell in less than 45 minutes. "In my 44 years, I've never seen anything like it," he said. "When the water came up, it came up very swiftly."
Eli Weissman, 65, said he and his 22-year-old daughter were trapped in the same deadly flash flood at Washington Crossing.
They were both on board his BMW motorcycle driving home when it suddenly started raining, he said.
"We were only five miles from my house, so we figured we'd head on home instead of waiting it out," Mr. Weissman said. The rain began to pick up, as cars in front of them started stopping, he said.
"Then this water just came rushing down the road," Mr. Weissman said. "It was like a dam burst or something," he added. "It was just nothing I've ever seen before."
He said he and his daughter were thrown off the bike and into the water, which had swiftly risen to around eight feet deep.
"We were floating down and trying to survive the rapids, you know, feet first, clinging to trees, clinging to vines, anything we could cling to," Mr. Weissman said. "It was so fast and so deep."
Around them, cars were deserted and some of them were overturned. At one point, Mr. Weissman said, he "saw a mother get out of her car with an infant and walk away from the car." He said that he believed that they were members of the family from Charleston, though he was not certain.
The water began to recede after 15 minutes or so, he said, and he and his daughter were finally able to stand again. They carefully made their way to the road and back up to drier land, where his son came to pick them up.
"I've seen flooded roads and I've seen rapid water but never like this," he said.
Collin Mortensen, 17, of Upper Makefield Township, said he was making a food run to Colonial Market when the storm started to peak on Saturday evening.
Driving a Ford Expedition, he said, he passed a car that had slid off the road and down a hill, its front axle broken and a wheel twisted. Then he encountered the flooded road.
"I wasn't sure I was going to make it through," Mr. Mortensen said in an interview at the Shell gasoline station where he was working on Sunday afternoon. When he left the market, he said, emergency crews were blocking off a main intersection, as a river of water headed down a hill and east through the village, toward the river.
Overall, officials said, eight people were rescued in cars in Bucks County, where Washington Crossing is located, and two were rescued from a creek. Saturday's flash flooding in Pennsylvania was followed on Sunday by deluges across the Northeast, with flash flood warnings in effect in parts of Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, Maine and neighboring states. An estimated five inches of rain fell in less than two hours on the east end of Long Island.
Thunderstorms caused flight disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and Kennedy International Airport in New York. In Maryland, officials said that "life-threatening flash flooding" was expected.
In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency Sunday afternoon. "Throughout the state, we have seen heavy rainfalls resulting in hazardous conditions, and we urge residents to remain vigilant around flooded roadways and downed trees and power lines," he said in a statement.
Pennsylvania's governor, Josh Shapiro, said he was "concerned about some additional bad weather coming this evening," and he urged Bucks County residents to remain alert and to avoid flood-hazard areas.
By late afternoon, emergency workers had reopened most of the roads in Bucks County but continued to block the area where they were searching for the missing children. Though most waterways had receded, their levels remained higher than usual, and some roadside culverts were still swollen with swiftly running water.
Michael Adler, a lawyer who lives in Holland, Pa., said it was still raining heavily Sunday afternoon.
"We're getting all these alerts on our phones," he said. "Where we are right now, we're not near creeks, but I know that there are lots of creeks and underground creeks in this area, so everybody's a little concerned."

How the Bidens Treat Hunter's Daughter: [Letter]

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "It's Seven Grandkids, Mr. President," by Maureen Dowd (column, July 9), about her sister's letter to the president urging him to acknowledge a daughter fathered by Hunter Biden:
While I completely agree with Ms. Dowd and her sister that this little girl should be included in the Biden family, I feel the need to add one important reminder. As the mother of an addict (thankfully in recovery, although recovery is never a smooth journey), I know that one should never tell the family of someone who has wrestled with addiction what they "should" do. As in never, ever.
Trust me, the Bidens are in pain on this and so many other issues related to their struggling, courageous, flawed son. Perhaps in time they will make other choices about this precious little girl. But that's part of their journey, and advice written to pressure a family isn't helpful or fair to anyone.
Anne DeCocco
Raleigh, N.C.
To the Editor:
I completely disagree with Maureen Dowd. I welcomed a grandchild when my son was 19 and unmarried. But it was my choice, and if I had turned away for whatever private reason, I would not expect to be publicly condemned for it. Either way, it's a private decision.
Handling this family matter is between the birth parents of the child. It's not a situation for grandparents to overstep. This child, Navy Joan, has a family who loves her. Why should she be forced on one that doesn't?
If it weren't for the White House connection, we all would be more polite about expressing opinions about a child being forced on an 80-year-old grandfather and his family.
S. Donnelly
Cape Cod, Mass.
To the Editor:
I am a staunch supporter of President Biden from both a political and personal perspective. He has made considerable progress on bipartisan legislation and shows personal empathy and deep consideration for all Americans.
But I must applaud Ms. Dowd's column on the surprising tone deafness of the Biden family to their unacknowledged seventh grandchild. No matter the circumstances of her conception, she is a human being who deserves an extended family and who absolutely deserves acknowledgment of her existence.
Mr. Biden should know better than to consign an innocent little girl to a life of rejection and the inability to be embraced by all of her legitimate family. This is definitely not the Joe Biden I admire.
Jane C. Parker
New York
To the Editor:
Nothing has raised my ire more than Maureen Dowd's commentary. Ms. Dowd, Peggy, her sister, and all of us outside the Biden family -- leave them alone. That anyone is casting judgment on what is unequivocally a private matter is just plain wrong. Without walking in someone's shoes, what do we know or truly understand about others' lives?
Empathy, please, not gratuitous meddling.

A Bad Compromise on Serving Gay People
To the Editor:
Re "States Can Still Protect L.G.B.T.Q. Consumers" (Opinion guest essay, July 2):
While I appreciate Aaron Tang's effort to find a compromise that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and protects "the expressive freedom of people of faith," his solution is not a good one.
He proposes that states permit wedding web designers who object to same-sex marriages to farm out to employees or independent contractors any solicitations from gay or lesbian couples. That strategy, he says, would allow businesses to meet public accommodations requirements without forcing the owner or any like-minded employees to create content with which they disagree.
Nothing in current law prohibits an owner from assigning work to employees; if the proprietor of 303 Creative wanted to choose that option, she could. But to direct the customers to an independent contractor is akin to a restaurant that refuses to serve Black people telling the shunned patrons: "Go next door; they'll serve you."
That provides neither the equal access nor the equal dignity that public accommodations law requires.

Finding Support in Faith Communities
To the Editor:
Re "What Churches Offer That 'Nones' Still Long For," by Jessica Grose (newsletter, June 28):
To be sure, many spiritually curious people and spiritual seekers avoid organized religious communities out of an outdated assumption of being judged, criticized or condemned for their beliefs, practices or just being who they are.
Yet word to the contrary is getting out: Many churches, synagogues and other religious institutions are welcoming and affirming of multiracial, interfaith, uncertain, and L.G.B.T.Q.+ individuals and households.
There is a rebound of interest and activity in faith communities, post-Covid isolation, brought on by a new appreciation for what a safe and supportive congregation can provide. As one parent of young children said to me, "We need to be with each other, as if we are turning to the temple to make up for lost time during the pandemic."
I hope that more people see their local house of worship as an opportunity to kindle and enter new, nurturing and positive relationships in a spiritual community.

Indiana Jones and 'the Magic of Movies'
To the Editor:
Re "Unwrinkled or Not, Forever Battling the Nazis" (review, June 30):
"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny" isn't just a movie -- it's a time capsule. You open it up and you discover the magic of movies all over again.
There you are in a dark theater, among strangers, digging into your popcorn, your eyes transfixed on the action on the screen. There's Indiana Jones! And he's not just alive and well, but he's thriving! Crisscrossing the globe from New York to Morocco to Sicily. In search of the most elusive treasure of all!
Suddenly, you're a kid again, you're Jones's new 13-year-old sidekick, integral to the outcome of the story, finding your way in forbidden Italian caves, armed with your instincts and guile, and a newfound knowledge of Archimedes.
Who knows, maybe you'll become the next great archaeologist, maybe there's still time. You walk out of that theater and into the humid July night having been on the wildest ride you've ever been on, one you'll never forget. The summer's still ahead of you, and you wonder what other adventures await.
Thank you, Harrison Ford and James Mangold, the director, for giving us this treasure of a movie. May we protect it and the moviegoing experience for years to come.
Andrew Sherman

Ron DeSantis and Goofy
To the Editor:
"Disney Fears Broadsides as DeSantis Campaigns" (Business, July 4):
If Disney wants to defang Ron DeSantis, it should do what it does best: communicate. I see a short cartoon. Goofy is sitting, reading a newspaper. He looks up and says, "I see DeSantis has said [pick out four or five of the nuttiest things DeSantis has said]."
Goofy makes a face and says, "And they say I'm goofy."

The Modern Farmhouse Is Here to Stay: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: In a divided country, a clean look and a neutral color palette is the aesthetic comforting communities around the country.
Drive through any American suburb and odds are you'll spot a modern farmhouse in its natural habitat. The style is hard to miss: white board and batten vertical siding, large black frame windows, and gables. A covered porch, with a swing or maybe Adirondack chairs. A tin roof. And of course, house numbers in sans serif font.
Love it or hate it, the modern farmhouse is the millennial answer to the baby boomer McMansion.
This post-agrarian look is the defining style of the current era -- dominating renovations, new construction and subdivisions in communities with no connection to farming, with interiors that have open concept floor plans, wide plank wood floors, plenty of shiplap, and kitchens with apron sinks and floating shelves made of reclaimed wood. Even multifamily homes are getting the modern farmhouse treatment, falling into the barndominium category, as they embrace vertical siding, gables and tin roofs, giving a folksy nod to apartment complexes.
In May, the wallpaper designer Hovia declared modern farmhouse the most popular interior design style in the country, a sentiment echoed by architects, designers and home builders who say they regularly field requests from clients eager for a clean look with a neutral color palette that manages to feel both traditional and contemporary.
"When it comes down to it, those are very classic materials," said Leanne Ford, an interior designer who has hosted two HGTV shows with her brother and is known for her affinity for white on white. "The porch, the board and batten, the swing, those are all beautiful things that have stood the test of time and are still stunning. Those are going to live a long and happy life and still be beautiful in 5 or 10 or 20 years."
Toss all those elements together and you have an aesthetic that is seemingly everywhere, as homes of all stripes -- a split-level ranch, a four square, a craftsman bungalow -- routinely get the modern farmhouse treatment.
In 2020, when Lauren and Jeffrey Sachs decided it was time to leave Manhattan for the suburbs, they landed on a 4,500-square-foot modern farmhouse on a leafy street of colonial revivals in Verona, N.J. In its previous life, the house had been a modest, two-bedroom cape with cedar shingles and black shutters. But the previous owners had torn the house down, leaving only a single wall, and reinvented it as an archetype of modern farmhouse design.
"I knew exactly what I wanted," said Sonia Sun, 48, the previous owner who steered the two-year renovation, plucking ideas from Google searches and design magazines. "I wanted something that would mesh with the neighborhood."
But by the time the work was done and the house was livable, her children had "meshed" in the town where they were living while they remodeled, and so they stayed in Morris County, in a six-bedroom colonial craftsman style home. If she ever gave the house an update, she would give it the modern farmhouse treatment. "Definitely Studio McGee, 100 percent," she said, referring to the popular design studio. "I love her and Joanna Gaines, baby."
The Gaines Effect
Modern farmhouse, a contemporary style that bears a passing resemblance to a traditional farmhouse, first entered the American lexicon a decade ago on "Fixer Upper," the HGTV sensation that catapulted the hosts, Chip and Joanna Gaines, onto the national stage, and persuaded homeowners to decorate their walls with enormous clocks and word art proclaiming the banal -- Family! Eat! Coffee!
The Gaineses turned Waco, Texas, into an unlikely design destination as the city's old farmhouses were wrestled into the modern era, busy floral wallpaper stripped away to reveal virgin shiplap, the lowly building material reinvented as the main attraction.
It didn't take long for the style to overtake contemporary homes and consume Instagram feeds as kitchens bathed in white shaker cabinets and heavily veined countertops became standard. The look evolved, led by a new generation of celebrity designers with their own renovation shows and home furnishing lines, like Shea McGee of Studio McGee, who whitewashed brick and embraced blond, beige and wicker. While many designers and design critics predicted the look would have peaked by now, its staying power proves we're a long way from the summit.
Pottery Barn Kids advertises a modern farmhouse crib, on sale for $ 600, and Home Depot sells a modern farmhouse outdoor playhouse for $ 299. At Jessica Cloe Miniatures, the $ 450 six-room modern farmhouse dollhouse kit with board and batten siding is sold out, but you can still buy plenty of rustic side tables, soaker tubs and wooden trays writ small. Even Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian channeled the vibe for the exteriors of the side-by-side mansions they built in the Santa Monica mountains.
The National Association of Home Builders does not track the popularity of the style. But Deryl Patterson, the president of Housing Design Matters, which designs homes for builders, says the look accounts for more than a quarter of her company's work. "If a builder says, 'I need three elevations,' one will always be modern farmhouse," she said.
Mark Canale, a home builder outside Philadelphia, and a developer of a nine-house subdivision of modern farmhouses, heeded the advice of local real estate agents who told him that the demand was insatiable. "You have to build what satisfies everybody," he said, estimating that the appetite is large enough that, with enough land, he could sell three times as many homes in the same motif.
Ms. Sachs, 32, a stay-at-home mother, and Mr. Sachs, 36, who owns a commercial finance business, doubled down on modern farmhouse soon after they moved into the $ 1.351 million home. They added a brick walkway and cedar posts and beams on the porch. They replaced the garage doors with carriage-style ones. After spotting a tin roof on a cottage in the Hamptons, Ms. Sachs installed one on her house. "Honestly, I just thought it was fancy," she said, leaning against the leathered granite island in her kitchen one sunny afternoon. For Ms. Sachs, midcentury modern feels too cold, and the Italianate style she grew up with felt too ornate and uncomfortable. By contrast, modern farmhouse feels like home. "I feel like it's very evergreen," she said. "It's never really going to go out of style."
'Fetishism for Folksiness'
Fans of the style often describe it as classic and timeless, but the architecture and design critic Alexandra Lange begs to differ. "It's basically modernism in drag," she said of a style that manages to hide modernist elements -- big open windows and open floor plans -- behind creature comforts like gables and covered porches. Americans are drawn to the look, she said, because it has all the trappings of modernism without actually looking particularly modern. "Americans aren't really comfortable buying modern houses," she said. "That is a rich person's architecture."
Thomas Mellins, an architectural historian and a curator of the "House & Home" exhibition at National Building Museum, finds it fitting that Americans, who gravitate to styles that reflect larger cultural trends, chose this moment to land on a look that makes you think of "Little House on the Prairie," but only if the Ingalls family lived in the suburbs and worked in finance.
Consider the McMansion, the ultimate ode to excess, often derided for ill-conceived turrets, arches, columns and gables. The style dominated the early 2000s, as Americans embarked on a house spending spree fueled by reckless lending practices from banks doling out subprime mortgages. When the market came to a crash in 2008, the McMansion came down with it. The split-level ranch had a postwar heyday when Americans were so enamored with their cars they found a way to bring them inside.
And Americans' on-again off-again love affair with colonial revival rears its head during periods of heightened nationalism, like in the 1920s. "Immigration is cut off in 1921 and in 1924 and that is the moment colonial revival gets really popular again," said Mr. Mellins, an adjunct associate professor at the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. "There is a dark side to that. One could see a kind of xenophobia and a fear of the other and so you want to express your Americanness."
Now, at a moment when populism has taken hold amid deep political divisions, the style of the day is one that imagines a romanticized and fantastical agrarian past -- a real farmhouse doesn't have a walk-in shower with a waterfall showerhead or a sliding barn door to hide a well-appointed laundry room with a weathered placard that says "wash and dry." As the country grapples with existential questions about its identity and its future, the house of choice makes you think about spinning wool into yarn.
"There is an American fetishism for folksiness and rural life, and there is a longing for rural life that comes into the modern farmhouse," said Kate Wagner, the creator of the McMansion Hell blog. "It is alienating living in an exurb when the only thing you encounter is a huge strip mall. You have to make up for this barren, alienating landscape by devising some kind of homeliness in your house."
Ari Katz and Shari Sperling were so inspired by country life that they decided to bring it to their tightly-packed suburban neighborhood of split-level ranches in West Orange, N.J., a five-minute drive from the Sachses' house. "If I wasn't Jewish, I would probably be living in Montana," said Mr. Katz, who is orthodox and so lives within walking distance of his synagogue. "So I'm trying to bring Montana here, I'm trying to do our part to bring the West here. That was really our whole goal with this house."
Mr. Katz, 42, and Dr. Sperling, 43, spent half of 2021 and about $ 750,000 renovating their split-level ranch, adding another floor and giving the exterior the full modern farmhouse treatment, replete with white board and batten siding, black frame windows, a stone foundation and four wooden columns made of western redcedar, the official tree of British Columbia. The couple recently sold their dermatology practice where Dr. Sperling is a dermatologist and Mr. Katz is the general manager.
Sit on a black Adirondack chair on the front porch and the smell of fresh cedar is inescapable. When the wood first arrived from Canada, "it literally smelled like a national park," said Mr. Katz, gazing out at the elementary school across the street on a drizzly morning. During the long construction period, Mr. Katz happened upon a cast iron bison at an antique shop in Manhattan. He bought it, named it Monty and it now sits on the porch, too.
'The People Against Modern Farmhouse'
Modern Farmhouse is not without its critics. Among them is Kathryn Grabowski-Khairullah, who, in 2021, bought her first home outside Detroit and was soon bombarded with rustic décor options as she tried to decorate. "At first I fell victim to some of it," she said. "There was a lot of pressure to change everything and conform everything into this style because it was all I was seeing."
It didn't take long for Ms. Grabowski-Khairullah, 34, who works in arts administration, to rebel against what she saw as home décor's answer to fast fashion -- a style that felt cheap, redundant and soulless. "Everything was devoid of color," she said. "Everybody had to have white shaker cabinets, everybody had to have white subway tile and only white subway tile, everybody had to have a giant hood over their stove."
Looking for a place to commiserate, she started a Facebook group, "The People Against Modern Farmhouse," which soon amassed 165,000 members who post memes and photographs ripe for ridicule. "Most of us in the group have been waiting for it to go away," said Ms. Grabowski-Khairullah, who finally landed on her own aesthetic, a sort of "Golden Girls" revivalism. "It's just so kitschy that it's ridiculous," she said of her 1980s furnishings that she plucked mostly from Facebook Marketplace. "Everything is seashells and bows and pink."
But for modern farmhouse devotees, the minimalist palette is the point. "I'm not a huge color person, you're not going to see a lot of color in my house," said Jeniffer Diaz, who has spent three years stripping the oranges, pinks and browns from her ranch-style house in Palmetto Bay, a Miami suburb. "That's my vibe."
The house, from 1977, had vaulted ceilings with wood beams and tan tile floors when she bought it. Ms. Diaz, 31, a stay-at-home mother, and Manny Diaz, 30, who owns a trucking company, spent about $ 200,000 renovating the house they bought in 2020 for $ 560,000. They replaced the tan, green and stone facade with white stucco and concrete board siding and replaced the shingle roof with a metal one.
Inside, they painted the wood-slatted ceiling white and the beams black. They gut renovated the bathrooms, swapping out a pink vanity with scalloped sinks for a white one with brass hardware. The kitchen now has black cabinets, white appliances and open wood shelves. "Pinterest is my best friend," Ms. Diaz said.
The result is a house that may hail from the midcentury, but when you step inside, you'll know immediately that you are in the home of the moment.

(PHOTOGRAPH BY LISA PETROLE/MAGNOLIA NETWORK, VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS); Colonial revival has come in and out of fashion since the 1880s. Americans turn to it during periods of heightened nationalism, like in the 1920s when the federal government curtailed immigration. At these moments, the country looks nostalgically at the colonial style of pre-revolutionary America and reimagines it.; Americans embraced modern architecture, building homes with larger rooms and cleaner lines, in postwar America. They were also falling in love with their cars. Cue the split-level ranch, a style that so thoroughly embraces car culture that it manages to bring the beloved automobile into the house.; The McMansion first appeared in American suburbs in the 1980s, filling subdivisions with supersized, poorly constructed, convoluted homes. The style had its heyday in the early 2000s, at a time when banks were doling out subprime mortgages, fueling an overheated housing market that collapsed in 2008.

The Rich Are Crazier Than You and Me: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a crank. His views are a mishmash of right-wing fantasies mixed with remnants of the progressive he once was: Bitcoin boosterism, anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, assertions that Prozac causes mass shootings, opposition to U.S. support for Ukraine, but also favorable mention for single-payer health care. But for his last name, nobody would be paying him any attention -- and despite that last name, he has zero chance of winning the Democratic presidential nomination.
Yet now that Ron DeSantis's campaign (slogan: "woke woke immigrants woke woke") seems to be on the skids, Kennedy is suddenly getting support from some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley. Jack Dorsey, who founded Twitter, has endorsed him, while some other prominent tech figures have been holding fund-raisers on his behalf. Elon Musk, who is in the process of destroying what Dorsey built, hosted him for a Twitter spaces event.
So what does all this tell us about the role of technology billionaires in modern American political life? The other day I wrote about how a number of tech bros have become recession and inflation truthers, insisting that the improving economic news is fake. (I neglected to mention Dorsey's 2021 declaration that hyperinflation was "happening." How's that going?) What the Silicon Valley Kennedy boomlet shows is that this is actually part of a broader phenomenon.
What seems to attract some technology types to R.F.K. Jr. is his contrarianism -- his disregard for conventional wisdom and expert opinion. So before I get into the tech-bro specific aspects of this weird political moment, let me say a few things about being contrarian.
One sad but true fact of life is that most of the time conventional wisdom and expert opinion are right; yet there can be big personal and social payoffs to finding the places where they're wrong. The trick to achieving these payoffs is to balance on the knife edge between excessive skepticism of unorthodoxy and excessive credulity.
It's all too easy to fall off that knife's edge in either direction. When I was a young, ambitious academic I used to make fun of stodgy older economists whose reaction to any new idea was "It's trivial, it's wrong and I said it in 1962." These days I sometimes worry that I've turned into that guy.
On the other hand, reflexive contrarianism is, as the economist Adam Ozimek puts it, a "brain rotting drug." Those who succumb to that drug "lose the ability to judge others they consider contrarian, become unable to tell good evidence from bad, a total unanchoring of belief that leads them to cling to low quality contrarian fads."
Tech bros appear to be especially susceptible to brain-rotting contrarianism. As I wrote in my newsletter, their financial success all too often convinces them that they're uniquely brilliant, able to instantly master any subject, without any need to consult people who've actually worked hard to understand the issues. And in many cases they became wealthy by defying conventional wisdom, which predisposes them to believe that such defiance is justified across the board.
Add to this the fact that great wealth makes it all too easy to surround yourself with people who tell you what you want to hear, validating your belief in your own brilliance -- a sort of intellectual version of the emperor's new clothes.
And to the extent that contrarian tech bros talk to anyone else, it's to one another. The tech entrepreneur and writer Anil Dash tells us that "it's impossible to overstate the degree to which many big tech C.E.O.s and venture capitalists are being radicalized by living within their own cultural and social bubble." He calls this phenomenon of venture capitalism "VC QAnon," a concept that I find helps explain many of the strange positions taken by tech billionaires lately.
Let me add a personal speculation. It may seem odd to see men of vast wealth and influence buying into conspiracy theories about elites running the world. Aren't they the elites? But I suspect that famous, wealthy men may be especially frustrated by their inability to control events, or even stop people from ridiculing them on the internet. So rather than accepting that the world is a complicated place nobody can control, they're susceptible to the idea that there are secret cabals out to get them.
There's historical precedent here. Watching Elon Musk's descent, I know that I'm not alone in thinking of Henry Ford, who remains in many ways the ultimate example of a famous, influential entrepreneur, and who also became a rabid, conspiracy-theorizing anti-Semite. He even paid for a reprinting of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a forgery that was probably promoted by the Russian secret police. (Time is a flat circle.)
In any case, what we're seeing now is something remarkable. Arguably, the craziest faction in U.S. politics right now isn't red-hatted blue-collar guys in diners, it's technology billionaires living in huge mansions and flying around on private jets. At one level it's quite funny. Unfortunately, however, these people have enough money to do serious damage.

Secrets to an Excellent Sandwich: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: In search of the perfect, flavor-layered bite, sandwich shops are focusing on restraint, approaching every element with a high level of care.
Carefully considered and seasoned, each layer of the Surfer, a turkey sandwich Matt Cahn serves at his Middle Child in the heart of Philadelphia, locks into place. The melty Swiss cheese, the spiced blueberry chutney, the vinaigrette-dressed arugula and the housemade deli turkey sit atop a thick smear of Duke's mayonnaise inside a toasted ciabatta roll. The sandwich has nary a dry bit, and the precision of flavors is illuminating.
Recipe: Turkey Sandwich With Savory Blueberry Jam
Anything that good takes refining. The idea began with a smoked turkey and Brie panini smeared with blueberry jam from a sandwich shop in Maine, where Mr. Cahn spent summers with an old girlfriend. He slowly fine-tuned his own version for surfing trips over the years, even making his own jam from wild blueberries he picked from the backyard.
The relationship didn't last, but the memories of that time live on as one of the most popular items at Middle Child, the bustling modern sandwich shop he opened in 2017. It's not always easy to serve something that makes customers return, but dozens of people -- old, young and hungry -- line up every day to order the blueberry-slicked sandwich.
Well-constructed creations like Mr. Cahn's embrace an often-overlooked component of sandwich-making: restraint. Put another way, the sought-after sandwiches of today focus any maximalism on finesse and flavor. Of course, thoughtful, well-made sandwiches are nothing new: In New York alone, Court Street Grocers and the shuttered No. 7 Sub and Saltie come to mind. But, now, they're especially stellar -- and easy to come by.
In the roast pork hoagie at Palm City in San Francisco, fried provolone crisps provide crunch among the otherwise soft, meaty textures. A blanket of arugula replaces iceberg lettuce in their take on the Italian hoagie, their most popular sandwich. And for a vegetarian option, a growing genre of sandwiches, a spice blend with tingling Sichuan peppercorns adds intrigue to roasted cauliflower, avocado and pickled vegetables.
In 2020, Dennis Cantwell and Monica Wong did not plan to open Palm City as a hoagie deli. But when the pandemic curbed their initial vision of a mom-and-pop restaurant with "small bites and fun wines," they had to pivot. With the help of a friend, the chef and Philadelphia native Melissa McGrath, the couple scrapped their plans, partnered with a local bakery and started slinging sandwiches.
What was intended to be a temporary arrangement took off at a time when to-go food was a necessity of quarantine life. "There was something sentimental about a little taste of somewhere else," said Mr. Cantwell, reflecting on why Philadelphia hoagies were such a success in San Francisco. "They made people happy."
Sandwiches, they learned, are good business. Mr. Cantwell and Ms. Wong are looking into opening a second location.
At this crop of new sandwich shops, be careful not to mistake curation for limitedness. Precision is often a sign of good eats to come.
At the Bake Shop & Cafe in Cleveland, which opened in 2021, the bread options are as calibrated as the fillings. Care for a curry chicken sandwich, or a turkey club? You can enjoy either on a croissant, baguette or pain de mie. Housemade naan, a customer favorite, can envelop grilled vegetables, if you'd like. But the best option might be the biscuit.
After quitting her job in Tallahassee, Fla., Shawnda Moye moved back home to Ohio and found it difficult to find a good breakfast sandwich, let alone real Southern biscuits. She joked about her "walk of shame" out of a McDonald's or a Burger King, biscuit sandwich in hand.
To fill the gap, she started the Roaming Biscuit in 2019, a pop-up with a focus on breakfast sandwiches. Her success led her to open the Bake Shop & Cafe in Cleveland's Tyler Village, where she sells the Roaming Biscuit lineup.
Restraint is especially important in a biscuit sandwich. Too much of anything, and the biscuit disintegrates. The scrambled egg should be light and fluffy, the cheese melted enough to bind, and the bacon sturdy, for structure: thick-cut, and not "the skinny stuff," Ms. Moye said.
Her most popular biscuit sandwich is a special: smoked brisket, egg and cheese. Customers "get upset when we don't have it," she said. A mustard sauce amps up the intrigue. That's how a guest star becomes a series regular. (Starting Sunday, the sandwich becomes a permanent menu item at the Roaming Biscuit's new location in the Hingetown neighborhood.)
If there's one lesson to glean from these sandwich shops, it's that you should refine your own sandwiches at home, too. That often means pulling back, omitting ingredients to make room for the unexpected.
Take, for example, a tuna salad sandwich. You could load up a can of tuna with the usual cavalcade of ingredients (onion, citrus, herbs), but relying on a smaller set of more potent additions can really make it shimmer.
Recipe: Pepperoncini Tuna Salad
Acid and crunch can come in the form of delightfully sour, salty pickled pepperoncini and its neon-green brine. Sweet relish can lend balance, and nutty, toasted sesame oil can round things out like the double bass in an orchestra.
Served inside a split buttery croissant that's been just warmed through in a toaster oven, this pared-down tuna salad will taste like a million ingredients -- abundance in restraint.

Hide It or Flaunt It: Two Sides of a Gold Coin: [Style Desk]

Full text: So does the pop culture and fashion wheel turn.
And just like that, stealth wealth, the aesthetic made viral by "Succession," with its toxic billionaires in their Loro Piana baseball caps and Tom Ford hoodies locked in a C-suite cage match to the death, has been swept off screen.
In its place: logomania, branding that can be seen from whole city blocks away and accessories that jangle and gleam with the blinding light of bragging rights.
The outfits, that is to say, of Carrie and Co. in Season 2 of "And Just Like That ...," the "Sex and the City" reboot come recently to Max -- the streamer that, as it happens, also gave us the Roys in their greige cashmere. Both shows are set in New York City, the home of strivers and entrepreneurs, of "Washington Square" and Wharton, of constantly evolving social castes highly, and literally, invested in their own identifiable camouflage.
If watching "Succession" was in part like engaging in a detective game to suss out what character was wearing what brand, so insider were the fashion politics, watching "And Just Like That ..." is like attending brandapalooza: the double Cs and Fs and Gs practically whacking you on the head with their presence. (Warning: Spoilers are coming.) All the over-the-top fashionista-ing is back. The room-size closets!
It's the yin to the "Succession" yang: a veritable celebration of the comforting aspirational dreams of self-realization (or self-escapism) embedded in stuff that may actually be the most striking part of an increasingly stale series. Certainly, the clothes, which often serve as their own plot points, are more memorable than any dialogue.
Well ... except maybe for that instantly classic line in Episode 1, uttered by Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) on her way to the Met Gala in reference to her gown and feather hat: "It's not crazy -- it's Valentino." But that's the exception that proves the rule.
There is Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), with her multiple Manolos and Fendis, self-medicating with shopping, returning home one day with six Bergdorf Goodman bags. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) toting her Burberry doggy poop bag (also possessed of a Burberry apron and Burberry ear muffs) and bemoaning the fact that her teenage daughter hocked her Chanel dress to fund her musical aspirations.
Lisa Todd Wexley dropping her kids off for camp in a bright green Louis Vuitton jacket and scarf. And Seema (Sarita Choudhury), the character that passes for a restrained dresser thanks to her penchant for neutrals (and the occasional animal print), loudly lamenting the theft of her caramel-colored Hermès Birkin -- one of her totems of self, ripped directly from her hands.
There is Loewe and Pierre Cardin; Altuzarra and Dries Van Noten. There is also an effort to repurpose clothes, like Carrie's wedding dress, in order to promote the virtues of rewearing, but it's pretty much lost in all the rest of the muchness. There is a dedicated Instagram account on which the costume designers Molly Rogers and Danny Santiago share their finds, with 277,000 followers. @Successionfashion, by contrast, has 184,000.
All of which means what, exactly? Is the era of quiet luxury, so recently embraced by TikTok, already at an end? Have our attention spans, so famously abbreviated, moved on? Has the physics of fashion exerted its force and produced an equal and opposite reaction to an earlier action?
As if. In many ways, the fashion in "And Just Like That ..." seems to protest too much. In part that's because it seems like a regurgitation of the fun that came before, which was itself a reaction to the minimalism of the early 1990s, which itself was born in that decade's recession.
The fact is, no matter how much lip service has been paid to quiet luxury or stealth wealth or whatever you want to call it, and how it is 2023's "hottest new fashion trend," it was never a recent invention. It has been around since way back when it was referred to as "shabby chic" or "connoisseurship" or "old money," all synonyms for the kind of product that didn't look overtly expensive but was a sign of aesthetic genealogy -- the difference between new money and inherited money that fashion co-opted and regurgitated to its own ends. Just as more obviously coded consumption has been around since Louis Vuitton plunked his initials on some leather back in 1896 or since Jay Gatsby started tossing his shirts.
We've been declaring the "end of logos" and, alternately, the "rise of stealth wealth" for decades now. There are cycles when one is more ubiquitous than the other (usually having to do with economic downturns when flaunting disposable income is not a great look), but they exist in tandem. They help define each other.
Consider that during the current economic uncertainty, exactly the kind of environment that tends to fast-forward the appeal of low-key high-cost items, the most successful global brands have remained the most highly identifiable: Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Hermès. Or that in his recent debut for Louis Vuitton, Pharrell Williams introduced a bag called Millionaire that costs -- yup -- $ 1 million. (It's a yellow croc Speedy with gold and diamond hardware.)
What is more interesting is, as Carrie and the gang continue on their merry wardrobed way, how clichéd both styles now seem, how performative. Once they have trickled up to television, it's impossible not to recognize the costume. Or the fact that whichever look you buy into, they are simply different ways of expressing wealth, in all its decorative strata. And wealth itself never goes out of fashion.

Coming Back for Seconds: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: The buffet got creamed during the pandemic. Even when diners crept back into restaurants covered in hand sanitizer, a model of eating based on shared serving spoons and food seasoned with the breath of strangers seemed like a goner.
But the all-you-can-eat buffet, that symbol of America's love of choice and penchant for excess, will not be denied. From piles of crab legs at swank Las Vegas casinos to pans of fried chicken in small-town Southern restaurants, the buffet is back, baby.
"The media called buffets zombie companies -- we didn't know we were dead," said Lance Trenary, the chief executive of Golden Corral, whose 360 restaurants offer unlimited helpings of 150 different items for less than $ 20. "But we're the comeback kids. Year to date, we're running about 20 percent up."
At a time when inflation has driven up the cost of both groceries and restaurant meals, the renewed popularity of an inexpensive chain-restaurant buffet could be explained as a value proposition. But at the most lavish spreads in Las Vegas, where dinner can cost $ 79.99 before cocktails and tax, reservations remain hard to come by and waits can stretch to more than two hours.
Demand is so strong that Bellagio last month reopened its signature buffet for dinner, with 120 choices. The Bacchanal buffet at Caesars Palace, the largest in Las Vegas, recently got a nearly $ 10 million face-lift and added two extra days to its brunch schedule.
"Americans love big things. That's it," said Allison Corona, a data analyst from Pittsburgh whose recent five-day trip to Las Vegas with her husband and friends included four buffets. "We just love more. I'm not saying that's good. I'm just saying it's who we are."
Buffets speak to an American dining culture that prizes consistency, value and choice. They can make people of modest means feel rich, if just for an hour or two. They provide culinary road maps for recent immigrants and culinary tourism for those who haven't traveled much. A buffet can be as communal as a church picnic.
Buffets also cater to that secret place within the American diner that just wants to pile it on -- despite attempts to rebrand "all you can eat" as the more genteel "all you care to eat."
Lilly Jan, a food and beverage management lecturer at Cornell University's school of hotel administration, calls it the Cheesecake Factory effect.
"Americans want the consistency because they are afraid to take risks with their dollars as relates to food," she said. "They want to go somewhere with the kids where everyone can have what they want and it doesn't break the bank, but they want to make it an experience."
Still, the buffet landscape has been reshaped by the turmoil of the past few years. For one thing, the underbrush has been cleaned out.
Middle-of-the-pack buffets that didn't offer either great value or a big culinary payoff never returned. Fresh Acquisitions, the company that owned Hometown Buffet and three other chains, filed for bankruptcy in 2021, citing concerns that some restaurants couldn't reach the 75 percent capacity needed to begin to turn a profit on all-you-can-eat meals.
This is also the final chapter for the cheap Las Vegas buffet, which started in the 1940s as a way to keep gamblers from leaving casinos. On the Strip, where 18 buffets once stood, only eight remain, according to casino.org.
Before the pandemic, Sheri Orner managed buffets for Station Casinos, an inexpensive local favorite. "I was budgeted to lose money every month," she said. The company never reopened its buffets after the shutdown.
Ms. Orner began working as general manager of Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan a year after it reopened in June 2020. On a busy day it serves 1,800 diners, at $ 49 a head ( $ 74 if you add unlimited alcohol).
On a recent Saturday, the wait to enter her world of bottomless mimosas, steamed crab legs and custom-made omelets was almost two hours. But the young, diverse crowd wanted more than the greatest hits.
"The buffet is designed so the TikTokers and the Instagrammers can make their pretty pictures of the food," Ms. Orner said.
Although many tables at Las Vegas buffets are covered in almost nothing but crab, plenty hold food that would never have appeared at Frank Sinatra's buffet. Korean-spiced chicken wings were nestled in individual fryer baskets. Horchata was purple with ube. Birria tacos came hot off a grill, and steaming bowls of black garlic ramen were made to order.
Of course, there are still the showstoppers. The line for fresh crepes at the Bellagio was long, and people queued up for chilled lobster claws and three kinds of crab at Bacchanal, where putting out 4,000 pounds of steamed snow crab and carving 600 pounds of prime rib per day is not unusual.
The people who manage buffets, both grand and modest, are taking a harder look at balancing food costs and abundance, and are working to minimize food waste, the ugly underbelly of the buffet.
One helpful strategy is plating foods in individual portions, like single servings of roasted bone marrow or small bites of tuna poke, said Nathan Frost, the executive chef at the Bellagio. Increased kitchen efficiencies and new technology help chefs to more precisely track what, when and how much customers eat.
At the end of each day, the Bellagio staff packages some items that haven't been put on the buffet into aluminum pans and freezes them for Three Square, a food bank that works with 160 agencies in southern Nevada.
"It's beautiful food," said Maurice Johnson, the food bank's director of operations.
The pandemic break allowed buffets to spruce up, whether a multimillion-dollar renovation at Bacchanal or new hand sanitizer stations at Golden Corral. It's a relief for diners who are newly vigilant about food safety and their own health.
"A year ago we wouldn't have done this," said Djuana Jordan, who was eating a $ 16.99 dinner at a Golden Corral near Atlanta with her husband and two children. They were on their way home to Chattanooga, Tenn., after picking up their teenage daughter at a Florida softball camp. No one could agree on what to eat, so they stopped at the buffet.
"It's sort of a step forward for us post-Covid," Ms. Jordan said.
Even buffet skeptics like Faith Fisher Einhorn, a real estate agent who splits her time between New York City and Boca Raton, Fla., have embraced the big spread.
"If you knew me, you would know I would not be inclined to go to a buffet," she said. The hot bars and salad bars that dot Manhattan? "I would rather die."
But when in Boca Raton, she can't wait to visit the elaborate buffet at St. Andrews Country Club, one of several in the area that serve the residential communities around them.
"I feel like it's well-maintained, and food isn't sitting out for 60 years," she said. She texted a photo of the Christmas buffet, which she described as "a football field's worth of food."
For Gen Xers and older millennials who grew up during the golden age of Chinese buffets and national chains like Sizzler and Pizza Hut, the buffet is also a nostalgia play.
Choo Choo Hu, 34, a professional pianist in Atlanta who immigrated from China as a child, builds her travel around food. But she recalls with great fondness and detail her favorite dishes at the Old Country Buffet in St. Louis, where her parents would take her and her sister when the family had something to celebrate, like the day they got their green cards.
"It felt like we were being as American as we could be," she said.
Dr. Jan, the hospitality consultant, grew up in a Taiwanese American family that frequented expansive Asian buffets in Flushing, Queens. Before the family walked through the door, her dad would offer a warning echoed by many parents who view teaching a child to beat the house at the buffet an important life lesson: "No noodles and no rice."
"When it comes to cultures with food insecurities embedded into narratives and folklore," she said, "there's a lot of value in gaming the system. But also it's about the experience."
In smaller cities and towns in the South, the buffet is as much about community as it is about endless trays of fried chicken and squash casserole.
The Movie Star Restaurant, a $ 15.99 all-you-can-eat buffet in Hattiesburg, Miss., is named after the lingerie factory that occupied the building of its original location. This past March was its strongest month of sales since the restaurant opened in 2000.
"The pandemic didn't kill the buffet, it just made it stronger," said Lori Ford, whose parents founded the restaurant. "I think not having it for so long made people appreciate it more."
But then again, it might just be the power of a buffet.
"People and their food," she said. "They don't like to be told what they can and can't have."

A Path to Preserving Growth and Planet: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Economic growth is often seen as incompatible with conservation. It doesn't have to be that way, economists say.
Preserve nature, or accelerate economic growth? It's long seemed as if nations had to choose between the two. And we all know how that choice usually plays out: Our desire to accumulate wealth and our need to lift people out of poverty have pushed Earth to the brink.
But we can do a better job of balancing that trade-off.
Researchers at the World Bank think they have found a way, and today we want to explain how. It's all about farming more intensively and in appropriate places, while preserving larger areas of forest and other habitat that stash that planet-warming carbon and support biodiversity.
"Suppose you were to use all the resources that you have efficiently and properly, and allocate those resources efficiently and properly. How much could you produce?" said Richard Damania, chief economist at the bank's sustainable development practice group. "We come up with some shockingly large numbers."
In a report issued today, Damania's team, in collaboration with the Natural Capital Project, a partnership of groups focused on quantifying the value of ecosystems, has drawn a new road map for countries to achieve that. It gets to the heart of the World Bank's challenge as its new leader, Ajay Banga, seeks to bend the institution's considerable capital toward curbing climate change and averting mass extinctions.
Of course, getting there would be no easy feat. It would require sweeping reallocations of land and the widespread adoption of advanced farming practices.
But there is a pathway.
The best of all possible worlds.
Humanity needs to protect and reclaim millions more acres of land to counteract greenhouse gas emissions, but politicians also want to raise standards of living for their citizens -- something that often involves destructive forms of farming and ranching that gobble up vulnerable ecosystems.
But the bank's researchers found that countries could do much better.
They estimated that countries could sequester 85.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, the equivalent to two years' worth of global emissions at current rates, without denting economic growth. Alternatively, they could increase annual income from forestry and agriculture by $ 329 billion per year, which could meet the world's food needs until 2050, without damaging the environment.
In many cases, preserving land and water does double duty, contributing to the economy and helping nature at the same time. Take an example from New York City: Its water comes from a forested watershed in the Catskill Mountains that costs about $ 167 million a year to maintain. Without it, the city would need to spend $ 6 billion to build filtration plants that would then cost $ 250 million per year to maintain.
How to get more from farming.
The bank's research team has created detailed maps that show which areas would need to be converted, and to what uses, in order to achieve the greatest possible efficiency, shifts that would require some degree of regulation and central planning.
Producing more on smaller plots of land would need a combination of investments, incentives and mandates to ease farmers onto different lands and into better practices. The authors explicitly reject land expropriation as a strategy.
Some of that could be fairly simple. Damania said that the gains his team estimated could be achieved by scaling up well-established techniques, like setting up buffer zones around rivers and terracing hillsides to reduce runoff. To help small farmers get more from their acreage, the researchers recommend better access to credit, strengthened land ownership rights and direct subsidies for equipment like irrigation pipes that waste less water.
There are already promising test cases. Take Ethiopia, where programs supported by the World Bank have improved the quality of vegetation across millions of hectares by establishing cooperatives to replant degraded forests. Eventually, the project could generate revenue through payments for reduction in carbon emissions.
But adopting new farming practices and changing policies are the easier steps. Reaching the model's full potential would also require paying people to move and farm somewhere else, or to find a new line of work. That's where the real money comes in.
"Where you are retiring land or changing its use, if you are going to get losers, my own personal view is that you have to compensate the losers," Damania said. "And if you don't, you're going to bump into resistance."
The money is already out there.
Fortunately, there's already one big source of available cash: the $ 1.25 trillion in direct subsidies that governments provide annually for agriculture, marine industries and fossil fuel extraction, as the bank found in a separate report published this month. Those payments and tax breaks fuel deforestation, overfishing and excessive use of resources like fertilizer, which can be toxic in large amounts. Repurposing those financial supports would thus give a double boost to countries trying to be more efficient, though that poses huge political challenges.
As with all sweeping plans, it's important to watch out for unintended consequences. Ed Davey, partnerships director at the Food and Land Use Coalition, who reviewed the report and generally agrees with the gist, said he saw two.
First, increasing the intensity of agriculture can have plenty of environmental downsides, currently visible in places like the Netherlands, which has achieved incredible productivity but contaminated many of its waterways with nitrogen runoff from livestock operations. Second, increasing crop yields can actually amplify incentives to push into protected areas, since the soil becomes even more lucrative. That makes the rule of law paramount.
Spending on enforcement may pay off amply, though. In Brazil, for example, the World Bank calculates that the forest provides about $ 20 billion in value for farmers that includes rain, healthy soils and lower fire risks. That's several times more than Brazil is spending to keep people from illegally clearing land.
Caveats and all, to Davey, it's essential to make it work, along with reductions in both food waste and beef consumption.
"It's absolutely clear to us that there's no way of feeding a global population of nearly 10 billion people by 2050 absent those efficiency gains," he said.

The Lesson of The Saga of Hunter Biden: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One of our most urgent national problems is addiction to drugs and alcohol. It now kills about a quarter-million Americans a year, leaves many others homeless and causes unimaginable heartache in families across the country -- including the family living in the White House.
Hunter Biden, who has written about his tangles with crack cocaine and alcohol, reached a plea agreement on tax charges a few days ago that left some Republicans sputtering, but to me, the main takeaway is a lesson the country and the president could absorb to save lives.
While the federal investigation appears to be ongoing, for now I see no clear evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden himself -- but the president does offer the country a fine model of the love and support that people with addictions need.
When Biden was vice president and trailed by Secret Service agents, he once tracked down Hunter when he was on a bender and refused to leave until his son committed to entering treatment. Biden then gave his son a tight hug and promised to return to make sure he followed through.
"Dad saved me," Hunter wrote in his memoir, "Beautiful Things," adding: "Left on my own, I'm certain I would not have survived."
On another occasion, the Biden family staged an intervention, and Hunter stormed out of the house. Biden ran down the driveway after his son. "He grabbed me, swung me around and hugged me," Hunter wrote. "He held me tight in the dark and cried for the longest time."
Last year Sean Hannity broadcast an audio recording of a voice mail message that President Biden left for Hunter. Hannity thought it reflected badly on the president; my reaction was that if more parents showed this kind of support for children in crisis, our national addiction nightmare might be easier to overcome.
"It's Dad," the president says in the message, and he sounds near tears. "I'm calling to tell you I love you. I love you more than the whole world, pal. You gotta get some help. I don't know what to do. I know you don't, either. But I'm here, no matter what you need. No matter what you need. I love you."
I don't have family members with addictions, but I've lost far too many friends to drugs and alcohol. At this moment, I have two friends who have disappeared, abandoning their children, and when last seen were homeless, abusing drugs and supporting themselves by selling fentanyl. I fear every day that they'll die from an overdose, or that they'll sell drugs to someone else who overdoses.
I'm terrified for them and furious at them -- but even more, I'm outraged that so many Americans are suffering pain and inflicting pain, yet our policies toward addiction are lackadaisical and ineffective: Only about 6 percent of people with substance use disorder get treatment, according to the federal government. We should be expanding access, boosting research for medication-assisted treatment, pressing China harder to curb exports of fentanyl precursors and addressing the economic despair that drives some people to substance abuse.
The Bidens benefited from the connections and resources often necessary to access detox and rehab programs; these should be readily available to all.
Some Republicans allege that the president himself was engaged in influence peddling, and that Hunter received favorable treatment from the Justice Department; an I.R.S. whistle-blower who assisted in the investigation says that a prosecutor in the Justice Department did indeed interfere on the side of Hunter. Maybe there will be future revelations, but for now, as best I can sort things out: 1) Hunter acted inappropriately to monetize his proximity to the White House, just as Donald Trump and members of his family did; and 2) Joe Biden acted honorably (although I do think it was a mistake to take Hunter to China on Air Force Two in 2013 when he was pursuing business there, and Biden was flatly wrong to say in May that "my son has done nothing wrong").
The Biden administration kept on a Trump appointee as U.S. attorney in Delaware, precisely to continue an independent and credible investigation of Hunter. The prosecutors appear to have pored over 15 years of Hunter's business dealings and have not so far identified any misconduct by the president. And the plea agreement the prosecutor reached with Hunter does not seem lenient. (Most people in similar circumstances, including Roger Stone, have not been prosecuted criminally.)
Congressional Republicans will continue to make allegations. Some Democrats have seemed reluctant to engage, perhaps finding the Hunter saga sordid and likely to taint those who touch it. I think that's a mistake. What I see is an opportunity for the president to take on the nation's drug and alcohol problem as forcefully as he took on his son's. Hunter Biden appears to have come back from the brink, and that can reassure families now in despair; millions of desperate Americans could use that hope.
One precedent: The former first lady Betty Ford's heroic acknowledgment in the 1970s of her struggles with drugs and alcohol pulled back the curtain on addiction and got many more people into treatment.
Joe Biden undertook a major federal push to combat cancer after it claimed his son Beau; I wish he would transform his administration's present ineffective effort against addiction into a similar all-out initiative against the forces that almost killed Hunter.

Max Morath, Pianist Of Ragtime Soaked In Sepia, Dies at 96: [Biography]

Author: Mcfadden, Robert D

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A student of both music and history, he entertained audiences in the 1960s and beyond while educating them about a genre whose heyday had ended decades earlier.
Max Morath, who stepped out of the 1890s only a lifetime late, and with syncopated piano rhythms and social commentary helped revive the ragtime age on television programs, in concert halls and in nightclubs for nearly a half-century, died on Monday in Duluth, Minn. He was 96.
His wife, Diane Fay Skomars, confirmed the death, at a care facility near his home.
Having learned the rudiments of music from his mother, who played a tinkling piano in movie theaters for silent films, Mr. Morath -- after false career starts as a radio announcer, newscaster and actor -- found his calling in a fascination with ragtime, the uniquely syncopated, "ragged" style whose heyday spanned two decades, roughly from 1897 to 1917.
A college-educated student of both music and history, he fell in love with ragtime's dreamlike, bittersweet sounds and began researching the styles and repertoires of its era. He combed libraries, studied piano rolls and old sheet music, consulted historical societies, read antique magazines and talked to folks old enough to recall the work of the ragtime greats and the milestones of their age.
What emerged was a new form of entertainment that combined showmanship with scholarly commentaries on ragtime itself, on its players and fans, and on the etiquette and tastes of a long-vanished age when horses pulled streetcars and women's suffrage was still just a dream of the future.
In a straw boater and sleeve garters, pounding an old upright with a cigar clenched in his teeth, Mr. Morath played Scott Joplin's "Maple Leaf Rag," Jelly Roll Morton's "Tiger Rag" and Eubie Blake's "Charleston Rag." In those moments he might have been a vaudeville copycat trading on nostalgia. But his mood grew serious -- and strangely more engaging -- when he paused to tell audiences what they were hearing.
"Ragtime is the folk music of the city," he would explain. "It represents 25 years of a music that's been overlooked.
"Classic ragtime isn't the honky-tonk music you hear today. That's just a popular misconception. Nobody has paid the classic ragtime much attention, because of the attitude that folk music had to come from the hills. We were looking in the wrong direction."
Mr. Morath made ragtime come alive again. In the 1890s, he said, people heard it in vaudeville houses or just walking around town. There were newfangled inventions: player pianos, phonographs and nickelodeons. Middle-class homes had upright pianos. Sheet music was booming. Tin Pan Alley, the Manhattan home of the songwriters who dominated popular music, was flourishing.
After a few years in clubs and on radio and television in the West and in his native Colorado, Mr. Morath broke through in 1960 at KRMA-TV, Denver's educational TV station. He wrote and produced "The Ragtime Era," a series of 12 half-hour shows on the music and history of ragtime and the blues, as well as the origins of musical comedy and Tin Pan Alley, for the 60-station National Educational Television network, the predecessor of PBS.
Reviewing that series for The New York Times, Jack Gould wrote: "In an uncommon mixture of earthiness, emphasized by his chewing of a big cigar and wearing of loud vests, and erudition, reflected in his knowledgeable commentary on music and the social forces that influence its expression, he presides over a wonderful rag piano and lets go."
The series was bought by commercial stations, greatly expanding Mr. Morath's audience. He was soon juggling recording dates, college gigs (some 50 a year), and concert and club bookings. He also created another NET series, "The Turn of the Century" (1962): 15 installments that related ragtime music to its social, economic and political period, using lantern slides, photographs and other props.
With its wider focus -- on life in America from 1890 to the 1920s -- "The Turn of the Century" was a runaway success. In addition to being seen in syndication on commercial television, it became a one-man theatrical show. Mr. Morath presented it at the Blue Angel and the Village Vanguard in New York, took it to the Off Broadway Jan Hus Playhouse in 1969 and then toured nationally for many years.
"In a two-hour jaunty excursion, Morath gives us a look at the 30-year period that spanned the time of McGuffey's Reader, women's suffrage, the grizzly bear dance, Prohibition, legal marijuana and Teddy Roosevelt," The Washington Post said when Mr. Morath opened at Ford's Theater in 1970. "It was a time of sweeping changes in the moral climate of our nation, and Morath uses popular music, chiefly ragtime, as the centrifugal force for sorting out the different phases."
As the ragtime revival surged into the 1970s, it was given momentum by the musicologist Joshua Rifkin, who recorded much of Scott Joplin's work for the Nonesuch label in 1971, and by the success of George Roy Hill's Oscar-winning film "The Sting" (1973), starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford as con artists, which featured Joplin's "The Entertainer" on the soundtrack.
Mr. Morath appeared on "The Bell Telephone Hour," "Kraft Music Hall," "Today," "The Tonight Show" and Arthur Godfrey's radio and television programs. A series of Morath productions -- "The Ragtime Years," "Living the Ragtime Life," "The Ragtime Man," "Ragtime Revisited," and "Ragtime and Again" -- opened Off Broadway and were followed by national tours.
"I must have played in 5,000 different places, and many of them were not all that classy," Mr. Morath said in 2019 in an interview for this obituary. "Mostly they were saloons, and it wasn't all ragtime either. Some of them were piano bars. When you work a piano bar, you'd better know 1,500 tunes. You're playing requests. It was Gershwin. Cole Porter. Rodgers and Hart."
Mr. Morath continued touring until he retired in 2007. By then, he had long been known as "Mr. Ragtime," the unofficial keeper of America's ragtime legacy.
Asked for a favorite memory from his life in music, he reached back to his childhood.
"Actually," he said after a moment's thought, "it was when I was 7 and I heard my mother play something Joplin wrote, called 'The Original Rag.' It was published in Kansas City, and somehow my mother got ahold of it. We had a piano bench full of good stuff, mostly show tunes. But 'Original Rag' was my favorite."
Max Edward Morath was born in Colorado Springs on Oct. 1, 1926, the younger of two sons of Frederic Morath, a real estate broker, and Gladys (Ramsell) Morath. When Max was 4, his parents divorced. His mother became society editor of The Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph, and his father went to Europe, remarried and spent his days climbing in the Alps and the Pyrenees.
Max and his brother, Frederic, attended local public schools. He was active in choir and theater at Colorado Springs High School and, in his senior year, got a job as a radio announcer with KVOR (the call letters stand for Voice of the Rockies). After he graduated in 1944, he paid his way through Colorado College as a pianist and newscaster for the station. He majored in English and earned a bachelor's degree in 1948.
In 1953, he married Norma Loy Tackitt. They had three children before divorcing in 1992. He married Ms. Skomars, an author and photographer, in 1993.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Morath is survived by two daughters, Kathryn Morath and Christy Mainthow; a son, Frederic; a stepdaughter, Monette Fay Magrath; five grandchildren; and a great-grandson. His brother died in 2009.
In a recording career that began in 1955, Mr. Morath made more than 30 albums, mostly of unaccompanied piano solos, for Epic, RCA Victor, Vanguard and other labels. His original compositions were recorded by the pianist and composer Aaron Robinson and released in 2015 as "Max Morath: The Complete Ragtime Works for Piano."
Mr. Morath wrote an illustrated memoir, "The Road to Ragtime" (1999), and "I Love You Truly: A Biographical Novel Based on the Life of Carrie Jacobs-Bond" (2008), about the first woman to establish a music publishing firm in America. She had been the subject of a paper Mr. Morath wrote for his master's degree, which he earned at Columbia University in 1996.
In 2016, Mr. Morath was inducted into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame, along with the bandleaders Paul Whiteman and Glenn Miller. "It made me feel really great," he said. "Of course, they're both Colorado boys. I felt I was in very good company."

NEW YORK — At an intersection in Brooklyn, Bangladeshi immigrants take some of their first steps toward new lives. Where Church and McDonald Avenues meet, the scent of milky tea fills the air, and Bengali is more common than English.
For decades, construction work was a primary trade for members of the Bangladeshi community in Kensington, a Brooklyn neighborhood. But the once-familiar morning rumble of contractors’ vans now has given way to the afternoon whirl of e-bikes making deliveries.
In the evenings, groups of men leave their crowded, subdivided apartments for adda, an informal gathering to catch up, often with snacks and tea.
Since the early 1970s, Bangladeshi immigrants have expanded their footprint with businesses, newfound political influence and places to worship. For many, the city now feels like home.
The number of Bangladeshis in New York City has nearly tripled over the past decade to more than 100,000. New communities dot the city, and their growth has helped make Asians the fastest-growing racial group in the city, according to the latest census data.
In Brooklyn last October, a corner in Kensington became one of a handful of places officially given the name “Little Bangladesh.” There, the intersection of Church and McDonald has become a beacon for newly arrived Bangladeshis — a jumping-off point where newcomers can find apartments, jobs and friends.
“Everybody is coming here for socializing, but also to think about the next day,” said Sohel Mahmud, 54, a Bangladeshi journalist who runs ProbasiTV, an online news site covering the diaspora, out of a rowhouse a few steps away.
Young Bangladeshi Americans are making inroads into politics, most notably with the election of Shahana Hanif, a daughter of Kensington, to the City Council in 2021. Hanif’s victory, at age 30, made her the first woman to represent the district, as well as the first Muslim woman and one of the first two South Asians on the council.
It was Hanif who requested the intersection’s new name. She also co-sponsored a resolution to make Feb. 21 Mother Language Day, in tandem with a holiday in Bangladesh commemorating protesters who fought for Bengali as a state language in the 1950s, when the area was part of Pakistan.
Hanif’s family history illustrates how Bangladeshi Kensington came to be. Her father arrived in the early ’80s and worked his way up in construction and restaurants, and came to own a local mainstay, Radhuni Sweets & Restaurant, which is now run by others.
Her experiences in the neighborhood drove her to make sure that all members of the community feel welcome in its public spaces. While the corner is often a male-dominated space, she and other Bangladeshi American women have carved out their own places there.
“I grew up like, ‘Wear a shawl over your chest, look down,’” Hanif said. “There was a script. And I think many of us did not follow that script and pursued our own paths in an interesting, unique way.”
In recent years, Bangladeshis have come to the United States, as so many other migrants, after a perilous journey through Latin America. Some hope to apply for asylum; some are looking for a way to earn money to send home; some simply seek a better life.
Many of the Bangladeshis in Kensington hail from rural areas around the Bay of Bengal: Noakhali, Chittagong and Sandwip. Among them is Mir Hossain, 47. He arrived five years ago, after he said he was attacked for his political allegiances.
Hossain found the building blocks of his new life on the corner in Kensington, drawing on his years of experience in metalwork.
Hossain crossed through 19 countries on his monthslong journey to Brooklyn. He flew from the Middle East to South America and then trekked on foot through the Darién Gap, which divides Colombia and Panama, picking up work along the way when he could.
His bet seems to be paying off. He received asylum, and then a green card. He landed his apartment and jobs through connections he made on the corner, and rose from day laborer to subcontractor. Now he picks up other workers from the corner in his Ford F-150 truck.
But still, something is missing. His wife and two children remain in Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital. He hopes they will be able to join him in Brooklyn soon.
“I don’t sleep well,” he said. “I miss my family.”
Kensington’s gathering spaces have also become crucial networking opportunities for the growing number of young Bangladeshi men working for food delivery apps like Seamless and DoorDash, a path that became more lucrative during the pandemic.
Many deliverymen zip around wealthier areas like nearby Park Slope during the dinner rush, and then head to Kensington for their own meals.
Working for the apps can offer more flexibility than construction. But the potential for danger is constant: accidents, terrible weather and crime, all without the protections offered by steady employment.
In October 2021, a Bangladeshi deliveryman named Sala Miah was fatally stabbed during a robbery at a Manhattan park where he had stopped to rest after a long shift. Miah’s funeral was held at one of several Bangladeshi mosques in Kensington. He was 51.
Rubel Uddin’s younger brother, Tarek Aziz, was killed in 2021 when he hit a patch of gravel while riding his scooter delivering a late order. It was hot out the day of the accident, and he wasn’t wearing a helmet.
“In our life we are being tested,” said Uddin, who is 34. “Everything is temporary.”
When his mother calls from Bangladesh, she begs her son to stop doing delivery work.
Although Uddin remains deeply depressed about his brother’s death, he has continued because he needs the income. He uses a car now instead of a moped.
Uddin lives with six other men in a three-bedroom apartment in East New York crowded with plants that remind him of the verdant village he left a decade ago. His roommates deliver food, drive taxis or do construction, and they all pay rent to a fellow Bangladeshi who owns the building.
They do their shopping in Kensington, as well as in Bangladeshi shops in Jackson Heights and Ozone Park in Queens, and he appreciates the sense of community. But he is weighing his limited options and considering leaving New York.
Others also still dream of home. Motiul, 54, who asked that his last name not be used because of his legal status, arrived in New York as a cargo-ship crewman in 2018 with $100 in his pocket. He headed straight to the home of a Bangladeshi friend in Kensington, and he stayed after his short-term visa expired.
His story harks back to some of the earliest Bangladeshis in New York, who came in the 1920s as “ship jumpers,” men who worked on ships and stayed in the city once they docked here.
These days, Motiul mostly renovates building exteriors, working on scaffolding on high floors, which can net him as much as $350 a day. He also traveled to Philadelphia to work for a Bangladeshi contractor there. But work is excruciatingly slow — sometimes only a couple of days a month — and the cost of living is high.
His mind is back in his small town in the Jessore District, where renovations are underway on his family home. He oversees the process from afar, instructing workers in the brick-pointing techniques he has learned in New York. His wife and three grown children have urged him to return.
“They say I have done enough for them,” he said.
Some women in the community are pushing to create new opportunities for themselves, but also to preserve their language and culture, especially for Bangladeshi children growing up in a diverse city.
Farojan Saeed, 28, moved to New York in 2016 to join her husband, Syed Rehan, who works in technology.
Now Saeed teaches dance at a local public school and at the Bangladesh Institute of Performing Arts, which promotes the arts and language of Bangladesh and holds classes in the neighborhood. She also works as an intake coordinator for a home health care company.
Her husband has been living for more than 20 years in the same small apartment in Kensington, which they now share with his parents.
Saeed wants to buy a house, but real estate in Kensington has become far too expensive. She is considering Jamaica, Queens, where the performing arts institute has another outpost.
Annie Ferdous helped found the Bangladeshi Institute of Performing Arts in the early ’90s. She is trying to carve out a space inside a conservative culture where dance is often frowned upon. Some see it as incompatible with their interpretation of Islam.
Saeed also faced opposition as she was growing up, from relatives on her mother’s side who frowned upon dance. But her father pushed for her to be allowed to pursue her art, which she calls her first love.
With other public spaces so dominated by men, Ferdous sees it as vital that women gather to keep their traditions alive. She calls it “constructive adda.”
“Those of us who can, if we lead the path and move forward, then a few others will think, ‘Let me also, we have a space,’” she said.
The neighborhood buzzed at the end of Ramadan, as Bangladeshis from around the city gathered to worship, do charitable works and break their fasts each night. The faithful filled nearly a whole block of McDonald Avenue during Eid al-Fitr, the festival celebrated at the end of Ramadan.
Mahmud, the journalist, was among them. As men greeted one another with warm hugs after the service, he said it felt like home.

As U.S.-China Ties Sour, Chinese Brands Seek Space From Beijing: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Companies are moving headquarters and factories outside the country and cleaving off their Chinese businesses. It's not clear the strategy will work.
As it expanded internationally, Shein, the rapidly growing fast fashion app, progressively cut ties to its home country, China. It moved its headquarters to Singapore and de-registered its original company in Nanjing. It set up operations in Ireland and Indiana, and hired Washington lobbyists to highlight its U.S. expansion plans as it prepares for a potential initial public offering this year.
Yet the clothing retailer can't shake the focus on its ties with China. Along with other brands like the viral social app TikTok and shopping app Temu, Shein has become a target of American lawmakers in both parties. Politicians are accusing the company of making its clothes with fabric made with forced labor and calling it a tool of the Chinese Communist Party -- claims that Shein denies.
"No one should be fooled by Shein's efforts to cover its tracks," Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, wrote in a letter to other lawmakers this month.
As relations between the United States and China turn increasingly rocky, some of China's most entrepreneurial brands have taken steps to distance themselves from their home country. They have set up new factories and headquarters outside China to serve the United States and other foreign markets, emphasized their foreign ties and scrubbed any mention of "China" from their corporate websites.
TikTok has set up headquarters in Los Angeles and Singapore, and invested in new U.S. operations that it says will wall off its American user data from its parent company, ByteDance. Temu has established a headquarters in Boston, and its parent company, PDD Holdings, has moved its headquarters from China to Ireland.
Chinese solar companies have set up factories outside China to avoid U.S. tariffs on solar panels from China and limit their exposure to Xinjiang, a region that the United States now bars imports from because of its use of forced labor.
JinkoSolar, a behemoth that produces one in 10 solar modules installed globally, has set up a supply chain entirely outside China to make goods for the United States.
Other companies, including those that are foreign-owned, are building walls between their Chinese operations and their global businesses, judging that this is the best way to avoid running afoul of new restrictions or risks to their reputation.
Sequoia Capital, the venture capital firm, said last week that it would split its global business into three independent partnerships, spinning off unique entities for China and India.
Shein said in a statement that it was "a multinational company with diversified operations around the world and customers in 150 markets, and we make all business decisions with that in mind." The company said it had zero tolerance for forced labor, did not source cotton from Xinjiang and fully complied with all U.S. tax and trade laws.
A spokesperson for TikTok said that the Chinese Communist Party had neither direct nor indirect control of ByteDance or TikTok, and that ByteDance was a private, global company with offices around the world.
"Roughly 60 percent of ByteDance is owned by global institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, and its C.E.O. resides in Singapore," said Brooke Oberwetter, a spokesperson.
Temu did not respond to requests for comment.
Analysts said companies were being driven out of China by a variety of motivations, including better access to foreign customers and an escape from the risk of a crackdown by the Chinese authorities.
Some companies have more practical concerns, like reducing their costs for labor and shipping, lowering their tax bills or shedding the shoddy reputation that American buyers continue to associate with goods made in China, said Shay Luo, a principal at the consulting firm Kearney who studies supply chains.
But a wave of tougher restrictions in the United States on doing business with China appears to be having an effect, too.
Research by Altana, a supply chain technology company, shows that since 2016, new regulations, customs enforcement actions and trade policies that hurt Chinese exports to the United States were followed by "adaptive behavior," like setting up new subsidiaries outside China, said Evan Smith, the company's chief executive.
For Chinese companies, going global is not a new phenomenon. The Chinese government initiated a "go out" policy at the turn of the century to encourage state-owned enterprises to invest abroad to gain overseas markets, natural resources and technology.
Private companies like the electronics firm Lenovo, the appliance maker Haier and the e-commerce giant Alibaba soon followed, seeking investment targets and new customers.
As tensions between the United States and China have risen in recent years, investment flows between the countries have slowed. U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods put in place by President Donald J. Trump and maintained by President Biden encouraged companies to move manufacturing from China to countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Mexico. The pandemic, which halted factories in China and raised costs for moving goods across the ocean, accelerated the trend.
International companies are now increasingly adopting a "China plus one" model of securing an additional source of goods in another country in case of supply interruptions in China. Chinese companies, too, are following this practice, Ms. Luo said.
In the 12 months that ended in April, the share of imports to the United States from China reached its lowest level since 2006.
"It is definitely a rational strategy for these companies to offshore, to move manufacturing or their headquarters to a third country," said Roselyn Hsueh, an associate professor of political science at Temple University.
In addition to tariffs and the ban on products from the Xinjiang region, the United States has imposed new restrictions on trade in technology and tougher security reviews for Chinese investments.
The Chinese government, too, is clamping down on the transfer of data and currency outside the country, and it has squashed some Chinese companies' efforts to list their stocks on American exchanges because of such concerns.
Beijing has detained and harassed top tech executives, and foreign consulting firms. And its draconian lockdowns during the pandemic made clear to businesses that they operate in China at the mercy of the government.
"Companies like Shein and TikTok move overseas both to reduce their U.S. regulatory and reputational risk, but also to reduce the likelihood that their founders and staff get intimidated or arrested by Chinese officials," said Isaac Stone Fish, the chief executive of Strategy Risks, a consultant on corporate exposure to China.
But companies like Shein and Temu still source nearly all of their products from China, and it's not clear that the changes the Chinese companies are making to their businesses have done much to lower the heat.
The opposition to these companies in Washington is being fueled by an incendiary combination of legitimate concerns over national security and forced labor, and the political appeal of appearing tough on China. It also appears to be driven by the opposition of certain competitors to these services, which are now some of the most downloaded apps in the United States.
In March, a group called Shut Down Shein sprang up to pressure Congress to crack down on the retailer. The group, which has hired five lobbyists with the firm Actum, declined to disclose who is funding its campaign.
In a five-hour hearing in March, lawmakers grilled TikTok's chief executive over whether it would make U.S. user data available to the Chinese government, or censor the information broadcast to young Americans. Legislation is being considered that could permanently ban the app.
Some lawmakers are arguing that JinkoSolar's U.S.-made panels should not be eligible for government tax credits, and, for reasons that have not yet been disclosed, the company's Florida factory was raided by customs officials last month.
State governments, which have often been more welcoming to Chinese investment, are also growing more hostile. In January, Glenn Youngkin, the Republican governor of Virginia, blocked a deal for Ford Motor to set up a factory using technology from a Chinese battery maker, Contemporary Amperex Technology, calling it a "Trojan-horse relationship."
A House committee set up to examine economic and security competition with China is investigating the ties that Temu and Shein have with forced labor in China, and lawmakers are calling for Shein to be audited before its I.P.O.
"The message of our investigation of Shein, Temu, Adidas and Nike is clear: Either ensure your supply chains are clean -- no matter how difficult it is -- or get out of countries like China implicated in forced labor," Representative Mike Gallagher, the Republican chair of the committee, said in a statement.
An investigation by Bloomberg in November found that some of Shein's clothes were made with cotton grown in Xinjiang. In a statement, Shein said it had "built a four-step approach to ensure compliance" with the law, including a "code of conduct, independent audits, robust tracing technology and third-party testing.

New Drugs Can Treat Obesity, But Stigma Is a Different Story: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wegovy and other drugs expose a social tension between a quest to medicate illness and a stigmatizing belief that obese people lack sufficient willpower to lose weight.
Eileen Isotalo was always able to lose weight, but always gained it back. Now 66, her first diet was with Weight Watchers at age 14. She went on to try one diet after another and bought so many books on weight loss that she thinks she has more than the public library.
In desperation, she finally went to a weight management clinic at the University of Michigan. She had sleep apnea and aching knees, but could not curb her appetite.
"It's just this drive to eat," said Ms. Isotalo, a retired interior design coordinator. "It's almost like this panic feeling when you start craving food."
"My mental shame was profound," she said.
Now, though, since she started taking Wegovy, one of a new class of drugs for obesity that was prescribed by her doctor at the clinic, those cravings are gone. She has lost 50 pounds and jettisoned the dark clothes she wore to hide her body. Her obesity-related medical problems have vanished along with much of the stigma that caused her to retreat from family and friends.
But like others at the clinic, she still struggles with the fear others will judge her for receiving injections to treat her obesity rather than finding the willpower to lose weight and keep it off.
Yet the drug, she said, "changed my life."
Wegovy and drugs like it make this "a very exciting time in the field," said Dr. Susan Yanovski, co-director of the office of obesity research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
About 100 million Americans, or 42 percent of the adult population, have obesity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the first time, people with obesity, who faced a lifetime of medical jeopardy, can escape the ruthless trap of fruitless dieting and see their obesity-related health problems mitigated, along with the weight loss.
But there is still the taint.
"There's a moral component to it," Dr. Yanovski said. "People really believe that people with obesity just need to summon their willpower and they think that taking a medicine is the easy way out."
Unlike other chronic diseases, obesity is on full public display, Dr. Yanovski said. "No one looks at you and knows you have high cholesterol or high blood pressure," she said.
Obesity, she added, "is one of the most stigmatized conditions out there."
Wegovy and a similar but less effective medication, Saxenda, are the only ones in their class of drugs so far to be approved for the treatment of obesity -- others like Ozempic and Mounjaro are diabetes drugs but also spur weight loss.
Novo Nordisk, Wegovy's maker, reports that doctors in the United States have written about 110,000 prescriptions for the drug. Citing a huge demand, the company recently put its advertising for Wegovy on hold.
"We can't make enough," said Ambre James-Brown, a Novo Nordisk spokeswoman. Supplies are so limited that the company is only selling the drug in the United States, Norway and Denmark, the company's corporate headquarters. Its high list price of $ 1,349 a month puts it out of reach for most whose insurance will not cover it. But increasingly many insurers do.
The drugs have arrived at a time when researchers have documented the risks of obesity and the futility of prescribing only diet and exercise as a treatment. Decades of studies have consistently shown that very few people can lose excess weight and keep it off with lifestyle changes alone.
People with obesity are at risk for a variety of serious medical conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, sleep apnea and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a leading reason for liver transplants in the United States.
Losing weight can make some of these complications vanish.
Yet the belief persists -- fed by diet gurus, influencers and an industry selling supplements and diet plans -- that if people really really tried, they could shed pounds.
So those who take a drug like Wegovy often end up in uncomfortable situations that are influenced by the common view that obesity is a lifestyle choice.
At the University of Michigan clinic there are those like Ms. Isotalo whose reluctance to admit to taking Wegovy stems from her conviction that those who take it are often thought to be cheating.
Another patient, though, Katarra Ewing of Detroit, readily tells anyone who asks that she takes the drug. She tried diets, but it was Wegovy that allowed her to lose 90 pounds.
She came to the weight management clinic after her all-night shift at a Ford factory, ebullient and vibrant, wearing a vivid green sweater. She has more energy now that she lost the weight, her mood is brighter, her high blood pressure gone.
But she discovered an unintended social consequence to weight loss, as many longtime friends fell away.
"Only my genuine friends are left and that's a very small number," Ms. Ewing said.
Obesity medicine specialists say they are not surprised -- they see the same thing after people lose weight with bariatric surgery.
Relationships shift because obesity is such a defining condition. People of normal weight may feel superior to a friend with obesity and that helps define a relationship -- until the friend loses weight. Other friends who themselves have obesity may use the condition as a bonding factor in the relationship. Now that is gone.
Another issue is the drugs' reputation as vanity medications, which has been amplified by comedians' punchlines at the Oscars and in other high-profile settings.
But when Samuel Simpson came to the weight management clinic, he considered losing weight to be a matter of life or death.
Mr. Simpson was terrified he'd face the fate of his mother, brother and sister, all of whom had obesity and diabetes. They all developed kidney failure that ultimately killed them, each dying at the age of 59.
His first appointment with Dr. Amy Rothberg at the clinic was nearly two years ago, when he was 58. He had obesity and diabetes. Although he was taking high doses of insulin to lower his blood sugar, his kidneys were starting to fail.
"I was so afraid," he said. "Was I going to end up on dialysis like everyone else? I'd be history."
He began with a diet and then Dr. Rothberg added Mounjaro, a drug by Eli Lilly that appears to be even more powerful than Wegovy in eliciting weight loss, but is, so far, only approved for people with diabetes.
Now he's lost 44 pounds, 20 percent of his original weight, and his diabetes is in remission. The weight loss, he said, "turned my life around."
He will tell those who ask how he lost the weight,
"I'm not like the roadside preacher but when someone asks me how I did this I will tell them," he said.
Art Regner had a different issue. A garrulous color commentator for the Detroit Red Wings hockey team, he said he was not ready to resort to medication. But when he came to Dr. Rothberg's clinic he was chagrined. He'd regained 22 of the 76 pounds he lost by dieting.
Dr. Rothberg, who is also the medical director of Rewind, a company that counsels diabetic patients, suggested Wegovy or Mounjaro. But Mr. Regner felt he should have enough willpower to do it on his own. He knows his blood sugar is high and is aware of the consequences of diabetes.
Dr. Rothberg gently explained to him that it was not his fault he kept regaining weight every time he lost some.
"I think biology is conspiring against you," she said. "I don't think it's a matter of willpower."
Mr. Regner was not swayed. "I believe in myself," he said. "I wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and say, 'Are you going to do it or aren't you?"'

ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Eileen Isotalo was always able to lose weight, but always gained it back. Now 66, her first diet was with Weight Watchers at age 14. She went on to try one diet after another and bought so many books on weight loss that she thinks she has more than the public library.
In desperation, she finally went to a weight management clinic at the University of Michigan. She had sleep apnea and aching knees, but could not curb her appetite.
“It’s just this drive to eat,” said Isotalo, a retired interior design coordinator. “It’s almost like this panic feeling when you start craving food.”
“My mental shame was profound,” she said.
Now, though, since she started taking Wegovy, one of a new class of drugs for obesity that was prescribed by her doctor at the clinic, those cravings are gone. She has lost 50 pounds and jettisoned the dark clothes she wore to hide her body. Her obesity-related medical problems have vanished along with much of the stigma that caused her to retreat from family and friends.
But like others at the clinic, she still struggles with the fear others will judge her for receiving injections to treat her obesity rather than finding the willpower to lose weight and keep it off.
Yet the drug, she said, “changed my life.”
Wegovy and drugs like it make this “a very exciting time in the field,” said Dr. Susan Yanovski, co-director of the office of obesity research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
About 100 million Americans, or 42% of the adult population, have obesity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the first time, people with obesity, who faced a lifetime of medical jeopardy, can escape the ruthless trap of fruitless dieting and see their obesity-related health problems mitigated, along with the weight loss.
But there is still the taint.
“There’s a moral component to it,” Yanovski said. “People really believe that people with obesity just need to summon their willpower and they think that taking a medicine is the easy way out.”
Unlike other chronic diseases, obesity is on full public display, Yanovski said. “No one looks at you and knows you have high cholesterol or high blood pressure,” she said.
Obesity, she added, “is one of the most stigmatized conditions out there. “
Wegovy and a similar but less effective medication, Saxenda, are the only ones in their class of drugs so far to be approved for the treatment of obesity — others like Ozempic and Mounjaro are diabetes drugs but also spur weight loss.
Novo Nordisk, Wegovy’s maker, reports that doctors in the United States have written about 110,000 prescriptions for the drug. Citing a huge demand, the company recently put its advertising for Wegovy on hold.
“We can’t make enough,” said Ambre James-Brown, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson. Supplies are so limited that the company is only selling the drug in the United States, Norway and Denmark, the company’s corporate headquarters. Its high list price of $1,349 a month puts it out of reach for most whose insurance will not cover it. But increasingly many insurers do.
The drugs have arrived at a time when researchers have documented the risks of obesity and the futility of prescribing only diet and exercise as a treatment. Decades of studies have consistently shown that very few people can lose excess weight and keep it off with lifestyle changes alone.
People with obesity are at risk for a variety of serious medical conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, sleep apnea and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a leading reason for liver transplants in the United States.
Losing weight can make some of these complications vanish.
Yet the belief persists — fed by diet gurus, influencers and an industry selling supplements and diet plans — that if people really really tried, they could shed pounds.
So those who take a drug like Wegovy often end up in uncomfortable situations that are influenced by the common view that obesity is a lifestyle choice.
At the University of Michigan clinic there are those like Isotalo whose reluctance to admit to taking Wegovy stems from her conviction that those who take it are often thought to be cheating.
Another patient, though, Katarra Ewing of Detroit, readily tells anyone who asks that she takes the drug. She tried diets, but it was Wegovy that allowed her to lose 90 pounds.
She came to the weight management clinic after her all-night shift at a Ford factory, ebullient and vibrant, wearing a vivid green sweater. She has more energy now that she lost the weight, her mood is brighter, her high blood pressure gone.
But she discovered an unintended social consequence to weight loss, as many longtime friends fell away.
“Only my genuine friends are left and that’s a very small number,” Ewing said.
Obesity medicine specialists say they are not surprised — they see the same thing after people lose weight with bariatric surgery.
Relationships shift because obesity is such a defining condition. People of normal weight may feel superior to a friend with obesity and that helps define a relationship — until the friend loses weight. Other friends who themselves have obesity may use the condition as a bonding factor in the relationship. Now that is gone.
Another issue is the drugs’ reputation as vanity medications, which has been amplified by comedians’ punchlines at the Oscars and in other high-profile settings.
But when Samuel Simpson came to the weight management clinic, he considered losing weight to be a matter of life or death.
Simpson was terrified he’d face the fate of his mother, brother and sister, all of whom had obesity and diabetes. They all developed kidney failure that ultimately killed them, each dying at the age of 59.

As Ties to China Turn Toxic, Even Chinese Companies Are Breaking Them

WASHINGTON — As it expanded internationally, Shein, the rapidly growing fast fashion app, progressively cut ties to its home country, China. It moved its headquarters to Singapore and deregistered its original company in Nanjing. It set up operations in Ireland and Indiana, and hired Washington lobbyists to highlight its U.S. expansion plans as it prepares for a potential initial public offering this year.
Yet the clothing retailer can’t shake the focus on its ties with China. Along with other brands including the viral social app TikTok and shopping app Temu, Shein has become a target of U.S. lawmakers in both parties. Politicians are accusing the company of making its clothes with fabric made with forced labor and calling it a tool of the Chinese Communist Party — claims that Shein denies.
“No one should be fooled by Shein’s efforts to cover its tracks,” Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., wrote in a letter to other lawmakers this month.
As relations between the United States and China turn increasingly rocky, some of China’s most entrepreneurial brands have taken steps to distance themselves from their home country. They have set up new factories and headquarters outside China to serve the United States and other foreign markets, emphasized their foreign ties and scrubbed any mention of “China” from their corporate websites.
TikTok has set up headquarters in Los Angeles and Singapore, and invested in new U.S. operations that it says will wall off its U.S. user data from its parent company, ByteDance. Temu has established a headquarters in Boston, and its parent company, PDD Holdings, has moved its headquarters from China to Ireland.
Chinese solar companies have set up factories outside China to avoid U.S. tariffs on solar panels from China and limit their exposure to Xinjiang, a region that the United States now bars imports from because of its use of forced labor.
JinkoSolar, a behemoth that produces 1 in 10 solar modules installed globally, has set up a supply chain entirely outside China to make goods for the United States.
Other companies, including those that are foreign-owned, are building walls between their Chinese operations and their global businesses, judging that this is the best way to avoid running afoul of new restrictions or risks to their reputation.
Sequoia Capital, the venture capital firm, said last week that it would split its global business into three independent partnerships, spinning off unique entities for China and India.
Shein said in a statement that it was “a multinational company with diversified operations around the world and customers in 150 markets, and we make all business decisions with that in mind.” The company said it had zero tolerance for forced labor, did not source cotton from Xinjiang and fully complied with all U.S. tax and trade laws.
A spokesperson for TikTok said that the Chinese Communist Party had neither direct nor indirect control of ByteDance or TikTok, and that ByteDance was a private, global company with offices around the world.
“Roughly 60% of ByteDance is owned by global institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, and its CEO resides in Singapore,” said Brooke Oberwetter, a spokesperson.
Temu did not respond to requests for comment.
Analysts said companies were being driven out of China by a variety of motivations, including better access to foreign customers and an escape from the risk of a crackdown by the Chinese authorities.
Some companies have more practical concerns, such as reducing their costs for labor and shipping, lowering their tax bills or shedding the shoddy reputation that American buyers continue to associate with goods made in China, said Shay Luo, a principal at the consulting firm Kearney who studies supply chains.
But a wave of tougher restrictions in the United States on doing business with China appears to be having an effect, too.
Research by Altana, a supply chain technology company, shows that since 2016, new regulations, customs enforcement actions and trade policies that hurt Chinese exports to the United States were followed by “adaptive behavior,” such as setting up new subsidiaries outside China, said Evan Smith, the company’s CEO.
For Chinese companies, going global is not a new phenomenon. The Chinese government initiated a “go out” policy at the turn of the century to encourage state-owned enterprises to invest abroad to gain overseas markets, natural resources and technology.
Private companies including electronics firm Lenovo, appliance maker Haier and e-commerce giant Alibaba soon followed, seeking investment targets and new customers.
As tensions between the United States and China have risen in recent years, investment flows between the countries have slowed. U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods put in place by President Donald Trump and maintained by President Joe Biden encouraged companies to move manufacturing from China to countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Mexico. The pandemic, which halted factories in China and raised costs for moving goods across the ocean, accelerated the trend.
International companies are now increasingly adopting a “China plus one” model of securing an additional source of goods in another country in case of supply interruptions in China. Chinese companies, too, are following this practice, Luo said.
In the 12 months that ended in April, the share of imports to the United States from China reached its lowest level since 2006.
“It is definitely a rational strategy for these companies to offshore, to move manufacturing or their headquarters to a third country,” said Roselyn Hsueh, an associate professor of political science at Temple University.
In addition to tariffs and the ban on products from the Xinjiang region, the United States has imposed new restrictions on trade in technology and tougher security reviews for Chinese investments.
The Chinese government, too, is clamping down on the transfer of data and currency outside the country, and it has squashed some Chinese companies’ efforts to list their stocks on U.S. exchanges because of such concerns.
Beijing has detained and harassed top tech executives, and foreign consulting firms. And its draconian lockdowns during the pandemic made clear to businesses that they operate in China at the mercy of the government.
“Companies like Shein and TikTok move overseas both to reduce their U.S. regulatory and reputational risk, but also to reduce the likelihood that their founders and staff get intimidated or arrested by Chinese officials,” said Isaac Stone Fish, the CEO of Strategy Risks, a consultant on corporate exposure to China.
But companies such as Shein and Temu still source nearly all of their products from China, and it’s not clear that the changes the Chinese companies are making to their businesses have done much to lower the heat.
The opposition to these companies in Washington is being fueled by an incendiary combination of legitimate concerns over national security and forced labor, and the political appeal of appearing tough on China. It also appears to be driven by the opposition of certain competitors to these services, which are now some of the most downloaded apps in the United States.
In March, a group called Shut Down Shein sprang up to pressure Congress to crack down on the retailer. The group, which has hired five lobbyists with the firm Actum, declined to disclose who is funding its campaign.
In a five-hour hearing in March, lawmakers grilled TikTok’s CEO over whether it would make U.S. user data available to the Chinese government, or censor the information broadcast to young Americans. Legislation is being considered that could permanently ban the app.
Some lawmakers are arguing that JinkoSolar’s U.S.-made panels should not be eligible for government tax credits, and, for reasons that have not yet been disclosed, the company’s Florida factory was raided by customs officials last month.
State governments, which have often been more welcoming to Chinese investment, are also growing more hostile. In January, Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., blocked a deal for Ford Motor to set up a factory using technology from a Chinese battery maker, Contemporary Amperex Technology, calling it a “Trojan-horse relationship.”
A House committee set up to examine economic and security competition with China is investigating the ties that Temu and Shein have with forced labor in China, and lawmakers are calling for Shein to be audited before its IPO.
“The message of our investigation of Shein, Temu, Adidas and Nike is clear: Either ensure your supply chains are clean — no matter how difficult it is — or get out of countries like China implicated in forced labor,” Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., chair of the committee, said in a statement.
An investigation by Bloomberg in November found that some of Shein’s clothes were made with cotton grown in Xinjiang. In a statement, Shein said it had “built a four-step approach to ensure compliance” with the law, including a “code of conduct, independent audits, robust tracing technology and third-party testing.

Rothberg gently explained to him that it was not his fault he kept regaining weight every time he lost some.
“I think biology is conspiring against you,” she said. “I don’t think it’s a matter of willpower.”
Regner was not swayed. “I believe in myself,” he said. “I wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and say, ‘Are you going to do it or aren’t you?’”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The European Union is trying to assemble the building blocks to produce electric cars, but subsidies are luring companies to the United States.
European leaders complained for years that the United States was not doing enough to fight climate change. Now that the Biden administration has devoted hundreds of billions of dollars to that cause, many Europeans are complaining that the United States is going about it the wrong way.
That new critique is born of a deep fear in Germany, France, Britain and other European countries that Washington's approach will hurt the allies it ought to be working with, luring away much of the new investments in electric car and battery factories not already destined for China, South Korea and other Asian countries.
That concern is the main reason some European leaders, including Germany's second-highest-ranking official, Robert Habeck, have beaten a path to Vasteras, a city about 60 miles from Stockholm that is best known for a Viking burial mound and a Gothic cathedral.
Officials have been traveling there to court one of Europe's few homegrown battery companies, Northvolt. Led by a former Tesla executive, Northvolt is a small player in the global battery industry, but European leaders are offering it hundreds of millions of euros to build factories in Europe. Mr. Habeck visited in February to lobby the company to push ahead on its plan to build a factory near Hamburg, Germany. The company had considered postponing to invest in the United States instead.
"It's definitely attractive to be in America right now," Emma Nehrenheim, Northvolt's chief environmental officer, said in an interview last month in Vasteras. Northvolt declined to comment in detail on the discussions about the Hamburg plant, which the company committed to in May.
The tussle over Northvolt's plans is an example of the intense and, some European officials say, counterproductive competition between the United States and Europe as they try to acquire the building blocks of electric vehicle manufacturing to avoid becoming dependent on China, which dominates the battery supply chain.
Auto experts said that the tax credits and other incentives offered by President Biden's main climate policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, had siphoned some investment from Europe and put pressure on European countries to offer their own incentives.
The United States has provoked a "massive subsidy race," Cecilia Malmstrom, a former European trade commissioner, said during a panel discussion last month at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. She called on leaders to "jointly invest in the green transition and not compete against each other."
Biden officials have argued that U.S. and European policies are complementary. They have noted that the government and private money going into electric cars and batteries would lower prices for car buyers and put more emission-free vehicles on the road.
U.S. officials add that construction of battery factories and plants to process lithium and other materials is booming on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Efforts by governments to promote electric vehicles "will spur a degree of technological innovation and cost cutting that will be beneficial not only to Europe and the United States, but to the global economy and to our global effort to meet the challenge that climate change presents," Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, said in a recent interview.
The Biden administration has also been talking with European officials about allowing cars made from European battery materials and components to qualify for U.S. tax credits. And the administration has interpreted the I.R.A., which Mr. Biden signed in August, to leave room for producers in Europe and elsewhere to benefit.
"You're seeing less of a concern from Europe that those companies may be lured away from Europe to America," said Abigail Wulf, who directs the Center for Critical Minerals Strategy at SAFE, a nonprofit organization.
Still, the law has forced European leaders to put new industrial policies in place.
In March, the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, proposed the Critical Raw Materials Act, legislation to ensure supplies of lithium, nickel and other battery materials. One piece of the legislation calls for the E.U. to process at least 40 percent of the raw materials that the car industry needs within its own borders. The 27-nation alliance has also let countries provide more financial support to suppliers and manufacturers.
The money that the United States and Europe are pouring into electric vehicles will encourage sales, said Julia Poliscanova, a senior director at Transport & Environment, an advocacy group in Brussels. The legislation, which will need the approval of the European Parliament and the leaders of E.U. countries, would also bring some coherence to the fragmented policies of national governments, she said.
But Ms. Poliscanova added that European and U.S. policies risk canceling each other out. "Because everyone is scaling up at the same time, it's a zero-sum game," she said.
Business executives have complained that applying for financial aid in Europe is bureaucratic and slow. The Inflation Reduction Act, with its emphasis on tax credits, is simpler and faster, said Tom Einar Jensen, chief executive of the battery maker Freyr, which is building a factory in Mo i Rana, in northern Norway, and has plans to construct more plants in Finland and near Atlanta.
The I.R.A. has prompted "a dramatic increase in uptick in interest for batteries produced in the U.S.," Mr. Jensen said in an interview.
The future of European auto manufacturing is at stake, particularly for German companies. Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen have already lost market share in China to local automakers like BYD. Chinese automakers, including BYD and SAIC, are also making inroads in Europe. Selling cars under the British brand MG, SAIC has amassed 5 percent of the European electric vehicle market, putting it ahead of Toyota and Ford in that fast-growing segment.
European carmakers are frantically trying to build the supply chains they need to churn out electric vehicles.
In France, President Emmanuel Macron wants to convert a northern region where factory jobs have been in decline into a hub of battery production.
On Tuesday, Automotive Cells Company, a joint venture between Stellantis, Mercedes-Benz and TotalEnergies, inaugurated a factory in Billy-Berclau Douvrin, France, that aims to produce 300,000 electric batteries annually by the end of 2024. A.C.C. also plans to invest a total of 7.3 billion euros, or $ 7.8 billion, in Europe, including opening factories in Germany and in Italy, a deal sealed with 1.3 billion euros in public aid.
In Salzgitter, Germany, some 25 miles from Volkswagen's headquarters, steel beams tower above concrete foundations as excavators and dump trucks hum nearby. In a matter of months, the outlines of a battery factory have risen out of a field.
Volkswagen hopes to have battery-making machines installed before the end of the summer. By 2025, the automaker aims to produce battery cells for up to 500,000 electric vehicles a year -- a timeline that the company said was possible only because the factory was being built on land it owned.
Volkswagen is also building a factory in Ontario, but the company made the decision to do so only after the Canadian government matched U.S. incentives.
In Guben, a small city on Germany's border with Poland, Rock Tech Lithium, a Canadian company, is building a plant to process lithium ore. Mercedes has an agreement with Rock Tech to supply lithium to its battery producers.
These projects won't reach full production for several years. Recently, the Guben site was an open field. The only construction activity was a truck that dumped loads of crushed rock, making an ear-piercing screech.
Europe has some advantages, including a strong demand for electric cars: About 14 percent of new cars sold in the E.U. in the first three months of this year were battery powered, according to Schmidt Automotive Research, twice as many as in the United States.
But if Europe doesn't move quickly to aid the battery industry, "you will really lose momentum on the ground versus the North American market," said Dirk Harbecke, chief executive of Rock Tech.
Chinese battery companies have largely avoided the United States for fear of a political backlash. But Chinese battery firms have announced investments in Europe worth $ 17.5 billion since 2018, according to the Mercator Institute for China Studies and the Rhodium Group.
Political tension between Western governments and China has put German carmakers in a delicate position. They do not want to be overly dependent on Chinese supplies, but they cannot afford to displease the Chinese government.
BMW, Volkswagen and Volvo plan to buy cells from a factory in Arnstadt, Germany, run by CATL, a Chinese company that is currently the world's largest maker of electric vehicle batteries.
To balance their reliance on Chinese suppliers, European executives and leaders are keen to work with Northvolt, whose chief executive, Peter Carlsson, oversaw Tesla's supply chain for more than four years.
Northvolt wants to control all the steps of making batteries, including refining lithium and recycling old cells. That should help Europe achieve supply chain independence and ensure that batteries are produced in the most environmentally responsible way possible, said Ms. Nehrenheim, who is also a member of the Northvolt management board. "We're de-risking Europe," she said.
The company develops manufacturing techniques at its complex in Vasteras. Northvolt's first full-scale factory, at a site in Sweden 125 miles south of the Arctic Circle chosen for its abundant hydropower, is the size of the Pentagon. Northvolt also plans to build a U.S. factory, but has not yet announced a site.
Still, the company is ramping up production and is not among the world's top 10 battery suppliers, according to SNE Research, a consulting firm. And construction on its Hamburg plant is on hold until E.U. officials approve German subsidies.

A Change of Key Jars Music Lovers: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Its beloved music director, Gustavo Dudamel, is leaving for New York, and its innovative chief executive, Chad Smith, is going to Boston. Now the esteemed orchestra is pondering what's next.
One of the most significant developments in American classical music so far this century has been the ascendancy of the Los Angeles Philharmonic: a showcase of talent, inventive programming and strong finances that has become the envy of other orchestras.
But now the institution is facing one of its biggest challenges in decades.
First, Gustavo Dudamel, the orchestra's popular music director, announced that he would leave in 2026 to become the next music director of the New York Philharmonic. A few months later, Chad Smith, the Los Angeles Philharmonic's chief executive officer, who championed and drove its inventive programming, announced he was resigning to run the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He was one of the last remaining top deputies of Deborah Borda, who led the orchestra for 17 years in which it reached new heights before she left as its chief executive six years ago to take over the New York Philharmonic.
When Frank Gehry, the architect who designed the Los Angeles orchestra's futuristic steel-clad home, Walt Disney Concert Hall, first heard the news that Smith was leaving, he initially said, quite bluntly, that he was "scared" by the double hit of departures. But he then explained that he remained hopeful, given the orchestra's track record of successful reinvention.
"I've been through it," Gehry said. "It's a moving thing that continues to grow and change. That's the way of that world. Change has been the M.O. of orchestras around the world."
Dudamel, who noted that he would remain in his post in Los Angeles for three more seasons, said he was certain the orchestra would find the right person to lead it, and praised its "very, very, very solid executive team."
"I'm not even zero percent worried -- even zero percent," he said.
The Los Angeles Philharmonic does have a decades-long history of finding talent. Ernest Fleischmann, who led the orchestra from 1969 to 1998, revitalized its lucrative summer programming at the Hollywood Bowl, fought to build Disney Hall and hired a young Esa-Pekka Salonen to be its music director. Borda built on those successes, opening the hall, hiring Dudamel, fostering ties with the city and championing new music. The board exudes confidence that it will be able to find the right leadership again.
"It would have been a much bigger blow in other organizations that weren't as cohesive and well run and didn't have such an experienced team," said David Bohnett, a longtime member of its board of directors.
In truth, the Philharmonic has hardly been tested like this before. Borda, Smith and Dudamel have all helped shape the Los Angeles Philharmonic into a pioneering and revered institution. Dudamel is highly popular with his orchestra and the audience: His name on the roster at Walt Disney Hall or at the Philharmonic's summer venue, the Hollywood Bowl, assures big crowds, almost regardless of what is being played.
On Thursday night, returning to Disney Hall for the first time since February, Dudamel walked out to shouts and cheers to conduct world premieres by Ellen Reid and Gabriella Smith, and left two hours later to a prolonged standing ovation after leading the Philharmonic in Beethoven's Seventh Symphony.
The upheaval for what has been described as "the most important orchestra in America" has rattled some. "It's quite the moment," said Brian Lauritzen, the host and producer of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's nationally syndicated radio broadcasts on KUSC, a classical music station here. "There's definitely uncertainty. It's a watershed moment for the organization."
Some orchestra members said they were unnerved, too, but others -- including those who have lived through such changes before -- said they welcomed a new chapter. Christopher Still, who has played the trumpet with the Los Angeles Philharmonic since 2007, said that when Salonen left, "we all thought, 'What is going to happen? Who is this kid from Venezuela?' And look what happened."
"The L.A. Phil has always been on the leading edge of taking chances," Still said. "We jump and build a helicopter after we jump. This time we are doing it without a leader."
The decision by Dudamel to leave for New York startled some in the organization, but it could hardly have come as a complete surprise. There had long been rumors that Borda, who has a close relationship with Dudamel, would try to recruit him to New York. Dudamel is 42 years old, and will have been at the Los Angeles Philharmonic for 17 years by the time he decamps for New York, a long tenure.
But by every account, Smith's departure was unexpected. Smith had told associates he was reluctant to commit to another five years in Los Angeles and to search for someone to replace Dudamel, with whom he was close. And he is from the East Coast, which is where his family still lives.
Some musicians said they were disappointed to see Smith go.
"I'm super-bummed Chad is leaving," said Minor L. Wetzel, a violist, calling the news "a punch in the gut."
Smith, for his part, said he did not believe he was leaving the orchestra in a vulnerable position.
"Periods of change are periods when organizations can be thoughtful and introspective about who they want to be and make decisions that are not just a continuation of what we've done," he said.
Ara Guzelimian, a longtime arts administrator, said that even though Smith's departure was a shock, it could benefit the institution in the long run.
"There is a logic to the timing, if he was beginning to feel his effectiveness and his shelf date were coming to a close," he said. "There is a kind of precise professional sell-by date where both you need renewal and the organization needs renewal. My guess is that he began to hear the professional ticking clock."
The first order of business will be to appoint a new chief executive to run the orchestra and oversee the search for a new music director. The fact that Dudamel is not leaving for three years provides some breathing room.
"They can take their time," Salonen said. "They have a very strong body of guest conductors," and Dudamel still has more seasons to go, he added. "So it's not a crisis by any means."
Thomas L. Beckmen, the chairman of the board of directors, said a committee has been appointed to find a replacement for Smith, and that he was hopeful the search would be finished in time for Smith's successor to help choose Dudamel's successor.
It will be a challenge: Board members said there was a relatively small pool of experienced music executives to draw from. "It isn't that deep," Beckmen said in an interview. "I started virtually looking at the top 25 orchestras in the U.S. and there's not a lot of strength. But there are a few, and I think L.A. is a pretty prestigious job these days."
But these kind of searches are always complicated and risky, given the tightly knit and competitive world of American orchestras. It took nearly a year to replace Borda -- and that choice, Simon Woods, who came to Los Angeles from the Seattle Symphony, stepped down abruptly 18 months after he began. That paved the way for the appointment of Smith, who was then the chief operating officer.
"When you have leadership changes, there's anxiety and uncertainty -- that's normal," said Thomas W. Morris, a veteran orchestra administrator.
Morris said the priority for the Philharmonic should be to find a chief executive "very expeditiously" to manage the transition.
"They need somebody who has a sense of what an orchestra is in relationship to a community and what an orchestra can be artistically," he said.
Some board members were optimistic, saying they expected considerable interest in the music director job. "Look at the people that the L.A. Phil has found over the past 60 years," said Reveta Bowers, a member of the board of directors. "The kind of diversity that exists in the L.A. market -- the Philharmonic, the Hollywood Bowl, the Ford Theater, the different kinds of genres at Disney Hall. This is a dream job."
The board has appointed Daniel Song, the chief operating officer, to serve as interim chief executive officer. Beckmen said the board would retain a consultant to help find a permanent replacement for Smith; the new music director will be chosen, with the ratification of the board, by a committee made up of two musicians, two members of the board of directors, and two executives from the organization.
Beckmen said the long line of successful music directors, going back half a century, made him confident about the next chapter. "We've been very fortunate," he said. "Hopefully the sun will shine on us again."

U.S. Will Require New Cars To Have Automatic Brakes: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The top federal auto safety regulator on Wednesday proposed requiring all new cars and trucks to have automatic braking systems that can prevent collisions, after traffic fatalities have soared in recent years.
The plan, from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, would require car companies to expand the use of more advanced systems than those commonly in use now. The agency is proposing that all light vehicles, including cars, large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, be equipped to automatically stop and avoid hitting pedestrians at speeds of up to 37 miles per hour.
Vehicles would also have to brake and stop to avoid hitting stopped or slow-moving vehicles at speeds of up to 62 m.p.h. And the systems would have to perform well at night.
"We hope this will avoid many crashes," Polly Trottenberg, a deputy transportation secretary, said at a news conference. "We know this is going to save lives."
About 90 percent of the new vehicles on sale now have some form of automatic emergency braking, but not all meet the standards the safety agency is proposing.
Ms. Trottenberg acknowledged that the rule would impose costs on automakers, which have often resisted new regulations. "I know we're throwing a challenge out here, but we also know this technology is pretty well developed," she said. "This is the time to take things to the next level."
Auto safety experts have pointed to several factors in the rise in traffic deaths, including the larger size and heavier weight of cars and trucks and greater distraction because drivers and pedestrians are increasingly using electronic devices. In some places, roads have been designed and lighted to keep traffic moving rather than to protect pedestrians and cyclists.
Jonathan Adkins, chief executive of the Governors Highway Safety Association, welcomed the proposal. "We certainly want to see it implemented as soon as possible," he said.
The technology could help reduce fatal accidents.
Traffic fatalities are one of the most persistent causes of death in the United States, and they are increasing despite advances such as warning and crash avoidance systems, and increasing airbag use. Nearly 43,000 people died in auto crashes in 2022. That was down slightly from 2021, but 31 percent higher than in 2014.
Traffic deaths had been declining until about a decade ago, when they began rising rapidly. The rise has been driven by a spike in pedestrian deaths. An estimated 3,500 pedestrians were killed in the first half of 2022, the most recent period for which data is available. That is the highest number in 40 years.
The toll goes beyond fatalities. In 2019, the economic cost of auto crashes totaled $ 340 billion, according to the safety agency. In that year, 36,500 people died in auto accidents, 4.5 million were injured and 23 million vehicles were damaged.
Government officials said the automatic-braking proposal could save at least 360 lives a year and reduce injuries by about 24,000 a year. Even when automatic braking doesn't prevent crashes, it can make accidents less severe by slowing down cars.
Braking systems use radar or cameras to anticipate accidents.
Automatic emergency braking systems typically use cameras, radar or both to spot vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and other obstacles. By comparing a vehicle's speed and direction with those of other vehicles or people, these systems can determine that a collision is imminent, alert the driver through an alarm and activate the brakes if the driver fails to do so.
The first such systems were introduced in 2011. Five years later, automakers voluntarily agreed to make automatic emergency braking technology standard in all new cars and trucks by 2022. The agency said its proposed rule would impose higher standards than the technology that automakers had agreed to use.
In a statement, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the industry's main lobbying group, did not endorse or oppose the proposed rule, calling automatic braking a "breakthrough technology" that automakers "have already deployed."
Automatic braking is one component of advanced driver-assistance systems that are found in some new cars. These systems are capable of steering without human intervention and, in some cases, changing lanes and allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel on highways. These systems include Tesla's Autopilot, Super Cruise by General Motors and BlueCruise from Ford Motor.
The federal safety agency has been investigating Tesla's system after it appears to have failed to identify and spot other vehicles in some situations. The agency is looking at 43 crashes, including 14 in which 18 people were killed, that occurred while Autopilot or another system that the company calls Full Self-Driving were activated.
It could take a few years before the rules go into effect.
The safety agency will take comments on the rule from automakers, safety groups and the public before making it final -- a process that can take a year or more. The rule will go into effect three years after it is adopted.
On Tuesday, President Biden withdrew the nomination of Ann E. Carlson to lead the agency. Some Republican senators had opposed her appointment because of her past work on environmental policy. Previously a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, Ms. Carlson has been the agency's acting administrator since September.

VASTERAS, Sweden — European leaders complained for years that the United States was not doing enough to fight climate change. Now that the Biden administration has devoted hundreds of billions of dollars to that cause, many Europeans are complaining that the United States is going about it the wrong way.
That new critique is born of a deep fear in Germany, France, Britain and other European countries that Washington’s approach will hurt the allies it ought to be working with, luring away much of the new investments in electric car and battery factories not already destined for China, South Korea and other Asian countries.
That concern is the main reason some European leaders, including Germany’s second highest ranking official, Robert Habeck, have beaten a path to Vasteras, a city about 60 miles from Stockholm that is best known for a Viking burial mound and a Gothic cathedral.
Officials have been traveling there to court one of Europe’s few homegrown battery companies, Northvolt. Led by a former Tesla executive, Northvolt is a small player in the global battery industry, but European leaders are offering it hundreds of millions of euros to build factories in Europe. Habeck visited in February to lobby the company to push ahead on its plan to build a factory near Hamburg, Germany. The company had considered postponing to invest in the United States instead.
“It’s definitely attractive to be in America right now,” Emma Nehrenheim, Northvolt’s chief environmental officer, said in an interview last month in Vasteras. Northvolt declined to comment in detail on the discussions about the Hamburg plant, which the company committed to in May.
The tussle over Northvolt’s plans is an example of the intense and, some European officials say, counterproductive competition between the United States and Europe as they try to acquire the building blocks of electric vehicle manufacturing to avoid becoming dependent on China, which dominates the battery supply chain.
Auto experts said the tax credits and other incentives offered by President Joe Biden’s main climate policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, had siphoned some investment from Europe and put pressure on European countries to offer their own incentives.
The United States has provoked a “massive subsidy race,” Cecilia Malmstrom, a former European trade commissioner, said during a panel discussion last month at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. She called on leaders to “jointly invest in the green transition and not compete against each other.”
Biden officials have argued that U.S. and European policies are complementary. They have noted that the government and private money going into electric cars and batteries would lower prices for car buyers and put more emission-free vehicles on the road.
U.S. officials add that construction of battery factories and plants to process lithium and other materials is booming on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Efforts by governments to promote electric vehicles “will spur a degree of technological innovation and cost cutting that will be beneficial not only to Europe and the United States, but to the global economy and to our global effort to meet the challenge that climate change presents,” Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, said in a recent interview.
The Biden administration has also been talking with European officials about allowing cars made with European battery materials and components to qualify for U.S. tax credits. And the administration has interpreted the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed in August, to leave room for producers in Europe and elsewhere to benefit.
“You’re seeing less of a concern from Europe that those companies may be lured away from Europe to America,” said Abigail Wulf, who directs the Center for Critical Minerals Strategy at SAFE, a nonprofit organization.
Still, the U.S. law has forced European leaders to put new industrial policies in place.
In March, the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, proposed the Critical Raw Materials Act, legislation to ensure supplies of lithium, nickel and other battery materials. One piece of the legislation calls for the EU to process at least 40% of the raw materials that the car industry needs within its own borders. The 27-nation alliance has also let countries provide more financial support to suppliers and manufacturers.
The money that the United States and Europe are pouring into electric vehicles will encourage sales, said Julia Poliscanova, a senior director at Transport & Environment, an advocacy group in Brussels. The legislation, which will need the approval of the European Parliament and the leaders of EU countries, would also bring some coherence to the fragmented policies of national governments, she said.
But Poliscanova added that European and U.S. policies risk canceling each other out. “Because everyone is scaling up at the same time, it’s a zero-sum game,” she said.
Business executives have complained that applying for financial aid in Europe is bureaucratic and slow. The Inflation Reduction Act, with its emphasis on tax credits, is simpler and faster, said Tom Einar Jensen, chief executive of the battery maker Freyr, which is building a factory in Mo i Rana, in northern Norway, and has plans to construct more plants in Finland and near Atlanta.
The Inflation Reduction Act has prompted “a dramatic increase in uptick in interest for batteries produced in the U.S.,” Jensen said in an interview.
The future of European auto manufacturing is at stake, particularly for German companies. Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen have already lost market share in China to local automakers like BYD. Chinese automakers, including BYD and SAIC, are also making inroads in Europe. Selling cars under the British brand MG, SAIC has amassed 5% of the European electric vehicle market, putting it ahead of Toyota and Ford in that fast-growing segment.
European carmakers are frantically trying to build the supply chains they need to churn out electric vehicles.
In France, President Emmanuel Macron wants to convert a northern region where factory jobs have been in decline into a hub of battery production.
On Tuesday, Automotive Cells Co., a joint venture between Stellantis, Mercedes-Benz and TotalEnergies, inaugurated a factory in Billy-Berclau Douvrin, France, that aims to produce 300,000 electric batteries annually by the end of 2024. ACC also plans to invest a total of 7.3 billion euros, or $7.8 billion, in Europe, including opening factories in Germany and in Italy, a deal sealed with 1.3 billion euros in public aid.
In Salzgitter, Germany, some 25 miles from Volkswagen’s headquarters, steel beams tower above concrete foundations as excavators and dump trucks hum nearby. In a matter of months, the outlines of a battery factory have risen out of a field.
Volkswagen hopes to have battery-making machines installed before the end of the summer. By 2025, the automaker aims to produce battery cells for up to 500,000 electric vehicles a year — a timeline that the company said was possible only because the factory was being built on land it owned.
Volkswagen is also building a factory in Ontario, but the company made the decision to do so only after the Canadian government matched U.S. incentives.
In Guben, a small city on Germany’s border with Poland, Rock Tech Lithium, a Canadian company, is building a plant to process lithium ore. Mercedes has an agreement with Rock Tech to supply lithium to its battery producers.
These projects won’t reach full production for several years. Recently, the Guben site was an open field. The only construction activity was a truck that dumped loads of crushed rock, making an ear-piercing screech.
Europe has some advantages, including a strong demand for electric cars: About 14% of new cars sold in the EU in the first three months of this year were battery powered, according to Schmidt Automotive Research, twice as many as in the United States.
But if Europe doesn’t move quickly to aid the battery industry, “you will really lose momentum on the ground versus the North American market,” said Dirk Harbecke, chief executive of Rock Tech.
Chinese battery companies have largely avoided the United States for fear of a political backlash. But Chinese battery firms have announced investments in Europe worth $17.5 billion since 2018, according to the Mercator Institute for China Studies and the Rhodium Group.
Political tension between Western governments and China has put German carmakers in a delicate position. They do not want to be overly dependent on Chinese supplies, but they cannot afford to displease the Chinese government.
BMW, Volkswagen and Volvo plan to buy cells from a factory in Arnstadt, Germany, run by CATL, a Chinese company that is currently the world’s largest maker of electric vehicle batteries.
To balance their reliance on Chinese suppliers, European executives and leaders are keen to work with Northvolt, whose chief executive, Peter Carlsson, oversaw Tesla’s supply chain for more than four years.
Northvolt wants to control all the steps of making batteries, including refining lithium and recycling old cells. That should help Europe achieve supply chain independence and ensure that batteries are produced in the most environmentally responsible way possible, said Nehrenheim, who is also a member of the Northvolt management board. “We’re de-risking Europe,” she said.
The company develops manufacturing techniques at its complex in Vasteras. Northvolt’s first full-scale factory, at a site in Sweden 125 miles south of the Arctic Circle chosen for its abundant hydropower, is the size of the Pentagon. Northvolt also plans to build a U.S. factory, but has not yet announced a site.
Still, the company is ramping up production and is not among the world’s top 10 battery suppliers, according to SNE Research, a consulting firm. And construction on its Hamburg plant is on hold until EU officials approve German subsidies.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The disgraced founder of the blood testing start-up Theranos, who was convicted of fraud, turned herself in at a minimum-security prison in Texas.
Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced entrepreneur who was convicted of defrauding investors at her failed blood testing start-up, Theranos, reported to a federal prison in Texas on Tuesday to begin her 11-year, three-month sentence.
Ms. Holmes surrendered to F.P.C. Bryan, a minimum-security prison camp for women roughly 90 minutes from Houston. She pulled up in a Ford Expedition that appeared to be driven by her mother, Noel Holmes. Her father, Christian Holmes, appeared to be inside.
After some shuffling around, out of the view of the cameras gathered nearby, Elizabeth Holmes entered the facility wearing jeans, glasses and a sweater, and carrying some papers. As she entered the prison, a bystander watching from the street yelled her name.
F.P.C. Bryan's 655 inmates are required to work in the cafeteria or in a manufacturing facility, where pay starts at $ 1.15 an hour, according to the prison's handbook. Before starting work at the factory, Ms. Holmes may take a test to assess her strengths in areas such as business, clerical, numerical, logic, mechanical and "social." Inmates can also enroll in a "Lean Six Sigma" training program to learn about efficiency.
"We try to help our ladies obtain work in the factory which focuses on their strengths so they may develop additional marketable skills," the prison's handbook says.
Ms. Holmes, 39, was found guilty last year of four counts of wire fraud and conspiracy for falsely claiming that Theranos's blood tests could detect a variety of ailments with just a few drops of blood. She and her former business partner, Ramesh Balwani, must together pay $ 452 million in restitution to investors who were defrauded. Ms. Holmes has appealed her case, though her requests to remain out of prison during the appeal have been denied.
Ms. Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 after dropping out of Stanford University at age 19. The company raised $ 950 million in funding, making her a billionaire on paper. Theranos collapsed in 2018. Ms. Holmes and Mr. Balwani were indicted that year.
The pair were tried separately. Mr. Balwani was convicted on 12 counts of fraud and is serving a nearly 13-year sentence in a federal prison in San Pedro, Calif. He has also appealed his case.
Ms. Holmes's sentence was meant to send a message to others in Silicon Valley: There are consequences when ambitious start-up founders take an ethos known as "fake it till you make it" -- when entrepreneurs speak ambitiously about what their companies can do, even if the companies can't yet do those things -- too far. Despite the tech industry's long history of stretching the rules, as entrepreneurs invent new businesses and disrupt old ones, few have ever gone to prison for lying.
Since her conviction, Ms. Holmes has been living in a rental home in San Diego near the family of Billy Evans, who is the father of her two children. During her trial, held in San Jose, Calif., Ms. Holmes and Mr. Evans lived in a home on the grounds of Green Gables, a $ 135 million estate in the wealthy town of Woodside.
Their two young children, William and Invicta, will be able to conduct video calls with Ms. Holmes and visit her on weekends and federal holidays. Phone calls are limited to 15 minutes each, with a total of 300 minutes per month.
At F.P.C. Bryan, Ms. Holmes, known for wearing black turtlenecks to mimic Steve Jobs while running Theranos and, during her trial, sporting heels, sheath dresses and a diaper bag, will wear prison-issued khaki pants and shirts in pastel green, gray or white with athletic shoes that must not exceed $ 100 in value.
She will not have any internet access but can buy a radio ( $ 31.75) or an MP3 player ( $ 88.40) from the commissary. All music must be "non-explicit," according to the prison's handbook.
F.P.C. Bryan offers leisure activities including music programs, "table games" and movies, according to its handbook. Arts and crafts are available, including beading, knitting, paper art, crochet and ceramics. A crochet needle costs $ 1.30 and yarn is $ 3.55 at F.P.C. Bryan's commissary, according to the handbook.
Inmates have access to an outdoor "recreation yard pavilion" but must return to their dorms for head counts that occur five times every 24 hours.
Counterfeiting or forging documents and conducting a business are against the rules. Ms. Holmes admitted to falsifying pharmaceutical reports to solicit investors while testifying in her trial.
Other inmates at the prison camp include Jen Shah, a "Real Housewives of Salt Lake City" star who is serving a five-and-a-half-year sentence for wire fraud related to telemarketing. In a blog post from March about her first few days in prison, Ms. Shah described difficulty operating the phone system, which uses account numbers, and noted that not many people were nice. Breakfast was instant oatmeal, an apple and a slice of wheat bread with jelly, she wrote.
Lea Fastow, a former executive for the collapsed energy company Enron, was incarcerated for tax fraud at F.P.C. Bryan for 11 months in the mid-2000s. Jenna Ryan, a participant in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, spent 60 days there. And Michelle Janavs, daughter of a Hot Pockets co-founder, served five months for her association with the "Operation Varsity Blues" college admissions scandal.
Three inmates escaped F.P.C. Bryan in 2017. One of them, Edith Lara, who was serving time for drug charges, has not been found, according to the Bureau of Prisons website.

How Small Town's Tragedy Fueled a Rush to Rage: [Correction]

Author: Homans, Charles; Bensinger, Ken

Abstract: None available.

Full text: There were no known witnesses when Shannon Brandt and Cayler Ellingson got into an argument in the blurry hours after last call at Buck's n Doe's Bar & Grill in September. And no one but Mr. Brandt could say with certainty what led him to run over Mr. Ellingson with his Ford Explorer, crushing him to death in a gravel alley.
But the people of McHenry, a town of 64 in sparsely populated Foster County, N.D., have gotten used to hearing from people who think they know.
They include former President Donald J. Trump, who denounced the killing of Mr. Ellingson, an 18-year-old recent high school graduate, at the hands of a "deranged Democrat maniac who was angry that Cayler was a Republican" in a Truth Social post. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia described Mr. Brandt on Twitter as a "Democrat political terrorist" and cited the case as evidence that "Democrats want Republicans dead, and they've already started the killings."
Mr. Trump and Ms. Greene were among a chorus of Republican politicians -- including several members of Congress and the attorney general of North Dakota -- who rushed to condemn Mr. Brandt. They relied on a handful of early news stories that cited a state highway patrol officer's report, which suggested Mr. Brandt killed Mr. Ellingson because he believed he was a "Republican extremist."
That claim, made weeks before the midterm elections, ignited a brief national political firestorm. Republican politicians and right-wing media figures claimed that Mr. Brandt had been inspired by President Biden's recent warnings about "extremism" in the Republican Party. They complained that news media coverage of political violence willfully ignored instances when the assailants were Democrats.
But the episode quickly became an example of another media phenomenon: the distortion of complex, painful events to fit an opportune political narrative.
Although evidence in the case suggests the two men argued about politics that night, law enforcement officials concluded quickly that the killing was not politically motivated. The prosecutor for Foster County who brought the charges never accused Mr. Brandt of running over Mr. Ellingson because of political beliefs.
Acquaintances and a family member could not recall Mr. Brandt, a 42-year-old welder with no history of party affiliation, expressing political views.
Late last month, the murder charge against Mr. Brandt was downgraded to manslaughter, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. He agreed on May 18 to plead guilty.
By averting a courtroom trial, the plea leaves many questions hanging over a still largely unexplained incident -- and over a town that found itself swept abruptly into a national political cyclone and just as abruptly cast out.
In conversations this month, residents of McHenry -- a conservative, close-knit agricultural community where most families, including the Ellingsons and the Brandts, have known each other for decades, if not generations -- said the narrative of the tragedy that Mr. Trump and others promoted never made much sense to them. But except for a handful of county officials, they have shied away from speaking on the record about it.
Robyn Sorum, the mayor of McHenry, said that she had advised the community against doing so to avoid worsening local tensions around the case. "Anywhere something like this happens, it's a tragedy, you know?" she said. "But then you get to a small town where everyone knows each other, it makes it even rougher."
Mr. Ellingson's family did not comment. Mr. Brandt, through his attorney, Mark Friese, declined an interview.
Mr. Friese, who did not discuss details of the incident, described the aftermath as a cautionary tale. "I think we're going to see more of this," he said. "Things end up being tried on social media instead of in the courtroom."
A confusing encounter
The town of McHenry sits on a crosshatch of gravel roads etched into an undulating plain of wheat and soybean farms and Angus cattle ranches. The nearest landmarks of any significance, a 30- and 60-minute drive away, respectively, are a decommissioned intercontinental ballistic missile silo and the world's largest concrete buffalo.
"It's a nice little town," said Ms. Sorum, who is also the proprietor of the Hunting Shack cafe, the only business besides Buck's n Doe's on the town's main thoroughfare. "Everybody tries to help everybody else."
On the night of Sept. 17, a hundred or so people from McHenry and surrounding towns gathered outside of Buck's n Doe's for McHenry Days, a local festival. After midnight, when a three-piece country band from Fargo packed up and went home, some of the festival goers drifted into the bar.
The crowd included Mr. Ellingson, who had come to the festival with his family and stayed behind with his brother after their parents drove back to nearby Grace City. And it included Mr. Brandt, who came from a locally prominent family that had lived in McHenry since the early 20th century. His father and uncle had shot the immense trophy elks that looked down upon patrons from the walls of the bar.
Buck's n Doe's closed at 2 a.m. Fifty-five minutes later, the county 911 dispatcher received a call from Mr. Brandt. "I hit a man with my vehicle," he said in the recording of the call.
At the time, Mr. Ellingson was alive and conscious but badly injured. He died later that morning at a hospital.
The next day, two Fargo television stations reported that a sworn declaration from a highway patrol officer said that Mr. Brandt had claimed Mr. Ellingson "was part of a Republican extremist group" and admitted to hitting the teen with his car "because he had a political argument" with him. The highway patrolman's statement was based on a recording of the 911 call and an interview of Mr. Brandt by two other law enforcement officers.
But the declaration appears to have mischaracterized the 911 call. And the prosecutor never presented evidence that showed Mr. Brandt told officers that he ran into the teen because of the argument or that he believed he was part of an extremist group. Five days after the incident, a captain in the North Dakota State Highway Patrol told reporters that his agency had concluded the killing was "not political in nature at all."
Subsequent court filings and testimony instead revealed a murkier, more confused encounter.
In phone calls, Mr. Brandt and Mr. Ellingson both made a reference to some sort of political dispute. Both called family members during the encounter, and each described feeling threatened, according to court records.
Mr. Ellingson told his mother "some politics had got brought up" and Mr. Brandt "didn't like what he had to say," according to a state Bureau of Criminal Investigation agent who interviewed Mr. Ellingson's mother. She recalled her son saying "something to the effect of, 'They're on to me. I should round up my cousins or my posse,"' the agent testified.
In his 911 call after he hit Mr. Ellingson, Mr. Brandt said the teenager had said "something about some Republican extremist group," but he did not claim Mr. Ellingson was a member. Mr. Brandt told the dispatcher he believed the teen was "calling other guys to come get me." There's no evidence Mr. Ellingson did so.
In the 911 call, Mr. Brandt described trying to leave in a panic only to be blocked by Mr. Ellingson. At one point he said he knew his running over Mr. Ellingson had been "more than" an accident. But he otherwise insisted the act had been unintentional. "I never meant to hurt him," he told the dispatcher.
Both men were intoxicated. Mr. Brandt's family and Mr. Friese say Mr. Brandt has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, which Mr. Friese argued was a relevant factor in the case. An autopsy by the state forensic medical examiner ruled the cause of death as "accidental."
'Politically motivated'
In the days after the episode, several local news outlets published articles. As is typical with early reports, those first stories relied heavily on the sparse details provided by law enforcement records.
"Man admits to killing teen after political dispute in Foster Co., court docs allege," was the headline published online by Valley News Live, a news outlet based in Fargo, the day after Mr. Ellingson's death.
The next morning, Gateway Pundit, a right-wing site that regularly seeds stories in the conservative media, wrote its own version under the headline "Crazed North Dakota man runs over and kills teen for 'extremist' Republican views."
That evening, the case hit Fox News's prime-time lineup, where it stayed for days. "This is a guy who intended to kill an 18-year-old Republican because he was a Republican," Jeanine Pirro said during an on-air debate about the incident, claiming that Mr. Brandt chased Mr. Ellingson in his vehicle.
Ms. Pirro blamed Mr. Biden, who she said "is the one who started this extremist hate" when he made a speech about the perils of far-right extremism earlier that month. On Twitter, Ms. Greene posted a clip of Mr. Biden referencing "extreme MAGA Republicans," adding that Mr. Ellingson was "executed in cold blood by a Democrat political terrorist because of rhetoric like this."
The case spread across the right-wing ecosystem, from Jack Posobiec, the far-right conspiracy theorist and podcaster, to Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, who appeared on Laura Ingraham's Fox News show, calling Mr. Brandt a "terrible guy." The state attorney general, Drew H. Wrigley, condemned the episode as "hateful violence."
In McHenry and the neighboring town of Glenfield, where Mr. Brandt lives, acquaintances said they were surprised by the claims of a political motive. There is no evidence in public records or court filings suggesting Mr. Brandt is a Democrat.
"I can honestly tell you, I don't know who Shannon voted for in the last presidential election," Ashley Brandt-Duda, Mr. Brandt's sister, said in an interview. "I would say my family is quite apolitical," she added.
Mr. Brandt's reference to extremists was similarly met with surprise in McHenry, where both residents and law enforcement officials profess to know little about such groups. The county sheriff's records do mention one previously unreported incident: In October, a long-shuttered local school was found to have been vandalized, its interior walls spray-painted with the stenciled logo of Patriot Front, a white nationalist group.
The building's owner, David Ludwig, initially told a sheriff's deputy that the break-in happened the weekend of Mr. Ellingson's killing. But when reached by The Times, he said that timing was just a guess. Justin Johnson, the Foster County sheriff, said he considered the incident to be "totally unrelated."
Nothing on public record suggests that Mr. Ellingson or Mr. Brandt had links to extremist groups.
'Everything just exploded'
In the week and a half after Mr. Ellingson's death, the case was discussed on at least seven Fox News shows. The coverage continued well after law enforcement officials had said the killing was not politically motivated, a point that was only occasionally mentioned on-air.
Ms. Brandt-Duda said her parents left their home in McHenry out of concern for their safety. When they returned about a week later, they found more than 50 threatening messages on their answering machine.
They received numerous threatening letters, too, Ms. Brandt-Duda said. One was written on the margins of an article about the incident from The New York Post, she said. The newspaper covered the case extensively and also published an opinion column arguing that the "president of the United States, supported by a fan-girl media, spouts irresponsible rhetoric that led to Ellingson's death."
"Everything just exploded," Ms. Brandt-Duda said.
The county court and sheriff's offices also received numerous threats, according to multiple local officials. On Sept. 29, 11 days after Mr. Ellingson's death, the county prosecutor, Kara Brinster, dropped the initial charge of vehicular homicide, which is used for fatal drunken driving accidents, for a new one: intentional homicide, which carries a sentence of up to life in prison.
Ms. Brinster did not respond to requests for comment on the decision.
Then, as quickly as it swelled, the media frenzy receded. Fox Digital, the TV network's online arm, continued to publish articles that acknowledged the more complicated story that was emerging from officials. But Fox News's hosts did not mention the case on-air again after Sept. 30.
Asked for comment, a Fox spokeswoman, Jessica Ketner, noted the company's online articles but did not comment on the network's television coverage.
Gateway Pundit, too, stopped publishing stories on the case. Politicians who had been quick to speak out appeared to lose interest. Mr. Trump, Ms. Greene, Mr. Jordan and Mr. Wrigley, the North Dakota attorney general, did not respond to requests for comment.
Earlier this month, after Ms. Brinster dismissed the intentional homicide charge, the decision merited little more attention than a front-page story in The Foster County Independent and an article by The Associated Press.
But just as Mr. Brandt agreed to plead guilty, Mr. Posobiec, the right-wing podcaster, took up the story again. In a segment on his daily show, he singled out the prosecutor, claiming she had gone soft on Mr. Brandt. He posted her photograph and phone number online, and told listeners to call her to complain.
"Maybe Kara Brinster should be prosecuted," he said. "Maybe we should look into her."

McHENRY, N.D. — There were no known witnesses when Shannon Brandt and Cayler Ellingson got into an argument in the blurry hours after last call at Buck’s n Doe’s Bar & Grill in September. And no one but Brandt could say with certainty what led him to run over Ellingson with his Ford Explorer, crushing him to death in a gravel alley.
But the people of McHenry, a town of 64 in sparsely populated Foster County, North Dakota, have gotten used to hearing from people who think they know.
They include former President Donald Trump, who denounced the killing of Ellingson, an 18-year-old recent high school graduate, at the hands of a “deranged Democrat maniac who was angry that Cayler was a Republican” in a Truth Social post. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia described Brandt on Twitter as a “Democrat political terrorist” and cited the case as evidence that “Democrats want Republicans dead, and they’ve already started the killings.”
Trump and Greene were among a chorus of Republican politicians — including several members of Congress and the attorney general of North Dakota — who rushed to condemn Brandt. They relied on a handful of early news stories that cited a state highway patrol officer’s report, which suggested Brandt killed Ellingson because he believed he was a “Republican extremist.”
That claim, made weeks before the midterm elections, ignited a brief national political firestorm. Republican politicians and right-wing media figures claimed that Brandt had been inspired by President Joe Biden’s recent warnings about “extremism” in the Republican Party. They complained that news media coverage of political violence willfully ignored instances when the assailants were Democrats.
But the episode quickly became an example of another media phenomenon: the distortion of complex, painful events to fit an opportune political narrative.
Although evidence in the case suggests the two men argued about politics that night, law enforcement officials concluded quickly that the killing was not politically motivated. The prosecutor for Foster County who brought the charges never accused Brandt of running over Ellingson because of political beliefs.
Acquaintances and a family member could not recall Brandt, a 42-year-old welder with no history of party registration, expressing political views.
Late last month, the murder charge against Brandt was downgraded to manslaughter, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. He agreed on May 18 to plead guilty.
By averting a courtroom trial, the plea leaves many questions hanging over a still largely unexplained incident — and over a town that found itself swept abruptly into a national political cyclone and just as abruptly cast out.
In conversations this month, residents of McHenry — a conservative, close-knit agricultural community where most families, including the Ellingsons and the Brandts, have known each other for decades, if not generations — said the narrative of the tragedy that Trump and others promoted never made much sense to them. But except for a handful of county officials, they have shied away from speaking on the record about it.
Robyn Sorum, the mayor of McHenry, said she had advised the community against doing so to avoid worsening local tensions around the case. “Anywhere something like this happens, it’s a tragedy, you know?” she said. “But then you get to a small town where everyone knows each other, it makes it even rougher.”
Ellingson’s family did not comment. Brandt, through his attorney, Mark Friese, declined an interview.
Friese, who did not discuss details of the incident, described the aftermath as a cautionary tale. “I think we’re going to see more of this,” he said. “Things end up being tried on social media instead of in the courtroom.”
A Confusing Encounter
The town of McHenry sits on a crosshatch of gravel roads etched into an undulating plain of wheat and soybean farms and Angus cattle ranches. The nearest landmarks of any significance, a 30- and 60-minute drive away, respectively, are a decommissioned intercontinental ballistic missile silo and the world’s largest concrete buffalo.
“It’s a nice little town,” said Sorum, who is also the proprietor of the Hunting Shack cafe, the only business besides Buck’s n Doe’s on the town’s main thoroughfare. “Everybody tries to help everybody else.”
On the night of Sept. 17, 100 or so people from McHenry and surrounding towns gathered outside of Buck’s n Doe’s for McHenry Days, a local festival. After midnight, when a three-piece country band from Fargo packed up and went home, some of the festival goers drifted into the bar.

Riding Along on Spain's El Rocío Pilgrimage: [Travel Desk]

Full text: "You can't wear that flamenco dress for the El Rocío pilgrimage, Bonita," Maria Cárdenas, our Airbnb host, said with a laugh. "You'll die in the heat."
She pinched the thick red fabric between her thumb and held it up to my face like a specimen. "You see? Heavy tight dresses like this are made for the festivals at the bullring in Seville city," she explained. "You need lightweight stretchy polyester for pilgrimages -- for riding, walking, dancing, siestas in the grass."
The El Rocío pilgrimage is a high-octane religious spectacle -- a multiday annual fiesta, held in Andalusia, the southernmost region in Spain -- of flamenco dresses, caravans and religious fervor that seems to grow ever stronger, despite the ever-waning influence of the Catholic Church.
Participants can spend months in preparation: planning menus, hiring tractors, arranging for caravans. It also requires the selection of a dress that permits the wearer to relieve herself behind a bush while exuding all the elegance of Goya's Duchess of Alba.
Having studied for a year in Seville in 2012, Kevin, my collaborator, has long dreamed of returning to document the pilgrimage of El Rocío, which was canceled for two consecutive years during the pandemic. My connection to Spain is more recent: I moved to Mallorca last year after deciding that life is too short not to live on a Mediterranean island. Kevin and I regularly work together on travel assignments, and when he told me about El Rocío, it was an easy yes, because the best way to get to know a new country is to party with it.
Although we were documenting the 2022 pilgrimage (this year's will be held at the end of May), we were also participating in a celebration. Andalusia -- famed for flamenco dancing, cowboy culture and pilgrimages -- has a distinct and seductive identity that people in the south of Spain are rightly proud of.
The El Rocío pilgrimage is arguably the most potent visual representation of Andalusian culture, and it's this, as much as religious zeal, that propels hundreds of thousands of pilgrims toward the shrine of the Virgin in the village of El Rocío. Some travel on foot, others atop elaborately decorated caravans. Many are on horseback: stiff-backed and spiffily attired riders in wide-brimmed hats, high-waisted paseo trousers and cropped guayabera jackets.
On our first day, Kevin and I wandered through Doñana National Park, some 40 minutes south of central Seville, foraging for the pilgrims we were assured would be there. Eventually we heard the faint tinkle of cowbells, the clap of horses' hooves, creaking caravan wheels, the strains of flamenco guitar, voices singing in unison. Within minutes, the dusty road had transformed into a festival. Caravans rolled past. Pilgrims pressed bottles of Cruzcampo beer and slices of cured Ibérico ham into our hands. The singing reached a crescendo.
In Spain, Catholicism is taken seriously. But so is beer, ham and cheese -- even at 10 a.m.
Many Andalusian cities, towns and villages developed their own pilgrimages -- known as romerías, so named because pilgrims traditionally walked to Rome -- dedicated to their particular patron saints. But the four-day walk to El Rocío has achieved cult status.
According to legend, a statue of the Virgin Mary was discovered in a tree trunk many hundreds of years ago, in the marshes of the Guadalquivir River. For a couple of centuries, devotion to this shrine was confined to the surrounding towns of Almonte and Villamanrique de la Condesa. But by the 20th century, in celebration of Pentecost, hermandades (brotherhoods) of pilgrims were walking up to four days to get to the area -- from the area surrounding Seville and Huelva, and eventually beyond Andalusia, from Madrid, Barcelona and the Balearic and Canary Islands. At night, the hermandades would camp in the forest, dine together at long tables and dance flamenco around campfires until the reality of the next day's 15-mile hike couldn't be ignored.
Kevin and I share an obsession with international festivals. His impulse is to capture portraits, mine is to listen and learn. But wherever we go, Kevin and I tend to fixate on the faces.
At El Rocío, no faces were closed to outsiders. We were invited into caravans; told to sit and eat stew and sliced watermelon; dragged into flamenco dances; and instructed to take a siesta after lunch in the grass -- otherwise we'd "never survive until Sunday," one participant told us. No one we encountered was reluctant to be interviewed or photographed. Everyone seemed to accept that El Rocío is a spectacle. Our amazement and curiosity was received as a sign of respect.
We joined the caravans in the muddy waters at Quema, a ford in the Guadiamar River, a tributary of the Guadalquivir. In the town of Villamanrique de la Condesa, every restaurant and bar was spilling over with spectators. (El Rocío is televised like a sporting event throughout Spain.)
By Friday night, the first of the hermandades arrived in El Rocío, a tiny town that reminded me of Western movie sets I've seen in California and Arizona. Its character is entirely shaped by the pilgrimage; the more prominent hermandades -- like Huelva, with its 10,000 pilgrims -- own huge boardinghouses at the edge of town, with convent-like rooms and vast communal dining and dancing areas. The smaller hermandades just look for short-term rentals. Even with our beginner's Spanish, we were ushered inside a whitewashed house and given beer, chunks of manchego cheese and slices of cured ham. It struck me that most Spanish culinary staples are essentially pilgrim food: controlled decay turned into a delicacy.
In El Rocío, we found religious fervor in the streets, in the Churro shacks, in the hermandades themselves. But there was also fervor for fervor itself. I'm the Irish daughter of a Presbyterian pastor, raised on no-frills religious celebrations; tea and a scone is as decadent as Presbyterian celebrations get. In El Rocío, I found myself intoxicated by the pageantry and rituals, and by the idea that a pilgrimage can and should also be a source of revelry.
Friday night melted into Saturday morning, and Kevin and I found ourselves chatting with two young friends from Madrid -- in their 30s, like us. Young people used to want to escape from religious traditions, they told us. But El Rocío offers them an escape, they said, from the stresses of modern life.
"I love El Rocío, because it's the one time of the year that my whole family gets together -- no excuses," said Carmen Mora, 32, who works for a travel tech start-up. "It's healthy to forget about city life for a week -- my city clothes, the technology, my job, the pressure."
"It's good for the spirit to be immersed in tradition," she added.

Full text: A new documentary examines the life of an actress who personified a certain kind of hopeful feminism.
To those of us who grew up in the wake of second-wave feminism, Mary Tyler Moore is a powerfully evocative figure. For this group, watching the HBO documentary "Being Mary Tyler Moore" may prove an emotional experience, conjuring nostalgia of two distinct types: the gentle sort involved in remembering a beloved star of the past, and a more painful nostalgia provoked by recalling a time when womanhood seemed to beckon with new, liberating possibilities, and feminism seemed on a steady path forward.
In her most famous role, as Mary Richards on her self-titled 1970s television show, Ms. Moore offered a dazzling new model of female adulthood: a confident, beautiful unmarried woman over 30, who supports herself, wears fabulous clothes, finds fulfillment through work and friendship, and enjoys an active love life with no apparent anxiety about finding a husband.
As Rosie O'Donnell comments in the film, this image of a woman making her own way in life was "seared" into her brain. Katie Couric concurs, noting that Ms. Moore's example "opened my eyes to 'wow, I want to do that too."'
"Who can turn the world on with her smile?" the show's memorable theme song asked -- a question then answered with the opening montage of Marys -- laughing with friends, strolling city streets and, of course, exuberantly throwing her tam into the air. The point was clear: Mary smiled at the world and it smiled back, welcoming this character into a big life extending far beyond the domestic realm.
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show" marked a transition in television roles for women, turning the page on all the dutiful wives and mothers, marriage-minded girls and those characters perpetually struggling to transcend their narrow lives: Lucy Ricardo (yearning for show business), Jeannie on "I Dream of Jeannie" (magical, yet living in a bottle and pining for a man) and Samantha Stevens on "Bewitched" (again, magical, yet confined to a suburban colonial).
Ms. Moore's career played out a version of that transition. She entered television right out of high school, as Happy Hotpoint, a dancing, leotard-clad pixie singing the praises of Hotpoint kitchen appliances on "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" -- a literal embodiment of feminine domestic labor on the most traditional of family sitcoms.
Then, as Laura Petrie on the "The Dick Van Dyke Show" in the 1960s, Ms. Moore loosened some of the typical sitcom wife's restraints: She danced and sang; she was funny; she had opinions; and at Ms. Moore's insistence, she swapped out the usual June Cleaver-esque uniform of dresses, pearls and heels for sweaters, flats and trousers that showed off her trim figure.
But as Mary Richards, Ms. Moore became an icon. She made "a feminist statement that got into my bones," Julia Louis-Dreyfus observes in the film. The show's commitment to women was palpable, foregrounding women's friendships (Rhoda! Phyllis!), treating timely issues like contraception, pay equity and feminism, and -- according to the documentary -- employing more female writers than any sitcom had before.
The documentary frames Ms. Moore's life in the context of the women's movement, interspersing footage of feminist rallies, news stories about Roe v. Wade and clips of Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan. But while Ms. Moore's TV self seemed fully in step with feminism, her personal life was more complicated. "She didn't think feminism was so hotsy-totsy," says Ms. Moore's close friend, the actress Beverly Sanders. "She identified with it, up to a point."
Unlike the boldly single Mary Richards, Ms. Moore had been married virtually her entire adult life. She wed first at 18 and had her only child, a son named Richard; divorced; and soon thereafter married the producer Grant Tinker, who masterminded her career and with whom she founded MTM Enterprises, her wildly successful production company. Not particularly independent at that time, Ms. Moore admitted that she relied heavily upon Mr. Tinker's judgment: "I was very much a person who liked being directed and led."
Significant challenges beset her years with Mr. Tinker. She suffered a miscarriage and then, at 34, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes (whose complications plagued her for the rest of her life). She also battled alcoholism.
In 1978, her younger sister, Elizabeth, died by suicide. And most painful perhaps was her distant relationship to her son, with whom she struggled to connect. Friends note often in the film that, offscreen, Ms. Moore could seem aloof and detached, unlike her onscreen upbeat self.
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show" ended in 1976, and Ms. Moore embarked on a new, Mary Richards-style chapter in her personal life, divorcing Mr. Tinker and moving alone to New York City. Professionally, though, she left Mary Richards far behind and turned her attention to theater and film, proving especially gifted at serious drama.
In 1980, Ms. Moore won a special Tony for her portrayal of a quadriplegic hospital patient in "Whose Life Is It Anyway?" And she was nominated for an Oscar for her subtle performance in Robert Redford's directorial debut in 1980, "Ordinary People," as Beth, an emotionally closed mother grieving one son's death and coping with the attempted suicide of the other.
Ms. Moore saw Beth as "reminiscent of my own life," but could never have guessed how much like her life the film would turn out to be. Three weeks after its premiere, Ms. Moore's son, then 24, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, which was determined to be an accident.
In subsequent years, Ms. Moore strove to break through her pain and emotional walls. In her late 40s, she married Robert Levine, a physician 18 years her junior who didn't know who Ms. Moore was when they met. The marriage lasted 34 years, the rest of her life.
"She married a regular person," notes Manny Azenberg (the producer of "Whose Life Is It Anyway?"), and that regular-ness seemed exactly what Ms. Moore needed. Footage of the couple relaxing at the ranch they owned provide the most moving and genuine images of the entire documentary, showing an unplugged, makeup-free Ms. Moore running around in casual clothes, teasing her husband, tending lovingly to the horses and dogs she kept.
During that time Ms. Moore found the strength to tackle her drinking. She checked herself into the Betty Ford Center, an experience she described as "chiseling down to the real me" -- the use of "chisel" suggesting just how unyielding the surface felt to her. While in rehab, she said, she learned "it's not the end of the world if I'm not perfect. I never really confided in people, and I never shared any of the ugly sides."
The confession was telling. Had the need for perfection been suffocating Ms. Moore? While surely her own life and past created much of her personality, what role did her career play in this? What damage is done to those, especially women, we turn into idols -- even idols ironically of feminist freedoms?
In one moving clip in the documentary, Ms. Moore makes a surprise appearance on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" (Ms. Winfrey was apparently unaware she was coming). Visibly overcome with emotion, eyes brimming, slightly trembling, Ms. Winfrey rushes to embrace Moore. "You have no idea what you've meant to me!" she says.
Ms. Moore is warm and gracious. She likely had a good idea of what she meant to all the former little girls and teenagers who'd projected so much aspiration and ambition onto her, or rather onto a fictional character she played.
Being Mary Tyler Moore was never the same as being Mary Richards, but for millions of women the distinction is blurry. Maybe we need it to be. "Mary" was aspirational for many of us at a time that really mattered, at a crossroads in American women's history. Yes, she was unrealistic, idealized and still conforming to certain narrow parameters of beauty, class and race. But she was what popular culture offered us -- and that mattered, a lot.
There are no on-camera interviews with living people in "Being Mary Tyler Moore." In part, this is because most of those featured, including most of her TV castmates, have died (Ms. Moore herself died in 2017 at 80).
But even those still alive appear only as voice-overs, narrating footage from years ago. This grants the film a nostalgic preserved-in-amber effect, situating Ms. Moore's life firmly in the past. But it sets the world she represented firmly in the past too, reminding us that the historical moment when feminism's progress seemed assured has vanished. That inspires quite another type of nostalgia -- and it hurts.

Robin Guenther, 68, Architect Who Designed Green Health Care Facilities: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Supporting the use of nontoxic construction materials, she co-wrote the first guide to building green health care facilities and designed them to be less austere.
Robin Guenther, an architect and environmental health advocate who designed green, sustainable health care facilities and co-wrote the first guide to building them, died on May 6 at a hospital in Manhattan. She was 68.
The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Perry Gunther. (The couple's surnames shared a pronunciation but not a spelling.)
Ms. Guenther, a New York City-based architect who started designing health care facilities after graduating from architecture school in the late 1970s, was among a group of environmentalists and architects who in the 1990s began to campaign against the use of toxic materials in construction.
She was particularly focused on PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, one of the world's most ubiquitous plastics, used in everything from pipes to flooring to medical devices. It is manufactured from vinyl chloride, a known human carcinogen. Ms. Guenther began to look for alternatives, and to lecture and write about its dangers.
When she started her firm, Guenther 5 Architects, in 2001, she took as her mission statement the Hippocratic oath to first, do no harm, said Chris Youssef, an interior designer and sustainable design consultant who worked with Ms. Guenther on the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn in the early 2000s, which was built with a minimal amount of toxic material.
Ms. Guenther's awareness of PVC proved the first step in her understanding of the full health and environmental impacts of health care facilities. She and others began to catalog those effects, which included carbon emissions (hospitals are energy intensive); warrenlike layouts lit by artificial light that affected both health care workers and patients; and materials, including PVC, that could damage the health of the communities where they were manufactured as well as the spaces where they were deployed.
Ms. Guenther was one of many architects advocating sustainable and resilient building -- for example, using renewable energy sources and designing buildings that could survive the extreme weather of climate change. And she practiced what is now called regenerative or restorative design, creating spaces that promote health with natural light sources and access to nature, and that connect to the surrounding community and support it.
"She changed the nature of health care construction," said Bill Walsh, the founder of the Healthy Building Network, one of many environmental organizations that had Ms. Guenther as a board member and an adviser. He added that she had been a leader in designing strategies for removing vinyl from buildings. "She was not all sizzle and no steak," he said.
One of her standout works was the Center for Discovery in Harris, N.Y., a 27,000-square-foot treatment facility in Sullivan County for children and adults with severe neurological impairments that opened in 2002. The structure, airy and barnlike, is made from renewable, nontoxic materials, and heated and cooled by a geothermal system.
In 2003, Ms. Guenther, working with a team that included Gail Vittori, a sustainability expert who had been designing policy initiatives and protocols and creating standards for green building since the 1980s, and Tom Lent, then the policy director for the Healthy Building Network, created the Green Guide for Healthcare, a set of environmentally conscious, health-based building standards customized for the health care industry.
Modeled after the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED certification program for rating sustainability in buildings, the guide covered a wide range of topics, including how to avoid toxic chemicals, the importance of natural light to support circadian rhythms, and the need to provide places of respite and connections to nature.
By the second year of its release, the guide had been downloaded 11,000 times in every U.S. state and in more than 80 countries. It became the basis for LEED certification specific to the health care sector.
Still, skeptics felt that green building in the health care industry would be cost-prohibitive. So Ms. Guenther, Ms. Vittori and others conducted two studies that showed that these projects cost nearly the same as conventional ones. In 2007, Ms. Guenther and Ms. Vittori published "Sustainable Healthcare Architecture," which included case studies of more than 50 projects. In 2014, Ms. Guenther delivered a TedMed talk titled "Why hospitals are making us sick," which has been viewed tens of thousands of times.
In an email, Mr. Lent said that "Robin understood at a deep level the responsibility of the architect, engineer and interior designer (really everyone involved in bringing buildings into the world) for the health, environmental and social impact of the materials they specified and the designs they created."
He added that she had "worked tirelessly to wake up the health care industry and the design and construction firms that work with them to this responsibility."
Robin Gail Guenther was born on Oct. 2, 1954, in Detroit. Her mother, Elinor (Brown) Guenther, was a homemaker, and her father, Robert Guenther, was an executive at the Ford Motor Company. She earned undergraduate and master's degrees in architecture at the University of Michigan, and a diploma from the Architectural Association in London.
In addition to her husband, to whom she was married for 38 years, Ms. Guenther is survived by her stepdaughters, Jyllian Gunther and Nicole Palms, two granddaughters and her sisters, Lynn Monahan and Sharon Barnes.
In 2007, Guenther 5 Architects, in Lower Manhattan, where she also lived, was acquired by Perkins & Will, a global architectural firm; Ms. Guenther led its global health practice.
With Perkins & Will, she oversaw projects like the Memorial Sloan Kettering Monmouth Ambulatory Care Center (also known as MSK Monmouth) in New Jersey, a reimagining of a drab 1980s office building into an airy space with woodland views; and the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif., which opened in 2017 and won a Healthcare Design Award from the American Institute of Architects. It features an abundance of natural light, water-recovery systems for landscape irrigation, a shading system to reduce the need for air conditioning, recycled building materials and a healing garden.
In 2012, Ms. Guenther was among the magazine Fast Company's "100 Most Creative People in Business." It noted that she had developed 12 maxims for good practices in design and printed them on posters that she displayed around her work spaces.
"If you don't know what's in it, you probably don't want what's in it," one read. Another said, "Consult your nose -- if it stinks, don't use it."

The U.S. Needs Minerals for Electric Cars. Everyone Else Wants Them Too.

WASHINGTON — For decades, a group of the world’s biggest oil producers has held huge sway over the American economy and the popularity of U.S. presidents through its control of the global oil supply, with decisions by OPEC determining what U.S. consumers pay at the pump.
As the world shifts to cleaner sources of energy, control over the materials needed to power that transition is still up for grabs.
China currently dominates global processing of the critical minerals that are now in high demand to make batteries for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage. In an attempt to gain more power over that supply chain, U.S. officials have begun negotiating a series of agreements with other countries to expand America’s access to important minerals like lithium, cobalt, nickel and graphite.
But it remains unclear which of these partnerships will succeed, or if they will be able to generate anything close to the supply of minerals the United States is projected to need for a wide array of products, including electric cars and batteries for storing solar power.
Leaders of Japan, Europe and other advanced nations agree that the world’s reliance on China for more than 80% of processing of minerals leaves their nations vulnerable to political pressure from Beijing, which has a history of weaponizing supply chains in times of conflict.
On May 20, the leaders of the Group of 7 countries reaffirmed the need to manage the risks caused by vulnerable mineral supply chains and build more resilient sources. The United States and Australia announced a partnership to share information and coordinate standards and investment to create more responsible and sustainable supply chains.
“This is a huge step, from our perspective — a huge step forward in our fight against the climate crisis,” President Joe Biden said Saturday as he signed the agreement with Australia.
But figuring out how to access all of the minerals the United States will need will still be a challenge. Many mineral-rich nations have poor environmental and labor standards. And although speeches at the G-7 emphasized alliances and partnerships, rich countries are still essentially competing for scarce resources.
Japan has signed a critical minerals deal with the United States, and Europe is in the midst of negotiating one. But like the United States, those regions have substantially greater demand for critical minerals to feed their own factories than supply to spare.
Kirsten Hillman, Canada’s ambassador to the United States, said in an interview that the allied countries had an important partnership in the industry, but that they were also, to some extent, commercial competitors. “It is a partnership, but it’s a partnership with certain levels of tension,” she said.
“It’s a complicated economic geopolitical moment,” Hillman added. “And we are all committed to getting to the same place and we’re going to work together to do it, but we’re going to work together to do it in a way that’s also good for our businesses.”
“We have to create a market for the products that are produced and created in a way that is consistent with our values,” she said.
The State Department has been pushing forward with a “minerals security partnership,” with 13 governments trying to promote public and private investment in their critical mineral supply chains. And European officials have been advocating a “buyers’ club” for critical minerals with the G-7 countries, which could establish certain common labor and environmental standards for suppliers.
Indonesia, which is the world’s biggest nickel producer, has floated the idea of joining with other resource-rich countries to make an OPEC-style producers cartel, an arrangement that would try to shift the power to mineral suppliers.
Indonesia has also approached the United States in recent months seeking a deal similar to that of Japan and the European Union. Biden administration officials are weighing whether to give Indonesia some kind of preferential access, either through an independent deal or as part of a trade framework the United States is negotiating in the Indo-Pacific.
But some U.S. officials have warned that Indonesia’s lagging environmental and labor standards could allow materials into the United States that undercut the country’s nascent mines, as well as its values. Such a deal is also likely to trigger stiff opposition in Congress, where some lawmakers criticized the Biden administration’s deal with Japan.
Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, hinted at these trade-offs in a speech last month, saying that carrying out negotiations with critical mineral-producing states would be necessary, but would raise “hard questions” about labor practices in those countries and America’s broader environmental goals.
Whether America’s new agreements would take the shape of a critical minerals club, a fuller negotiation or something else was unclear, Sullivan said: “We are now in the thick of trying to figure that out.”
Cullen Hendrix, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the Biden administration’s strategy to build more secure international supply chains for minerals outside of China had so far been “a bit incoherent and not necessarily sufficient to achieve that goal.”
The demand for minerals in the United States has been spurred in large part by Biden’s climate law, which provided tax incentives for investments in the electric vehicle supply chain, particularly in the final assembly of batteries. But Hendrix said the law appeared to be having more limited success in rapidly increasing the number of domestic mines that would supply those new factories.
“The United States is not going to be able to go this alone,” he said.
Biden officials agree that obtaining a secure supply of the minerals needed to power electric vehicle batteries is one of their most pressing challenges. U.S. officials say that the global supply of lithium alone needs to increase by 42 times by 2050 to meet the rising demand for electric vehicles.
While innovations in batteries could reduce the need for certain minerals, for now, the world is facing dramatic long-term shortages by any estimate. And many officials say Europe’s reliance on Russian energy after the invasion of Ukraine has helped to illustrate the danger of foreign dependencies.
The global demand for these materials is triggering a wave of resource nationalism that could intensify. Outside of the United States, the EU, Canada and other governments have also introduced subsidy programs to better compete for new mines and battery factories.
Indonesia has progressively stepped up restrictions on exporting raw nickel ore, requiring it to first be processed in the country. Chile, a major producer of lithium, nationalized its lithium industry in a bid to better control how the resources are developed and deployed, as have Bolivia and Mexico.
And Chinese companies are still investing heavily in acquiring mines and refinery capacity globally.
For now, the Biden administration has appeared wary of cutting deals with countries with more mixed labor and environmental records. Officials are exploring changes needed to develop U.S. capacity, like faster permitting processes for mines, as well as closer partnerships with mineral-rich allies, like Canada, Australia and Chile.
On May 20, the White House said it planned to ask Congress to add Australia to a list of countries where the Pentagon can fund critical mineral projects, criteria that currently only applies to Canada.
Todd Malan, the chief external affairs officer at Talon Metals, which has proposed a nickel mine in Minnesota to supply Tesla’s North American production, said that adding a top ally like Australia, which has high standards of production regarding environment, labor rights and Indigenous participation, to that list was a “smart move.”
But Malan said that expanding the list of countries that would be eligible for benefits under the administration’s new climate law beyond countries with similar labor and environmental standards could undermine efforts to develop a stronger supply chain in the United States.
“If you start opening the door to Indonesia and the Philippines or elsewhere where you don’t have the common standards, we would view that as outside the spirit of what Congress was trying to do in incentivizing a domestic and friends supply chain for batteries,” he said.
However, some U.S. officials argue that the supply of critical minerals in wealthy countries with high labor and environmental standards will be insufficient to meet demand, and that failing to strike new agreements with resource-rich countries in Africa and Asia could leave the United States highly vulnerable.
While the Biden administration is looking to streamline the permitting process in the United States for new mines, getting approval for such projects can still take years, if not decades. Auto companies, which are major U.S. employers, have also been warning of projected shortfalls in battery materials and arguing for arrangements that would give them more flexibility and lower prices.
The G-7 nations, together with the countries with which the United States has free trade agreements, produce 30% of the world’s lithium chemicals and about 20% of its refined cobalt and nickel, but only 1% of its natural flake graphite, according to estimates by Adam Megginson, a price analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.
Jennifer Harris, a former Biden White House official who worked on critical mineral strategy, argued that the country should move more quickly to develop and permit domestic mines, but that the United States also needs a new framework for multinational negotiations that include countries that are major mineral exporters.
The government could also set up a program to stockpile minerals like lithium when prices swing low, which would give miners more assurance they will find destinations for their products, she said.
“There’s so much that needs doing that this is very much a ‘both/and’ world,” she said. “The challenge is that we need to responsibly pull up a whole lot more rocks out of the ground yesterday.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I slide into a cushy leather chair in this bustling shop next to a small flooring business. The hum of clippers echoes throughout the room.
Jay Organez swoops a crisp cape across my shoulders and grabs a pick, combing it through my hair as I describe my go-to cut: a little off the top with a shadow fade on the sides.
My eyes scan the Northern California shop -- 22 chairs in a half circle around the room, some of the individual stations with the Instagram handle of a barber painted above the mirror. A framed photo of former President Barack Obama hangs on a wall, and the TV is tuned to highlights from a recent Golden State Warriors basketball game.
But the volume is turned down low, and instead I hear snippets of conversations -- quick descriptions of desired cuts, followed by comfortable banter about politics (Donald Trump running for president -- again!) and sports (LeBron James passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the N.B.A. career scoring record) and life (a 20-something moving in with his girlfriend).
I instantly recognize the ease -- a trust built over time that sounds almost identical in the chairs here at KJ's Barber & Hair Creationz as it did a few days earlier inside polished N.B.A. locker rooms and gilded suites of five-star hotels.
Welcome to the world of influencer barbers, where a small cadre of skilled and savvy businessmen like Lionel Harris, who is known as Brownie Blendz and owns KJ's, have built trust with an exclusive and often extremely private clientele and used that access to build their own brands and land cushy endorsement deals. Mr. Harris, for example, has a recurring role on "The Shop Uninterrupted," a YouTube show that features guests at a mock barbershop talking about their personal lives as well as the world around them; Mr. James is an executive producer.
Powered by social media and word-of-mouth recommendations among V.I.P.s, the barbers have transformed what was once a stationary, monotonous job with modest pay -- a trade group estimates that barbers in the United States make $ 36,000 a year on average -- into six-figure salaries, whirlwind travel and a peek from the periphery into the world of celebrities and pro athletes.
The barbers are full-fledged influencers but also confidants to their clients -- sports stars, hip-hop legends and actors -- and although their schedules and prices have changed, they still strive to offer the same thing they got from going to the barbershop on weekends as boys: community and consistency.
Black barbershops have long provided a path to entrepreneurship and economic autonomy. They also served as centers of community engagement and congregation during the Jim Crow era, when racist laws limited the places where Black people could gather, said Quincy T. Mills, a history professor at the University of Maryland and author of "Cutting Along the Color Line: Black Barbers and Barber Shops in America."
"One could make a living, get a haircut, read the newspaper, engage in spirited conversations, play the numbers, organize a protest campaign or just take it all in," Mr. Mills said.
Over the course of a month, to see how this profession evolved with social media stardom, I tagged along with three celebrity barbers -- Mr. Harris, Marcus Harvey and Vince Garcia -- on appointments in Salt Lake City, Atlanta, San Francisco and Los Angeles, watching as they seamlessly dropped in and out of their famous clients' lives. While their clients, like those of many barbers, might want to see them weekly or twice a month, the difference is they travel to their V.I.P. customers, so they are essentially always on call.
Their own higher profiles have changed the dynamics at their original shops, and introduced a new challenge -- how to stay authentic to who they were when they started. The authenticity is part of what's appealing, said Brittany Bright, founder of the Influencer League, a group that provides marketing and management advice to people who work in the wellness and personal services industry.
"They've been able to tap into an audience that is highly engaged and interested in their professional perspective," she said. "The brand is always the foundation."
Although social media has changed the scope and location of the work for celebrity barbers, they say their drive is still grounded in a fierce desire to pave their own economic path.
It's just that now, the path isn't tethered to one spot.
Marcus Harvey, four hours off a plane from Atlanta, slung a black barber's cape over a chair facing the mirror inside the marble-tiled bathroom and meticulously situated his clippers and razors on the counter.
It was the start of N.B.A. All-Star Weekend in Salt Lake City, and Mr. Harvey was setting up a makeshift barbershop inside his suite at the Grand America Hotel.
As he fidgeted with his go-to pair of gold-colored clippers, he heard a soft knock at the door, and then Grant Hill, the Hall of Famer, bounded into the room.
"My brother, what's up?" Mr. Hill asked, greeting his longtime barber. "You ready to get this done?"
"Yup," Mr. Harvey said, guiding him toward the bathroom setup. "Let me clean you up."
A few hours earlier, Mr. Harvey, 40, had held court in the hotel's lobby, dapping up Spike Lee and recording videos he would later post for his 96,000 followers on Instagram.
One video showed an expansive view of snowcapped peaks and then cut to a close-up shot of black clippers from Bevel, a men's grooming company that has had a contract with Mr. Harvey for a decade.
"A barber doesn't just cut hair we shift thought processes," he captioned another Instagram post from All-Star Weekend. "Engineers of elegance, architects of swag, doctors of worth."
When he's on the road -- usually at least one day a week -- Mr. Harvey follows a fine-tuned routine.
He flies Delta Air Lines and picks a window seat, typically in first class. He uses FaceTime to connect with his young children, Nova and Kingsley, every night from his hotel and always packs his supplies into the same black hard-shell carry-on.
"My barbershop is in my bag," said Mr. Harvey, who grew up in Atlanta and got his first job as a teenager sweeping up hair clippings at a shop just outside the city.
He eventually started cutting hair and began to build a name for himself among local barbers. Then, in 2010, he caught a break.
A mentor whose barbershop he worked at, Ramsey Shepherd, connected him with Nasir Jones, the Grammy-winning rapper better known as Nas. It was 1:30 a.m., and Mr. Shepherd, who usually cut Nas's hair when the rapper was in Atlanta, was unavailable, so Mr. Harvey did the haircut.
"That moment really opened up a lot of doors," said Mr. Harvey, who traveled with Nas this month during a tour in Australia.
Chris Webber, the former N.B.A. All-Star, had recently moved to Atlanta to start a career as an analyst on TNT and needed a haircut. Nas, a close friend, pointed him to Mr. Harvey, who quickly won Mr. Webber over with his precise skills, endless supply of jokes and innate understanding that high-profile people want a cut far away from the spotlight.
"That was my first introduction into the world of N.B.A. athletes," Mr. Harvey recalled. "It's really been about cultivating and building on those connections."
Last year, Mr. Harvey spent several weeks in Europe with Nas during his world tour, and these days he sometimes makes house calls to the rapper in New York and Los Angeles. It's a reality beyond what he had ever imagined.
"A dream," Mr. Harvey said.
But a demanding one.
One afternoon, I met up with Mr. Harvey at his modest two-story home in Atlanta. He had just returned from New York, where he cut Nas's hair before a concert at Madison Square Garden, and was resting on a couch with his wife and daughter, who was home sick with allergies.
"While I travel a lot, I still have parenting duties," he said, cradling the 5-year-old in his arms.
When he is in town, he drops off and picks up his children from school or day care most days. He and his wife, Khrystina, like to walk laps around Piedmont Park near the city's Midtown neighborhood and go on date nights to Atlanta Hawks basketball games.
Between his celebrity clients, classes that he teaches to help other barbers build their brands, and his contracts with Bevel and a booking management company, Squire -- both of which he frequently tags on his Instagram profile -- Mr. Harvey typically brings in around $ 500,000 a year, he said. (The classes are part of his annual BarberStar Summit, where he coaches fellow barbers on, among other things, monetizing their brands online and networking to gain endorsement deals.)
"We live comfortably," Mr. Harvey said, "but it's a grind."
That afternoon, as he picked up his son, Kingsley, from day care, he rubbed his eyes -- the travel days were catching up to him. After dropping his son off at home, he turned his Volkswagen Tiguan south on Interstate 85 and drove 25 miles to Tyrone, Ga., where he wound his way along two-lane roads lined by thick forests before coming to a cast-iron gate.
He was buzzed in, and the gate slowly opened, revealing a 150-acre ranch with two man-made lakes and a mansion. Mr. Harvey pulled up to a barn on the property, which Mr. Webber owns, and began unloading his barbering tools.
The two men greeted each other with a hug, and Mr. Harvey set up a chair on the basketball court inside the barn. On the walls were posters and plaques documenting Mr. Webber's career, from his time at the University of Michigan, which he helped lead to national championship games in 1992 and 1993, to his stints with several N.B.A. teams.
The next day, Mr. Webber would be flying to New York to launch a cannabis initiative, and he needed to be cleaned up for the press event.
"A great thing about Marcus, among many things," Mr. Webber said, "is that he's always ready."
'When you look good, you feel good'
Ludacris was praising the power of a good barber. And even over Zoom, that priority was clear -- his hair meticulously braided in cornrows with a clean line up.
"When you look good, you feel good, you do good," the Grammy-winning musician, whose full name is Chris Bridges, told me, explaining that, as he sees it, Vince Garcia is among the best barbers on the planet.
"I can recognize talent," he said. "When we talk about M.V.P.s, he's one of the most valuable players in the barbering category."
Mr. Garcia, 36, who is based in Los Angeles, got his start in the early 2000s cutting hair in Toronto, where he was raised. He's Filipino Canadian but honed his skills at Black-owned Jamaican barbershops around the city.
His profile as a barber was steadily rising, and in 2008 he landed his first super-high-profile cut: Chris Bosh, a star on the Toronto Raptors. They slowly built a friendship, and before long he was Mr. Bosh's barber.
Two years later, when Mr. Bosh was traded to the Miami Heat, Mr. Garcia decided it was time for a move. But instead of Miami, he headed to Los Angeles, where he and a friend opened a shop in a popular fashion district. Soon, he had connected with some Lakers players and several musicians, including Ludacris.
"When you're in the L.A. area, there is always a celebrity clientele," Mr. Garcia said on a recent morning from his in-home barbershop, which is just north of Los Angeles and was decorated with signed jerseys from Travis Kelce, one of the top players in the N.F.L., and the N.B.A. star Devin Booker.
"There is always something happening, people are always here -- it's Hollywood, bright lights," he said.
But perhaps his biggest breaks came from Instagram.
Mr. Garcia started posting pictures of celebrity haircuts and, in 2019, signed a contract with Gillette, which requires that he post about the razor brand on social media at least a few times a month, he said. Like Mr. Harris, he also has a working agreement with "The Shop."
"The exposure from the show just elevates everything," said Mr. Garcia, who has 91,000 followers on Instagram.
Before the pandemic, Mr. Garcia was spending eight hours a day at his barbershop in the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles, then hustling off to the airport for tapings of the show or house calls for celebrities.
"As was the case for a lot of people, the pandemic slowed things down and allowed me to recalibrate," he said. He stopped working at the shop and focused on a solo career as a barber and on starting a company, By.Appt.Only., which produces specialized backpacks that barbers can use to carry their tools.
He charges $ 100 for haircuts at his house and $ 350 for house calls around Los Angeles, he said, but much of his roughly $ 250,000 income comes from endorsement deals, including a partnership with Dior.
"It's about being more than a barber," Mr. Garcia said. "Haircuts are the foundation, but for me I've always wanted to branch out."
Taking barbering to a new level
By the time I had arrived on the set of "The Shop," which was taping an episode in Salt Lake City during All-Star Weekend, Mr. Garcia and Mr. Harris were already working.
Mr. Garcia had just lined up the rapper Cordae, whose entourage was standing nearby scrolling through iPhones. In another room, Mr. Harris, who is 44 and from the Bay Area, was taking out his tools and preparing for the episode as hits from the Notorious B.I.G. played softly on speakers.
"What guys like Marcus, Vince and myself have done, in a lot of ways, is take barbering to a new level," Mr. Harris said. "But it's also about bringing up the next generation."
For Mr. Harris, who has been an influential figure in Black barber culture in the Bay Area for years, it was his primary client -- the Warriors star Draymond Green -- who helped open many doors. Mr. Green encouraged producers to put Mr. Harris on "The Shop," where he has since appeared in the background cutting the hair of celebrities who have been featured on the show, including Jimmy Kimmel and Jack Harlow.
On a recent morning, back in the Bay Area, Mr. Harris made his way through the narrow hallways of the Chase Center, the Warriors' arena in San Francisco. It was six hours before the Warriors tipped off against the New Orleans Pelicans, and Mr. Green sat in a mini-barbershop just outside the locker room.
"As a Black man, having a barber who you're close with means the world," Mr. Green said. "We talk about everything -- marriage, being fathers, just being better all-around men."
Mr. Harris, wearing a headlamp in the dimly lit room, nodded along as he used clippers to cut Mr. Green's closely cropped hair.
"One thing I think gets lost with a lot of us quote-unquote celebrity barbers is that we are first and foremost service people," he said. "Our profession is in the service industry."
And despite the opportunities that have opened up in recent years -- flying on a private jet, sitting courtside, rubbing elbows with celebrities at parties -- he still spends much of his time checking in on the seven barbershops he owns in the Bay Area and Central Valley.
KJ's, which stands for Keeping Jesus, is about an hour drive from the lavish confines of the Chase Center, in Tracy, Calif. Mr. Harris opened the shop in 2009, a year before Instagram was created.
"These are my roots," he said as he showed me around the shop one afternoon.
Mr. Harris was in a rush, but he surveyed the room, the half-circle of chairs that marked his pre-Instagram-famous professional life, the walls that now feature photos of him promoting his hair care products.
He pointed to Jay Organez's chair, and I took a seat.

Operator Of Limo Firm In Fatal Crash Is Convicted: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The operator, Nauman Hussain, could face up to 15 years in prison for the tragic crash in Schoharie, N.Y.
SCHOHARIE, N.Y. -- It was a staggering and seemingly incomprehensible tragedy: a Saturday afternoon limo ride gone terribly wrong, leaving 20 people dead, including a large group of young friends and relatives headed to a birthday party.
On Wednesday, the operator of the company that rented out that vehicle -- a 31-foot-long, five-ton 2001 Ford Excursion stretch limousine -- was found guilty on 20 counts of second-degree manslaughter in the October 2018 accident.
The operator, Nauman Hussain, could face up to 15 years in prison when he is sentenced on May 31.
The verdict, announced to an emotionally charged courtroom and after less than a day of deliberation by a jury in Schoharie County, west of Albany, caps a nearly five-year ordeal for the families of the victims, which included all 17 passengers, the driver and two pedestrians outside a cafe and store in Schoharie, N.Y.
A 2020 report by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the limousine's brake system failed on Route 30 outside Schoharie, causing the vehicle to career down a long hill to the valley below, eventually reaching more than 100 m.p.h., flying toward an intersection with another busy rural byway.
The driver, Scott Lisinicchia, managed to avoid a car but shot through the intersection, striking an S.U.V., which then struck and killed two pedestrians near the Apple Barrel Cafe, a popular local establishment. The limo then charged into a shallow ravine near the cafe, eventually coming to a stop on an embankment.
The crash was the nation's deadliest transportation accident in nearly a decade, and the investigation soon took on a curious twist when it was revealed that the owner of the limousine business -- Shahed Hussain -- was a longtime F.B.I. informant.
At the time of the accident, Mr. Hussain, then 62, who operated the Prestige Limousine and Chauffeur Service with his son out of a low-rent motel in Saratoga County, was in Pakistan dealing with health issues; he has not since returned to the United States.
But Mr. Hussain's son, Nauman, was soon arrested, with authorities noting a long history of safety violations for the vehicle involved in the accident, and the fact that Mr. Lisinicchia, the driver who died in the crash, was not licensed to operate such a massive limousine.
The Schoharie County district attorney, Susan J. Mallery, had repeatedly sought to tie Nauman Hussain, 33, to shoddy and dishonest oversight of his vehicles during the trial's six days of testimony. That argument was echoed during a lengthy, often languorous, closing statement on Tuesday by Frederick Rench, who served as a special prosecutor in the trial.
"Mr. Hussain caused the deaths of the victims," Mr. Rench said, outlining a variety of lies that the defendant had posted online about the condition of the limousine and citing Mr. Hussain's "duty" to make sure the vehicle was roadworthy. "There is no doubt as to what his duty was."
Even before the tragedy, the occupants of the ragged limousine -- including four daughters from one family -- had worried something was wrong. They sent texts -- some joking, others more serious -- saying that the vehicle's motor was deafening, and that they smelled burning brakes.
Initially, the younger Mr. Hussain had reached an agreement with prosecutors to plead guilty to charges that would have spared him prison time, with five years' probation and 1,000 hours of community service.
But that deal, decried by victims' families, was invalidated last year by State Supreme Court Justice Peter Lynch, who called it "completely disingenuous and unacceptable." Justice Lynch also oversaw the Schoharie trial.
Lee Kindlon, Mr. Hussain's lawyer, called no witnesses. In a closing statement on Tuesday, he had argued that while his client was a bad businessman who had racked up a series of vehicle violations, he was not to blame for the accident, noting that Mr. Hussain had repeatedly sought to have the brakes on the ill-fated limousine fixed.
Indeed, during testimony last week, it was revealed that Mr. Hussain was misled by a manager at a Mavis auto shop who told him that the repair work on the brakes had been done, and that another employee had placed a Department of Motor Vehicles inspection sticker on the limousine -- without doing the inspection.
"There's a large gulf between violation of some regulations and people dying," Mr. Kindlon said.
On Wednesday, Mr. Kindlon said he planned to appeal, even as the Saratoga County district attorney, Karen Heggen, indicated she may investigate the Mavis employees. Mr. Kindlon said he had briefly spoken with the elder Mr. Hussain, and said he had sobbed at the verdict.
Family members of the victims -- many of whom were in their 20s and 30s -- had filled the courtroom during the trial, weeping as the victims' names were read, and applauding as the jury departed after announcing its verdict.
Mary Ashton, whose son Michael Ukaj was killed on his 34th birthday, said she felt relieved but also wanted others involved in the accident, including the Mavis employees, held responsible.
"I'm happy for my son," she said. "He's finally gotten justice. And that is exactly what I've been fighting for four and a half years."

McConnell Ally Will Face Beshear for Kentucky Governor: [National Desk]

Full text: Daniel Cameron, the attorney general, will face Andy Beshear, a popular Democrat who is seeking re-election in a typically deep-red state.
Daniel Cameron, Kentucky's attorney general and a close ally of Senator Mitch McConnell, clinched the state's Republican nomination for governor on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press, fending off a spirited and costly challenge by Kelly Craft, a wealthy former ambassador to the United Nations.
Mr. Cameron's double-digit victory sets up what is likely to be the most closely watched and fiercely contested statewide race remaining in 2023. Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat running for re-election, is one of the most popular governors in the country, and even Republicans believe he will be difficult to beat in November.
The result on Tuesday also served as a setback for Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida as he nears an expected presidential campaign. On Monday, he had endorsed Ms. Craft, abruptly turning the race into a proxy battle between himself and former President Donald J. Trump, who backed Mr. Cameron in June 2022.
In his victory speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Cameron said, "The Trump culture of winning is alive and well in Kentucky" -- a pointed jab at Mr. DeSantis's recent remarks criticizing the Republican Party's "culture of losing."
With more than 90 percent of the vote counted, Ms. Craft, who belongs to one of the biggest Republican megadonor families in the country, trailed Mr. Cameron by roughly 30 percentage points. She was also behind a third candidate, Ryan Quarles, Kentucky's agricultural commissioner.
Republicans have long viewed Mr. Cameron as a potential political star who could join the next generation of the party's leaders. Mr. Cameron has had a trailblazing career -- he was the first Black man to be elected attorney general in Kentucky and the first Republican elected to the post in 50 years -- and his campaign is likely to draw the support of operatives and donors beyond Kentucky.
Mr. Cameron turned to the general election in his victory speech. "The new religion of the left casts doubt on the greatness of America," he said. "They embrace a picture of this country and this commonwealth that is rooted in division, that is hostile to faith and that is committed to the erosion of our education system."
And he took aim at his November opponent: "Andy Beshear is resigned to live in a commonwealth where violent crime is high and the work-force participation rate is low. He's content to preside over the abandonment of our inner cities and the desolation of our rural communities."
Part of Mr. Beshear's strength stems from Republicans' dominance of the state. The party holds supermajorities in the Legislature, making it difficult for the governor to wield much power without a veto. Yet that dynamic has allowed Mr. Beshear to avoid contentious showdowns with Republicans on hot-button issues and has let him focus on using state resources to help repair infrastructure and improve the economy.
Mr. Beshear, who coasted in his primary on Tuesday, remained mostly quiet during the Republicans' battle, running a scaled-down digital ad campaign centered on his record of expanding voting rights and presiding over economic expansion in the state.
"I'm honored to be your Democratic nominee for governor, Kentucky," Mr. Beshear wrote on Twitter on Tuesday night. "Together, we're going to continue to build on the progress of the past 3 years -- moving our commonwealth not left or right, but forward. Let's do this."
And in his victory speech, Mr. Beshear sought to project an uplifting tone, and said the Republican candidates presented a stark contrast from himself. "They're trying to pit us against each other," he said, "calling anybody who disagrees with them names, telling you it's OK to yell, even hate your fellow human being. We are so much stronger than that."
Though Mr. Cameron was elected as Kentucky's attorney general in 2019, he fully arrived on the national scene with a prime-time address during the 2020 Republican National Convention.
He immediately became a favorite of Mr. Trump, who endorsed his campaign nearly a year before the primary election. Mr. Cameron made Mr. Trump's support central to his campaign to lead Kentucky, which the former president carried by more than 25 percentage points in 2020.
Mr. Cameron's tenure as attorney general has included numerous clashes with the federal government. They include his fighting vaccine requirements for federal contractors and trying to stop the Biden administration from allowing the lapse of Title 42, the Covid-era Trump immigration policy that ended on Thursday. He has also brought lawsuits against Mr. Beshear, including seeking new limits to abortion access.
These legal tussles became a cornerstone of his stump speech.
"When Governor Beshear decided to shut down churches, I went into federal court and, after nine days, got churches reopened in Kentucky," Mr. Cameron said at a campaign stop in Shepherdsville last month, referring to early pandemic regulations.
Mr. Cameron, a former aide to Mr. McConnell, was expected to cruise to the nomination on the back of his ties to the powerful Senate minority leader and to Mr. Trump. But the race tightened after Ms. Craft, who is married to a coal billionaire, Joe Craft, began pouring millions of her own money into the race, flooding the airwaves with ads. Mr. Cameron did not have the resources to keep pace.
The bruising nature of the primary raised worries among some Kentucky Republicans about their prospects in the general election.
For nearly two months, Ms. Craft was the only major candidate with ads from her or her allies on broadcast television. Combined, she and her allies spent more than $ 7 million on advertising, compared with just $ 2.6 million by Mr. Cameron and his supporters, according to AdImpact, an ad-tracking firm.
Her campaign attacked Mr. Cameron for supporting the closure of a coal plant (the coal plant in question was in West Virginia) and rebuked him for not fighting the Justice Department's investigation into the Louisville Police Department after police officers shot and killed Breonna Taylor during a botched raid on her apartment in 2020. She also sought to paint Mr. Cameron as a "follower" of Mr. McConnell, a rare public dig at a man who has guided Kentucky politics for nearly 40 years.
Mr. Cameron received a late boost from an allied political action committee, Bluegrass Freedom Action, which received most of its funding from the Concord Fund, which is part of a network of influential conservative groups managed by the activist Leonard A. Leo. The group spent $ 2.1 million in the final six weeks of the primary, aiding Mr. Cameron and attacking Ms. Craft.
Other Elections
In Pennsylvania
A special election in a district that could have flipped the State House to the Republicans instead stayed in Democratic hands, according to The Associated Press.
Top Democrats, led by President Biden and Gov. Josh Shapiro, had urged voters to mobilize for Heather Boyd, the party's candidate in the three-person race. They had framed the election as crucial to protecting reproductive rights in Pennsylvania, saying that Republicans would seek to use their legislative majority to bypass the governor's veto power by placing an abortion ban amendment on the ballot for voters to decide.
Ms. Boyd, a former legislative aide and onetime teacher, beat Katie Ford, a Republican who was a combat medic for the U.S. Army Reserve and also has an education background.
Mr. Shapiro hailed the result in a post on Twitter. "Heather Boyd is a teacher, mom, and public servant -- now, she's Delaware County's newest state rep.," he wrote. "Together, we'll work to get things done for Pennsylvanians and protect real freedom. And to Delco: Thank you for showing up to defend our rights and the Democratic House majority."
The special election, in the 163rd Legislative District in southeast Delaware County, was prompted by the March resignation of Mike Zabel, a Democrat who was accused of harassment.
In another special State House election on Tuesday, Republicans maintained power in the 108th Legislative District in north-central Pennsylvania as Michael Stender, a Republican school board member and a firefighter, was victorious in a three-candidate race, according to The A.P.
The safe G.O.P. seat opened up this year when Lynda Schlegel Culver, the longtime incumbent, resigned after winning a vacant seat in the State Senate.
In Florida
Donna Deegan, a Democrat, won a runoff for the mayor's office in Jacksonville, Fla., beating Daniel Davis, a Republican backed by Mr. DeSantis. Mr. Davis conceded the race on Tuesday evening.
Ms. Deegan will be the first woman to lead her city as mayor. "We made history tonight," she said in her victory speech. "It is a brand-new day for Jacksonville, Florida."

Full text: Lesley Lokko, its first curator of African descent, plans an ambitious exploration of the continent's impact on the globe, while coping with visa frustrations for her team.
For most of her life, the Ghanaian Scottish architect and educator Lesley Lokko, curator of the forthcoming Venice Architecture Biennale, has moved between worlds. She grew up in both Accra, the capital, with its two seasons and hot steady climate, and cool coastal Dundee. "Scotland was shiver," she recalled. "Ghana was sweat."
Her ability to inhabit and interpret multiple worlds is a talent that Lokko, 59, the Architecture Biennale's first curator of African descent, is bringing to "The Laboratory of the Future," an ambitious exploration of Africa's impact on the globe -- and vice versa. More than half the Biennale's 89 participants are from Africa or the African diaspora -- many of them "shape-shifters," as Lokko calls them, whose work transcends traditional definitions of architecture as well as geography.
Among the Venetian Who's Who is the Pritzker Prize winner Diébédo Francis Kéré (Burkina Faso and Berlin); Sumayya Vally and Moad Musbahi (Johannesburg, London, Tripoli, New York); Cave_Bureau (Nairobi), a firm that has 3-D mapped Shimoni slave caves on the Kenyan coast; the Brooklyn-based Nigerian visual artist Olalekan Jeyifous; and the noted British Ghanaian architect David Adjaye (Accra, London and New York), a close friend and collaborator best known in the United States for the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.
"It is an opportunity to talk to the rest of the world about Africa, and also to talk to Africa from here," Lokko said in a series of email and video interviews from Venice, keeping the details under wraps until the press opening May 18. Sub-Saharan Africa is often regarded as the most rapidly urbanizing and youthful population on the planet, she points out, with most people speaking more than one language. "The ability to be several things at once -- traditional and modern, African and global, colonized and independent -- is a strong thread running through the continent and the Diaspora," she said. "We're used to having to think about resources, about switching on a light with no guarantee of electricity. We're able to grapple with change. That capacity to overcome, to negotiate, to navigate ones' surroundings is going to take center stage."
On the eve of the Biennale, Lokko was busy negotiating a small crisis of her own: Last week she criticized Italy for denying entry visas for three members of her curatorial team from Ghana, and said that one additional member was still awaiting a response.
Daniela d'Orlandi, the Italian ambassador in Ghana, said that while Italy considered "the focus on Africa of this year's edition of La Biennale in Venice very valuable," it had a responsibility to enact the European Union's visa code, which, she wrote in a statement to The New York Times, "imposes an assessment not of the purpose of the trip or the reliability of the invitees, but the possession of the requirements envisaged by each applicant."
She said she was not at liberty to reveal the details of the individual cases, but "that if these are not satisfied we are unable to issue the related visa."
A Shape Shifter Herself
Lokko has long been immersed in issues of race, space and architecture -- the subject of a pathbreaking book she wrote and edited while still a graduate student at the Bartlett School of Architecture in London, from which she earned a Ph.D. Earlier this year, King Charles III named Lokko an officer of the Order of the British Empire (O.B.E.) for services to architecture and education. In 2015, she founded an influential graduate school of architecture at the University of Johannesburg. A mere four months before the. Biennale came calling, she opened the African Futures Institute in Accra, a postgraduate "Pan-African think tank" with public programs and an international reach that seeks to fill in sorely-needed gaps in existing architectural education‌.
Those considered "minorities" in the West are actually the global majority, she observes. "When you are African, you speak to a world that has an existing view of who and what you are," she said. "You walk with this kind of label. So for me, the Biennale was an opportunity to both talk about the label, to confront it in a way, but to also show underneath how similar we are."
Although the Biennale is hardly the first major exhibition to focus on Black and diasporic practitioners, the cascading crises of climate change, rapid urbanization, migration, global health emergencies and a deep imperative to decolonize institutions and spaces -- starting with the historically Eurocentric Biennale itself -- arguably make Lokko's focus on hybrid forms of practice timely, be it planners as policy experts or artist-environmentalists.
Walter Hood, a landscape designer and artist in Oakland, Calif., will offer an installation at the Biennale entitled "Native(s)" with his design for a set of public buildings for a South Carolina Gullah Community, inspired by a locally native landscape in which the community conserves sweetgrass for basket making.
The ability to "make do" and creatively improvise with existing resources can also offer a template for a sustainable future. "She has been saying for a while that it's 'our time," Akosua Obeng Mensah, an architect practicing in Accra, said of Lokko, noting that roughly 80 percent of development in sub-Saharan Africa has yet to be built.
Anonymous International style skyscrapers still dominate many African cities. "A certain generation of architects have seen 'the other' -- Europe or America -- as the model to aspire to, and unscrambling that to interpret your own modernity is very hard," said Adjaye, who expanded his practice in Ghana and has collaborated on the African Futures Institute. "In spotting Lesley," he added, "what the Biennale is getting is a real on-the-pulse desire of the continent to reimagine itself."
Lokko's father, Dr. Ferdinand Gordon Lokko, was a Ghanaian surgeon who was sent by the government to study medicine in Scotland shortly after Ghana's independence from Britain in 1957. Like many Ghanaian men sent abroad, he returned with a white wife. (Lokko's parents divorced when she was young.) Her father's mother had no schooling. "I often think about the distance my father traveled -- not just literally but culturally and emotionally," she said.
Mixed-race children in Ghana were known as "half-castes" and Lokko recalls standing in front of the mirror wondering: "'Where is the line? Is it down the middle?" she said.
She always thought of herself as half Ghanaian, half Scottish until she arrived in England at age 17 to attend boarding school. "I was suddenly Black, and I understood very quickly that in the U.K. Black was its own identity," she said. "It seemed to subsume all the cultural nuances I grew up with."
She went to Oxford, but left to follow a boyfriend to the U.S. As a girl, she sought solace as her parents' marriage dissolved by poring over kitchen magazines; in Los Angeles, where she spent four years, a chance visit with an employer to a tabletop store led to a eureka moment in which he suggested that she pursue architecture.
Building has never been her forte -- "I can't even change a light bulb," she jokes -- and she went from being a student at Bartlett to teaching there practically overnight. By the late 1990s, however, she felt increasingly stymied that the issues she cared about were not widely shared. "I've always thought of 'race' as a powerfully creative category of exploration and expression," she said. "I was fed up trying to find a way to talk about identity, race and Africa in architecture that wasn't only about poverty and 'informality,' a word I loathe," a reference to slums.
So in a plot twist worthy of Jackie Collins, the British romance novelist whose books she devoured, Lokko stepped away from architecture for 14 years to write fiction -- after reading a Time Out guide to writing a best seller. Her novels -- 12 and counting -- blend female-centered stories of passion and romance with questions of racial and cultural identity -- "heavy messages in the froth," as one reviewer put it. The latest is "Soul Sisters," a burn-the-midnight-oil cross-cultural tale set largely in Edinburgh and Johannesburg.
She returned to teaching at the University of Johannesburg in 2014, where she noticed that there were no Black architecture students. Student protests over fees, unjust educational disparities and calls for decolonization were rocking campuses across South Africa. There was "a hunger for change," Lokko recalled, and it seemed possible to attract a new generation of builders focused on issues like spatial apartheid -- the deliberately designed racially segregated settlements forged under white South African state control.
Lokko's fleeting gig as dean of the City University of New York's Bernard and Anne Spitzer School of Architecture, from which she resigned in 2020 after less than a year, made headlines in the architecture world. "It was a bad fit on both sides," she said, in which her management style -- "not formal enough, not cautious enough, not political enough" -- didn't work, complicated by the lockdown. "The history of race, labor and gender in the United States is complex and far from resolved," she added. ("I think it's fair to say I'm quite polarizing.") She was also reeling from a personal tragedy: Months before her arrival, her 52-year-old sister died from a stroke and seven weeks later, her 50-year-old brother had a fatal heart attack. "It was the worst year of my life," she said.
New York's loss was Accra's gain: With $ 2.5 million in grants from the Ford and Mellon foundations, Lokko returned home to pursue a long-held dream to create an institute that would produce what Adjaye, a patron, calls "the whole gamut -- planners, policy thinkers, inventors of materials and systems and a body of intellectuals who really understand the built environment ‌and what this means for future possibilities of the continent‌."(The Institute has plans to establish a second location at Seme City in Benin that would allow it to straddle the region's Francophone and Anglophone cultures.)
But the Biennale remains a "very exclusive European event for western audiences," noted Livingstone Mukasa, a Ugandan architect and researcher in upstate New York and co-editor of the seven-volume "Architectural Guide: Sub-Saharan Africa." "The question is whether this seasonal curiosity is the right platform to try to make seismic shifts"
In a sense, the Biennale is the African Futures Institute writ large: the Venetian extravaganza even includes a monthlong,first-ever "Biennale College Architettura" in which career practitioners and students will work on design projects with high-profile masters.
"She is using the Biennale as a platform to extend the work she has been doing for decades," said Toni L. Griffin, a New York-based planner and urban designer whose outdoor installation will be featured in Venice. In graduate school, Griffin never had a professor of color and women were few. "Lesley is able to set the stage for others," she said, "and expose the network that for some of us has always been there."

Full text: Senior cords, which feature hand-drawn details, first appeared on campuses in Indiana. Now there are high-fashion takes.
The fashion designer Emily Adams Bode Aujla bought her first pair of senior corduroy pants from a vintage-clothing seller in 2013 when she was a senior at the New School. The pants style had by then been around for more than a century.
Senior cords seem to have first appeared at Purdue University in Indiana in the early 1900s, according to an archivist at the university, and evolved to become a sort of wearable yearbook for college and high school seniors in the state.
The students would use corduroy clothes -- typically pants and skirts in cream or yellow -- as canvases that were illustrated with favorite activities, sweethearts' initials and other personal details. The practice continued for decades before it started to die out in the 1970s.
In 2018, about two years after Ms. Bode Aujla started her ready-to-wear brand Bode, which includes pieces made with antique materials and historical techniques like quilting, she started selling custom senior cords in an attempt to revive the tradition.
"We are acting as conservationists and preservationists to ensure this story is continued to be told," Ms. Bode Aujla, 33, said.
In 2019, the singer Leon Bridges wore a Bode senior cord suit to the Grammy Awards. Its illustrations featured his first name in red letters, playing cards and the Ford logo. The next year, a shirtless Harry Styles wore a pair of senior cord pants with drawings including a butterfly and a heart in the December 2020 issue of Vogue.
Last fall, the actor Jeff Goldblum appeared on the "Today" show in a Bode senior cord suit that featured illustrations of a Pittsburgh Steelers pennant, pancakes and a "Jurassic Park" logo. Earlier this year, Indiana University bought a senior cord jacket from the brand, and Bode sent along matching pants as well.
The Bode garments can include dozens of hand-drawn details, which are typically a mix of images, letters and numbers. After the Vogue issue with Mr. Styles, Ms. Bode Aujla said, her brand got requests to make other pieces with similar illustrations. But Bode avoids replicating drawings. Each piece, Ms. Bode Aujla said, "is someone's personal cord."
On a recent afternoon at Bode's offices in Brooklyn, four illustrators wielding fabric markers sat around a table covered with jackets made of corn-colored corduroy. One of the artists was drawing a blue bird, while another refined a poodle's fluffy tufts of hair.
"People love portraits of their pets," Aayushi Khowala, Bode's director of illustration, said with a wry smile.
Ms. Khowala, 25, leads the team that produces Bode's senior cord products. Raised in Kolkata, India, she studied printmaking and textiles at Rhode Island School of Design, and started working at Bode as a design assistant in 2019, after graduating from college.
Though her job now involves less illustrating, Ms. Khowala's drawings have been featured on many senior cord pieces, including the pants Mr. Styles wore in Vogue. "I pulled an all-nighter for that," she said.
Bode's senior cords, which are made with corduroy from a mill in Britain, now include notebooks (starting at $ 73) and pillows (starting at $ 268) as well as two jacket styles (both $ 2,100), shorts ( $ 640), pants ( $ 1,498) and a coat for babies ( $ 428). Bode's illustrators also produce senior cord sofas and stool cushions in collaboration with Green River Project, a furniture and interiors company co-founded by Ms. Bode Aujla's husband.
Occasionally, Bode hosts events where customers can have the drawings on their senior cords modified for free. The tradition on campuses was often communal, with students getting together to draw on each others' cords.
Adriana Harmeyer, the archivist for university history at Purdue, said the practice of drawing on the garments took off in the 1940s. Ms. Harmeyer said the first senior cords were reportedly worn in 1904, when two Purdue seniors had some pants made with a yellow corduroy fabric at Taylor Steffen Co., a tailor near the university.
"By the time the class of 1905 was establishing their class traditions, the senior cords were a part of that," Ms. Harmeyer said.
Mary Figueroa, the curator of history at the Indiana State Museum, said the illustrations on senior cords became more elaborate as the tradition reached its peak in the 1960s. "When you get to the late '60s, you start seeing airbrushing, and people start making them really pop," she said.
At Noblesville High School in Noblesville, Ind., some students still carry on the tradition, but with garments made of white denim instead of corduroy. Marnie Cooke, a spokeswoman for Noblesville schools, whose daughter is a senior at the high school, said the cords are a celebration of friendship and a way for students to express their personalities and artistic visions.
Though most of Bode's senior cord products can take up to eight weeks to make, it takes only days to complete a piece's drawings. Determining what to draw, however, can take longer. Ordering a custom piece involves an email questionnaire that often leads to lengthy exchanges as designs are refined.
Bode, which also sells some senior cords with illustrations chosen by the brand at a slightly lower cost, is not the only American label to embrace the tradition. Ralph Lauren has featured stories on its website about the garments' history at Purdue, and has made yellow corduroy pants printed with graphics that recall the drawings on senior cords.
Ms. Khowala said that the design process for custom Bode cords can make some customers emotional. "People are like, 'Oh I cried typing this out to you,"' she said.
Ms. Bode Aujla thinks some of the beauty of the cords is tied to how the process can feel like a therapy session. "People would be like, 'I've never told this story' or 'Nobody knows this about me,"' she said.

Norway Blazes Trail to an Electric Vehicle Future: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: BAMBLE, Norway -- About 110 miles south of Oslo, along a highway lined with pine and birch trees, a shiny fueling station offers a glimpse of a future where electric vehicles rule.
Chargers far outnumber gasoline pumps at the service area operated by Circle K, a retail chain that got its start in Texas. During summer weekends, when Oslo residents flee to country cottages, the line to recharge sometimes backs up down the off-ramp.
Marit Bergsland, who works at the store, has had to learn how to help frustrated customers connect to chargers in addition to her regular duties flipping burgers and ringing up purchases of salty licorice, a popular treat.
"Sometimes we have to give them a coffee to calm down," she said.
Last year, 80 percent of new-car sales in Norway were electric, putting the country at the vanguard of the shift to battery-powered mobility. It has also turned Norway into an observatory for figuring out what the electric vehicle revolution might mean for the environment, workers and life in general. The country will end the sales of internal combustion engine cars in 2025.
Norway's experience suggests that electric vehicles bring benefits without the dire consequences predicted by some critics. There are problems, of course, including unreliable chargers and long waits during periods of high demand. Auto dealers and retailers have had to adapt. The switch has reordered the auto industry, making Tesla the best-selling brand and marginalizing established carmakers like Renault and Fiat.
But the air in Oslo, Norway's capital, is measurably cleaner. The city is also quieter as noisier gasoline and diesel vehicles are scrapped. Oslo's greenhouse gas emissions have fallen 30 percent since 2009, yet there has not been mass unemployment among gas station workers and the electrical grid has not collapsed.
Some lawmakers and corporate executives portray the fight against climate change as requiring grim sacrifice. "With E.V.s, it's not like that," said Christina Bu, secretary general of the Norwegian E.V. Association, which represents owners. "It's actually something that people embrace."
Norway began promoting electric vehicles in the 1990s to support Think, a homegrown electric vehicle start-up that Ford Motor owned for a few years. Battery-powered vehicles were exempted from value-added and import taxes and from highway tolls.
The government also subsidized the construction of fast charging stations, crucial in a country nearly as big as California with just 5.5 million people. The combination of incentives and ubiquitous charging "took away all the friction factors," said Jim Rowan, the chief executive of Volvo Cars, based in neighboring Sweden.
The policies put Norway more than a decade ahead of the United States. The Biden administration aims for 50 percent of new-vehicle sales to be electric by 2030, a milestone Norway passed in 2019.
A few feet from a six-lane highway that skirts Oslo's waterfront, metal pipes jut from the roof of a prefabricated shed. The building measures pollution from the traffic zooming by, a stone's throw from a bicycle path and a marina.
Levels of nitrogen oxides, byproducts of burning gasoline and diesel that cause smog, asthma and other ailments, have fallen sharply as electric vehicle ownership has risen. "We are on the verge of solving the NOx problem," said Tobias Wolf, Oslo's chief engineer for air quality, referring to nitrogen oxides.
But there is still a problem where the rubber meets the road. Oslo's air has unhealthy levels of microscopic particles generated partly by the abrasion of tires and asphalt. Electric vehicles, which account for about one-third of the registered vehicles in the city but a higher proportion of traffic, may even aggravate that problem.
"They're really a lot heavier than internal combustion engine cars, and that means that they are causing more abrasion," said Mr. Wolf, who, like many Oslo residents, prefers to get around by bicycle.
Another persistent problem: Apartment residents say finding a place to plug in their cars remains a challenge. In the basement of an Oslo restaurant recently, local lawmakers and residents gathered to discuss the issue.
Sirin Hellvin Stav, Oslo's vice mayor for environment and transport, said at the event that the city wants to install more public chargers but also reduce the number of cars by a third to make streets safer and free space for walking and cycling.
"The goal is to cut emissions, which is why E.V.s are so important, but also to make the city better to live in," Ms. Stav, a member of the Green Party, said in an interview later.
Electric vehicles are part of a broader plan by Oslo to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to almost zero by 2030. All city buses will be electric by the end of the year.
Oslo is also targeting construction, the source of more than a quarter of its greenhouse gas emissions. Contractors bidding on public projects have a better chance of winning if they use equipment that runs on electricity or biofuels.
At a park in a working-class Oslo neighborhood last month, an excavator scooped out earth for a decorative pond. A thick cable connected the excavator to a power source, driving its electric motor. Later, an electric dump truck hauled away the soil.
Normally, the crew would have been required to stop working when the children in a nearby kindergarten napped. But the electric equipment was quiet enough that work could continue. (Children in Norway nap outdoors, weather permitting.)
Espen Hauge, who manages city construction projects, said he was surprised at how quickly contractors substituted hard-to-find electric equipment for diesel machinery. "Some projects that we thought were impossible or very difficult to do zero emission, we still got the tender for zero emission," he said.
Ms. Stav acknowledged what she called the hypocrisy of Norway's drive to reduce greenhouse gases while producing lots of oil and gas. Fossil-fuel exports generated revenue of $ 180 billion last year. "We're exporting that pollution," Ms. Stav said, noting that her party has called for oil and gas production to be phased out by 2035.
But Norway's government has not pulled back on oil and gas production. "We have several fields in production, or under development, providing energy security to Europe," Amund Vik, state secretary in the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, said in a statement.
Elsewhere, Norway's power grid has held up fine even with more demand for electricity. It helps that the country has abundant hydropower. Even so, electric vehicles have increased the demand for electricity modestly, according to calculations by the E.V. Association, and most owners are charging cars at night, when demand is lower and power is cheaper.
Elvia, which supplies electricity to Oslo and the surrounding area, has had to install new substations and transformers in some places, said Anne Nysæther, the company's managing director. But, she added, "we haven't seen any issue of the grid collapsing."
Nor has there been a rise in unemployment among auto mechanics. Electric vehicles don't need oil changes and require less maintenance than gasoline cars, but they still break down. And there are plenty of gasoline cars that will need maintenance for years.
Sindre Dranberg, who has worked at a Volkswagen dealership in Oslo since the 1980s, underwent training to service electric-vehicle batteries. Was it difficult to make the switch? "No," he said, as he replaced defective cells in a Volkswagen e-Golf.
Electric vehicles are creating jobs in other industries. In Fredrikstad, 55 miles south of Oslo, a former steel plant has become a battery recycling center. Workers, including some who worked at the steel plant, dismantle battery packs. A machine then shreds the packs to separate plastic, aluminum and copper from a black mass that contains crucial ingredients such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and graphite.
The factory, owned by Hydrovolt, is the first of several the company plans to build in Europe and the United States. So far, there is not much to recycle, but eventually recycled batteries could greatly reduce the need for mining.
"If we can take the active material that already is within the product and create new ones, then we create a shortcut," said Peter Qvarfordt, the chief executive of Hydrovolt, a joint venture of the aluminum producer Norsk Hydro and Northvolt, a battery maker.
If anyone has to worry about their jobs, it's car dealers. The almost complete disappearance of gasoline and diesel vehicles from showrooms has reordered the industry.
The Moller Mobility Group has long been Norway's biggest auto retailer, with sales last year of $ 3.7 billion and dealerships in Sweden and the Baltic countries. Moller's Oslo outlet is filled with electric Volkswagens like the ID.4 and the ID.Buzz. There are only a few internal combustion cars.
Yet, Tesla is greatly outselling Volkswagen in Norway, grabbing 30 percent of the market compared to 19 percent for Volkswagen and its Skoda and Audi brands, according to the Road Information Council.
Sales of electric cars from Chinese companies like BYD and Xpeng are also growing. If that pattern repeats itself elsewhere in Europe and in the United States, some established carmakers might not survive.
Petter Hellman, the chief executive of Moller Mobility, predicted that traditional brands would regain ground because customers trust them and they have extensive service networks. "But clearly," he added, "Tesla has shaken the industry."
Circle K, which bought gas stations that had belonged to a Norwegian government-owned oil company, is using the country to learn how to serve electric car owners in the United States and Europe. The chain, now owned by Alimentation Couche-Tard, a company based near Montreal, has more than 9,000 stores in North America.
Guro Stordal, a Circle K executive, has the difficult task of developing charging infrastructure that works with dozens of vehicle brands, each with its own software.
Electric vehicle owners tend to spend more time at Circle K because charging takes longer than filling a gasoline tank. That's good for food sales. But gasoline remains an important source of revenue.
"We do see it as an opportunity," Hakon Stiksrud, Circle K's head of global e-mobility, said of electric vehicles. "But if we are not capable of grasping those opportunities, it quickly becomes a threat."

Full text: Revelations that migrant children have been exploited for cheap labor brought calls for action, but a partisan battle over immigration policy has complicated lawmakers' efforts.
Weeks after revelations that migrant children are being regularly exploited for cheap labor in the United States prompted bipartisan outrage and calls to action on Capitol Hill, Congress has moved no closer to addressing the issue, which has become mired in a long-running partisan war over immigration policy.
Legislation to crack down on companies' use of child labor has gone nowhere and currently has little Republican backing, while Democrats' efforts to increase funding for federal agencies to provide more support services to migrant children who cross the border by themselves face long odds in the House, where the G.O.P. has pledged to slash agency budgets.
At the time, Republican proposals to institute tougher vetting of adults in households sponsoring migrant children and expedite the removal of unaccompanied minors stand little chance of gaining ground in the Democratic-led Senate.
Instead, as Congress prepares to wade into a bitter debate over immigration policy in the coming days, Republicans and Democrats have retreated to their opposite corners, abandoning whatever initial hope there may have been for tackling the issue of child labor in a bipartisan way.
Republicans have pointed to exploitative conditions at companies employing migrant children, documented in an investigation by The New York Times, to justify a hard-line immigration package. The Times reported in February that as the number of children crossing the southern border alone has soared to record levels, many have taken on dangerous jobs that violate longstanding labor laws, including in factories, slaughterhouses and at construction sites.
The G.O.P.'s legislation, headed for a House vote this week, would restore a series of stringent policies championed under the Trump administration, including measures to hold migrant children in detention centers and expedite their deportation.
Democrats, desperate to avoid any appearance of aiding Republicans in their fight against Mr. Biden's immigration policies, have quieted their criticism of the government's handling of the situation, instead directing their anger at the companies that employ migrant children.
The result is that the political space is vanishing for any consensus in Congress on a policy solution to help protect these children from exploitation.
"I know it's complicated, but this really needs to be about protecting kids, and not about the bigger politics of the border," Janet Murguía, president of the Latino civil rights advocacy organization UnidosUS, said in an interview, accusing Republicans of "playing politics" and Democrats of being "skittish" in confronting the problem. "It's a no-brainer. It should be easy to find bipartisan support on this."
The Biden administration has taken steps to change some of its policies and practices since The Times revealed the explosion in child migrant labor. The Health and Human Services Department, which is responsible for placing unaccompanied migrant children in the care of trustworthy adults, has designated a team to support children after they leave government shelters, and is providing more children with case management and legal services. The department's inspector general is also conducting an evaluation of the vetting system used to place migrant children in homes.
The Labor Department has begun several initiatives to enhance its enforcement of child labor laws, and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas said last month that his department was adding a new mission to address crimes of exploitation, including a focus on migrant child labor victims.
Still, there is little sign of meaningful momentum to enact legislation that could stop the exploitation of child migrants as workers. In the opening throes of lawmakers' outrage, Republicans and Democrats alike spoke out angrily about the issue, taking the Biden administration to task. Leading members of both parties sent rounds of letters to Cabinet secretaries demanding to know how unaccompanied minors ended up filling dangerous jobs on grueling factory shifts. Rank-and-file lawmakers drafted bipartisan legislation to raise fines against companies violating child labor laws.
But by the time Congress held its first oversight hearings on the issue last month, the subject had been subsumed into a looming fight in the House over a border security bill, and a ramped-up Republican campaign to impeach Mr. Mayorkas over the state of the southern border.
Even in a series of hearings organized expressly to address the trend of migrant child labor, Republicans have used the topic to condemn the Biden administration's overall immigration policies.
"This is a crisis made worse by President Biden's open-border agenda," Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington Republican and the chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said last month during an oversight hearing with the inspector general of the Health and Human Services Department.
At a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, berated Mr. Mayorkas on the issue, suggesting it should cost him his job.
"You have at every stage facilitated this modern-day indentured servitude of children," Mr. Hawley yelled. "Why should you not be impeached for this?"
At the same time, Democrats have tempered their criticism of the Biden administration for the crisis, even as some of them have continued to declare the government's handling of the matter unacceptable. They have reserved their toughest words for Republicans, whose proposed policies they argue would worsen a humanitarian crisis.
"It is hard to take seriously the party that boasts of its concerns for exploited children while simultaneously stripping vital protections from unaccompanied children," Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said during the recent hearing.
He defended the administration's handling of the matter, including its vetting of sponsors.
"Despite the fact that there have been some pretty heartbreaking stories of sponsors being traffickers or using the children to work, it's my understanding that this past fiscal year over 85 percent of sponsors are close family members," Mr. Nadler said during a recent Judiciary subcommittee hearing on migrant child labor.
These relatives are often uncles or cousins who the arriving children hardly know, and some of them push the minors to work hazardous jobs, The Times found in its reporting.
In the Senate, Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said last week that he was working to bring in senior officials to testify about migrant child exploitation. Mr. Durbin was one of the first Democrats to send letters to the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, demanding to know what steps were being taken to protect children from the conditions laid out in the Times's reporting.
But some Democrats say that their party has been too timid in confronting the Biden administration on the crisis.
"What we see is Republicans not wanting to hold Republican administrations to account, and Democrats not wanting to hold Democratic administrations to account," Representative Katie Porter, a California Democrat, said in an interview.
Several Democrats have sent letters to the companies named in the Times investigation, asking them what steps they have taken to ensure they do not employ minors going forward. A group of a dozen major institutional investors, including state officials from New York, Connecticut and Maine, sent their own letters, and New Mexico's treasurer placed several of the companies on a list barring future investments. Ford said it would require staffing agencies to provide better age verification, and Ben & Jerry's, which is facing a class-action lawsuit over the presence of young workers in its supply chain, pledged to suspend dairy farms that use child labor.
Other Democrats have held their public fire, as the companies pressure lawmakers to give them more time.
In March, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus drafted letters to send to the chief executives of companies implicated in the use of child labor, in which they said each corporation "must take necessary measures to remove child labor throughout its supply chain" and requested briefings, according to a draft shared with The New York Times. The group informed the White House that the letters were coming.
But the effort stalled as companies including PepsiCo and General Motors lobbied members of the caucus to hold off, according to two people familiar with the initiative.
The letters were never sent.
At the same time, the two parties have pursued divergent legislative paths. In late March, Representatives Hillary Scholten of Michigan, a Democrat, and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, a Republican, joined forces on a bill to increase civil penalties for individual child labor law infractions almost tenfold from their current caps of about $ 15,000 per routine violation. It mirrored a measure introduced several weeks earlier by Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii.
But since then, House Democrats have rallied around a more aggressive proposal from Representative Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, that would set the maximum civil payouts even higher, and establish new criminal liabilities for companies that repeatedly flout child labor laws. Democrats in the House and the Senate have also introduced legislation to deny Agriculture Department contracts to companies that commit egregious violations of labor laws, including exploiting children, whether directly or through subcontractors. No House Republicans other than Ms. Mace have signed on to the measures.
Republicans have only just begun to propose similar legislative changes. On Wednesday, Mr. Hawley introduced a measure that would impose fines of up to $ 100 million against violators of labor laws and $ 500 million against willful violators, but only for the largest corporations -- those that do at least half a billion dollars in business annually.
Many other Republicans argue that going after companies is simply not a priority.
"I'm fine thinking about that, but at the end of the day, stop the magnet," said Representative Chip Roy of Texas, a chief architect of his party's strict border security bill, arguing that policies allowing migrant children to enter the United States were the main reason children were being put to work.
When it comes to companies exploiting children, he added, "I'm pretty sure that's already against the law."

Empire State Building Murals Resurface: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The skyscraper once held some beloved Art Deco artworks: Winold Reiss's commission for a Longchamps restaurant.
Towering remnants of tropical décor from the young Empire State Building, which were believed to have vanished decades ago, will return to public view on May 12 in a TEFAF art fair booth at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan. Bernard Goldberg Fine Arts gallery will offer these works, two oval murals of damsels engulfed in rainbows of blossoms and foliage, which the German-born artist Winold Reiss painted in 1938 for a Longchamps restaurant at the Empire State Building's base. (It's now a Starbucks.)
"Oh, my lord," the art and architectural historian C. Ford Peatross said last month when he first saw the murals, nearly eight feet tall, at the Goldberg gallery in New York. Peatross, who has been researching Reiss since the 1980s, had previously seen only photos and sketches of the Longchamps works, mostly in black and white. "It's a major find," the historian said.
Renate Reiss, the widow of Winold Reiss's son, Tjark, who organizes and preserves the family's voluminous archives, has deemed the unsigned paintings authentic, based on archival photos and sketches and decades of familiarity with the artist's work. "This is amazing," she said upon seeing them at the Goldberg gallery, adding that she had assumed "everything had been destroyed" when the Empire State space was redone by the 1960s.
One of the ovals' long-tressed damsels is encountering a rearing leopard, and the other seems unfazed by a yellow serpent. They come from a set of eight that Reiss executed for a subterranean dining area sometimes called the Salle Abstraite ("abstract room," in French). The whereabouts of the other six are unknown. Reiss gave them enigmatic titles: Temptation, Contemplation, Liberation, Anticipation, Animation, Fascination, Adoration, and Exultation. Bernard Goldberg, founder of the gallery, said he believes that his panel with a snake was originally called Temptation, and the one with a leopard was Animation. In vintage photos, only one oval (current whereabouts a mystery) bears a label: Contemplation, with a damsel perched on a leaf and gazing dreamily into space.
Reiss (pronounced VEE-nold Rice) settled in New York in 1913, at age 27, and worked at a feverish pace during his five-decade career. Renate Reiss said that she and Peatross have asked each other, "when did that man sleep?" He produced "portraits, candy boxes, lettering, interiors, illustrating, advertising, murals, furniture design" and also set up art schools, his son, Tjark, an architect, told a researcher in 1978, 25 years after Reiss's death. Among his portrait sitters were Native Americans and Harlem Renaissance leaders like Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, as well as relatives and friends as prominent as the artist Isamu Noguchi. (The family archives also include extensive documentation of the accomplishments of Winold's wife, Henriette, an artist, designer and writer; his longtime mistress, Erika Lohmann, an artist and modern dancer; his brother Hans, a sculptor; and Tjark.)
Peatross estimates that in mid-20th-century New York, more than 100,000 people daily "dined, drank, shopped, or were entertained" in spaces that Reiss had "designed or embellished." For a dozen outposts of the Longchamps restaurant chain, Reiss provided scenery that transported diners to the South Seas, 17th-century New Amsterdam and futuristic rows of gilded skyscrapers. Some furniture survives from his interiors; at TEFAF, Goldberg, whose 25-year-old gallery specializes in American art and decorative arts, will offer a pair of serrated wooden chairs (priced at $ 120,000) from Reiss's medieval-theme grille room at a Manhattan hotel. But few of Reiss's architectural elements have been preserved. His only major public art commissions still on view are mosaics with tableaus of laborers and historical figures, made in the 1930s for a rail terminal in Cincinnati.
It is unclear how the Empire State ovals (which Goldberg has priced in the low seven figures for the pair) were initially rescued from the building's Longchamps. In the 1960s, the rooms were adapted into a Mississippi riverboat themed restaurant inspired by Mark Twain's writings. (A snaking staircase that Reiss designed for the restaurant endured until a few years ago, when the space was gutted to make way for a Starbucks.)
About three decades ago, the two same Salle Abstraite murals were consigned for auction at Sotheby's in New York, without any attribution, under the generic description "Large Oval Abstract Paintings." They reappeared in 2020, labeled "Large Art Deco Manner" at the Showplace auction house in New York (the leopard piece brought $ 2,250 and the snake sold for $ 2,750).
A few months ago, Ken Sims, the Goldberg gallery's 38-year-old director, spotted the artworks for sale on 1stdibs.com, labeled "Monumental Art Deco Paintings of Stylized Women." He recognized them as Longchamps relics and asked his boss (who is 90) for confirmation: "Is this what I think?" Goldberg replied, "No question, yes." A 1stdibs dealer in Buffalo, N.Y., sold the two murals to the Goldberg gallery for a price in the mid five figures. A recent appraisal report by the art expert Betty Krulik calls them "immensely important."
In the last few years, Reiss has been the subject of retrospectives at the Hirschl & Adler gallery in New York and the New-York Historical Society (with a catalog from D Giles) as well as an essay collection, "The Multicultural Modernism of Winold Reiss." His work is scheduled to appear next year in group exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Dorsky Museum at SUNY New Paltz. Renate Reiss said that surprisingly often, "Things show up that we didn't know survived."
Goldberg said he hopes that the six missing ovals will resurface -- perhaps the TEFAF display at the Armory, through May 16, will help someone identify another unsigned panel tucked away somewhere. When the Longchamps room was dismantled, he said, "I just can't understand that everything got thrown out." How could it be, he has wondered, that as people maneuvered through the wreckage, "nobody had taste? Nobody knew what was beautiful?"

NEW YORK — Towering remnants of tropical decor from the young Empire State Building, which were believed to have vanished decades ago, will return to public view Friday in a TEFAF art fair booth at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan. Bernard Goldberg Fine Arts gallery will offer these works, two oval murals of damsels engulfed in rainbows of blossoms and foliage, which German-born artist Winold Reiss painted in 1938 for a Longchamps restaurant at the Empire State Building’s base. (It’s now a Starbucks.)
“Oh, my Lord,” art and architectural historian C. Ford Peatross said last month when he first saw the murals, nearly 8 feet tall, at the Goldberg gallery. Peatross, who has been researching Reiss since the 1980s, had previously seen only photos and sketches of the Longchamps works, mostly in black and white. “It’s a major find,” the historian said.
Renate Reiss, widow of Winold Reiss’ son, Tjark, who organizes and preserves the family’s voluminous archives, has deemed the unsigned paintings authentic, based on archival photos and sketches and decades of familiarity with the artist’s work. “This is amazing,” she said upon seeing them at the Goldberg gallery, adding that she had assumed “everything had been destroyed” when the Empire State space was redone by the 1960s.
One of the ovals’ long-tressed damsels is encountering a rearing leopard, and the other seems unfazed by a yellow serpent. They come from a set of eight that Reiss executed for a subterranean dining area sometimes called the Salle Abstraite (French for “abstract room”). The whereabouts of the other six are unknown. Reiss gave them enigmatic titles: “Temptation,” “Contemplation,” “Liberation,” “Anticipation,” “Animation,” “Fascination,” “Adoration” and “Exultation.” Bernard Goldberg, founder of the gallery, said he believes that his panel with a snake was originally called “Temptation,” and the one with a leopard was “Animation.” In vintage photos, only one oval (current whereabouts a mystery) bears a label: “Contemplation,” with a damsel perched on a leaf and gazing dreamily into space.
At 27, Reiss settled in New York in 1913 and worked at a feverish pace during his five-decade career. Renate Reiss said she and Peatross have asked each other, “When did that man sleep?” He produced “portraits, candy boxes, lettering, interiors, illustrating, advertising, murals, furniture design” and also set up art schools, his son, Tjark, an architect, told a researcher in 1978, 25 years after Reiss’ death. Among his portrait sitters were Native Americans and Harlem Renaissance leaders such as Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, as well as relatives and friends as prominent as artist Isamu Noguchi. (The family archives also include extensive documentation of the accomplishments of Reiss’ wife, Henriette, an artist, designer and writer; his longtime mistress, Erika Lohmann, an artist and modern dancer; his brother Hans, a sculptor; and Tjark.)
Peatross estimates that in mid-20th century New York, more than 100,000 people daily “dined, drank, shopped or were entertained” in spaces that Reiss had “designed or embellished.” For a dozen outposts of the Longchamps restaurant chain, Reiss provided scenery that transported diners to the South Seas, 17th century New Amsterdam and futuristic rows of gilded skyscrapers. Some furniture survives from his interiors; at TEFAF, Goldberg, whose 25-year-old gallery specializes in American art and decorative arts, will offer a pair of serrated wooden chairs (priced at $120,000) from Reiss’ medieval-theme grille room at a Manhattan hotel. But few of Reiss’ architectural elements have been preserved. His only major public art commissions still on view are mosaics with tableaus of laborers and historical figures, made in the 1930s for a rail terminal in Cincinnati.
It is unclear how the Empire State ovals (which Goldberg has priced in the low seven figures for the pair) were initially rescued from the building’s Longchamps. In the 1960s, the rooms were adapted into a Mississippi riverboat-themed restaurant inspired by Mark Twain’s writings. (A snaking staircase that Reiss designed for the restaurant endured until a few years ago, when the space was gutted to make way for the Starbucks.)
About three decades ago, the two same Salle Abstraite murals were consigned for auction at Sotheby’s in New York, without any attribution, under the generic description “Large Oval Abstract Paintings.” They reappeared in 2020, labeled “Large Art Deco Manner,” at the Showplace auction house in New York (the leopard piece brought $2,250 and the snake sold for $2,750).
A few months ago, Ken Sims, Goldberg gallery’s 38-year-old director, spotted the artworks for sale on 1stdibs.com, labeled “Monumental Art Deco Paintings of Stylized Women.” He recognized them as Longchamps relics and asked his boss (who is 90) for confirmation: “Is this what I think?” Goldberg replied: “No question, yes.” A 1stdibs dealer in Buffalo, New York, sold the two murals to the Goldberg gallery for a price in the mid-five figures. A recent appraisal report by art expert Betty Krulik calls them “immensely important.”
In the past few years, Reiss has been the subject of retrospectives at the Hirschl & Adler gallery in New York and the New-York Historical Society (with a catalog from D Giles), as well as an essay collection, “The Multicultural Modernism of Winold Reiss.” His work is scheduled to appear next year in group exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Dorsky Museum at SUNY New Paltz. Renate Reiss said that, surprisingly often, “things show up that we didn’t know survived.”
Goldberg said he hopes that the six missing ovals will resurface — perhaps the TEFAF display at the Armory, through May 16, will help someone identify another unsigned panel tucked away somewhere. When the Longchamps room was dismantled, he said, “I just can’t understand that everything got thrown out.” How could it be, he has wondered, that as people maneuvered through the wreckage, “nobody had taste? Nobody knew what was beautiful?”

Country's Youngest State Party Leader Takes Blue-Collar Blueprint to Democrats: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: North Carolina Democrats weren't sure what to expect when Anderson Clayton, 25, won their election for chair, making her the youngest state party leader in the country. At one of her first meetings with state party officials, she said, one looked at her with a worried expression and said, "I didn't know if you were going to be a crazy 25-year-old-type-person."
Her retort: "What is a crazy 25-year-old-type-person?"
Ms. Clayton didn't get into politics just to explain Gen Z to old people, she said. She is aiming to motivate younger voters, but she also campaigned with broader goals, arguing that Democrats need to invest in rural communities if they hope to erode Republicans' grip on state and local power.
She thinks a key is being candid about her party's flaws and missteps. "People with me all the time are like, 'I wish you'd stop saying we've left Democrats behind,"' she said. "I'm like: 'We have. We've left people behind."'
In North Carolina's elections last year, Democrats ceded 44 state legislative seats, uncontested, to Republicans. Many encompassed blue-collar, rural towns that had voted reliably Democratic decades ago but by then had no official footprint from the party, much less a candidate to support.
"Put a map of North Carolina on the wall, throw a dart at said map, and any given county, 50-50 shot there's actually going to be a Democratic presence on the ground," said Jonah Garson, the party's first vice chair. With the party's election losses piling up, Ms. Clayton's campaign message was a call for a new direction.
She said that many Democratic officials viewed rural voters as out of reach. When Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2016, her senior staff scoffed when Bill Clinton fretted that Democrats were losing touch with rural voters. Why view them as valuable when they had the Obama coalition? But as it turned out, only Barack Obama could summon the Obama coalition.
"The Democratic Party has become too much of a metropolitan, cosmopolitan party," said David Axelrod, a former top adviser to Mr. Obama. "There is a sense in the party that we're the party of working people, but if you don't communicate respect, and only say, 'Let me tell you what we're doing for you,' then you're not very persuasive. And there were a lot of working people who felt betrayed."
Dallas Woodhouse, a Republican political strategist and the former executive director of the state's G.O.P., said Ms. Clayton could have a marginal effect in rural areas but would struggle to sell her message to people who view the Democratic Party as toxic.
"She can't overcome the party's branding problem based on their policy preferences," Mr. Woodhouse said.
While Ms. Clayton might agree with part of that diagnosis -- "We don't have a good brand," she said -- she is eager to try to address Democrats' rural struggles.
Her campaign pitch was personal. She grew up in Roxboro surrounded by the farms, forests and rolling hills blanketing rural Person County. It was counties like Person that had raced to the right in the years prior, and whose residents, Ms. Clayton said, had been robbed of a seat at the table. Her father, she said, disavowed the Democratic Party after he lost his manufacturing job in the onset of the Great Recession.
She also wanted to woo young North Carolinians, devising a plan to engage the state's outsize Gen Z population and tapping into the hundreds of thousands of students enrolled in North Carolina's colleges.
She wants to show people that the Democratic Party cares about them, she said over coffee recently at a Capitol Hill diner, adding that there's a "separation between politics and everyday people right now, and folks are inherently disengaged with it."
That disconnect has come at a cost. In 2022, as Democrats performed better than expected in swing states nationwide, Republicans in North Carolina held an open Senate seat and retook control of their state's highest court. North Carolina Democrats hope to emulate battleground states like Michigan, where youth turnout in the midterms last year reached nearly 37 percent and the state's leadership, for now, turned blue. In North Carolina, youth turnout was 13 points lower.
Almost three months in, Ms. Clayton and her three vice chairs are seeking to resurrect a party that has had few bright spots since Mr. Obama and Senator Kay Hagan won the state in 2008.
And while the population has grown, especially in urban centers that skew left, demographic changes have not been enough to overcome gerrymandering and put Democrats back in legislative majorities or turn the state blue in presidential and Senate elections.
While acknowledging it will be an uphill climb, Ms. Clayton's party has taken a more aggressive stance. Organizing on the ground year-round, not just in the weeks before an election, is a priority, she said.
She often spends several hours a day in her father's bright-red 1997 Ford F-250, and she estimates that she has driven about 7,000 miles visiting her state's far-flung counties. (In April, Ms. Clayton also went to the White House Easter egg roll to highlight the North Carolina farmers who had supplied the eggs.)
Back in her home state in the middle of last month, she led a rally of about 150 people in the district of Tricia Cotham, a state representative and a lifelong Democrat who days earlier switched her party to Republican. Afterward, Ms. Clayton chatted with attendees as others broke into groups and went to knock on doors in Ms. Cotham's neighborhood.
Her defection gave the G.O.P. the numbers necessary to override any potential veto from Roy Cooper, North Carolina's Democratic governor. But the new party chair, who has also nudged an increase in grass-roots donations and donors, saw it as an opportunity to alchemize anger into action.
Ms. Clayton won her race in February, ousting Bobbie Richardson, the first-term incumbent and the state Democratic Party's first Black chair, in a race widely seen as an upset. Ms. Richardson, 73, had the backing of the state's Democratic establishment, including Mr. Cooper and Josh Stein, the attorney general.
Ms. Clayton, who considers herself an organizer rather than an activist, has been involved with politics since early in her time at Appalachian State University, when she ran for a seat in the student government and then became student body president. After graduating, she worked on the presidential campaigns of Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren and on the Senate campaign of Amy McGrath in Kentucky.
She then returned to Roxboro and became chair of the Person County Democratic Party. She helped flip the Roxboro City Council in 2021 and a state legislative seat in 2022 and then decided to run to lead the state party. (She also works part time as a broadband analyst for the Center on Rural Innovation.)
Zeb Smathers, the Democratic mayor of Canton, who endorsed Ms. Clayton, said he was impressed by her understanding of small-town voters. She understood, he said, that "there are a lot more Cantons than Charlottes."
She speaks bluntly with voters she knows are turned off by the Democratic brand. Though she does not blame Democrats exclusively, she did not hold back when discussing the effects of trade deals like NAFTA, signed under a Democratic president four years before she was born, that have hollowed out blue-collar towns and lurched once-reliable voters to the other side of the aisle.
"What did it do to these communities?" she said, faulting both parties. "We never invested back in them to make sure they survived."

A Rock 'n' Roll Muse Sings Her Own Song: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Decades after those wild nights at Max's Kansas City and her many rock-star romances, she is making the case for herself.
Bebe Buell was back in town.
On a recent evening, about 75 people gathered at the National Arts Club, a private club in a landmark building on East 20th Street in Manhattan, to see her read from her new memoir, "Rebel Soul: Musings, Music, & Magic," and sing some of her songs.
The neighborhood was familiar to Ms. Buell. Soon after she arrived in New York from Camp Lejeune, N.C., in 1972, she became a regular at Max's Kansas City, the famed night spot just a few blocks away. At the time she was an 18-year-old model signed to the Eileen Ford Agency who lived at the St. Mary's Residence on the Upper East Side. The place had a curfew enforced by nuns, but one night Ms. Buell slipped out and made her way to Max's, where she would end up partying with Andy Warhol, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, and David Johansen and Johnny Thunders of the New York Dolls.
She went from It Girl of Manhattan to Miss November in Playboy magazine. She had relationships with Todd Rundgren, Elvis Costello, Steven Tyler, Jimmy Page, Mick Jagger and Rod Stewart in the years when they did some of their best work, but she writes in her book that she was more than a muse and was unfairly labeled a groupie by the press.
The people who went to see her at the National Arts Club seemed to feel the same way. One of them, Dick Wingate, a former music executive, said that, back in 1980, he had tried to get his colleagues at Epic Records to release Ms. Buell's four-song EP, "Covers Girl," but ran into resistance. "I really think she was a trailblazer in many ways," Mr. Wingate said. "She just said, 'I'm going to do what I'm going to do and I don't care what people think,' and it wasn't easy at that point in time."
These days, Ms. Buell, 69, lives near Nashville with her husband, James Wallerstein (stage name: Jimmy Walls), 56, a soft-spoken guitarist and director of concierge services at a luxury residential building. The couple said they had made the long drive to Manhattan in a rented S.U.V. with their two dogs, Chicken Burger, 15, and Lola, 11, in the back seat. Late Wednesday afternoon, in the high-ceiling suite where they were staying on the seventh floor of the National Arts Club, Ms. Buell was getting ready for the party.
At 6 p.m. the early arrivals trickled into the brightly lit East Gallery on the ground floor. David Croland, a photographer and fashion illustrator, said he had met Ms. Buell in 1972, when he was hired to body-paint her for a Ziegfeld Follies-inspired benefit. "She was never a groupie," he said. "She had her own groupies. She would just appear and people would line up."
He saw someone across the room: "Danny! Danny!" It was Danny Fields, a pivotal rock music figure who had managed or worked closely with Jim Morrison, the Stooges, the Velvet Underground and the Ramones. "She was a champion of discovering and allying herself with beautiful and talented and wonderful people," Mr. Fields said of Ms. Buell. "She was smart, sexy and beautiful, with elegant taste. I never wondered why everyone was in love with her."
The guest of honor stepped into the room dressed in black: a Calvin Klein jacket, fringed opera gloves that she had made herself, and a vintage Norma Kamali skirt.
"I'm nervous," Ms. Buell said.
She planted herself at Mr. Wingate's side. Long after the fact, she still appreciated his efforts on behalf of "Covers Girl," which came out in 1981 on Rhino Records, then an independent label known for novelty releases.
"When everybody in the business was wondering if that rock-star girlfriend, that Playboy girl, can be a rock person, or whatever, Dick Wingate had vision," Ms. Buell said. "He was smart."
"Oh, Bebe," he said, "you're so sweet to say that."
"How am I going to make you proud tonight?" she said. "I've worked hard for this moment. I know that we can't do records together anymore."
"You know, you're a real inspiration to a lot of people."
"Don't make me cry before I go on," she said.
The guests took their seats as Ms. Buell climbed onto a small stage.
"I feel like I'm getting married here," she said. "I've already cried twice. So I probably look like a wreck."
Someone in the crowd said, "Noooo!"
"I've always been a 'rebel, rebel,' right?" Ms. Buell said, alluding to the David Bowie song. "My face is a mess."
She was joined onstage by a longtime friend, the publicist Liz Derringer, the ex-wife of the rock guitarist Rick Derringer. Decades ago she introduced Ms. Buell to a high school friend, Mr. Tyler, the lead singer of Aerosmith, who became the father of Ms. Buell's daughter, the actress Liv Tyler.
Ms. Derringer led Ms. Buell through some highlights of "Rebel Soul," which covers her nights with various rockers as it charts her progress toward finding her own voice. The book also goes into what Ms. Buell describes as her "many experiences with extraterrestrial entities." For the National Arts Club crowd, she mixed in claims of her U.F.O. encounters with stories about Mr. Rundgren and other exes.
"I've been painted as this wild filly that was running around with the rock stars," Ms. Buell said. "People don't realize that wasn't the reality of what was going on. I was a young girl that would talk her head off. I wanted Todd to be a boyfriend that didn't go out with other women but that was impossible in those times."
"We were so young," Ms. Derringer said, "and it was the early '70s."
"I was 18, he was 23, and we were all gorgeous," Ms. Buell said. "The hormones were raging. There was so much beauty in New York. When Johnny Thunders walked across the room when he was 19, it caused you to take a breath. The Italian stallion, just something about him. And he had on pink satin pants and my girlfriend's boots!"
"I also had a lot of platonic relationships," she continued. "Friendships with Bowie and others that were deep."
Ms. Buell read a chapter on her friendship with Prince, whom she said she had met backstage in the mid-70s when Mr. Rundgren's band Utopia was playing in Minneapolis. Prince was shy, not yet famous, and he told Ms. Buell that she would one day see his name in lights. Before they parted, according to her book, he whispered that he thought the pictures of her in Playboy were very pretty.
Ms. Buell teared up as she finished the chapter: "I still cry about him and Bowie," she said.
Mr. Wallerstein, carrying a Gibson acoustic guitar, stepped close to her, as did another guitarist, Gyasi Heus, who, with his flowing locks and red pants, looked as if he would have been at home in the Max's Kansas City of yore. They played as Ms. Buell sang songs she had written with her husband and others in Nashville -- "By a Woman," "Cross My Legs" and "Can You Forgive," among others.
Toward the end of her set, she turned to her accompanists, saying, "All right, guys, I'm doing this a cappella." After asking them not to leave the stage, she told the crowd: "I just think they should stay there, because they look so gorgeous. Gorgeous rock boys. There's nothing like gorgeous rock boys!"
The final song was "Superstar," a 1971 hit for the Carpenters about a lonesome groupie pining away for a rock star. Ms. Buell encouraged everyone to join her for the chorus:
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby, I love you, I really do.
Big applause.
Beverly Keel, a friend of Ms. Buell's who is a dean at Middle Tennessee State University, said: "To me, her whole life has been defined by her relationships with other people. She's Liv's mom, Todd Rundgren's girlfriend, Steven Tyler, mother of his child. And now she's finally being recognized for who she's been all along."
After signing copies of her book, Ms. Buell seemed ready to call it a night. "I'm done," she said. "I got a 15-year-old dog upstairs. I've got to check on Chicken Burger and I've got to change clothes."
The entertainment journalist Roger Friedman, a longtime champion of Ms. Buell, had a suggestion: "You know what you need? You need an electric violin."
"Yeah, I could get that," she said.
"You need an electric violin," he repeated. "That would be perfect."
"Well, you can't overuse those suckers," Ms. Buell said. "You only bring them in when you need to cry."

For P.S.G., More Points Than R.C. Lens Has, But Much Less Fun: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: P.S.G. will win another French title this year, and Lens won't win a thing. But it's worth asking: Who had the better season?
Brice Samba was trying, as best he could, to share the crowning glory of his career with his wife. The goalkeeper's road to stardom had been a circuitous one. By the time Samba was 24, he had played only a handful of senior games. He spent the next few years toiling in the second divisions of France and England.
Now, though, it had all paid off. In March, not long before his 29th birthday, Samba was told he had been selected for France's squad for its upcoming European Championship qualifiers. He would be sharing a changing room with Kylian Mbappé, Antoine Griezmann and the rest. He would wear the No. 1 jersey.
Naturally, it was an achievement Samba wanted to celebrate with his wife, Jessica. He called her on FaceTime to revel in the moment together, but it did not -- by his own admission -- really work. He was, as he put it in an interview with the French sports newspaper L'Équipe, too busy being "jumped on" by his delighted teammates at his club team, R.C. Lens.
Samba's long-awaited call-up has not been the only thing Lens has had to celebrate in the last few months. He was probably exaggerating when he suggested this has been the "best season the club has had in 120 years" -- an assertion that the 1998 team, which won the French title, might reject -- but not by much.
Thanks in no small part to Samba, a key element in the most miserly defense in France, Lens started the season with a nine-game unbeaten run. It did not lose its second game until the start of February. It beat Monaco in Monte Carlo, Marseille in Marseille and then swept past Paris St.-Germain on home turf.
Thierry Henry, no less, described Lens as the best team to watch in France. "It is contagious when you see a team going forward, fighting together, regardless of the starting 11," he said. As late as April, the Lens manager, Franck Haise, was being asked if his team -- constructed on a shoestring by modern standards -- had a chance of winning the title. "We can always dream," he said. "We're not going to forbid ourselves anything."
In the end, that will most likely prove a step too far. Lens is currently six points behind P.S.G. with only five games to play. The emphasis now, for Haise, is on beating second-place Marseille again on Saturday and securing a place in the Champions League for the first time in two decades.
The title, as was always probable, will be returning to Paris. When it gets there, though, it will find a club in a starkly different mood to Lens.
These are troubled times at P.S.G., though whether it is more troubled than any of the other times is not clear. Lionel Messi, the greatest player of all time, the jewel of the Qatari project to transform the club into a genuine European superpower, is currently on two weeks' unpaid suspension, having traveled without permission to Saudi Arabia for a family vacation.
("Who thought Saudi has so much green?" Messi asked his 458 million Instagram followers this week. The answer, presumably, is "anyone who has seen your contract with the Saudi Tourism Authority.")
In the circumstances, it seems reasonably unlikely that he will be signing a new contract when he returns to Paris. Few will mourn his departure: not Messi, who has always given the impression that his relationship with the club has been emotionless, transactional; not the club, which can now part with him at no financial or emotional cost; and not the P.S.G. fans, who have spent most of the last five months jeering him at every opportunity.
That will not be the summer's only departure. A clutch of P.S.G. players, carrying the can for yet another year of disappointment in the Champions League, will be shipped out to make room for new signings.
There is the lingering possibility that Neymar may be among them; it is possible that Kylian Mbappé, his relationship with the club's hierarchy once again strained, might find his feet itching once again. Christophe Galtier, the manager, will not be around to coach, whatever happens. That job will go, instead, to whoever P.S.G. can find to manage them who is not Christophe Galtier.
Winning yet another French title will make no difference to any of that. The club's fans will be pleased, of course, by the passing of another year in which none of its rivals had any cause to celebrate. But it is hard to discern any emotion approaching genuine joy. This is just how things are now.
This will, after all, be P.S.G.'s ninth French title in 11 years. It does not matter who the coach is. It scarcely matters who the players are. It makes no difference if the team is good, or bad, attractive, ugly, interesting, dull. It can win the league when it is riddled with dysfunction, falling apart behind the scenes. It can win the league when nobody is enjoying themselves. It can win the league and it changes nothing.
In time, few at P.S.G. will remember much about this season. Not the good parts, anyway. There will be some dim recollection of Messi's unauthorized trip, of the surprising amount of greenery in Saudi Arabia, of Galtier's brief, unhappy stint in charge, but little else. It will blur, quickly, into nothing but a fuzzy outline of disappointment.
Lens, by contrast, will end the season with nothing but happy memories, recollections of one of the finest campaigns in the club's long history. There will be no trophy to commemorate it, but no matter. The year that Samba was called up to the France team, that Lois Openda scored all those goals, that Haise might have won something, will be etched into legend.
It is tempting to ask, then, which of those two teams has experienced the better season? Which has enjoyed themselves more? Soccer is, after all, about emotions as much as it is about glory, and the emotions on offer in the heart of Pas-de-Calais seem substantially healthier than those playing out in Paris.
It is, though, perhaps better to ask whether all of that wealth, all of that power, has truly made P.S.G. happy, or whether -- more than a decade on from the arrival of its Qatari backers -- one of the richest clubs in the world, the pre-eminent force in French soccer, the team that employs Mbappé and Messi and Neymar, might look at little old Lens and think: That looks like fun.
A Test of What Matters
The journey, then, is complete. In the space of three short years, Leeds United has traversed the full range of soccer's theoretical spectrum: from Marcelo Bielsa at one end, with his unwavering belief in spectacle and romance and aesthetics, all the way to Sam Allardyce.
There is, presumably, a parable in here somewhere. More than one, perhaps. It might be an example of how revolutions can only triumph if their leaders remain loyal to their principles. Or it might illustrate how pragmatism and compromise have a habit of intruding on even the purest, the most innocent, among us. It might be that ideas do not always survive an encounter with reality. It might be that they are abandoned too quickly by the callow and the plain.
Either way, Leeds now stands as a curious case study. During Bielsa's tenure, it was not simply the outcome -- promotion back to the Premier League, a top half finish -- that restored pride to the team's fans, but the methods. Leeds had a style, an identity. The club, at long last, stood for something.
Allardyce, appointed this week with the desperate, urgent task of somehow staving off relegation by sheer force of reputation, represents a permanent break with that. Allardyce is not always given the credit he deserves for the farsightedness he displayed early in his career, but he would not argue with the assertion that he is an outcome-oriented manager. He wants results. He does not much care how he gets them.
Whether Leeds fans can buy into that, though, is a difficult question. They have spent the last few years, after all, cherishing the idea that the journey matters as much as the destination, internalizing the Bielsista logic that what you do is not as important as how you do it. Soccer has long believed that fans are happy if they are winning; everything else is window dressing. Leeds may provide a petri dish to find out.
Please Do Not Be So Emotional, They Scream
A torn hamstring -- Grade 2C, six weeks out -- was the least Jürgen Klopp deserved. His racing over to celebrate in the face of a slightly bemused and utterly undeserving fourth official in the aftermath of Liverpool's late winning goal against Tottenham last Sunday was, without question, an inherently ugly act. The Liverpool manager will, deservedly, be punished.
Severely, too, because he has form for this sort of thing. He has already served one touchline ban this season. He can expect his second to be substantially longer, partly for the flagrancy of his offense and partly because the incident -- broadcast live in the Premier League's flagship Sunday afternoon slot -- was sufficiently high-profile that it has become a lightning rod for the State of Our Game. The Football Association, in these circumstances, feels compelled to look and act tough.
It is not to excuse Klopp's actions, though, to suggest that -- as ever -- there is something missing from the conversation. Every so often, managers, coaches, players and fans are informed in arch, censorious tones that they must control their emotions better. They must not get too angry, or too impatient, or too passionate, or even, at times, too gleeful.
And yet at no point does anyone seem to connect that emotionality with the sustained pitch of frenzy laced into the rhetoric that surrounds soccer: the constant calls, on broadcasts and in print, for players to be dropped or sold or replaced; for managers to change their methods or lose their jobs; for fans to fear or rage or despair.
Is it any wonder that some of the participants in the game struggle to maintain their equanimity when they are endlessly informed that their jobs are on the line, that everything except eternal victory is failure, that each and every setback is evidence, deep down, of some moral shortcoming on their part?
There is a reason that exists, of course: The soccer industry thrives on controversy and debate and drama and outrage. The people passing judgment act as observers when they are, in fact, participants. Klopp deserves to be barred. He needs, obviously, to calm down. He needs to control his emotions better. He is not, though, the only one.
A Step Too Far
To return to a theme: Soccer does not, as a rule, know how to gauge relative success. Arsenal's (men's) team will, for example, spend much of the next month or so having its very character pored over and picked apart and dredged for clues as to why, exactly, it did not win the Premier League title.
The fact that this in itself represents a considerable triumph -- that Arsenal was in a position to be criticized for not winning the Premier League -- will receive considerably less attention.
With any luck, the club's women's team will avoid the same fate. On Monday night, Arsenal lost at the death in the semifinals of the Women's Champions League: a single lapse, after more than two and a half hours of soccer, from Lotte Wubben-Moy that allowed Pauline Bremer to sweep Wolfsburg to a 5-4 aggregate victory.
It would be possible, of course, to point out that the ongoing failure of the clubs of the Women's Super League to establish some sort of competitive dominion in Europe is, given their financial edge, a substantial disappointment. Or to suggest that Arsenal, with home-field advantage and an early goal, had lacked the composure to see the game out. Or to take the path of least resistance and just blame Wubben-Moy for being caught in possession.
But again: Success is relative. Arsenal made it to the last minute of extra time in the semifinals of the Champions League without its captain, Kim Little, and its three best players, Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Vivianne Miedema, all of them victims of long-term knee injuries. Getting so far, coming so close, in those circumstances, is not failure. It is quite the opposite.
Correspondence
Never let it be said that this newsletter does not confront the most pressing issues in sports: corruption, engagement, how to get your dog into soccer games. "I would suggest you approach a club and offer him as a mascot," Stephen Gessner wrote. "You might have to teach him some tricks: bark when the opposition scores, growl at the referee, jump on the opposing manager."
This is a perfectly valid suggestion for most dogs. Sadly, it does not apply to my dog, who needs to be in my presence at all times for his own peace of mind and who has a steadfast objection to learning anything. He does have a natural indisposition toward authority figures, though, so he could probably tick the "growling at the referee" box.
The good news is that Phil Aromando might have solved the problem. "I have no idea if your dog is interested in Major League Soccer," he wrote. (Not sure, I've never asked.) "But St. Louis City S.C. has just opened a pet friendly section at their stadium." Moving to St. Louis strikes me as extreme, but also somehow more realistic than teaching him to walk at heel.
I wondered, meanwhile, if we had exhausted our seam of suggestions to improve soccer, but there is still time for a couple of doses of common sense.
"Why can't incidental, or nonthreatening, handballs in the box just be punished with indirect free kicks from the spot of the infraction?" Doug Lowe asked. "It would give the team a scoring opportunity that isn't brutally punished, as it is with a penalty." Great question, Doug, because this seems perfectly logical to me.
Adam weighed in on the need to engage the next generation of fans. "As a high school math(s) teacher," he wrote, "I fully agree with the assertion of 'to hell with pleasing restless, bored teenagers.' They're entitled enough as it is." I have redacted Adam's surname for his own protection, in the very unlikely event that any of his teenage students get this far into the newsletter.
And finally, Lee Gillette is here with an eternal plea: Why don't more people talk about Belgium? "As refreshing change goes, Union St.-Gilloise almost ended its first season in the top division for 48 years with a title, and it is in the running once again," he wrote. "In Belgium's infuriating four-team title playoff, Union is surrounded by Flemish clubs. The only Walloon club to win the title in years was in 2009, and Union hasn't won a title since 1935."
He is quite right, of course: We have covered the club's rise before, but Union should nevertheless have been included last week as a potential usurper to the established order. Mind you, perhaps be grateful that it slipped my mind: Dortmund, naturally enough, blew its chance at a first title in a decade at the first available opportunity.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A St. Louis native, he devoted his entire career to the team -- first as an outfielder and third baseman and then, for 50 years, as a radio announcer.
Mike Shannon, who played in three World Series with the St. Louis Cardinals and then became a favorite of the team's fans as one of its radio broadcasters for 50 seasons, died on Saturday. He was 83.
The Cardinals announced the death but did not give a cause or say where he died. Shannon had been hospitalized in 2020 with Covid-19 and later suffered from symptoms of long Covid.
Shannon was one of the few announcers in baseball history to spend 50 years or more with one team. His longevity was among the things that endeared him to listeners, along with his exuberance and his passion for seeing the Cardinals win.
In 2003, when the Cardinal slugger Albert Pujols hit a home run after being brushed back by the Chicago Cubs' Kerry Wood, Shannon was ebullient: "Swing and hello, Fourth of July! Take a ride on that knockdown pitch, big boy! Kerry Wood knocked him down and now Albert looks at him as he goes around first. He gives him the glare, saying, 'Take a whiff of that, big boy!"'
Bob Costas, the former NBC sportscaster whose early professional work was in St. Louis, said that Shannon's roots there were a key to his success. "He was one of those guys," he said by phone, "like Herb Score in Cleveland, Joe Nuxhall in Cincinnati and Jerry Remy in Boston, where it works because he's local, he's one of our guys -- and, in his case, grew up in St Louis and was a three-sport star in high school."
Shannon was known for his signature home run call, "Get up, baby, get up!" and for odd and idiosyncratic lines: He referred to a pop-up as "a home run in a telephone booth" and to a Cardinal victory as a "monstramental win," and he once declared that a young fan who had been hit by a foul ball "will leave the stadium with a souvenir today -- not a ball but a nice-looking bruise."
Joe Buck, who, like his father, Jack, was one of Shannon's radio partners, said by phone: "His Shannonisms made for great listening, and some of it was so illogical. But you had to know he was one of the most common-sense people I've ever met. He had a keen eye for the game and would have been a great manager."
Thomas Michael Shannon was born on July 15, 1939, in St. Louis to Thomas and Elizabeth (Richason) Shannon. His father was a police officer and later became a city prosecutor.
Mike was an outstanding athlete at Christian Brothers College High School, where he was a football all-American, and in 1957 he was named the Missouri prep player of the year in both basketball and football. He attended the University of Missouri for a year as a quarterback on a football scholarship. But he was also a baseball prospect, and in 1958 he signed with the Cardinals for what he said in his autobiography was almost $ 100,000, although it was reported at the time as $ 40,000.
After four years in the minor leagues, he played sparingly with the Cardinals in 1962 and 1963, often as the late-innings defensive replacement for the great hitter Stan Musial, who was then in the final year of his Hall of Fame career.
Shannon did not follow Musial into the Hall of Fame (although he played with several future Hall of Famers, including Bob Gibson, Lou Brock, Orlando Cepeda and Steve Carlton). But he was a solid player whose two-run home run off the Yankees' Whitey Ford in Game 1 of the 1964 World Series tied the score at 4-4. The Cardinals won the game, 9-5, and went on to take the series in seven games.
In 1967, Shannon moved from right field to third base after the Cardinals acquired Roger Maris from the Yankees. The two became close friends.
St. Louis won the World Series again that year, beating the Boston Red Sox in seven games. The next year, the Detroit Tigers defeated the Cardinals, also in seven games. Shannon hit a home run in each of those series.
Shannon played until 1970, when he developed membranous nephropathy, an autoimmune disorder of the kidneys, which ended his career. He had a career batting average of .255, with 68 home runs and 367 runs batted in, and was elected to the Cardinals' Hall of Fame in 2014. Two of his teammates died recently: the shortstop Dick Groat last month and the catcher Tim McCarver, who also had a distinguished career as a broadcaster, in February.
Shannon joined the Cardinals' promotions department in 1971 and became a team announcer the next season. In addition to calling Cardinal games, he was part of NBC's backup crew for its "Game of the Week" in the 1980s. He retired after the 2021 season.
His survivors include his wife, Lori (Bergman) Shannon; his daughters, Patricia, Peg and Erin; his sons, Michael Jr., Tim and Dan; 18 grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. His first wife, Judith Ann (Bufe) Shannon, died in 2007.
The ball that Shannon slugged in Game 1 of the 1964 World Series traveled more than 450 feet and broke the "u" in the Budweiser sign in left field at Busch Stadium, causing $ 5,000 in damage. At first, he thought he would have to pay for it.
In his autobiography, "Get Up, Baby!: My Seven Decades with the St. Louis Cardinals" (2022, with Rick Hummel), he recalled: "Gussie Busch, our owner, said in that gravelly voice of his, 'That's all right, buddy. You can break the whole sign down.' And Gussie paid for it."

Bruce McCall, 87, Satirical Artist Who Conjured a 'Retrofuture,' Dies: [Biography]

Author: Grimes, William

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On New Yorker covers and elsewhere, he lampooned the rich by forecasting a plutocratic fantasyland -- or, as he put it, "looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow."
Bruce McCall, whose satirical illustrations for National Lampoon and The New Yorker conjured up a plutocratic dream world of luxury zeppelin travel, indoor golf courses and cars like the Bulgemobile Airdreme, died on Friday in the Bronx. He was 87.
His wife, Polly McCall, said his death, at Calvary Hospital, was caused by Parkinson's disease.
Borrowing from the advertising style seen in magazines like Life, Look and Collier's in the 1930s and '40s, Mr. McCall depicted a luminous fantasyland filled with airplanes, cars and luxury liners of his own creation. It was a world populated by carefree millionaires who expected caviar to be served in the stations of the fictional Fifth Avenue Subway and carwashes to spray their limousines with champagne.
"My work is so personal and so strange that I have to invent my own lexicon for it," Mr. McCall said in a TED Talk in 2008. He called it "retrofuturism," which he defined as "looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow."
To readers of The New Yorker, which ran more than 80 of his gouache-on-paper paintings as covers beginning in 1993, his visual signature and comic universe were as recognizable as those of the magazine's cartoonists Charles Addams and Roz Chast.
A wider audience knew Mr. McCall through the collections "Bruce McCall's Zany Afternoons" (1982), "The Last Dream-o-Rama: The Cars Detroit Forgot to Build, 1950-1960" (2001), and "All Meat Looks Like South America: The World of Bruce McCall" (2003).
He was "our country's greatest unacknowledged design visionary," the critic and graphic designer Michael Bierut wrote in Design Observer in 2005, "the visual poet of American gigantism."
Bruce Paul Gordon McCall was born on May 10, 1935, in Simcoe, Ontario, to Thomas Cameron and Helen Margaret (Gilbertson) McCall. His father, who was known as T.C., was a civil servant and later Chrysler's public relations manager in Canada. His mother was a homemaker.
Bruce grew up with five siblings in a home tightly circumscribed by T.C.'s paltry salary and the dour provincialism of Simcoe, in the southwest corner of the province, not far from Lake Erie. This childhood purgatory provided the material for his 1997 memoir, "Thin Ice: Coming of Age in Canada." A second memoir, "How Did I Get Here?," was published in 2020.
The family's relocation to Toronto in 1947 did little to change Mr. McCall's feelings about his native country, which he later satirized in a feature for National Lampoon, "The Shame of the North: Life in a Canadian Border Town." It showed, on a supposedly dissolute strip, derelicts swigging maple syrup and louche emporiums promising such forbidden pleasures as "live, hatless girls."
American popular culture sparked his imagination, especially the magazines and their advertising, which transmitted "messages of tomorrow in steel and chrome," he wrote in "Thin Ice."
"Soon, double-decker Boeing Stratocruisers with cocktail lounges would be flying down to Rio in 20 hours," he added. "Standard transportation for Everyman was about to be a car you could fly, a plane you could drive."
After dropping out of high school in Windsor, where the family had moved in 1953, Mr. McCall found work at a local agency that turned out advertisements for Dodge and DeSoto. "The Detroit products at the time -- those behemoths -- were so awful that I found them funny and ridiculous," he told The New Yorker in 2002. "So the roots of satire were planted very early."
He was hired in 1959 by A.V. Roe & Company in Toronto to retouch photos of pots and pans for its catalogs. A year later his fortunes improved, marginally, when the publishing company Maclean-Hunter hired him to churn out brief articles for trade magazines like Pit & Quarry. He loathed the job.
In desperation, Mr. McCall, a sports car enthusiast, collaborated with a friend to start a magazine, Canadian Driver. It lasted only one issue, but it led to a writing job at Canada Track & Traffic, where Mr. McCall soon became editor in chief.
His first crack at the American dream came in 1962, when David E. Davis, the head of the Campbell-Ewald agency in Detroit, which had Chevrolet as a major account, hired him to write ad copy for Corvettes and Corvairs. It was the springboard to a flourishing career in New York, where he initially worked on Ford advertising at J. Walter Thompson. Later, at Ogilvy & Mather, Mr. McCall was put in charge of advertising for Mercedes-Benz; for several years he ran the agency's Frankfurt office.
In 1970, Mr. McCall and his friend Brock Yates, the editor of Car and Driver, invented a series of mythical airplanes, among them the Humbley-Pudge Gallipoli Heavyish Bomber, for which they wrote pseudo-scholarly historical notes. Playboy bought the idea, assigned Mr. McCall to do the illustrations and ran the collaboration in January 1971 under the title "Major Howdy Bixby's Album of Forgotten Warbirds." It went on to win Playboy's annual humor award.
"This went to my head -- in fact rearranged its contents," Mr. McCall told Macmillan in an interview for its website in 2008. "On the basis of that one fluke success, I now felt entitled to see myself as a working professional humorist."
After returning from Germany, he headed for the offices of National Lampoon with a catalog for the mythical 1958 Bulgemobile. The magazine offered him a contract to illustrate 25 pages a year. He was soon delivering spreads on the luxury liner Tyrannic ("So safe that she carries no insurance") and blue-blood sports like tank polo and zeppelin shooting. "Popular Workbench," a series based on his large collection of 1930s popular science magazines, offered such innovations as a 4,000-horsepower diesel typewriter weighing more than three tons.
McCall wrote for "The National Lampoon Radio Hour" and put in a brief, unhappy stint as a writer for "Saturday Night Live" in the late 1970s before returning to advertising. He joined the McCaffrey‌ & McCall agency (co-founded by an unrelated McCall), which had just landed the Mercedes account. After several years as creative director for Mercedes advertising, he was named executive vice president and creative director of the agency. He left in 1993.
By then his career as a writer and illustrator had taken off. Infatuated with The New Yorker since childhood, Mr. McCall submitted a humor article for the magazine's "Shouts and Murmurs" department in 1980, the first of more than 80 to be published over the next 40 years. After Tina Brown became editor in 1992, his illustrations appeared regularly on the magazine's cover and in the back of the book.
Many of his illustrations were on view in 2021 at the New-York Historical Society in the exhibition "The Fantastic City: Bruce McCall's New York." He had long worked from his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by their daughter, Amanda McCall; two brothers, Walter and Michael; and a sister, Christine Jerome.
Mr. McCall wrote the children's book "Marveltown" (2008) and provided the illustrations for "The Steps Across the Water," a 2010 children's book by the New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik. He went on to collaborate with David Letterman in 2013 on a lavishly illustrated skewering of the American superrich, "This Land Was Made for You and Me (But Mostly Me): Billionaires in the Wild."

Full text: A memo by the union's president underscores how some of President Biden's moves to fight climate change could weaken some of his political support.
The United Auto Workers, a politically potent labor union, is planning to withhold its endorsement of President Biden in the early stages of the 2024 race, according to an internal memo from its president to members on Tuesday.
The memo, written by Shawn Fain, the Detroit-based union's president, said the leadership of the United Auto Workers had traveled to Washington last week to meet with Biden administration officials and had expressed "our concerns with the electric vehicle transition" that the president has pursued.
The memo underscores how some of Mr. Biden's boldest moves to fight climate change, which animate his liberal base, could at the same time weaken his political support among another crucial constituency. The U.A.W. has shrunk in size in recent decades, but it still counts about 400,000 active members, with a robust presence in Michigan, a critical battleground state for Democrats.
In April, the Biden administration proposed the nation's most ambitious climate regulations yet, which would ensure that two-thirds of new passenger cars are all-electric by 2032 -- up from just 5.8 percent today. The rules, if enacted, could sharply lower planet-warming pollution from vehicle tailpipes, the nation's largest source of greenhouse emissions. But they come with costs for autoworkers, because it takes fewer than half the laborers to assemble an all-electric vehicle as it does to build a gasoline-powered car.
In the memo, Mr. Fain provided "talking points" for members about why the union was not immediately lining up behind Mr. Biden, writing that if companies received federal subsidies, then workers "must be compensated with top wages and benefits."
"The EV transition is at serious risk of becoming a race to the bottom," the memo reads, referring to electric vehicles. "We want to see national leadership have our back on this before we make any commitments."
Mr. Fain won the U.A.W. presidency as an insurgent candidate this year, toppling the incumbent, Ray Curry. Mr. Fain promised a more confrontational path ahead of contract talks. In the memo, he notes that 150,000 autoworkers are fighting for a new contract with the so-called Big Three auto companies in September, writing, "We'll stand with whoever stands with our members in that fight."
Labor support is a key part of Mr. Biden's political coalition and his portrayal of himself as a fighter for the middle class.
Within hours of Mr. Biden's formal entry into the 2024 race, a number of top labor unions backed Mr. Biden, including the Amalgamated Transit Union, the Service Employees International Union and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
"Several national unions were quick to endorse," Mr. Fain wrote in his memo. "The United Auto Workers is not yet making an endorsement."
Mr. Biden's campaign trumpeted his support from other labor unions in a news release. Notably, Mr. Biden's first public appearance after announcing his re-election campaign last week was addressing a labor conference in the nation's capital.
"I've said many times: Wall Street didn't build America," he told the cheering union crowd last week. "The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class!"
The United Auto Workers, which has historically endorsed Democrats and supported Mr. Biden in 2020, makes clear in the memo that it has no intent of backing the Republican front-runner, former President Donald J. Trump. Withholding a formal endorsement for now instead appears to be a bid for leverage or concessions from the administration.
"Another Donald Trump presidency would be a disaster," reads Mr. Fain's memo, which was first reported by The Detroit News. "But our members need to see an alternative that delivers real results. We need to get our members organized behind a pro-worker, pro-climate, and pro-democracy political program that can deliver for the working class."
Mr. Biden has sought to accelerate the transition to all-electric vehicles as a centerpiece of his effort to tackle climate change. A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency found that nations would have to stop sales of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 to avert the deadliest effects of a warming planet.
To help reach that goal, Mr. Biden has pushed a fleet of policies designed to promote electric vehicles.
The Biden administration's proposed climate regulations announced in April are designed to add legal teeth to consumer incentives, compelling automakers to manufacture and sell more electric vehicles. The Environmental Protection Agency rules, however, are not yet final: They are open for public comment, and could still be weakened or otherwise changed before being completed next year.
As the Biden administration prepared to unveil the new clean car rules last month, officials planned for Michael S. Regan, the head of the E.P.A., to announce the policies in Detroit, surrounded by American-made all-electric vehicles.
But as auto executives and the United Auto Workers learned the details of the proposed regulations, some grew uneasy about publicly supporting it, according to two people familiar with their thinking. No one from the United Auto Workers attended the unveiling, according to the organization's spokesman, although representatives from Ford, General Motors and Mercedes-Benz were there.
And the setting was moved from Detroit to the E.P.A. headquarters in Washington.

Full text: These shows examine breaking news in the style industry, the place of clothing in pop culture, and the forces that shape what we wear.
Fashion, being a visual medium with a relatively niche audience, may not appear to be the most conducive subject matter for a podcast. But in a peak podcast era, where there seems to be a show for everything, style has no shortage of audio content.
These six shows approach style from a variety of perspectives, exploring breaking news from the fashion industry, the place of clothing in pop culture, and the historical and societal forces that shape what we wear.
'Every Outfit'
"Every Outfit" started life as a sharp-tongued Instagram account deconstructing the notoriously fabulous fashion worn by the core cast members of "Sex and the City," both on and offscreen. Having amassed a dedicated following, Chelsea Fairless and Lauren Garroni created this spinoff podcast in 2021, where they apply their brand of snarky-yet-loving fashion policing to a much broader range of topics, analyzing pop culture news and trends through the lens of what was worn. Fairless, a social media consultant and designer, and Garroni, a writer and director, share a dryly witty repartee. On recent episodes they have tackled the aesthetics of the teen survival drama "Yellowjackets," Gwyneth Paltrow's much-discussed ski trial style, and the "ludicrously capacious" Burberry bag that gained infamy in the Season 4 premiere of "Succession."
Starter episode: "On Gwyneth's Trial, Capacious Bags, Lana Del Rey"
'Dressed: The History of Fashion'
Historians have long studied clothing to understand the economics, values and belief systems of cultures, and this richly researched podcast takes the same approach. Hosted by two fashion historians, Cassidy Zachary and April Calahan, each episode of "Dressed" delves into an aspect of style through the ages, with subjects that include the history of Black dandyism, the connection of fashion and politics during the French Revolution, and the story of the pioneering designer Elizabeth Hawes, who was ahead of her time decrying the industry's mistreatment of women. With a back catalog of more than 300 episodes, this series is a treasure trove.
Starter episode: "A Dressed Guide to Dressed, Part 1"
'Articles of Interest'
"99% Invisible," the long-running radio show-turned-podcast, considers the hidden or unappreciated role of design in our everyday lives, often focusing on architecture and physical structures. "Articles of Interest," hosted by Avery Trufelman, started out as a clothing-focused mini-series within "99% Invisible" but spun off into an independent series about how clothing design both mirrors and shapes society. Now in its fourth season, the show has examined gender constructs within clothing, the surprisingly complex history of Hawaiian shirts, and Cher Horowitz's iconic closet in "Clueless" (more specifically, the question of why it doesn't exist in the real world yet). Last year, the show debuted its first mini-series, "American Ivy," on the perennial popularity of the preppy look. Preppy style, which evolved from Ivy League style, favors neat and understated staples -- Oxford shirts, chinos, blazers -- and has become so ubiquitous that it's now, to quote Trufelman, "not the clothing of a subculture ... but the clothing of the dominant culture." That provides plenty of fodder for the insightful seven-part deep dive that follows.
Starter episode: "Pockets"
'Pop Fashion'
Begun in 2014, this weekly fashion podcast offers a rare blend of down-to-earth comedy and sartorial commentary. With a stated aim of appealing to industry insiders and outsiders alike, Lisa Rowan. a finance writer, and Kaarin Vembar, a fashion journalist, talk fashion news, breaking down what's happening with retailers, designers and celebrity labels, as well as on the runway and the red carpet. As hosts, Rowan and Vembar are well-informed, but never in a way that feels alienating to novices. And the range of subjects makes for enjoyably unpredictable listening: In a given episode, you might hear about Estée Lauder buying Tom Ford, how the pandemic affected retail worker pay, or the extraordinary story of the biggest diamond heist in world history.
Starter episode: "Fashion Inferno"
'The Debrief'
The Business of Fashion, which started life as a Typepad blog in 2007, has grown into a resource for news and analysis within the fashion industry. Its accompanying podcast has found similar success, with Imran Amed, its chief executive and founder, delivering coverage geared toward fashion creatives and executives. But it's not the most accessible entry point for non-insiders, which is where "The Debrief" comes in. Hosted by Lauren Sherman, the former chief correspondent for The Business of Fashion, this shorter-lived weekly show offered deep dives into more mainstream fashion subjects, like the much-exaggerated downfall of skinny jeans, the rise of direct-to-consumer clothing, and how Gen Z is reshaping the industry as both consumers and employees. "The Debrief" wrapped up its run in January when Sherman departed BoF, but the back catalog is well worth the delve for anyone seeking a better understanding of modern fashion.
Starter episode: "The Decline of the Skinny Jean"
'Who What Wear With Hillary Kerr'
"Who What Wear" was one of the first digital-only fashion brands, founded in 2006 by the former Elle magazine editors Hillary Kerr and Katherine Power, and in the years since the duo have launched clothing lines, a media company and written books on style. In May 2021 came the brand's first podcast, offering trend analysis, runway coverage and interviews with designers, stylists and celebrities. Kerr, who also leads "Second Life," a podcast about career pivots, is a warm and affable host whose interviews go deeper than many others in the genre. The show is also an especially smart resource for anyone curious about Hollywood costuming; interviewees have included designers from "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever," "Daisy Jones & the Six" and the original "Gossip Girl."
Starter episode: "WWW 100: Your Definitive (and Exhaustive) Guide to Spring Shopping"

Homeless in the City Where He Was Once Mayor

BEND, Ore. — Craig Coyner, a man from one of the most prominent families in Bend, Oregon, rose through an acclaimed career — as a prosecutor, a defense lawyer and then a mayor who helped turn the town into one of the nation’s fastest-growing cities.
But by age 75, Coyner was occupying a bed at the shelter on Second Street, his house lost to foreclosure, his toes gnarled by frostbite, his belongings limited to a tub of tattered clothing and books.
Coyner had been pulled through a vortex of the same crises that were churning through many boom towns across the West: untreated mental illness, widespread addiction, soaring housing costs and a waning sense of community. After a life spent as a pillar of Bend’s civic life, Coyner had somehow reached a point of nearly total destitution, surrounded by the prosperity he had helped create.
Once a tiny timber town, Bend had undergone a striking transformation in recent decades as moneyed newcomers discovered a getaway that managed to be both trendy and a throwback to what everyone imagines small-town America can be.
But as housing costs strained the budgets of Bend’s nurses, teachers and police officers, homelessness soared in the city of 100,000 people, much as it had in far larger West Coast cities. The shelter where Coyner had finally found refuge had been over capacity for months.
Coyner had been born into a family committed to civic duty.
In the early 1900s, his great-grandfather was mayor of Bend, then a newly incorporated outpost in central Oregon where timber prospectors were scooping up forestlands. Before long, a community once known as a place to ford the river was a key stop on a growing railroad network. Some of the largest pine mills in the world processed logs so massive that some first needed to be split by dynamite.
By the mid-1970s, after getting drafted for a stint in the Marines, marrying his girlfriend from college and getting a law degree in Portland, Coyner returned to Bend, following his father into a career as a lawyer and settling into a compact one-story home, purchased for $25,500 in the northeast corner of town.
The couple had two daughters but split up a few years later.
In 1981, Coyner joined the City Council. He married Patty Davis, who worked selling radio advertising around Bend, and as his former wife also remarried, he stopped connecting with his daughters.
In 1984, his fellow council members elected him as mayor.
It was a time of tumult for the city. The global recession had gutted the timber industry. Locals feared the community was on the path to becoming a ghost town.
Homeless people congregated along the railroad tracks that had helped establish Bend as a timber capital. Coyner worked to raise funds for them, at times going out to the railroad tracks himself to distribute donated clothes and 19-cent cheeseburgers. His connections helped people find cheap places to live at a time when rooms could be rented for as little as $75 a month.
Coyner saw it as a time to transition Bend’s economy to something that would harness the surrounding natural beauty in new ways, welcoming visitors who sought to ski, hike, camp and bike. He and fellow council members began drawing up plans to expand the sewer system and improve road capacity.
The timber mills were shutting down, but the old mill district began evolving into what today is a ritzy shopping district with an REI, a spa and a designer jewelry store.
Some people were wary of such swift change, and in 1992, Coyner was ousted from the City Council by rivals seeking to rein in growth. It did not work: Over the subsequent decade, the county’s population grew faster than anywhere else in the state.
Coyner returned to his work as a defense lawyer, and he regularly reminded younger peers about the importance of continuing to fight for those who were less fortunate.
Coyner had long been a personable, intelligent lawyer who got along with judges and clients, said Tom Crabtree, who was the head of the public defender’s office at the time. But in later years, Crabtree said he watched as Coyner’s amiable nature started to grow caustic.
When a judge removed him from a case one day, Coyner’s startling outburst in the courtroom led Crabtree to decide it was time to terminate Coyner, who responded, he said, with a death threat.
The underlying problem was an emerging bipolar disorder, Coyner said, compounded because he had turned to drinking as a way to cope.
On the day after Thanksgiving in 2003, a few years after losing his job, Coyner was arrested, accused of damaging a woman’s car and resisting a police officer. The state bar suspended his license in response to complaints that he was neglecting duties to his clients.
Then, in 2008, came the worst blow of all: His wife, Patty, died after an illness.
Coyner had already pushed others out of his life — not only his daughters but also his sister, who had started to distance herself when late-night drunken phone calls had turned abusive.
Police encounters twice led him to being briefly placed in psychiatric care, and he struggled to get his life back on track. But he managed to find a connection with a new friend, Cheraphina Edwards. She moved in with him to serve as a caregiver.
Even then, Coyner was regularly welcoming people who had lost their housing to stay at his small house or out in the yard. But without a job, he was falling behind on his mortgage, and the bank began foreclosure proceedings in 2012.
Coyner had worked in prior years to help others facing foreclosure, and he resisted his own fate vehemently. Still, by 2017, the police were closing in on plans to evict him.
When deputies eventually removed Coyner from the house, he and Edwards found few living options in a changed city. Rents had jumped 40% in five years. Many people who had lived in town their whole lives could no longer afford to live there.
Coyner and Edwards crashed for a bit on a friend’s couch. They spent other times sleeping in a truck, parked in the woods next to a golf course. Eventually, they heard about an abandoned cabin in the nearby community of La Pine, driving out to find that it looked more like a shed and would require them to bathe from water heated on a wood stove.
Things were not going that well between Coyner and Edwards, and in spring 2022, he moved out of the cabin and was once again on his own.
By then, the coronavirus pandemic had heightened awareness of the attractive, small-town life that Bend offered, and remote workers with lucrative salaries were scooping up homes. The median home price jumped to nearly $800,000, with houses often snapped up by all-cash buyers.
Coyner found himself camping sometimes in a tent along the Parkway, the road he had helped get built to prepare Bend for the growth city leaders had anticipated. Other times, he set up on the property of a group that served homeless veterans — an organization where he was once a board member. Sometimes he would venture near Coyner Trail, a walking path through town named for his family because of all they had done for the city.
Last fall, as overnight temperatures were dipping below 20 degrees, Frankie Smalley, a homeless friend, walked through town to track down Coyner. Then he came upon a yellow tent near the Walmart. “Hey, Craig, you in there?” he called out.
He heard a voice inside and pulled back the tent flap. Inside, Coyner’s shoes were soaking wet, his feet so frostbitten he was hobbling with pain when he tried to stand up. When he refused to go to a shelter, Smalley contacted Edwards, and she called the police for help.
He wound up at the hospital, where he was treated for frostbite, but he was soon discharged to the city’s new low-barrier shelter.
The frostbite had damaged Coyner’s toes so badly that he had to go back to the hospital at the end of January for an amputation. There were complications. After the surgery, he had a stroke that left him unable to speak.
Days later, on Feb. 14, Coyner died.

He heard a voice inside and pulled back the tent flap. Inside, Coyner’s shoes were soaking wet, his feet so frostbitten he was hobbling with pain when he tried to stand up. When he refused to go to a shelter, Smalley contacted Edwards, and she called the police for help.
He wound up at the hospital, where he was treated for frostbite, but he was soon discharged to the city’s new low-barrier shelter.
The frostbite had damaged Coyner’s toes so badly that he had to go back to the hospital at the end of January for an amputation. There were complications. After the surgery, he had a stroke that left him unable to speak.
Days later, on Feb. 14, Coyner died.

Full text: The president, who is expected to formally announce his re-election campaign this week, has won the full support of his party despite questions about his age and middling approval ratings.
As President Biden nears the formal announcement of his 2024 re-election bid, one of the most important developments of the campaign is something that hasn't happened at all: No serious primary challenger ever emerged.
Mr. Biden has all but cleared the field despite concerns about his age -- at 80, he is already the oldest American president in history -- and the persistent misgivings about the president held by a large number of the party's voters. Democrats yearn for a fresh face in 2024, according to repeated polls, they just don't know who that would be.
After Democrats won more races than expected in the 2022 midterm elections, any energy to challenge Mr. Biden quickly dissipated. The left has stayed in line even as Mr. Biden has lately made more explicit appeals toward the center. And would-be rivals have stayed on the sidelines.
The early entry of Donald J. Trump into the race immediately clarified that the stakes in 2024 would be just as high for Democrats as they were in 2020. The former president has proved to be the greatest unifying force in Democratic politics in the last decade, and the same factors that caused the party to rally behind Mr. Biden then are still present today. Add to that the advantages of holding the White House and any challenge seemed more destined to bruise Mr. Biden than to best him.
Plans are now in place for Mr. Biden to formally begin a 2024 campaign as early as Tuesday with a low-key video timed with the anniversary of his campaign kickoff four years ago. It is a rollout that many Democrats are greeting more with a sense of stoicism than enthusiasm.
"We need stability," said Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York, a progressive who won his seat in 2020 by ousting an older, more moderate incumbent in a primary. "Biden provides that."
Skating to a second nomination was not always guaranteed. Mr. Biden, as the incumbent president, was obviously the prohibitive favorite. But people close to the White House have been surprised at the speed with which the full spectrum of the party has gone from hand-wringing about Mr. Biden to almost unanimous acclamation, at least in public.
Maria Cardona, a Democratic National Committee member and party strategist, has been confounded by the doubts around Mr. Biden as the Democrats' best bet, especially against a 76-year-old Mr. Trump, who remains the Republican front-runner.
"Regardless of the reservations, regardless of the worry that he is getting up there in age -- and he is, and that is going to be a question that he and the campaign are going to have to contend with -- when his counterpart is almost as old as he is but is so opposite of what this country deserves, then it's a no-brainer," she said.
For now, the only announced challengers to Mr. Biden are Marianne Williamson, whose last run amounted to an asterisk in the 2020 campaign, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is leveraging his family name to promote his anti-vaccine views.
"Democrats complain that he might be too old," Ms. Cardona added. "But then, when they're asked, 'Well, who?' There is no one else."
Prominent and ambitious governors, including Gavin Newsom of California and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, made clear they would not contest Mr. Biden's nomination, as did the runners-up from 2020. And many party insiders have soured on the political potential of the next-in-line option, Vice President Kamala Harris.
Representative Raúl Grijalva, a former co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said the left was laser-focused on "the fight against the isms: fascism, racism, sexism." That has overshadowed Mr. Biden's age, said the 75-year-old Mr. Grijalva: "I think why it hasn't been a bigger issue is we don't believe in ageism either."
"If we are eliminating people because of how old they are," he said, "I don't think that would be fair and equitable."
Mr. Biden's poll numbers among Democrats remain middling. An NBC News poll this month said 70 percent of all Americans -- including 51 percent of Democrats -- felt that Mr. Biden should not run for a second term. If Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida wins the Republican nomination, the general election contest could be more difficult for Mr. Biden. Mr. DeSantis, 44, has been polling better than Mr. Trump in a hypothetical November matchup.
Privately, some major Biden donors and fund-raisers continue to fret about his durability both in a campaign and a second term. Those who raised or donated $ 1 million or more in 2020 were invited to a private gathering this Friday with the president.
One wealthy donor had considered circulating a letter this year to urge Mr. Biden not to run before the person was dissuaded by associates because it would have been for naught and have served to embarrass Mr. Biden, according to a person familiar with the episode who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. Some contributors have described being in a state of suspended and suppressed angst: fully yet nervously behind Mr. Biden.
Democrats generally and the White House in particular know well the modern history of presidential re-election campaigns and that nearly all the recent incumbents to lose faced serious primary challenges: George H.W. Bush in 1992, Jimmy Carter in 1980, Gerald Ford in 1976 and, before he withdrew and Democrats ultimately lost, Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968.
Combine that pattern with the specter of a second Trump presidency and Democrats have snapped almost uniformly into a loyalist formation, especially after the party averted a red wave and the kind of losses last fall that many had predicted.
"People recognized he was the one candidate who could defeat Donald Trump and protect American democracy," Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who was previously in the Democratic leadership, said of Mr. Biden's nomination in 2020. "It's still the case."
Mr. Biden further smoothed his pathway by pushing through the most substantive change in the Democratic primary calendar in decades. He pushed to shift the first-in-the-nation status on the nominating calendar from Iowa, an overwhelmingly white state with a progressive streak (where Mr. Biden finished in fourth place), to South Carolina, where Black voters resurrected his campaign in 2020.
During his first two years, Mr. Biden built up considerable good will among progressives, embracing many of the left's priorities, including canceling student loan debt, and keeping a far more open line of communication with the party's left-most flank than the previous two Democratic administrations. He has signed landmark bills that have been progressive priorities, including climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act and a temporary child-tax credit.
Some Biden advisers credit the unity task forces created after the 2020 primary as the key starting point. Liberal activists say Ron Klain, the former White House chief of staff, had an unusual open-door policy.
"Bernie wasn't calling up Rahm Emanuel in the early Obama years to talk policy," said Ari Rabin-Havt, a former deputy chief of staff to Senator Bernie Sanders and a Democratic strategist. Of Mr. Biden, he said that most progressives on Capitol Hill would grade him with "an exceeds expectations check mark."
Now Mr. Biden is relying on the left's residual appreciation as he tacks toward the center. He has talked about the need for deficit reduction in 2023, signed a Republican measure to overturn a progressive local Washington crime law and approved a new oil drilling project in Alaska.
"I continue to be frustrated when I see him moving to the center because I don't see a real need to do that," said Mr. Bowman, the New York Democrat. "It's almost like a pandering to a Republican talking point."
In 2020, Representative Eric Swalwell of California briefly ran for president in the Democratic primary and then urged Mr. Biden to "pass the torch" to the next generation. Four years later, Mr. Swalwell is all aboard for a second Biden term, saying the president's ability to pass significant legislation has bound the party together.
"I feared after the 2020 election that it would be impossible for Biden to govern with the thinnest of majorities in the House and Senate," he said. "Instead, Biden has been on a legislative tear, tackling Democratic priorities that had been unachieved for decades."
Many Democrats see Mr. Biden as the party's best chance to limit losses among white voters without college degrees -- the nation's biggest bloc of voters -- a group that Mr. Trump has pulled away from the Democrats.
"Blue-collar workers used to always be our folks," Mr. Biden lamented to donors at a private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in January, highlighting his focus on winning back those voters. "A lot of people think we left them behind," Mr. Biden told the donors. "And it has to do more with attitude and -- than it does with policy."
The relative Democratic success in the midterms -- picking up a Senate seat and only ceding the House to Republicans by five seats -- served as a reminder that despite his own weak polling numbers, Mr. Biden has not hurt his party so far.
"Nothing," Mr. Swalwell said, "unites like success."

The Loss of Innocence Is in the Air: [Style Desk]

Full text: A whiff of strawberry sweetness hits you as soon as you walk into "The Pink Bedroom," an exhibit at the Museum of Sex in New York. The installation is a jumble of shocking pink objects (stuffed animals, makeup compacts, music boxes, shoes and sex toys) arranged around a bed made with pink sheets and pillows. But it also features a mishmash of smells: rose, baby powder and ... is that cat pee?
The artist Portia Munson has exhibited different versions of "The Pink Bedroom," a diorama that explores girlhood and femininity, since 1994. Her show at the Museum of Sex, which runs through July, is the first time the installation has had a signature scent.
It was created by Marissa Zappas, 36, a perfumer in Brooklyn. Ms. Zappas, who has a namesake line, has developed a reputation for creating fragrances with atypical collaborators like sex workers, poets and astrologers, most of whom are women.
"The Pink Bedroom" perfume -- small bottles of which cost $ 45 -- has, in a way, been years in the making: Ms. Zappas first approached Ms. Munson, 62, about working on a project together in 2018. Ms. Zappas loosely modeled the scent after the smell of Cupcake Dolls, a type of fragrant toy popular in the 1990s.
A theme of "The Pink Bedroom" exhibition is the loss of innocence, and Ms. Zappas wanted the perfume to reflect that. To balance the sweetness evoked by its floral and fruity notes, Ms. Zappas added cassis bud, which has an acrid smell that she said is often mistaken for that of cat pee.
"There are these classic pink 'girlie' smells, but then there is also something that feels unsettling, uncomfortable," Ms. Zappas said recently while standing inside "The Pink Bedroom" installation, into which her perfume is pumped through a diffuser.
Ms. Munson said that Ms. Zappas understood "'The Pink Bedroom' is meant to be very seductive and beautiful, but also a little bit too much and a little yucky."
Jane Dashley, who reviews perfumes for Fragraphilia, a fragrance website that she helped found, said that Ms. Zappas specializes in scents that are "uniquely feminine, like a fairy tale, ballerina, bows-and-ribbons kind of feminine." But, Ms. Dashley said, there is a darkness under the surface.
Latex and Leather
In 2019 Ms. Zappas created a fragrance inspired by "Porn Carnival: Paradise Edition," a book of love poems by Rachel Rabbit White. After reading the book, Ms. Zappas contacted Ms. White and the two developed Paradise Edition, a scent with notes of jasmine, orange blossom and salt water.
In 2021, Ms. Zappas released "Wh*re," a perfume inspired by "Whore of New York," a memoir by Liara Roux about her sex work. Ms. Roux said that the fragrance, which smells of cherry, rose and leather, evoked "the nasty, visceral fleshiness and the surreal glamour" of her book.
"I asked her to make a scent that captured the feeling of just having worked -- something that smelled like money, condoms and sex," said Ms. Roux.
Ms. Zappas said that although perfume has a history of being used as a tool of seduction, "sexy" can mean different things -- or smells -- to different people. She is less interested in defining what sex smells like than she is in exploring the ways and reasons people wear perfume. "Sex is a major one," she added.
A fragrance called Annabel's Birthday Cake, with notes of whipped cream and latex, is her most popular, Ms. Zappas said. She created it with her friend Annabel Gat, an astrologer who was born one day after Ms. Zappas.
Ms. Zappas runs her business from her apartment in Brooklyn, where part of her living room has become a perfume lab. Small bottles and vials of aroma chemicals cover the desk where she works, and just a few feet away is a stripper pole, which Ms. Zappas installed after a breakup. "Dancing really helps take me back into my body and not think so much," she said.
While discussing what led her to become a perfumer, Ms. Zappas plunked a framed photo of the actress Elizabeth Taylor down onto a coffee table. The picture was from a collection that she said at one point totaled some 1,200 photos of the actress, whose eyes were the inspiration for a pair of tattoos Ms. Zappas has on her inner arms.
Ms. Zappas became fascinated with Taylor as a child, after seeing "National Velvet." When she later learned of Taylor's foray into the fragrance business, Ms. Zappas said it intensified her interest in perfume.
Ms. Zappas, who was born in Southern California and raised in the Bay Area, said she has been obsessed with scents since childhood, when she would spend time at a fig orchard planted by her father.
She moved to New York City in 2011, to study at the New School. In early 2015, she started a temp job as a receptionist at the New York office of Givaudan, a fragrance company that has developed perfumes for Coach, Estée Lauder and Tom Ford, among others.
During that job, Ms. Zappas applied for an apprenticeship with one of Givaudan's master perfumers, Olivier Gillotin. At the time she applied for the apprenticeship, Ms. Zappas was studying cemetery construction. "I was learning about the history of deodorization," she said.
Mr. Gillotin said her studies were much different from anyone else's he had met working in the industry. She began her apprenticeship with him around the time of her graduation in 2015. When it ended, he advised her to strike out on her own, telling her then that she could make more of a mark on the industry from the outside than the inside.

Most of Ms. Zappas's perfumes are produced in limited quantities and start at about $ 150 a bottle. She also takes commissions for custom fragrances, a service that starts at about $ 4,000 a bottle (refills cost about $ 200).
To develop a custom perfume, Ms. Zappas probes clients' memories for scent associations. "This is my favorite part, learning about their specific memories from childhood, like what foods their mother made, or what their backyard smells like," she said.
Sera Gamble, a creator of the Netflix series "You," commissioned a perfume last July after discovering Ms. Zappas's products on Instagram. "I was so taken with the idea that she collaborates with poets and astrologers," Ms. Gamble, 39, said.
The fragrance is still in development. "Perfume is ideally slow," Ms. Zappas said.
She is also working on "Maggie the Cat is Alive, I'm Alive!," a perfume with notes of violets, peaches and champagne. The name is from dialogue by Elizabeth Taylor in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof."
"I'm finally feeling more settled, with enough confidence to make a fragrance worthy of her," Ms. Zappas said.
She added, "Quite honestly, I just feel alive."

Full text: Eureka! After California's Heavy Rains, Gold Seekers Are Giddy.
We're exploring how America defines itself one place at a time. In Northern California, prospectors are looking to strike gold after the winter storms, recalling a storied era in state history.
PLACERVILLE, Calif. -- Albert Fausel spends his days at the family hardware store sorting through boxes of bolts and pacing the old, creaking floorboards to greet his loyal clientele. But on a recent sunny afternoon, he threw on his wet suit and diver's mask and inserted himself face down in the shallow creek near his home.
An amateur gold seeker, Mr. Fausel used his gloved fingers to sweep aside the sand and gravel at the bottom of the creek and then, still under water, let out a cry that was audible through the tube of his snorkel: "Woooo-hoo-hoooo!"
He emerged with what gold seekers call a picker -- not quite a nugget, but big enough to pinch in your fingers -- and he delicately handed the glinting object to his fellow prospector, a friend with a long white beard who goes by Uncle Fuzzy. In just 20 minutes of rooting around the creek bed, Mr. Fausel had found about $ 100 worth of gold.
There's a fever in California's gold country these days, the kind that comes with the realization that nature is unlocking another stash of precious metal. California's prodigious winter rainfall blasted torrents of water through mountain streams and rivers. And as the warmer weather melts the massive banks of snow -- one research station in the Sierra recorded 60 feet for the season -- the rushing waters are detaching and carrying gold deposits along the way. The immense wildfires of recent years also loosened the soil, helping to push downstream what some here are calling flood gold.
It has been nearly 175 years since the Gold Rush that drew countless wagons and ships filled with prospectors, but the foothills of the Sierra Nevada are still home to a quirky group of gold seekers, heavy on beards and flannel, who pore over old maps for the site of a now-vanished saloon or walk the back country searching for nuggets and other artifacts.
Placerville is a 15-minute drive from the valley where James Marshall, a carpenter from New Jersey, was building a sawmill in January 1848 along the American River when something shiny in the water caught his eye. "Some kind of mettle," wrote one of his workers in his diary in the quirky spellings of the time, "that looks like goald."
The big chunks of the easy-to-find gold that had been lolling around in rivers for millenniums were gone after the first years of the Gold Rush, and Marshall himself died penniless. But miners resorted to spraying powerful jets of water onto hillsides and sorting through what flowed down, leaving giant piles of mining residue still visible today.
That kind of extraction is now heavily restricted in California, yet gold seekers say the recent battering of successive winter storms has produced a similar effect. It is as if Mother Nature had aimed a pressure washer onto the hills and delivered some of the precious minerals still embedded in the rock and dirt.
"Anytime you can stand next to a river, and you hear the boulders tumbling, you know the gold is moving, too," said Jim Eakin, the owner of a local firewood business who tells the story of finding a nugget so big four years ago that he bought a brand-new Ford F-150 pickup truck with cash. Like many of his gold-seeking friends, Mr. Eakin, who often wears a nugget around his neck, is cagey when asked about exactly where he unearthed the chunk of gold that got him the truck.
"Somewhere north of Los Angeles, south of Seattle and west of Denver," he said.
Mr. Eakin, whose gravelly voice betrays the pack and a half of cigarettes he smokes daily, does not own a computer and has never sent a text message. He revels in the hunt for treasure. He finds coins of all sizes and Gold-Rush-era belt buckles, and he travels to a big gem show in Tucson, Ariz., to sell his nuggets. It is a hobby that requires a lot of patience: For every big find, there are many days where -- to use a gold-mining expression -- things don't pan out.
With the price of gold hovering near highs of $ 2,000 an ounce, Mr. Eakin counts himself among a group of gold seekers who can "read the ground" and profit from the fortuitous winter weather.
"It's going to be a magnificent year," said Tony Watley, president of the Gold Country Treasure Seekers club, which meets at the American Legion hall the third Monday of every month. "Everywhere we are seeing new erosion."
The Treasure Seekers get-togethers feature a show-and-tell portion where members display their finds on fold-up tables. Those who attended the March meeting were agog when someone laid out two pounds of gold nuggets he had found with a metal detector, the method preferred by most of the club's members.
"There was $ 50,000 of gold up at that table," said Mark Dayton, a regular at the club. "We've had more gold in the last two meetings than I've seen in the last two years."
Mr. Dayton, a former police officer and firefighter, now makes a living as a treasure hunter. In just a few outings in April, he found $ 750 worth of gold pieces. Gold seekers like him predict the best is yet to come, when the river levels recede and the rocks and sandbars become accessible.
There is no shortage of reminders that Placerville, the seat of El Dorado County about an hour east of Sacramento, is gold country. In and around the town there is Gold Country Chiropractic, the Gold Trail School, the Gold Hill Winery, the 49er liquor store, and the Gold Harvest Market on Mother Lode Drive.
Placerville, once a stop along the Pony Express trail and known as Hangtown because of the vigilante justice once meted out there, trades on its Gold Rush history. Mr. Fausel's store, Placerville Hardware, lays claim to being the oldest continuously operating hardware store west of the Mississippi River. It sells gold panning equipment like sluice boxes, plastic pans with ridges to trap gold, metal detectors and small glass vials to preserve any pickers and flakes that amateur prospectors might find.
For travelers headed to Lake Tahoe, Placerville is not much more than an inconvenient stoplight or two along the main highway. And young people these days seeking fortunes would sooner head to the Silicon Valley than pick up a gold pan.
Today's gold seekers range from part-time hobbyists keen to spend an afternoon by the river to the die-hard, well-equipped treasure hunters who make a living from it. Gold shops in the area buy the gold and either melt it down or in some cases convert it into jewelry.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Dayton was accompanied along the Cosumnes River by a friend, Barron Brandon, a former mining executive and an amateur gold seeker in retirement. The two men hacked away at rocks and sand in a crevice between boulders. One of Mr. Dayton's metal detectors squawked loudly and, after further digging, they unearthed what had excited the machine: a worthless piece of rebar.
Mr. Brandon showed no sign of disappointment. He stood near the rushing river, the rolling hills covered in white oaks, the pristine creeks flowing gently beside grassy knolls dotted with wildflowers. "The true gold is just being out here," he said.
James Holifield, a high school student who lives in a Sacramento suburb, came to the banks of the American River on his last day of spring break, inspired by some videos on YouTube. "There's something about gold," he said, looking the part in a flannel shirt and rubber boots that covered his shins.
After two hours he had found four flakes of gold. His mother, sitting in a portable chair a few yards back from the river, said she was grateful that her son had chosen a "low-investment" hobby.
And watching him pan for gold, she said, beats seeing him glued to his phone.

Full text: With the release of "Guy Ritchie's The Covenant," here's a look at the occasional phenomenon of directors branding movies with their own names.
He turned Will Smith into a cerulean genie for the 2019 live-action "Aladdin" and twice reimagined Sherlock Holmes as a swashbuckling rogue, to hefty box-office returns. As a filmmaker, though, Guy Ritchie has long been synonymous with sprawling ensemble pictures like "Snatch," "The Gentlemen" and "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels": laddish, kinetic crime capers larded with movie stars, bloodied knuckles and inscrutable Cockney accents. (The latest of such outings, an antic international spy lark called "Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre" featuring Jason Statham, Hugh Grant and Aubrey Plaza, arrived to middling fanfare this past March.)
So why is "Guy Ritchie's The Covenant," a somber-looking Afghanistan war drama about an American sergeant (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his Afghan interpreter (Dar Salim), the first of the director's 15 features to formally bear his name? The answer, according to its U.S. distributor, MGM, turns out to be fairly prosaic: Another company had already asserted rights to the title. ("Lee Daniels' The Butler," produced by the Weinstein Company, faced a similar challenge in court from Warner Brothers in 2013 and lost, precipitating a hasty last-minute change.)
But this kind of déjà vu is hardly new: Broad-strokes monikers like "Crash," "Heat" and "Rush" have all done double duty over the last few decades; "Twilight" is the name of both a poorly received 1998 neo-noir starring Paul Newman and Susan Sarandon and the 2008 teen-vampire juggernaut that launched four fanged, lugubrious sequels, as well as a cult 1990 mystery by the Hungarian filmmaker György Fehér. (Ritchie might have called his latest‌ ‌ "The Interpreter" instead, had that appellation not already been claimed by a 2005 Sydney Pollack political thriller starring Nicole Kidman; so back, alas, to the drawing board.)
If the back story of "The Covenant" wanders into the weeds of copyright law, "Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio," which won the Academy Award for best animated feature last month, makes an easier case for its qualifier: Without it, the movie could hardly be set apart from both the 1940 Disney classic still widely seen as definitive and an uncanny remake led by Tom Hanks -- it currently sits at a grim 29 percent approval rating on the critical-aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes -- released less than two months before.
In a larger sense, though, the inclusion of del Toro's name also serves as shorthand and a promise, portending not only the age-old tale of a wooden boy made real but the particular vision of its maker -- a lush, prolific fantasist famed for the distinctive visual style and dazzling gothic grotesqueries of films like "Pan's Labyrinth" (2006) and the best picture-winning "The Shape of Water" (2017). That del Toro actually split directing duties for "his" "Pinocchio" with Mark Gustafson seems almost a footnote. Though Gustafson, an industry journeyman with a wide range of writing and animation credits ("Fantastic Mr. Fox," the original California Raisins), shared both the stage and the statuette with del Toro at this year's Oscars ceremony, it's the latter's renown, by most Hollywood metrics, that matters.
With "Pinocchio" and the 2022 Netflix horror-anthology series "Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities," the director joins a long line of auteurs, from Alfred Hitchcock to Tim Burton, whose presence not merely above the title but in it serves as a stylistic marker, even when it's not strictly their hand guiding the material. (The horror godhead Wes Craven habitually did the same; see "Wes Craven's New Nightmare.") Few, though, can claim to be the one-man industry that is Tyler Perry, who retains full ownership of the projects produced under his personal shingle at his stand-alone studio in Atlanta. The multihyphenate creator has famously put‌‌ his signature on several movie and television titles released under its umbrella -- including "Tyler Perry's A Madea Homecoming," the most recent iteration of the reliably raucous comedies that he also writes and stars in as a salty, well-cushioned matriarch of a certain age.
While Madea is Perry's wholesale creation, indubitably linked to the man who wears her wig onscreen, certain intellectual properties with roots that reach back centuries have tilted their brims instead toward a more literal (and literary) acknowledgment of the source. Think of the high-gloss 1990s productions "Bram Stoker's Dracula" (directed by Francis Ford Coppola) and "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (directed by Kenneth Branagh): It takes both the budget and the personal leverage of a prestige director, one presumes, to lay claim to the definitive versions of characters who have long been turned over to the public domain. Neither movie did much service to these iconic novels, but show business, as always, carries on: Coppola's four-decades-in-the-making passion project "Megalopolis," which wrapped shooting several weeks ago, was funded in part, he has publicly said, by his long-ago work on "Bram Stoker's Dracula." And Branagh, having recently mined his own Irish childhood for the dewy black-and-white drama "Belfast" (which won him an Oscar for original screenplay), will next direct and star as Hercule Poirot in his third Agatha Christie adaptation in six years, "A Haunting in Venice," due this September. Neither he nor Christie is officially billed in the title.

Price Increases Pad Procter & Gamble's Profits: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The company raised prices 10 percent across its consumer brands for a second straight quarter and said its profit margin had widened.
Another round of price increases on household products like Gillette razors, Dawn dish soap and Swiffer dusters bolstered Procter & Gamble's bottom line last quarter, the company said on Friday, a sign that stubborn inflation may linger as companies defend their profit margins.
Procter & Gamble, a consumer goods bellwether, said its profit grew in the first three months of the year after it raised prices 10 percent across its brands. That rise was the company's second consecutive quarter of double-digit increases. Its profit margin expanded in the quarter, with price increases more than offsetting the rise in what it paid for raw materials.
Revenue rose 4 percent last quarter from a year earlier, even as sales volumes -- the number of rolls of Charmin toilet paper and boxes of Tide detergent -- fell 3 percent as consumers traded down to less expensive alternatives or bought less. In other words, Procter & Gamble made more money even though it sold fewer products. Sales volumes at the company have declined in the past four quarters.
"Consumer package goods companies are a relatively small part of what contributes to the overall level of inflation," said Sucharita Kodali, a retail trends analyst at Forrester, a research and advisory company. But, she added, they "contribute very much to the perception of inflation." Customers do not buy cars or houses every day, but many do notice price increases on frequent trips to the grocery store.
Jon Moeller, Procter & Gamble's chief executive, said in a statement that the company had delivered strong results "in what continues to be a very difficult cost and operating environment."
The company also raised its revenue forecast for this fiscal year to a 1 percent rise over the prior year; its previous forecast was a range of flat to a 1 percent drop. And it said it planned to buy back up to $ 8 billion of its own stock in its current fiscal year, which ends in June.
Procter & Gamble shares closed more than 3 percent higher on Friday.
Americans continued to spend in recent months even as companies passed along higher prices, but there are signs that consumers are starting to pull back: U.S. retail sales declined 1 percent in March from the previous month.
Inflation overall has moderated, climbing 5 percent over the year through March, down from a peak of near 9 percent in the summer. The deceleration has been prolonged and uneven, partly because companies find they can maintain higher prices, especially by pitching their offerings as premium products.
Procter & Gamble even had its own term for its products' high value -- "irresistible superiority" -- which was used several times on a conference call with analysts.
Consumers are getting more careful with spending, Andre Schulten, the company's chief financial officer, said on the call. "That just means we need to double down on our view of what superiority in some of our lower-value tiers means," he added. That may include communicating the value and quality of products to consumers.
Other consumer products makers have had similar results after increasing prices. In February, PepsiCo said it would not raise its prices further after multiple rounds of increases helped it achieve better-than-expected results in its fourth quarter. And Unilever said this year that it would continue to raise prices but ease the increases in the second half of the year.
Higher prices can frustrate consumers, said Ms. Kodali, the Forrester analyst. Brand loyalists, or "inelastic customers," are likely to keep buying products at higher prices, but other customers have already changed their shopping habits -- as evidenced by Procter & Gamble's decrease in sales volume.
A customer turned off by rising prices for Pampers disposable diapers, for example, might start using cloth alternatives instead. That customer will be hard for Procter & Gamble to win back.
Higher prices may be good for corporate profits, but they have complicated the Federal Reserve's efforts to tame inflation by cooling the economy via a series of interest rate increases that started last year. Late last month, the Fed raised its benchmark rate to a range of 4.75 to 5 percent, up from near zero just over a year ago.
In Europe, policymakers have warned that companies' lifting prices above what is necessary to absorb higher costs could be fueling inflation. Policymakers have long been concerned with the wage-price spiral, in which higher wages push companies to raise prices to compensate for salary increases.
Now, the so-called profit-price spiral may be a risk, too. An executive board member at the European Central Bank warned last month that half of domestic price pressures in the eurozone in the fourth quarter of last year had come from company profits.
Executives at Procter & Gamble acknowledged on the call with analysts that there were still challenges ahead, like higher operating costs and wage increases.
There are "many headwinds that we're working against and will continue to work against as we move forward," Mr. Moeller said.

Tesla's Quarterly Profit Drops After a Series of Price Cuts: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The electric carmaker has reduced prices by thousands of dollars this year to bolster demand and fend off competition.
Tesla's profit fell sharply in the first three months of the year after it cut the prices of its electric vehicles, the company said on Wednesday.
The carmaker, led by Elon Musk, said it had made $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter, a drop from $ 3.7 billion in the last three months of last year and $ 3.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022.
Tesla sold more electric cars in the United States last year than all its competitors combined. But its market share slipped as traditional carmakers like General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen began selling electric cars that often undercut Tesla on price. In China, Tesla has been overtaken by BYD. Tesla's product line has not changed much, which can be a big disadvantage as rivals attract buyers with alluring new models.
To try to maintain its hold on the market, Tesla has made a series of price cuts this year across its four models. Because it has much wider profit margins than other automakers, the company is in theory in a strong position in a price war.
But the price cuts appear to be quickly eating into those margins. In the first quarter, the gross margin that measures the profitability of Tesla's auto business, excluding revenue from selling clean-energy credits, was 19 percent, down from nearly 27 percent for all of 2022.
The average selling price for Tesla's vehicles in the first quarter of this year was nearly $ 46,000, down from $ 51,400 in the last quarter of 2022. But despite that 11 percent decline, Tesla's vehicle deliveries were only 4 percent higher.
In a conference call to discuss the company's quarterly results, Mr. Musk said Tesla's profit margin remained among the highest in the industry. "We're taking a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here," he said, "versus a lower volume and a higher margin."
On the call, Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla's chief financial officer, was asked to provide a 2023 forecast for the gross margin in Tesla's auto business, but he said doing so would be difficult because of economic uncertainty.
Tesla said it expected to sell 1.8 million cars in 2023, up from 1.3 million last year.
The company's adjusted per-share profits of 85 cents were in line with the expectations of Wall Street analysts, and its stock was down about 4 percent in extended trading on Wednesday. Tesla's shares are up nearly 50 percent this year but still down 56 percent from their high, reached in 2021. The stock came under pressure last year partly because Mr. Musk sold billions of dollars of Tesla shares to help finance his acquisition of Twitter.
Competition will intensify this year as traditional carmakers expand their electric lineups. Volkswagen's ID.4, a sport utility vehicle, starts at about $ 39,000, less than the $ 47,000 starting price for Tesla's Model Y S.U.V.
G.M. plans to begin selling an electric version of its Equinox S.U.V. for around $ 30,000, as well as electric versions of the Silverado pickup truck and Blazer S.U.V.
Investors have been waiting for Tesla to respond with new vehicles. The company has promised to begin selling the Cybertruck pickup this year, although it won't be available in large numbers until 2024. On Wednesday, Mr. Musk said the company was expecting a "delivery event" for the Cybertruck in the third quarter of this year.
"This is really a very radical product," he said. "It's not made in the way that other cars are made."
There is also speculation that Tesla will unveil a car priced below the Model 3 sedan, which starts at $ 39,990 before government incentives.
The company's strategy of cutting prices to shore up demand also risks offending Tesla owners by reducing the resale value of their cars. Prices for used Teslas have plunged in recent months.
Tesla's sales, like those of all carmakers, have been affected by rising interest rates, which make car payments more expensive for buyers. But Tesla has also been bolstered by changes in tax credits that electric cars receive in the United States.
Because it already makes batteries in the United States, Tesla had an easier time qualifying for new rules that took effect on Tuesday and determine which vehicles qualify for a $ 7,500 tax credit. To be eligible, the batteries must be made with lithium and other minerals mined or processed by a U.S. trade ally, and with battery components made in the United States, Canada or Mexico.
Tesla also sells solar panels, batteries for home power storage, and large batteries used by electric producers and distributors to store solar and wind power. Mr. Musk said this month that Tesla would build a factory in Shanghai with the aim of assembling 10,000 of the giant batteries annually.

Car Show Flaunts China's Switch to Electric: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Shanghai auto show, the largest in China since before the pandemic, had one theme: The dominance of electric vehicles in the world's largest car market is here to stay.
A hall showing off electric vehicles made by Nio, XPeng Motors, Zeekr and dozens of other Chinese companies was mobbed with visitors. An area nearby full of gasoline-powered cars by foreign brands barely got a second look by anyone.
At the same event, Volkswagen, which vies with Toyota to be the world's biggest seller of cars with combustion engines, issued a bold forecast: Within two years, half the cars sold in China, the world's largest automobile market, will be electric, up from only 6 percent in 2020.
The theme at the Shanghai auto show this week was clear. Electric cars are here to stay, and Chinese automakers are leading the field.
Silvio Pietro Angori, the chief executive and managing director of Pininfarina of Italy, a nearly century-old car design business, said the global industry was not going back.
The internal combustion engine, he said, "is done, it's gone, it doesn't exist any more."
The Shanghai auto show is one of the world's biggest, and the first of its size in China since 2019. During the pandemic, when China's borders were sealed because of "zero Covid" precautions, its auto industry was quietly transformed and the market share of foreign companies shrank. Today half the cars sold in Shanghai itself are already electric.
Brian Gu, the president and vice chairman of Xpeng, said his company planned to reduce the cost of building a powertrain -- primarily the battery and electric motor -- by 25 percent by the end of the year. Powertrains, particularly the batteries, make up about two-fifths of Xpeng's overall cost of building an electric car.
Ashwani Gupta, the chief operating officer of Nissan, one-upped Xpeng, saying his company's latest designs would cut powertrain costs by 30 percent. Shohei Yamazaki, the chairman of Nissan's China investments subsidiary, said Nissan would rely heavily on Chinese suppliers.
"Price competition in China is very fierce right now," he said.
Chinese brands have adopted unusual electric car designs while foreign companies and their Chinese joint ventures have played it safe. The wheels are nearly at the corners of the Chinese brand cars, an architecture that also allows more room for batteries under the floor in the middle. Nio and Xpeng have chosen sleek designs, while Changan, based in western China, is making cars so rectangular that they look faintly Cubist.
"Some of that comes from the freedom from legacy," said Felix Kilbertus, the chief creative officer at Pininfarina.
Great Wall, a Chinese maker of sport utility vehicles, has a new electric car brand, Ora, that is targeted to women. It named car models for cats, partly to appeal to lovers of the Hello Kitty brand. It has an electric car that strongly resembles a Volkswagen Beetle.
The main market for electric cars so far is China -- E.V.s were a quarter of China's market last year, compared with less than 6 percent in the United States.
Most of the cars displayed at the auto show use lithium batteries, the current industry standard, though companies are developing vehicles that run fully or partly on batteries made of sodium.
At the moment, there is a glut of lithium batteries, but long term many in the industry believe sodium can become a viable alternative or supplement to lithium as a key ingredient in E.V. batteries. For one thing, the production of sodium batteries would be better for the climate.
Toyota's chief scientist, Gill Pratt, contended at a session of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January that overall greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced more by replacing 90 gasoline cars with hybrid cars than by using the same amount of scarce lithium to build one battery-electric car.
"If you think about the total amount of lithium that the world has, the key is let's use it where it does the most good," he said.
Toyota has a vested interest in questioning the availability of lithium. It owns many key patents for hybrid cars, and has emphasized them over entirely electric cars that require far more lithium. American and European automakers like Ford Motor and Volkswagen, as well as most Chinese automakers, are still betting on battery-electric cars.
Prototype cars with all-sodium batteries that were disclosed in recent weeks by Chinese domestic carmakers and battery manufacturers have been low-budget microcars. One of them, the Sihao Huaxianzi from JAC Motors, in collaboration with HiNA, a sodium battery start-up, is designed for a top speed of 75 miles an hour.
Pulkit Khurana, a co-founder of Battery Smart, an Indian company that provides batteries for three-wheeled auto rickshaws, expressed doubt that any technology, including sodium, would displace conventional lithium batteries soon. And with the price of lithium having dropped by two-thirds since November, the cost of lithium batteries is likely to drop significantly, he said.
A midsize car or sport utility vehicle would have enough room for a far larger sodium battery than the low-cost subcompacts that Chinese manufacturers are initially building. Another possibility is to use a combination of sodium and lithium cells in a single car battery.
Using an artificial intelligence computer program, China's CATL, the world's largest manufacturer of electric car batteries, has figured out the complex electronics and programming for battery packs with some lithium cells and some sodium cells, said Huang Qisen, the deputy dean of company's research institute.
CATL -- the company's full name is Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. -- said at the auto show that it would make sodium battery cars in cooperation with Chery, a Chinese automaker that is strongest in manufacturing low-cost subcompacts. But both companies declined to provide any details.
Switching to sodium could solve one of the biggest problems with lithium batteries, which put out much less electricity in freezing temperatures.
Because of chemical differences between sodium and lithium, a sodium battery loses less than a tenth of its power at very cold temperatures, according to battery chemistry experts.
"It is promising," said Ouyang Chuying, the president of research and development at CATL. "Sodium has no resource limit."

Is That a TV on the Dashboard?: [Style Desk]

Full text: As luxury cars become rolling supercomputers, designers are wondering how big is too big.
From pocket-stretching smartphones to wall-hogging TVs, Americans have often asked: How much screen is too much?
The question has come to today's gadget-stuffed cars, whose increasingly colossal screens are splitting opinions among designers, car buyers and industry critics. These do-it-all touch screens, the nerve centers of many new cars, have sparked a backlash because of their size, as well as the clunky interfaces that may take eyes off the road.
"I think we've reached Peak Screen," said Klaus Busse, Maserati's head of design, who previously led design for Alfa Romeo, Fiat and Lancia. "Screens have their right of existence -- they do a lot of things better than physical switches. It's just been pushed a little too far."
Beyond having ergonomic and safety concerns, some luxury designers object on aesthetic grounds. To them, screens just aren't sexy or luxurious.
"When flat screens showed up, the-bigger-the-better was the trend," said Kai Langer, head of design for BMW i, the automaker's electric division. "But 'bigger' isn't always the richest."
Screens are now integral to most modern cars, which are more or less rolling supercomputers, running up to 14 times more code than a Boeing 787. And designers must keep in mind the demands of car owners who expect that their Apple or Android smartphones will hook up flawlessly.
"Steve Jobs changed the world, and now mankind touches a screen," said Gorden Wagener, the chief designer for Mercedes-Benz. "That fundamentally changes the car as well. The car needs a good interface, not just a wiper switch and turn indicator."
When Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Model S in 2009, the command center, with its 17-inch LCD touch screen, seemed nearly as game-changing as the car itself. And in giving drivers digital control of automotive functions, Tesla was able to avoid the expense of engineering, wiring and building a cabin full of pricey analog switches, knobs and gauges -- or having to buy them from another automaker or supplier.
In Tesla's bare-bones Model 3 and Model Y especially, one might suspect that interior designers worked overtime on their ingenious screens and then called it a day. A number of Tesla's competitors mimicked the cabins' austere, vaguely sci-fi vibe.
The creators of later electric vehicles -- including BMW's futuristic yet sumptuous iX and the Kia EV6 -- came up with warmer car interiors better suited to drivers who may not want to feel as if they are spending hours inside the mainframe from "Tron." Some designers are even ditching that most played-out of E.V. tropes, the Mac-like monochromes of gray-silver-white.
With its expanded touch screen, Tesla also spurred an arms race measured in inches. Ford stuffed a 15.5-inch screen into its Mustang Mach-e and F-150 Lightning E.V.s. The start-up Rivian has installed a 16-inch display in the R1T and R1S models. Another California company, Lucid, created a 34-inch, curved-glass screen for the Air sedan.
And then there is the "Hyperscreen," from Mercedes-Benz.
Powered by eight processors, framed under a sculptural slab of double-coated glass, the Hyperscreen (actually three screens that appear as one) spreads 56 inches of digital interface across the dashboard. Augmented-reality navigation generates virtual street signs and directional guides over the pavement in a real-time camera view. Almost magically, virtual address numbers hover over homes and businesses as you approach a destination.
Yet the Hyperscreen doesn't always work as elegantly as it looks -- especially when drivers are, well, driving. Issues include fussy thumb-pad controls on the steering wheel and moments of hair-pulling confusion, especially for customers who grew up with predigital rides. Mr. Wagener said that Mercedes intentionally launched its Hyperscreen in its electric vehicles to aim it at tech-savvy customers.
BMW is no stranger to screens, having ushered in iDrive more than 20 years ago on the 7-Series sedan. That digital operating system, with a now-quaint 6.5-inch screen atop the dashboard, infuriated many drivers because it was so hard to use. But as BMW refined it over the years, rival car companies adopted similar systems.
The i7 sedan, a new electric model from BMW, wraps a curved screen around the driver. The back of the car offers a 31-inch, fold-down theater touch screen, with 5G connectivity and Amazon Fire for streaming. Another 5.5-inch screen nestles into each rear armrest.
At the annual CES in Las Vegas in January, BMW threw down that gauntlet by going well beyond the touch screen. In the iVision Dee, a concept sedan that previews a range of BMW "Neue Klasse" E.V.s -- the first scheduled to arrive in 2025 -- the windshield itself takes the place of a dashboard touch screen.
"Let's use the biggest display we already have in a car, which is the windshield," Mr. Langer, the BMW design chief, said.
The augmented-reality windshield allows for "Minority Report"-style projections of traditional gauges (speedometer; temperature settings; audio displays) and social-and-streaming content. The system, which BMW will call Panoramic Vision on showroom models, greatly expands the head-up displays that project content into the field of view, allowing drivers to check the controls without looking away from the road.
For those leery of astral projections blocking their view of I-95, Mr. Langer said that drivers could choose any display level. A "mixed reality slider" can limit traditional information, such as a speedometer, to a thin strip of lower windshield, where today's head-up displays already operate. Drivers more at ease with digital projections can fill more of the windshield glass with content. When the car isn't moving, including during charging stops, passengers may eventually use the entire windshield like a virtual drive-in for movies, games, Zoom meetings or trips to the metaverse.
At the convention in Las Vegas, the BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said he was convinced that regulators would eventually ban large dashboard screens because of safety concerns. "If you have to look down to operate your car, we think it's a big mistake," he told Automotive News Europe.
Mr. Langer noted that prominent screens do not appear in the pages of high-end shelter or architectural magazines. "None of our consumers would want to cover their living room in screens," he said. "They want their Eames chair or Nelson clock. And we want our customers to feel at home."
And if touch screens shrink or even disappear from cars' cabins, designers will be free to reclaim the interiors for something more aesthetically pleasing. "A touch screen doesn't speak to our senses," Mr. Langer said. "We're made to touch fabrics and sense different surfaces; that's what makes us human."
Some of the iVision Dee's fanciful tech -- including a chameleon-like body that can instantly change to one of 32 colors -- may be ditched or watered down in production versions. Yet BMW vows the panoramic display is bound for showrooms.
Mercedes-Benz is skeptical. While it offers head-up displays, it is convinced that windshield projections "are light-years behind the quality and resolution you can achieve on a screen," Mr. Wagener said.
"It's certainly an innovative approach," he continued. "But we've tried it, and it's disturbing or disorienting to have all that in your viewing area."
Maserati is steering a middle course with its GranTurismo. Its interior includes a pair of screens that don't draw attention to themselves.
"We don't want a screen to be the main protagonist," Mr. Busse, the Maserati design chief, said.
In his view, the car is a refuge from the digital world and its pressures.
"For us," he said, "it's still about the driving experience -- to enjoy this beautiful machine and the countryside where you're operating it."

If It's Domestic and Electric, China's Car Buyers Want to Own It: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Domestic companies are now selling more vehicles than their multinational rivals, which have failed to keep up with Chinese consumers' demand for electric cars and S.U.V.s.
For years, foreign automakers in China had a bead on customers drawn to luxury brands, like the Cao family in Shanghai. Not anymore.
Ben Cao and his wife, Rachel, both 36, are trading down from two Porsches to one, a gasoline-fueled $ 290,000 Porsche 911 sports car, and buying their first electric vehicle, a $ 70,000 sport utility vehicle designed and manufactured in China by a company called Li Auto.
"If you're sitting in a Li Auto, the first feeling is of luxury," said Mr. Cao, a business consultant.
The rapid rise of Chinese electric carmakers like Li Auto, BYD, Nio and Xpeng Motors is the main preoccupation of the executives, engineers and designers arriving in Shanghai for the start of the city's auto show next Tuesday. The country is now the world's largest car market, and the home teams are routing multinational competitors that had until now mined the riches of China's giant pool of customers. Buyers like the Caos, and China's car companies, have embraced electric vehicles much more rapidly than almost anyone anticipated.
The rise of Chinese auto companies, often subsidized by local governments in cities where they have factories, is another illustration of the country's dominance in electric cars. China now manufactures and sells -- at home and abroad -- most of the world's electric cars. Its prowess extends to the entire value chain for electric cars: It makes almost all of the cars' electric motors and refines most of the chemicals used for lithium batteries. China even leads in developing what could be the next generation of technology, sodium batteries.
More than 80 percent of the electric cars sold in China last year were made by domestic automakers. Last autumn, they overtook multinational companies in the total number of gasoline-powered or electric cars sold each month.
"Multinationals' market share in China will likely continue to decrease due to the continuous development of Chinese automakers, especially in the electric car segment," said Stephen W. Dyer, a managing director in the Shanghai office of Alix Partners, a consulting firm.
As foreign automakers encounter problems in China, they are being pushed to shift more quickly to electric cars in Europe and the United States. The European Union and California want automakers to sell only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. And the Biden administration this week proposed emissions rules that would effectively require about two-thirds of new passenger cars sold in the United States to be electric by 2032 -- standards that some automakers have complained are too stringent.
With a couple of exceptions like Tesla, which China welcomed in 2018 for its technology, Beijing has compelled foreign companies to operate through joint ventures with Chinese automakers. Over the past four decades, multinational companies have trained an entire generation of Chinese auto engineers -- many of whom now work for highly competitive domestic rivals.
Today the number of cars sold by the foreign companies' joint ventures has plummeted as sales of gasoline-powered vehicles have shrunk and E.V.s have soared. Electric cars were almost a quarter of China's market last year, compared with less than 6 percent in the United States, and are expected to be over a third by the end of this year.
Ford Motor sold one million cars and light trucks in China in 2016 and in 2017 but barely 400,000 last year. Hyundai Motor, the South Korean giant, sold 1.8 million cars in China in 2016 and only 385,000 last year.
General Motors, which once vied with Germany's Volkswagen for market leadership, has lost nearly half its sales in China. G.M. would be faring even worse if not for Wuling, a joint venture in which G.M. has a 44 percent stake. Wuling sells ultra-cheap pickup trucks and microvans that cost $ 4,800 to $ 21,800 and have slender profit margins.
The market share of China's domestic car companies rose to 52 percent in the last quarter of 2022, from 47 percent the year before, largely on a huge rise in electric vehicle sales. The best-selling brand is BYD, in which Warren E. Buffett was an early investor. It now holds 10.3 percent of the car market, up from 2.1 percent four years ago and supplanting the Volkswagen brand as China's leader.
Volkswagen has also lost share, although less so than most foreign automakers. It plans to hold the worldwide introduction of its new ID.7 electric sedan in Shanghai on Monday.
A Volkswagen spokesman said the company had already doubled sales of its ID. series of electric cars last year, and was refusing to cut prices like some competitors just to maintain the number of cars sold. G.M. plans to introduce four new electric vehicles this year in China for its Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet brands, and plans to convert more than half its factory capacity in China to electric cars by 2030.
Volkswagen is so concerned about the China market that it chartered two flights from Germany to Shanghai to bring board members of the Volkswagen Group and its VW, Audi and Porsche brands to the auto show, said a person familiar with the company's plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans were not public. Volkswagen declined to comment on its auto show travel arrangements.
Electric vehicle sales have grown more slowly this year after national subsidies for purchases expired at the end of December. Sales of gasoline-powered cars have plunged as a purchase tax on them has been restored after a suspension during the pandemic.
Tesla, which sells only electric cars, has had slower growth lately than Chinese electric car manufacturers, prompting the company to cut prices. That has set off a wave of discounting. Many consumers have waited to buy cars while watching whether electric car subsidies or purchase tax reductions will be restored.
"The weakness should be short term, because the weak sales were caused by the price chaos in March," said Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association.
Multinational companies including Volkswagen and G.M. had introduced electric cars that looked like their gasoline-powered models, with the hope of achieving a gradual transition. But Chinese consumers have gravitated instead toward the flashiest electric car exteriors and interiors available.
Mr. Cao, the Porsche enthusiast, dismisses most designs of multinational automakers as dull.
"They are far behind, no matter whether it is the U.S. ones and even the German ones," he said. "They don't even seem to be in the same age."
Car fashions change quickly in China. Mr. Cao said that he was active in a 350-member club of Chinese buyers of the Sport Turismo version of the Porsche Panamera sedan, and that he knew of at least 50 others who, like him, were buying the Li Auto L9 sport utility vehicle.
Unlike most large S.U.V.s on the global market, the L9 is electric. It has a small gasoline engine as a backup that can recharge the vehicle's hefty battery pack. But the engine does not provide power to move the vehicle itself.
Mr. Cao said he doubted he would need the backup engine. He plans to drive the S.U.V. for day trips to large parks on the outskirts of Shanghai, recharging it at home each night. Such outings have become popular in China with the end of "zero Covid" quarantines and municipal lockdowns. For longer travel to other cities, he said, he would fly or take one of China's many bullet trains.
Even the maneuvering for choice display locations at auto shows like the one in Shanghai has changed. Until the last several years, Chinese automakers vied to put their displays close to multinational brands like Mercedes-Benz, in the expectation that Chinese car buyers would flock to the multinational brands and might see the local brands along the way.
But now, it's Chinese electric car brands that other companies want to surround on the showroom floor, said Bill Russo, a former chief executive of Chrysler China. "You want to be closer to them -- the Chinese companies have the hottest battery electric vehicles," he said. "Foreign automakers don't have the same halo now."

SHANGHAI — For years, foreign automakers in China had a bead on customers drawn to luxury brands, like the Cao family in Shanghai. Not anymore.
Ben Cao and his wife, Rachel, both 36, are trading down from two Porsches to one, a gasoline-fueled $290,000 Porsche 911 sports car, and buying their first electric vehicle, a $70,000 SUV designed and manufactured in China by a company called Li Auto.
“If you’re sitting in a Li Auto, the first feeling is of luxury,” said Ben Cao, a business consultant.
The rapid rise of Chinese electric carmakers like Li Auto, BYD, Nio and Xpeng Motors is the main preoccupation of the executives, engineers and designers arriving in Shanghai for the start of the city’s auto show Tuesday. The country is now the world’s largest car market, and the home teams are routing multinational competitors that had until now mined the riches of China’s giant pool of customers. Buyers like the Caos, and China’s car companies, have embraced electric vehicles much more rapidly than almost anyone anticipated.
The rise of Chinese auto companies, often subsidized by local governments in cities where they have factories, is another illustration of the country’s dominance in electric cars. China now manufactures and sells — at home and abroad — most of the world’s electric cars. Its prowess extends to the entire value chain for electric cars: It makes almost all of the cars’ electric motors and refines most of the chemicals used for lithium batteries. China even leads in developing what could be the next generation of technology, sodium batteries.
More than 80% of the electric cars sold in China last year were made by domestic automakers. Last autumn, they overtook multinational companies in the total number of gasoline-powered or electric cars sold each month.

For a Literary Man's Man, Mother Knew Best: [Review]

Full text: In his new memoir, "Irma," Terry McDonell, a magazine editor during the golden age of magazines, gives credit to Mom (and Hemingway).
IRMA: The Education of a Mother's Son, by Terry McDonell
The magazine eminence Terry McDonell's first memoir, "The Accidental Life," was a collection of career-centered anecdotes that felt banged out with two fingers on an Olivetti typewriter. Each started with a word count and finished like a sock to the jaw with the insiderly journalistic term "ENDIT." Reviewing that book in 2016, my colleague Dwight Garner noted that it was "light on female personages," adding that the author wasn't "opening his vault or baring his soul."
Seven years later, McDonell has come out with a very personal second memoir, "Irma," that redresses these exact issues. It's named for and nominally centered on his mother: a schoolteacher who raised him after his father, Bob, died in a plane crash while a Navy lieutenant toward the end of World War II, when Terry was 5 months old. In an afterword, McDonell says that the book was originally "going to be about me" -- and it really still is, though you can feel him continually trying to steer it back to Irma, like a car that's out of alignment, in time for its publication right before Mother's Day.
Widowed at 25, Irma was undeniably a heroic, resourceful figure, and a glamorous one, who wore a perfume called Tailspin and drove her small son fast in a maroon Ford convertible to California, the radio playing her favorite song, Doris Day's "Que Sera Sera." She was golden-haired and good-looking -- "slender, with surprising breasts and beautiful legs," McDonell writes, less paging Dr. Freud than putting him on mute -- and encouraged little Terry's interest in nature, teaching him about the birds and the trees.
When he and his fellow Cub Scouts played Cowboys and Indians she made sure to get him books about how the Lakota tribe lived, not just Custer's Last Stand. Their little family moved many, many times but she was reassuringly domestic: sewing him shirts, learning how to deal with artichokes and baking peach pies from scratch.
But waiting at a motel in Santa Clara had been a new boyfriend, Norm, a construction worker who the reader can sense immediately was a real baddie. He advised Terry to kick the neighborhood dogs that chased the boy on his rusty Schwinn Phantom, called him a "pantywaist" on his 9th birthday, grabbed him by his testicles after his 10th and was rumored to have killed a man in Venezuela.
Finding some success as a realtor, Norm showed himself to be anti-Semitic, racist, sexist. He drove drunk, lied, ogled, cheated and finally slapped Irma so hard she fell. By then a jocky teen, Terry retaliated by hitting his stepfather in the head with a bench, and that's pretty much the end of their relationship -- except the couple also had a daughter, Cheryl, mostly an afterthought in this story. The author's anger lingers, he writes: "bone-hard, comforting like a familiar scar."
"Irma" is told in three parts, and in the second McDonell, who came of age in the era of New Journalism, makes the very New Journalistic choice to swerve into the third person. It's hard to know what to make of this, except that he seems to be squinting anew at the very cosmopolitan successes documented in "An Accidental Life," and perhaps too at his considerable sexual conquests.
He struggles to remember the name of a woman he got pregnant before alighting on "Kathleen." After Kathleen and a hippie who's just joined a commune comes Nadine, an Air France stewardess from Nantes. Then it's to New York, where he writes approvingly of feminist demonstrators "pinching his ass" on Fifth Avenue.
After dabbling in art, McDonell had set out to "make literature in a manly way" and came to be known for his fraternity of very male writers (Thomas McGuane, Hunter S. Thompson, James Salter). Here he affirms his allyship with the sisterhood, maybe a little too strenuously. "He never leered" like Norm, he reassures us. He befriended Kay Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post, and noted Irma's resemblance to Gloria Steinem.
Unscathed by #MeToo, he nonetheless seems to be now experiencing mild #MeRue: about a drunken escapade with a curator and a drugged one with a visitor in a cotton dress from San Francisco who laughs when nearby church bells toll as he is mid-climax. "He thought he might write about those bells someday but was not at all sure what he would write," McDonell writes of McDonell. "It had to be about more than just him and his penis, and good luck with that, anyway."
His clearer "reckoning" is with Hemingway, whose crisp sentences are clearly a stylistic influence, but whose pastimes -- especially the lion-killing -- and parenting methods prove troubling. "I believe Ernest got it all wrong," he writes, of fatherhood, and "the thing about Ernest, there are too many things you do not want to know." Homer fares better, and Irma is his true North.
"The Accidental Life" was a tough-guy book, littered with name droppings. What we have here is McDonell's soft underbelly -- therapist visits, journaling with colored pens, worrying about Alzheimer's disease -- and I am loath to poke it too much. Call your mother.

Ohio Races to Retool for Electric Car Revolution: [National Desk]

Full text: Erick Belmer has seen how tough the car business can be. He was working at a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, when it shut down in 2019, devastating the community.
Mr. Belmer, an industrial mechanic, got another job at a G.M. transmission factory in Toledo, but his commute is now 140 miles each way. His schedule gives him just a few hours with his family and a few hours of sleep.
Yet far from being bitter, Mr. Belmer says he is excited. G.M. is converting his factory to produce electric motors, part of an industrial transformation that will redefine manufacturing regions and jobs around the world.
G.M., Ford Motor and other carmakers announced investments of more than $ 50 billion in new factories in the United States last year, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. All but a small fraction of that money was to build and retool plants for electric vehicles and batteries.
Mr. Belmer is one of thousands of people who will also have to pick up new skills. "It's going to be a little bit of a learning curve," he said at the Toledo factory. "But our guys are well equipped to handle this."
Mr. Belmer and Ohio are bellwethers of how the transition to electric vehicles will play out. G.M., Jeep, Honda Motor and parts makers employ many thousands of people across this state.
Ohio produces more internal combustion engines than any other state, making an adjustment to electric cars particularly urgent. Nearly 90,000 people work in Ohio for carmakers or parts suppliers, and several times that many are employed by businesses that serve those autoworkers and their families.
The changes are putting Ohio at the forefront of a new technology that is critical to fighting climate change. But some jobs will become obsolete, and some companies will go bankrupt. It's an open question whether the winners will outnumber the losers.
"This is the largest transition in our industry since its inception," said Tony Totty, the president of a United Auto Workers local that represents G.M. workers in Toledo.
Mr. Totty is optimistic about the members of his local. But he is worried about other colleagues whose jobs are tied to gasoline engines, he said.
There is "an expiration date on those facilities and those communities," Mr. Totty said.
Warren, in eastern Ohio, knows what happens when a carmaker leaves town. The city has lost one-third of its population, about 20,000 people, since the 1970s, a process that accelerated after G.M. closed the factory in nearby Lordstown, which produced Chevrolet Cruze sedans, in 2019. Sales of that car had been fading as more Americans chose sport utility vehicles.
Even before that shutdown, auto production jobs had been declining. U.S. automakers and their parts suppliers employed about one million people at the end of 2018, down from more than 1.3 million in 2000. In the years before G.M. closed the Lordstown plant, it had reduced shifts and pared its work force.
"Our biggest export for the last 20 years has been talented young people," said Rick Stockburger, the president of Brite Energy Innovators, an organization in Warren that offers work space, advice and funding to start-ups.
Today, things are looking somewhat better. Ultium Cells, a joint venture of G.M. and LG Energy Solution, is ramping up production of batteries near the defunct factory.
Foxconn, a Taiwanese manufacturer, has taken over the old G.M. plant and plans to produce electric vehicles and tractors there. The complex will also house an "electric vehicle academy" established by Foxconn and Youngstown State University to train workers.
That surge in investment is helping to revive Warren's tidy but sleepy downtown. Doug Franklin, the mayor, who worked for G.M. in Lordstown, said he was pleased recently to step into a local restaurant where "nobody knew me, because we had so many new people."
Mr. Franklin represents the optimistic view -- that an industrial renaissance is underway. The pandemic and the supply chain chaos that it caused have made companies leery of components produced far away. That experience, plus billions in federal subsidies approved by Democrats last year, motivated manufacturers to build vehicles, batteries and other components in the United States.
"We're seeing a new level of hope that I haven't seen in decades," Mr. Franklin said.
But community leaders in Warren are also aware that the transition comes with risks.
Hopes that the old plant will become a buzzing electric vehicle factory have not panned out, so far. G.M. sold the factory to Lordstown Motors, a fledgling electric pickup truck company that ran into trouble and resold the plant to Foxconn.
Executives at Foxconn, which has long assembled electronic devices but has little experience making cars, declined interview requests. It's not clear when the company will mass-produce electric vehicles in Lordstown, if ever.
The Rev. Todd Johnson, the pastor of the Second Baptist Church in Warren and a member of the City Council, worries that his mostly African American parishioners won't benefit from the new jobs.
Mr. Johnson, whose parents worked for G.M., encourages young people to study subjects like robotics and coding, and has led after-church trips to a science and technology center in nearby Youngstown.
"There are going to be opportunities coming," he said, "and I desperately don't want to see the next generation of our children miss out."
One pressing question is what will happen to people whose skills are no longer needed.
G.M. is dealing with that issue at the Toledo factory, Toledo Propulsion Systems, which makes transmissions that electric cars won't need. The automaker has committed to retraining the Toledo workers to make electric motors, and to investing $ 760 million to convert assembly lines at the plant.
If anything, G.M. will need more workers, said Eric Gonzales, the executive director of the factory, as it replaces gasoline models with electric cars. "We're taking the employees with us."
The G.M. factory in Toledo will show whether established automakers can compete with Tesla, the fast-growing automaker that can focus all of its resources on electric vehicles because that's all it makes. Established carmakers need to keep earning money from internal combustion vehicles while ramping up a new technology that is not yet profitable.
G.M. has an advantage, Mr. Gonzales said, because it has factories equipped with sprinkler systems, high-voltage power and other essentials. "We already have the four walls here with the infrastructure," he said, speaking above the din of clanking machinery. "Somebody new, they have very expensive capital costs."
Other auto executives prefer to start fresh. Volkswagen's new Scout Motors unit looked at sites in Ohio and other states to produce electric pickup trucks and S.U.V.s, but chose to build a $ 2 billion factory in South Carolina.
It's cheaper and easier to build from scratch, said Scott Keogh, the chief executive of Scout. "You're not juggling this classic dynamic of a legacy internal combustion engine plant where you need to inject a new electric vehicle," he said.
Ohio is in intense competition with other states to attract investment. But Midwestern states, including Michigan, Indiana and Illinois, have been less successful than states in the South where Republican political leaders have courted investment aggressively -- even as they denounce the Democratic policies that helped create the boom.
Since 2020, automakers have announced investments of $ 51 billion in electric vehicle and battery production in the South, compared with $ 31 billion in states in the Great Lakes region, according to the Center for Automotive Research.
Southern states tend to have lower labor costs, in part because most auto plants there are not unionized. This could pose a problem for the United Auto Workers and President Biden, who want the switch to electric vehicles to create more high-paying union jobs. It could well be that most of the new electric car and battery jobs will end up in the South, where unions face political opposition, and not in the Midwest, where unions have political clout -- and where most of the jobs lost in combustion engine vehicles once were.
Ohio has some things going for it. In March, Honda Motor said it would convert one of two assembly lines at its decades-old plant in Marysville, near Columbus, to build electric vehicles. Honda, a Japanese company, is also building a battery factory about an hour away, in Jeffersonville, with LG Energy Solution.
In Ohio, Honda employs more than 14,000 people making cars and motors, and the company's plans will show whether electric vehicles, which require fewer parts than gasoline cars, will create or destroy jobs.
For the next several years, the transition will probably create jobs as carmakers make both gasoline and electric vehicles. Bob Nelson, the executive vice president of American Honda Motor, noted that, at the moment, there was a shortage of skilled labor. "We're going to need everybody," he said in Marysville, where Honda makes Accord sedans.
What happens later is less certain. "When you don't have the complexity that we're used to, with engines and transmissions and mufflers and radiators and exhaust systems and all those components that aren't going to be there anymore," said Bruce Baumhower, the president of a United Auto Workers local that represents employees of auto suppliers in Ohio, "it makes me wonder what's left."
Dana Incorporated, based in Maumee, near Toledo, is also grappling with that question. Dana's employees -- more than 40,000 of them -- make axles, drive shafts and other parts. Electric vehicles need axles but typically do not need long drive shafts because the motors can be placed close to the wheels.
James Kamsickas, Dana's chief executive, has spent time in China and has been struck by the proliferation of electric vehicles there. Recognizing the threat to some of Dana's products, Mr. Kamsickas acquired several firms with expertise in electric motors and other technology.
Dana now offers axles with electric motors built in, saving weight and energy, and it has deployed its expertise in gaskets to make equipment for cooling electric-car batteries that G.M. plans to use. Most of Dana's orders are for products related to electric vehicles.
Ohio's economic future hinges on whether other companies make similar leaps. "You don't have a choice," Mr. Kamsickas said. "Sooner or later, you'd be a melting iceberg."

TOLEDO, Ohio — Erick Belmer has seen how tough the car business can be. He was working at a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, when it shut down in 2019, devastating the community.
Belmer, an industrial mechanic, got another job at a GM transmission factory in Toledo, Ohio, but his commute is now 140 miles each way. His schedule gives him just a few hours with his family and a few hours of sleep.
Yet far from being bitter, Belmer said he is excited. GM is converting his factory to produce electric motors, part of an industrial transformation that will redefine manufacturing regions and jobs around the world.
GM, Ford Motor and other carmakers announced investments of more than $50 billion in new factories in the United States last year, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. All but a small fraction of that money was to build and retool plants for electric vehicles and batteries.
Belmer is one of thousands of people who will also have to pick up new skills. “It’s going to be a little bit of a learning curve,” Belmer said at the Toledo factory. “But our guys are well equipped to handle this.”
Belmer and Ohio are bellwethers of how the transition to electric vehicles will play out. GM, Jeep, Honda Motor and parts makers employ many thousands of people across this state.
Ohio produces more internal combustion engines than any other state, making an adjustment to electric cars particularly urgent. Nearly 90,000 people work in Ohio for carmakers or parts suppliers, and several times that many are employed by businesses that serve those autoworkers and their families.
The changes are putting Ohio at the forefront of a new technology that is critical to fighting climate change. But some jobs will become obsolete, and some companies will go bankrupt. It’s an open question whether the winners will outnumber the losers.
“This is the largest transition in our industry since its inception,” said Tony Totty, the president of a United Auto Workers local that represents GM workers in Toledo.
Totty is optimistic about the members of his local. But he is worried about other colleagues whose jobs are tied to gasoline engines, he said.
There is “an expiration date on those facilities and those communities,” Totty said.
Warren, in eastern Ohio, knows what happens when a carmaker leaves town. The city lost one-third of its population, about 20,000 people, since the 1970s, a process that accelerated after GM closed the factory in nearby Lordstown, in 2019, that produced Chevrolet Cruze sedans. Sales of that car had been fading as more Americans chose SUVs.
Even before that shutdown, auto production jobs had been declining. U.S. automakers and their parts suppliers employed about 1 million people at the end of 2018, down from more than 1.3 million in 2000. In the years before GM closed the Lordstown plant, it had reduced shifts and pared its workforce.
“Our biggest export for the last 20 years has been talented young people,” said Rick Stockburger, the president of Brite Energy Innovators, an organization in Warren that offers work space, advice and funding to startups.
Today, things are looking somewhat better. Ultium Cells, a joint venture of GM and LG Energy Solution, is ramping up production of batteries near the defunct factory.
Foxconn, a Taiwanese manufacturer, has taken over the old GM plant and plans to produce electric vehicles and tractors there. The complex will also house an “electric vehicle academy” established by Foxconn and Youngstown State University to train workers.
That surge in investment is helping to revive Warren’s tidy but sleepy downtown. Doug Franklin, the mayor, who worked for GM in Lordstown, said he was pleased recently to step into a local restaurant where “nobody knew me, because we had so many new people.”
Franklin represents the optimistic view: that an industrial renaissance is underway. The pandemic and the supply chain chaos it caused have made companies leery of components produced far away. That experience, plus billions in federal subsidies approved by Democrats last year, motivated manufacturers to build vehicles, batteries and other components in the United States.
“We're seeing a new level of hope that I haven’t seen in decades,” Franklin said.
But community leaders in Warren are also aware the transition comes with risks.
Hopes that the old plant will become a buzzing electric vehicle factory have not panned out so far. GM sold the factory to Lordstown Motors, a fledgling electric pickup truck company that ran into trouble and resold the plant to Foxconn.
Executives at Foxconn, which has long assembled electronic devices but has little experience making cars, declined interview requests. It’s not clear when the company will mass-produce electric vehicles in Lordstown, if ever.
The Rev. Todd Johnson, the pastor of the Second Baptist Church in Warren and a member of the City Council, worries that his mostly African American parishioners won’t benefit from the new jobs.
Johnson, whose parents worked for GM, encourages young people to study subjects like robotics and coding and has led after-church trips to a science and technology center in nearby Youngstown. “ There are going to be opportunities coming,” he said, “and I desperately don’t want to see the next generation of our children miss out.”
One pressing question is what will happen to people whose skills are no longer needed.
GM is dealing with that issue at the Toledo factory, Toledo Propulsion Systems, which makes transmissions that electric cars won’t need.
The automaker has committed to retraining the Toledo workers to make electric motors, and to investing $760 million to convert assembly lines at the plant.
If anything, GM will need more workers, said Eric Gonzales, the executive director of the factory, as it replaces gasoline models with electric cars. “We’re taking the employees with us.”
The GM factory in Toledo will show whether established automakers can compete with Tesla, the fast-growing automaker that can focus all of its resources on electric vehicles because that’s all it makes. Established carmakers need to keep earning money from internal combustion vehicles while ramping up a new technology that is not yet profitable.
GM has an advantage, Gonzales said, because it has factories equipped with sprinkler systems, high-voltage power and other essentials. “We already have the four walls here with the infrastructure,” he said, speaking above the din of clanking machinery. “Somebody new, they have very expensive capital costs.”

Dana now offers axles with electric motors built in, saving weight and energy, and it has deployed its expertise in gaskets to make equipment for cooling electric car batteries that GM plans to use. Most of Dana’s orders are for products related to electric vehicles.
Ohio’s economic future hinges on whether other companies make similar leaps. “You don’t have a choice,” Kamsickas said. “Sooner or later, you’d be a melting iceberg.”

WASHINGTON -- The president of the United States spent four minutes on Tuesday talking to the American public about the possibilities and dangers of artificial intelligence. No, not that president. The one who actually occupies the Oval Office.
Americans could be forgiven if they momentarily forgot the most powerful person in the country. As helicopters and cameras followed every step of the Donald J. Trump legal drama in New York more than 200 miles to the north with white Ford Bronco-level intensity, President Biden faded into the background, ceding the stage to his defendant-predecessor.
He seemed content to do so, at least for now. The White House made no effort to compete for attention with the arrest of a former president. Mr. Biden's only appearance came during a meeting with his science advisers. Reporters were escorted in at 2:59 p.m., a hoarse Mr. Biden, fighting a cold, said a few words and the reporters were ushered out again at 3:03 p.m. Ten minutes later, the White House announced Mr. Biden was finished with public events for the day.
The tale of two presidents on this spring afternoon, one quietly focused on technology policy, the other having his fingerprints taken, underscored the unique challenge that has confronted Mr. Biden since taking office more than two years ago. No commander in chief in more than a century has been eclipsed in the public eye by the leader he succeeded the way Mr. Biden has at times. Now with the first criminal prosecution of a former president in American history, it will be that much harder to command the national conversation.
Yet it is a contrast that Mr. Biden's team hopes will eventually benefit him. To the extent that the remainder of Mr. Biden's term is a split screen between the 45th and 46th presidents, White House officials are willing to live with less airtime if it means their president is seen focusing on manufacturing, health care and climate change while the other one is seen focusing on pretrial motions, hostile witnesses and records of hush money paid to a porn star.
"Twenty twenty-three is going to be about Trump -- his legal troubles are going to be a defining story," said Jennifer Palmieri, who was White House communications director for President Barack Obama and a senior campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton. "What does the White House do about that? On some level, that's fine. These stories will peak, and then they'll go away. What Biden has to be is the anti-chaos president."
The wild gyrations of the Trump show, in this view, only reinforce the reasons voters turned to Mr. Biden in the first place -- the appeal of a steady hand against the storm.
"All of this could contribute to lack of faith in institutions, a sense of chaos, disorder, and so the Biden team has to work extra hard at showing that government can work," Ms. Palmieri said.
Still, anti-chaos may be appealing to voters exhausted by Trumpian turmoil, but it has not historically been a big ratings draw. "I assume Biden's team will say the split-screen contrast works in their favor," said Kevin Madden, a longtime Republican strategist. "The problem, though, is with Trump there could be days or weeks like this one where they never get their half of the screen."
No other president would want the kind of publicity that Mr. Trump is getting now, of course, but the fixation on the former president will extend beyond even this historic prosecution. Fani T. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney in Georgia, may decide soon whether to charge Mr. Trump in trying to interfere in the 2020 election, while Jack Smith, a federal special counsel, could seek indictments tied to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and the former president's refusal to turn over classified documents.
As if those were not enough to keep the spotlight focused squarely on Mar-a-Lago rather than the White House, Mr. Trump is already scheduled to go on trial on April 25 in a civil lawsuit brought by E. Jean Carroll, a writer who has accused him of raping her. And a civil trial on allegations of financial fraud brought by Letitia James, the New York attorney general, is scheduled to follow on Oct. 2.
Against all that, a meeting of the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology may not seem as compelling to cable television producers or for that matter their audiences. When Mr. Biden flew to Minnesota on Monday to promote a factory making hydrogen electrolyzers, the news channels showed Mr. Trump's private plane, the so-called "Trump Force One," taking off for New York.
"I'm flipping stations and shaking my head," Michael Steele, a former Republican National Committee chairman who broke with Mr. Trump, wrote on Twitter. "It's no wonder we can't recover from this Trump infection because the media continues to feed Trump's thirst to be everything everywhere all at once! On the plane, off the plane, in the car. Y'all know the actual @POTUS travelled today?"
The White House was left to make the best of the situation. Jeffrey D. Zients, the new chief of staff, posted an image of the front page of The Star Tribune of Minneapolis featuring the headline "Biden touts investment in Minn."
Ben LaBolt, the White House communications director, expressed no concern about the ability to connect with the public. "We think being responsive to the concerns of hard-working Americans resonates and is what they expect of a president," he said.
The nonstop motorcade-to-courthouse-to-plane-to-Florida-to-estate coverage of Mr. Trump's arraignment and travels on Tuesday brought to mind the O.J. Simpson case for many old enough to remember the obsessive interest in the celebrity murder case. There came a moment during that saga when even President Bill Clinton was forced to share a television screen on one of his biggest nights, as he delivered his State of the Union address in 1997 at the same time a jury was handing down its verdict in the civil trial.
But that was a one-off situation. With rare exceptions, Mr. Clinton and other presidents in the modern age have enjoyed unrivaled control of the bully pulpit. For the most part, their predecessors made a point of staying out of sight. Even former presidents who outspokenly criticized their successors, like Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter, hardly came close to dominating the news the way Mr. Trump does.
The closest parallel to Mr. Biden's situation may be that of William Howard Taft, who could hardly compete for attention with his larger-than-life predecessor, Theodore Roosevelt, who ultimately mounted an unsuccessful comeback campaign against his onetime ally in 1912. That, of course, was long before the era of social media and cable television.
"It is a challenge for governing," said Julian E. Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton. "Part of what presidents do is shift the agenda to issues they want Congress and the public to focus on. That's hard with Trump in the picture. The advantage is it creates space for low-level policymaking outside the radar on issues that might otherwise create public controversy."
Indeed, Mr. Biden's brief public appearance on Tuesday did not mean he was not working behind the scenes. He placed calls to President Emmanuel Macron of France and King Charles III of Britain. On his Twitter feed, he (or his tweet writers) maintained a steady patter of earnest posts, promoting his budget, congratulating college basketball tournament winners and wishing those who celebrate a happy Mahavir Jayanti marking the birth of Lord Mahavira, who created the defining rules of Jainism, an Indian religion.
Mr. Biden left it to his press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, to deflect the obvious questions about Mr. Trump. During her daily briefing, she talked about Finland's ascension into NATO, Russia's arrest of an American journalist and the president's meeting with tech advisers. But the first arrest of a former president and "anything that is touching or relating to the case," she declared, was off limits.
Not that reporters in the White House briefing room neglected to press her. They asked about security concerns in New York and the rule of law. They inquired whether the president watched the televised proceedings and if he would consider pardoning Mr. Trump, even though a president's pardon power does not extend to state cases like the one in New York.
When one reporter noted that there is "great shock in Japan about the arrest of the opposition candidate," Ms. Jean-Pierre appeared confused for a moment, until she realized that it was just one more effort to get her to discuss Mr. Trump.
"I love how you guys are asking me this in different ways," she said. She then repeated what she had said again and again: "I'm just not going to comment from here" before calling an end to the day's briefing.
By the evening, her briefing got 12,000 views on the White House's YouTube channel and the president's brief science remarks 2,100. Within hours, Mr. Trump made a prime-time statement on his arrest that millions were expected to watch.

In Crowds Outside Court, Anger and Oddity Collide: [National Desk]

Full text: Across from the Lower Manhattan courthouse, lawmakers waded in amid opposing crowds raging over the former president's fate.
A block-sized park, darkened in morning shadow by the courthouse across Centre Street, erupted in a chaos of jeers, flags, whistles and the clanging of spoons against metal pots as protesters converged to defend or bash Tuesday's famous defendant.
Hours before the arrival of Donald J. Trump at the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building, hundreds of people gathered in groups or stood alone beneath leafless trees, spreading banners or holding handmade signs on cardboard. The opposing groups were divided by police barricades. Intruders who infiltrated their opponents' turf were quickly surrounded and shouted down or shoved.
Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a far-right Georgia Republican closely aligned with Mr. Trump, had promoted the rally at Collect Pond Park in the days before the arraignment that made him the first ex-president to face criminal charges.
Ms. Greene arrived and spoke through a megaphone, her words drowned out by protesters from both camps. After about five minutes, she was ushered out of the park by the police as protesters banged on the windows of the Ford Expedition in which she rode.
Representative George Santos, a Republican of Long Island, also visited the park, but he too left soon after, trailed by shouts from protesters about a history of lies that was uncovered only after he was elected to his first term. Asked if he planned to travel to Mr. Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, to support him later Tuesday, he said, "Guys, I don't have a plane."
Collect Pond Park, named for a long-ago reservoir, was part of the once notorious Five Points tenement slum and, in more recent years, was overrun by rats. On Tuesday, its 0.99 acres became the stage for outrage and spectacle, filling with shouts:
"Four more years!"
"U.S.A.!"
"We love Trump!"
One young man was dressed like the courthouse-bound former president. Another came disguised as Abraham Lincoln.
A woman from Ireland who lives in Queens, calling herself Marie Free -- a fake last name to keep harassers away, she said -- displayed a picture of Mr. Trump and, curiously, another of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
She said she thought the slain civil rights leader and the former president would have gotten along: "They really would have so much in common. They both love this country."
With reporters and cameras thronging the park, many protesters seized on the chance to promote causes that had nothing to do with Mr. Trump's arrest. A man walked past shouting an anti-trans slogan, and the woman with the picture of Dr. King joined him, yelling together: "two genders!"
Ozzie Hernandez, 58, of the Lower East Side, planted himself deep in opposing territory with a sign that read "Trump Felony" and shouted in support of Mr. Trump's arrest. He was immediately flanked or surrounded by police officers -- eight of them at one point -- as pro-Trump protesters jeered him.
"They're worried I'm going to provoke something," Mr. Hernandez said. He reassured the officers: "They can call me whatever they want. I'm not here to hurt people -- I'm New York, born and raised."
He paused to allow a video journalist to clip a microphone to his shirt for an interview. A man in a rubber Trump mask and an orange prison jumpsuit walked past, stopping at a fence to grab the bars like a prison cell. Countless hands clutching smartphones were raised in his direction. He held the pose.
In contrast, pro-Trump protesters who ventured into the opposing camp appeared to face elevated harassment.
A contributor for the far-right network Newsmax and a cameraman entered the anti-Trump section and tried to interview people. They met a wall of protesters, who steadily pushed them back. One person pushed the reporters with a black umbrella.
The cameraman turned his rig off and warned the correspondent, Cara Castronuova, to be careful. "Just capture the story!" she replied. "Turn your camera on. Let's do this!"
A police officer shouted "Get out of here! It's not safe." The reporters left.
A man wrapped in an American flag ventured into the anti-Trump ranks and was confronted by young men, their faces covered in black balaclavas. When they ordered him to leave, a bystander, Russ Meyer, 47, of Manhattan, tried to intervene.
"I'm not pro-Trump at all -- I'm a Libertarian," Mr. Meyer explained. "It's a public park. You can't threaten people."
At times, the park seemed to be half protesters, half journalists or video bloggers, arriving from seemingly all over the world with camera crews or phones in tow. Several walked alone, narrating to their screens.
By midday, the shadow of the courthouse was gone, and the spring sunshine -- the temperatures rose toward 70 degrees -- threatened to turn the mostly white faces shades of pink. A woman passed out fliers promoting a claim that Mr. Trump, in a past life, was George Washington, making him both the nation's first and 45th president.
Richard Fisher brought a sign with battery-powered lights that read "LOCK HIM UP," and said he was pleased by the upbeat mood of those around him.
"Trump wanted to stir up all this anger and violence," said Mr. Fisher, 66, of Columbus Circle in Manhattan. "And as you can see, it's not working."
When Mr. Trump's motorcade arrived at the district attorney's office shortly before 1:30 p.m. few at the park seemed to notice -- the very object of all the defending or derision slipping past unseen. Many people read about his arrival after the fact, on their phones.
Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of filing false business records and left the courthouse as he arrived, unobserved.
In the park, as the afternoon wore on, the police presence appeared to shrink, which worried Kate Irwin, 47, a self described "stage manager of the resistance" on the anti-Trump side.
"We need to watch out," she said. "Right now is when it starts getting a little weird."

WASHINGTON — The president of the United States spent four minutes on Tuesday talking to the American public about the possibilities and dangers of artificial intelligence. No, not that president. The one who actually occupies the Oval Office.

A Masquerade That Turned Out to Be Something Real: [Society Desk]

Full text: Dr. Amit Raj's cousins kept nudging him to ask Dr. Ami Modi out. So he got her on board to pretend they were dating. Soon enough, they really were.
Dr. Amit Raj got so tired of his two cousins constantly pestering him about going out with their friend Dr. Ami Deepak Modi that during the summer of 2010 he decided to play a joke on them.
"Actually, we are dating," Dr. Raj, now 34, told them the next time they brought it up, just before his senior year at DePaul University in Chicago, from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree in biology. "They were shocked."
To top it off, he got Dr. Modi, now 31, in cahoots.
"We need to mess with my cousins," Dr. Raj texted her via his beloved, dinosaur of a flip phone.
He slyly got her number from one of his well-meaning cousins, who also happened to be her best friend from Glenbard North High School in Carol Stream, Ill.; she knew his other cousin from St. Louis University, where she was about to start her sophomore year, and from which she graduated with a biology degree.
Dr. Raj, whose parents are from Hyderabad, India, grew up in Marion, Ind., and has two sisters. He is now a podiatric surgeon at NorthShore University HealthSystem in Evanston, Ill., and received a master's degree in biology from Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, and a doctor of podiatric medicine degree from Doctor William M. Scholl College of Podiatric Medicine, in North Chicago.
"The news spread in his family like wildfire," said Dr. Modi, who came to this country from Mumbai when she was 7 with her parents and older sister.
She is now a pulmonary and critical care fellow at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, and received a medical degree from Kansas City University in Missouri.
"I was falling for him," she said, as they G-chatted and texted daily during their six-month charade. "He was really funny and charming."
Not only were they both pre-med, but were also big into tennis. She was No. 1 in high school singles; he was the state runner-up in doubles while at boarding school in Michigan. They also couldn't get enough of Bollywood and Hollywood films, and were fans of "Air Force One," the 1997 movie starring Harrison Ford.
"What are the chances?" Dr. Modi said.
In December 2010, they went ice-skating with friends in Chicago, and then met up again with friends in February at an Indian folk dance competition at Indiana University Bloomington.
"I did have butterflies that weekend," said Dr. Raj, who slow danced with her at an after-party.
In March, their joke turned out to be on them -- they had their real first date, giggling and holding hands, at the Body Worlds exhibit featuring human anatomy at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.
The official game changer, though, occurred a month later when he drove down to St. Louis for her Indian Student Association formal, to which she wore a teal-colored sari, and got him a silk tie to match.
"Will you be my girlfriend?" he asked the day before by a fountain in Forest Park on their way to dinner at an Italian restaurant.

"I already am," she said, to which he quickly replied, "It's not official till I ask."
That summer they hung out in Chicago, where she gave him moral support as he decided whether to delay medical school for his dream -- TV and film screenwriting and development in Hollywood.
He opted for a yearlong internship at Warner Bros., starting in December, which included working on the TV sitcom "The Big Bang Theory." When she visited him they camped out under the stars in Big Sur.
"That is our favorite place in the world," said Dr. Raj, who eventually headed to podiatry school.
In 2017, after years of long distance, they finally both had residencies in Chicago, and moved in together.
When Covid hit, and podiatric surgery was at a standstill, Dr. Raj cooked, and used his cinematic know-how to welcome her home after long hours in the I.C.U.
"He had grown a mustache and re-enacted 'Tiger King,' or pretended to be a D.J. at a disco club," she said with a laugh.
On Sept. 2, 2021, after he created a fake anniversary party invitation to get them to California, he got down on one knee as she stood in heels on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean at sunset in Big Sur.
Always the jokester, he gave Dr. Modi, who is taking his name, a choice of a blueberry pop ring or diamond ring.
Of their five wedding celebrations over four days, they agreed the highlight was Jeffrey Iqbal, the Bollywood fusion singer, along with his band, playing at their sangeet, the evening before the wedding ceremony.
On March 18, Pandit P. Krishna Jois, a Hindu priest, officiated, before 330 guests, in the greenhouse at Gaylord Palms Resort & Convention Center in Kissimmee, Fla.
"We're excited to spend the rest of our lives together," said Dr. Raj, quite seriously. "It started out as a joke, but marriage is not a joke, right?"

A Failed Indictment Is Better Than None: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant was arrested by a police officer for speeding in his horse-drawn coach in Washington. The officer stuck out his hand to signal a stop, and Grant obeyed and then accompanied the officer to the police station.
Did that demean the presidency?
No, I'd say it was a beautiful tribute to democracy. What was unthinkable for the French Sun King, Louis XIV --"L'état, c'est moi" ("I am the state") -- is appropriate in a system of equality before the law.
The Times reports that a grand jury has voted to indict Donald Trump for hush-money payments to a porn star but that the indictment, for now, is under seal. There are legitimate questions about this particular prosecution, and while we don't know details of the charges, after educated guesses, we wonder:
Should the first indictment of an ex-president be under a novel legal theory that could be rejected by a judge or a jury? What do we make of the doubts about this case even among those who have zero sympathy for Trump? Does District Attorney Alvin Bragg know what he's doing?
None of us can be sure of the answer to these questions until we've seen the evidence presented at trial, and I worry that a failed prosecution might strengthen Trump. Yet I'd also worry -- even more -- about the message of impunity that would be sent if prosecutors averted their eyes because the suspect was a former president.
The former president's fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for doing Trump's bidding, and a fundamental principle of justice is that if an agent is punished, then the principal should be as well. That is not always feasible, and it may be difficult to replicate what a federal prosecution achieved in Cohen's case. But the aim should be justice, and this indictment honors that aim.
That's particularly true because this is clearly a higher-stakes crime than a typical case of falsifying business records; the aim apparently was to affect the outcome of a presidential election, and that may have happened.
When Trump is arrested, he reportedly will be fingerprinted, photographed and possibly handcuffed. The question arises: Is it degrading for a democracy to prosecute a former leader?
The democracy that is most expert at arresting former leaders is South Korea, which has gone after five former presidents and which I have covered on and off since I was the Times bureau chief in Hong Kong in the 1980s.
One former president was sentenced to death in 1996 for his role in a massacre during the military dictatorship. His successor was sentenced to 17 years in prison for similar offenses.
Another former president killed himself in 2009 while under investigation in a corruption scandal. That president's successor was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison for corruption. And the next president, in office from 2013 to 2017, was sentenced to a total of 25 years in prison for crimes including bribery and abuse of power.
There were times when I thought this parade of prosecutions was a sign of political immaturity. Yet maybe I got it backward. Yes, South Korea in the 1990s was an immature democracy with a penchant for corruption -- but those prosecutions helped make South Korean democracy more robust.
"It is not easy for Koreans to prosecute our former presidents," Jie-ae Sohn, a communications professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, told me. "It is a painful process and one that we are not happy to show the rest of the world. Nevertheless, this process has made it crystal clear that the rule of law applies to everyone."
Sohn added, "This process may be ugly, but we believe this strengthens our democracy and allows it to be more resilient."
There is a counterargument that this is America's moment for prosecutorial discretion to allow the country to recover and move on. As a teenager, I was outraged when President Gerald Ford pre-emptively pardoned former President Richard Nixon, yet over time I came to think that it was the right call and allowed the country to heal. Yet one difference is obvious: Nixon in 1974 was already completely discredited, ostracized and broken, while Trump denies any wrongdoing and is running again for the White House.
South Korea perhaps offers a model for promoting both the rule of law and healing. While former presidents there received tough sentences, they were all pardoned and released within one to four years.
It's difficult at this stage for me to assess the strength of the Manhattan district attorney's indictment against Trump, but I find inspiration in the words of William H. West, the police officer who arrested Grant for speeding. According to an account he gave many years later, reported in The Washington Post, he told Grant, "I am very sorry, Mr. President, to have to do it, for you are the chief of the nation, and I am nothing but a policeman, but duty is duty, sir, and I will have to place you under arrest."
That's the majesty and dignity of our legal system at its best. And if a police officer in 1872 could hold out his hand and force the president's speeding carriage to a stop, then we, too, should do what we can to uphold the magnificent principle of equality before the law.

Randall Robinson, Catalyst in Fight Against Apartheid, Dies at 81: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He also supported reparations for descendants of enslaved Americans and sanctuary for Haitian refugees. But he lived for two decades in self-imposed exile.
Randall Robinson, a self-described "pained victim of stolen identity" raised in segregated Virginia who grew up to galvanize Americans against apartheid in South Africa and champion reparations for the descendants of slaves, died on Friday in Basseterre, on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts, where he had lived in self-imposed exile from the United States for more than two decades. He was 81.
His wife, Hazel Ross-Robinson, said he died in a hospital from aspiration pneumonia.
Born into poverty in a rat-infested home without central heating, a telephone or a television set, Mr. Robinson was raised by loving parents, both teachers. He went on to win a basketball scholarship to college and to graduate from Harvard Law School. In 1978, his older brother, Max Robinson, became the first Black person to co-anchor the news on a national network, on "ABC World News Tonight."
Mr. Robinson's accomplishments were considerable -- through sit-ins, hunger strikes and other protests as the president of the lobbying and research organization TransAfrica, as a founder of the Free South Africa Movement and on behalf of Haitian refugees. In 1984, Representative Don Edwards, a California Democrat, called him "the most effective foreign policy catalyst in recent history."
But the frustration and resentment he felt over what he viewed as only a grudging acquiescence of the American government and white society to Black civil rights and equal opportunity drove him to quit as head of TransAfrica and emigrate in 2001.
"What have I done with my pain?" he asked in his book "Defending the Spirit: A Black Life in America," which was published in 1998, shortly before he and his wife moved to St. Kitts.
"I am not eager to know," he wrote. "I can find no answer of which I can be proud. White-hot hatred would seem the proper reflex. But there is no survival there. In the autumn of my life, I am left regarding white people, before knowing them individually, with irreducible mistrust and dull dislike."
Unlike his successful campaign for economic sanctions and corporate disinvestment in South Africa, or his 27-day hunger strike that pressured the Clinton administration to open the gates to some Haitian refugees, Mr. Robinson's campaign for widespread reparations on the basis of lineage to the progeny of enslaved African Americans, and his embittered expatriation, generated a backlash.
Reviewing Mr. Robinson's book "Quitting America: The Departure of a Black Man From His Native Land" in The Washington Post, the Black author Jake Lamar concluded that "above all, 'Quitting America' is a love story; more specifically, a wrenching tale of unrequited love." But, Mr. Lamar added: "Surely America must offer a great many Black citizens -- who have had the opportunity to leave -- something that they have not found elsewhere."
Randall Maurice Robinson was born on July 6, 1941, in Richmond, Va., to Maxie and Doris (Jones) Robinson. Growing up in the segregated South shaped him from the beginning.
"The insult of segregation was searing and unforgettable," he told The Progressive magazine in 2005. "I decided a long time ago to join the social justice movement. It was salvaging.
"We all have to die," he continued, "and I preferred to have just one death. It seems to me that to suffer insult without response is to die many deaths."
Mr. Robinson, who was 6-foot-5, won a basketball scholarship to Norfolk State College (now University) in Virginia in 1959, but he left during his junior year and was drafted into the Army. He later attended Virginia Union University, graduating with a bachelor's degree in sociology in 1967, and Harvard Law School, from which he received a degree in 1970.
He practiced civil rights law in Boston, won a Ford Foundation fellowship to work in Tanzania, and from 1972 to 1975 directed the community development division of the Roxbury Multi-Service Center in Boston. He then moved to Washington to become administrative assistant to Representative Bill Clay, a Missouri Democrat.
Mr. Robinson founded TransAfrica in 1977 with the goal of influencing U.S. foreign policy concerning African and Caribbean countries. He and other Black leaders were arrested during a sit-in in 1984 at the South African Embassy in Washington and later formed the Free South Africa Movement.
He was a supporter of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the former Salesian priest who became Haiti's first democratically elected president but who was overthrown in a coup that sent boatloads of Haitian refugees to the United States beginning in 1991. Mr. Robinson sought to relax the policy of repatriating the refugees to Haiti, where many faced reprisals as Aristide supporters. Mr. Aristide was later reinstated, but in 2004 he was ousted in another coup, said to have been engineered by France and the United States.
Among Mr. Robinson's other books were "The Debt: What America Owes to Blacks" (2000). Although he continued to live in St. Kitts, he began teaching at the Dickinson School of Law at Pennsylvania State University in 2008.
In addition to Ms. Ross-Robinson, he is survived by a daughter from their marriage, Khalea Ross Robinson; two children from a previous marriage, which ended in divorce, Anike Robinson and Jabari Robinson; and two sisters, Jewell Robinson Sheppard and the Rev. Dr. Jean Robinson-Casey.
Mr. Robinson was instrumental in pressuring the white South African government to end its official policy of racial segregation. His record on some other policy initiatives, however, was mixed.
"No matter what the outcome, it's worth it always to try," he told The New York Times in 1984. "It's better when you're successful, but it's always worth it to try."
At home, he strove for perfection in his avocation, woodworking, where the process was more flexible but the product, for better or worse, could be definitive.
"In my career work, I can never be sure what the outcome will be, but I have complete control over these projects here," he told The Times. "If you're going to carve, if you want to finish it during your lifetime, you want a router. How does one use it? Very careful. You can't put wood back."

Full text: The internet can't get enough of nepo baby content.
"My parents' biggest rule is, like, I'm not allowed to have any public social media accounts," Romy Mars says in a video she posted to TikTok.
Ms. Mars, 16, the daughter of the filmmaker Sofia Coppola and Thomas Mars, the frontman for the band Phoenix, promptly deleted it. But the video was posted on Tuesday to Twitter, where it garnered more views than the "Last of Us" season finale.
The 49-second video is being hailed, with varying degrees of irony, as a nouveau cinematic masterpiece. Ms. Mars said her goal was to make pasta with vodka sauce but admitted she had to Google the difference between onions and garlic. Before introducing her babysitter's boyfriend and stating that her "parents are never home," she nonchalantly confessed: "I'm grounded because I tried to charter a helicopter from New York to Maryland on my dad's credit card because I wanted to have dinner with my camp friend."
It's unclear if the video is a cutting work of self-satire or an accidental window into the life of a particular kind of jet-setting teen. However, this hoopla may be what Mr. Mars and Ms. Coppola -- a celebrity offspring herself, the daughter of the director Francis Ford Coppola -- were trying to avoid. It is all a good case study in what happens when celebrities allow (or don't allow) their children to post to social media, especially amid the public's hunger for so-called nepo baby content.
We asked Jessica Maddox, an assistant professor of digital media at the University of Alabama, about why there was so much public interest in this particular video and how social media has been handled by other nepo babies, including the spawn of Kim Kardashian and Kellyanne Conway.
How are you seeing celebrities approach their children's use of social media?
There are three different camps. One is the outright ban: Don't get on social media publicly, even if you're old enough to have an account. This is what we saw with Sofia Coppola's daughter. A second camp is the mitigated approach, like the joint TikTok account that Kim Kardashian and North West have. That gives the parent a little bit of oversight and access to the content that the child is posting. And then the third camp is the unchecked accounts, where the child has a social media account of their own and can go rogue. This is what happened when Claudia Conway, the daughter of Kellyanne Conway, posted on TikTok about political views that were drastically different from those of her mother.
Why might a parent, like Kim Kardashian, make a joint account with their child?
Parent-child joint accounts are not very common. For one, North is too young to have a TikTok account, which is why she does it with her mom. But North's TikTok account also seems to keeps people interested in Kim Kardashian because it shows a side of her that we don't always get to see. At the same time, we are also viewing North as, inevitably, a celebrity in her own right. Her whole life will have been mediated either through her parents' reality TV show or through her social media presence. It'll be "Keeping Up With the Kardashian Children on Social Media."
Do you think the outright ban can backfire?
Having been a teenager long before I was a scholar of social media, I think that any time your parent tells you not to do something, you immediately want to do it. Even when you try to do an outright ban, their friends are going to have social media. I tell all my students: We can't be afraid of social media. It is here. It's not just that we have to learn how to live with it; we can use it in ways that are helpful, beneficial and safe for us.
How do you think celebrities will be approaching their kids' social media accounts five years from now?
I think we're going to see a lot more supervision of the children of celebrities online. These children may wind up with their own social media managers earlier rather than later in an effort to make sure what they're posting isn't harmful to their parents or to themselves.
Why did this video blow up?
We have a celebrity kid who actually hasn't been in the public eye much, which added to the mystery. Even though the ridiculousness of trying to charter a helicopter with your dad's credit card is completely foreign to most of us, I think people resonated with the idea of being a teenager whose parents wouldn't let her leave the house. In the realm of teenage rebellion, this was actually pretty wholesome -- but people will be asking her about vodka sauce for the rest of her life.

When the Spiritual Is Also Political: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Patrisse Cullors and noé olivas trade activism for spiritual reflection in a joint exhibition that emphasizes the Ifá religious tradition.
LOS ANGELES -- At the Charlie James Gallery, in the Chinatown neighborhood here, a surprising exhibition of spiritually reflective and esoteric artwork opened recently. Surprising because the artists, Patrisse Cullors and noé olivas, are known for their activism and social engagement, and because the works in the show, "Freedom Portals," reject the strident, declamatory tenor of much political art.
Cullors and olivas, the exhibition guide notes, are practitioners of Ifá, a Yoruba religion from West Africa. Cullors's artworks, each made from a framed section of black-and-white patterned cloth embroidered with cowrie shells, are titled after Mejis or Odù, sacred Ifá verses used in divination, a central feature of Yoruba religious practice.
Hung high on the walls like church icons, sculptures by olivas consist of garden shears wired onto small puddles of iridescent, dichroic glass. All his pieces are titled as prayers -- "Prayers of Protection" or "Prayers of Support" -- but prayers to what, or to whom? I met with the artists at the gallery to learn more about what Ifá means to them, and how their political vocations are manifesting in new forms.
In recent years, there has been a conspicuous rise in contemporary art that engages with religious or spiritual ideas. But unlike most historical religious art, whose primary purpose was to deepen or focus the beholder's belief, this contemporary work tends toward personal inquiry and private reflection.
Cullors revealed that she was raised a Jehovah's Witness, but later went through phases of atheism and agnosticism. Reading Malidoma Somé's book about Indigenous religions, "The Healing Wisdom of Africa," was transformative. Soon after, on the recommendation of a friend, she sat for a divination with a babalawo, an Ifá high priest.
"It just made sense," she said. "The divination wasn't airy-fairy; the clouds didn't open. As much as I'm spiritual, I'm very pragmatic too. He just gave me very clear advice, clear messages. I said, 'I think I've found my tradition.' That was in 2003. I was initiated in 2008."
Cullors said that Ifá allows her to reconnect with a lost ancestry sundered by the trans-Atlantic slave trade. "Ifá has been a way to reclaim what was stolen from me to begin with."
Olivas, 35, who was raised Roman Catholic, was introduced to Ifá by Cullors and has been practicing for two years. "Prayer is a moment for us to ask for something," he said, "but it's also a moment for us to be present. I'm trying to expand that language of prayer into object-making."
Cullors, 39, is best known as a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, which grew from a hashtag coined in 2013 into a global movement. She served as the executive director of Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation until 2021. The organization has since restructured after it faced challenging questions over its infrastructure and the allocation of funds.
In 2020, Cullors organized a performance at Frieze Los Angeles in which she interrupted the art fair with a joyful, participatory dance event calling for freedom from white supremacy. Last month, she returned to Frieze Los Angeles, this time to mount an unsanctioned protest in memory of her cousin Keenan Anderson, a 31-year-old teacher who died in January after a police officer repeatedly fired a Taser at him during a traffic stop.
Before she was politicized, Cullors was an artist. In 2017 she enrolled in graduate school at the University of Southern California, where she met olivas, a fellow art student.
In 2018, the two collaborated on a performance, first staged at Hauser & Wirth in Los Angeles, part of a program responding to the artist Zoe Leonard's trenchant typewritten diatribe "I want a president" (1992). Cullors and olivas performed ritualistic actions inside a circle of salt, dumped from a wheelbarrow onto the floor. The piece, "It's dangerous times. We have to be connected," was a metaphor for interpersonal and communal support.
The two artists further fostered that community support with the Crenshaw Dairy Mart, an art collective, gallery and event space in South Los Angeles that they founded in 2020 with a fellow U.S.C. alum, alexandre dorriz (who, like olivas, styles his name in lowercase).
At the same time, the artists maintained individual studio practices. In 2022, olivas exhibited a sculptural installation, "Let's Pray," at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles. Featuring terra-cotta casts of truck tires and buckets alongside tools that had belonged to his father, the installation was inspired by the toolshed -- a space, according to the exhibition text, that olivas "sees as a spiritual space of creation and community building."
Those truck tires -- cast from one used on the Olivas family's Ford Ranger truck, which the artist now owns -- reappear at Charlie James Gallery, this time glazed in mottled shades of celestial purple. One sits in the center, repurposed as a planter nurturing a live cactus. That sculpture is titled "Prayers of Longevity." Another, "Prayers of Coolness," leans against the wall, cradling a pool of water.
Olivas said that the water is melted snow from California's recently blanketed mountains. He sees this sculpture as a prayer to cool his Ori -- the zone of Ifá consciousness where thought and emotion combine -- in times of anger. The mountain symbolizes the potential for rising above frustrations and minutiae, for taking in the bigger picture.
His wall-mounted works, he said, "represent Ògún, the Ifá god of iron, metal, war and technology." The shears are all well-tarnished; one pair belonged to his father. "A lot of my work is about the tools that are passed down to us," he explained. The lustrous iridescent glass, made from melted-together shards, evokes the Egbe -- the Ifá spiritual community. "The sharp edges are protecting the Egbe."
Cullors's works are similarly coded -- perhaps even more so. In the Ifá tradition, every one of the 256 sacred Odù can be represented both by combinations of vertical dashes and by arrangements of cowrie shells or palm nuts on the divination tray. Cullors represents the first 12 Odù with cowries -- some cast in polished gold -- stitched onto 1950s "mud cloth" from Mali, bought at a flea market in Pasadena. (Mud cloth is stained using fermented mud, and is revered in Malian tradition.)
A guide offers gallery visitors condensed interpretations of the Mejis, but their deeper significance is largely occluded. "It's kind of like, who knows will know, and who wants to know will ask questions," Cullors said. "This is not a tradition that believes in going out and spreading the good word. It's the opposite. We believe that if you're meant to practice, Ifá will call you in."
I chose to put my own spiritual convictions (or lack of them) aside. As with many ritual objects, both artists' works emanate a mysterious energy, despite their sometimes-prosaic materials and their simple combinations. The history of sacred art -- and, indeed, the history of modernist abstraction -- is rich with examples of secret meaning sequestered in captivating aesthetic phenomena. (Those histories overlap in the work of such artists as Hilma af Klint, the Transcendental Painting Group and Emma Kunz.)
For Cullors, the viewers' interpretations were not primary concern when she was developing this series. "These works come from a place of deep grief for me, of wanting so badly for the world to be different," she said. "I kept thinking, what can I make that will help me? Ifá is the practice that I go to when I'm in my lowest moments, and I made a decision to make it public."
In the past three years, she acknowledges, many others have faced their own struggles, which have led them toward the spiritual. "A lot of people are grasping," she said.
"I feel like an Odù takes care of me," Cullors went on, "but it also takes care of the collective, of the community." In its attention to shared pain, her work remains political.

Comedy
Shane Torres
March 18 at 7 and 10 p.m. at the Sultan Room, 234 Starr Street, Brooklyn; thesultanroom.com.
Shane Torres made his national debut performing stand-up on "Conan" in 2016, but it was his follow-up appearance in 2017 that attracted a lot of notice, thanks to his defense of the restaurant owner and Food Network host Guy Fieri. For nearly the past year, Torres has continued to find the good in subjects that attract public scorn with his fellow comic Kyle Kinane on their podcast, "No Accounting for Taste."
But now it's Torres's turn to get his fair share of praise, and the larger-than-life comedian Bert Kreischer, whose fifth special, "Razzle Dazzle," premiered this week on Netflix, has taken up that task, presenting Torres for the tapings of his first hourlong stand-up special. Tickets are $ 25 and available from dice.fm. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
9m88
March 19 at 8 p.m. at Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn; musichallofwilliamsburg.com.
In her quest for an international breakthrough, the singer 9m88 (pronounced "Jo-m-Baba" because of the Mandarin words for 8 and 9) has developed a border- and genre-hopping approach to pop. Based in Taiwan, 9m88 studied jazz vocal performance at the New School, then dabbled in hip-hop and Japanese city pop on early releases. These influences and more seeped into her latest record, "9m88 Radio," a wide-ranging project that flits from samba to piano balladry and features contributions from the South Korean producer SUMIN, the Brooklyn-based rapper Oddisee and the Chinese Australian artist Rainbow Chan, among others. But 9m88 sounds most at home on breezy soul tracks, which provide an ideal stage for the buttery, fluttery vocals that flaunt her jazz training.
On Sunday, 9m88 will play Music Hall of Williamsburg, her first headlining performance in New York since before the pandemic. Tickets are $ 25 and available from AXS. OLIVIA HORN
The Cookers
Through March 18 at Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan; birdlandjazz.com.
Some jazz histories have framed the end of the 1960s as an arbitrary conclusion, portraying the decade that followed as a fallow period for the genre. Think of the Cookers -- a sturdy collective built around the tenor saxophonist Billy Harper, the trumpeter Eddie Henderson, the pianist George Cables, the bassist Cecil McBee and the drummer Billy Hart, all masterful veterans who thrived during the '70s and beyond -- as an ongoing rejoinder to this specious narrative. The group's muscular, richly orchestrated sound, fueled by the members' deep songbooks and refined by the savvy arrangements of Harper and the trumpeter-bandleader David Weiss, is arresting on record and reliably electrifying in person.
For this run, the alto saxophonist Jaleel Shaw will sub for Donald Harrison, who has been part of the Cookers for 10 of its 15-plus years. Sets are at 7 and 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, and 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Tickets are $ 30 for bar seating and $ 40 for tables; they are available at the Birdland website. HANK SHTEAMER
Kids
'Baobab'
March 18-19 at the New Victory Theater, Manhattan; newvictory.org.
Children sometimes refuse to sleep, which causes difficulties for their parents. But when the sun insists on not going to bed, the crisis becomes more global.
That solar stubbornness sets off the action in Hélène Ducharme's play "Baobab," which ends its run this weekend at the New Victory Theater. Playing Saturday at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. and Sunday at 11 a.m., this production from Théâtre Motus of Canada and SÔ Company of Mali uses multiple kinds of puppetry, not to mention types of percussion, to bring a West African fable to life. As traditional instruments produce lively rhythms, four performers don colorful masks and operate towering constructions to become a crocodile, a python, a crane, a marabou, a dancing witch and a sly monkey.
But most important is Amondo, a small boy in the form of a jointed puppet. Hatched from an egg released by a majestic baobab tree, he alone can find the sun's lost heart and bring forth rain. That quest, however, involves four tasks and, as you might suspect, they're doozies.
Tickets are $ 25. LAUREL GRAEBER
Film
Unspeakable: The Films of Tod Browning
March 17-26 at Film at Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan; filmlinc.org.
The much-parodied "one of us, one of us" scene from 1932's "Freaks" (screening on Friday and March 25) only hints at the full perversity in the films of Tod Browning, who for a time had worked as a circus performer. For sheer strangeness, the winner in this retrospective may be 1936's "The Devil-Doll" (on Friday and March 26), starring Lionel Barrymore as an embittered escaped convict who disguises himself as an old woman and is armed with a scientific breakthrough that lets him miniaturize humans and put them under mind control.
The series also features seven of Browning's collaborations with Lon Chaney, who donned around 10 of his thousand faces just for Browning's films. (There's no sign of their famously lost "London After Midnight," alas.) See Chaney as a ventriloquist thief ("The Unholy Three," on Sunday and March 25); as Alonzo, the Armless ("The Unknown," playing on Sunday and March 24 in the longer version recently shown at MoMA's film preservation festival); and as a magician who loses his love and use of his legs and patiently plots revenge ("West of Zanzibar," on Saturday and Wednesday).

Chemical Bans Pose Challenge To Tech Growth: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Key industries -- including some that the White House is backing through other policies -- are lobbying to water down the first major new rules in a generation on chemicals that pose risks to humans.
WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration is preparing to impose some of the first new rules in a generation to restrict or ban an array of toxic chemicals that are widely used in manufacturing, presenting the White House with tough choices between its economic agenda and public health.
Many of the substances in question are important to industries that President Biden has backed through other policies intended to bolster global competitiveness and national security, such as semiconductors and electric vehicles.
Corporations are framing the decisions about new regulations for an initial group of toxic chemicals as putting at risk the administration's drive to nurture the American economy of the future. Environmental and public health groups are stressing the need to focus on protecting workers and communities from substances known to carry health risks, such as cancer, liver and kidney damage and infertility.
A major lobbying clash is already underway. Chip makers, the burgeoning electric vehicle industry and other companies, including military contractors, are pressuring the administration to water down the new rules, saying the repercussions of a ban or new restrictions could be crippling.
"If the national security batteries do not perform as designed, then missiles don't fire, fighter jets crash, and satellites go dark," Aaron Rice, the director of environmental health and safety at EaglePicher Technologies, a Missouri-based battery manufacturer, wrote in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency objecting to expected restrictions on two chemicals the company uses.
Boeing, Cummins, Ford, General Motors, General Electric and dozens of other companies have intervened with the E.P.A. directly or through trade associations to pre-emptively ask for exemptions.
The corporate lobbying has provoked an equally intense response from public health advocates, who argue that the chemicals in question have caused dozens of deaths or thousands of illnesses, particularly affecting Black and Latino communities near industrial zones in Texas, Louisiana and other states.
The E.P.A., the public health experts argue, can protect public health, combat climate change and promote other new technologies by pushing industry to switch to safer chemicals. The claims of disruption to economic growth, public health advocates say, are just scare tactics.
"There is nothing industry won't say to preserve their right to poison workers and consumers to make a buck," said Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group that has been pushing the E.P.A. to move ahead with the rules.
At issue initially are 10 chemicals that the E.P.A. has identified as among the most toxic threats. The agency has completed evaluations on nine of them, with the first three of these proposed chemical rules already undergoing review at the White House. Four others are expected by the end of the year.
The E.P.A. has hinted where it is headed with the new rules, issuing a series of so-called chemical exposure limits that detail how much workers can safely inhale without an increased risk of cancer, liver disease or other ailments -- extremely complex calculations based on decades of studies examining human and animal exposures to the toxins.
The proposed levels in many cases are many times lower than current workplace standards, which are decades old, generating predictions by chemical industry players of enormous impact on existing operations at manufacturing and processing plants.
Both sides are deluging the White House with their arguments.
The effort at the E.P.A. is being overseen by Michal Ilana Freedhoff, a chemist who spent more than two decades as a staff member in Congress working with Democrats who wanted to strengthen the government's powers to regulate toxic chemicals.
The rail accident last month in East Palestine, Ohio, which released toxic substances made with some of the same chemicals now being examined for safety, has focused additional attention on the threat, Ms. Freedhoff said. But the risks from toxic chemicals are present in areas across the United States on a daily basis, particularly for families who live close to factories that manufacture or use them.
"It is literally a matter of life and death for people all across America," Ms. Freedhoff, the head of the E.P.A.'s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, said in an interview at the agency's headquarters.
The pace of progress on toxic chemical regulation in the United States has been extraordinarily slow, even by the glacial standards of Washington's bureaucracy.
Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act in 1976, giving the E.P.A. the power to regulate toxic chemicals. But by 1991, key parts of the law were invalidated by a federal appeals court ruling after industry manufacturers challenged an effort to ban asbestos, a known carcinogen.
For the next 25 years, the United States effectively had no operative toxic chemical law. It was not until 2016 that Congress expanded the E.P.A.'s powers to fill the federal policy vacuum.
Given the decades of regulatory inaction, officials at the E.P.A. acknowledge that there are thousands of chemicals in the United States that have never been properly evaluated for the risk they present based on the specific ways they are used.
As a starting point, the agency identified 83 of the most toxic threats: chemicals that are "known human carcinogens and have high acute and chronic toxicity." It then narrowed that list in 2016 to 10 of these chemicals as the initial focus of the regulatory process.
But more delays followed. When President Donald J. Trump took office in 2017 -- and hired several chemical industry executives to help oversee the revised law -- the E.P.A. revised the way it defined "risk evaluation," bowing to chemical industry lobbying but generating protests from longtime agency employees and lawsuits from public health advocates.
When Mr. Biden came into office two years ago, the pendulum swung back. The E.P.A. moved to define more broadly how it would consider toxic chemical hazards, calling the restrictions that the Trump administration had imposed evidence of how "political interference sometimes compromised the integrity of our science."
The E.P.A. is now evaluating not just contamination in manufacturing plants but also threats to the public at large, through contaminated air or water or at landfills.
The agency also assumes that workers do not always wear respirators or other protective equipment based on a concern that some employers do not mandate these basic safety measures, a decision that has provoked intense protests from chemical companies and industrial users. Workers are already protected, companies say, or the chemicals are used in closed-loop systems where the workers are not exposed at all -- except if there is an accident.
Ms. Freedhoff said the E.P.A. had an obligation to protect both workers and the public. She said she was still haunted by the deaths of children who drank contaminated drinking water in North Carolina and Massachusetts decades ago.
The chemical implicated in the drinking water contamination, trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, can cause sudden death or kidney cancer if a person is exposed to high levels and other neurological harm even at lower exposures over a long period.
Yet the E.P.A.'s recently completed risk-evaluation studies found that as much as 250 million pounds of TCE are still produced in the United States annually to make refrigerants and remove grease from metal parts. It is also used in carpet cleaners, laundry spot removers and even hoof polish for horses.
Based on the new Biden-era risk evaluation, TCE presents an "unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment" in 52 of the 54 known ways it is used as an industrial and consumer product, the E.P.A. determined. That also includes the way in which it is disposed.
"That is locked into my whole moral compass," Ms. Freedhoff said, referring to TCE, which the E.P.A. toxic chemical program has not regulated in the more than three decades since the government first listed it as a probable carcinogen. "We have to take on TCE. That rule has to be done. It has to be protective."
The agency's risk assessments for seven other chemicals -- 1-bromopropane, carbon tetrachloride, C.I. Pigment Violet 29, cyclic aliphatic bromide cluster, methylene chloride, n-methylpyrrolidone, perchloroethylene -- reached similar conclusions of widespread "unreasonable risks," as did one completed during the Trump administration for asbestos.
The toxic chemical law requires the E.P.A. to move immediately to issue regulations to eliminate unreasonable risks by picking from a range of options such as banning the chemical, prohibiting certain types of uses and requiring special health precautions.
The E.P.A. has imposed air pollution restrictions on some of these same chemicals, but manufacturing plants often have mishaps that result in releases despite the rules. Public health advocates and some state health officials have pressed the E.P.A. to consider the cumulative impact of exposures to different chemicals in certain communities near clusters of manufacturing plants.
"All sources of exposure must be considered," said a letter sent by environmental officials from California, New York, Oregon and Washington State.
The revised law gives the E.P.A. the power to grant exemptions to chemical regulations if a ban or restriction "would significantly disrupt the national economy, national security or critical infrastructure," a process that may simply mean companies have more time to phase in a less toxic replacement.
This language has generated a flood of exemption requests, including from a coalition of companies that manufacture lithium batteries used in cellphones and electric vehicles. The batteries use n-methylpyrrolidone, or NMP, which the E.P.A. concluded increases the risk of miscarriages and male infertility.
"It is critical for E.P.A. to recognize that there is no substitute for NMP in our manufacturing processes," the battery-industry trade association wrote in a letter to the agency before requesting an exemption, arguing that it had ways to safely use the chemical. "The federal government should be taking steps to promote -- not impede -- the growth of our rechargeable battery technology in the United States."
The Semiconductor Industry Association, whose members include Intel, GlobalFoundries, Samsung and most of the other major global chip manufacturers, has sent letters to the E.P.A., challenging its assumption that the way the companies use NMP presents a risk to its employees.
Several other industry players pointed out to the E.P.A. that chemicals it could soon impose limits on are essential to manufacture new air conditioning refrigerants that do not deplete the ozone layer or contribute to climate change.
The American Chemistry Council, the country's largest trade association representing the $ 800 billion-a-year chemical industry, has hosted over 100 virtual and in-person meetings for members of Congress and their staff to try to persuade them to more closely oversee the E.P.A.'s actions. Those events included a reception last month on Capitol Hill for newly elected members of Congress, mostly Republicans.
"They've heard from us, they've heard from other stakeholders that work with the E.P.A.," said Ross Eisenberg, the chief lobbyist for the American Chemistry Council, which spent nearly $ 20 million on lobbying last year, the most in its history.
House Republicans, following these appeals, introduced a bill last month that would require the E.P.A. to more broadly weigh "economic, societal" costs before it could reject the use of a new chemical.
Corporate executives and lobbyists have also pressed White House officials to intervene. Executives from Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance -- whose members make TCE and other chemicals -- predicted at a White House meeting in December that there would be dire economic consequences if the E.P.A. moved ahead with tougher workplace inhalation limits.
Companies have also made clear that they intend to sue to try to block the rules once they are imposed.
"Such levels, if mandated, would eliminate U.S. manufacturing of tires, paper, many plastics and many other important products," said a statement presented on behalf of a trade association and Olin Corporation, a major chemical manufacturer.
The new rules, Ms. Freedhoff conceded, would mean higher costs in some cases. But she said she was also convinced that the United States could make progress on combating climate change and expanding major industries like semiconductor manufacturing while still reducing health threats.
"We have to change the way industry does things in order to protect human beings," she said. "Right now, the human beings are assuming the cost."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "An Archaeology of Silence" opens in San Francisco, after a string of police killings of Black men. Along with powerful art, it offers a respite room to those needing a break.
When Kehinde Wiley's exhibition, "An Archaeology of Silence," opens in the United States on March 18, the most important room some viewers might enter is one with no artwork at all.
The "respite room" at the de Young Museum in San Francisco will be an area where visitors can take a breath and regain their composure after viewing the display of almost billboard-size paintings and huge sculptures of Black men and women in sometimes crumpled positions -- struck down, resting, wounded or dead -- in settings that reference iconic Western paintings of religious and mythological subjects.
Among the 25 pieces is "Reclining Nude in Wooded Setting (Edidiong Ikobah)," a painting of a woman in a white tank top, cutoff jean shorts and white sneakers who lies across grassy terrain, her braids bunched atop her head. One 17.5-foot-tall sculpture, titled the same as the exhibition, depicts a limp, shirtless man in jeans and high-tops, draped over a majestic horse. Another sculpture called "The Virgin Martyr Cecilia (Ndey Buri)," shows a lifeless, contorted woman in a miniskirt and sandals lying across the ground.
The show, which debuted last year at the Venice Biennale, has a particular resonance opening in a nation reeling from the latest in a string of police killings of Black men -- merely one segment of a long national timeline of brutality against Black and brown people.
Wiley made the pieces, an extension of his body of work called "Down," in the months following the 2020 killing of George Floyd while in police custody. At the time, the artist was waiting out the pandemic at his studio in Dakar, Senegal, and said the pieces were meant to reflect not only American brutality but also the effects of colonialism on Africans. Some of his models were Senegalese men and women whose names appear in parentheses in the titles of the pieces.
"I wanted to create an American story that can be appreciated by all parts of the globe," Wiley said on a recent afternoon in his sprawling Williamsburg, Brooklyn, studio, where various works-in-progress were propped against one long wall. "In America, to be honest, there's a different type of relevance."
Aware of that relevance, the de Young -- which, with the Legion of Honor, comprises the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco -- has coordinated a multipronged effort that considers the impact the images could have on viewers. It is an endeavor undertaken by other museums across the country, too, that have posted content warnings or installed early exits for exhibits deemed potentially upsetting.
"The U.S. has a special relationship with systemic violence against Black people," said Abram Jackson, the director of interpretation at the Fine Arts Museums, a permanent position the museum created just last year.
He has sought the input of community groups for many aspects of the exhibition including careful parsing of the text that accompanies the art. With the group's input, for example, text that had read "Black bodies" was changed to "Black people" and "state-sanctioned violence" was changed to "systemic violence." The museum is including workshops on grief with its programming. As part of the staff training, the de Young team met with museum security to offer a preview of the renderings so they are emotionally braced once it opens. The museum will offer free admission to the exhibition on several weekends, helped by a $ 1 million grant from Google.org, the company's philanthropic arm.
At the National Gallery of Art, in Washington, D.C., "content advisories" currently accompany the new Philip Guston exhibition, which includes Klan-style figures and was designed to allow visitors to easily bypass controversial pieces. A lengthy trigger warning appears with the "Howardena Pindell: A New Language" exhibit at Spike Island in Bristol, England, which addresses slavery, violence against Black and Indigenous people and the AIDS pandemic. With instructions titled "Self-Care Practice for Self-Regulation: Body Practice and Self-Soothe," it suggests that viewers "tap the chest area with your fingers to regulate and calm your mind. Take short breaths through the mouth to feel safe."
Museums are taking these kinds of approaches as they try to expand their audience, yet worry how that audience will react, said Tom Eccles, the executive director of Bard College's Center for Curatorial Studies, who calls them a "contemporary response but not a misguided one."
"Today, we have an expanded notion of harm, and no museum wants to be in the business of creating a context of harm," he said. "You're going to get very strong responses from people having experiences that museums are not used to, and how does one accommodate that audience? Museums are literally feeling around in the dark."
The exhibition by Wiley, who is best known for his presidential portrait of Barack Obama for the National Portrait Gallery that toured America for more than a year, embraces a solemn vibe: dark and almost chapel-like with bright lights on individual pieces. Viewers can fill out response cards to write about the exhibit, which also will have multiple exits for anyone who needs a break.
"We didn't want this to be a source of entertainment -- you know, 'Let's go see the Obama painter,"' said Akilah Cadet, the founder of Change Cadet, a diversity and inclusion consulting firm who is part of the group assembled to worked with the de Young. "You will be seeing Black death, and it can bring feelings of emotion for you as a white person wherever you are in your journey -- and as a Black person in mourning or wherever you are in your journey."
Just eight models were used for the more than two dozen pieces, building a sense of familiarity for visitors as they pass through the exhibition. When the pieces were shown at the Venice Biennale, some attendees wept and reached out to touch the hands of the sculptures.
"I walked in, and I was truly breathless," said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, who saw the show in Venice.
There, he bumped into Thomas Campbell, the director of the Fine Arts Museums, and the two hatched a plan to bring the exhibition to America, an elaborate and expensive effort considering the size and weight of the pieces. But it was worth it, Walker said.
"For me, it was the treatment of both the dignity and the beauty in the physical bodies represented in these massive bronzes and these large paintings that are often not the way we see dead Black men in American media," Walker said. "When you think about Tyre Nichols and how we saw the physical destruction of an American -- it was so dehumanizing."
In January, officials in Memphis released footage from police body-worn cameras and surveillance cameras that captured the horrific police beating of Nichols, who died after being hospitalized.
The way Wiley wants the pieces displayed -- a direct spotlight on each with darkness filling the rest of the space -- offers a meditation, of sorts, on the deaths of those like Nichols, said Claudia Schmuckli, the show's curator.
"It forces you in this intimate contemplation of the sculptures," she said. "This piercing light bathes the bodies and the paintings. It gives them this aura of transcendence, of ecstasy that really transcends their value of sleep or death, which are all vulnerable, vulnerable states. The treatment of light allows us to see them overcome that."
The show takes its title from a book by the French philosopher Michel Foucault, who describes the emergence of a discourse about something that is being societally suppressed.
The exhibition, "shines the light literally and metaphorically on the madness that is systemic racism that is often met with silence," Schmuckli said.
Officials at the de Young are acquiring two of the sculptures and said they hope the exhibition travels to other U.S. cities, if space and schedules at other museums allow. But they said the show's American opening at the de Young highlights the Bay Area's role in global movements, which is often overlooked, even though it is home of the Black Panther Party, started in Oakland in the 1960s. One of its members, 17-year-old Bobby Hutton, was killed by police there in 1968.
More than half a century later, Wiley talked about a lingering sense of "irrational anxiety," as when he drives through small towns on his way to his home in upstate New York and is pulled over by police.
"But is it irrational? You know what I mean?" he said. "There's just this anxiety that surrounds just being in America."
The modern styles of the models, he said, in settings that nod to iconic artwork, provide a sense of connection.
"The nuances of the hair-braiding style and nails and phone technology -- it's making it violently present right now. You start to piece together a story based on your own baggage," the artist said about the work. "And certainly that's the through line throughout all of it -- these bodies chopped down."
Wiley said his exhibition, however, is about more than just death. The bright colors, the flowers, the green vines twisting and pushing from the background of his paintings, "demanding to be taken seriously," he said, show even nature's resistance. And the tenderness in his treatment of the bodies offers what he considers minor notes of birth and redemption.

When Kehinde Wiley’s exhibition, “An Archaeology of Silence,” opens in the United States on March 18, the most important room some viewers might enter is one with no artwork at all.
The “respite room” at the de Young Museum in San Francisco will be an area where visitors can take a breath and regain their composure after viewing the display of almost billboard-size paintings and huge sculptures of Black men and women in sometimes crumpled positions — struck down, resting, wounded or dead — in settings that reference iconic Western paintings of religious and mythological subjects.
Among the 25 pieces is “Reclining Nude in Wooded Setting (Edidiong Ikobah),” a painting of a woman in a white tank top, cutoff jean shorts and white sneakers who lies across grassy terrain, her braids bunched atop her head. One 17.5-foot-tall sculpture, titled the same as the exhibition, depicts a limp, shirtless man in jeans and high-tops draped over a majestic horse. Another sculpture, the Virgin Martyr Cecilia (Ndey Buri), shows a lifeless, contorted woman in a miniskirt and sandals lying across the ground.
The show, which debuted last year at the Venice Biennale, has a particular resonance opening in a country reeling from the latest in a string of police killings of Black men — merely one segment of a long national timeline of brutality against Black and brown people.
Wiley made the pieces, an extension of his body of work called “Down,” in the months following the 2020 killing of George Floyd while in police custody. At the time, the artist was waiting out the pandemic at his studio in Dakar, Senegal, and said the pieces were meant to reflect not only U.S. brutality but also the effects of colonialism on Africans. Some of his models were Senegalese men and women whose names appear in parentheses in the titles of the pieces.
“I wanted to create an American story that can be appreciated by all parts of the globe,” Wiley said on a recent afternoon in his sprawling New York City studio, where various works in progress were propped against one long wall. “In America, to be honest, there’s a different type of relevance.”
Aware of that relevance, the de Young — which, with the Legion of Honor, comprises the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco — has coordinated a multipronged effort that considers the impact the images could have on viewers. It is an endeavor undertaken by other museums across the country, which have posted content warnings or installed early exits for exhibits deemed potentially upsetting.
“The U.S. has a special relationship with systemic violence against Black people,” said Abram Jackson, director of interpretation at the Fine Arts Museums, a permanent position the museum created last year.
He has sought the input of community groups for many aspects of the exhibition, including careful parsing of the text that accompanies the art. With the input, for example, text that had read “Black bodies” was changed to “Black people,” and “state-sanctioned violence” was changed to “systemic violence.”
The museum is including workshops on grief with its programming. As part of the staff training, the de Young team met with museum security staffers to offer a preview of the renderings so they are emotionally braced once it opens.
The museum will offer free admission to the exhibition on several weekends, helped by a $1 million grant from Google.org, the company’s philanthropic arm.
At the National Gallery of Art, in Washington, D.C., “content advisories” accompany the new Philip Guston exhibition, which includes Klan-style figures and was designed to allow visitors to easily bypass controversial pieces. A lengthy trigger warning appears with the “Howardena Pindell: A New Language” exhibit at Spike Island in Bristol, England, which addresses slavery, violence against Black and Indigenous people, and the AIDS pandemic. With instructions titled “Self-Care Practice for Self-Regulation: Body Practice and Self-Soothe,” it suggests that viewers “tap the chest area with your fingers to regulate and calm your mind. Take short breaths through the mouth to feel safe.”
Museums are taking these kinds of approaches as they try to expand their audience, yet worry how that audience will react, said Tom Eccles, executive director of Bard College’s Center for Curatorial Studies, who calls them a “contemporary response but not a misguided one.”
“Today we have an expanded notion of harm, and no museum wants to be in the business of creating a context of harm,” he said. “You’re going to get very strong responses from people having experiences that museums are not used to, and how does one accommodate that audience? Museums are literally feeling around in the dark.”
The exhibition by Wiley, who is best known for his presidential portrait of Barack Obama for the National Portrait Gallery that toured America for more than a year, embraces a solemn vibe: dark and almost chapel-like with bright lights on individual pieces. Viewers can fill out response cards to write about the exhibit, which also will have multiple exits for anyone who needs a break.

Early Arrivals Can Capture The Big Prize: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: "Everything Everywhere All at Once" isn't the first top film to have its debut long before awards season. But it is one of the few to go the distance.
When "Everything Everywhere All at Once" made its debut last March at the South by Southwest film festival, followed by a nationwide release the next month, expectations were modest.
Maybe the quirky A24 film about a multiverse-jumping mother striving to finally connect with her daughter -- and busting some martial arts moves along the way -- would make some money. And then "hot dog fingers" mania happened. Seemingly overnight, TikTokers glommed on to the prompt "If the multiverse is real, I hope there's one where ..." and imagined alternate timelines for their lives. Moviegoers across the country flocked to see the film once, twice, nine times. But back in spring 2022, no one could have anticipated the movie's best picture triumph at the Oscars on Sunday night.
Conventional wisdom has it that films released in the fall make stronger contenders. So when "Everything Everywhere" won, it joined a select group of films that were similarly released early -- or early-ish -- in a previous year, and that went on to capture the most coveted prize in Hollywood.
Here are nine times a release in spring or summer -- or, once, even in January -- has gone on to win big.
'Casablanca'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
A release early in the year was not viewed as a competitive disadvantage until the early 1990s, when the former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein's guerrilla-style efforts on behalf of smaller indie films like "The Crying Game" (1992) and "Il Postino" (1995) kicked off the modern era of Oscar campaigning. The World War II-set romantic drama "Casablanca" was actually in good company among the 10 best picture contenders: All but three were released between January and August.
'The Greatest Show on Earth'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In the 1950s, it was common for best picture winners to also be box-office behemoths. "The Greatest Show on Earth," Cecil B. DeMille's 152-minute circus extravaganza, became the highest-grossing film of the year in 1952, thanks to its extended stay in theaters.
'The Sound of Music'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
David Lean's epic romance "Doctor Zhivago," a December release, was the favorite after he won best director for his previous two movies ("The Bridge on the River Kwai" from 1957 and "Lawrence of Arabia" from 1962). But audiences loved Maria -- "The Sound of Music" became the highest-grossing film of 1965 -- and the film won five statuettes, including best picture.
'Midnight Cowboy'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The only X-rated film to ever win best picture hit theaters long before the four other best picture contenders. The idea of releasing awards contenders as close as possible to the date of the ceremony -- just before the eligibility cutoff at the end of the previous year -- so they'd be top of mind for voters was just beginning to take hold and would become common in the 1980s.
'The Godfather'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Paramount brass locked horns with the director Francis Ford Coppola on every major decision, and the studio chief at the time, Robert Evans, fought to push the film's original Christmas 1971 release to the spring to force Coppola to do another edit. (That made the film, which runs nearly three hours, even longer!) To be fair, "The Godfather" would have been Oscars catnip no matter when it was released.
'The Silence of the Lambs'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Like "Everything Everywhere All at Once," "The Silence of the Lambs" was bolstered by huge word of mouth and strong reviews. The cannibalistic thriller -- still the only horror movie to win best picture -- topped the box office for five consecutive weeks after it was released in February 1991. Then it hit VHS just before Halloween, vaulting it back onto voters' radar.
'Forrest Gump'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This crowd-pleasing baby boomer tale was up against a stacked lineup of best picture nominees that included "Pulp Fiction" and "The Shawshank Redemption." But moviegoers had embraced the tale of Tom Hanks's kindhearted Alabamian, and it spent the summer hovering at or near the top of the box office, a run that Oscar voters surely noted.
'Crash'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The divisive, Los Angeles-set race-relations drama pulled off one of the biggest upsets in Oscar history. The gay western "Brokeback Mountain" was an early front-runner and theories abound about why voters gave its filmmaker, Ang Lee, the best director Oscar but the top prize to Paul Haggis's urban drama. In hindsight the win wasn't exactly definitive. In 2012, Film Comment named "Crash" the worst best-picture winner of all time.
'The Hurt Locker'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"The Hurt Locker," Kathryn Bigelow's low-budget American war thriller, had a slow rollout in theaters, going from four to 535 by the end of July. But it racked up strong performances at precursor award shows leading into the Oscars.

Full text: The "Abbott Elementary" star keeps nourished, body and soul, with D'Angelo's music, Earl Grey lattes and early 2000s rom-coms.
Tyler James Williams has had a winning season.
A Screen Actors Guild award that he and his "Abbott Elementary" castmates won for their work on the ABC mockumentary about an underfunded public school in Philadelphia.
A Golden Globe for best supporting actor for his own performance in the series, as Gregory Eddie, a substitute teacher who finds a sense of purpose and permanence in the job.
And, as he took the Globes stage, a standing ovation from Eddie Murphy.
"The award is great -- I appreciate it. But that did more for me than anything ever could," Williams admitted in a video call from Los Angeles.
The actor, 30, has also morphed into something of a heartthrob in the role, which the "Abbott Elementary" creator Quinta Brunson, whom he'd met on "A Black Lady Sketch Show," wrote for him after they became lockdown pals.
All of the accolades don't overshadow what he considers his most significant achievement.
"We haven't seen characters like Gregory and Janine" -- a teacher played by Brunson with whom Gregory has a slow-burn kind of thing -- "exist on television," Williams said.
"There's not a heavy trauma story line. It's just Black people living everyday lives and seeing the beauty in that," he added. "Very rarely do we see that recognized in the awards platforms, so that for me is what I hope that win does."
Still, Williams, who has Crohn's disease, may have never arrived at this moment had he not had a near-fatal flare-up when he was 23.
"When I came out of the other side of it, I realized I had a choice," he said. "I could be really busy and try to make a bunch of money. Or I could do things that felt like my heart was just bathed."
A few days after wrapping the second season of "Abbott" last month, Williams talked about his deep dive into bell hooks's work, how D'Angelo captured the feelings of his youth and the Burberry trench he can't leave behind. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
bell hooks
In 2020, when it became apparent that we were going to be locked down for some time, I was getting book recommendations from people. I had just finished "The United States vs. Billie Holiday," and Miss Lawrence, who was a castmate, had recommended "We Real Cool" by bell hooks. I read it and fell in love with her voice, and felt seen in a way I had never felt seen before, and understood things about myself I didn't know. Then everything she had ever written, I was just diving through. To me they really question masculinity standards, particularly Black masculinity standards, which, with Gregory, I try to dismantle as many of those as I can.
'Voodoo' by D'Angelo
I had to be 8 or 9 the first time I heard that album played in my house. And I was like, "Who did this? Who took my insides and made it sonic?" I listen to that album once every day, usually at the top of the day. D'Angelo, he's kind of everything to me.
CinemaSins
It's a YouTube channel that points out all the tropes and archaic things that happen in our industry, where everything is so austere and we make art. It's usually how I end my night when I'm in bed and winding down. Just to have some guy somewhere break it all down and dismantle it is really funny to me.
Earl Grey Latte
Due to Crohn's, I had to stop drinking coffee when I was younger, and I was a big latte person. So I got this great combination of Earl Grey teas that you mix together. Froth up the milk. It feels like a coffee, but you have the flowery notes that are in the tea. In the wintertime, you could do a dash of nutmeg, even some cinnamon, and a single sugar. And if it's one of those days where it's like, "This is going to be a heavy lift," you do two tea bags.
Skywalker Marijuana
That's my favorite strain. Also Crohn's-related, my doctors wanted me to eat more. My appetite response isn't the same as everybody else's -- I need something to tell me that I'm hungry. And they were like, "Hey, there's marijuana." It seems to do all the things we need it to do.
Tom Ford Candles
I was shooting a show called "Whiskey Cavalier" in Prague, right before "Abbott," and I stumbled on this candle at one of the stores on Parizska Street. There's notes that are very masculine, but then there's this soft powder behind it that's feminine and light. I was like, "This is what I want my house to smell like at all times."
'Brown Sugar'
This movie felt like a story that could happen to me: Two New York kids who love hip-hop could essentially just fall in love over that. It was simple. I'm a huge fan of the '90s/early 2000s rom-com. I feel like we peaked as a society right there.
Gold
There's something about it aesthetically that has always brightened my day. I've tried to get into silver, but it doesn't really do it for me. There's something about the way sun hits gold that the world gets brighter. It's kind of like when you take sunglasses off. Everything becomes more vibrant.
Black Burberry Trench Coat
I don't buy a lot of things, and my closet's very small. I just have stuff that I'm absolutely in love with. And Burberry has always done the trench better than everybody else. It's something that I pull out literally all the time. It goes so perfectly with everything, always. I left it in New York when I came back from Christmas to finish shooting, and I was like, "What am I doing? I have to go back and get this." I need this everywhere I go.
Durags
During the pandemic, my hair was really long. I couldn't see a barber, so I ordered a durag and would put it on. I would compress over and over and over again and just kind of brush it out because I didn't have any other choice. By the time we had shot the pilot of "Abbott," I had been wave brushing for almost a year, and that became Gregory's look.

Full text: "Argentina, 1985" has resurrected the country's military rule, which ended 40 years ago. The quest persists to hold those accused of crimes against humanity accountable.
BUENOS AIRES -- The bones of a man, brought into light in a laboratory, had spoken.
For years, he was kept inside a blue plastic box on a shelf with hundreds of other boxes containing unidentified human remains believed to belong to victims of the brutal military dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983.
Lying on a table in the Buenos Aires headquarters of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team, his skeleton told a story: He was about 25 years old and stood 5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet tall. Five gunshot wounds, one to the head and four to the pelvis, had killed him.
And now, more than 30 years since his discovery in a mass grave, he is on the verge of being identified.
"When they pass from having a number to having a name, it's wonderful," said Patricia Bernardi, a forensic anthropologist and a founder of the team, a nonprofit that works on cases related to abuses committed under military rule.
The identification of victims is part of a broader effort to deliver justice and accountability 40 years after the end of the dictatorship, a traumatic chapter that is in the spotlight again because of "Argentina, 1985," a film that has earned an Oscar nomination for best international feature.
A historical drama, it depicts a real landmark case that a team of lawyers pressed against military leaders in a trial that ended with the convictions of five members of the military junta, including the dictators Jorge Videla and Emilio Massera, who received life sentences. Four others were acquitted.
The military unleashed a wave of repression to eliminate so-called subversives, a category that came to include political dissidents, student activists, labor organizers, journalists, intellectuals and clergy members. Human rights groups estimate that as many as 30,000 people were killed or disappeared during the dictatorship.
In a pivotal scene in the movie, a character based on a real-life prosecutor tells a panel of judges that the trial can help forge a peace based on justice and memorializing the atrocities.
"This is our opportunity," he says. "It may be our last."
Rather than an end, those words, taken from the real closing arguments, were a beginning. To this day, in courtrooms across Argentina, roughly 180 former military officials, police officers and civilians are being prosecuted for crimes against humanity.
With more than 300 open investigations and 14 trials, the process is "permanently alive," said Estela de Carlotto, the president of Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, a human rights organization started by women searching for their grandchildren who were born in captivity to political prisoners and then given to other families.
Some investigations are focused on crimes committed in clandestine detention centers where hundreds of people were tortured and killed. In one case, a former marine captain is on trial for orchestrating the illegal adoption of his brother's daughter, who was born in a detention center and raised by another member of the military. Her parents are still missing.
In total, more than 1,100 military personnel, police officers and civilians have been convicted of crimes against humanity since 2006, including 58 last year.
Argentina's reckoning with its past has been far more extensive than that of neighboring countries also scarred by repressive military rule, including Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. Amnesty laws in Brazil have blocked military trials, while a small number of trials have occurred in Uruguay. Many top officials convicted of dictatorship-era crimes in Chile received reduced sentences.
"These trials are right and necessary," said Maria Ángeles Ramos, one of the lead federal prosecutors of dictatorship-era crimes in Argentina.
"We made this decision that what happened is unforgivable and Argentina cannot afford to ignore its past," Ms. Ramos said. "That is a very big self-critique as a society. It's a value that puts us in a distinctive place in the world."
The pursuit of justice has not been easy. After the 1985 trial of leaders of the junta, the government enacted laws that blocked most other prosecutions. A former president also pardoned the convicted military commanders.
In the 1990s, victims and relatives of those who had disappeared staged protests outside the homes of former military rulers and others believed to have violated human rights.
Teresa Laborde's mother, Adriana Calvo, a physicist and university professor, was a key witness at the 1985 trial. She described having been handcuffed and blindfolded and calling out for the baby she had just delivered in the back seat of a Ford Falcon as she was moved from one clandestine detention center to another.
The newborn was Ms. Laborde, now 45. She and her mother were eventually released.
"That trial that everyone says was an example, in my house we lived it as the gateway to impunity," Ms. Laborde said, referring to the acquittal of four of the leaders and light sentences for some others. "Justice meant holding the last torturer responsible."
A pivotal moment came in 2003, when the Argentine Congress, responding to mounting public pressure, abolished the laws that had halted prosecutions of dictatorship-era crimes. In 2006, a court handed down the first sentence under a relaunched prosecution process.
"In some sense, it was all of civil society that built this," said Natalia Federman, a human rights lawyer and executive director of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team. "It became impossible for the state to say, We're not going to do anything."
The forensic team's work has been a key part of trials. More than 1,400 bodies have been recovered, with around 800 identified -- some washed up on beaches after being hurled from planes during so-called death flights. Others, like the man in the forensic team's laboratory, were discovered in unmarked graves.
The team is keeping details about the man confidential until his identification is confirmed, but he is believed to have been a prisoner of one of the dictatorship's detention centers. Evidence that emerged in trials involving people he was buried with helped analysts piece together a hypothesis about his identity.
It underscores how trials are a crucial part of "building memory," Ms. Ramos said, "so we all know what occurred and we talk about it."
Argentina's military generally does not discuss the continuing investigations and trials, and its rank and file are now made up entirely of officers who joined after the dictatorship.
"We do everything possible -- and the continuity of the trials has to do with that -- to ensure that what happened is not forgotten," said Eduardo Jozami, who works as director of human rights at the Defense Ministry and who was imprisoned during the dictatorship.
But time is a looming enemy: More than 1,000 people under investigation have died, and so have victims and their relatives.
"There is a slowness, sometimes an indifference," Ms. de Carlotto said of the pace of justice. "But our permanence and resistance is present."
At a trial of crimes at clandestine detention centers, Laura Treviño recalled the early hours of Sept. 11, 1976, when she was 18. Six men in civilian clothes arrived at her family's home in a city near Buenos Aires and took away her 17-year-old brother.
The men claimed to be part of the army and asked about the teenager, Victor Treviño, a left-wing activist agitating for lower student transit fares.
The men, some of them wearing ski masks and carrying guns, went to the back of the home, Ms. Treviño testified.
She heard a commotion as they ordered her brother to dress. As the men led him out, his mother asked where he was being taken.
"'You'll find out soon,' they told her," Ms. Treviño testified. But they never did.
"That's what we all want: to know what happened to him," she testified. "To all of them."

Before You Make It Big, You've Got to Pay the Bills: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A group show at the Blanton Museum of Art breaks the taboo on artists discussing, and drawing on, their day jobs. Yet this stigma still exists.
There's a scene in the 1996 movie "Basquiat" where the incandescent young painter (played by Jeffrey Wright) has a handyman gig at a gallery. Willem Dafoe, making a cameo as an electrician, climbs down a ladder and delivers the immortal line: "You know, I'm an artist too." Here are the two sides of the myth: the obscure martyr unsoiled by commercial success; and the unbridled genius who can't help but have it all.
In reality, most artists, even most great ones, also have day jobs. During the late 1950s and early 60s, the staff at MoMA harbored grand ambitions. The painters Robert Ryman and Robert Mangold were guards, curator and critic Lucy Lippard a "page" in the museum library, minimalist Sol LeWitt worked the desk and sculptor Dan Flavin ran the elevator. (Miriam Takaezu, an employee in Personnel and sister to the famous ceramist Toshiko Takaezu, apparently took it upon herself to hire artists.)
Work from this MoMA cohort introduces "Day Jobs," a group show of 38 artists at the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas. The exhibition blows through the polite separation between artwork and money work. Not only does it name, in wall label after wall label, what each artist did to keep the lights on -- it demonstrates how artists drew techniques, subjects, even inspiration from their diurnal grind.
Put another way, the show refutes the idea of the spontaneous generation of masterpieces. Far from it. Great artists need the world, maybe more than it needs them. "I think we overlook how much mundane moments can shape creative discoveries and directions," the curator, Veronica Roberts, who's now the director of Stanford University's Cantor Arts Center, told me. When Frank Stella moved to New York in 1958, he painted houses. In 1959, he had his precocious MoMA debut: canvases covered with black enamel stripes the width of a housepainter's brush. "When we view artists as living in this rarefied realm," Roberts said, "we do a disservice to ourselves and to them."
Which might be why the "Worst Job Ever," a recent help wanted ad from an "Art World Family" seeking a combination personal assistant, babysitter, gardener and "dog systems" manager for less than $ 100,000 a year, got people's hackles up. It wasn't so much the conditions (unfortunately common enough), not even the post's arch tone -- but the fact that there was an artist behind it, asking to escape the surly gravity that holds the rest of us down: trying to be an artist without the world.
Why is it so hard to acknowledge that artists work for money? The art business puts the precariat and the bourgeoisie in proximity, which can certainly breed resentment. But it's more than that. In the Basquiat/Electrician dualism, we're given to believe that true talent will be rewarded, while those who change light bulbs for a living just aren't that good. In the myth of artistic meritocracy, a day job is the mark of failure.
Pressure also comes from fellow artists. Virginia L. Montgomery, a video artist in "Day Jobs," told me one of her (more privileged) classmates at Yale called her a sellout because she worked. Howardena Pindell, also in the show, climbed the ladder as a curator at MoMA for over a decade while developing her style of abstract, pointillist collage. (She had two separate résumés.) Pindell recalls misguided peers blaming her for gatekeeping. "One African American woman artist would heckle me in public settings and call me at home with veiled threats," she told me, "and would say I was the reason MoMA did not collect her work."
"Artists have this ambivalent relationship to their day jobs," said Hannah Wohl, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California Santa Barbara and the author of a book on creativity and the art world. Day jobs provide stability through the feast-or-famine cycles of gallery sales. At the same time, "being able to give up your day job is a sign of upward mobility."
Still, it's not that simple. A job also signals a certain salt-of-the-earth authenticity. "I'm thinking of one instance of a gallerist who was bragging about starting to represent an artist while they still taught at the Y.M.C.A.," said Wohl. "Or another dealer bragging about how she started representing this artist who used to be an art handler at her gallery."
"Like everyone else," said Wohl, "artists want their success to appear deserved. I've noticed that artists with wealthy families and family connections often downplay these advantages. One way they do this is by having a day job and acting like this is something they need. It's more shameful in some ways to not need a day job than to have one."
All of the artists in "Day Jobs" needed their gigs at the time. Jeff Koons, aptly represented at the Blanton by his gleaming steel bust of Sun King Louis XIV, was a successful commodities broker before he conquered the art market. (He also sold MoMA memberships.) Even Andy Warhol got his start illustrating shoe ads.
But maybe quitting isn't the goal. "I'm grateful that I have a day job," said Montgomery, one of two artists in "Day Jobs" who still have theirs. "If I was constantly thinking about myself and my own needs all the time, I would go a bit crazy." Montgomery works as a graphic facilitator, transcribing corporate brainstorming sessions and TED talks into symbols in real time. Her videos are likewise full of morphing and empathic imagery, like a luna moth hatching from a ponytail. Ragen Moss, a lawyer since 2005, sculpts bodily, glassy, cocoon-like forms inscribed with legalese. Because of her career, she told me, "I feel authorized to ask huge questions: Where did law begin? What is it for? Who does it serve?"
I asked both Moss and Montgomery if they would quit if they could. Neither said yes. Their jobs ground their art in experience. And both mentioned the value of coming into contact with different kinds of people -- a point echoed throughout "Day Jobs" under subheadings like "Caregivers" and "Service Industry." Violette Bule's "Dream America," a photographic diptych of a dishwasher carrying a tray of red, white and blue plates and the stars and stripes, evokes August Sander's famous portrait of a bulging, burdened bricklayer. Bule's restaurant job brought her intimate knowledge of the tenacity and exploitation underlying more abstract debates about immigration. The art is stronger for it: less topical, more enduring.
Inside access can also sharpen critique. Barbara Kruger, known for pithy feminist slogans and bold graphics that have become selfie magnets, designed and edited magazines.
And Matthew Angelo Harrison, an emerging artist from Detroit, modeled prototypes for Ford with 3-D printers and CNC routers, then adapted that technology to print clay copies of looted artifacts. At the Blanton, Harrison contributes a "found" West African statue alongside a car headlight, both vitrified in resin, in a caustic conflation of industry and imperialism.
As Roberts admits, curating the show, she sidestepped two huge categories of common artist gigs: teaching, and assisting other artists. A work by Manuel Rodríguez-Delgado involving a climate-sealed notebook and custom shipping crates glances off the unwieldy category of preparator work, and the wall label for Sol LeWitt's "Wall Drawing #48," per his instructions, names the people who drew it. Who hung the rest of the "Day Jobs" show? Who will secret it away when it's done? That crate would take more than one exhibition to unpack.
The need for such a reckoning is evident in the 115,000 followers of Art Handler magazine, an Instagram account and erstwhile journal focused on the art world's back of house. Clynton Lowry, an art handler and artist who has shown at the Kitchen, in New York, started the project in 2015. "I was interested in hearing artists not just describing these jobs as a sideline," Lowry told me, "but something that's integrated in their lives, and in their thinking as artists."
While union drives might make the news, it falls to Art Handler to represent, and advocate for, that profession's particular view of culture. Lowry makes the point that the art world praises certain multihyphenates -- curator-dealer-writers or artist-educators. But that clout "isn't translating to these below-the-line roles."
The label on my own canned latte says it's so inspiring I might quit my day job. A subway ad for an art school tells me, if I love what I do, it's not work. The semiotic landscape of consumer society urges us to pretend that gigs are art forms, when in fact they're just jobs that sap your creativity. Of course, says society, if you want to be a true artist, you can always suffer and starve. In this light, the intertwined but distinct relationship of artworks and day jobs is something to be recognized, and protected: no shame in saying, "You know, I'm an artist too." And no shame in confiding: "You know, I'm an art handler too." You don't have to be poor to be a great artist. You do have to live in the world.

Singing While They Stay Gold: [Review]

Full text: At La Jolla Playhouse, the musical adaptation of the novel and film has considerable appeal, but is weighed down by too many characters and themes.
LA JOLLA, Calif. -- No one sings during the rumble scene in "The Outsiders," a new musical at La Jolla Playhouse adapted from S.E. Hinton's 1967 novel of teenage alienation and Francis Ford Coppola's 1983 film version. The nine-person orchestra -- guitar, bass, drums, keyboard, some mournful strings -- stays silent, too. Instead, young bodies, about 20 of them, supply their own percussive music, falling to the cork-covered floor, groaning into their mikes, as stage rain soaks them through.
This violence is for show, of course. Those kicks and punches don't actually connect. But the brawl, at least at first, is not aestheticized. It's a fistfight, not a dance -- brutal, futile, wet, raw and sad.
"The Outsiders," despite its considerable appeal, can't yet bear too much reality. Awkward, yearning, fast on its feet, the show, like the adolescents it describes, is still trying on various identities. Directed by Danya Taymor from a book by Adam Rapp, with gorgeous, mournful music and lyrics from Jonathan Clay and Zach Chance, of Jamestown Revival, and Justin Levine, this La Jolla version (and I'm sentimental enough to hope that there will soon be other versions) is a musical with growing pains, currently serving too many characters, too many themes, too many styles. But when it reaches its full height, it might really be something to see.
Largely faithful to the book and for better or worse, to the film, which a New York Times critic once witheringly described as "a laughably earnest attempt to impose heroic attitudes on some nice, small characters," the show is set in 1967 Tulsa, Okla. Amid an environment of vacant lots and broken-down cars (the set, inventive and peculiar, is by Amp featuring Tatiana Kahvegian), it maps the increasingly bloody conflict between the Greasers, the East side have-nots who inspire the title, and the Socs, short for "socialites," the West side haves.
In the book and the movie, both gangs are white and all male. Here the Greasers have been effortlessly yet thoughtfully diversified. (Sarafina Bush's vivid, considered costumes keep the gang distinctions clear.) There is at least one other significant departure, involving the death of a beloved character, but this, too, is purposeful and apt.
The overarching concern of "The Outsiders" are the ways in which these teenagers, largely abandoned by their elders, misunderstand the world and one another. At the febrile center of the story is Ponyboy Curtis (played here by Brody Grant), an orphaned 14-year-old who lives with his older brothers, Sodapop (Jason Schmidt) and Darrel (Ryan Vasquez), both of whom have left school to support him.
A sweet kid with a poet's soul, Ponyboy stays up late reading Charles Dickens and glories in sunsets. "Robert Frost is quite talented," he tells Cherry Valance (Piper Patterson), the Soc goddess he meets at a drive-in. (Frost's brief ode to youth and decay, "Nothing Gold Can Stay," runs through "The Outsiders" as a leitmotif.) But when a phalanx of drunken Socs attack him and his best friend, Johnny Cade (Sky Lakota-Lynch), Ponyboy finds himself enmeshed in the local violence.
The great allure of the book, and now the musical, are the big feelings that it illustrates and invites. Hinton wrote the book while still in high school and maybe because she was a woman (the S.E. stands for Susan Eloise), she articulated for her male characters rich and ardent emotional lives, which fuel the musical's plaintive score. Though "The Outsiders" -- in every form -- argues that it is often easier to hate than to love and understand, it does not hesitate to show the passionate relationships (never erotic, but often with a force that borders the romantic) among the Greasers.
The show makes a few correctable missteps. An opening number, directly referencing the opening lines of the book and with projections by Tal Yarden, focuses on Paul Newman in "Cool Hand Luke," an odd distraction (and a tenuous reference for the under-50 crowd) when we haven't yet met the principal characters.
Only in the third number, "Grease Got a Hold on You," does the story's engine finally catch. (Given the preexistence of "Grease" and "Hairspray," an alternate title for the show could have been "Pomade.") There's also an incidence of hand-holding, pushing a platonic friendship toward the romantic, that feels strained, especially given Hinton's stalwart displacement of sexuality. A climactic scene involving a fire is not yet convincingly staged.
There are trickier hitches, too. This is Ponyboy's story, yet he is hardly its most compelling character. And despite Grant's earnest, lush-voiced performance, the eye moves inexorably toward other figures, like Vasquez's Darrel and Patterson's Cherry and Lakota-Lynch's Johnny and especially Da'Von T. Moody's Dallas, a muscled hood with a gangster's pose and a big, wounded heart beneath it, who can twirl a baseball bat like a majorette's baton.
Though Taymor, aided by the design team and the choreographers Rick and Jeff Kuperman, manages some striking and playful images, the relationship between the real and the symbolic remains uneasy. (Are we always in the vacant lot? Is this some junkyard passion play? Why is a car now vertical?) And "The Outsiders" sometimes throttles its own exuberance. Taymor ("Heroes of the Fourth Turning," "Pass Over") hasn't yet worked out how to offer a work that feels dangerous and true without flattening the pleasures that a musical can provide.
If "The Outsiders" means to steer its muscle cars toward Broadway, which it should, further development will almost certainly smooth these variances in focus and approach. Even now, such discord has a way of receding when the youthful, gifted performers are freed to do what they do best: to move and to sing.
Musically, the score is polyglot, borrowing confidently from folk, bluegrass and rockabilly traditions, with occasional gestures toward soul and Broadway balladry. This is a story about conflict, internal and external, but it also allows, in songs such as "Great Expectations" and "Stay Gold," for luxuriant and surprising concordance. For the hopeless, for the loveless, for the misunderstood, which is all of us, Greaser and Soc, young and old, "The Outsiders" offers the promise of harmony.

Ricou Browning, 93; Raised Goose Bumps as the Gill Man: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He helped bring "Flipper" to the movies and TV but was best known for his plunge in a monster suit in "Creature From the Black Lagoon."
Ricou Browning, who played the title character, or at least the underwater version of it, in one of the most enduring creature features of the 1950s, "Creature From the Black Lagoon," died on Feb. 27 at his home in Southwest Ranches, Fla., northwest of Miami. He was 93.
His daughter Renee Le Feuvre confirmed the death.
Mr. Browning was 23 when Newt Perry, a promoter of various Florida attractions for whom he had worked as a teenager, asked him to show some Hollywood visitors around Wakulla Springs, a picturesque spot near Tallahassee. The entourage -- which, as Mr. Browning told the story later, included Jack Arnold, the film's director, and the cameraman Scotty Welbourne -- was scouting locations for a planned movie about an underwater monster.
"Scotty had his underwater camera," Mr. Browning recalled in an interview recorded in "The Creature Chronicles: Exploring the Black Lagoon Trilogy," a 2014 book by Tom Weaver (with David Schecter and Steve Kronenberg), "and he asked me if I would get in the water with him and swim in front of the camera so they could get some perspective."
Mr. Arnold not only liked the location; he also liked Mr. Browning. He called him days later and asked if he would want to play the creature for the underwater scenes to be shot in Florida. (An actor named Ben Chapman portrayed the monster in the scenes on land, which were filmed in California.)
"We've tested a lot of people for this part," Mr. Browning recalled Mr. Arnold telling him, "but I'd like to have you play the creature -- I like your swimming."
In August 1953 he was brought to California to be fitted for the suit that would turn him into the Gill Man, and six months later "Creature From the Black Lagoon" was released. It was the latest in a tradition of monster movies from Universal Studios that included "The Mummy" (1932) and "The Wolf Man" (1941), and it took its place in monster movie lore.
In the film, which was released in 3-D, scientists working in the Amazon discover a creature in a lagoon that takes a shine to a female member of the party, Kay (played by Julie Adams). About 28 minutes into the film, Kay decides to go for a swim in the lagoon, and the creature, still undiscovered by the research party, swims beneath her like an underwater stalker, a scene both creepy and oddly poignant.
"This scene turned it from a regular old monster movie to a 'Beauty and the Beast' thing," Mr. Weaver said by email, "a big reason for the movie's ongoing popularity."

Some critics weren't impressed by the movie.
"The proceedings above and under water were filmed in 3-D to impart an illusion of depth when viewed through polarized glasses," A.H. Weiler wrote in The New York Times. "This adventure has no depth."
Yet the movie did decently at the box office and became a sort of cultural reference point. Mr. Browning, who had the ability to hold his breath underwater for minutes at a time, played the swimming version of the creature in two sequels, "Revenge of the Creature" (1955) and "The Creature Walks Among Us" (1956).
He went on to share a story-writing credit on the 1963 film "Flipper," about a boy who becomes friends with a dolphin, and then, the next year, was a creator of the television series of the same name and directed and helped write a number of its episodes during its three seasons. He also did some of the underwater stunt work.
In an introductory essay in Mr. Weaver's book, Ms. Adams, whose "Black Lagoon" character was played by Ginger Stanley in the underwater scenes, recalled waiting eagerly in California to see the "dailies" -- footage from the day's shooting -- coming out of Florida.
"The dailies were long, silent takes of him and Ginger Stanley deep in the crystal clear water of Wakulla Springs," she wrote. "They'd swim for a while, get some air from an air hose, and then go back and resume their action. It was so exciting to see the Gill Man brought to life by Ricou's unique swimming style, and I was captivated."
Ms. Stanley, Mr. Browning's underwater partner in that eerie scene that helped define the film, died in January in Orlando, Fla., at 91.
Ricou Ren Browning was born on Feb. 16, 1930, in Fort Pierce, Fla. His father, Clement, worked construction in the Navy, and his mother, Inez (Ricou) Browning, was a bookkeeper.
He first saw Wakulla Springs as a teenager and earned some money by swimming deep in the water for the benefit of tourists in glass-bottomed boats, who would watch him plunge to depths of 80 feet and leave tips.
"Some of us kids would earn 30, 40 dollars a day," he told Mr. Weaver for his book, "and that was big, big money."
In the 1940s he also got his first taste of the movie business, appearing in several short films made in the area by Grantland Rice, who was better known as a sportswriter. In one, according to Mr. Weaver's book, Mr. Browning is among the teenagers packed into a Model T Ford that drives into the waters of Wakulla Springs.
After serving in the Air Force from 1947 to 1950, Mr. Browning returned to Florida. He was the underwater double for Forrest Tucker in "Crosswinds" (1951), an adventure story about an effort to recover gold from a sunken plane, which was filmed in Florida. He was performing in Mr. Perry's underwater shows at Weeki Wachee, another Florida attraction, and studying physical education at Florida State University when he was recruited for "Creature From the Black Lagoon."
In his book, Mr. Weaver recounts the hit-or-miss process of coming up with the right creature costume, and the difficulties Mr. Browning had to deal with once the right look was found. One problem was that the costume was made of foam rubber, which floats.
"I wore a chest plate that was thin lead," Mr. Browning told him, as well as thigh and ankle weights.
Another problem, Mr. Weaver said, was that Mr. Chapman, the actor playing the on-land version of the creature, was quite tall; in Florida, Mr. Browning had scenes with Ms. Stanley and several other stand-ins.
"Ricou was average height," Mr. Weaver said, "so short people were hired to play the hero-heroine-bad guy so that Ricou would look comparatively king-sized."
Mr. Browning's later film work included directing the comedy "Salty" (1973), about a sea lion, and the crime drama "Mr. No Legs" (1978), about a mob enforcer who is a double amputee, as well as doing stunt work in several movies, including serving as Jerry Lewis's underwater double in the 1959 comedy "Don't Give Up the Ship."
Mr. Browning's first marriage, to Margaret Kelly in 1951, ended in divorce. His second wife, Fran Ravelo, whom he married in 1977, died in 2020. In addition to his daughter Renee, he is survived by three other children from his first marriage, his sons, Kelly and Ricou Jr., and his daughter Kim Browning; 10 grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren.
Mr. Weaver noted that all of the other actors who portrayed monsters in the classic Universal films died some time ago.
"Ricou," he said, "had the distinction of being the last man standing."

Ricou Browning, who played the title character, or at least the underwater version of it, in one of the most enduring creature features of the 1950s, “Creature From the Black Lagoon,” died Feb. 27 at his home in Southwest Ranches, Florida, northwest of Miami. He was 93.
His daughter Renee Le Feuvre confirmed the death.
Browning was 23 when Newt Perry, a promoter of various Florida attractions for whom he had worked as a teenager, asked him to show some Hollywood visitors around Wakulla Springs, a picturesque spot near Tallahassee.

Full text: A familiar melody, a skill comes in handy and more reader tales of New York City in this week's Metropolitan Diary.
Switching to the A
Dear Diary:
I was taking the subway from my apartment in Carroll Gardens to Washington Heights to have dinner with my girlfriend and her parents.
Ordinarily, I would keep my AirPods planted firmly in my ears for such a trip, but this time I was engrossed in a recent magazine profile of Francis Ford Coppola that focused on his plans to sink a chunk of his fortune into a passion project called Megalopolis.
When the F train I was on got to West Fourth, I stopped reading while switching to the A. Once I got situated, I eagerly returned to the article, staring intently at my phone screen like seemingly everyone else around me.
I barely noticed when a man got on carrying a trombone. He took a spot by the center pole and started to play a distinct, lilting melody -- one it took me a second to place. Once I did, I laughed to myself and put down my phone to watch him finish the song.
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen," he said, walking down the aisle. "That was the theme from 'The Godfather."'
Then he exited the car.
-- Chris Stanton
Special Skill
Dear Diary:
It was a lovely evening. My wife Andrea and I were walking down a mostly empty street in Brooklyn, returning from a funeral. I was quickly running out of relatives of a certain age.
A man who was walking in the opposite direction veered straight toward us, stopped abruptly and garbled a question through clenched teeth.
I answered, and he walked away. My wife was confused.
I explained that he had been asking for directions with a broken jaw that was wired shut.
Wow, she said, what are the chances he would ask the only person around who could understand him?
My years of being a dentist and talking to people with mouths full of cotton had finally been useful outside the office.
-- Sal Selvaggio
Weekend in Flushing
Dear Diary:
My boyfriend had planned a staycation weekend in Flushing for my birthday. We invited all of our friends to join us for an epic overnight of feasting.
We started at the New World Mall food court with mala dry pot and crispy pork dumplings. I filled up quickly but managed to free up space during a walk to the Ganesh temple for the famous dosas and uttapams.
Next up: drinks at a local watering hole with a sizable outdoor space. I nursed a single beer and switched to water, prepping myself for our Korean barbecue dinner.
It didn't disappoint, and we were treated to endless banchan alongside Mapo's signature galbi (and, of course. plenty of soju.)
Karaoke was next, naturally. We sang along to Nicki Minaj, Abba, Billy Joel for hours.
"This is crazy" my boyfriend began, "but I could eat ... "
Twenty minutes later we were at Hahm Ji Bach tucking into kimchi and pork belly. I couldn't believe I was still eating.
The next morning, we pushed onward, sitting for dim sum at Asian Jewels. Other friends joined us, reviving our energy and appetites. Plates of shu mai and turnip cakes appeared and then disappeared in a blur.
We waddled outside. Next up was hot pot.
I turned to my boyfriend.
"This has been great," I said, "but ... "
"Should we call it?" he said.
I nodded.
We took the subway home. Dinner was salad.

Stars Over Central Park
Dear Diary:
The dead are the dirt
that heave up green
notes in the hot dusk
to break the glass
of this islet
riverine sliver
in granite and light
it splits the Hudson flow
into brackish eternities
as we divide the divine
into imagined blood rites
and blank sky painted
by starlings -- lying
in the lawn that patches
this cinder ball
backs to a tumid star
our eyes listen to hear
curtained constellations tell
old tales in the pallid night
but our scrambled senses drown
in echoes of that ancient
cosmic shriek -- now
the stale staccato sky
holds mostly light of inbounds
to Newark -- yet
science webs thoughts
they telescope
to the imagined edge
where murmured skies
were once a glittering
coal bed and tin moons
rose and fell on rocks roots
and strange wings
what if a young Whitman
once lay on this very grass
and cried -- my,
how crickets then sung
the milky night
to unseen windows
beyond unseen stars
-- G.R. Kramer
First Apartment
Dear Diary:
I was furnishing my first apartment, circa 1982. I bought a velour sofa, a Ming-style side table and a lamp with a porcelain Chinese goddess base at Macy's.
I decided to return the lamp. When I got to the store, there was a long line at the return counter.
As I was waiting, the man ahead of me turned around, looked at me and then looked at the lamp.
"Take it home and learn to love it," he said and turned back around.

Lawmakers Push Biden To Act on Child Labor: [National Desk]

Full text: Members of Congress are pressing for changes to the law and the Biden administration's approach as federal and state enforcement agencies begin a crackdown on companies that employ underage migrants.
Members of Congress are pressing for stricter laws to prevent and penalize the use of child labor and tougher vetting by the Biden administration of adults who take custody of unaccompanied migrant children, as revelations about the exploitation of underage migrants by employers have prompted outrage among policymakers.
Days after an investigation by The New York Times revealed the explosive growth of migrant child labor in the United States, federal and state enforcement agencies have begun a crackdown on companies that employ children, and the Biden administration is under pressure to make broader changes to the way it deals with minors who arrive in the country without their parents.
Top Senate Democrats sent a letter Friday demanding answers from the secretaries of the federal health and labor agencies by April 1, saying they were "deeply disturbed" that "large numbers of unaccompanied noncitizen children are being placed with exploitative sponsors and working long hours in dangerous conditions."
The letter, organized by Senator Richard J. Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, raised concerns that the agencies in charge of those minors might be "prioritizing speed of placing children with sponsors over the children's safety and well-being."
The Health and Human Services Department, whose Office of Refugee Resettlement is in charge of housing migrant children, is supposed to ensure that sponsors protect migrants in their care from trafficking or exploitation.
But as more and more children have crossed the border, the Biden administration has pushed to release them from overburdened shelters as quickly as possible. Xavier Becerra, the department's secretary, has pressured staff members to move with the speed of an assembly line, The Times found. On Monday, officials said they were conducting a four-week internal audit of the vetting process.
The letter came as Republicans in Congress have been savaging the administration for allowing the shadow work force to grow. Mr. Durbin and other Democrats also are proposing tough new legislation to increase maximum civil fines and criminal penalties for violations of child labor laws, as well as make it more difficult for employers to get around existing prohibitions against hiring minors.
"The basic problem is this law is old and the penalties are so low as to be a joke," Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii and the lead sponsor of the bill, said in an interview, adding that he was working to persuade Republicans to back his measure. "This is a growing problem and a perennial problem. We are playing with fire as a nation."
On Thursday, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York announced a statewide campaign to crack down on these labor violations. Among other measures, New York will create an anti-trafficking unit focused on immigrant workers, and establish a child labor task force that will work with schools and businesses.
State and federal enforcement agencies were focusing on Grand Rapids, Mich., where The Times found many migrant children working dangerous factory jobs. Federal investigators were looking into whether children who have been making cereal and car parts were victims of labor trafficking and will be conducting forensic interviews, according to two officials at the Homeland Security Department who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation.
The Michigan attorney general's office also was looking into the case, and state and federal labor agencies were investigating Hearthside Food Solutions, which runs 39 plants in the United States. Workers at Hearthside locations around the country said it had shut down some production lines this week and let go of workers hired through staffing agencies. Representatives for Hearthside and the company's owners, Partners Group and Charlesbank Capital Partners, did not respond to requests for comment.
Senators were pressuring the Justice Department to get involved.
At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat of California, pressed Attorney General Merrick B. Garland on whether the Justice Department would work on criminal referrals against companies involved in exploiting children. He chastised the Health and Human Services Department, saying it had failed to provide "adequate follow-up services" once unaccompanied immigration children are released to a sponsor.
Mr. Garland said he was "horrified" by the revelations in the Times investigation, and would be contacting the labor and health departments about them.
The developments came after the Biden administration on Monday announced a wide crackdown on the labor exploitation of migrant children around the United States, including more aggressive investigations of companies benefiting from their work.
The New York Times investigation documented the growth of migrant child labor in all 50 states. Children, who have been crossing the southern border without their parents in record numbers since 2021, are ending up by the thousands in punishing jobs that flout child labor laws, The Times found.
Biden administration officials said they planned to initiate investigations in parts of the country more likely to have child labor violations and ask Congress to increase penalties. Federal investigators have long complained that the maximum fine for violations -- about $ 15,000 per occurrence -- is not enough of a deterrent.
Mr. Schatz's bill would substantially increase penalties for violating child labor laws to a maximum fine of $ 132,270 for routine violations and a maximum fine of $ 601,150 for each violation connected with the death or serious injury of a minor. It would also increase criminal penalties for a repeat or willful violation of child labor laws to a maximum of a year in jail. And it would apply those laws to independent contractors who are currently exempt, an aspect of the law that some employers have exploited by hiring children through staffing agencies.
"Kids belong in lunch lines, not assembly lines," Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said in a statement. "More can and must be done to protect children, including migrant children, and the Senate will look at every option to prevent children from being exploited."
Representative James Comer, Republican of Kentucky and the chairman of the Oversight Committee, said he would demand information from the Department of Health and Human Services about its "abject failure to ensure the safety of migrant children."
Every major advocacy and service group that works with migrant children called this week for President Biden to respond by giving the children immediate access to legal representation and case management to prevent them from falling into labor exploitation.
"The Biden administration must make right the protection system that failed unaccompanied children, and all children exploited for labor," said Mario Bruzzone, senior policy adviser at the Women's Refugee Commission. "We need accountability from the brands that profit from child labor, and every unaccompanied child must have a lawyer to safeguard the child's rights."
The Health and Human Services Department said on Thursday that its staff would work with Congress to provide case management to all migrant children within the next two years, but currently most are still sent to sponsors with little but the phone number for a national hotline, which until Monday did not have a policy of calling children back.
A senior administration official said there may not be enough lawyers specialized in legal services for unaccompanied migrant children to provide universal representation.
Pressure is also building on the companies to eliminate child labor from their supply chains.
The Times reported that in Michigan, children make auto parts at companies that supply Ford and General Motors. One of the suppliers, the publicly traded company ABC Technologies, said in a statement that it took the issue seriously and was conducting an outside audit.
Sister Schubert's Homemade Rolls, which is owned by the publicly traded company Lancaster Colony Corporation, said it had been unaware children were working in its plant, but was now investigating. Walmart and Target, which sell the rolls, have said they are investigating as well.
Gaspar Morales, who worked for Sister Schubert's until August, said he regularly saw children as young as 12 and 13 putting in 10-hour overnight shifts at the factory, and sometimes helped them get hired through a temp agency.
"I help everybody out. Some people don't like young kids working, but I'll give them a chance," he said. He said he tried to keep children away from the industrial freezers.

Members of Congress are pressing for stricter laws to prevent and penalize the use of child labor and tougher vetting by the Biden administration of adults who take custody of unaccompanied migrant children, as revelations about the exploitation of underage migrants by employers have prompted outrage among policymakers.
Days after an investigation by The New York Times revealed the explosive growth of migrant child labor in the United States, federal and state enforcement agencies have begun a crackdown on companies that employ children, and the Biden administration is under pressure to make broader changes to the way it deals with minors who arrive in the country without their parents.
Top Senate Democrats sent a letter Friday demanding answers from the secretaries of the federal health and labor agencies by April 1, saying they were “deeply disturbed” that “large numbers of unaccompanied noncitizen children are being placed with exploitative sponsors and working long hours in dangerous conditions.”
The letter, organized by Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat and chair of the Judiciary Committee, raised concerns that the agencies in charge of those minors might be “prioritizing speed of placing children with sponsors over the children’s safety and well-being.”
The Health and Human Services Department, whose Office of Refugee Resettlement is in charge of housing migrant children, is supposed to ensure that sponsors protect migrants in their care from trafficking or exploitation.
But as more and more children have crossed the border, the Biden administration has pushed to release them from overburdened shelters as quickly as possible. Xavier Becerra, the department’s secretary, has pressured staff members to move with the speed of an assembly line, the Times found. On Monday, officials said they were conducting a four-week internal audit of the vetting process.
The letter came as Republicans in Congress have been savaging the administration for allowing the shadow workforce to grow. Durbin and other Democrats also are proposing tough new legislation to increase maximum civil fines and criminal penalties for violations of child labor laws, as well as make it more difficult for employers to get around existing prohibitions against hiring minors.
“The basic problem is this law is old and the penalties are so low as to be a joke,” Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, the lead sponsor of the bill, said in an interview, adding that he was working to persuade Republicans to back his measure. “This is a growing problem and a perennial problem. We are playing with fire as a nation.”
On Thursday, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York announced a statewide campaign to crack down on these labor violations. Among other measures, New York will create an anti-trafficking unit focused on immigrant workers, and establish a child labor task force that will work with schools and businesses.
State and federal enforcement agencies were focusing on Grand Rapids, Michigan, where the Times found many migrant children working dangerous factory jobs. Federal investigators were looking into whether children who have been making cereal and car parts were victims of labor trafficking and will be conducting forensic interviews, according to two officials at the Homeland Security Department who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation.
The Michigan attorney general’s office also was looking into the case, and state and federal labor agencies were investigating Hearthside Food Solutions, which runs 39 plants in the United States. Workers at Hearthside locations around the country said it had shut down some production lines this week and let go of workers hired through staffing agencies. Representatives for Hearthside and the company’s owners, Partners Group and Charlesbank Capital Partners, did not respond to requests for comment.
Senators were pressuring the Justice Department to get involved.
At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday, Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., pressed Attorney General Merrick Garland on whether the Justice Department would work on criminal referrals against companies involved in exploiting children. He chastised the Health and Human Services Department, saying it had failed to provide “adequate follow-up services” once unaccompanied immigrant children are released to a sponsor.
Garland said he was “horrified” by the revelations in the Times investigation, and would be contacting the labor and health departments about them.
The developments came after the Biden administration on Monday announced a wide crackdown on the labor exploitation of migrant children around the United States, including more aggressive investigations of companies benefiting from their work.
The Times investigation documented the growth of migrant child labor in all 50 states. Children, who have been crossing the southern border without their parents in record numbers since 2021, are ending up by the thousands in punishing jobs that flout child labor laws, the Times found.
Biden administration officials said they planned to initiate investigations in parts of the country more likely to have child labor violations and ask Congress to increase penalties. Federal investigators have long complained that the maximum fine for violations — about $15,000 per occurrence — is not enough of a deterrent.
Schatz’s bill would substantially increase penalties for violating child labor laws to a maximum fine of $132,270 for routine violations and a maximum fine of $601,150 for each violation connected with the death or serious injury of a minor. It would also increase criminal penalties for a repeat or willful violation of child labor laws to a maximum of a year in jail. And it would apply those laws to independent contractors who are currently exempt, an aspect of the law that some employers have exploited by hiring children through staffing agencies.
“Kids belong in lunch lines, not assembly lines,” Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader, said in a statement. “More can and must be done to protect children, including migrant children, and the Senate will look at every option to prevent children from being exploited.”
Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., chair of the Oversight Committee, said he would demand information from the Department of Health and Human Services about its “abject failure to ensure the safety of migrant children.”
Every major advocacy and service group that works with migrant children called this week for President Joe Biden to respond by giving the children immediate access to legal representation and case management to prevent them from falling into labor exploitation.
“The Biden administration must make right the protection system that failed unaccompanied children, and all children exploited for labor,” said Mario Bruzzone, senior policy adviser at the Women’s Refugee Commission. “We need accountability from the brands that profit from child labor, and every unaccompanied child must have a lawyer to safeguard the child’s rights.”
The Health and Human Services Department said Thursday that its staff would work with Congress to provide case management to all migrant children within the next two years, but currently most are still sent to sponsors with little but the phone number for a national hotline, which until Monday did not have a policy of calling children back.
A senior administration official said there may not be enough lawyers specialized in legal services for unaccompanied migrant children to provide universal representation.
Pressure is also building on the companies to eliminate child labor from their supply chains.
The Times reported that in Michigan, children make auto parts at companies that supply Ford and General Motors. One of the suppliers, the publicly traded company ABC Technologies, said in a statement that it took the issue seriously and was conducting an outside audit.
Sister Schubert’s Homemade Rolls, which is owned by the publicly traded company Lancaster Colony Corp., said it had been unaware children were working in its plant, but was now investigating. Walmart and Target, which sell the rolls, have said they are investigating as well.
Gaspar Morales, who worked for Sister Schubert’s until August, said he regularly saw children as young as 12 and 13 putting in 10-hour overnight shifts at the factory, and sometimes helped them get hired through a temp agency.
“I help everybody out. Some people don’t like young kids working, but I’ll give them a chance,” he said. He said he tried to keep children away from the industrial freezers.
Many of the children mentioned in the Times investigation were offered additional help this week. One of them, Carolina Yoc, had an appointment Friday to start the process of getting a work permit. The Health and Human Services Department had also reached out to offer case management. Her aunt said she hoped that other families could soon get similar support.

Biden's Cybersecurity Strategy Urges Stricter Mandates for Tech Companies: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The policy document urges more mandates on the firms that control most of the nation's digital infrastructure, and an expanded government role to disrupt hackers and state-sponsored entities.
WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration issued a new cybersecurity strategy on Thursday that calls on software makers and American industry to take far greater responsibility to assure that their systems cannot be hacked, while accelerating efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Defense Department to disrupt the activities of hackers and ransomware groups around the world.
For years, the government has pressed companies to voluntarily report intrusions in their systems and regularly patch their programs to fix newly discovered vulnerabilities, much as an iPhone does with automatic updates every few weeks.
But the new National Cybersecurity Strategy concludes that such good-faith efforts are helpful but insufficient in a world of constant attempts by sophisticated hackers, often backed by Russia, China, Iran or North Korea, to get into critical government and private networks. Instead, companies must be required to meet minimum cybersecurity standards, the new strategy contends.
The strategy is a policy document, not an executive order, although it represents a significant shift in attitude toward the "public-private partnerships" that the government has talked about for years. While some aspects of the new strategy are already in place, others would require legislative changes -- potentially a major challenge in a Republican-dominated Congress. And the federal government does not have the ability to impose cybersecurity requirements on state-run facilities like hospitals, which have been targeted by hackers.
"The fundamental recognition in the strategy is that a voluntary approach to securing" critical infrastructure and networks "is inadequate," Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, said at an event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
Every administration since that of George W. Bush, 20 years ago, has issued a cybersecurity strategy of some kind, usually once in a presidency. But President Biden's differs from previous versions in several respects, chiefly by urging far greater mandates on private industry, which controls the vast majority of the nation's digital infrastructure, and by expanding the role of the government to take offensive action to pre-empt cyberattacks, especially from abroad.
The Biden administration's strategy envisions what it calls "fundamental changes to the underlying dynamics of the digital ecosystem." If enacted into new regulations and laws, it would force companies to implement minimum cybersecurity measures for critical infrastructure -- and, perhaps, impose liability on firms that fail to secure their code, much like automakers and their suppliers are held liable for faulty airbags or defective brakes.
"It just reimagines the American cybersocial contract," said Kemba Walden, the acting national cyber director, a White House post created by Congress two years ago. "We are expecting more from those owners and operators in our critical infrastructure," added Ms. Walden, who took over last month after the country's first cyber director, Chris Inglis, a former deputy director of the National Security Agency, resigned.
The government also has a heightened responsibility, she added, to shore up defenses and disrupt the major hacking groups that have locked up hospital records or frozen the operations of meatpackers around the country, along with government operations in Baltimore, Atlanta and small towns across Texas.
"We have a duty to do that," Ms. Walden said, "because the internet is now a global commons, essentially. So we expect more from our partners in the private sector and the nonprofits and industry, but we also expect more of ourselves."
Read alongside the cybersecurity strategies issued by the previous three presidents, the new document reflects how offense and defense in the sphere have become increasingly central to national security policy.
The Bush administration never publicly acknowledged American cyberattack capabilities, even as it mounted the most sophisticated cyberattack one state has ever directed at another: a covert effort to use code to sabotage Iran's nuclear fuel facilities. The Obama administration was reluctant to name Russia and China as the powers behind major hacks of the U.S. government.
The Trump administration bolstered American offensive initiatives against hackers and state-backed actors abroad. It also raised the alarm about having Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant it accused of being an arm of the Chinese government, set up high-speed 5G networks in the United States and among allies, fearing that the company's control of such networks would aid in Chinese surveillance or allow Beijing to shut down systems at a time of conflict.
But the Trump administration was less active in requiring American companies to establish minimum protections on critical infrastructure, or seeking to make those firms liable for damage if vulnerabilities they had left unaddressed were exploited.
Imposing new forms of liability would require major legislative changes, and some White House officials acknowledged that Mr. Biden could face insurmountable opposition from Republicans in Congress if he sought to pass such sweeping new corporate regulations.
The Biden administration's move to establish corporate liability for failure to meet basic security needs "will have decades-long ramifications," said Glenn S. Gerstell, a former general counsel at the National Security Agency.
"In the cyberworld, we're finally saying that Ford is responsible for Pintos that burst into flames, because they didn't spend money on safety," he added, referring to the famously combustible car that was recalled in 1978.
Many elements of the new strategy are already in place. In some ways, it is catching up with steps the Biden administration took after struggling through its first year, which began with major hacks of systems used by both private industry and the military.
After a Russian ransomware group shut down the operations of Colonial Pipeline, which handles much of the gasoline and jet fuel along the East Coast, the Biden administration used little-known legal authorities held by the Transportation Security Administration to regulate the nation's vast network of energy pipelines. Pipeline owners and operators are now required to submit to far-reaching standards set largely by the federal government, and later this week, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to do the same for water pipelines.
There are no parallel federal authorities for requiring minimum standards of cybersecurity at hospitals, which are largely regulated by states. Health centers have been another target of attacks, from Vermont to Florida.
"We should have been doing many of these things years ago after cyberattacks were first used to disrupt power to thousands of people in Ukraine," Ms. Neuberger said in an interview on Wednesday. She was referring to a series of attacks on the Ukrainian power grid that began seven years ago.
Now, she said, "we are literally cobbling together an approach sector by sector that covers critical infrastructure."
Ms. Neuberger cited Ukraine as an example of a proactive cyberdefense strategy: In the weeks after the Russian invasion, Ukraine changed its laws to allow ministries to move their databases and many government operations to the cloud, backing up computer servers and data centers around Kyiv and other cities that were later targets for Russian artillery. Within weeks, many of those server farms were destroyed, but the government kept running, communicating to servers abroad using satellite systems like Starlink, also brought in after the war broke out.
The U.S. strategy is catching up with its offensive program, which has become increasingly aggressive. Two years ago, the F.B.I. began to use search warrants to find and dismantle fragments of malicious code found on corporate networks. More recently, it hacked into the networks of a ransomware group, removed the "decryption keys" that would unlock documents and systems belonging to the group's victims and foiled efforts to collect large ransoms.
The F.B.I. can operate in domestic networks; it is up to U.S. Cyber Command to go after Russian hacking groups like Killnet, a pro-Moscow group responsible for a series of denial-of-service attacks starting in the early days of the war in Ukraine. Cyber Command also slowed the operations of Russian intelligence agencies around the 2018 and 2020 American elections.
But none of those are permanent solutions; some groups the United States has targeted have formulated themselves anew, often under different names.
Mr. Biden's only face-to-face meeting as president with Russia's leader, Vladimir V. Putin, in 2021 in Geneva, was driven largely by the fear that rising ransomware attacks were affecting the lives of consumers, hospital patients and factory workers. Mr. Biden warned the Russian leader that his government would be held responsible for attacks emanating from Russian territory.
There was a lull for a number of months, and a prominent hacking group was raided by Russian authorities in Moscow. But that cooperation ended with the opening of the war in Ukraine.
In a speech this week at Carnegie Mellon University, Jen Easterly, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, described the efforts of the administration as "shifting liability onto those entities that fail to live up to the duty of care they owe their customers."
"Consumers and businesses alike expect that products purchased from a reputable provider will work the way they are supposed to and not introduce inordinate risk," Ms. Easterly said. She added that the administration needed to "advance legislation to prevent technology manufacturers from disclaiming liability by contract," a common practice that few notice in the fine print of software purchases.

Searching for the Faces of Child Migrant Labor: [National Desk]

Full text: To investigate the exploitation of child migrants, who often work long hours at factory jobs, the reporter Hannah Dreier waited out the late shift in parking lots.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
It was snowing, the heater in my rental car had broken, and I felt somewhat shady as I studied the faces of workers leaving a factory at midnight in Grand Rapids, Mich., last fall.
I had come to the heart of the industrial Midwest because I thought I might find migrant children working dangerous jobs. As the late shift ended and people in hairnets began to emerge from the building, I saw that many of them were short and baby faced. But there was another problem: The workers didn't have coats and they were running through a November cold snap to find their car pools. I asked myself how I was going to talk to them without seeming like a stranger chasing children through the snow.
This was my last stop for a project that had led me to seven states and entailed interviews with more than 100 migrant children working exploitative jobs across the country.
In the last two years, more than 250,000 children have entered the United States by themselves, many of them from Central America. I found that thousands of them had ended up in punishing jobs that flouted child labor laws. Children as young as 12 and 13 year olds are working in commercial laundromats, industrial bakeries and sock mills.
I started my reporting back in the spring of 2022, shortly after I joined The Times. I mentioned to my editor, Kirsten Danis, that I had once come across a group of migrant children working in a cookie factory on Long Island. I never followed up on what I had seen, but Kirsten's surprise helped me see that there might be a larger story there.
My first step was to request a database of information about migrant children through the Freedom of Information Act. After the government was slow to respond, The Times sued for these and other records. The data I eventually obtained revealed a trove of details about children who had come to this country since 2021, including where they were living and whether they had been reunited with their parents.
When minors cross the border alone, the government is supposed to release them to trustworthy adults. A decade ago, most children went to a parent already living in this country. But now a majority go to more distant relatives, acquaintances or even strangers because their parents are not in the United States. I saw that in northwest Grand Rapids, only 7 percent of migrant children were being released to parents. It was an immediate red flag.
One of my first stops when I got to the city was Union High School, which I learned had a thriving program for English-language learners. In a ninth-grade class, I saw three girls whispering with each other as their teacher played a movie. They told me they all worked overnight packing cereal into boxes. One of them added, "My uncle says that he's going to let me stop soon."
I felt terrible for these children. But I believed them, because I had spoken to so many young people leading similar lives at that point. I asked them about their schedules and the company they worked for. They said they always car-pooled to work with an adult, and had not paid attention to the specifics about their employer.
So I turned to a community organizer, who told me there was only one cereal factory in the city known for hiring children. It was called Hearthside Food Solutions, and it made and packaged food for larger companies. She connected me with a Hearthside worker who knew what brand the company was running on its assembly lines that night: Cheerios.
It is a clear violation of child labor laws for young teenagers to work with industrial machines, and I wondered if General Mills, which owns Cheerios, would really let such an iconic brand get mixed up with child labor. (In reviewing The Times's findings from my investigation, General Mills has said it recognizes "the seriousness of this situation." Hearthside said in a statement that it was "deeply concerned" and had prohibited its suppliers from hiring underage workers.) I needed to check the situation out. I killed time until the late shift ended, then drove to the factory and tried to avoid parking under the floodlights.
I had not expected to see any children exit the factory, but after a few minutes I saw a group of workers who not only looked underage, they looked exactly like the girls I had spoken to in class that afternoon. They waved to me in recognition as they walked by.
I made two more trips to Grand Rapids and eventually met and exchanged phone numbers with many more young workers. Later, I followed up with their adult sponsors in the United States and parents in Central America to make sure we had additional consent to have them featured in the article. I reviewed the children's legal documents to verify their ages, and looked at their company badges and paychecks to verify their jobs.
Like most teenagers, they were constantly documenting their lives, and several had taken photos and videos at the plants. I learned that inside, the factories were harshly lit and sounded like an airplane taking off.
On Sundays -- often their only day off -- they sacrificed catching up on sleep to talk with me. Children in this shadow work force rarely speak out. They tend to be wary of outsiders who ask questions about their ages and jobs. But families decided to go on the record because they felt it was important to show what life was really like for migrant children in the United States. Many children told me they wished they had known this themselves before heading north.
They had not anticipated policy changes in response to these stories, but two days after this investigation was published, the White House announced a series of immediate reforms at two agencies and launched a federal task force.
I checked in this week with one teenager who had been working in Grand Rapids making auto parts used by Ford and General Motors. (The companies said they took child labor violations at suppliers seriously and were investigating.) I caught him while he was driving. His company had fired all of the minors, he said. But there was still work at another plant nearby. Then he told me he had to go -- he had just arrived and his shift would be starting soon.

Full text: In his tender and gruff directorial debut, Michael B. Jordan again takes the lead, this time alongside Jonathan Majors as a childhood friend who has reappeared.
The tears flow as freely as the blood in "Creed III," the latest entry in the apparently indestructible "Rocky" saga. Once again, Adonis Creed -- the tough but tender, gruff but gentle heavyweight boxer played by Michael B. Jordan -- must be knocked down so that he can rise higher still. That story line is a metaphor for life, no doubt. It's also a perfect distillation of this franchise, which has had repeated ups and downs during its staggering 47-year run.
In 1976, the year that Sylvester Stallone's Rocky sprinted up the long steps leading to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Gerald R. Ford was president and most of the principal cast of "Creed III" wasn't yet born. The 2015 release of "Creed," seventh in the series, inaugurated a narrative shift that found Rocky taking on the role of the avuncular trainer, a part he also played three years later in the sequel. Stallone isn't in this latest chapter. While his absence has obvious resonance, if you were expecting some kind of Hamlet-style anguish or even a hint of misty melancholia about the now-absent symbolic father, forget it. This isn't the Sly Stallone show; it's Michael B. Jordan's, from first scene to last.
For this installment, Jordan has taken over as both the star and the director (it's his feature debut), twinned roles that he has assumed with seamless assurance. As entertaining as it is predictable, "Creed III" does exactly what you expect, delivering nicely balanced helpings of intimacy and spectacle, grit and glamour. It's enjoyably old-school Hollywood in how squarely it hits all the familiar genre beats -- even as it pragmatically advances the series -- yet it's also very much of the moment in how it grapples with family, friendship and the complexities of contemporary masculinity, its pleasures and its burdens.
Every boxer needs a challenger, a hard body to spar with physically and otherwise. Here, that foe is Damian, a childhood friend of Adonis (Donnie to his pals), a walking wound played as an adult by Jonathan Majors. (In flashback, Spence Moore II and Thaddeus James Mixson Jr. play the characters as adolescents.) After the usual recap -- now retired, Donnie is fabulously successful and settled down with his family -- Damian appears in a hoodie one day outside Donnie's gym while leaning on the champ's Rolls-Royce. It's an image that's more biting than any line of dialogue, all the more so because an irritated Donnie doesn't at first recognize Damian, a scene that Jordan invests with dramatic tension and visceral unease.
That sense of disquiet remains as an enigmatically wary Donnie and an unreadable Damian share a meal and guarded laughs, and the story's (too) many pieces begin sharply clicking into place. The movie is a continuation of Creed's story, and a further burnishing of a new big-screen myth -- one that is now refracted through Damian and his desire to get back into the ring. A Golden Gloves fighter as a teen, Damian wants to reclaim his boxing glory and resume a trajectory cut short by prison. That's exactly what happens, more or less, despite Donnie's reservations, the strong objections of his business partner, Tony (Wood Harris), and some complications with Donnie's mother, Mary-Anne (Phylicia Rashad).
Like many actors-turned-directors, Jordan does very fine work with the performers, including in his scenes with Tessa Thompson, who again plays Bianca, his lover and now wife. Her character doesn't have all that much to do (a musician, she has given up performing), but Thompson's charisma ensures that the character never registers like an afterthought or an appendage to the male protagonist. There's no question that Jordan is the star, as his ample screen time affirms -- the man certainly knows his best camera angles and when to strip down -- but what gives the movie interest and heft is how it insistently deploys other characters to complicate and recast the classic figure of the rugged American individual.

Like "Rocky" was for Stallone, the first "Creed" served as a breakthrough for Jordan and for its director, Ryan Coogler, who have become entertainment-world juggernauts. Stallone's presence in the earlier "Creed" movies ensured that the franchise remained tethered to his legacy, with its sequels and fraught semiotics, even if the titles no longer carried the Rocky name. Instructively, the first "Creed" ends with Donnie and Rocky side by side; the second restlessly cuts between the two, as if asking for you to choose between them. The choice has now been made, and with the shift from Rocky to Creed the franchise has moved to fertile new ground. (Coogler and Stallone remain attached to the series as producers; Coogler also shares the story credit with the screenwriters, his brother Keegan Coogler and Zach Baylin.)
"Nobody owes nobody nothing," Rocky says in the first film, a philosophical declaration from a white working-class striver who can seem alone even when he's with other people and whose self-reliance puts him on a continuum with other bootstrapping self-mythologizers. In "Creed III," Donnie has his share of lonely moments, too, but the story continually puts him into play with other people, including in tender scenes of him caring for his and Bianca's daughter (Mila Davis-Kent). In contrast to, say, those dead-mom movies in which men take over for absent mothers, Donnie shares parenting duties. He is responsible for -- and to -- other people and deeply connected to a community that, however anxiously, includes Damian, who isn't a combative stranger but an old friend, as well as a reminder of a fate escaped.
"Creed III" suffers from the customary franchise bloat, and the ending is rushed and underdeveloped. It's also bogged down by a tragic subplot that feels expedient (you can sense the next movie being plotted out as it unfolds), but that also gives Donnie a narrative rationale to shed copious tears, which Jordan does with aching vulnerability. There's art and craft in those tears. There is also, well, a creed. And as emotion floods this movie, Jordan lets loose a torrent of ideas about Black masculinity and community, about how the past haunts the present, the legacy of state violence, the chimera of self-reliance and the existential necessity of love. So, come for the boxing, yes -- but bring plenty of hankies, too.

New Biden Cybersecurity Strategy Assigns Responsibility to Tech Firms

Full text: Enlarge this image.
WASHINGTON — The Biden administration issued a new cybersecurity strategy Thursday that calls on software-makers and American industry to take far greater responsibility to assure that their systems cannot be hacked, while accelerating efforts by the FBI and the Defense Department to disrupt the activities of hackers and ransomware groups around the world.
For years, the government has pressed companies to voluntarily report intrusions in their systems and regularly “patch” their programs to fix newly discovered vulnerabilities, much as an iPhone does with automatic updates every few weeks.
But the new National Cybersecurity Strategy concludes that such good-faith efforts are helpful but insufficient in a world of constant attempts by sophisticated hackers, often backed by Russia, China, Iran or North Korea, to get into critical government and private networks. Instead, companies must be required to meet minimum cybersecurity standards, the new strategy contends.
The strategy is a policy document, not an executive order, although it represents a significant shift in attitude toward the “public-private partnerships” that the government has talked about for years. While some aspects of the new strategy are already in place, others would require legislative changes — potentially a major challenge in a Republican-dominated Congress. And the federal government does not have the ability to impose cybersecurity requirements on state-run facilities like hospitals, which have been targeted by hackers.
“The fundamental recognition in the strategy is that a voluntary approach to securing” critical infrastructure and networks “is inadequate,” Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, said at an event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
Every administration since that of George W. Bush, 20 years ago, has issued a cybersecurity strategy of some kind, usually once in a presidency. But President Joe Biden’s differs from previous versions in several respects, chiefly by urging far greater mandates on private industry, which controls the vast majority of the nation’s digital infrastructure, and by expanding the role of the government to take offensive action to preempt cyberattacks, especially from abroad.
The Biden administration’s strategy envisions what it calls “fundamental changes to the underlying dynamics of the digital ecosystem.” If enacted into new regulations and laws, it would force companies to enact minimum cybersecurity measures for critical infrastructure — and, perhaps, impose liability on firms that fail to secure their code, much like automakers and their suppliers are held liable for faulty air bags or defective brakes.
“It just re-imagines the American cybersocial contract,” said Kemba Walden, the acting national cyber director, a White House post created by Congress two years ago. “We are expecting more from those owners and operators in our critical infrastructure,” added Walden, who took over last month after the country’s first national cyber director, Chris Inglis, a former deputy director of the National Security Agency, resigned.
The government also has a heightened responsibility, she added, to shore up defenses and disrupt the major hacking groups that have locked up hospital records or frozen the operations of meatpackers around the country, along with government operations in Baltimore, Atlanta and small towns across Texas.
“We have a duty to do that,” Walden said, “because the internet is now a global commons, essentially. So we expect more from our partners in the private sector and the nonprofits and industry, but we also expect more of ourselves.”
Read alongside past cyberstrategies issued by the previous three presidents, the new document reflects how cyberoffense and -defense have become increasingly central to national security policy.
The Bush administration never publicly acknowledged U.S. offensive cybercapabilities, even as it mounted the most sophisticated cyberattack one state has ever directed at another: a covert effort to use code to sabotage Iran’s nuclear fuel facilities. The Obama administration was reluctant to name Russia and China as the powers behind major hacks of the U.S. government.
The Trump administration bolstered U.S. offensive initiatives against hackers and state-backed actors abroad. It also raised the alarm about having Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant it accused of being an arm of the Chinese government, set up high-speed 5G networks in the United States and among allies, fearing that the company’s control of such networks would aid in Chinese surveillance or allow Beijing to shut down systems at a time of conflict.
But the Trump administration was less active in requiring U.S. companies to establish minimum protections on critical infrastructure, or seeking to make those firms liable for damage if vulnerabilities they had left unaddressed were exploited.
Imposing new forms of liability would require major legislative changes, and some White House officials acknowledged that Biden could face insurmountable opposition from Republicans in Congress if he sought to pass such sweeping new corporate regulations.
The Biden administration’s move to establish corporate liability for failure to meet basic security needs “will have decadeslong ramifications,” said Glenn S. Gerstell, a former general counsel at the National Security Agency.
“In the cyberworld, we’re finally saying that Ford is responsible for Pintos that burst into flames, because they didn’t spend money on safety,” he added, referring to the famously combustible car that was recalled in 1978.
Many elements of the new strategy are already in place. In some ways, it is catching up with steps the Biden administration took after struggling through its first year, which began with major hacks of systems used by both private industry and the military.
After a Russian ransomware group shut down the operations of Colonial Pipeline, which handles much of the gasoline and jet fuel along the East Coast, the Biden administration used little-known legal authorities held by the Transportation Security Administration to regulate the nation’s vast network of energy pipelines. Pipeline owners and operators are now required to submit to far-reaching standards set largely by the federal government, and later this week, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to do the same for water pipelines.
There are no parallel federal authorities for requiring minimum standards of cybersecurity at hospitals, which are largely regulated by states. Health centers have been another target of attacks, from Vermont to Florida.
“We should have been doing many of these things years ago after cyberattacks were first used to disrupt power to thousands of people in Ukraine,” Neuberger, said Wednesday.
She was referring to a series of attacks on the Ukrainian power grid that began seven years ago.
Now, she said, “we are literally cobbling together an approach sector by sector that covers critical infrastructure.”
Neuberger cited Ukraine as an example of proactive cyberdefense strategy: In the weeks after the Russian invasion, Ukraine changed its laws to allow ministries to move their databases and many government operations to the cloud, backing up computer servers and data centers around Kyiv and other cities that were later targets for Russian artillery. Within weeks, many of those server farms were destroyed, but the government kept running, communicating to servers abroad using satellite systems such as Starlink, also brought in after the war broke out.
The strategy is also catching up with an offensive program that has become increasingly aggressive. Two years ago, the FBI began to use search warrants to find and dismantle fragments of malicious code found on corporate networks. More recently, it hacked into the networks of a ransomware group, removed the “decryption keys” that would unlock documents and systems belonging to the group’s victims and foiled efforts to collect large ransoms.
The FBI can operate in domestic networks; it is up to the U.S. Cyber Command to go after Russian hacking groups such as Killnet, a pro-Moscow group responsible for a series of denial-of-service attacks starting in the early days of the war in Ukraine. The Cyber Command also slowed the operations of Russian intelligence agencies around the 2018 and 2020 U.S. elections.
But none of those are permanent solutions; some groups the United States has targeted have formulated themselves anew, often under different names.
Biden’s only face-to-face meeting as president with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, in 2021 in Geneva, was driven largely by the fear that rising ransomware attacks were affecting the lives of consumers, hospital patients and factory workers. Biden warned the Russian leader that his government would be held responsible for attacks emanating from Russian territory.
There was a lull for a number of months, and a prominent hacking group was raided by Russian authorities in Moscow. But that cooperation ended with the opening of the war in Ukraine.
In a speech this week at Carnegie Mellon University, Jen Easterly, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, described the efforts of the administration as “shifting liability onto those entities that fail to live up to the duty of care they owe their customers.”
“Consumers and businesses alike expect that products purchased from a reputable provider will work the way they are supposed to and not introduce inordinate risk,” Easterly said. She added that the administration needed to “advance legislation to prevent technology manufacturers from disclaiming liability by contract,” a common practice that few notice in the fine print of software purchases.

Shutting Down As a Means Of Standing Up: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Several Black playwrights have canceled productions of their works, in some cases after performances started, because of concerns about conditions at the theaters presenting them.
In Ohio, the playwright Charly Evon Simpson scuttled last month's planned Cleveland Play House production of her latest work, "I'm Back Now," after the director said that the theater had mishandled an actor's report that she was sexually assaulted at the building where the theater housed artists.
In Chicago, Erika Dickerson-Despenza forced Victory Gardens Theater to stop its production of "cullud wattah," her Flint water crisis-prompted family drama, in the middle of its run last summer to protest actions that included the ouster of the theater's artistic director.
And in Los Angeles, Dominique Morisseau shut down a Geffen Playhouse production of her play "Paradise Blue" a week after its opening in late 2021, saying that Black women who worked on the show had been "verbally abused and diminished."
The steps by playwrights to halt productions of their own work reflects concerns by Black artists frustrated by what they see as a failure of theater administrators to live up to the lofty promises made during and after the spring of 2020, when George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police prompted nationwide protests and calls for change in many corners of American society, including the arts. In theater, an anonymously-led coalition of artists, known by the title of its first statement, "We See You, White American Theater," circulated a widely read set of demands for change.
"We don't want to be pulling our plays -- we are playwrights, we want our plays to be done, we are walking away from money, and we are walking away from seeing our work onstage," Morisseau said. "But this is not an ego act and it is not a diva act. What we are doing is standing up when no one else will."
The cancellations have come just as theaters have been trying to reopen and rebuild following the lengthy pandemic shutdown.
There has been notable change to address concerns about diversity and representation: An increase in the number of plays by Black writers staged on Broadway and beyond; a wave of appointments of administrators of color to high-level theater industry positions; the renaming of two Broadway houses after Black performers (James Earl Jones and Lena Horne).
But the cancellations reflect recurrent concern about conditions in the industry. There is pain all around -- although actors are often still paid, the playwrights can lose fees and the theaters lose box office revenue and sunk production costs. And there are reputational risks: Will theaters still want to hire these artists? Will artists still want to work at these theaters?
"It's damaging to the theaters, it's damaging to the playwrights, and it's damaging to all the artists involved, but it puts a spotlight on issues that need a spotlight, and I hope it's catching the field's attention and reminding us that we haven't solved all the problems," said Sheldon Epps, a senior artistic adviser at Ford's Theater in Washington, the former artistic director of the Pasadena Playhouse, and the author of a new memoir, "My Own Directions: A Black Man's Journey in the American Theater." "We had all those conversations and all those conference calls, and the talk was valuable but clearly a lot more action is needed."
These cancellations began in October of 2021, when Jeremy O. Harris posted on Twitter an email he had sent to the Center Theater Group of Los Angeles, saying he wanted to "begin the process" of canceling that theater's production of "Slave Play," his acclaimed drama about interracial relationships. The Los Angeles production was to be the first since a pair of buzzy Broadway runs, but Harris was upset that the theater had announced a season with just one work by a woman.
The reaction was immediate. The company apologized publicly, and within a week had pledged that the following season at its Mark Taper Forum would feature only work by women or nonbinary playwrights. Harris then allowed "Slave Play" to proceed; the production became the best-selling show at the Taper since the pandemic shutdown.
"We have nothing to lose by telling a theater that we don't want to be their mascots any longer," Harris said.
"Here's the thing: writing a play is an act of community service, and even in pulling the play you are doing an act of community service -- that is theater as well, because the conversation that gets sparked is similar to the conversation sparked by doing the play," he added. "The only cost is to the ego of theater administrators who have dropped the ball in upholding the politics of the playwrights they've programmed."
Harris ultimately praised the Center Theater Group for its responsiveness, and Meghan Pressman, the theater's managing director and chief executive, said she was "grateful" for Harris's confrontation, even though it was difficult.
"We're being called to task, and we learned a lot," she said.
Morisseau was next, pulling the rights for "Paradise Blue" from the Geffen. The precipitating incident has never been made public, but Morisseau said at the time that "Harm happened internally within the creative team, when fellow artists were allowed to behave disrespectfully." The Geffen apologized, saying, "an incident between members of the production was brought to our attention and we did not respond decisively in addressing it."
In an interview, Morisseau said she considered pulling her play a last resort."I felt there was nothing else for me to do," she said.
And why have there been several cancellations in recent months? "I think what you're seeing is a failure of institutions and institutional leadership to take seriously the harms against Black women," Morisseau said. "It's nothing new to us, but it is very disappointing to experience it in a theater ecosystem that we all seek to be better. You can't welcome us and our stories, and not welcome the people who tell our stories and the bodies on whom our stories are told."
Playwrights, unlike screenwriters, have enormous power over the use of their work, sometimes by virtue of their contracts, and sometimes by virtue of the nature of their relationships with regional theaters.
Prepandemic, there were occasional instances of playwrights exercising such rights for a variety of reasons. In 2016, Penelope Skinner withdrew a Chicago theater's right to stage her dark comedy, "The Village Bike," after a news report detailed allegations that the theater's leader had mistreated performers; in 2012, Bruce Norris withdrew a German theater's right to stage his Pulitzer Prize-winning race-relations satire, "Clybourne Park," because he was angry about plans to cast a white actor to play a Black character; and in the 1980s, several playwrights canceled productions because of a union dispute.
"We encourage authors to exercise all of their contractual rights to the extent possible," said Ralph Sevush, the executive director of business affairs at the Dramatists Guild of America, an association representing playwrights.
For the affected theaters, the cancellations have been disruptive -- in each case, tickets had already been sold. Victory Gardens, which was already imploding when "cullud wattah" was pulled, has since stopped producing shows; the Cleveland Play House and Geffen Playhouse both issued apologies.
"Cleveland Play House acknowledges there were missteps in efforts to respond to a sexual assault," that organization said in a statement last month.
The financial implications vary from case to case. Morisseau said that, when "Paradise Blue" was canceled, "Every artist got paid through their contracts. I, as the writer, and the Geffen, as the institution, are the only ones who took any financial hit." David Levy, a spokesman for the labor union Actors' Equity Association, said that "Every Equity agreement anticipates worst case scenarios in which a production is canceled before the full run of the show is completed. When that happens, the union does our part to enforce the contract so that actors and stage managers are taken care of." In Cleveland, the union filed grievances that led to payment to its members for the canceled show there.
The current round of cancellations is directly tied to the racial reckoning that has roiled theaters over the last three years; there have been a wide array of calls for change, from term limits for industry leaders and more diverse creative teams sought by the We See You petitions, to the renaming of theaters and the use of racial sensitivity coaches won in a pact negotiated by the organization Black Theater United.
Black artists have cited the issues that propelled those movements in describing their current concerns. In Chicago, Dickerson-Despenza pulled the rights to her play after the dismissal of the theater's artistic director, Ken-Matt Martin, who was one of three Black leaders in top positions at Victory Gardens. At the time Dickerson-Despenza decried the "white supremacist capitalist patriarchal values" of the board. On Wednesday, the board issued a statement saying, "Victory Gardens Theater vehemently disagrees with the characterization," noting that it had had a diverse staff and board, and adding that "it is our hope that, rather than jumping to conclusions and casting aspersions, we can all move forward with a shared goal of having a vibrant and inclusive theater community for all."
Stori Ayers, who directed both the canceled production of "I'm Back Now" in Cleveland and the canceled production of "Paradise Blue" in Los Angeles, used similar language in an Instagram post about the two experiences, citing "white supremacy theater making culture." Both of those theaters declined to comment beyond their written statements.
Simpson, the playwright who pulled the rights for "I'm Back Now" from the Cleveland Play House, said she had decided to take that step after Ayers withdrew from the production over the theater's response to an actor who said she had been sexually assaulted in an elevator at the theater's artist housing.
"To put it simply: if the health, safety and well-being of people working on my play is in question, then there's no reason for the play to happen," Simpson said. "I could no longer trust that the theater was going to take care of the people putting on my show."
Simpson said she's not sure what will happen next with "I'm Back Now," because it was commissioned by the Cleveland Play House, and this was to be its first production. The play is about three generations of Cleveland residents, including a historical figure named Sara Lucy Bagby, who was the last person forced to return to slavery under the Fugitive Slave Act.
"You want the production, and you want to make it possible, and many of us are taught to be so grateful for that and to ignore things that may bother us," Simpson said. "I didn't ever imagine having to pull the rights."

Harris threatened to pull his "Slave Play," starring Antoinette Crowe-Legacy, far left, and Paul Alexander Nolan, from a Los Angeles theater to protest its dearth of works by women. The theater agreed to stage more works by women, and the play went on. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY CRAIG SCHWARTZ; LIZ LAUREN) (C6) This article appeared in print on page C1, C6.

Full text: A sprawling new program for the semiconductor industry is foremost about national security, but it will try to advance other priorities as well.
The Biden administration unveiled rules Tuesday for its "Chips for America" program to build up semiconductor research and manufacturing in the United States, beginning a new rush toward federal funding in the sector.
The Commerce Department has $ 50 billion to hand out in the form of direct funding, federal loans and loan guarantees. It is one of the largest federal investments in a single industry in decades and highlights deepening concern in Washington about America's dependence on foreign chips.
Given the huge cost of building highly advanced semiconductor facilities, the funding could go fast, and competition for the money has been intense.
Here's a look at the CHIPS and Science Act, what it aims to do and how it will work.
Funding chip production and research
The largest portion of the money-- $ 39 billion -- will go to fund the construction of new and expanded manufacturing facilities. Another $ 11 billion will be distributed later this year to support research into new chip technologies.
The bulk of the manufacturing money is likely to go to a few companies that produce the world's most advanced semiconductors -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung Electronics, Micron Technology and, perhaps in the future, Intel -- to help them build U.S. facilities.
Some will go to makers of older chips that are still essential for cars, appliances and weapons, as well as suppliers of raw materials for the industry and companies that package the chips into their final products.
While some critics have questioned the wisdom of giving grants to a profitable industry, semiconductor executives argue that they have little incentive to invest in the United States, given the higher costs of workers and running a factory.
The administration does not plan to fund entire projects: Biden administration officials say they plan to offer grants of between 5 to 15 percent of a company's capital expenditures for a project, with funding not expected to exceed 35 percent of the cost. Companies can also apply for a tax credit reimbursing them for 25 percent of project construction.
Limiting foreign dependence
Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, describes the program as foremost a national security initiative.
While the United States is still a leader in designing chips, most manufacturing has been sent offshore. Today, more than 90 percent of the most technologically advanced chips, which are critical for the U.S. military and the economy, are produced in Taiwan. That has prompted concerns about the supply's vulnerability, given China's aggression toward Taiwan and the potential for a military invasion of the island.
At the same time, China has increased its market share in less advanced chips that are still critical for cars, electronics and other products. The United States manufactures 12 percent of chips, though none of the world's most advanced.
Chip shortages during the pandemic forced factories to halt work and brought home in a tangible way how vulnerable the supply chain is to disruption. Workers at Ford Motor factories in Michigan and Indiana worked a full week just three times last year because of a chips shortage, Ms. Raimondo said in a speech at Georgetown University last week. That helped create a car shortage and raise the price of cars, stoking inflation.
The Commerce Department says the program will also provide the Department of Defense and the national security community with a domestic source of the world's most advanced chips.
Building chip hubs
According to Ms. Raimondo, the goal is to build at least two U.S. manufacturing clusters to produce the most advanced types of logic chips, as well as facilities for other kinds of chips, and complex supply networks to support them.
Commerce officials have declined to speculate where these facilities might be, saying they must review applications. But chip makers have already announced billions of dollars in plans for new investments around the United States.
TSMC, which produces most of the world's leading-edge chips, has been busy expanding in Arizona, while No. 2 Samsung is growing in Texas. Micron, which makes advanced memory chips, has announced big expansion plans in New York. And Intel, a U.S. technology giant that is investing heavily to try to capture a technological edge, has broken ground on a "megasite" in Ohio.
Ms. Raimondo has said the vision is to restore the United States to a position of leadership in semiconductor technology, to the point where every major global chip company wants to have both research and manufacturing facilities in the United States.
Still, there is skepticism about how much the program can do. One 2020 study, for example, found that a $ 50 billion investment in the industry would increase U.S. market share only to 14 percent.
Protecting taxpayer funds
The stakes are high for the Biden administration to prove this foray into industrial policy can work. Critics have argued that the federal government may not be the best judge of winners and losers. If the administration gets it wrong, it could face intense criticism.
The Commerce Department said it would look closely at companies that applied for funding, to try to ensure that they were not being given more taxpayer dollars than they needed.
In a decision that may irk some companies, the department said projects receiving grants would be required to share a portion of any unanticipated profits with the federal government, to ensure that companies gave accurate financial projections and didn't exaggerate costs to get bigger awards.
The Commerce Department also said it would dole out funding over time as companies hit project milestones, and give preference to those that pledged to refrain from stock buybacks, which tend to enrich shareholders and corporate executives by increasing a company's share price.
Companies are also barred from making new, high-tech investments in China or other "countries of concern" for at least a decade, to try to ensure that taxpayer money does not go to fund new operations in China.
But analysts said it remained to be seen how difficult it would be to enforce these provisions. Company finances can be opaque, and when a company saves a dollar in the United States, it may then choose to invest it elsewhere.
Helping workers by attaching big strings
The program also includes some ambitious and unusual requirements aimed at benefiting the people who will staff semiconductor facilities.
For one, the department will require companies seeking awards of $ 150 million or more to guarantee affordable, high-quality child care for plant construction workers and operators. This could include building company child care centers near construction sites or new plants, paying local child care providers to add capacity at an affordable cost or directly subsidizing workers' care costs. Ms. Raimondo has said child care will draw more people into the work force, when many businesses are struggling in a tight labor market.
Applicants are also required to detail their engagement with labor unions, schools and work force education programs, with preference given to projects that benefit communities and workers.
Other provisions will encourage companies, universities and other parties to offer more training for workers, both in advanced sciences and in skills like welding. The department said it would give preference to projects for which state and local governments were providing incentives with "spillover" benefits for communities, like work force training, education investment or infrastructure construction.
This is part of the Biden administration's "worker-centered" approach to economic policy, which seeks to use the might of the federal government to benefit workers. But some critics say it could put the program's goal of building the most advanced semiconductor factories at risk, if it adds excessive costs to new projects.

U.S. Announces a Crackdown on Migrant Child Labor: [National Desk]

Full text: The move came days after a Times investigation showed children were working in dangerous jobs throughout the United States.
The Biden administration on Monday announced a wide crackdown on the labor exploitation of migrant children around the United States, including more aggressive investigations of companies benefiting from their work.
The development came days after The New York Times published an investigation into the explosive growth of migrant child labor throughout the United States. Children, who have been crossing the southern border without their parents in record numbers, are ending up in punishing jobs that flout child labor laws, The Times found.
The White House laid out a host of new initiatives to investigate child labor violations among employers and improve the basic support that migrant children receive when they are released to sponsors in the United States. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, called the revelations in The Times "heartbreaking" and "completely unacceptable."
As part of the new effort, the Department of Labor, which enforces these laws, said it would target not just the factories and suppliers that illegally employ children, but also the larger companies that have child labor in their supply chains. Migrant children often use false identification and find jobs through staffing agencies that do not verify their Social Security numbers.
Companies have escaped fines in the past by blaming those agencies or other subcontractors when violations are discovered.
"Too frequently, employers who contract for services are not vigilant about who is working in their facilities," the Labor Department said in a statement.
The department will also explore using a "hot goods" legal provision that allows it to stop the interstate transport of goods when child labor has been found in the supply chain.
The Times found products made with child labor in the American supply chains of major brands and retailers, including Ben & Jerry's, Fruit of the Loom, Ford, General Motors, J. Crew, Walmart, Whole Foods and Target. In Grand Rapids, Mich., children worked late nights at plants operated by Hearthside Food Solutions, which makes and packages food for other companies, including General Mills, Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats.
The Department of Labor has begun an investigation into Hearthside, administration officials said.
Officials plan to initiate investigations in parts of the country more likely to have child labor violations and ask Congress to increase penalties. Federal investigators have long complained that the maximum fine for violations -- about $ 15,000 per occurrence -- is not enough to deter child labor. The new effort also establishes a joint task force between the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for child migrants, to better share information.
In the past two years, more than 250,000 children have come into the country alone. Many of them are under tremendous pressure to send money back to their parents, as well as pay thousands of dollars in smuggling fees and, in some cases, rent and living expenses to their sponsors. Most are from Central America, where economic conditions have deteriorated since the pandemic.
Children now are working hazardous jobs in every state and across industries, The Times found. They are taking jobs in slaughterhouses, construction sites and commercial bakeries -- positions that have long been off-limits to American children for nearly a century.
At least a dozen underage migrant workers have been killed on the job since 2017, including a 16-year-old who fell from and was crushed by an earthmover he was driving in Georgia. Others have been seriously injured, losing legs and shattering their backs in falls.
In a speech on the House floor Monday, Representative Hillary Scholten, Democrat of Michigan, called on Congress to act.
"Stories of kids dropping out of school, collapsing from exhaustion, and even losing limbs to machinery are what one expects to find in a Charles Dickens or Upton Sinclair novel, but not an account of everyday life in 2023, not in the United States of America," Ms. Scholten said.
A spokesman for Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Xavier Becerra, the secretary of health and human services, "cut corners on vetting procedures to prioritize the expedited release of minors, and as a result more migrant children are being handed off to traffickers and exploited."
Republicans on Capitol Hill immediately began launching investigations and discussing legislation, including plans to demand the Department of Health and Human Services to track and provide better care for children after they are released to sponsors. Democrats are also considering new measures.
Both the House Judiciary and Oversight committees pledged investigations, and Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and the Judiciary chairman, demanded in a letter sent Monday that Robin Dunn Marcos, the director of the division of H.H.S. in charge of child migrants, submit to a transcribed interview.
One Hearthside worker, Carolina Yoc, 15, described a grueling schedule of juggling school and eight-hour swing shifts packaging Cheerios each day. She said she was growing sick from the intensity of the factory work and lack of sleep.
A representative for Hearthside said last week that it had found workers through a staffing company and would implement better controls. After The Times's story was published, the company said it had hired a law firm and consultant to review its employment and safety practices and begun requiring government identification from any worker entering its 39 plants nationwide.
Most of the companies identified by The Times as having child labor in their supply chains said last week they were investigating the findings or had ended contracts with suppliers. PepsiCo, which owns Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats, whose brands are sometimes manufactured at Hearthside, did not respond to repeated requests for comment until after the Biden administration's announcement on Monday, when it said in a statement that it was "deeply concerned" and had prohibited its suppliers from hiring underage workers. Whole Foods, which also did not comment until after the story was published, said it would investigate The Times's findings of child migrant labor at one of the company's chicken suppliers.
Under a 2008 federal anti-trafficking law, children arriving alone from countries other than Canada and Mexico are allowed to stay in the United States and apply for asylum or other legal protections. The Department of Health and Human Services is supposed to ensure sponsors will support them and protect them from trafficking or exploitation.
But as more and more minors have crossed the border, the Biden administration has ramped up demand on H.H.S. staff members to release the children from shelters as quickly as possible. Mr. Becerra has urged staff members to move with the speed of an assembly line, The Times found. The department rolled back protections that had been in place for years, including some background checks and reviews of children's files.
A spokeswoman for the department said last week that it was in the best interest of children to be quickly moved out of detention and that the department had not compromised safety.
Once children are released, they have few options for additional help. Most leave shelters with little but the phone number for a national hotline run by H.H.S. The Times found that children were calling the hotline to report labor exploitation and hearing nothing back. Operators were generally referring calls to local law enforcement and other agencies, who may not have followed up.
On Monday, senior administration officials said Health and Human Services would now direct operators to return calls to children and require them to explain what local law enforcement agency would be in touch.
After caseworkers told The Times that H.H.S. regularly ignored obvious signs of labor exploitation -- including adults who were sponsoring up to 20 children at a time -- the agency said Monday that it would spend a month investigating whether policies needed to be changed for people who sponsor multiple children.
Case managers will also start providing information to sponsors and recently released children about U.S. labor protections.

Conspiracy Theorizing Goes Off the Rails: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On Feb. 3 a train carrying hazardous materials derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. Some of the contents immediately caught fire. Three days later authorities released and burned off additional material from five tankers. These fires caused elevated levels of harmful chemicals in the local air, although the Environmental Protection Agency says that the pollution wasn't severe enough to cause long-term health damage.
Train derailments are actually fairly common, but you can see how this one might become a political issue. After all, the Obama administration tried to improve rail safety, for example by requiring superior modern brakes on high-hazard trains, and then the Trump administration reversed these regulations. As it happens, these regulations probably wouldn't have prevented the Ohio derailment, because they were too narrow to have covered this particular train. Still, the events in East Palestine would seem, on the face of it, to strengthen the progressive case for stronger regulation of industry and hurt the conservative case against regulation.
Instead, however, the right is on the attack, claiming that blame for the disaster in Ohio rests on the Biden administration, which it says doesn't care about or is even actively hostile to white people.
This is vile. It's also amazing. As far as I can tell, right-wing commentators have just invented a whole new class of conspiracy theory, one that doesn't even try to explain how the alleged conspiracy is supposed to work.
Conspiracy theories generally come in two forms: those that involve a small, powerful cabal and those that require that thousands of people be colluding to hide the truth.
Historically, theories about powerful cabals have often been tied to antisemitism, to the belief that the Elders of Zion and/or the Rothschilds were shaping history -- a view promoted by some actually powerful people, including Henry Ford. These days, however, the most prominent example is QAnon, with its claim that a secret ring of pedophiles controls the U.S. government. And at this point, of course, QAnon adherents hold significant power within the House Republican caucus.
The thing about secret-cabal theories is that while they're generally absurd, they're hard to definitively disprove. Is President Biden actually a shape-shifting alien lizard? The White House physician will tell you no, but how do you know that he isn't a lizard, too?
The other kind of conspiracy theory, by contrast, seems as if it would be easy to disprove, because thousands of people would have to be in on the plot, without a single one breaking ranks. A prime example, still highly influential on the right, is the assertion that climate change is a hoax. To believe that, you have to claim that thousands of scientists are colluding to falsify the evidence. But that hasn't stopped the belief that climate change isn't real from being widespread, maybe even dominant, on the U.S. political right.
The Big Lie about the "stolen" 2020 election would seem to fall into the same category, requiring malfeasance by election officials across the country. Yet a large majority of Republicans told pollsters that they didn't believe Biden actually won.
And there's a new conspiracy theory in town: the claim that the war in Ukraine isn't really happening, that it's some kind of fake. Who could possibly believe that all the reporting, all the film footage is concocted? Well, Donald Trump's first national security adviser is apparently now a Ukraine war truther, and I won't be surprised if we start to hear this from many people on the right.
But the conspiracy theorizing about the Ohio derailment takes it to a whole other level. When Tucker Carlson suggests that this happened because East Palestine is a rural white community, with another Fox News host going so far as to say that the Biden administration is "spilling toxic chemicals on poor white people," how is this even supposed to have worked? How did Biden officials engineer a derailment by a private-sector train company, running on privately owned track, which lobbied against stronger safety regulations?
The administration also hasn't stinted on disaster aid. Multiple federal agencies quickly arrived on the scene, and Ohio's Republican governor says of the federal response, "I don't have complaints ... we're getting the help that we need."
But never mind. Something bad happened to conservative white people, so surely woke progressives must have been responsible.
Given what we've learned about how Fox handled claims of a stolen election -- feeding the Big Lie in public while mocking it in private -- it's a good bet that the network and other right-wing commentators know perfectly well that their accusations about the derailment are junk. But they know their audience, and probably believe that it's good business to propound racist conspiracy theories even if they make no logical sense.
Of course, it does no good to appeal to the right's better nature. But let me make a plea to mainstream media: Please don't report on this as if there were an actual controversy about who's responsible for the East Palestine disaster.

Full text: Mr. Watson had founded the troubled digital-media start-up Ozy, which unraveled after The New York Times examined its business practices.
Carlos Watson, the founder of the troubled digital start-up Ozy Media, was arrested on Thursday and charged with multiple counts of fraud, punctuating one of the more precipitous falls in the annals of online journalism.
Mr. Watson, 53, "engaged in a scheme to defraud Ozy's potential investors, potential acquirers, lenders and potential lenders" by misrepresenting the company's audience numbers and financial results, prosecutors for the Eastern District of New York said in a court document dated Wednesday.
He was arrested by the F.B.I. at a hotel in Midtown Manhattan early Thursday morning and arraigned in federal court in Brooklyn on Thursday afternoon. In addition to the fraud charges, prosecutors also charged him with aggravated identity theft. He pleaded not guilty to all counts and was released after posting a $ 1 million bond.
Mr. Watson's arrest came the same month as Samir Rao, 36, Ozy's former chief operating officer, and Suzee Han, 29, Ozy's former chief of staff, pleaded guilty to fraud charges, according to court documents.
Shortly after Mr. Watson's arrest and the guilty pleas, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Ozy Media, Mr. Watson, Mr. Rao and Ms. Han with defrauding investors of about $ 50 million. Mr. Rao and Ms. Han have settled the S.E.C. civil case against them.
Ozy and Mr. Watson have been under heavy scrutiny since September 2021, when The New York Times reported that someone at the start-up had apparently impersonated a YouTube executive during a conference call with Goldman Sachs, which was considering an investment. On the call, the impersonator said that YouTube had a great working relationship with Ozy and that Ozy's videos were successful on the platform.
Within days of the report, Ozy said that it was shutting down. Federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission opened investigations into the company.
On Thursday, Breon Peace, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District, said in a statement that Mr. Watson was a "con man" who "ran Ozy as a criminal organization rather than as a reputable media company."
Lanny A. Breuer, Mr. Watson's lawyer, said that "we had been attempting to have an open and good faith dialogue with the government, and I just don't understand why the decision was made to arrest Carlos this morning given what we thought was our constructive dialogue."
Jason Weinstein and Ryan Poscablo, lawyers for Ozy Media and Mr. Watson, said that they were "extremely disappointed" by the government's actions and had been engaging with them "since December, and as recently as yesterday."
Mr. Rao did not respond to requests for comment. Ed Swanson and Miles Ehrlich, lawyers who represent Mr. Rao, said in a statement that he had "accepted full responsibility for his actions," adding, "He is deeply remorseful, apologetic to those affected, and committed to making amends for his actions while at Ozy Media."
Ozy Media was started in 2013 and backed financially by the German publishing giant Axel Springer, the Ford Foundation and the Emerson Collective, the organization founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, among others. It produced a website, videos posted to YouTube and podcasts that were aimed at young audiences. The company generated a mix of stories and videos that identified up-and-coming leaders and important social causes.
Prosecutors on Thursday painted a picture of a company that had struggled for years. In 2015, after raising $ 35 million from investors over three funding rounds, Ozy's digital advertising business "was not succeeding," according to the prosecutors' complaint. That spurred the company to start a live-events business called "Ozy Fest" and create television content.
But the live events and television businesses were expensive. By 2017, the company's cash was beginning to run out. Beginning in 2018, it took on high-interest loans to survive, at times paying tens of thousands of dollars a day in interest. Ozy soon took on more debt and pursued more money from investors, the complaint said.
To secure additional funding, Ozy misled investors about the company's financial performance, according to the complaint. In December 2018, Mr. Watson received updates that the company's final revenue for the year would be less than $ 11 million, the complaint said. But Mr. Watson and Mr. Rao told investors that Ozy had generated roughly double that amount in revenue that year, prosecutors said.
At the end of 2019, to help cover expenses and grow, Ozy sent a fake contract with a TV company to a bank to help secure a loan over the protests of the company's former chief financial officer, according to the complaint. When the former chief financial officer became aware of the fraud, she quit in protest. She was not identified by name in the complaint.
"This ... is illegal," the former chief financial officer wrote in an email to Mr. Watson, according to the complaint. "This is fraud. This is forging someone's signature with the intent of getting an advance from a publicly traded bank."
On Feb. 2, 2021, prosecutors said, Mr. Rao impersonated a media executive as part of an attempt to get a financial institution to invest up to $ 45 million in Ozy. Mr. Watson was in the room with Mr. Rao and texted him instructions about what he should and should not say on the call, which he did with a voice-altering app, prosecutors said. Prosecutors did not name the financial institution, though that is the date of the call with Goldman Sachs that was previously reported by The Times.
At one point, Ozy also discussed selling itself to a media company for up to $ 225 million in stock based on false financial data and a misleading description of its TV contracts, according to the complaint. As part of that deal, which fell through, Mr. Watson pushed for a $ 35 million cash payment for himself, Mr. Rao and others, the complaint said.
The S.E.C.'s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, seeks fines for the defendants. Mr. Rao has agreed to not serve as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for 10 years, the agency said. The S.E.C. is seeking a similar ban against Mr. Watson.
If Mr. Watson is convicted of the fraud charges, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison, with a maximum of 37 years.
Although Ozy announced it would shut down shortly after The Times report was published in 2021, Mr. Watson reversed course days later, telling NBC in an interview that he would restart the company.
In recent months, Mr. Watson intensified his comeback efforts. Ozy started publishing email newsletters again and advertised on its website the 2023 return of Ozy Fest, a music and ideas festival. Readers were asked to put their email addresses on the waiting list for the event, which was to be held in Miami.
Mr. Watson also made an appearance to promote recipients of an Ozy scholarship during a presentation for advertisers in February. He plugged Ozy Fest during his appearance, according to two people with knowledge of the presentation, and took the stage as speakers blared the drug-peddling anthem "Hustlin'."
Mr. Watson was still pitching Ozy to investors as well. This month, Mr. Watson reached out to an investor to raise additional funding for the start-up, according to a person with knowledge of the interaction.
In the court appearance on Thursday, a lawyer for Mr. Watson, Arlo Devlin-Brown, asked that Mr. Watson be allowed to maintain contact with Ozy employees and potential investors, arguing that a ban would be "draconian" and "a death sentence for the company that has been his life's work for many years." It was not clear how many people Ozy currently employs. It had about 75 employees in 2021.
"The company is essentially being forced to shut down," Mr. Devlin-Brown said.
Judge Cheryl L. Pollak asked, "How can we be guaranteed that the fraud isn't just going to continue?" She said that Mr. Watson could leave the court freely, but could not have contact with employees or investors until his lawyers and the prosecutors met again to agree on a list of approved names.

Jimmy Carter, 98, Opts for Hospice Care

WASHINGTON — Former President Jimmy Carter, who at 98 is the longest living president in American history, has decided to forgo further medical treatment and will enter hospice care at his home in Georgia, the Carter Center announced Saturday.
“After a series of short hospital stays, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention,” the center said in a statement posted on Twitter. “He has the full support of his family and his medical team. The Carter family asks for privacy during this time and is grateful for the concern shown by his many admirers.”
The center did not elaborate on what conditions had prompted the recent hospital visits or his decision to enter hospice care. Carter has survived a series of health crises in recent years, including a bout with the skin cancer melanoma, which spread to his liver and brain, as well as repeated falls.
Jason Carter, one of Carter’s grandchildren and chair of the Carter Center’s board of trustees, said he had seen the former president and first lady Friday.
“They are at peace and — as always — their home is full of love,” he wrote on Twitter.
Hospice is defined as care for terminally ill patients when the priority is not to provide further treatment but to reduce pain and discomfort toward the end of life. The former president lives with his wife, Rosalynn Carter, 95, in a modest ranch house that the couple built in Plains, Georgia, in 1961.
Jimmy Carter has defied illness and death for years, outlasting two presidents who followed him as well as his own vice president. He became the longest-living president in March 2019 when he passed former President George H.W. Bush, who died the previous November.
After Carter’s melanoma spread to his brain in 2015, he drew praise for announcing it publicly. Even as he underwent treatment, he continued to teach Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, as promised. Within months, he announced that he was cancer-free.
In 2019, Carter fell at least three times, at one point breaking a hip and at another requiring 14 stitches. Each time he bounced back, even showing up for a Habitat for Humanity homebuilding project shortly after one fall.
But he has slowly retreated from public life lately, making fewer and fewer appearances or statements. He could not attend President Joe Biden’s inauguration in January 2021, when former presidents traditionally convene, but Biden made a pilgrimage to Plains in April of that year to pay his respects, the first sitting president to visit Carter at his Georgia home.
In one of his last public acts, Carter filed a brief last year supporting an appeal by conservation groups seeking to overturn a court decision permitting a gravel road to be built through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He argued that the construction would undercut the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which he had signed into law. He was said to be working on that issue as recently as last month.
“My name is Jimmy Carter,” he wrote in that brief. “In my lifetime, I have been a farmer, a naval officer, a Sunday school teacher, an outdoorsman, a democracy activist, a builder, governor of Georgia and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. And from 1977 to 1981, I had the privilege of serving as the 39th president of the United States.”
Carter was a political sensation in his day, a new-generation Democrat who after a single term as governor of Georgia shocked the political world by beating a host of better-known rivals to capture his party’s presidential nomination in 1976, then ousting the incumbent Republican president, Gerald Ford, in the fall.
Over the course of four years in office, he sought to restore trust in government following the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal, ushering in reforms that were meant to transform politics. He negotiated the landmark Camp David Accords making peace between Israel and Egypt, an agreement that remains the foundation of Middle East relations.
But a sour economy and a 444-day hostage crisis in Iran in which 52 U.S. diplomats were held captive undercut his public support, and he lost his bid for reelection to former Gov. Ronald Reagan of California in 1980.
He spent his post-presidency, however, on a series of philanthropic causes around the world, like building houses for the poor, combating Guinea worm, promoting human rights in places of repression, monitoring elections and seeking to end conflicts. His work as a former president in many ways came to eclipse his time in the White House, eventually earning him the Nobel Peace Prize and rehabilitating his image in the eyes of many Americans.

Full text: At New York Fashion Week, it was clear that the sartorial signifiers of wealth and status were changing.
Ten o'clock in the morning in the middle of New York Fashion Week, and assorted ladies in cocktail finery and well-heeled pumps were filing politely into a ballroom in the Plaza Hotel. Overhead, the crystal chandeliers twinkled; underfoot the carpet was plush. It was Carolina Herrera time, and they were the Herrera crowd, poised to applaud the garden-party brocade ball gowns from the designer Wes Gordon: the bell-shaped frocks in ice cream-social stripes; the Empress Sisi gold-embroidered tastefulness of it all.
The gowns swished by in silk crepe de Chine and double-faced duchesse satin -- fabrics that were once de rigueur among the fund-raiser set when the Plaza was primarily a local haunt rather than a tourist destination but that had become, Mr. Gordon said backstage, almost an "endangered species."
He wasn't wrong.
The final show of the fashion season -- the marquee slot, because it's also the last word -- once went to such establishment names as Marc Jacobs and Tom Ford, who would close the week out in the grand environs of the Park Avenue Armory or Lincoln Center. This time around, it went to Luar, among the more celebrated of the city's emerging names, and was held in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.
Raul Lopez, the Dominican-American designer, called his collection "Calle Pero Elegante." Translation: "street, but elegant."
That meant camel coat-dresses with linebacker shoulders. Leather motorcycle jackets with jutting feathers and a fox fur (the real kind) that looped up into a Magdalene-like hood. It meant silver sequins and gangster pinstripes; puffers and bustles and white shirts; the elements of the imagined big time jumbled together and set to the tune of Foxy Brown's "B.K. Anthem."
The point, Mr. Lopez said after his show, is that fashion is a form of generational wealth-signaling anyone can access.
"For some white families," he said, "that means a pearl necklace. For people from the hood, it's fur. It's a sneaker. It's a chain." He's looking to create the uniform of a new high society. The realization isn't quite there. But it's coming.
Clothes, the artifacts of our identity, tell a story. And the story the clothes told this fashion week was one of redefinition: a change in the hierarchy of aspiration and wealth, the sartorial codes that signpost power and success. The geography of the city has been fracturing for a while now. The psychosocial tectonic plates are shifting.
Tory Burch, onetime muse of the Pierre-Park Avenue set, captured the moment perfectly in a show literally predicated on imbalance: purposefully "broken" heels, logos sliding off handbags, slithery satin dresses buttoned wrong-side 'round. The familiar rendered, subtly, wrong -- which made it seem very right, one of the ironies of fashion. It's not an accident that various cast members of "The White Lotus," the show about the alienation and soullessness of the extremely rich, have been the celebrity gets of the season.
Meghann Fahy, who played the not-so-dumb-blond trophy wife in the show, sat front row at Khaite, where the designer Catherine Holstein took a page from the Row's brand of hidden luxe. Instead of her usual sharp-shouldered cool-girl jackets and fringed cocktail frocks came floor-brushing pleated silks and tunic tops in monochrome shades with a monk-like mien, as well as some deep-pile shearlings.
Beatrice Grannò and Simona Tabasco, the actors who played the "White Lotus" prostitutes on the make, popped up at Michael Kors (along with Gloria Steinem and Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York), which turned out to be a celebration of 1970s power women and the decade when he got his start in flares and fringe, with a whole lotta leg and a tailored coat thrown on top. Mr. Kors has always imbued sportswear with the ineffable scent of expense, but that private-plane-to-Aspen approach is starting to take on a sepia tinge. And not just because he has a fondness for taupe.
"What does it mean to look rich?" Mr. Kors mused backstage. "It's different than it used to be. When we were doing the evening things this season, I said: 'You know what? People at night want to feel glamorous, absolutely. But are you wearing boots? Are you wearing a jumpsuit?' It's not the traditional look-at-me corseted gown with the train." He paused. "I think it's sort of the inside wink-wink club. You just know it when you see it."
Heron Preston offered a different idea. "I think it's an attitude," Mr. Preston said, after a show of his namesake brand that took the stuff of streetwear -- beat-up leathers and faded denim, basketball shorts, moto jerseys and chain mail -- and cut it into the shapes of Champagne society: corsets, trapeze jackets, slip dresses, all grounded by the quirkiness of big fake fur boots and shoes. (Furry shoes were a trend.)
It's the confidence to claim, as Mr. Preston did in calling his collection, that "Anything Goes." And then to use your clothes to assert your place in the room.
That's what connects his work to that of Mr. Lopez of Luar, and that of Ev Bravado and Téla D'Amore of Who Decides War, a brand predicated on elevating denim to the ultimate in precious materials: shredding it, embroidering it, embellishing it and painting it -- demonstrating its endless possibilities. This time they added woven strips of silk, like three-dimensional camouflage, to their jeans, and the occasional layer of silver lacquer. They branched out into floor-skimming leather skirts speckled with cathedral pockets; and otherwise took the everyday and rendered it collectible.
The show was held on the Lower East Side in a decaying synagogue-turned-art gallery, with a melting ice sculpture of the city taking wing in the center, surrounded by an audience of people wearing Who Decides War clothes, preening for each other and comparing outfits, like the members of a very exclusive club.
It's a striking moment when almost an entire guest list seems excited to appear in full branded plumage of a very specific kind (and a kind that looks as if it has been purchased, not just lent for the occasion). Indeed, it almost never happens.
Except -- and this is the most telling thing -- at Chanel.

A-List Crowd Devours a Coveted Delicacy: [Style Desk]

Full text: The Parisian restaurant known as the unofficial headquarters for the fashion set made its New York debut on a recent evening.
"Hey, can we smoke in here?" asked the actress Natasha Lyonne, 43, in a leopard print dress, holding a pack of cigarettes. She was standing inside the newly opened Caviar Kaspia on the Upper East Side, a sister restaurant to the original in Paris. On Friday, Lauren Santo Domingo, the socialite and co-founder of Moda Operandi, hosted a party there to kick off New York Fashion Week.
"Not when the mayor is here!" Ms. Santo Domingo, 46, responded.
"Come on, you're the owner!" Ms. Lyonne said, turning to Sarah Senbahar. Ms. Senbahar and her husband and property developer, Izak Senbahar, own The Mark Hotel in New York, which had partnered with Caviar Kaspia as part of the Parisian restaurant's global expansion.
The guest list of celebrities, fashionistas and the rich and powerful for the evening included Mayor Eric Adams, nattily dressed in a burgundy blazer ("It's one of my favorite colors. I like the wine-ish color," he said), who was chatting with Marie-Chantal, the Crown Princess of Greece and Princess of Denmark, and the fashion designer Tory Burch. The pop singer Lily Allen, the actor Justin Theroux and the former political aide Huma Abedin stood nearby. Generous dollops of Osetra caviar were served on twice-baked potatoes (the dish can cost anywhere from $ 95 to $ 540, depending on the type and amount of caviar), with the champagne and vodka freely flowing.
There is a permissive sensibility to the original Caviar Kaspia, located on Place de la Madeleine in Paris's 8th arrondissement. With its distinctive aquamarine table linens, Limoges porcelain and comfortable old-world décor, the restaurant is known as a watering hole where celebrities, designers and fashion editors gather during couture and ready-to-wear fashion weeks. Rihanna stayed up until close to 4 a.m. at the restaurant to discuss her first pregnancy (after her Super Bowl performance, we now know she is into her second) with Vogue last year. Jay-Z and Beyoncé are known to pop in when they're in town. Yves Saint Laurent, Virgil Abloh and Tom Ford were frequent patrons, to name just a few of the many designers who have favored the joint. Caviar Kaspia is so beloved that people are fond of nicking the eatery's turquoise blue ashtray as a memento (which can fetch close to $ 100 on eBay).
"I love it so much. It's truly a clubhouse where I always run into people, and I swear I always have a good time," said Mel Ottenberg, the editor in chief of Interview Magazine.
"We're a bit like a traveling circus," said Ms. Santo Domingo, referring to the fashion editors and other personalities to whom she's close, a clique that includes the socialite Derek Blasberg; Vogue's global contributing fashion editor at large, Gabriella Karefa-Johnson; W's editor in chief, Sara Moonves; WSJ. Magazine's editor in chief, Kristina O'Neill; and Vogue's creative editorial director, Mark Guiducci, among others -- all of whom were in attendance that evening at the restaurant's new Upper East Side location.
"During fashion week, Caviar Kaspia is like our cafeteria," she said.
In the last three years, Caviar Kaspia has aggressively expanded internationally, first opening in Dubai just two years ago, followed by new locations in São Paulo, Saint Tropez, London and Los Angeles. New York's Caviar Kaspia came into being after the lease for the clothing and accessory brand Zadig & Voltaire's location below The Mark Hotel expired at the end of 2021. Mr. Senbahar had observed how customers at his hotel enjoyed ordering caviar, and he was a longtime fan of the original restaurant. He approached Ramon Mac-Crohon, the chief executive of Caviar Kaspia, to see if he would be interested in a partnership.
"When Izak called me, I couldn't think of a better address," said Mr. Mac-Crohon, 48, who had previously experimented with a downtown pop-up in the city in 2016. They quickly brought in the French interior decorator Jacques Grange -- responsible for the lavish look of The Mark -- to do the décor. Though that Friday evening was the first night the restaurant was opening its doors, the space wasn't finished, and a section intended to be the bar was discreetly partitioned off with black curtains, forcing cocktails to be served outside, where the paparazzi lurked nearby.
Mr. Mac-Crohon said the party should be considered a "grand soft opening."
Caviar Kaspia was founded in 1927 by the Russian émigré Arcady Fixon, who arrived in Paris after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. By then, French society had acquired a taste for the rare delicacy, which Russians had been eating for over a century. Referred to as "black gold," caviar has long been prized by conquerors and kings, czars and emperors. According to Inga Saffron's book "Caviar: The Strange History and Uncertain Future of the World's Most Coveted Delicacy," Winston Churchill requested 25 pounds of it in 1941 when he dispatched Lord Beaverbrook as a state dignitary to discuss the war with Joseph Stalin. Caviar and champagne parties were so common in the 1920s in Paris that F. Scott Fitzgerald once complained that serving it was "the height of affectation."
Caviar Kaspia is now owned by Mr. Mac-Crohon's family, who also count the restaurant Maison de la Truffe among their properties.
Decades ago, wild caviar was once so rare it could command outrageous prices. Today -- because of overfishing that has led the sturgeons of the Caspian and Black Seas to be considered an endangered species -- wild beluga caviar is banned in the United States. But the rise of farmed caviar in the last two decades has made the delicacy more available and accessible than it once was, with caviar bars popping up across the nation as well as direct-to-consumer caviar companies offering the food at more affordable prices.
Mr. Mac-Crohon said Caviar Kaspia served only farmed caviar from the United States, Bulgaria and Italy.
Still, quantity is different from quality in the universe of Caviar Kaspia. "There's one question that I hate, which journalists often ask me, which is, is caviar getting democratized? And the answer is no," Mr. Mac-Crohon said. "There are still different levels of caviar. What is happening is that caviar now has become cool. Before, caviar was for very special occasions, only for Christmas, New Year's Eve or a birthday."
Nevertheless, the food's wider availability helps to explain why his restaurant has leaned into being more of a destination than a delicacy. Whether its arrival in New York City will be a success is to be determined. But with the Parisian pastry and tea shop Ladurée now in SoHo and the Upper East Side, and the members-only London Club, Casa Cruz, having recently opened an outpost on 61st Street, it's not difficult to imagine New Yorkers embracing this new establishment as a place to celebrate.
The mayor, who said he liked attending New York Fashion Week events because it "feeds the entire economy" -- he was hoping to make it to the Michael Kors show -- was adamant that "New York City is having a comeback."
By 11 p.m., Mr. Adams had left, but the party was still thrumming along, with a handful of guests gathered around a long banquette. More vodka had been brought out by the waiters. Bowls of ice, containing open tins of caviar, sat sweating on the tables, with Caviar Kaspia's mother-of-pearl spoons casually resting nearby (metal or plastic is known to oxidize the roe). The party was winding down. Soon, the fashion set would migrate to London for the next collection of shows.
Ms. Santo Domingo said she could imagine someone having a graduation party at Caviar Kaspia. Ms. Burch and Mr. Ottenberg both said they had enjoyed going to Caviar Kaspia in Paris with their parents.
Its appeal, however, may be much more simple: "It's cozy there," Ms. Burch, 56, said.
"For when you don't have time to fly to Paris," Mr. Senbahar, 64, said. "I just thought we could bring a little bit of Paris to New York."

Jimmy Carter, 98, Opts for Hospice Care

WASHINGTON — Former President Jimmy Carter, who at 98 is the longest living president in American history, has decided to forgo further medical treatment and will enter hospice care at his home in Georgia, the Carter Center announced Saturday.
“After a series of short hospital stays, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention,” the center said in a statement posted on Twitter. “He has the full support of his family and his medical team. The Carter family asks for privacy during this time and is grateful for the concern shown by his many admirers.”
The center did not elaborate on what conditions had prompted the recent hospital visits or his decision to enter hospice care. Carter has survived a series of health crises in recent years, including a bout with the skin cancer melanoma, which spread to his liver and brain, as well as repeated falls.
Jason Carter, one of Carter’s grandchildren and chair of the Carter Center’s board of trustees, said he had seen the former president and first lady Friday.
“They are at peace and — as always — their home is full of love,” he wrote on Twitter.
Hospice is defined as care for terminally ill patients when the priority is not to provide further treatment but to reduce pain and discomfort toward the end of life. The former president lives with his wife, Rosalynn Carter, 95, in a modest ranch house that the couple built in Plains, Georgia, in 1961.
Jimmy Carter has defied illness and death for years, outlasting two presidents who followed him as well as his own vice president. He became the longest-living president in March 2019 when he passed former President George H.W. Bush, who died the previous November.
After Carter’s melanoma spread to his brain in 2015, he drew praise for announcing it publicly. Even as he underwent treatment, he continued to teach Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, as promised. Within months, he announced that he was cancer-free.
In 2019, Carter fell at least three times, at one point breaking a hip and at another requiring 14 stitches. Each time he bounced back, even showing up for a Habitat for Humanity homebuilding project shortly after one fall.
But he has slowly retreated from public life lately, making fewer and fewer appearances or statements. He could not attend President Joe Biden’s inauguration in January 2021, when former presidents traditionally convene, but Biden made a pilgrimage to Plains in April of that year to pay his respects, the first sitting president to visit Carter at his Georgia home.
In one of his last public acts, Carter filed a brief last year supporting an appeal by conservation groups seeking to overturn a court decision permitting a gravel road to be built through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He argued that the construction would undercut the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which he had signed into law. He was said to be working on that issue as recently as last month.
“My name is Jimmy Carter,” he wrote in that brief. “In my lifetime, I have been a farmer, a naval officer, a Sunday school teacher, an outdoorsman, a democracy activist, a builder, governor of Georgia and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. And from 1977 to 1981, I had the privilege of serving as the 39th president of the United States.”
Carter was a political sensation in his day, a new-generation Democrat who after a single term as governor of Georgia shocked the political world by beating a host of better-known rivals to capture his party’s presidential nomination in 1976, then ousting the incumbent Republican president, Gerald Ford, in the fall.
Over the course of four years in office, he sought to restore trust in government following the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal, ushering in reforms that were meant to transform politics. He negotiated the landmark Camp David Accords making peace between Israel and Egypt, an agreement that remains the foundation of Middle East relations.
But a sour economy and a 444-day hostage crisis in Iran in which 52 U.S. diplomats were held captive undercut his public support, and he lost his bid for reelection to former Gov. Ronald Reagan of California in 1980.
He spent his post-presidency, however, on a series of philanthropic causes, like building houses for the poor, combating Guinea worm in Africa, promoting human rights in places of repression, monitoring elections in far-flung countries and seeking to end conflicts in disparate parts of the globe. His work as a former president in many ways came to eclipse his time in the White House, eventually earning him the Nobel Peace Prize and rehabilitating his image in the eyes of many Americans.

Tim McCarver, 81, All-Star Catcher and Hall of Fame Broadcaster, Dies: [Correction]

Full text: Twice an All-Star, he played on four teams over four decades and won two World Series titles. Then he took his baseball smarts and gift of gab into the TV booth.
Tim McCarver, a durable big-league catcher who played in four decades, made two All-Star teams and won two World Series championships, but whose greater renown derived from his career as a Hall of Fame broadcaster, died on Thursday in Memphis. He was 81.
His death was announced by the National Baseball Hall of Fame, which said the cause was heart failure.
Known for his shrewd analysis of strategy, his literate use of metaphor and his penchant for predicting what was about to unfold on the field, often correctly, McCarver was sometimes a play-by-play announcer but most often a color man, a role that better suited his gift of gab.
His career spanned more than 30 years, from his start in Philadelphia in 1980, to his famous pairing with the former slugger Ralph Kiner in the Mets' booth, to his national appearances on four different networks, to stints with the Yankees and the San Francisco Giants.
Throughout, his informed, perceptive and articulate observations of the game were widely admired, and his gravelly tenor with a hint of his Tennessee upbringing in it became one of the game's most familiar voices.
Like all long-serving talking heads, McCarver had his detractors. Some said he talked too much, belabored the obvious, too often tangled his grammar and was overly thrilled by his own cleverness; examples abounded on a now-defunct web page, shutuptimmccarver.com, and he was mocked on "Family Guy." The Atlanta Braves outfielder Deion Sanders once took exception to a McCarver criticism and dumped a bucket of ice water over his head in the locker room after a game.
But more numerous were those who appreciated his independence of mind and his alertness to situational nuances in the game.
In defiance of a broadcasting norm, McCarver was not averse to criticizing the play of a team that employed him; when he was fired from the Mets job in 1999, after 16 seasons, it was reportedly because of just such candor. And his forthrightness often came with a flash of wit or wordplay. In a game in 1992, after watching the Mets' David Cone strike out Casey Candaele (pronounced can-DELL) of the Houston Astros on three pitches, McCarver quipped, "Looks like Cone burned the Candaele at both ends."
A Ninth-Inning Call
Perhaps his most famous moment as a broadcaster came in the final seconds of the 2001 World Series. In the bottom of the ninth inning of the seventh game, with the score tied, one out and the bases loaded, the Arizona Diamondbacks' Luis Gonzalez, a left-handed hitter, faced Mariano Rivera, the closer nonpareil of the Yankees. The Yankee manager, Joe Torre, elected to pull his infielders all the way in to the edge of the infield grass, so that any one of them gloving a ground ball would have a better chance to throw home and prevent the deciding run from scoring. His other option was to play the fielders only partway in and hope that a ground ball might be turned into a third-to-first or second-to-first double play.
With the count 0 and 1, McCarver, augmenting the play-by-play of his partner Joe Buck, said:
"The one problem is Rivera throws inside to left-handers. Left-handers get a lot of broken-bat hits into shallow outfield, the shallow part of the outfield. That's the danger of bringing the infield in with a guy like Rivera on the mound."
As advertised, Rivera threw the next pitch on the inside corner. Gonzalez swung, hit the ball off his fists and blooped it into the air. It landed just beyond the infield dirt to the left of second base, where Derek Jeter, the shortstop, would have likely made a catch had he not been playing in. The game, and the Series, was over.
McCarver called a total of 24 World Series. For the first, on ABC in 1985, he was a replacement for Howard Cosell.
In some ways, McCarver's progression from behind the plate to behind the mic was a natural one. A catcher is often a ball club's on-field professor, its gatherer of knowledge and dispenser of experience. Many have become managers; many others, Joe Garagiola and Bob Uecker among them, have become broadcasters.
From their vantage point behind the plate, catchers are the only defensive players who are stationed behind the hitter, facing outward, and whose field of vision embraces the entire diamond. A catcher's partnership with his pitcher is a crucial element of any game, one that controls the pace and progress of the action. His pitch calls and glove placement help determine his teammates' defensive alignment, and his knowledge of opposing hitters is an indispensable boon to his battery mate in pitch selection and location.
Indeed, the position requires a level of braininess and concentration unmatched at any other position. And as much as anyone, McCarver, whose reputation for deep baseball knowledge led more than one team to show interest in him as a manager, was the personification of the cerebral catcher.
That said, he was a solid big-league ballplayer but not a candidate for Cooperstown as a player. He spent most of his career, which stretched from 1959 to 1980, with two National League teams, the St. Louis Cardinals and the Philadelphia Phillies. His power numbers were low; he hit fewer than 100 home runs in his career and never drove in as many as 70 runs in a season. Still, his career batting average of .271 was respectable, especially for a catcher.
"Did you ever try to figure out why a catcher's batting average isn't usually as high as that of most other players?" McCarver asked in "Oh Baby, I Love It!" (1987), one of the half-dozen books he wrote (this one with Ray Robinson). "The answer: His hands are swollen and always in pain. Try swinging a bat when your hands hurt."
Almost an M.V.P.
McCarver ran well; for the Cards in 1966, he led the league in triples with 13, the first time in baseball history a catcher did such a thing. That was his first year as an All-Star; the next year was his second.
In 1967, he hit .295, had career highs with 14 home runs and 69 runs batted in and finished second (behind his teammate Orlando Cepeda) in voting for the National League's Most Valuable Player award. With McCarver in the lineup, the Cardinals won the pennant in 1964, 1967 and 1968. He was a leading figure in the Cards' victory over the Yankees in the 1964 World Series, hitting safely in all seven games, batting .478 and blasting a 10th-inning three-run homer to win Game 5. McCarver hit poorly and was less of a factor in the Cards' 1967 Series win over Boston, but he hit .333 in the '68 Series against Detroit, though the Cardinals lost in seven games.
As a player, McCarver is probably best known as the battery mate of choice for two of the greatest pitchers in big-league history, Bob Gibson and Steve Carlton. Both were on the Cardinals in the 1960s, and McCarver was behind the plate for Gibson's 1968 season, in which his earned run average was a minuscule 1.12, the lowest for any pitcher in over a century.
Carlton joined the Cardinals in 1965, and McCarver caught his first two all-star seasons, 1968 and 1969; after that, they followed each other.
McCarver was traded to the Phils in 1970. (That trade is better remembered as a landmark in baseball's labor history. Along with McCarver, the Cardinals tried to send the outfielder Curt Flood to the Phillies, but he refused to report, and his subsequent lawsuit went to the Supreme Court. Unsuccessful in the end, it was nonetheless the start of the unraveling of the reserve clause, the part of a standard baseball contract that bound a player to his team in perpetuity, which in turn led to the era of free agency.) Carlton was sent to the Phils, an awful team, in February 1972, and that year had one of the most remarkable seasons ever for a pitcher, winning 27 games for a team that won only 59.
McCarver was his catcher for the start of that season; he was traded to Montreal in June, later back to the Cardinals and from there to the Red Sox, where his career stalled.
Released by Boston in June 1975, he was brought back to the Phillies, where Carlton's production had grown modest, and for the next few seasons he was Carlton's personal catcher while a younger player, Bob Boone, caught the other starters. The result: From 1976 to 1979, Carlton won 77 games, and the second of his four Cy Young Awards, and the Phillies reached the postseason three times.
McCarver was released after the 1979 season and began his broadcasting career the next year, but the Phillies brought him back in October 1980 so that he could join the short list of big leaguers who played in four separate decades. He appeared in six games; had one hit, a double; and occasionally handled two jobs at once, conducting television interviews in his Phillies uniform.

James Timothy McCarver was born in Memphis on Oct. 16, 1941, one of five children, and grew up in a tough neighborhood where his Roman Catholic family was a minority. His father, G.E. McCarver, known as Ed, was a Memphis police officer who became a private detective. His mother, Alice, was a religious woman who, McCarver recalled in "Oh Baby, I Love It!," lived vicariously through his athletic exploits and "used to make the sign of the cross on my back before I went out to play ball."
A multisport star at Christian Brothers High School in Memphis, a segregated school, he was recruited by football powerhouses like Notre Dame, Alabama and Tennessee. But he was also pursued by the Cardinals, the Giants and the Yankees, and he decided to play baseball because it offered him the chance to earn money right away.
He signed with the Cards for $ 75,000 and was just 17 years old when he began his professional career in the low minor leagues, in Keokuk, Iowa, in 1959. That September he played his first big-league games. He started each of the next two seasons in the minors, appearing briefly with the Cardinals in September. By 1963, however, he was the team's starting catcher.
McCarver married Anne McDaniel, whom he had met in high school, in 1964. The marriage ended in divorce. They had two daughters, Kelly and Kathy, who survive him, as do two grandchildren. His four siblings died before him.
Over the years, McCarver's prominence offered him other opportunities. Beyond his game-day appearances, he was host of "The Tim McCarver Show," a long-running program, first on radio and later on television, in which he interviewed athletes and other sports celebrities. He was a co-anchor, with Paula Zahn, of the 1992 Winter Olympics for CBS.
His books, written with co-authors, consisted largely of tales from the locker room and the diamond and instructions to fans about how to watch a ballgame. He was a fine bridge player who was cited in the bridge column of The New York Times. He appeared in a handful of movies, including "Moneyball," "Fever Pitch" and "The Naked Gun." And he even recorded an album, "Tim McCarver Sings Songs From the Great American Songbook."
But those were sidelights. In 2012, McCarver received the Ford C. Frick Award, essentially a lifetime achievement citation presented annually to a broadcaster by the National Baseball Hall of Fame for "major contributions to baseball."
Four years later, he was inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame.
"If you're going to talk about the best baseball analyst in the history of television," Dick Enberg, himself a Frick Award winner, said on that occasion, "Tim McCarver's name has to come up immediately."

Full text: He pushed the company into North America and beyond, setting it on its path to becoming one of the world's most powerful automakers.
TOKYO -- Shoichiro Toyoda, the chief of the automotive giant Toyota, who led the company as it expanded production into North America in the 1980s and helped transform it into a global brand, died on Tuesday. The son of the company's founder, he was 97.
Toyota said in a statement that the cause was heart failure. It did not say where he had died.
In a decade at Toyota's helm, Mr. Toyoda marshaled his considerable skills in engineering, management, politics and diplomacy to put the company on the path to passing General Motors as the world's largest automaker.
The accomplishment was all the more impressive because he took charge of Toyota at the height of U.S.-Japan trade tensions, in 1982, when Japanese cars had become a powerful symbol of American fears of a rising Japan replacing the United States as the world's largest economic power.
Despite those tensions, Mr. Toyoda expanded his company's production into North America, first forming an alliance with General Motors in 1984 before opening the company's first American plant, in Kentucky, in 1988, yielding to American pressure to produce cars in the United States.
By the end of his tenure, he had expanded production globally, making the company truly international.
Mr. Toyoda took a pragmatic approach to relations between the United States and Japan -- then the world's first and second largest economies -- arguing that as Japan rose, it needed to work harder to ingratiate itself with its competitors, a message that he made part of Toyota's corporate philosophy.
After stepping down as Toyota's chief executive, in 1994, he became the head of Japan's most powerful business lobby, where he helped shape the country's efforts to fight the economic stagnation that began in the early 1990s.
Shoichiro Toyoda was born on Feb. 27, 1925, in Nagoya, an industrial port city in central Japan, the second of four children of Kiichiro and Hatako Toyoda. He enjoyed a privileged childhood: In a 2014 column for the newspaper Nikkei Shimbun, he recounted how his elementary school classmates had teased him when he revealed that he breakfasted with his family's "maidservant."
His father founded Toyota Motor in 1937, spinning it off from an automatic loom manufacturer started by his father, Sakichi. The "d" in Toyoda was changed to a "t" in the company name because it was thought that it looked better when written in Japanese.
During World War II, Mr. Toyoda began studies at Nagoya University. He was passed over for the military draft because his major, engineering, was considered vital for the war effort, he wrote in the Nikkei article. When the war ended, he enrolled in a graduate program in Tohoku University and later received a doctorate from Nagoya University.
In 1950, a debt-racked Toyota split into two companies, one for manufacturing, which Kiichiro Toyoda ran, and the other for sales. Faced with a festering labor dispute, Kiichiro Toyoda was forced to resign, temporarily ending the family's leadership of the company. He died soon after.
Shoichiro Toyoda joined the company at 27 as director of the inspection department. Early in his career he played a key role in Toyota's first foray into the United States, signing off in 1957 on the export of the company's Crown model after taking it on an American road trip, which included a cheeky stop in front of Ford's headquarters in Detroit.
But American drivers rejected the car, complaining of its weak engine. The failure made Mr. Toyoda "determined to develop a high-quality passenger car that would perform well anywhere in the world," he wrote in the Nikkei in 2014.
Despite the flub, he quickly rose in the company's ranks, partly because of his talent for engineering and business and partly because of his family's continued influence over the business. By 1982, when the two halves of the company reunited, he was at the top.
It was a period of both great promise and risk for the company. Japan had surpassed the U.S. as the world's largest automaker, and with inflation, unemployment and protectionist sentiment running high in America, Tokyo and Washington agreed on the first of many rounds of import restrictions on Japanese automobiles.
While Nissan and Honda established American factories, Mr. Toyoda led the company into a deal with General Motors, intended to help the company increase its American sales. In an interview with The New York Times, one company executive said the move was like offering "salt to our enemy," a reference to Japan's feudal period, when warlords would sometimes feed people in enemy territory. Car and Driver magazine ran the headline "Hell Freezes Over." The partnership ended soon after General Motors declared bankruptcy in 2009.
Even as he competed with American companies, Mr. Toyoda pushed for Japanese companies to play a bigger role in the communities where they built their factories. In a 1990 speech, he encouraged Japanese industrialists to "contribute on the same level as Americans" by becoming active in local charitable organizations in the United States. (The Japanese government gave tax breaks to those that did.)
As Americans became enamored of Toyota's ultraefficient production practices, Mr. Toyoda started a management training center to help U.S. businesses. And he helped keep trade tensions down through concessions to Washington.
By 1992, when he stepped down as president to become the company's chairman, Toyota had plants in 22 countries and was competing with its former partner, General Motors, for the title of the world's largest automaker. It won that battle in 2008.
In 1994, as Japan's meteoric economic rise suddenly turned into a period of stagnation, Mr. Toyoda was appointed head of the business lobbying group Keidanren, where he spent four years pushing the country to reduce the many regulations that he believed hindered its growth.
He stepped down as Toyota's chairman in 1999 and became honorary chairman for life, a position from which he continued to influence the company's course. He was inducted into the U.S. Automotive Hall of Fame in 2007.
He is survived by his wife, Hiroko, whom he married in 1952; a son, Akio; and a daughter, Atsuko.
Reflecting on his career in the 2014 article, Mr. Toyoda wrote, "I have worked single-mindedly to add at least a few new lines to the auto industry history books."

Tim McCarver, 81, All-Star Catcher and Hall of Fame Broadcaster, Dies: [Obituary (Obit)]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Twice an All-Star, he played on four teams over four decades and won two World Series titles. Then he took his baseball smarts and gift of gab into the TV booth.
Tim McCarver, a durable big-league catcher who played in four decades, made two All-Star teams and won two World Series championships, but whose greater renown derived from his career as a Hall of Fame broadcaster, died on Thursday in Memphis. He was 81.
His death was announced by the National Baseball Hall of Fame, which said the cause was heart failure.
Known for his shrewd analysis of strategy, his literate use of metaphor and his penchant for predicting what was about to unfold on the field, often correctly, McCarver was sometimes a play-by-play announcer but most often a color man, a role that better suited his gift of gab.
His career spanned more than 30 years, from his start in Philadelphia in 1980, to his famous pairing with the former slugger Ralph Kiner in the Mets' booth, to his national appearances on four different networks, to stints with the Yankees and the San Francisco Giants.
Throughout, his informed, perceptive and articulate observations of the game were widely admired, and his gravelly tenor with a hint of his Tennessee upbringing in it became one of the game's most familiar voices.
Like all long-serving talking heads, McCarver had his detractors. Some said he talked too much, belabored the obvious, too often tangled his grammar and was overly thrilled by his own cleverness; examples abounded on a now-defunct web page, shutuptimmccarver.com, and he was mocked on "Family Guy." The Atlanta Braves outfielder Deion Sanders once took exception to a McCarver criticism and dumped a bucket of ice water over his head in the locker room after a game.
But more numerous were those who appreciated his independence of mind and his alertness to situational nuances in the game.
In defiance of a broadcasting norm, McCarver was not averse to criticizing the play of a team that employed him; when he was fired from the Mets job in 1999, after 16 seasons, it was reportedly because of just such candor. And his forthrightness often came with a flash of wit or wordplay. In a game in 1992, after watching the Mets' David Cone strike out Casey Candaele (pronounced can-DELL) of the Houston Astros on three pitches, McCarver quipped, "Looks like Cone burned the Candaele at both ends."
A Ninth-Inning Call
Perhaps his most famous moment as a broadcaster came in the final seconds of the 2001 World Series. In the bottom of the ninth inning of the seventh game, with the score tied, one out and the bases loaded, the Arizona Diamondbacks' Luis Gonzalez, a left-handed hitter, faced Mariano Rivera, the closer nonpareil of the Yankees. The Yankee manager, Joe Torre, elected to pull his infielders all the way in to the edge of the infield grass, so that any one of them gloving a ground ball would have a better chance to throw home and prevent the deciding run from scoring. His other option was to play the fielders only partway in and hope that a ground ball might be turned into a third-to-first or second-to-first double play.
With the count 0 and 1, McCarver, augmenting the play-by-play of his partner Joe Buck, said:
"The one problem is Rivera throws inside to left-handers. Left-handers get a lot of broken-bat hits into shallow outfield, the shallow part of the outfield. That's the danger of bringing the infield in with a guy like Rivera on the mound."
As advertised, Rivera threw the next pitch on the inside corner. Gonzalez swung, hit the ball off his fists and blooped it into the air. It landed just beyond the infield dirt to the left of second base, where Derek Jeter, the shortstop, would have likely made a catch had he not been playing in. The game, and the Series, was over.
McCarver called a total of 24 World Series. For the first, on ABC in 1985, he was a replacement for Howard Cosell.
In some ways, McCarver's progression from behind the plate to behind the mic was a natural one. A catcher is often a ball club's on-field professor, its gatherer of knowledge and dispenser of experience. Many have become managers; many others, Joe Garagiola and Bob Uecker among them, have become broadcasters.
From their vantage point behind the plate, catchers are the only defensive players who are stationed behind the hitter, facing outward, and whose field of vision embraces the entire diamond. A catcher's partnership with his pitcher is a crucial element of any game, one that controls the pace and progress of the action. His pitch calls and glove placement help determine his teammates' defensive alignment, and his knowledge of opposing hitters is an indispensable boon to his battery mate in pitch selection and location.
Indeed, the position requires a level of braininess and concentration unmatched at any other position. And as much as anyone, McCarver, whose reputation for deep baseball knowledge led more than one team to show interest in him as a manager, was the personification of the cerebral catcher.
That said, he was a solid big-league ballplayer but not a candidate for Cooperstown as a player. He spent most of his career, which stretched from 1959 to 1980, with two National League teams, the St. Louis Cardinals and the Philadelphia Phillies. His power numbers were low; he hit fewer than 100 home runs in his career and never drove in as many as 70 runs in a season. Still, his career batting average of .271 was respectable, especially for a catcher.
"Did you ever try to figure out why a catcher's batting average isn't usually as high as that of most other players?" McCarver asked in "Oh Baby, I Love It!" (1987), one of the half-dozen books he wrote (this one with Ray Robinson). "The answer: His hands are swollen and always in pain. Try swinging a bat when your hands hurt."
Almost an M.V.P.
McCarver ran well; for the Cards in 1966, he led the league in triples with 13, the only time in baseball history a catcher did such a thing. That was his first year as an All-Star; the next year was his second.
In 1967, he hit .295, had career highs with 14 home runs and 69 runs batted in and finished second (behind his teammate Orlando Cepeda) in voting for the National League's Most Valuable Player award. With McCarver in the lineup, the Cardinals won the pennant in 1964, 1967 and 1968. He was a leading figure in the Cards' victory over the Yankees in the 1964 World Series, hitting safely in all seven games, batting .478 and blasting a 10th-inning three-run homer to win Game 5. McCarver hit poorly and was less of a factor in the Cards' 1967 Series win over Boston, but he hit .333 in the '68 Series against Detroit, though the Cardinals lost in seven games.
As a player, McCarver is probably best known as the battery mate of choice for two of the greatest pitchers in big-league history, Bob Gibson and Steve Carlton. Both were on the Cardinals in the 1960s, and McCarver was behind the plate for Gibson's 1968 season, in which his earned run average was a minuscule 1.12, the lowest for any pitcher in over a century.
Carlton joined the Cardinals in 1965, and McCarver caught his first two all-star seasons, 1968 and 1969; after that, they followed each other.
McCarver was traded to the Phils in 1970. (That trade is better remembered as a landmark in baseball's labor history. Along with McCarver, the Cardinals tried to send the outfielder Curt Flood to the Phillies, but he refused to report, and his subsequent lawsuit went to the Supreme Court. Unsuccessful in the end, it was nonetheless the start of the unraveling of the reserve clause, the part of a standard baseball contract that bound a player to his team in perpetuity, which in turn led to the era of free agency.) Carlton was sent to the Phils, an awful team, in February 1972, and that year had one of the most remarkable seasons ever for a pitcher, winning 27 games for a team that won only 59.
McCarver was his catcher for the start of that season; he was traded to Montreal in June, later back to the Cardinals and from there to the Red Sox, where his career stalled.
Released by Boston in June 1975, he was brought back to the Phillies, where Carlton's production had grown modest, and for the next few seasons he was Carlton's personal catcher while a younger player, Bob Boone, caught the other starters. The result: From 1976 to 1979, Carlton won 77 games, and the second of his four Cy Young Awards, and the Phillies reached the postseason three times.
McCarver was released after the 1979 season and began his broadcasting career the next year, but the Phillies brought him back in October 1980 so that he could join the short list of big leaguers who played in four separate decades. He appeared in six games; had one hit, a double; and occasionally handled two jobs at once, conducting television interviews in his Phillies uniform.

James Timothy McCarver was born in Memphis on Oct. 16, 1941, one of five children, and grew up in a tough neighborhood where his Roman Catholic family was a minority. His father, G.E.

It landed just beyond the infield dirt to the left of second base, where Derek Jeter, the shortstop, would have likely made a catch had he not been playing in. The game, and the Series, were over.
McCarver called a total of 24 World Series. For the first, on ABC in 1985, he was a replacement for Howard Cosell.
In some ways, McCarver’s progression from behind the plate to behind the mic was a natural one. A catcher is often a ballclub’s on-field professor, its gatherer of knowledge and dispenser of experience. Many have become managers; many others, Joe Garagiola and Bob Uecker among them, have become broadcasters.
From their vantage point behind the plate, catchers are the only defensive players who are stationed behind the hitter, facing outward, and whose field of vision embraces the entire diamond. A catcher’s partnership with his pitcher is a crucial element of any game, one that controls the pace and progress of the action. His pitch calls and glove placement help determine his teammates’ defensive alignment, and his knowledge of opposing hitters is an indispensable boon to his battery mate in pitch selection and location.
Indeed, the position requires a level of braininess and concentration unmatched at any other position. And as much as anyone, McCarver, whose reputation for deep baseball knowledge led more than one team to show interest in him as a manager, was the personification of the cerebral catcher.
That said, he was a solid big-league ballplayer but not a candidate for Cooperstown as a player. He spent most of his career, which stretched from 1959 to 1980, with two National League teams: the St. Louis Cardinals and the Philadelphia Phillies. His power numbers were low; he hit fewer than 100 home runs in his career and never drove in as many as 70 runs in a season. Still, his career batting average of .271 was respectable, especially for a catcher.
“Did you ever try to figure out why a catcher’s batting average isn’t usually as high as that of most other players?” McCarver asked in “Oh Baby, I Love It!” (1987), one of the half-dozen books he wrote (this one with Ray Robinson). “The answer: His hands are swollen and always in pain. Try swinging a bat when your hands hurt.”
Almost an MVP
McCarver ran well; for the Cardinals in 1966, he led the league in triples with 13, the only time in baseball history a catcher did such a thing. That was his first year as an All-Star; the next year was his second.
In 1967, he hit .295, had career highs with 14 home runs and 69 RBIs in and finished second (behind his teammate Orlando Cepeda) in voting for the National League’s MVP award. With McCarver in the lineup, the Cardinals won the pennant in 1964, 1967 and 1968. He was a leading figure in the Cardinals’ victory over the Yankees in the 1964 World Series, hitting safely in all seven games, batting .478 and blasting a 10th-inning three-run homer to win Game 5. McCarver hit poorly and was less of a factor in the Cardinals’ 1967 Series win over Boston, but he hit .333 in the ’68 Series against Detroit, although the Cardinals lost in seven games.
As a player, McCarver is probably best known as the battery mate of choice for two of the greatest pitchers in big-league history, Bob Gibson and Steve Carlton. Both were on the Cardinals in the 1960s, and McCarver was behind the plate for Gibson’s 1968 season, in which his earned run average was a minuscule 1.12, the lowest for any pitcher in over a century.
Carlton joined the Cardinals in 1965, and McCarver caught his first two All-Star seasons, 1968 and 1969; after that, they followed each other.
McCarver was traded to the Phillies in 1970. (That trade is better remembered as a landmark in baseball’s labor history. Along with McCarver, the Cardinals tried to send outfielder Curt Flood to the Phillies, but he refused to report, and his subsequent lawsuit went to the Supreme Court. Unsuccessful in the end, it was nonetheless the start of the unraveling of the reserve clause, the part of a standard baseball contract that bound a player to his team in perpetuity, which in turn led to the era of free agency.) Carlton was sent to the Phillies, an awful team, in February 1972, and that year had one of the most remarkable seasons ever for a pitcher, winning 27 games for a team that won only 59.
McCarver was his catcher for the start of that season; he was traded to Montreal in June, later back to the Cardinals and from there to the Boston Red Sox, where his career stalled.
Released by Boston in June 1975, he was brought back to the Phillies, where Carlton’s production had grown modest, and for the next few seasons, he was Carlton’s personal catcher while a younger player, Bob Boone, caught the other starters. The result: From 1976 to 1979, Carlton won 77 games and the second of his four Cy Young Awards, and the Phillies reached the postseason three times.
McCarver was released after the 1979 season and began his broadcasting career the next year, but the Phillies brought him back in October 1980 so that he could join the shortlist of big-leaguers who played in four separate decades. He appeared in six games; had one hit, a double; and occasionally handled two jobs at once, conducting television interviews in his Phillies uniform.
A Son of Memphis
James Timothy McCarver was born in Memphis on Oct. 16, 1941, one of five children, and grew up in a tough neighborhood where his Roman Catholic family was a minority. His father, G.E. McCarver, known as Ed, was a Memphis police officer who became a private detective. His mother, Alice, was a religious woman who, McCarver recalled in “Oh Baby, I Love It!,” lived vicariously through his athletic exploits and “used to make the sign of the cross on my back before I went out to play ball.”
A multisport star at Christian Brothers Academy in Memphis, a segregated school, he was recruited by football powerhouses like Notre Dame, Alabama and Tennessee. But he was also pursued by the Cardinals, the Giants and the Yankees, and he decided to play baseball because it offered him the chance to earn money right away.
He signed with the Cardinals for $75,000 and was 17 years old when he began his professional career in the low minor leagues, in Keokuk, Iowa, in 1959. That September, he played his first big-league games. He started each of the next two seasons in the minors, appearing briefly with the Cardinals in September. By 1963, however, he was the team’s starting catcher.
McCarver married Anne McDaniel, whom he had met in high school, in 1964. The marriage ended in divorce. They had two daughters, Kelly and Kathy, who survive him, as do two grandchildren. His four siblings died before him.
Over the years, McCarver’s prominence offered him other opportunities. Beyond his game-day appearances, he was host of “The Tim McCarver Show,” a long-running program, first on radio and later on television, in which he interviewed athletes and other sports celebrities. He was a co-anchor, with Paula Zahn, of the 1992 Winter Olympics for CBS.
His books, written with co-authors, consisted largely of tales from the locker room and the diamond and instructions to fans about how to watch a ballgame. He was a fine bridge player who was cited in the bridge column of The New York Times. He appeared in a handful of movies, including “Moneyball,” “Fever Pitch” and “The Naked Gun.” And he even recorded an album, “Tim McCarver Sings Songs From the Great American Songbook.”
But those were sidelights.
In 2012, McCarver received the Ford C. Frick Award, essentially a lifetime achievement citation presented annually to a broadcaster by the National Baseball Hall of Fame for “major contributions to baseball.”
Four years later, he was inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame.
“If you’re going to talk about the best baseball analyst in the history of television,” Dick Enberg, himself a Frick Award winner, said on that occasion, “Tim McCarver’s name has to come up immediately.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sometime very soon, one hopes, the Biden administration will attempt to explain to the American people what they think our fighters shot down over Lake Huron and northern Canada and off Alaska, be they balloons or drones or something somewhat stranger. If that happens, we will take a meaningful step toward solving a longstanding, conspiracy-shadowed mystery: What, exactly, are all the unidentified flying objects -- sorry, sorry -- unidentified aerial phenomena that our military keeps encountering in the skyfields above planet Earth?
But maybe it won't be as big a step as one might hope. Maybe some of the debris won't be found at all (as the administration is now hinting) or we won't fully identify some of the objects. Maybe the government will classify the details, or the‌ objects will be officially identified as drones or balloons but their origins will remain uncertain. Maybe the takeaway will just be that we have very little idea of what goes on in our own skies, making more outlandish theories seem, if anything, more credible than they did a few weeks ago.
This would fit one of the patterns of our era, which is what you might call the incomplete reveal. Sometimes a phenomenon goes from being the subject of crank theories and sub rosa conversations to being more mainstream, but without actually being fully explained or figured out. Or sometimes a controversy takes center stage for a little while, a great deal seems to hang upon the answer, and then it isn't resolved and seems to get forgotten. What's at stake in these kinds of cases isn't a conspiracy theory (though they may give rise to them) but a question or a secret -- something that's acknowledged to matter, that's theoretically knowable, but that slips away from reach.
The U.A.P. story so far has been an obvious example. ‌In the last few years the government and the media have finally acknowledged the existence of a genuinely strange phenomenon. But there hasn't been sustained mainstream pressure (because that would be too weird and paranoid) on public officials or institutions to get closer to the bottom of what's going on.
What are some other examples? Glad you asked. Here's a list:
Who blew up the Nord Stream pipelines?
Last week, Seymour Hersh published a story on his Substack alleging that U.S. Navy divers planted the explosives that sabotaged gas pipelines linking Russia to Germany. There are good reasons to doubt the story, starting with its apparent reliance on a single source and working through various factual and plausibility issues. Hersh is famous for breaking important stories and also for getting other stories badly wrong.
But somebody blew up the pipelines. Was it Russia? Parts of Western officialdom suggested as much at first, but after months of investigations we are still waiting for compelling evidence, or a compelling argument for why it would be in Moscow's interest to make it much more difficult to quickly restart the flow of energy they are trying to use for blackmail. Was it the United States, acting to force Russia into a deeper isolation by weakening its immediate energy leverage over Europe? The Biden administration denies any involvement, and it would have been quite the act of recklessness for an administration that's been very cautious about direct engagement with the Russians.
"In today's increasingly transparent world," the Carnegie Endowment's Sergey Vakulenko wrote soon after the sabotage, the truth of whodunit "might not stay buried for long." But many months later, we've got Hersh's dubious claim of excavation and not much else.
What were Jeffrey Epstein's secrets?
Set aside the did-he-kill-himself debate: More than three years after Epstein's apparent suicide, it's the larger mysteries about the predator-panderer that still hang unresolved. We don't fully understand how he made his money; the story of his ascent, as an adviser to the clothing-retail mogul Leslie Wexner, still feels like a sketch with crucial details missing. We don't fully understand why he received such leniency in his Bush-era go-round with law enforcement and the courts. Epstein "belonged to intelligence" -- that's how Alexander Acosta, the Florida prosecutor turned Trump administration secretary of labor, reportedly explained his own part in that leniency. But we still don't know the truth about Epstein's possible ties to our own government or others, how his alleged methods of blackmail and surveillance worked, and so on.
Also, speaking as someone with a cautious interest in outré spiritualities, I'd like to know more -- or even just something -- about the weird, temple-like structure on one of his private islands, whose inspiration and intended purposes is still obscure.
Did the coronavirus leak from a Chinese laboratory?
Here the obstacles to certain answers are obvious: The crucial evidence is controlled by an increasingly uncooperative authoritarian state; the scientific debate is shadowed by the vested interest that some of our own health and science institutions have in "gain of function" research; and the question has been entangled from the start with the Trump-era culture wars.
But imagine if, several years after a major earthquake struck Los Angeles or San Francisco, we still didn't know whether it was a normal quake or a demolition accidentally induced by geological experiments conducted by a major geopolitical rival. That's basically where we stand today with the entire pandemic, and our uncertainty about its origins is linked to crucial questions about the likelihood of future outbreaks, the wisdom and safety of publicly funded scientific research projects and, of course, our relationship to China. However much energy our institutions are putting into resolving this question, it seems like more would be a good idea.
What exactly happened between Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford?
This is a case where partisans on both sides are sure they know the answer, and everybody else has moved on -- and maybe moving on is just the reasonable thing. But Dr. Blasey's partisans are still at work, convinced that what's been lacking is a wider net, more allegations beyond hers: A documentary on the case from Doug Liman, the director of "Swingers" and "The Bourne Identity," apparently focuses anew on allegations and alleged incidents from Kavanaugh's time at Yale.
Whereas what I thought during the 2018 Senate hearings, and still think now, is that Dr. Blasey's initial accusation should be more amenable to focused investigation. Meaning that, whether she was telling the truth or lying or misremembering in some important way, we should be able to get at least a little more certainty from all of the different people who were connected to the alleged house party -- from the names on Kavanaugh's calendar to Dr. Blasey's own family to Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey's mutual connections and more. I thought then that somebody in greater Georgetown knew more than what had been revealed, one way or another, and I still think that today.
At the very least, I would like to read the final F.B.I. report that senators read before they voted, insufficient as it may have been.
And who knows -- maybe I can find that report buried under an altar in Epstein's temple, or attached to one of the strings that our pilots thought they saw dangling from the U.A.P. around Lake Huron just before they shot it down.

How to Score a Vintage Handbag: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: What's a good deal? Where should you look?
The ubiquity of certain "it" handbags on social media can create a feeling of snow blindness when you're scrolling online. If you want to break out of that trend cycle, the solution is obvious: Get a vintage bag.
This is a wild and exciting world to dive into! It's also overwhelming. Allow me to talk you through it. You'll want to take your time, familiarize yourself with sellers' authentication guarantees, do research on serial numbers, get a lay of the land on competitive pricing and learn to understand the subtleties of how sellers describe the conditions of their goods. Sounds exhausting but trust me, it's worth it.
You should know things like what Prada calls its nylon (tessuto) and the name of Bottega Veneta's woven leather (intrecciato). Never hesitate to ask questions or request more photos -- advice that also applies to life in general.
For our purposes, we're using a loose definition of vintage: at least a decade old. There are many, many, many strategies for shopping for vintage bags. One way is to frequent vintage shops that carry a lot of bags. Check out What Goes Around Comes Around in New York and Beverly Hills, Calif., or Dina C's Fab & Funky Consignment Boutique in Palm Beach, Fla. (a.k.a., destination shopping heaven). Browse by designer at a resale site like ReBag or Fashionphile. Visit super-specific destinations like ClosetfullofCoco on Instagram, which sells Chanel exclusively -- and almost all of it bags.
If you need something to do after eating lunch and before returning to work, browsing Christie's Collection of André Leon Talley is a solid use of your time. Mr. Talley was not just a fashion historian and writer but a real shopper. While few can attend the live auction on Feb. 15, and fewer can place a winning bid on a beige ponyhair Chanel bag or a black Ralph Lauren alligator duffel, looking at the collection can inspire your own vintage bag rabbit hole.
Satin is one of my favorite materials for bags, especially small evening bags with drawstrings or fringe. Renaud Pellegrino's bright pink satin bag would be ideal for a night at the ballet, maybe. Also, look for materials that were often used in past decades, like tortoiseshell, resin or Bakelite.
Or you might try looking for earlier pieces from your favorite labels. Search for Kate Spade from the early aughts when some of the bags were made in Italy. You can find wonderful Tom Ford-era Gucci or Yves Saint Laurent bags. Ditto Louis Vuitton bags in Epi leather, a Vuitton-specific creation that's textured with tiny wavy ridges.
Another way to search is by looking for bag shapes that were all the rage before your time. I like to search for frame bags or top handle bags; the Céline clasp bag from just a few years ago is a favorite. For a treat, try minaudières, a whole world unto itself. Maybe a Judith Leiber egg?
Important note! You won't look costume-y if you wear any of these with normal clothes. But looking like you're in costume isn't always a bad thing.
Roberta di Camerino
A friend of mine who designs accessories loves to search for Sharif bags from the 1980s and Susan Gail bags for their high quality leather. Another classic is Roberta di Camerino, an Italian brand whose heyday was in the midcentury and whose bags are known for trompe l'oeil and color-blocking. Once you see the bags, you can't unsee their influence in other designers' work -- Prada, Gucci. There are a lot of bags around at an array of prices. I prefer the velvet to the vinyl and would wear it with thin wale corduroy pants. 640 euros; about $ 700
Mark Cross
For a certain kind of fashion fixated person, the biggest revelation in "Rear Window" was the box bag Grace Kelly's character carried. There are vintage versions of the bag on 1stdibs.com, but Mark Cross continues to make a smaller version of the bag that Gerald Murphy, who ran Mark Cross, designed in 1954 for the film, called the Rear Window Day Case. (Mr. Murphy and his wife, Sara, were significant Lost Generation figures, legendary for their time in the South of France.) I find the interior mirror completely charming. Black is practical, but who needs practical? Go with the celadon. $ 3,590
Hermès
The Birkin and the Kelly bags are more or less household names, but Hermès has a deep bench of lesser known styles: Picotin, Chevreuse, Chaîne D'Ancre, Cordelière, Sandrine. "I think many overlook all of the wonderful styles Hermès had in the '60s," said Zabrina Estrada, who owns Etéreo Vintage in Brooklyn. "I love the Palonnier in a skin, and the Piano bag is also really chic." Her dream bag is the Mallette, which has a lockable compartment for jewelry. The Brooklyn Museum has one owned by Babe Paley that was donated by her social secretary! $ 13,000
Manolo Blahnik
I consider companies whose bags are less celebrated than other things they make a whole category of vintage. Bally fits in there, as does any bag from Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, Nina Ricci, Fortuny and Ferragamo. Kudos to whoever gets this gold and pink metallic polka-dot Manolo clutch worthy of Cher Horowitz, Carrie Bradshaw or other '90s protagonists. $ 487.50
Chanel
Vintage Chanel bags go in a lot of directions. You could get a wild piece from one of its collections, like an $ 84,000 shopping basket from 2014 made out of the house's signature chains. Take it to the farmers' market? But as with Hermès, the elegant move would be a piece from the 1960s, like a chocolate brown Ottoman bag with a lipstick red lining. Why does red lining make everything better? 1,800 euros; about $ 1,960
Louis Vuitton
Skip all the Louis Vuitton logos, unless you're buying a trunk. Instead, go for simple. Sumptuous. Mysterious but privileged. I'm talking about Sofia Coppola! But specifically, the Louis Vuitton Sofia Coppola SC Bag Leather PM. The navy blue is classic. In fact, everything about this bag is classic. I'd be happy with any color -- light brown, cherry red, oxblood -- and it's large enough to carry a laptop, wallet, tiny notepad for deep thoughts, a bag of Doritos. You know, the essentials. $ 2,005

A Warning Signal on Self-Driving Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Metz, Cade

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Missy Cummings, who spent more than a year at the federal auto safety agency, said that drivers were putting too much trust in systems like Tesla's Autopilot and that regulators needed to restrict their use.
Last fall, Missy Cummings sent a document to her colleagues at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that revealed a surprising trend: When people using advanced driver-assistance systems die or are injured in a car crash, they are more likely to have been speeding than people driving cars on their own.
The two-page analysis of nearly 400 crashes involving systems like Tesla's Autopilot and General Motors' Super Cruise is far from conclusive. But it raises fresh questions about the technologies that have been installed in hundreds of thousands of cars on U.S. roads. Dr. Cummings said the data indicated that drivers were becoming too confident in the systems' abilities and that automakers and regulators should restrict when and how the technology was used.
People "are over-trusting the technology," she said. "They are letting the cars speed. And they are getting into accidents that are seriously injuring them or killing them."
Dr. Cummings, an engineering and computer science professor at George Mason University who specializes in autonomous systems, recently returned to academia after more than a year at the safety agency. On Wednesday, she will present some of her findings at the University of Michigan, a short drive from Detroit, the main hub of the U.S. auto industry.
Systems like Autopilot and Super Cruise, which can steer, brake and accelerate vehicles on their own, are becoming increasingly common as automakers compete to win over car buyers with promises of superior technology. Companies sometimes market these systems as if they made cars autonomous. But their legal fine print requires drivers to stay alert and be ready to take control of the vehicle at any time.
In interviews last week, Dr. Cummings said automakers and regulators ought to prevent such systems from operating over the speed limit and require drivers using them to keep their hands on the steering wheel and eyes on the road.
"Car companies -- meaning Tesla and others -- are marketing this as a hands-free technology," she said. "That is a nightmare."
But these are not measures that NHTSA can easily put in place. Any effort to rein in how driver-assistance systems are used will probably be met with criticism and lawsuits from the auto industry, especially from Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, who has long chafed at rules he considers antiquated.
Safety experts also said the agency was chronically underfunded and lacked enough skilled staff to adequately do its job. The agency has also operated without a permanent leader confirmed by the Senate for much of the past six years.
Dr. Cummings acknowledged that putting in effect the rules she was calling for would be difficult. She said she also knew that her comments could again inflame supporters of Mr. Musk and Tesla who attacked her on social media and sent her death threats after she was appointed a senior adviser at the safety agency.
But Dr. Cummings, 56, one of the first female fighter pilots in the Navy, said she felt compelled to speak out because "the technology is being abused by humans."
"We need to put in regulations that deal with this," she said.
The safety agency and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. G.M. pointed to studies that it had conducted with the University of Michigan that examined the safety of its technology.
Because Autopilot and other similar systems allow drivers to relinquish active control of the car, many safety experts worry that the technology will lull people into believing the cars are driving themselves. When the technology malfunctions or cannot handle situations like having to veer quickly to miss stalled vehicles, drivers may be unprepared to take control quickly enough.
The systems use cameras and other sensors to check whether a driver's hands are on the wheel and his or her eyes are watching the road. And they will disengage if the driver is not attentive for a significant amount of time. But they operate for stretches when the driver is not focused on driving.
Dr. Cummings has long warned that this can be a problem -- in academic papers, in interviews and on social media. She was named senior adviser for safety at NHTSA in October 2021, not long after the agency began collecting crash data involving cars using driver-assistance systems.
Mr. Musk responded to her appointment in a post on Twitter, accusing her of being "extremely biased against Tesla," without citing any evidence. This set off an avalanche of similar statements from his supporters on social media and in emails to Dr. Cummings.
She said she eventually had to shut down her Twitter account and temporarily leave her home because of the harassment and death threats she was receiving at the time. One threat was serious enough to be investigated by the police in Durham, N.C., where she lived.
Many of the claims were nonsensical and false. Some of Mr. Musk's supporters noticed that she was serving as a board member of Veoneer, a Swedish company that sells sensors to Tesla and other automakers, but confused the company with Velodyne, a U.S. company whose laser sensor technology -- called lidar -- is seen as a competitor to the sensors that Tesla uses for Autopilot.
"We know you own lidar companies and if you accept the NHTSA adviser position, we will kill you and your family," one email sent to her said.
Jennifer Homendy, who leads the National Transportation Safety Board, the agency that investigates serious automobile crashes, and who has also been attacked by fans of Mr. Musk, told CNN Business in 2021 that the false claims about Dr. Cummings were a "calculated attempt to distract from the real safety issues."
Before joining NHTSA, Dr. Cummings left Veoneer's board, sold her shares in the company and recused herself from the agency's investigations that solely involved Tesla, one of which was announced before her arrival.
The analysis she sent to agency officials in the fall looked at advanced driver-assistance systems from multiple companies, including Tesla, G.M. and Ford Motor. When cars using these systems were involved in fatal crashes, they were traveling over the speed limit 50 percent of the time. In crashes with serious injuries, they were speeding 42 percent of the time.
In crashes that did not involve driver-assistance systems, those figures were 29 percent and 13 percent.
The amount of data that the government has collected on crashes involving these systems is still relatively small. Other factors could be skewing the results.
Advanced drivers-assistance systems are used far more often on highways than on city streets, for instance. And the crash data that Dr. Cummings analyzed is dominated by Tesla, because its systems are more widely used than others. This could mean that the results unfairly reflect on the performance of systems offered by other companies.
During her time at the federal safety agency, she also examined so-called phantom braking, which is when driver-assistance systems cause cars to slow or stop for no apparent reason. Last month, for example, the news site The Intercept published footage of a Tesla vehicle inexplicably braking in the middle of the Bay Bridge connecting San Francisco and Oakland and causing an eight-car pileup that injured nine people, including a 2-year-old.
Dr. Cummings said data from automakers and customer complaints showed that this was a problem with multiple driver-assistance systems and with robotaxis developed by companies like Waymo, owned by Google's parent company, and Cruise, a division of G.M. Now under test in multiple cities, these self-driving taxis are designed to operate with no driver, and they are ferrying passengers in San Francisco and the Phoenix area.
Many crashes apparently happen because people traveling behind these cars are not prepared for those erratic stops. "The cars are braking in ways that people do not anticipate and are not able to respond to," she said.
Waymo and Cruise declined to comment.
Dr. Cummings said the federal safety agency should work with automakers to restrict advanced driver-assistance systems using its standard recall process, where the companies agree to voluntarily make changes.
But experts questioned whether the automakers would make such changes without a significant fight.
The agency could also establish new rules that explicitly control the use of these systems, but this would take years and could result in lawsuits.
"NHTSA could do this, but would the courts uphold it?" said Matthew Wansley, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York who specializes in emerging automotive technologies.
Dr. Cummings said robotaxis were arriving at about the right pace: After limited tests, federal, state and local regulators are keeping a lid on their growth until the technology is better understood.
But, she said, the government must do more to ensure the safety of advanced driver-assistance systems like Autopilot and Super Cruise.
NHTSA "needs to flex its muscles more," she said. "It needs to not be afraid of Elon or of moving markets if there is an obvious unreasonable risk."

Last fall, Missy Cummings sent a document to her colleagues at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that revealed a surprising trend: When people using advanced driver-assistance systems die or are injured in a car crash, they are more likely to have been speeding than people driving cars on their own.
The two-page analysis of nearly 400 crashes involving systems such as Tesla’s Autopilot and General Motors’ Super Cruise is far from conclusive. But it raises fresh questions about the technologies that have been installed in hundreds of thousands of cars on U.S. roads. Cummings said the data indicated that drivers were becoming too confident in the systems’ abilities and that automakers and regulators should restrict when and how the technology was used.
People “are overtrusting the technology,” she said. “They are letting the cars speed. And they are getting into accidents that are seriously injuring them or killing them.”
Cummings, an engineering and computer science professor at George Mason University who specializes in autonomous systems, recently returned to academia after more than a year at the safety agency. On Wednesday, she will present some of her findings at the University of Michigan, a short drive from Detroit, the main hub of the U.S. auto industry.
Systems such as Autopilot and Super Cruise, which can steer, brake and accelerate vehicles on their own, are becoming increasingly common as automakers compete to win over car buyers with promises of superior technology. Companies sometimes market these systems as if they made cars autonomous. But their legal fine print requires drivers to stay alert and be ready to take control of the vehicle at any time.
In interviews last week, Cummings said automakers and regulators ought to prevent such systems from operating over the speed limit and require drivers using them to keep their hands on the steering wheel and eyes on the road.
“Car companies — meaning Tesla and others — are marketing this as a hands-free technology,” she said. “That is a nightmare.”
But these are not measures that NHTSA can easily put in place. Any effort to rein in how driver-assistance systems are used will probably be met with criticism and lawsuits from the auto industry, especially from Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, who has long chafed at rules he considers antiquated.
Safety experts also said the agency was chronically underfunded and lacked enough skilled staff to adequately do its job. The agency has also operated without a permanent leader confirmed by the Senate for much of the past six years.
Cummings acknowledged that putting in effect the rules she was calling for would be difficult. She said she also knew that her comments could again inflame supporters of Musk and Tesla who attacked her on social media and sent her death threats after she was appointed a senior adviser at the safety agency.
But Cummings, 56, one of the first female fighter pilots in the Navy, said she felt compelled to speak out because “the technology is being abused by humans.”
“We need to put in regulations that deal with this,” she said.
The safety agency and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. GM pointed to studies that it had conducted with the University of Michigan that examined the safety of its technology.
Because Autopilot and other similar systems allow drivers to relinquish active control of the car, many safety experts worry that the technology will lull people into believing the cars are driving themselves. When the technology malfunctions or cannot handle situations such as having to veer quickly to miss stalled vehicles, drivers may be unprepared to take control quickly enough.
The systems use cameras and other sensors to check whether a driver’s hands are on the wheel and his or her eyes are watching the road. And they will disengage if the driver is not attentive for a significant amount of time. But they operate for stretches when the driver is not focused on driving.
Cummings has long warned that this can be a problem — in academic papers, in interviews and on social media. She was named senior adviser for safety at NHTSA in October 2021, not long after the agency began collecting crash data involving cars using driver-assistance systems.
Musk responded to her appointment in a post on Twitter, accusing her of being “extremely biased against Tesla,” without citing any evidence. This set off an avalanche of similar statements from his supporters on social media and in emails to Cummings.
She said she eventually had to shut down her Twitter account and temporarily leave her home because of the harassment and death threats she was receiving at the time. One threat was serious enough to be investigated by the police in Durham, North Carolina, where she lived.

Bill Chan had never set foot anywhere in Mexico, let alone the lonely stretch of desert in the north of the country where he abruptly decided to build a $ 300 million factory. But that seemed a trifling detail amid the pressure to adapt to a swiftly changing global economy.
It was January 2022, and Mr. Chan's company, Man Wah Furniture Manufacturing, was confronting grave challenges in moving sofas from its factories in China to customers in the United States. Shipping prices were skyrocketing. Washington and Beijing were locked in a fierce trade war.
Man Wah, one of China's largest furniture companies, was eager to make its products on the North American side of the Pacific.
"Our main market is the United States," said Mr. Chan, chief executive of Man Wah's Mexico subsidiary. "We don't want to lose that market."
That same objective explains why scores of major Chinese companies are investing aggressively in Mexico, taking advantage of an expansive North American trade deal. Tracing a path forged by Japanese and South Korean companies, Chinese firms are establishing factories that allow them to label their goods "Made in Mexico," then trucking their products into the United States duty-free.
The interest of Chinese manufacturers in Mexico is part of a broader trend known as nearshoring. International companies are moving production closer to customers to limit their vulnerability to shipping problems and geopolitical tensions.
The participation of Chinese companies in this shift attests to the deepening assumption that the breach dividing the United States and China will be an enduring feature of the next phase of globalization. Yet it also reveals something more fundamental: Whatever the political strains, the commercial forces linking the United States and China are even more powerful.
Chinese companies have no intention of forsaking the American economy, still the largest on earth. Instead, they are setting up operations inside the North American trading bloc as a way to supply Americans with goods, from electronics to clothing to furniture.
The Mexican border state of Nuevo León has positioned itself to reap the bounty. Led by a brash, 35-year-old governor, Samuel García, the state has courted foreign investment while pursuing highway improvements to ease the passage to border crossings.
Mr. García recently attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to recruit more companies.
"Nuevo León is having a geopolitical planetary alignment," the governor declared during an interview in the state capital of Monterrey, inside the government palace, a warren of grand rooms with high ceilings and balconies looking out to the jagged peaks of the Sierra Madre. "We're receiving lots of Asians that want to come to the U.S. market."
Since Mr. García took office in October 2021, nearly $ 7 billion in foreign investment has poured into Nuevo León, making the state the largest recipient after Mexico City, according to the Mexican Ministry of Economy.
In 2021, Chinese companies were responsible for 30 percent of foreign investment in Nuevo León, second only to the United States at 47 percent.
Some of this money is financing factories that will make finished products for sale in the United States. But much is focused on a broader refashioning of the global supply chain.
As the pandemic disrupted Chinese industry and jammed ports, companies with factories in the United States suffered shortages of parts made in Asia. Many are now demanding that their suppliers set up plants in North America or risk losing their business.
Lizhong, a Chinese manufacturer of automobile wheels, is erecting the company's first factory outside Asia at an industrial park in Nuevo León. Lizhong's largest customers, including Ford Motor and General Motors, pressed the company to open a factory in North America, said its general manager for Mexico, Wang Bing.
A South Korean company, DY Power, which makes components for construction equipment, is considering northern Mexico as the site for a factory near a major customer in Texas.
"After going through the pandemic and the supply chain crisis, the China Covid shutdown, many North American manufacturers would like to eliminate the risk," said Sean Seo, a Seattle-based executive for DY Power.
"Globalization has ended," he declared. "It's local-ization now."
César Santos has placed a substantial bet on such pronouncements proving true.
A corporate lawyer, Mr. Santos, 65, runs a sideline enterprise as a developer in Monterrey, an industrial boomtown full of upscale restaurants, glittering shopping malls and spas.
A decade ago, he was approached by a developer in Los Angeles who was representing a Chinese electronics company that was contemplating a factory in Mexico. Mr. Santos controlled an asset of considerable interest -- a 2,100-acre parcel of land.
Dotted by cactus, the property sat less than 150 miles from the Texas border. While surrounding states grappled with violence linked to drug trafficking, Nuevo León carried a reputation for security. The state boasted a highly skilled work force, given the presence of universities that churned out engineering graduates, among them Tec de Monterrey, often referred to as "Mexico's M.I.T."
The land was his family's cattle ranch when Mr. Santos was a child, the scene of horseback riding adventures. Now, he saw a lucrative opportunity to turn it into an industrial park.
He took a trip to China, riding a high-speed train from Shanghai to the lakefront city of Hangzhou to meet the Holley Group, which had constructed an industrial park for Chinese companies in Thailand.
"China was a country that had developed everything so fast," Mr. Santos said. "I was really amazed."
By 2015, he had joined with Holley and another Chinese partner to forge a joint venture, Hofusan Real Estate. They plan a grid of warehouses and factories fronted by a hotel and temporary apartments for visiting managers, plus more than 12,000 homes for workers.
The Holley Group dispatched Jiang Xin to oversee the venture. He had previously worked at the company's project in Thailand. Mexico presented a different proposition.
"Chinese companies had no idea about Mexico, and the only things we knew were bad things, dangerous things," Mr. Jiang said. "Then Trump came."
When he became president in 2017, Donald J. Trump demanded that American companies abandon China. By 2018, he was slapping steep tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese imports.
"The tariff thing did help us," Mr. Jiang said. "Chinese companies wanted more options. And we are one of their options."
By the time Mr. Chan began contemplating Mexico in the fall of 2021, 27 other Chinese companies had already locked up land inside the Hofusan park. Only one large parcel remained.
Man Wah had already responded to the tariffs by building a factory in Vietnam, and using it to make products for the American market. But the soaring price of shipping beggared that strategy.
Man Wah was moving 3,500 40-foot shipping containers a month across the Pacific from Vietnam. Voyages that previously cost $ 2,000 were suddenly 10 times as much.
Mr. Chan used the Chinese social media platform WeChat to connect with Mr. Jiang. His questions were blunt. How soon could Man Wah begin construction? (Immediately.) How were the highways? (Not great, but improving.) Were there any authentic Chinese restaurants in the vicinity? (No.)
Within weeks, Man Wah had committed to purchase the land. In January 2022, Mr. Chan signed the contract before boarding a flight to Mexico, leaving his wife and two children behind in the Chinese city of Shenzhen.
While the factory is being constructed, Man Wah has already begun producing sofas at a small, leased plant nearby.
Even before he located the temporary site, Mr. Chan loaded 70 containers full of machinery and raw materials in China, putting them on a ship bound for Mexico.
"We always do things quickly," he said. "Don't worry about anything, just do it."
Man Wah does worry about a few things: hiring enough workers and cultivating local suppliers.
The company has plans to manufacture nearly 900,000 pieces of furniture per year in Mexico. That will require hiring and retaining 6,000 workers.
Man Wah is accustomed to operating in China and Vietnam, where independent labor unions are essentially barred, and where rural people stream into industrial areas in pursuit of jobs.
In Nuevo León, the unemployment rate is 3.6 percent. The surge of investment has set off a fierce competition for workers.
Savvy companies have wooed their employees with extras like quality meals and transportation to work. But Man Wah and other Chinese companies answer to bosses in China, who are conditioned toward thrift while thinking of workers as easily replaceable.
Finding local suppliers is also a challenge. Under the terms of the North American trade agreement, manufacturers must employ minimum percentages of parts and raw materials from within the region to qualify for duty-free access to the other countries in the bloc.
Three years ago, Lenovo, the Chinese computer maker, opened a factory in Monterrey dedicated to making servers, the boxes that hold data for cloud computing.
Until last year, Lenovo flew in one crucial component -- so-called motherboards -- from a factory in China. But as international shipping troubles intensified, the company switched to a supplier in the Mexican city of Guadalajara.
Lenovo also stopped importing packaging materials from China, instead buying them in Mexico.
But Lenovo continues to import many key components from China, from memory devices to specialized cables.
"There's no supply chain for these things in Mexico," said Leandro Sardela, the company's Western operations director.
At least, not yet.

U.S. Is Aiming to Curtail Tech Investments in China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Biden administration is preparing new rules that would restrict U.S. dollars from flowing to China.
WASHINGTON -- Growing concerns about China's military and economic ambitions have lawmakers and the White House weighing yet another effort to restrict Beijing's access to advanced technologies that could be used in war.
This time, the U.S. government appears poised to extend its restrictions to a new area: American dollars that are used to finance the development of such technologies within Chinese borders.
For months, the Biden administration has been preparing curbs on the investments that U.S. firms can make in China, particularly in areas like advanced computing.
Those measures are now largely complete and could be issued within two months. The Treasury Department has been reaching out to other governments, including the European Union, to try to ensure that they do not rush in to provide similar financing to China after the United States cuts it off, according to people familiar with the discussions.
The voyage of a spy balloon across the United States has set off newfound fears about the national security threats posed by the Chinese government. This week, lawmakers on both sides warned the White House that if the administration did not move ahead with investment restrictions, Congress would propose its own.
At a hearing on Tuesday aimed at publicizing the security threat from China, Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer, Republican of Missouri, said it was the "committee's job to examine all interconnections between the Chinese and U.S. economy, specifically connections supporting China's military and human rights abuses, and pursue options to eliminate U.S. capital flowing into those areas."
Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, said the United States needed to make sure that "hedge funds, private equity firms and Wall Street are not investing in ways that hurt our economy or funding the adversarial actions of the Chinese government."
Members of the Biden administration spent much of last year weighing how broadly to apply investment restrictions, with officials reaching out to business executives to get their views on the impact that such a move might have.
Details of the pending executive order remain unclear, but it is expected to require companies to report more information to the government about their planned investments in certain adversarial countries. Several people familiar with the plans said the order would most likely prohibit outright investments in some sensitive areas, like quantum computing, advanced semiconductors and certain artificial intelligence capabilities with military or surveillance applications.
U.S. officials have also increasingly been concerned about China's use of biotechnology, but several people said the administration had decided to exclude the sector, at least initially.
Supporters of investment restrictions say they would help fill in a significant hole in the economic barriers that the United States is setting up with China. The government already prohibits U.S. companies from directly selling certain advanced technologies to China, and it has long monitored the investments that Chinese companies make in the United States for potential security risks.
But the government has little control over or insight into money traveling from the United States to China, said Claire Chu, a senior China analyst at Janes, a defense intelligence firm. Support has been building for the government to take more oversight of these kinds of deals, she said.
"It's not so much a matter of whether this will happen as when," Ms. Chu said.
Some of the proposals have prompted resistance from industry groups, which argued that overly broad restrictions could overwhelm government officials in charge of oversight, creating big delays, and ricochet back on the U.S. economy, harming its competitiveness.
A broader proposal in Congress last year to review outbound investments in critical sectors including infrastructure and medicine prompted pushback from groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S.-China Business Council.
"Industry is kind of united: We don't want this," said Antonia Tzinova, a partner at the law firm Holland & Knight who specializes in national security reviews of investments into the United States.
The Biden administration's plan appears to be much more narrowly targeted at a few sensitive sectors. But some industry representatives remain concerned that measures that apply only to U.S. firms, and not their foreign competitors, could put American businesses at a disadvantage.
Others say that China has access to plenty of other sources of funding worldwide, and that cutting off access would prevent U.S. companies from benefiting from Chinese innovations.
"Getting the details right on outbound investment screening is easier said than done," said Rory Murphy, the vice president of government affairs for the U.S.-China Business Council. "These are technical and complicated sectors, and the details are critical."
He added that his group wanted to "help policymakers thread the needle of achieving their national security objectives while not going too broad and putting U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage."
Investment firms including Blackstone, KKR, Sequoia, Carlyle Group, Bain Capital, Silver Lake, General Atlantic and Warburg Pincus all have notable exposure to China. According to tracking by Rhodium Group, a research firm with a focus on China, U.S. investors have been carrying out about 3,000 transactions per year in China, including both foreign direct investment and venture capital deals, with about 500 of those valued at more than $ 1 million.
Bill Ford, the chief executive of General Atlantic, an investment firm, has expressed his views about possible regulation directly with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, a person familiar with the matter said.
General Atlantic says it has invested nearly $ 7 billion in China since 2000 with more than 34 portfolio companies in the country. One of its highest-profile investments there, ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, has found itself in the cross hairs of the debate over how to manage U.S.-Chinese financial ties.
Depending on how it is put into effect, this new tool could fundamentally alter the country's financial relationship with China, one of America's largest trading partners but also a primary geopolitical rival.
U.S. companies spent about $ 11 billion in 2022 buying or investing in Chinese companies, according to the data service firm Dealogic. While that is a small slice of the more than $ 1.5 trillion that U.S. companies invested globally that year, China deals are still considered valuable because they may provide venture firms access to innovation and, possibly, their next big win.
Venture firms, which seed earlier-stage companies, have been particularly active in the region. According to data compiled by Pitchbook, for example, the investment firm GGV Capital did 105 deals from 2021 to 2022; GSR Ventures did 95. Other notable names on the list include Tiger Global Management, which did 27 deals in the same period. Intel's venture capital firm did 17 deals in the same period, while Qualcomm's venture arm did 16.
Until very recently, the U.S. government's role was to try to expand financial ties with China. For example, greater access for American financial services firms was one major part of the trade deal that President Donald J. Trump reached with Chinese officials in 2020.
At a White House ceremony where he signed the deal into law, Mr. Trump name-checked executives from Citadel, Carlyle, Goldman Sachs and Blackstone, some of whom had become unofficial back channels with the Chinese government during negotiations for a trade pact that could prove lucrative to their businesses.
"Steve, I know you have no interest in this deal at all," Mr. Trump said sarcastically to Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of Blackstone Group, who was seated in the audience at the White House. "I'm surprised you're not actually sitting over here on the ledge of the stage."
Since that trade deal was signed, U.S. attitudes toward China have turned even more negative and suspicious. The Chinese government has embraced a system of techno-authoritarianism that has used U.S. technologies to surveil dissidents in China and abroad. It has also become clear that some private Chinese tech firms have fed into Beijing's efforts to develop military technologies, like hypersonic missiles.
The Biden administration has steadily placed more restrictions on selling advanced technology to China, expanding the initial restrictions that Mr. Trump issued against Chinese firms like Huawei.
It remains to be seen whether the administration's planned restrictions will mollify lawmakers who are calling for tough restrictions, or prompt Congress to propose more draconian measures.
Lawmakers previously considered imposing broader restrictions as part of a bill aimed at building up American semiconductor manufacturing that passed last year. But those measures were stripped out of the final legislation, partly because of how expansive they were.
In September, a group of top lawmakers sent a letter to the Biden administration urging it to take action to review investments in adversarial countries like China.
In a government spending bill that President Biden signed late last year, Congress included $ 20 million for the Commerce and Treasury Departments to begin to set up teams to review such investments. It also instructed them to submit a joint report by later this month describing the potential program and the resources it would need.

Full text: And everything else you need to know to hold forth on fashion month at a cocktail party.
Get ready. Your feeds are about to be crammed full of color, sparkle, celebrities and opinion. Fashion month is upon us: hundreds of shows in four cities vying not just for your wardrobes, but for your eyeballs and even sense of outrage.
Who will be bidding for Oscar red carpet glory? Can anyone top the Schiaparelli lion head? Will there be any scandals and controversies? Here's what you need to know
It's make or break time for Balenciaga.
That might seem like hyperbole, but it is not. This is the single most fraught show of the season. Maybe of any season. As you may recall, Balenciaga -- regularly called the hottest brand of the last five years in any fashion ranking thanks to the ability of Demna, its designer, to hold a finger up to the cultural winds and capture them in clothes and context -- had a spectacular fall from grace last fall.
It started in October when Ye, or the artist formerly known as Kanye West, opened the Balenciaga "mud" show, only to follow up with his own Yeezy show to which he wore a White Lives Matter T-shirt, which presaged a host of antisemitic and anti-Black comments. Slow to distance themselves from the rapper, Balenciaga then went live with a holiday ad campaign featuring teddy bear handbags in B.D.S.M. gear held by children, followed by another campaign that contained papers related to a U.S. Supreme Court child pornography case tucked in a pile.
A public outcry ensued, with Balenciaga accused of promoting pedophilia, boycotted and otherwise canceled. Apologies, when they finally came (after an attempt to blame a set design team), were halfhearted. Assumptions were that heads would have to roll, but both Demna and Cédric Charbit, the chief executive, remained in place. Holiday sales, especially in the United States market, have, by all accounts, been dismal. And the Lyst shopping platform reported that in the last quarter of 2022, Balenciaga fell out of its ranking of the top 10 most searched brands for the first time since the index was created in 2018.
Save for the apologies, Balenciaga has remained almost entirely silent, though on Feb. 8 it announced a three-year partnership with the National Children's Alliance, focusing on training and raising awareness of child abuse and protection. The show will be its next major visible statement.
Will Demna use the platform to address the problems? Will he offer some sort of dramatic mea culpa? Can Balenciaga rewrite the narrative and make its products desirable again? Will anyone even go to the show, given the general antipathy for the brand and fears of a backlash against being seen to support it? Will there be protests?
It's all riding on this show, scheduled ton March 5 in Paris.
Burberry is trying to bring back Cool Britannia.
Burberry, the biggest luxury brand in Britain and a sort of doppelgänger for the country, lost its way in recent years under the designer Riccardo Tisci and the chief executive Marco Gobbetti, offering up an outsider-goth version of Britishness that included deer ear prosthetics, backless trench coats and a video inspired by a "love affair between a mermaid and a shark" that included white-clad acolytes swaying in a forest.
But after almost a complete shift at the top, two Brits -- Daniel Lee, the new designer, and Jonathan Akeroyd, the chief executive -- are now in charge, tasked with re-centering the heritage at the heart of the house. Change has already begun, with a new logo that is a throwback to the original Burberry Prorsum horse and rider minted in 1901, plus a teaser ad campaign starring Vanessa Redgrave, Liberty Ross, Skepta and Lennon Gallagher. Yes, the son of Liam Gallagher and Patsy Kensit, the original Cool Britannia couple of 1997. As clues to where this is going, it's pretty clear.
Obscuring the picture, however, is Mr. Lee himself, who left his previous position as the wunderkind creative director who revamped Bottega Veneta in late 2021 under a cloud of rumors about bad behavior and staff turnover. Mr. Lee has not addressed the issues, nor made any statement about what he has been doing since (other than traveling), a glaring omission in a time of increasing corporate consciousness-raising and value-signaling.
All of which means that while the show is about rehabbing Burberry, it's also about Mr. Lee rehabbing his reputation. Not to mention rehabbing the image of Britain, which, with Brexit, Boris and inflation, could use a win.
Generational change is happening in New York.
There has been a lot of moaning about New York Fashion Week losing its superstars, after Calvin Klein closed its runway line and Marc Jacobs and Ralph Lauren decided to make their own schedules. But in their absence a rare thing is happening: generational change.
The new guard may not be household names, but they are rethinking what American sportswear means and who gets to define it, in a way that has the potential to reshape fashion for the next decade or more, and to make New York another rare thing: a genuinely diverse design hub.
Thom Browne is taking over from Tom Ford as head of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. The two most thrilling showmen in the city, Mr. Browne and Willy Chavarria, lead with theater and emotion, not commerce and calculation. Also look for Heron Preston, bringing his form of "instant language," upcycling and archetypes, back from Paris; Raul Lopez of Luar, who imbues his edgy, gender-agnostic lux with his own back story; Everard Best of Who Decides War, the designer turning jeans into couture; and Taofeek Abijako of Head of State, whose post-colonial storytelling pairs every product he makes with a community-improvement project, both at home (upstate New York) and in Nigeria (where his parents are from) and who dressed Danai Gurira and Evan Mock for last year's Met Gala.
For these designers, fashion isn't just business or art; it's nakedly personal. Sometimes literally naked. They are each building their own communities, reflecting the changing demographics of an evolving world. If they can make it past the start-up phase, they will be the new fashion establishment of the city.
And Harry Styles's favorite designer is debuting in Paris.
Harris Reed, 26, the half-American, half-British, much feted but largely unproven name who made the ball gown Harry Styles wore in Vogue in 2020, and the polka-dot Seussical suit Shania Twain wore to the Grammys on Feb. 5, is the new designer at Nina Ricci, a brand that has been struggling to define itself beyond its perfume pretty much since it tried to move beyond perfume. Mr. Reed's dramatic gender-bending one-offs garner a lot of attention and celebrity kudos when he shows under his own name in London, but they do not exactly scream "commercially viable!" so there's a lot riding on his debut.
It's a similar story with Ludovic de Saint Sernin, 27, the new designer at Ann Demeulemeester, whose genderless shredded peekaboo aesthetic has found fans in Kim Kardashian, Dua Lipa and Rihanna. The Belgian brand, once the epitome of slouchy, existential hipness, has lost some of its mojo in recent years, existing on the good will of its former self. Mr. Saint Sernin's job is to change that trajectory.
The question, in both cases, will be how the designers translate their drama into wearability -- or whether, in the Instagram-TikTok age, statement-making is actually the ultimate goal.

The Curse of the Philippines' Geography: [Op-Ed]

Full text: For Filipinos like me who grew up under the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos Sr., the news that the U.S. military would expand its presence in the Philippines has been dizzying and wounding.
The image of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin shaking hands in Manila last week with the country's fatuously smiling president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son of the former despot, was like some tragic "Groundhog Day." Mr. Marcos was elected in May. So Filipinos find themselves not only with another President Marcos but also with another creeping occupation by the U.S. military under the guise of East Asian security.
The Philippine Senate put an end to the permanent basing of American forces three decades ago. But according to Mr. Austin, China's growing shadow in the region makes a renewed American presence essential.
The Philippines' proximity to China has long been seductive for the United States. For Filipinos, it's a curse.
The 1898 U.S. annexation of the islands from the previous colonizer, Spain, after the Spanish-American War provided a foothold for American goods to get access to the real prize: China's huge market. As Albert Beveridge, a senator from Indiana, put it in 1900, "The Pacific is our ocean .... Where shall we turn for consumers of our surplus? Geography answers the question. China is our natural customer." The Philippines, he said, gave the United States a "base at the door of all the East."
Filipinos fighting for the nation's freedom from 1899 to 1902 had no chance against U.S. forces. During the Philippine-American war, more than 200,000 Filipinos were killed or died from famine or disease, and the conflict has been likened to genocide and the U.S. wars against Native Americans. What followed was the creation of a nation "in our image," as the American historian Stanley Karnow described it.
American greed and geopolitics entrenched Philippine oligarchy as a matter of policy because it strengthened U.S. control. Taking on a feudal template laid down by the Spanish, a few powerful families prospered in the U.S. neocolonial orbit, consolidating land, resources and power through the Cold War and into the current era of China's global ascendancy.
Scenes of abiding U.S.-Philippine relations are seared into our collective memory, like a form of trauma: Richard Nixon playing the piano as Imelda Marcos applauded, Ms. Marcos grooving with Gerald Ford, Mr. Marcos Sr. dancing closely with Nancy Reagan. As U.S. leaders waltzed with Mr. Marcos Sr., he imposed martial law from 1972 to 1981 -- my childhood years. The tyrant thrived during the Cold War, using his U.S.-funded counterinsurgency campaign, which targeted Communists, to consolidate power. He imprisoned, tortured or killed thousands and stole an estimated $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion until a people's uprising in 1986 exiled him and his family to Hawaii.
China's predations are another nightmare for the Philippines. Mr. Austin cited China's continued advancement of its "illegitimate claims" in portions of the South China Sea that are also claimed by the Philippines as a reason for the U.S. military's return. And there is fear of a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan, which is just 93 miles from the Philippines' northernmost island, Itbayat. The Philippines is not the only Southeast Asian country wary of getting caught in the crossfire.
Chinese encroachment on the South China Sea, which has included building military installations, has been globally condemned. In 2016 an international tribunal ruled in the Philippines' favor, rejecting China's maritime claims. But the Philippine president at the time, Rodrigo Duterte, who cozied up to Beijing in a desire for Chinese investments, dismissed the tribunal's ruling in deference to China. ("I need China," he once declared. "I simply love Xi Jinping.") He also frequently maligned the United States. Like all Philippine oligarchs, though, he danced with America, retaining a military pact with Washington.
The departure of the mercurial Mr. Duterte, whose murderous drug war has resulted in thousands of extrajudicial killings, is welcome. But his successor isn't much different. Mr. Marcos Jr. won the presidency after a campaign powered by disinformation and has never disavowed his father's legacy of cronyism and corruption. His 28-year-old son, Sandro, a political neophyte, has been given a senior leadership position in the Philippine House of Representatives; Mr. Marcos's cousin Martin Romualdez is speaker of the House. They were among the authors of a bill to facilitate a plan by the new Marcos government to take money out of social security systems and pump it into a sovereign investment fund, which drew a public outcry.
Mr. Marcos made himself agriculture secretary, a powerful position. Under his leadership, costs of basic food items are soaring, with the price of onions surpassing meat at one point recently. Drug-war killings and a culture of impunity continue. Indigenous activists, journalists, human rights defenders and others branded as Communists are at risk. Mr. Marcos is fond of junkets, traveling to Davos with a large entourage. His government has not been transparent about the costs. What he does with the boondoggle of American military money is no fool's guess. As it was with his father, American support will be used to deflect public criticism.
Mr. Duterte and Mr. Marcos are cut from the same cloth: Their families and cronies have profited from U.S. geopolitical and military interest in the Philippines and will continue to do so.
For all of the troubled history, President Biden has a chance to redeem the United States. Representative Susan Wild of Pennsylvania has urged her colleagues to sign the Philippine Human Rights Act, which would suspend security assistance to the Philippines "until violence against dissidents ceases and accountability against the perpetrators commences." Ms. Wild and a bipartisan group of legislators also are calling for sanctions against Philippine human rights violators.
Until then, the long dance between Washington and Manila continues, to the recurring horror of the Filipino people.

Full text: Andrea Riseborough got the nod for the little-seen "To Leslie." The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is reviewing whether her A-list campaign violated rules.
When the Oscar nominations were announced last week, one of the most surprising was Andrea Riseborough's inclusion in the best actress category.
Ms. Riseborough's portrayal of a former lottery winner battling addiction in the little-seen "To Leslie" had received scant recognition on the awards circuit. Few critics included the film on their best-of-the-year lists, and it made just $ 27,000 at the box office during its initial release in October.
Yet just as voting for the Oscars began, a number of A-list actors started lauding Ms. Riseborough's performance publicly. "Andrea should win every award there is and all the ones that haven't been invented yet," Gwyneth Paltrow wrote on Instagram, joining dozens of actors like Edward Norton and Susan Sarandon who lavished praise on Ms. Riseborough. Kate Winslet hosted a screening of the film, and during a virtual question-and-answer session with Ms. Riseborough and the film's director, Michael Morris, called Ms. Riseborough's work "the greatest female performance onscreen I have ever seen in my life."
"The thing that feels most exciting is being acknowledged by your community," Ms. Riseborough told The New York Times on the day she was nominated. "It's a marker by which we measure ourselves in so many ways -- by those we aspire to be like, or those we admire. So it's huge."
But what at first seemed like a story of how a grass-roots -- though star-studded -- word-of-mouth campaign had managed to help a respected actress crash the Oscar party quickly drew backlash.
There were soon questions of whether the efforts on behalf of Ms. Riseborough had violated Oscar rules ("Was the Andrea Riseborough Oscar Campaign Illegal?" read a headline in the Hollywood newsletter by Puck's Matthew Belloni) and whether Ms. Riseborough, who is white, had secured a nomination that may otherwise have gone to a Black actress like Viola Davis ("The Woman King") or Danielle Deadwyler ("Till").
"We live in a world and work in industries that are so aggressively committed to upholding whiteness and perpetuating an unabashed misogyny towards Black women," Chinonye Chukwu, the director of "Till," wrote on Instagram after the nominations. Ms. Chukwu did not mention Ms. Riseborough or "To Leslie" in her post.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will take up the matter of Ms. Riseborough's nomination during a previously scheduled meeting on Tuesday. Among the issues will be whether the campaign violated any academy rules and, if so, what the repercussions should be.
At issue seems to be the efforts by the actress Mary McCormack, who is married to Mr. Morris, and her manager, Jason Weinberg, who also represents Ms. Riseborough, to get her friends and acquaintances in the entertainment industry to watch the film and talk about it. Neither Ms. McCormack nor Mr. Morris is a member of the academy, though many of the actors who praised Ms. Riseborough's performance are.
Howard Stern, Ms. McCormack's co-star in the 1997 film "Private Parts," praised "To Leslie" on his satellite radio show, and the veteran actress Frances Fisher repeatedly posted about it on Instagram, writing on Jan. 14 that voters should select Ms. Riseborough since "Viola, Michelle, Danielle & Cate are a lock for their outstanding work." Mentioning competitors or their films directly is verboten when campaigning. Voters are also not supposed to be courted directly, without the academy acting as a gatekeeper of sorts.
The specter of rescinding Ms. Riseborough's nomination has been raised, but one longtime academy member, who discussed internal matters on the condition of anonymity, considered that unlikely since she did not make the direct appeals to voters herself. An acting nomination has never been rescinded, though it has happened in other categories.
Ms. Riseborough declined to comment. Mr. Weinberg did not respond to requests seeking comment from him and Ms. McCormack.
The academy declined to comment for this article, but it released a statement that said, "We are conducting a review of the campaign procedures around this year's nominees, to ensure that no guidelines were violated, and to inform us whether changes to the guidelines may be needed in a new era of social media and digital communication."
Oscars campaigning has been a blood sport for decades. The modern Machiavelli for the process was, after all, Harvey Weinstein, who became notorious for bludgeoning would-be voters with parties, screenings and not-so-subtle whisper campaigns.
The process has become only more sophisticated. In 2019, for instance, Netflix rented two soundstages on a historic movie lot in Hollywood to push for "Roma." The voters who attended "'Roma' Experience Day" received breakfast and lunch and there were hours of panel discussions with Alfonso Cuarón, the movie's director, and his crew.
But there are rules, many of them put into place after Oscar campaigning turned into an entire industry, employing scores of consultants and strategists and generating millions of dollars of revenue for the trade publications that accept "For Your Consideration" advertisements.
Studios are permitted to send out only one email a week to Oscar voters, and they cannot send them directly. The emails must be routed through messaging services sanctioned by the academy. According to one awards consultant, who described the process on the condition of anonymity, each email blast can cost $ 2,000.
Screenings are permitted, with "reasonable" food and drink. (The rule book doesn't spell out the definition of "reasonable.") Everything must be provided in the same location where the movie was shown. Lavish dinners across the street or across town are not allowed.
As for individual lobbying, the academy includes only a one-line explanation of what is forbidden: "Contacting academy members directly and in a manner outside of the scope of these rules to promote a film or achievement for Academy Award consideration is expressly forbidden."
In 2010, Nicolas Chartier, a producer of "The Hurt Locker," was barred from attending the Academy Awards after he sent emails to voters urging them to vote for his film and not "Avatar." In 2014, the composer Bruce Broughton contacted members directly, asking them to vote for his song from the unheralded film "Alone Yet Not Alone." He received a nomination, but the academy rescinded it. In 2017, a sound mixing nomination for Greg P. Russell ("13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi") was rescinded for a similar reason. In each case, the academy declined to add a fifth nominee.
Ric Robertson, the academy's former chief operating officer and a member for 24 years, said a failure to address the issues of personally lobbying voters could lead to more concerted campaigns.
"This campaign sounds like it was organic," Mr. Robertson, who was involved in putting many of the campaigning rules into effect, said of Ms. Riseborough's situation. "It came about because a couple of prominent people really liked the film and the performance and used their connections to promote it. Well, it could get a lot more organized next year and institutionalized at other companies."
Though "To Leslie" was unknown to many voters before numerous stars began praising it, Ms. Riseborough is a respected British actress with a chameleonic flair. She has spent the past two decades playing complicated women in mostly independent films. She has worked for directors as varied as Alejandro G. Iñárritu ("Birdman"), Tom Ford ("Nocturnal Animals") and Mike Leigh ("Happy-Go-Lucky"). Mr. Morris previously directed her in the Netflix series "Bloodline."
And since the questions about Ms. Riseborough's campaign have arisen, there has been a backlash to the backlash. The "unabashed solicitation of Oscar votes," The Hollywood Reporter's Scott Feinberg said, "is a tradition almost as old as the academy itself."
For the Oscars, this is the latest in a string of controversies in recent years. Some were self-inflicted, like the two consecutive years the organization nominated only white actors, which spawned the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite and led the academy to begin overhauling and diversifying its membership. The exclusion of Ms. Davis and Ms. Deadwyler, and Ms. Chukwu's comments after the nominations, show that the issue remains a raw one.
Last year, as the Oscars were trying to recover from the pandemic, Will Smith shocked a global audience by slapping Chris Rock onstage during the telecast. Shortly after, Mr. Smith returned to the stage to accept the best actor trophy. The academy subsequently barred him from Oscar-related events, including the ceremony, for the next decade.
As for "To Leslie," which barely had the funds to pay the $ 20,000 fee to submit it to the academy's portal so members could watch it, all of the attention has seemed to help, a little.
Momentum Pictures, its distributor, returned the film to six theaters this past weekend, betting that Ms. Riseborough's nomination would intrigue audiences. According to The Hollywood Reporter, it grossed around $ 250,000.

Transforming Grief Into Comedy: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Jason Segel knows that you like him.
It's the sad eyes. The pained smile. The shambling 6-foot-4-inch frame that he diminishes by caving in his chest. It's his single season on the critics' darling "Freaks and Geeks," playing a puppyish high schooler; his nine seasons on the audience favorite "How I Met Your Mother," as a loving, excitable husband and dad; his slate of rom-coms. If you saw the 2008 film "Forgetting Sarah Marshall," which he also wrote, you spent 73 frames opposite his exposed penis during a mortifying breakup scene. And, most likely, you came out still liking him.
"I've built up some currency, some good will," Segel said. "Like, 'Oh, he's a good guy; he wouldn't do anything intentionally mean."' This was on a January video call, and Segel was recounting an early conversation he'd had with Bill Lawrence and Brett Goldstein about their Apple TV+ sitcom "Shrinking." The first two episodes premiere on Friday; eight more follow weekly.
Segel, 43, who joined the series as a writer, executive producer and star, opposite Harrison Ford and Jessica Williams, plays Jimmy, a cognitive behavioral therapist crushed by personal grief. A year after the sudden death of his wife, Jimmy self-medicates with pills, booze and some very polite sex workers. He is a neglectful father and a bad neighbor. His approach to patient care would make an ethics panel weep. Another comic actor might have tried to protect his likability. Segel, in this role, wanted to squander it.
"We have to use that for evil," he recalled telling Lawrence and Goldstein. "We should spend that currency."
Segel, who grew up in a comfortable, beach-adjacent neighborhood of Los Angeles, became a professional actor by inclination and deceit. He was an anxious kid, burdened from an early age, he said, by "a sense of impending doom." Acting classes were a rare space in which he felt comfortable. By high school, though, his basketball schedule (he was, as his height suggests, a star) kept him from auditioning for most school plays. His theater teacher persuaded him to star in a three-night run of Edward Albee's "The Zoo Story." Without telling Segel, that teacher invited a leading casting director from Paramount, who liked what she saw.
"I'm baffled by people who take the bus to L.A. and say, 'I'm gonna make it,"' Segel said, moving his thickly stubbled face closer to the camera. He wore a gray plaid shirt, his brown hair cresting high above his forehead, a wave that never broke. "That's bravery. Me, I got really lucky."
He landed a role on "Freaks and Geeks" not long after. Precocious, he had a quarter-life crisis at 20, when that series ended after 18 episodes. He was too old and too tall to play more high schoolers and too young for anything else. Judd Apatow, the executive producer of "Freaks and Geeks," encouraged him to write. A few years later, just after he was cast in "How I Met Your Mother," he had begun "Sarah Marshall."
Nicholas Stoller, who directed that movie, admired the script's sweetness and Segel's sweetness, too. The character Segel played, like many he had played and would play, verged on creepy and pathetic without tumbling over. "He's willing to have his characters do bad stuff because it's human, it's relatable," Stoller said. "But he just grounds it in kindness."
That movie set the template for the next six years: Film the sitcom for eight months and then make a movie during the hiatus, often one that he had written or co-written. But when "How I Met Your Mother" ended in 2014, Segel, then 34 and still precocious, had his midlife crisis. This one felt more existential. He'd been acting for half of his life and figured he was good at it. And he'd written films he was proud of, like "Sarah Marshall" and the 2011 Muppets movie. But was this his purpose? Writing and delivering joke after joke after joke?
Segel explored the alternatives. Newly sober, he left Los Angeles, moving several hours north, to a property with orange groves. He chose projects more sparingly. To begin, he signed on to star in "The End of the Tour," a movie about the writer David Foster Wallace. He hadn't really done a drama since "The Zoo Story." But he recognized parallels between himself and the film's version of Wallace, who has just published his masterwork, "Infinite Jest."
"It's this moment where everyone is saying, 'You've won life,"' Segel said. "And you are feeling so scared. Like, Oh, no. What's next?"
He didn't know. He wasn't writing, and he didn't find anything funny. But maybe he just didn't want to write comedy, he realized, which led him to create "Dispatches from Elsewhere," a 2020 limited series about four adrift souls ensnared by an alternative reality game.
"While it wasn't the most commercial thing I've ever written, it was maybe the most meaningful," Segel said. "I proved I could make something again." He began to theorize that maybe he needed to make work that let him use more of himself -- the comedy stuff and the not-so-comic stuff. He sought projects that encouraged him to be what a therapist might describe as "integrated."
"Like, let's make this one weird guy," he said. "That's maybe what the point of all of this has been about."
That revelation led him first to "Winning Time," the flashy drama about the Los Angeles Lakers (Segel plays an unflashy, melancholic coach), and then to "Shrinking." Lawrence and Goldstein, who met on "Ted Lasso," had each been roughing out separate shows about grief and therapy before deciding that they should make a show together. Segel was their first choice to lead it.
"Because he has that thing: He's funny, he's a great actor, inherently likable," Goldstein said, adding a few expletives. "An audience will follow Jason Segel very far before they turn on him, and that's a gift."
Lawrence, on a separate video call, agreed. "He's got this underlying vulnerability and it makes him so empathetic," Lawrence said. "Even when he does something lousy, as his character, you go, 'Oh, I wonder why he did that. Is he OK?"' Lawrence, who has multiple projects in the works, also liked the idea of an actor who could do some heavy lifting in the writers' room.
They pitched him the show. Segel was quiet on the call, so quiet that Goldstein worried that he didn't like the idea. After a day or two, Segel accepted. He explained this delay as the upside of that midlife crisis: Now he takes his time choosing his jobs. But he knew he would take the part as soon as he heard the pitch. "Shrinking," he realized, would require both nanosecond comic timing and deep sensitivity. He would have to make an audience believe that this was a man overwhelmed by grief, and then make that grief funny without ever cheapening Jimmy's pain.
Pain interests him. It's often the first question he asks himself about a character: How is this person suffering? And he figured that years into a pandemic, the audience for "Shrinking" might also be in pain. He has always seen himself as the kind of actor who functions as an audience surrogate -- he mentioned Tom Hanks, Jimmy Stewart, Kermit the Frog. If a viewer could see Jimmy working through his pain, maybe that viewer could do some work, too.
"What a crazy, sad couple of years," he said. "To find a way to laugh about this together is really hard and potentially really special."
This is where the evil comes in -- Segel didn't want to make safe choices. The character had to feel volatile, even dangerous, if only to himself. Only by showing Jimmy at his absolute worst could he show the character starting to build himself back up again. On set, Segel leaned into this, so far that he sometimes fell over. Lawrence recalled shooting a scene in an early episode, in which Jimmy shouts at his next-door neighbor Liz (Christa Miller, Lawrence's wife).
"He was, like, 'I feel like I can yell at her more here,"' Lawrence recalled.
That antagonism was only for the camera. "I was surprised at how comfortable he is to act with," Williams, his co-star, said. "There was nothing that I could do that he didn't understand and that he wasn't able to catch."
Nearly everyone I spoke to described Segel as a man who had "done the work": who had become comfortable enough in his own skin, with or without professional help, that he could extend generosity and compassion to himself and others. He didn't speak much about his personal experience of therapy (which suggests the kind of healthy boundaries that a good clinician would encourage), except to say that it had helped alleviate some of that existential dread and that he was thankful for it.
James Ponsoldt directed Segel in "The End of the Tour" and in several episodes of "Shrinking." Looking at Segel through the camera's lens, he said, "I see someone who's grateful to be alive, someone who has lived and knows that being alive is better than not being alive."
An actor is not necessarily the characters he plays, but Segel understands nearly all of his roles, Jimmy included, as versions of himself. He views his life (and this is arguably a little less healthy) as a series of minor and major embarrassments that he can funnel into art. The other day, he said, on vacation, he'd gone for a run on the beach and fallen on his face in front of several onlookers. Another man might have felt shame; Segel figured he could probably use it.
Probably he will. The stage and the set are the places where he has always felt best able to transmute dread or low-key humiliation into something that might make someone else feel a little better. It makes him feel better, too.
Williams recalled their first day of shooting. It was a tense scene and she felt nervous, awkward. But Segel reassured her. Soon they were riffing.
When "cut" was called, she turned to him and said, "Acting is really fun."
He looked at her, she recalled, and thought about it for a while. And then he said, "Yeah, it really is. It's like the funnest thing on earth."

Jason Segel knows that you like him.
It’s the sad eyes. The pained smile. The shambling 6-foot-4-inch frame that he diminishes by caving in his chest.

“Because he has that thing: He’s funny, he’s a great actor, inherently likable,” Goldstein said, adding a few expletives. “An audience will follow Jason Segel very far before they turn on him, and that’s a gift.”
Lawrence, on a separate video call, agreed. “He’s got this underlying vulnerability and it makes him so empathetic,” Lawrence said. “Even when he does something lousy, as his character, you go, ‘Oh, I wonder why he did that. Is he OK?’” Lawrence, who has multiple projects in the works, also liked the idea of an actor who could do some heavy lifting in the writers’ room.
They pitched him the show. Segel was quiet on the call, so quiet that Goldstein worried that he didn’t like the idea. After a day or two, Segel accepted. He explained this delay as the upside of that midlife crisis: Now he takes his time choosing his jobs. But he knew he would take the part as soon as he heard the pitch. “Shrinking,” he realized, would require both nanosecond comic timing and deep sensitivity. He would have to make an audience believe that this was a man overwhelmed by grief, and then make that grief funny without ever cheapening Jimmy’s pain.
Pain interests him. It’s often the first question he asks himself about a character: How is this person suffering? And he figured that years into a pandemic, the audience for “Shrinking” might also be in pain. He has always seen himself as the kind of actor who functions as an audience surrogate — he mentioned Tom Hanks, Jimmy Stewart, Kermit the Frog. If a viewer could see Jimmy working through his pain, maybe that viewer could do some work, too.
“What a crazy, sad couple of years,” he said. “To find a way to laugh about this together is really hard and potentially really special.”
This is where the evil comes in — Segel didn’t want to make safe choices. The character had to feel volatile, even dangerous, if only to himself. Only by showing Jimmy at his absolute worst could he show the character starting to build himself back up again. On set, Segel leaned into this, so far that he sometimes fell over. Lawrence recalled shooting a scene in an early episode, in which Jimmy shouts at his next-door neighbor Liz (Christa Miller, Lawrence’s wife).
“He was, like, ‘I feel like I can yell at her more here,’” Lawrence recalled.
That antagonism was only for the camera. “I was surprised at how comfortable he is to act with,” Williams, his co-star, said. “There was nothing that I could do that he didn’t understand and that he wasn’t able to catch.”
Nearly everyone I spoke to described Segel as a man who had “done the work”: who had become comfortable enough in his own skin, with or without professional help, that he could extend generosity and compassion to himself and others. He didn’t speak much about his personal experience of therapy (which suggests the kind of healthy boundaries that a good clinician would encourage), except to say that it had helped alleviate some of that existential dread and that he was thankful for it.
James Ponsoldt directed Segel in “The End of the Tour” and in several episodes of “Shrinking.” Looking at Segel through the camera’s lens, he said, “I see someone who’s grateful to be alive, someone who has lived and knows that being alive is better than not being alive.”
An actor is not necessarily the characters he plays, but Segel understands nearly all of his roles, Jimmy included, as versions of himself. He views his life (and this is arguably a little less healthy) as a series of minor and major embarrassments that he can funnel into art. The other day, he said, on vacation, he’d gone for a run on the beach and fallen on his face in front of several onlookers. Another man might have felt shame; Segel figured he could probably use it.
Probably he will. The stage and the set are the places where he has always felt best able to transmute dread or low-key humiliation into something that might make someone else feel a little better. It makes him feel better, too.
Williams recalled their first day of shooting. It was a tense scene and she felt nervous, awkward. But Segel reassured her. Soon they were riffing.
When “cut” was called, she turned to him and said, “Acting is really fun.”
He looked at her, she recalled, and thought about it for a while. And then he said, “Yeah, it really is. It’s like the funnest thing on earth.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Transforming Spaces" is a series about women driving change in sometimes unexpected places.
Marcela Guerrero had just started as a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2017 when Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, where she was born and raised.
"I was thinking, 'How can I help?"' she recalled in a recent interview. "I have an important platform. There is something I can say."'
The result is "no existe un mundo poshuracán: Puerto Rican Art in the Wake of Hurricane Maria," which opened Nov. 23 at the museum, in New York, and bills itself as "the first scholarly exhibition focused on Puerto Rican art to be organized by a large U.S. museum in nearly half a century."
Five years after becoming the Whitney's first curator specializing in Latino art, Ms. Guerrero has made a meaningful impact on the field as the nation's Hispanic population continues to grow and museums try to reflect and attract more diverse audiences.
"As the first Puerto Rican curator at the Whitney, she is at the right place at a time when Latinx art is emerging as a force to be reckoned with," said Mari Carmen Ramírez, who in 2001 became the first curator of Latin American art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, when it established a department of Latino art. "We all expect her to contribute to this transformation in a significant way."
That transformation has been noteworthy, though much of the attention around diversity has been focused on Black artists and curators in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. In a milestone, for example, the Brazilian museum director Adriano Pedrosa in December was named curator of the 2024 Venice Biennale, becoming the first Latin American to organize the world's longest-running contemporary art exhibition.
In 2021 E. Carmen Ramos, formerly head of Latino art at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, was named the chief curatorial and conservation officer at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.
In 2020, Pilar Tompkins Rivas became the chief curator and deputy director of curatorial and collections at the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles. In 2019, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art promoted Rita Gonzalez to head of contemporary art.
The Smithsonian is in the early stages of planning a National Museum of the American Latino for the National Mall, a location that members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus had urged President Biden to support.
And in 2021, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the Ford Foundation established the Latinx Artist Fellowships, awarding 15 artists $ 50,000 each.
The changes that Ms. Guerrero has helped advance at the Whitney are evident throughout the museum -- bilingual wall text and catalogs; new marketing techniques to reach diverse audiences; acquisitions and exhibitions that integrate Latino artists.
Last year, she was promoted from an assistant curator to an associate curator, an endowed position.
"She is a real visionary," Scott Rothkopf, the museum's senior deputy director and chief curator, said. "She's had a truly transformative impact on the museum in terms of the program, how we think about Latinx, around translations, around audience, around our partnerships and around who we consider our community to be."
Ms. Guerrero -- who is 42 and holds a Ph.D. in art history from the University of Wisconsin, Madison -- came to the Whitney from the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, where as a curatorial fellow she was involved in the 2017 exhibition "Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960-1985."
Before the Hammer, Ms. Guerrero worked in the Latin American and Latino art department at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, where she served as research coordinator for the International Center for the Arts of the Americas.
At the Whitney, Ms. Guerrero in 2020 helped organize "Vida Americana: Mexican Muralists Remake American Art, 1925-1945." She also curated the 2018 exhibition "Pacha, Llaqta, Wasichay: Indigenous Space, Modern Architecture, New Art," which featured the work of seven emerging Latino artists.
While some may see her as a trailblazer, Ms. Guerrero sees herself as part of a broader diversity effort underway at the Whitney and at museums around the country.
"It's about reframing how we tell the history of American art," she said. "We assume a collective responsibility about widening our scope and addressing parts of our collection we've neglected."
Ms. Guerrero said she felt the support of curators at other institutions, such as Susanna V. Temkin at El Museo del Barrio, Carmen Hermo at the Brooklyn Museum, and Vivian Crockett at the New Museum.
"I keep thinking of other people across the United States, doing the same work, from small museums to big museums," she said. "We all know each other and can count on each other."
Other curators, in turn, say they have been inspired by Ms. Guerrero. Cecilia Fajardo-Hill, an art historian and curator who organized the "Radical Women" show at the Hammer, said Ms. Guerrero's role "has been one of serious research and commitment to the fields of Latin American and Latinx art."
"Her contribution to 'Radical Women' was key, as we worked together to research Latina and Chicana artists, and she single-handedly researched Puerto Rico," Dr. Fajardo-Hill added. "Her work at the Whitney thus far has been important for promoting an expansive conceptualization of what Latinx art means today."
At the same time, Ms. Guerrero acknowledges the burden shared by many curators of color: shifting business as usual in an entrenched operation. "It means asking all the departments in an institution to do things they haven't done before, understanding what marketing to a Latinx audience means, not just doing Latinx shows," she said. "People in the Bronx also want to know about Edward Hopper or Andy Warhol."
Ms. Guerrero said real change required a "holistic approach," including diversifying the board of directors, adequately compensating the mostly Black and brown security staff members, and mentoring those coming up behind her. "How are we thinking about distribution of power," she said, "and distribution of wealth?"
"It's not lost on me that, because I am now in the hierarchy, I should empower myself to talk about these things, and I think I do," she added. "It comes from a place of care and love for the institution."
Ms. Guerrero has particularly warm memories of spending hours in the admission-free Smithsonian as a young woman when she was visiting her sister, who was working in Washington. "It was a place where I could be safe as a woman by myself, where I could reflect and think," she said. "That's my church."
She wants to share the joy she has long taken in experiencing art with a wider population, to help people who might feel intimidated by museums to feel welcome and to see themselves represented on the walls.
"The goal for me is to demystify this world because it can be so exclusive and so mysterious," she said.
To be sure, the road hasn't always been easy. Ms. Guerrero notes that her recent rise to an associate curator is her first promotion within an institution. "I had to move from city to city to be able to grow," she said. "I don't want to forget those years of being a curatorial fellow who wasn't given the time of day -- the doors you have to knock on to make space and advocate for yourself."
But the hard days are worth it, Ms. Guerrero said, and she sees encouraging signs of progress, namely that almost 25 percent of the works that the Whitney acquired in 2021 were by Latino artists.
She was also encouraged by the inclusion of a piece by Freddy Rodríguez, a Dominican immigrant, in a current exhibition at the Whitney, "In the Balance: Between Painting and Sculpture, 1965-1985," which runs through March 5, 2023. Mr. Rodríguez died on Oct. 10 at 77 of A.L.S., or Lou Gehrig's disease, just nine days shy of the show's opening.
"He said he had been in other Latinx shows, but never in a mainstream show," Ms. Guerrero said, adding, "I'll take a win -- as small as it is. That's my fuel."
She is also proud of the exhibition "no existe un mundo poshuracán" -- which takes its title from the Puerto Rican poet Raquel Salas Rivera and runs through April 23 -- featuring the work of 20 artists. The show is accompanied by series of online videos that will help contextualize the artwork.
"There's also a tremendous amount of anger and sorrow, along with much beauty," the critic Holland Cotter wrote in The New York Times, "in a carefully textured and moving show that is also among the first major surveys of contemporary Puerto Rican art in a leading United States museum in nearly 50 years."
Despite her successes so far, Ms. Guerrero doesn't seem to feel anywhere close to being able to exhale.
"It's a lot of pressure," she said. "One thing I did not expect when I came to the Whitney is to have this magnifying glass over me.
"Some parts have been very difficult, but I also see the growth," she added, "and there is hope in that."

Few Exceptions Are Approved For Abortions: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Last summer, a Mississippi woman sought an abortion after, she said, a friend had raped her. Her state prohibits most abortions but allows them for rape victims. Yet she could not find a doctor to provide one.
In September, an Indiana woman learned that a fetal defect meant her baby would die shortly after birth, if not sooner. Her state's abortion ban included an exception for such cases, but she was referred to Illinois or Michigan.
An Ohio woman carrying triplets faced a high risk of dangerous complications, including delivering too early. When she tried to get an abortion in September through Ohio's exception for patients with a medical need, she was turned away.
The abortion bans enacted in about half the states since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June do not prohibit abortion entirely. Most make exceptions in certain circumstances, commonly to protect the health or life of the patient, or in the case of rape or incest. And as conservative state lawmakers prepare to take up new restrictions on abortion in upcoming legislative sessions, exceptions will be at the heart of the debate.
But in the months since the court's decision, very few exceptions to these new abortion bans have been granted, a New York Times review of available state data and interviews with dozens of physicians, advocates and lawmakers revealed.
Instead, those with means are traveling to states where abortion is still broadly legal or are obtaining abortion pills at home because the requirements to qualify for exceptions are too steep. Doctors and hospitals are turning away patients, saying that ambiguous laws and the threat of criminal penalties make them unwilling to test the rules.
"Having the legal right on the books to get an abortion and getting one in practice are two distinctly different things," said Laurie Bertram Roberts, the executive director of the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund, a group that supports abortion rights.
An example of that disconnect is in Louisiana, which has exceptions for protecting the life or health of the patient and for deadly birth defects, and has reported zero abortions since its ban took effect. Mississippi, with exceptions for rape and protecting the life of the patient, has reported no more than two. Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri and Texas have exceptions for protecting a patient's life or health and have reported similarly low abortion figures.
There is no reliable estimate for the number of patients who seek abortions because of sexual assault or pregnancy complications, yet experts say the number is undoubtedly much more than zero. Thousands of women have most likely qualified for exceptions to state abortion bans in the months since Roe was overturned, they say.
A majority of Americans think abortion should be legal in most circumstances, and even those who otherwise oppose abortion generally support exceptions for rape and for health complications. But abortion-rights advocates say legal exceptions do nothing but make abortion bans appear more reasonable than they really are.
Abortion opponents, including those who designed the bans, say the laws are working as intended: Exceptions should be rare. If doctors are not treating patients who qualify, they say, those doctors are to blame for overinterpreting the law.
"We're not convinced there is a problem," said James Bopp, the general counsel for the National Right to Life Committee, who writes model legislation for states. "They are just trying to undermine the law in order to have it repealed."
He added: "If there is a good-faith problem, then it ought to be addressed."
Some anti-abortion lawmakers privately acknowledge the challenges that exceptions bring, but only a handful of legislators have been willing to try to revise their laws.
"We can't imagine every single circumstance that's going to happen out there. That's the problem with exceptions," said State Senator Tom Davis of South Carolina, an anti-abortion Republican who was unable to persuade colleagues this fall to broaden the exceptions in a proposed ban. "We're obligated as legislators to assess whether or not what we've done has had unintended consequences."
Obstacles to Access
Mississippi's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy was the law that challenged and led to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, touching off a wave of bans across the country. The state banned all abortions with two exceptions: one to protect the patient's life and one for rape victims.
Just before the ban took effect, Stephanie Piper, the sexual assault program manager at the Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence in Biloxi, Miss., heard from the friends of a woman who was raped and became pregnant.
The woman did not want to have the baby, Ms. Piper said. But Ms. Piper told her it would be hard to find an in-state abortion provider willing to help. Mississippi's sole abortion clinic, which had long relied on out-of-state doctors, had closed.
"Across the state, the attitude about abortion is: We don't do that here," Ms. Piper said.
Even if Mississippi still had an abortion provider, the woman probably would not have qualified for the state's rape exception. About a quarter of states that prohibit abortions include allowances for rape and incest victims, and nearly all of those, including Mississippi, require proof of an assault from a police report or a doctor's note.
The woman did not talk to law enforcement because she did not want her abuser, who had been her friend, to get in trouble, Ms. Piper said.
Anti-abortion advocates say that a police report is necessary to prove that an assault happened and to prevent providers from using the exception as a backdoor to access.
"You need detailed laws for those that don't want to obey the law," Mr. Bopp said.
Those who work with sexual assault victims say a requirement to report to law enforcement is one of the steepest barriers for those who seek abortions. About two-thirds of victims do not report to law enforcement; many know their abuser and worry about the consequences.
A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey from 2016 and 2017 found that about 15 percent of women who have been raped at some point in their lifetimes became pregnant as a result of the rape, an estimated 3.4 million women.
Ms. Piper said the Mississippi woman found a clinic appointment more than 600 miles away in Indiana. The woman and three friends pooled the several hundred dollars needed for gas, lodging and medical fees and drove together, trying to keep her spirits up.
She got the abortion just weeks before Indiana's own abortion ban briefly took effect.
Rules Unsettle Doctors
Indiana's ban was the first in the country to be written and approved after Roe fell. Many anti-abortion lawmakers felt the exceptions were written so broadly that they initially joined Democrats in opposing it, but the bill eventually passed with stricter requirements. Its exceptions include an allowance for patients whose fetuses have deadly birth defects, such as incomplete skulls or missing kidneys.
The same week the ban took effect in September, Dr. Lori Day said, she saw a patient whose OB-GYN had discovered signs of a deadly birth defect at her 20-week anatomy scan. Dr. Day, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, confirmed the diagnosis and explained that the fetus either would not survive the pregnancy or would die soon after birth.
Birth defects kill at least 6,200 babies each year between 20 weeks of pregnancy and early infancy, according to the C.D.C., though this figure does not include pregnancies that end in abortions or miscarriages.
Studies have shown that a majority of patients who discover a deadly birth defect seek an abortion. Physicians say that patients often make this choice to spare the fetus from suffering or their families from drawn-out grief.
The lawyers at Dr. Day's hospital felt that Indiana's new law prohibited the methods for the procedure and decided that they could not offer abortions because of the ban's confusing wording.
"It was messy enough that everyone was appropriately nervous," Dr. Day said.
Exceptions for fatal birth defects exist in only about a third of abortion bans. Utah, for example, allows exceptions for these abnormalities under its ban, but only if they are "universally lethal." Physicians say they rarely have such consensus.
In Louisiana, lawmakers attached a list of about two dozen conditions to their exception for fatal defects. But this summer they said they would add at least one more condition, after a woman was denied an abortion because her diagnosis was not listed.
Some members of the anti-abortion movement say these cases should not be considered abortions and that doctors should be able to terminate these pregnancies without fear.
"State lawmakers don't go into the Capitol saying we want to scare doctors," said Katie Glenn, the state policy director at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. "A lot of people are telling these doctors they need to be worried when they don't."
Most states that prohibit abortion also include an exception for patients facing severe complications, which are estimated to occur in 14 percent of pregnancies. This exception, too, is carefully narrow, and every state law that has it uses almost identical language: "to prevent a serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman."
Physicians say that they cannot anticipate all of the ways in which pregnancy can go awry and that lawmakers were wrong to assume they could. Requiring doctors to pause their care to seek legal counsel puts patients' lives at risk, they say.
In September, an Ohio woman carrying triplets faced a complicated pregnancy and delivery. Her doctors worried her health would decline and that none of the three fetuses would survive. She sought what specialists call a multifetal reduction to terminate two of them.
Multifetal reductions are typically recommended for patients carrying triplets or more, because these pregnancies are always at higher risk. The woman's maternal-fetal medicine specialist, Dr. Ellie Ragsdale, had offered these procedures regularly.
Dr. Ragsdale thought the Ohio woman was a clearcut case for the state's health exception, but her hospital's lawyers thought the threats to the patient's health were not immediate enough. (The ban has since been blocked in court.)
Dr. Ragsdale's patient traveled to Michigan for the multifetal reduction. In Indiana, Dr. Day also thought it would be simpler to refer her patient to Michigan or Illinois, rather than try to track down a willing doctor in the state.
Dr. Day said the patient told her she could not afford the travel or medical fees not covered by insurance. She did not hear from the patient again.
"What gets put out to the press is: 'We have exceptions for fetal abnormalities and we have exceptions for maternal life,' " Dr. Day said. "When you get into the nitty-gritty details of it, you actually don't."
Almost every state ban makes an exception when the pregnancy endangers the patient's life, but three states -- Idaho, North Dakota and Tennessee -- have a stricter provision. In those states, the burden is on doctors to prove the patient's life was in peril. In the other states, the burden would be on prosecutors to prove that it was not.
Tennessee's ban is the only one of the three not currently blocked by a judge, and anti-abortion advocates have held it up as a model because it is not weakened by exceptions. Now, confused and frightened doctors are asking legislators to change the law.
Bob Ramsey, a former Republican representative in Tennessee who opposes abortion, ultimately did not vote for the state's ban because it did not contain explicit exceptions. In his view, some of his colleagues ignored warnings that the law would rattle doctors.
"The confusion is actually an intent," said Mr. Ramsey, who left office after losing a primary last year. "The more confusing it is, the more likely there will be no abortion in the state of Tennessee. That's a win for people who are opposed to abortion."
Special Case, or Loophole?
Anti-abortion advocates suggest that the situation will improve as doctors realize they are unlikely to face prosecution for offering abortions as allowed under the law. There have been no known prosecutions since these laws went into effect, though few providers are testing the rules.
"Some of the doctors have been very cautious because things are not that black and white," said State Senator Regina Barrow of Louisiana, an anti-abortion Democrat who supported her state's ban. "We're going to have to do a better job to make sure they understand what is definitely allowable."
Some anti-abortion advocates say that if doctors believe the exceptions are too ambiguous, they should suggest fixes rather than criticize the laws.
"They're not trying to fix the problem," said Mr. Bopp. "I would be screaming from the housetops, 'We better amend this law to make it clear that this can be done because this is wrong.' "
But abortion-rights advocates have warned for decades that exceptions would not work in practice. They point to the rare instances of patients being granted exceptions to the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal Medicaid funding for abortion services.
And those on both sides of the issue say there may be no middle ground.
Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, who specializes in the history of abortion, said, "What would seem workable to a lot of physicians or reproductive-rights supporters would look like a loophole to the pro-life movement."
Notes: Several states have more than one abortion ban and sometimes the exceptions in those laws contradict one another. The bans chosen for this analysis are the most recent and most restrictive or have been identified by state officials as the lead ban in the state. Bans on abortion after 22 weeks of pregnancy are excluded. Georgia's ban starts at six weeks of gestation, Florida's at 15 weeks, and North Carolina's and Montana's at 20 weeks. Missouri's law includes both explicit exceptions to protect the life and health of the patient and a provision that allows for a legal defense for doctors.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A federal benefit guaranteeing free school meals to millions more students has expired as food prices have risen. Many families are feeling the pinch.
Like other parents, April Vazquez, a school nutrition specialist in Sioux Falls, S.D., is cutting coupons, buying in bulk and forgoing outings and restaurant meals. Still, a hot lunch in the school cafeteria for her three children is now a treat she has to carefully plan in her budget.
The expiration of waivers that guaranteed free school meals for nearly 30 million students across the United States during the pandemic has meant that families like Ms. Vazquez's who earn just over the income threshold no longer qualify for a federal program allowing children to eat at no cost.
As pandemic-era assistance programs lapse and inflation reaches record highs, Ms. Vazquez is hardly alone. The number of students receiving free lunches decreased by about a third, to around 18.6 million in October, the latest month with available data. In comparison, about 20.3 million students ate free in October 2019, before the pandemic. That drop can be attributed to several factors, like being on the cusp of eligibility, lack of awareness that the program had ended by the start of the school year and fewer schools participating in the program overall.
"It's just making things a hell of a lot harder at the most difficult moment that I think American families have seen in a generation," said Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president of the National Parents Union network.
For Ms. Vazquez, returning to a reality where she must pay full price for a school meal -- about $ 3 or $ 4 for each child -- is trying, and most days, her children bring a packed lunch. (Bagels, cream cheese and apples are typical; grapes and strawberries are rare because they are too expensive.)
"It's painful to know that my kids aren't going to get free or reduced," she said.
Before the pandemic, Ms. Vazquez worked part-time as a special education assistant and her children teetered between qualifying for free or reduced-price meals year to year. But when she took a full-time job as a nutritionist in August 2021, her salary was just enough to bump her family above the income threshold for either benefit: about $ 42,000 annually for free meals for a family of five and $ 60,000 for reduced-price meals.
"That was actually a worry when I applied for this position, because you don't know what's going to happen, am I going to get disqualified for this?" she said, adding that she ultimately took the job with a view toward long-term financial stability.
Even as some parents have seen their wages increase and the criteria for free and reduced-price meals expand, those boons have done little to blunt the impact of rising food costs.
From the 2019-20 school year to this school year, the income eligibility for free and reduced-price meals has increased by about 7.8 percent. Average hourly wage growth in that same period grew by 15.1 percent. Consumer prices, though, have risen by 15.4 percent, and food prices by 20.2 percent, surpassing wage growth.
In the Sioux Falls School District -- where Ms. Vazquez works and where her children attend school -- about 41 percent of children qualified for free or reduced-price lunch this school year, compared with about 49 percent before the pandemic, said its nutrition director, Gay Anderson. Some parents have remarked that they would be "better off missing half a week's work to get that free meal," she said.
"The income eligibility guidelines are just not keeping pace with inflation, and families are barely making ends meet. So what we're seeing is a lot of people are saying, 'I can't believe I don't qualify as I always did.' If they are making a dollar more, or whatever, that will do it," Ms. Anderson said.
At Wellington Exempted Village Schools in northeastern Ohio, Andrea Helton, the nutrition director, described denying the program to nearly 50 families in a school district of about 1,000 students. She recalled a single mother who lamented, "I missed the cutoff for reduced meals by $ 100 of gross income."
But Ms. Helton said, "There's nothing I can do, and it's heartbreaking."
Families are also struggling to navigate a maze of new rules or, unaware that the program had ended, contending with having to pay for meals that had once been free.
Megan, a mother of three school-aged children in Ms. Helton's district who asked to be identified only by her first name because of privacy concerns, said that she had grown accustomed to the program. So when the school pressed her for money owed for unpaid lunches, "it was a shocker."
By the end of the fall semester, she had racked up $ 136 in debt.
When Megan learned that holiday donations to the school district had wiped out that sum, "I just melted into a puddle because when you're down to that last $ 100, the last thing you want to have to worry about is whether your kids are eating or not," she said through tears.
It is difficult to estimate how many students are now going hungry. But school officials and nutrition advocates point to proxy measurements -- debt owed by families who cannot afford a school meal, for example, or the number of applications for free and reduced-price meals -- as evidence of unmet need.
In a survey released this month by the School Nutrition Association, 96.3 percent of school districts reported that meal debt had increased. Median debt rose to $ 5,164 per district through November, already higher than the $ 3,400 median reported for the entire school year in the group's 2019 survey.
At school, Ms. Vazquez described witnessing children sitting in the cafeteria with packed lunches consisting of only a bag of chips or an apple. Others have inched toward the cash register with a lunch tray, a look of fear and recognition flashing across the "kid's eyes when they see the computer, like, 'Yeah, I know I'm negative, but I want to eat,"' she said.
"You see other kids struggle and knowing, hey, I'm in the same boat," she added. "I know exactly what you're going through."
The end of universal school meals has led fewer schools to participate in the program overall: About 88 percent of public schools are operating a meal program this school year, compared with 94 percent in the previous school year, and 27.4 million children were eating a school lunch in October, compared with about 30 million in May, the last month of the school year with the program in place.
That can create a vicious cycle in which lower participation translates to higher costs per meal, forcing schools to raise the price of a meal and squeezing out even more families, said Crystal FitzSimons of the Food Research and Action Center, which routinely talks to schools about their nutrition programs.
Schools and families alike face other administrative and financial complications as school officials grapple with soaring wholesale costs and labor shortages, highlighting other challenges in increasing participation. Now officials must process paperwork to verify income eligibility, devote time and personnel for debt collection and plan ahead for expected revenue and reimbursement rates.
At Prince William County Schools in Virginia, Adam T. Russo, the nutrition director, said his office has had to dedicate more resources for outreach and education to inform parents of the policy change. Already, he relies on a multilingual staff to serve the 90,000 students in his district, one of the most diverse in the state.
For many parents, he said, the process was new and potentially confusing given that universal free meals had been in place since some of their children had started school.
"If your kid was in kindergarten, first grade, second grade, this is a completely foreign process to your family," he said. "It's been table stakes, and we've pulled the tablecloth out from under our families."
The application process, as well as the stigma associated with receiving a free or reduced-price lunch, can be prohibitive, advocates say. In 2019, even as some 29.6 million students were eligible for free or reduced-price meals, only 22 million received one, according to research. And about 20 percent of eligible households whose children did not receive either benefit reported food insecurity.
"The effort it takes to make sure these resources actually hit those kids, for what that costs, it's a hell of a lot easier to just say, listen, food is free," Ms. Rodrigues said.
The universal free school meal program pushed the federal cost of school nutrition programs from $ 18.7 billion in the 2019 fiscal year to $ 28.7 billion in the 2022 fiscal year, according to data from the Agriculture Department, which administers the program. The department does not have an official estimate of the cost of permanently enacting the policy, a spokeswoman said.
Such an initiative has drawn widespread support, with polls showing 74 percent of voters and 90 percent of parents favoring the idea, but federal enactment seems unlikely. Republican lawmakers in Congress oppose permanently extending the policy, arguing that free meals should serve only the neediest and that pandemic-era policies must eventually end.
Still, some states -- and some parents -- have been spurred to take action. For Amber Stewart, a mother of five in Duluth, Minn., the program was lifesaving.
Before the pandemic, when the family owed money for meals, her daughter would receive a cold cheese sandwich and a carton of milk, signaling to classmates she could not afford the hot meal. Stern letters demanded repayment and warned of consequences.
"Then the pandemic rolled around and everybody was eligible for the free meals, and they delivered it or you could go pick it up," said Ms. Stewart, who asked to be identified by her maiden name. "It was amazing."
Intent on seeing the program enacted permanently, Ms. Stewart is now lobbying the Minnesota legislature to adopt universal free schools meals statewide, a policy that the governor recently endorsed.
Under the new income guidelines, Ms. Stewart's children now qualify for reduced-price meals. And because of a state law that covers the fees normally owed by families in that category, they are not charged the 35 or 50 cents for breakfast or lunch.
That has been crucial, she said, because even after weekly trips to the food bank, she does not have nearly enough to get by.
"Our money is really tight," she said. "With the cost of groceries and everything, we're barely making it."

Most Abortion Bans Include Exceptions. In Practice, Few Are Granted.

Last summer, a Mississippi woman sought an abortion after, she said, a friend had raped her. Her state prohibits most abortions but allows them for rape victims. Yet she could not find a doctor to provide one.
In September, an Indiana woman learned that a fetal defect meant her baby would die shortly after birth, if not sooner. Her state’s abortion ban included an exception for such cases, but she was referred to Illinois or Michigan.
An Ohio woman carrying triplets faced a high risk of dangerous complications, including delivering too early. When she tried to get an abortion in September through Ohio’s exception for patients with a medical need, she was turned away.
The abortion bans enacted in about half the states since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June do not prohibit abortion entirely. Most make exceptions in certain circumstances, commonly to protect the health or life of the patient, or in the case of rape or incest. And as conservative state lawmakers prepare to take up new restrictions on abortion in upcoming legislative sessions, exceptions will be at the heart of the debate.
But in the months since the court’s decision, very few exceptions to these new abortion bans have been granted, a New York Times review of available state data and interviews with dozens of physicians, advocates and lawmakers revealed.
Instead, those with means are traveling to states where abortion is still broadly legal or are obtaining abortion pills at home because the requirements to qualify for exceptions are too steep. Doctors and hospitals are turning away patients, saying that ambiguous laws and the threat of criminal penalties make them unwilling to test the rules.
“Having the legal right on the books to get an abortion and getting one in practice are two distinctly different things,” said Laurie Bertram Roberts, the executive director of the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund, a group that supports abortion rights.
An example of that disconnect is in Louisiana, which has exceptions for protecting the life or health of the patient and for deadly birth defects, and has reported zero abortions since its ban took effect. Mississippi, with exceptions for rape and protecting the life of the patient, has reported no more than two. Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri and Texas have exceptions for protecting a patient’s life or health and have reported similarly low abortion figures.
There is no reliable estimate for the number of patients who seek abortions because of sexual assault or pregnancy complications, yet experts say the number is undoubtedly much more than zero. Thousands of women have most likely qualified for exceptions to state abortion bans in the months since Roe was overturned, they say.
A majority of Americans think abortion should be legal in most circumstances, and even those who otherwise oppose abortion generally support exceptions for rape and for health complications. But abortion rights advocates say legal exceptions do nothing but make abortion bans appear more reasonable than they really are.
Opponents of abortion, including those who designed the bans, say the laws are working as intended: Exceptions should be rare. If doctors are not treating patients who qualify, they say, those doctors are to blame for overinterpreting the law.
“We’re not convinced there is a problem,” said James Bopp, the general counsel for the National Right to Life Committee, who writes model legislation for states. “They are just trying to undermine the law in order to have it repealed.”
He added, “If there is a good-faith problem, then it ought to be addressed.”
Some anti-abortion lawmakers privately acknowledge the challenges that exceptions bring, but only a handful of legislators have been willing to try to revise their laws.
“We can’t imagine every single circumstance that’s going to happen out there. That’s the problem with exceptions,” said state Sen. Tom Davis of South Carolina, an anti-abortion Republican who was unable to persuade colleagues this fall to broaden the exceptions in a proposed ban. “We’re obligated as legislators to assess whether or not what we’ve done has had unintended consequences.”
Obstacles to Access, Even for Those Who Qualify
Mississippi’s ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy was the law that challenged and led to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, touching off a wave of bans across the country. The state banned all abortions with two exceptions: one to protect the patient’s life and one for rape victims.
Just before the ban took effect, Stephanie Piper, the sexual assault program manager at the Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence in Biloxi, Mississippi, heard from the friends of a woman who was raped and became pregnant.
The woman did not want to have the baby, Piper said. But Piper told her it would be hard to find an in-state abortion provider willing to help. Mississippi’s sole abortion clinic, which had long relied on out-of-state doctors, had closed.
“Across the state, the attitude about abortion is: We don’t do that here,” Piper said.
Even if Mississippi still had an abortion provider, the woman probably would not have qualified for the state’s rape exception. About one-quarter of states that prohibit abortions include allowances for rape and incest victims, and nearly all of those, including Mississippi, require proof of an assault from a police report or a doctor’s note.
The woman did not talk to law enforcement because she did not want her abuser, who had been her friend, to get in trouble, Piper said.
Anti-abortion advocates say that a police report is necessary to prove that an assault happened and to prevent providers from using the exception as a backdoor to access.
“You need detailed laws for those that don’t want to obey the law,” Bopp said.
Those who work with sexual assault victims say a requirement to report to law enforcement is one of the steepest barriers for those who seek abortions. About two-thirds of victims do not report to law enforcement; many know their abuser and worry about the consequences.
A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey from 2016 and 2017 found that about 15% of women who have been raped at some point in their lifetimes became pregnant as a result of the rape, an estimated 3.4 million women.
Piper said the Mississippi woman found a clinic appointment more than 600 miles away in Indiana. The woman and three friends pooled the several hundred dollars needed for gas, lodging and medical fees and drove together, trying to keep her spirits up.
She got the abortion just weeks before Indiana’s own abortion ban briefly took effect.
Black-and-White Rules Unsettle Doctors
Indiana’s ban was the first in the country to be written and approved after Roe fell. Many anti-abortion lawmakers felt the exceptions were written so broadly that they initially joined Democrats in opposing it, but the bill eventually passed with stricter requirements. Its exceptions include an allowance for patients whose fetuses have deadly birth defects, such as incomplete skulls or missing kidneys.
The same week the ban took effect in September, Dr. Lori Day said, she saw a patient whose OB-GYN had discovered signs of a deadly birth defect at her 20-week anatomy scan. Day, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, confirmed the diagnosis and explained that the fetus either would not survive the pregnancy or would die soon after birth.
Birth defects kill at least 6,200 babies each year between 20 weeks of pregnancy and early infancy, according to the CDC, though this figure does not include pregnancies that end in abortions or miscarriages.
Studies have shown that a majority of patients who discover a deadly birth defect seek an abortion. Physicians say that patients often make this choice to spare the fetus from suffering or their families from drawn-out grief.
The lawyers at Day’s hospital felt that Indiana’s new law prohibited the methods for the procedure and decided that they could not offer abortions because of the ban’s confusing wording.
“It was messy enough that everyone was appropriately nervous,” Day said.
Exceptions for fatal birth defects exist in only about one-third of abortion bans. Utah, for example, allows exceptions for these abnormalities under its ban, but only if they are “universally lethal.” Physicians say they rarely have such consensus.
In Louisiana, lawmakers attached a list of about two dozen conditions to their exception for fatal defects. But this summer, they said they would add at least one more condition after a woman was denied an abortion because her diagnosis was not listed.
Some members of the anti-abortion movement say these cases should not be considered abortions and that doctors should be able to terminate these pregnancies without fear.
“State lawmakers don’t go into the Capitol saying we want to scare doctors,” said Katie Glenn, the state policy director at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. “A lot of people are telling these doctors they need to be worried when they don’t.”
Most states that prohibit abortion also include an exception for patients facing severe complications, which are estimated to occur in 14% of pregnancies. This exception, too, is carefully narrow, and every state law that has it uses almost identical language: “to prevent a serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.”
Physicians say that they cannot anticipate all of the ways in which pregnancy can go awry and that lawmakers were wrong to assume they could. Requiring doctors to pause their care to seek legal counsel puts patients’ lives at risk, they say.
In September, an Ohio woman carrying triplets faced a complicated pregnancy and delivery. Her doctors worried her health would decline and that none of the three fetuses would survive. She sought what specialists call a multifetal reduction to terminate two of them.
Multifetal reductions are typically recommended for patients carrying triplets or more because these pregnancies are always at higher risk. The woman’s maternal-fetal medicine specialist, Dr. Ellie Ragsdale, had offered these procedures regularly.
Ragsdale thought the Ohio woman was a clear-cut case for the state’s health exception, but her hospital’s lawyers thought the threats to the patient’s health were not immediate enough. (The ban has since been blocked in court.)
Ragsdale’s patient traveled to Michigan for the multifetal reduction. In Indiana, Day also thought it would be simpler to refer her patient to Michigan or Illinois, rather than try to track down a willing doctor in the state.
Day said the patient told her she could not afford the travel or medical fees not covered by insurance. She did not hear from the patient again.
“What gets put out to the press is, ‘We have exceptions for fetal abnormalities, and we have exceptions for maternal life,’” Day said. “When you get into the nitty-gritty details of it, you actually don’t.”
Almost every state ban makes an exception when the pregnancy endangers the patient’s life, but three states — Idaho, North Dakota and Tennessee — have a stricter provision. In those states, the burden is on doctors to prove the patient’s life was in peril. In the other states, the burden would be on prosecutors to prove that it was not.
Tennessee’s ban is the only one of the three not currently blocked by a judge, and anti-abortion advocates have held it up as a model because it is not weakened by exceptions. Now confused and frightened doctors are asking legislators to change the law.
Bob Ramsey, a former Republican representative in Tennessee who opposes abortion, ultimately did not vote for the state’s ban because it did not contain explicit exceptions. In his view, some of his colleagues ignored warnings that the law would rattle doctors.
“The confusion is actually an intent,” said Ramsey, who left office after losing a primary last year. “The more confusing it is, the more likely there will be no abortion in the state of Tennessee. That’s a win for people who are opposed to abortion.”
A Special Case or a Loophole?
Anti-abortion advocates suggest that the situation will improve as doctors realize they are unlikely to face prosecution for offering abortions as allowed under the law. There have been no known prosecutions since these laws went into effect, though few providers are testing the rules.
“Some of the doctors have been very cautious because things are not that black and white,” said state Sen. Regina Barrow of Louisiana, an anti-abortion Democrat who supported her state’s ban. “We’re going to have to do a better job to make sure they understand what is definitely allowable.”
Some anti-abortion advocates say that if doctors believe the exceptions are too ambiguous, they should suggest fixes rather than criticize the laws.
“They’re not trying to fix the problem,” said Bopp. “I would be screaming from the housetops, ‘We better amend this law to make it clear that this can be done, because this is wrong.’”
But abortion rights advocates have warned for decades that exceptions would not work in practice. They point to the rare instances of patients being granted exceptions to the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal Medicaid funding for abortion services.
And those on both sides of the issue say there may be no middle ground.
Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis who specializes in the history of abortion, said, “What would seem workable to a lot of physicians or reproductive-rights supporters would look like a loophole to the pro-life movement.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Ruth Adler Schnee, Whose Vivid Fabrics Remade Homes, Dies at 99: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A refugee from Nazi Germany, she was among a group of designers who elevated fabric from decoration into a medium for midcentury modern design.
Ruth Adler Schnee, whose ebullient fabric designs and avant-garde home furnishings store in the heart of Detroit introduced midcentury modernism to baffled and delighted Midwesterners -- and who lived and worked long enough to have her work celebrated by a new generation of critics and design enthusiasts -- died on Jan. 5 at her home in Colorado Springs. She was 99.
Her death was announced by her son Daniel.
"Can't a cooking spoon have a beautiful shape?" asked a radio advertisement that Ms. Adler Schnee and her husband and business partner, Edward Schnee, crafted to tempt a wary public into their store, Adler Schnee. The store was a bright, glassy space showcasing Ms. Adler Schnee's boldly colored textiles, along with furniture by their friends Florence Knoll, Charles and Ray Eames, Eero Saarinen and George Nelson -- and, later, Scandinavian designs from Marimekko, Dansk and Orrefors -- all of which was at first a mystery to a public used to French provincial furniture and flowery chintzes. As she recalled one confused customer declaring early on, "Oh, you're modern. I thought you were contemporary."
It was a hard slog in the beginning: A glass teapot from the Bauhaus school took 15 years to sell. When the Eameses' color-blocked Masonite storage unit -- now a design classic -- was sneered at by customers, the couple moved it to the store's bathroom to store toilet paper, Ms. Adler Schnee noted in 2002 in an oral history interview conducted by her daughter, Anita, for the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution.
So suspicious was the establishment of this strange new aesthetic that in the early 1950s, when the couple asked their friend Minoru Yamasaki, the architect who would go on to design the World Trade Center, to design a modernist house with a print workshop for Ms. Adler Schnee, no bank would offer them a mortgage.
The couple didn't just sell these odd new objects; they wanted to teach people how to live with them. They held lunches to show off how to cook on the weird-looking Japanese barbecues they were carrying called hibachis; held workshops to introduce Finnish table settings; and published brochures with catchy titles like No More Glaring Mistakes (a tutorial on lighting), Flatware Facts and Pick Your Pots Pensively.
"Everyone thought we were crazy," Mr. Schnee told The Detroit Free Press in 1994. "Nobody wanted this crazy stuff."
"It was like walking into the future," Marsha Miro, the longtime art critic of The Free Press, said in a phone interview. "It was a revelation."
Detroit was a half-hour away from the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. Arguably the birthplace of midcentury modernism, the academy was founded as an experimental art colony and run like a freewheeling art lab by Eliel Saarinen (father of Eero), who designed its exquisite campus. Its long, glittering roster of graduates includes Ms. Knoll, the Eameses (who met there), Harry Bertoia and Ms. Adler Schnee.
Though her own work as a textile designer would become a touchstone of the era, along with the designs of Alexander Girard, Jack Lenor Larsen and others, she had not planned on designing in that medium. She had hoped to be an interior architect, and when, while still at Cranbrook, she won a competition from The Chicago Tribune to design a modern house, her entry was a glass and steel box with enormous windows, for which she sketched draperies with an abstract pattern she made up on the spot.
The competition generated a lot of buzz, and an architectural firm got in touch to ask her for the curtain designs for the car showrooms they were working on. "We can't use cabbage roses with those new car designs," she recalled being told, to which she replied, "Those designs are just a figment of my imagination; they're not on the market."
She taught herself how to silk-screen and set up a studio. But it wasn't until she met Mr. Schnee, who was newly graduated from Yale with a degree in economics, that the printing operation was able to expand.
"I fell in love with Ruth and her designs simultaneously," he told The Detroit Free Press in 1985. "It took one meeting -- about two hours -- she was a bombshell."
They married in 1948 and opened their store within a few months.
Their partnership was rare for the time: She was the designer, and he was the detail guy who ran the printing operation and the business. He named all her textiles -- monikers like Pins and Needles, Fission Chips and Seedy Weeds -- for which she found inspiration in both the natural and built worlds; her garden, the lit windows of skyscrapers, railroad yards and construction sites all made their way into her designs. She dressed as boldly as her designs, favoring rich colors like red, fuchsia and orange.
It was a moment when textiles went from being merely decorative to being a medium for contemporary design, and she was a pioneer of that crossover. Andrew Blauvelt, director of the Cranbrook Art Museum, which showed a retrospective of Ms. Adler Schnee's work in the fall of 2019, said in a phone interview that she was "one of the more important textile designers of midcentury modernism."
Ms. Adler Schnee was also a sought-after residential and commercial interior designer who worked with architects like Mr. Yamasaki, Paul Rudolph, Frank Lloyd Wright and Buckminster Fuller, as well as numerous private clients. Over her long career, she designed department stores, restaurants, health care facilities and even a Roman Catholic chapel. (The design store closed in 1977.)
The architecture and design critic Alexandra Lange, in a phone interview, described the postwar milieu in which female designers like Ms. Adler Schnee were remaking the American home.
"All these modern houses were being built, and people needed modern fabrics and furniture to put in them," Ms. Lange said. "The architecture profession was still prejudiced against women, and the areas where they were allowed to thrive were textiles and interior design -- areas which, in theory, catered to women and in which they were believed to have some innate talent."
Ruth Adler, the only daughter of Joseph and Marie (Salomon) Adler, was born on May 13, 1923, in Frankfurt, Germany, and grew up in Düsseldorf. Her father's family had an antiquarian bookstore, where he worked for a time before becoming a real estate investor. Her mother was artistic; she had studied painting at the Hans Hoffman School in Munich and calligraphy at the Bauhaus School in Weimar. Paul Klee was among the artists in the Adlers' social circle.
The family's comfortable, cultured life ended, as so many did, in the fall of 1935, when the Nuremberg Laws deprived Jewish citizens of their rights. In 1938, two days after their apartment and belongings were destroyed by the state-sanctioned mob that ransacked Jewish homes on what became known as the night of broken glass, or Kristallnacht, their father was taken to Dachau, the Nazis' first concentration camp. Surprisingly, he was released after a few months -- tens of thousands would be murdered there -- arriving home half-starved and with all his teeth knocked out.
A few days later, the Adlers were able to leave Germany, sponsored by a family in New York City and with a job promised to Joseph in Detroit. As they left Düsseldorf by train, Ruth began a diary: "Germany lies in back of us," she wrote. "Can it really be true? Is one recognized again as a human being?"
Once they had settled in Detroit, Joseph's hoped-for job did not pan out, and the whole family went to work; Joseph worked in a nursery, Marie in a mattress factory. Ruth worked in a bakery, and her brother Charles sold newspapers.
Her parents hoped she would enter diplomatic service, but Ruth wanted to be an artist. She studied interior architecture on a scholarship at the Rhode Island School of Design, graduating in 1945, and went to work briefly in Manhattan for Raymond Loewy, the influential French-born industrial designer, before earning a fellowship at Cranbrook. She graduated with an M.F.A. in 1946.
In addition to her son Daniel and her daughter, Ms. Adler Schnee is survived by another son, Jeremiah, as well as seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 2000.
When midcentury modernism began its long, slow revival in the early 1990s, Ms. Adler Schnee found herself again in the limelight, included in retrospectives like "Design 1935-1965: What Modern Was," an exhibition that toured the country in 1991 and 1992, and in the permanent collections of the Art Institute of Chicago and, later, the Henry Ford museum in Dearborn, Mich. "I've become an antique in my lifetime," she remembered telling her husband.
In 2015, the Kresge Foundation honored her with its annual Eminent Artist Award, with comes with a $ 50,000 prize. A few years earlier, at age 88, she had signed a 20-year contract with Knoll.
"I said to them, 'Do you have any idea how old I am?"' she told The Detroit Free Press. "They said that didn't matter."

Ruth Adler Schnee, whose ebullient fabric designs and avant-garde home furnishings store in the heart of Detroit introduced midcentury modernism to baffled and delighted Midwesterners — and who lived and worked long enough to have her work celebrated by a new generation of critics and design enthusiasts — died Jan. 5 at her home in Colorado Springs. She was 99.
Her death was announced by her son Daniel.
“Can’t a cooking spoon have a beautiful shape?” asked a radio advertisement that Adler Schnee and her husband and business partner, Edward Schnee, crafted to tempt a wary public into their store, Adler Schnee. The store was a bright, glassy space showcasing Adler Schnee’s boldly colored textiles, along with furniture by their friends Florence Knoll, Charles and Ray Eames, Eero Saarinen and George Nelson — and, later, Scandinavian designs from Marimekko, Dansk and Orrefors — all of which was at first a mystery to a public used to French provincial furniture and flowery chintzes. As she recalled one confused customer declaring early on, “Oh, you’re modern. I thought you were contemporary.”
It was a hard slog in the beginning: A glass teapot from the Bauhaus school took 15 years to sell. When the Eameses’ color-blocked Masonite storage unit — now a design classic — was sneered at by customers, the couple moved it to the store’s bathroom to store toilet paper, Adler Schnee noted in 2002 in an oral history interview conducted by her daughter, Anita, for the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution.
So suspicious was the establishment of this strange new aesthetic that in the early 1950s, when the couple asked their friend Minoru Yamasaki, the architect who would go on to design the World Trade Center, to design a modernist house with a print workshop for Adler Schnee, no bank would offer them a mortgage.
The couple didn’t just sell these odd new objects; they wanted to teach people how to live with them. They held lunches to show off how to cook on the weird-looking Japanese barbecues they were carrying called hibachis; held workshops to introduce Finnish table settings; and published brochures with catchy titles like No More Glaring Mistakes (a tutorial on lighting), Flatware Facts and Pick Your Pots Pensively.
“Everyone thought we were crazy,” Schnee told The Detroit Free Press in 1994. “Nobody wanted this crazy stuff.”
“It was like walking into the future,” Marsha Miro, the longtime art critic of The Free Press, said in a phone interview. “It was a revelation.”
Detroit was a half-hour away from the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Arguably the birthplace of midcentury modernism, the academy was founded as an experimental art colony and run like a freewheeling art lab by Eliel Saarinen (father of Eero), who designed its exquisite campus. Its long, glittering roster of graduates includes Knoll, the Eameses (who met there), Harry Bertoia and Adler Schnee.
Although her own work as a textile designer would become a touchstone of the era, along with the designs of Alexander Girard, Jack Lenor Larsen and others, she had not planned on designing in that medium. She had hoped to be an interior architect, and when, while still at Cranbrook, she won a competition from the Chicago Tribune to design a modern house, her entry was a glass and steel box with enormous windows, for which she sketched draperies with an abstract pattern she made up on the spot.
The competition generated a lot of buzz, and an architectural firm got in touch to ask her for the curtain designs for the car showrooms they were working on. “We can’t use cabbage roses with those new car designs,” she recalled being told, to which she replied, “Those designs are just a figment of my imagination; they’re not on the market.”
She taught herself how to silk-screen and set up a studio. But it wasn’t until she met Schnee, who was newly graduated from Yale University with a degree in economics, that the printing operation was able to expand.
“I fell in love with Ruth and her designs simultaneously,” he told The Detroit Free Press in 1985. “It took one meeting — about two hours — she was a bombshell.”
They married in 1948 and opened their store within a few months.
Their partnership was rare for the time: She was the designer, and he was the detail guy who ran the printing operation and the business. He named all her textiles — monikers like Pins and Needles, Fission Chips and Seedy Weeds — for which she found inspiration in both the natural and built worlds; her garden, the lit windows of skyscrapers, railroad yards and construction sites all made their way into her designs. She dressed as boldly as her designs, favoring rich colors like red, fuchsia and orange.
It was a moment when textiles went from being merely decorative to being a medium for contemporary design, and she was a pioneer of that crossover. Andrew Blauvelt, director of the Cranbrook Art Museum, which showed a retrospective of Adler Schnee’s work in the fall of 2019, said in a phone interview that she was “one of the more important textile designers of midcentury modernism.”

This Is Actually the End of History: [Op-Ed]

Full text: When I received my Ph.D. in history in 2013, I didn't expect that within a decade fights over history -- and historiography, even if few people use that word -- would become front-page news. But over the last few years that is precisely what has happened: Just look at the recent debates over America's legacy of slavery, what can be taught in public schools about the nation's founders and even the definition of what constitutes fascism. The interpretation of the American past has not in recent memory been as public or as contentious as it is now.
Maybe it started with The New York Times Magazine's 1619 Project, which sought to "reframe the country's history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans at the very center of our national narrative" and which accompanied a national reckoning around race. That provoked, perhaps inevitably, a right-wing backlash in the form of "The 1776 Report," a triumphalist, Donald Trump-directed effort. Then came a raft of laws in conservative-governed states across the country aiming to restrict and control how history is taught in public schools.
History, as the historian Matthew Karp has written, has become "a new kind of political priority" for people across the political spectrum, a means to fight over what it is to be an American: which values we should emphasize, which groups we should honor, which injustices we should redress.
The historical profession has likewise been roiled by controversy. Last August, James H. Sweet, the president of the American Historical Association, published an essay in which he argued that present-focused narratives of African slavery often represent "historical erasures and narrow politics." The piece engendered a firestorm of reproach, with scholars variously accusing Dr. Sweet of attempting to delegitimize new research on topics including race and gender; some even accused Dr. Sweet of outright racism.
Yet as Americans fight over their history, the historical profession itself is in rapid -- maybe even terminal -- decline. Twelve days after Dr. Sweet published his column, the A.H.A. released a "Jobs Report" that makes for grim reading: The average number of available new "tenure track" university jobs, which are secure jobs that provide living wages, benefits and stability, between 2020 and 2022 was 16 percent lower than it was for the four years before the pandemic.
The report further notes that only 27 percent of those who received a Ph.D. in history in 2017 were employed as tenure track professors four years later. The work of historians has been "de-professionalized," and people like myself, who have tenure track jobs, will be increasingly rare in coming years. This is true for all academic fields, not just history. As Adrianna Kezar, Tom DePaola and Daniel T. Scott note in their book "The Gig Academy," about 70 percent of all college professors work off the tenure track. The majority of these professors make less than $ 3,500 per course, according to a 2020 report by the American Federation of Teachers. Jobs that used to allow professors to live middle-class lives now barely enable them to keep their heads above water.
What is to blame? In the past generation the American university has undergone a drastic transformation. To reduce costs, university administrators have dramatically reduced tenure. And as the protections of tenure have withered away, the size of nonteaching university staffs have exploded. Between 1976 and 2018, "full-time administrators and other professionals employed by those institutions increased by 164 percent and 452 percent, respectively," according to a 2021 paper on the topic. Professors have been sacrificed on the altar of vice deans.
At the same time, in an effort to fund research that might redound to their financial benefit and to demonstrate their pragmatic value to politicians and to the public, universities have emphasized science, technology, engineering and math at the expense of the humanities. As the American Academy of Arts and Sciences reported, citing data from 2019, "spending for humanities research equaled 0.7 percent of the amount dedicated to STEM R.&D."
The humanities, including history, are often considered more an object of ridicule than a legitimate lane of study. Look no further than statements from politicians: Rick Scott, the former governor of Florida, assembled a task force in 2012 that recommended that people who major in history and other humanities fields be charged higher tuition at state universities. In 2016, Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky said that "French literature majors" should not receive state funding for their degrees. Even more recently, in 2021, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida mocked people who go into debt to "end up with degrees in things like zombie studies." And it's not just Republicans: President Barack Obama remarked in 2014 that "folks can make a lot more, potentially, with skilled manufacturing or the trades than they might with an art history degree," implying that if a degree didn't make money it wasn't worth it. (Mr. Obama later apologized to a University of Texas art historian for his remarks, clarifying that he did believe art history was a valuable subject.)
These material and ideological assaults have engendered a steep decline in undergraduate humanities majors. In the 2018-19 academic year, only 23,923 graduating undergraduates received degrees in history and related fields, which, the A.H.A. notes, is "down more than a third from 2012 and the smallest number awarded since the late 1980s."
Private groups, which traditionally provided significant financial support to budding humanities scholars, have taken the hint and increasingly stopped supporting the humanities and soft social sciences. The Social Science Research Council recently ended its International Dissertation Research Fellowship program, which in the last 25 years funded over 1,600 scholars exploring "non-U.S. cultures" and "U.S. Indigenous communities," declaring that the program "accomplished many of the goals it had set for itself." The Ford Foundation has similarly decided to conclude its long-running National Academies fellowship program for historically marginalized scholars in order, the foundation's president declared, "to invest more deeply in movement-building work."
It's the end of history. And the consequences will be significant.
Entire areas of our shared history will never be known because no one will receive a living wage to uncover and study them. It's implausible to expect scholars with insecure jobs to offer bold and innovative claims about history when they can easily be fired for doing so. Instead, history will be studied increasingly by the wealthy, which is to say those able to work without pay. It's easy to see how this could lead American historical scholarship to adopt a pro-status-quo bias. In today's world, if you don't have access to elite networks, financial resources or both, it just doesn't make sense to pursue a career in history. In the future, history won't just be written by the victors; it'll also be written by the well-to-do.
If Americans don't seriously invest in history and other humanities disciplines, we encourage the ahistoric ignorance upon which reaction relies. Many Republican politicians support "divisive concepts" laws that try to regulate what college professors teach. Are they aiming at an easy target in the culture war? Perhaps. But it's also true that a humanities education encourages thinking that often challenges xenophobic and racist dogma. Progress depends on studying and arguing about the past in an open and informed manner. This is especially true in a moment like our own, in which Americans use history to fight over which vision of the country will dominate politics. If there are no historians to reflect meaningfully and accurately on the past, then ignorance and hatred are sure to triumph.
Without professional historians, history education will be left more and more in the hands of social media influencers, partisan hacks and others unconcerned with achieving a complex, empirically informed understanding of the past. Take, for example, Bill O'Reilly's 12-books-and-counting "Killing" series -- the best-selling nonfiction series of all time, according to Mr. O'Reilly's publishers -- whose very framing sensationalizes the past by focusing on "the deaths and destruction of some of the most influential men and powerful nations in human history." The same could be said about Rush Limbaugh's "Rush Revere" series for young people, in which a time-traveling and tri-corner-hatted Mr. Limbaugh teaches "about some of the most exceptional Americans." Or consider Twitter, where debates over history regularly erupt -- and just as regularly devolve into name-calling. If professional historians become a thing of the past, there will be no one able to temper these types of arguments with coolheaded analysis and bring a seriousness of purpose, depth and thoughtful consideration to discussions of who Americans are and who we want to be as a nation.
Americans must do everything in their power to avert the end of history. If we don't, exaggerations, half-truths and outright lies will dominate our historical imagination and make it impossible to understand, and learn from, the past.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Cecilio Campis runs El Jefecito, a popular vendor outside The New York Times Building. 'You have to know how to treat people,' he said.
It's still dark, and Cecilio Campis is in his driveway in Jackson Heights, Queens, filling the trunk of his Ford Explorer with the day's supplies. First he loads in a large cooler stocked with bags of vegetables and sacks of seasoned pork. In the remaining space, he puts jugs of water, stacks of coffee cups and packs of paper bags.
A little after 3 a.m., he drives to a commissary in Long Island City, where vendors like him store their carts, to gather more supplies. After latching his cart to the back of his car, Mr. Campis begins the last leg of his commute, a 15-minute drive to his workplace -- a sidewalk spot outside The New York Times Building.
Mr. Campis, 47, is the proprietor of El Jefecito, one of the many food carts in Midtown Manhattan. To many New York Times employees he is Jefecito, serving coffee, breakfast and Mexican dishes just steps away from the lobby.
Vendors new and old line the perimeter of the Times Building, on the sidewalks opposite the Port Authority Bus Terminal and near entrances to the 42nd Street-Times Square subway station, the busiest station in New York. A smoothie cart showed up a few summers ago. A man who sat in a chair and sold tabloid newspapers is gone. Spring is heralded on the block by the arrival of the seasonal fruit guy.
With a steady presence, genial manner and good food, Mr. Campis has fed journalists, security guards, construction workers and tourists from his spot since 2012. It's a fine location, but more important than that: "You have to know how to treat people," he said. His way to treat people is defined by the details. An egg sandwich should contain two eggs, not one. Iced coffee, when served correctly, can be sweetened with granulated sugar like this: Spoon the desired amount of sugar into a separate cup, hit it with a splash of hot coffee, swirl and pour it in with the rest of the coffee.
Juanita Powell-Brunson, a senior operations manager at The Times, said that after the news organization moved to its current headquarters in 2007, she still got her coffee from a cart on 43rd Street, near The Times's former offices. The first winter ended that arrangement, and Ms. Powell-Brunson shopped around for a few years. Eventually, Mr. Campis showed up.
"Somebody said, 'The guy's coffee downstairs is really good. We should try it.' The rest is history," Ms. Powell-Brunson said. "Then we started getting breakfast. Then someone told me his breakfast tacos were really good. Then every day he wanted me to try something."
One early morning last August, as his rig crawled across the Queensboro Bridge to Manhattan in the dark, Mr. Campis described his work as one of the thousands of mobile food vendors in the city. He parried a reporter's reaches for the romance of street grit and only-in-New-York hustle with blunt descriptions of what he calls "the life." The life means "forget the parties, forget everything," Mr. Campis said, in order to go to bed at 8 p.m. and wake up at 3 a.m. six days a week.
Mr. Campis came to New York from Puebla, Mexico, 28 years ago and worked in restaurants. He took over El Jefecito from its previous owner in 2012, and carefully built up a menu of daily lunch specials like stuffed peppers, fish tacos and tacos al pastor. Mr. Campis said he leaped at the chance to run his own shop, even if it was 6 feet by 10 feet.
"You want to own your own stuff, be your own boss," he said.
He is often the first vendor on the block, at 4:30 a.m. Three separate bakery deliveries bring an assortment of bagels, rolls, doughnuts and croissants. Each pastry has a rightful place in the truck so Mr. Campis can fulfill orders as quickly as possible. He almost always has a co-worker to manage the griddle. Lately, the role has been filled by Mr. Campis's uncle, Ignacio Campis, who arrives before 5 a.m. to get the bacon going.
The first customers line up around 5:20 a.m., after the security guards from the Times Building drop off a few newspapers for Mr. Campis. The gesture is more symbolic than it is practical, because he insists he doesn't have time to read them.
When the tourists and office workers went home in March 2020, Mr. Campis and El Jefecito did, too. He was off the street for three months, spending time with his wife and two children, before his construction worker regulars called and asked him to return.
Business is still not back to prepandemic levels, he said. Inflation has been a pinch, too. The brown paper bags that used to cost him $ 10 are now $ 18.
"It's not like it was three years ago, but we make enough to survive," Mr. Campis said. "Not to make a little extra, but we're good."
Larry Buchanan, a Graphics editor at The Times, likes to order the mañanero ( "early riser"), a dense burrito, and skip lunch. He asks for it old style: chipotle mayonnaise without beans or salsa verde. In the summer of 2020, Mr. Buchanan decided to lend his expertise to the man who made his meals. He and other Times Graphics editors created the logo designs for two El Jefecito T shirts that Mr. Campis wears and gives to regulars.
"I had been going there every day for nine years," Mr. Buchanan said. "He never asked me my name and I never asked him his name. It was our weird little secret."
Between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m., El Jefecito rolls away. In the morning, except on Sundays, Mr. Campis will return. One day, he won't.
"After my girl graduates, I'm done," he said of his daughter in high school, who has plans to go to college. Then he hopes to start a more relaxed version of the life.
Photograph Cecilio Campis sets up his food cart, El Jefecito, in Midtown Manhattan before sunrise. Since he started in 2012, New York Times employees have become accustomed to his daily lunch specials.

Fashion Editor Provides for a Sale of the Century: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: André Leon Talley amassed piles of Louis Vuitton, Versace, Chanel and Fendi. Now it's all about to go up for auction to benefit Black churches.
André Leon Talley, the barrier-breaking Black fashion editor, was famous for his love of extravagant things and extravagant gestures. For striding through the world in a fabulous designer caftan and towering fur hat, a set of monogrammed Louis Vuitton trunks at his side as he unfurled his pronouncements: on beauty, designers, the meaning of life.
So after he died in January 2022 with no heirs, the speculation began: What would happen to the collections he had amassed over the decades and squirreled away in his homes in White Plains, N.Y., and Durham, N.C., an Aladdin's cave of artifacts that represented a certain style of luxury in the second half of the 20th and early 21st centuries?
Would they be left to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where Mr. Talley had begun his career assisting Diana Vreeland in the Costume Institute, and where he often presided over Vogue's Met Gala red carpet livestream? Would they go to the Savannah College of Art and Design, where Mr. Talley had curated Oscar de la Renta and "Little Black Dress" exhibitions? Would they be used to establish a scholarship in his name at Brown University, where he received his master's degree?
"André was very, very specific," said Alexis E. Thomas, the executor of his estate. "He left a very clear will."
And that was: Sell. Sell it (almost) all. The proceeds to be split between the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and the Mt. Sinai Missionary Baptist Church in Durham, where he grew up. Communities that represented his private life, where he had been an active (and activist) member for decades, and where he marched for change alongside.
"Basically what André did was monetize his fashion assets to secure the financial sustainability of two very important Black institutions of faith," said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation and a friend of Mr. Talley's since 1995.
Exactly what that means will be on view this week as Christie's unveils "The Collection of André Leon Talley," a 448-lot auction that will begin a three-city tour on Jan. 18 in Palm Beach, Fla., just after Martin Luther King Day. The tour will continue on to Paris (during couture) and New York (during fashion week) and culminate in a live auction of 68 lots on Feb. 15, during Black History month (the rest of the sale will open online starting Jan. 27). The timing is not coincidental.
It is to underscore the final grand gesture of an editor who was often name-checked as an inspiration by Black designers, models and editors, but who was also accused of not doing enough to force fashion's gatekeepers to face their own complicity in the industry's racism; of pandering to their bias and blindness in order to keep his most favored status and trading his intellect and knowledge for the allure of a Charvet shirt, or a Chanel tennis racket.
"André, like most of us, just wanted to be loved," Mr. Walker said. "And one of the reasons he really loved his church family is he was embraced unconditionally, and that wasn't the case in the fashion world, which sought to put him in a box of the caricature of the fashion diva." Even if it was a caricature he helped create and maintain.
"Internally he was constantly negotiating that reality," Mr. Walker said. "He had a consciousness that was informed by the history of racism and his own experience of racism both growing up and in the industry. He was a very private person and a master of compartmentalization, largely as a reaction to that. He didn't reveal himself to many beyond the news release. But on the bookshelves of his White Plains house were scholarly books on 17th-century French court dress next to first edition copies of Paul Robeson's biography and Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s history of Black America."
Both sides of Mr. Talley's life will be on view in the sale, which is, in some ways, an effort to create a bridge between the two. It will allow people to see, Ms. Thomas said, "the worlds that André did not expose." Whoopi Goldberg has written an essay for the catalog; the designer LaQuan Smith will be speaking at the Palm Beach event; and in New York the Abyssinian Baptist choir will perform.
Christie's has put a current low estimate on the sale of $ 702,200. Historically, however, personal estate auctions often far exceed the estimates because of the unquantifiable emotional dimensions involved. At the recent Joan Didion sale at Stair Galleries, for example, a pair of Céline sunglasses valued at a few hundred dollars sold for $ 27,000. At Christie's own sale of the Joan Rivers estate, a silver dog bowl engraved with her pet Spike's name estimated at $ 500- $ 800 ended up selling for more than $ 13,750. During the auction of the estate of Ronald and Nancy Reagan, a pillow valued at $ 1000 to $ 1,500 went for $ 71,250. Last year Christie's held a sale for DJ Kool Herc that ultimately brought in 226 percent more than the estimate.
"You know, we have no clue what will capture people's imagination, what will get people to bid against one another," said Elizabeth Siegel, the head of private and iconic collections at Christie's. "Will it be one of Mr. Talley's amazing caftans, or will it be a portrait of him?"
It could be one of the handful of Warhol-signed screen prints (Mr. Talley worked for Mr. Warhol at Interview after his time at the Met) or one of the many photographs by Horst P. Horst and Cecil Beaton and Louise Dahl-Wolfe. Or it could be a gold brocade caftan by Dapper Dan or one of six Prada crocodile coats. It could be a pile of colorful Versace scarves or a quilted Chanel bag; a diamond Dior watch or gold Verdura cuff links. Or a pair of Baccarat candlesticks or the African wood stools and reclining chairs that mixed it up with the gilded marble-top Louis XV console once owned by Mrs. Charles W. Engelhard, Annette de la Renta's mother. Simply sorting through the contents of Mr. Talley's two homes, Ms. Siegel said, took "a team of specialists."
"Once you went up the stairs in White Plains, you got to go into a back bedroom where there were just racks and racks of clothing," Ms. Siegel continued. "There were books stacked everywhere." Ms. Thomas talked about hundreds of pairs of shoes, sunglasses and gloves, of sketches from Karl Lagerfeld and Manolo Blahnik. (The auction comprises the majority of Mr. Talley's possessions, though a certain percentage did go to SCAD.)
Some of the lots are in better condition than others -- the Hermès drinking glasses that Mr. Talley never really used because he never entertained, for instance, and the Hermès bicycle he never rode but kept in storage at the Ritz in Paris -- but all of them share a provenance that straddles both fashion and Black history. (It is a combination that Christie's is also hoping will make the auction house relevant to a new audience.)
"I used to always say, 'André, why don't you just sell some of this stuff that you have -- you could be living like a king,"' Ms. Thomas said, a coded reference to the fact that Mr. Talley was famously bad with money, seeing it largely as a means of acquiring the things he loved rather than paying, say, a tax bill (a pattern that contributed to a dispute over the ownership of his White Plains house that was settled just after his death). "He was always saying, 'No, Alexis, that's my legacy."'
And so it will be, though perhaps not in the way anyone would have expected. Ultimately, Mr. Talley wanted his memory contained not in the objects he acquired but how he chose to dispose of them.
"That," Ms. Thomas said, "is what André wanted the world to know about who he was."

Tesla Cuts Its Prices Sharply As It Moves to Lift Demand: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The price reductions in the United States will make more of the company's electric vehicles eligible for a federal tax credit.
Tesla has cut prices on most of its electric cars in the United States and Europe by as much as 20 percent in a bid to spur slackening demand.
The automaker faces increasingly stiff competition in the global market for electric vehicles. It also must contend with rising interest rates in the United States, which have increased the cost of financing vehicle purchases.
"I think Tesla recognizes they are not the only game in town and the Detroit companies are jumping into the deep end with E.V.s," said Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst. "I think the price cuts mean Tesla is going to rip the Band-Aid off and try to go on the offensive."
Tesla stock fell sharply in early trading Friday after the price cuts were reported, but ended the day less than 1 percent lower. The share price has fallen roughly 70 percent since November 2021.
The cuts will allow some of Tesla's lower-priced models, depending on optional features, to qualify for federal tax credits of $ 7,500 that were made available starting Jan. 1 under the Inflation Reduction Act. The credit is available on electric cars priced under $ 55,000.
Tesla has enjoyed rapid growth for the last decade but now must contend with a variety of challenges, including concerns that its chief executive, Elon Musk, is too preoccupied with Twitter, the social media platform he acquired last year for $ 44 billion.
Mr. Musk has sold billions of dollars of Tesla stock to finance the Twitter acquisition, which has depressed Tesla's stock price, and he has come under fire for firing a large portion of Twitter's employees. He has also aired polarizing political views on the social media platform -- including several messages that appeared to support Russia in its war against Ukraine -- that have hurt his and Tesla's reputation with some consumers.
Tesla is not alone in dealing with slowing sales. U.S. auto sales fell about 8 percent last year to fewer than 14 million cars and trucks, the lowest level since 2011, mainly because shortages of computer chips prevented manufacturers from producing as many vehicles as consumers wanted to buy. In addition, rising borrowing rates made customer financing more expensive.
Sales of electric vehicles, however, rose 66 percent to more than 808,619, according to Kelley Blue Book, a market researcher. And while Tesla continues to dominate the segment, several automakers are gaining ground. Ford, Volkswagen and several other automakers posted sizable increases in E.V. sales last year and offer many models that were significantly more affordable than Tesla's. Hyundai and its affiliate Kia together sold more than 43,000 electric vehicles in the United States in 2022, up from a just few hundred in 2021.
New competitors are on the way, too. This year, General Motors is supposed to start making electric versions of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup and Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox sport utility vehicles.
Tesla has also had trouble in China, its largest market, where a local manufacturer, BYD, is now the No. 1 electric vehicle brand. Tesla recently lowered prices in China and reported a global sales total for 2022 that was below analysts' expectations.
While still hailed for the advanced technologies it packs into its cars, and their sleek styling, Tesla has been slow to add to its model line. It offers only four vehicles, and two are luxury models out of reach of most mainstream consumers. It last introduced a car in 2020, when the Model Y went into production.
Since 2019, Tesla has promised to introduce a pickup, called the Cybertruck, but has delayed its production several times. The company now hopes to begin making it this year. The Cybertruck has an angular, futuristic design and is expected to be sold as a luxury vehicle, which could limit its appeal. In the past, Mr. Musk has expressed a desire to produce an electric car that can sell for around $ 25,000, but he has laid out no formal plans.
In December, Tesla began delivering a small number of battery-powered semi trucks to PepsiCo, its first customer.
"We see demand problems remaining until Tesla is able to introduce a lower-priced offering in volume, which may only be in 2025," Toni Sacconaghi, a Bernstein analyst, said in a report this month.
In cutting the prices of its current models, Tesla is indicating that it is willing to concede some profit in order to increase sales volume. The company typically shows gross profit margins of 26 percent -- more than double that of some rival automakers -- a factor that led investors to bid up its stock, making it the world's most valuable car company.
The latest price cut on Tesla vehicles appeared on the company's website late Thursday. The automaker now shows a high-end Model 3 Performance compact selling in the United States for just under $ 54,000, down from $ 63,000, a cut of 14 percent.
The most affordable version of the Model 3 now sells for just under $ 44,000, a reduction of about $ 3,000 or 6 percent. The Model Y now starts at $ 53,000, a cut of 20 percent from the previous price of $ 66,000.
The company's websites for Germany, France and other European nations showed similar price cuts. The base Model 3 is now listed at 44,000 euros, a reduction of about 12 percent from the previous price.
In the past, Tesla's sales were helped by $ 7,500 tax credits provided by an earlier federal program. Those credits were no longer available after Tesla sold 200,000 vehicles in the U.S. market, but the company's sales continued to grow rapidly. Tesla has forecast that its sales will grow about 50 percent a year for the next few years.
Tesla sold 1.3 million cars in 2022, a 40 percent increase from the year before but short of the 50 percent target.
The company seemed to weather the computer chip shortage early in the pandemic better than most other automakers. Many had to idle plants temporarily at times because of shortages of certain electronic parts. Although Tesla, too, was affected, it said it was able to rewrite software that could run on substitute chips that were in more plentiful supply.
Tesla's fourth-quarter production of 440,000 cars was 34,000 more than the company delivered, suggesting that the sluggishness went beyond supply chain problems and production issues.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: To understand the rigors of the N.F.L., we asked players how they cared for their hands and feet throughout the 2022 regular season.
Over the course of the long and brutal N.F.L. season, players' feet and hands take a beating on nearly every snap. Fingers are jammed, toes are stepped on, ankles are twisted, nails are broken.
We spoke with six N.F.L. players throughout the 2022 season about how they cared for their hands and feet, essential leverage points needed for every run, block, catch and kick. Their behind-the-scenes routines were meant to help them make it through the season -- but didn't completely ward off injuries.
Will Dissly, Seattle Seahawks
Position: Tight end
N.F.L. experience: 5 seasons
Playing tight end means catching passes from the quarterback. But it also means blocking far larger defensive linemen and getting caught in the middle of piles of players, which can lead to jammed fingers, twisted ankles and other small but painful injuries.
"It's normal stuff," Dissly said about getting stepped on. "It usually hurts pretty good for 30, 60 seconds, depending on the players who stepped on you. It feels like when you stub your toe. It happens zero to three times a game. I never would come out during a game."
In mid-November, Dissly dislocated the middle finger on his right hand. He did not recall precisely when and how it happened, but he did know that he popped the joint back into place while in the hot tub after a game.
"I remember, damn, it hurt," Dissly said.
Pressed for details, Dissly said that he likely injured the finger while blocking on a running play. He reckons that he was trying to get a defender's hands off him, and his middle finger went sideways when it hit the other player.
"I'm in a hybrid position," Dissly said, referring to his role as a blocker and a receiver. "You can't really avoid it. You can't play in Bubble Wrap."
A knuckle on the finger ballooned, and he used ice for a few days to reduce the swelling. Within about two weeks, he recovered the full range of motion, though the knuckle was still large. He taped the finger to stabilize it.
"This is the time of year when your hands start hurting," Dissly said. "You just know how your body responds."
Entering the Seahawks' game with Kansas City on Christmas Eve, Dissly had set personal records for catches (33), yards (330) and first downs (19). The Seahawks were in the N.F.C. playoff hunt, too.
He added to those totals during the game, but he was banged in the knee and later placed on the injured reserve list. The injury did not necessitate surgery, but effectively ended Dissly's season.
"I wish I could finish the season now because I was feeling really, really good but football happens and you've got to respond to what happens," he said two weeks later.
"Personally, there's always stuff that I wish I could have back," Dissly said. "You know, football isn't perfect."
'When you are winning, you're feeling no pain.'
Troy Dye, Minnesota Vikings
Position: Linebacker
N.F.L. experience: 3 seasons
Dye is a throwback to the era of Willie Lanier and Dick Butkus, when linebackers were the tough men of the locker room. No pedicures for him -- he cuts his own toenails.
"No one is touching my feet," Dye said. "They got different nicks and bumps. I broke my metatarsal like when I was 8 years old, and then I tore a ligament in my ankle as a rookie."
Even as he plies his trade in the N.F.C. North, Dye, a Southern California native, refuses to wear gloves, a choice he briefly reconsidered last season after the Vikings lost a January game to the Packers in 11-degree temperatures in Green Bay, Wis.
"It wasn't fun," Dye said. "It wasn't a good decision."
Just a few days earlier, the Vikings had stunned the Buffalo Bills, 33-30, in an instant classic that ended in overtime to extend Minnesota's record to 8-1.
"When you are winning, you're feeling no pain," said Dye, who took most of his snaps with the special teams unit that day in Orchard Park, N.Y.
He had gone through more than 30 bandages a week to stave off infections from the numerous nicks and cuts on his hands. Dye said he knows the differences between being hurt and injured. He broke a thumb while at the University of Oregon that required four pins, a cast and a club for him to keep playing.
By this point in the season, Dye was spending more time in the sauna -- three or four days every week.
The bandages remained on Dye. The gloves will not come on despite approaching games in Chicago and Green Bay.
"I'm going to make it another season," Dye said.
Dye had a broken index finger, however, for most of the season. Sometimes he taped it. He did not the previous Sunday against the Lions and he felt it throbbing now.
"Sometime, I just forget about it because I'm so focused," Dye said.
Ben Jones, Tennessee Titans
Position: Center
N.F.L. experience: 11 seasons
Jones, 33, prides himself on his durability on the offensive line, where he is involved in collisions, scrums and shoving matches throughout every game. In his first 10 seasons in the league, with the Houston Texans and Tennessee Titans, he missed just one game to injury because of a concussion sustained in 2019.
"There's never an off day," he said after the Titans split the first four games of the season. "At this point in my career, I don't know what finger hasn't been dislocated or broken. I wear a glove cast on my left hand because I've damaged the ligaments in my thumb three times. On my right hand, it's been beaten up and it's been fixed up."
Jones burnished his reputation as a no-holds-barred battler when he faced the division-rival Colts in Week 7. In the fourth quarter, he helped the Titans secure a 19-10 win by pushing a pile of players that included running back Derrick Henry, who was able to get a key first down.
Jones attributes some of his success to an unusual habit of walking barefoot on the field before games, something he began doing in high school to honor his older brother, Clay, who helped raise him after their father, Steve, died.
Over the years, the walk has morphed into a reconnaissance mission.
"It started as a ritual, but now I can see if the field's wet out there or slippery, and the guys will ask me when I get back to the locker room," Jones said. "Some games, the guys need to switch cleats."
Because Jones plays in the middle, his size 15 feet are often stepped on or his ankles can roll. Before every practice and game, he runs a lacrosse ball along the bottom of his foot to loosen the muscles. Then a trainer "spats" his feet by taping the outside of his shoes to provide stability and the assurance that his laces won't come untied.
"I wear the biggest cleats with the most protection because if my feet aren't good, I'm no good," he said.
Jones's feet were the least of his worries in a victory over the Denver Broncos in Week 10, when he sustained a concussion that forced him to miss the next two games.
"I'm just happy to be back," Jones told reporters after his return. "Going through this definitely taught me some patience here. You want to be out there with your friends. They're family to me. It hurt not being out there with them."
By the time Jones returned in Week 13, the Titans were in the throes of what ended as an agonizing seven-game losing streak. Then he had a second concussion in a Week 15 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, effectively ending his season.
Zay Jones, Jacksonville Jaguars
Position: Receiver
N.F.L. experience: 6 seasons
Zay Jones was feeling very good about the young season, his first with the Jaguars after stints with the Bills and Raiders. In Week 3, he caught 10 passes for 85 yards and a touchdown in a blowout win over the Chargers.
But in practice a few days later, he was running drills and landed awkwardly, spraining an ankle and stretching the tendons in his right foot. It was bad news for a player whose job is to race downfield and cut on a dime.
Jones's ankle was so swollen that he couldn't see the tendons on his foot, but he hadn't broken any bones.
"I tried to walk on it as normal as possible," he said. "I didn't immediately put it in a boot or restrict it in any way, because I'm trying to get my mind to train my body that, 'Oh, it's going to be OK."'
Jones increased the range of motion in his foot to the point where the pain was tolerable. He did balance and weight-bearing exercises like squats and continued his normal routine of loosening the muscles on the soles of his feet with a ball.
"My mind-set was, what can I do to be ready to play?" he said. "If all I have is 80 percent, I want to make sure I can play at a high level of 80 percent."
Jones returned to the field in Week 5 in a 13-6 loss to the woeful Houston Texans. Steadily, week after week, he became one of quarterback Trevor Lawrence's favorite targets even as the team continued to lose one-score games in frustrating fashion.
"We did unfortunately lose some games that I know we want back, but we can't get those back," Jones said after the Jaguars' 21-17 loss to the Broncos, when Lawrence threw an interception on the team's final drive. The Jaguars left that game, held at Wembley Stadium in London, with a 2-6 record.
Jones had career highs of 11 catches and 145 yards in an upset of the Baltimore Ravens in late November. His emergence helped the Jaguars nudge their way into the playoff conversation.
"My ankle is feeling much better, so that's the good news," Jones said after the Jaguars beat their A.F.C. South rivals, the Tennessee Titans, in mid-December. "The bad news is I kind of got the other one banged up a little bit."
Jones said he was hurt when he stumbled into a few other players on a screen play. The injury wasn't severe, and he did not miss any games. The next week Jones caught six passes for 109 yards and three touchdowns as the Jaguars shocked the Dallas Cowboys, 40-34.
In all, Jacksonville won seven of their final nine games to capture the A.F.C. South title for the first time in five seasons.
"It's been a crazy ride for us, but it's made such a great story," Jones said. "To make it this far and be healthy is a blessing."
Braden Mann, Jets
Position: Punter
N.F.L. experience: 3 seasons
Braden Mann punts, shares kickoff duties and is the holder on field goal attempts for the Jets. His hands and feet work in concert, but he is not fussy about their maintenance.
Mann avoids leather cleats, choosing to wear cheap synthetic ones: He wants his foot to be as hard as possible when it strikes the ball. To that end, he wears a size 9 on his kicking foot even though he typically wears a size 10½.
"Game day is the hardest on my feet," Mann said. "They get abused because I pull the laces super tight. I don't want any air to get between the ball and my foot. No extra room. It won't hit my foot hard enough. After the game, you can see the indents on my feet from the laces."
Mann avoids pedicures.
"I like the calluses that I have -- inside the heel of my left foot where I push off," he said.
Mann kicks about 200 balls a week. He says he is an incessant toe and knuckle popper.
Cold, windy weather is not a punter's friend. While the Jets were off to a 6-3 start, Mann was spending extra time working on his hand-eye-foot coordination.
"When your hands are cold, they are not working as well," Mann said. "And when it's windy, you hold the ball a little longer before you drop it. I've had a few kicks that I have wanted back, so I'm spending more time on mechanics."
The Jets' late-season struggles on offense had Mann working hard: He was tied for fourth-busiest punter in the N.F.L., finishing with 83 punts.
On Nov. 20, with five seconds remaining and the Jets tied with New England, 3-3, the Patriots' Marcus Jones returned Mann's punt 84 yards, blowing by him for the game-winning touchdown. Afterward, the punter lamented leaving the ball low and short.
"It was on me," Mann said. "I didn't give the cover team a chance."
Tre' McKitty, Los Angeles Chargers
Position: Tight end
N.F.L. experience: 2 seasons
McKitty has problem digits. He suffers from turf toe on both of his big ones, and he has broken or dislocated both thumbs and every finger on either hand.
"It comes with the business," he said. "As a tight end, my hands are extremely important to me but at the same time at risk. I do a lot of blocking, and they get caught in pads and bang into helmets. I broke one thumb that way and the other on a catch."
In the off-season, McKitty does strength and grip work, but he believes holistic maintenance is the key to enduring the rigors of the season.
During the season, he gets a manicure and pedicure at least once a month and, after each practice and game, warms his hands in paraffin wax for 10 to 15 minutes to ease any pain or stiffness. He also gets a massage every Monday.
"The therapist spends a lot of time on my hands and feet," he said.
In Week 4, in early October, McKitty said he "dinged" his right wrist in a win over the Browns. But it had no impact on what he called his worst game of his career against the 49ers on Nov. 13.
McKitty is primarily a blocker who is rarely targeted by quarterback Justin Herbert. That changed when tight end Gerald Everett injured his groin in the second quarter. Herbert found McKitty with what would have been a 35-yard touchdown pass -- if he hadn't dropped it. He caught just three of his six targets, and the Chargers lost, 22-16.
"I felt awful," he said, "but I have good teammates, and they lifted me up."
The Chargers were 7-6 and just outside the playoff picture after Week 14. McKitty had developed blood blisters on his fingers.
"I forgot to cut my fingernails, and they got bent back," McKitty said.
To battle late-season fatigue, on his off days McKitty joined Chargers linebacker Kenneth Murray at a nearby swimming pool where they did underwater exercises.
"Just as important are the breathing exercises we do," McKitty said. "The point is to build stamina for a quick recovery."
"I want to be ready for a playoff run," he added.
The Chargers won their next three games, clinching a playoff spot for the first time since 2018.

Liz Robbins, 76, Lobbyist Who Broke Glass Ceiling In Washington, Is Dead: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: She founded the first woman-owned lobbying firm in the country, and made her name by supporting social policy and nonprofit causes.
Liz Robbins, who after opening the country's first woman-owned lobbying firm in 1977 became one of Washington's most successful and most beloved operators -- no easy feat for someone in her profession -- died on Saturday at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. She was 76.
Peter Corsell, a close friend, said the cause was metastatic breast cancer.
Though she carried a few major corporate clients in her portfolio, Ms. Robbins was best known for her work on behalf of social policies, like children's health care and poverty reduction, and nonprofits like the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Authors Guild.
After Congress changed the tax code in 1986 to limit the deductions available to book authors, she organized an all-star blitz on Capitol Hill, unleashing writers like David Halberstam, Christopher Buckley and J. Anthony Lukas on Congressional tax committees. Congress later walked back the change.
"Members of Congress loved her," Hilary Rosen, a lobbyist who started her career with Liz Robbins Associates, said in a phone interview. "People think of lobbyists making members of Congress do slimy things for money, whereas Liz would give them something that would make them feel good, like foster care or unemployment insurance."
One of her first efforts, in the mid-1970s, was to win federal funds to subsidize foster care and adoption in New York City. Washington was unenthusiastic about sending money to New York -- this was the era of "Ford to City: Drop Dead" -- so she arranged a coalition of like-minded governments across the country to build pressure, then argued that the funds would reduce government spending by getting children into stable homes.
At a time when female lobbyists were even rarer than female members of Congress, she prowled Capitol Hill, toting accordion files stuffed with charts and presentations, making her case one representative at a time.
"Whenever you met with Liz, you knew that she was going to be extremely well prepared, knew the issues really well and was very passionate about it," Marty Russo, a former Democratic representative from Illinois, said in a phone interview. "Liz was a rock star."
For years, every summer she held a weekend-long party at her home in East Hampton, which she playfully referred to as Congressional Camp. Mr. Russo and his family were frequent attendees, along with several other members of Congress, who might find themselves chatting with some of Ms. Robbins's many friends from outside the Beltway. Paul Newman might stop by to test out a tomato sauce recipe; Alec Baldwin might be down for basketball.
"She was a great convener of folks," Heather Podesta, a lobbyist, said by phone. "She knew the senators and members really well. They were friends that she liked, lived, played and worked with."
Ms. Robbins was especially close to Bill and Hillary Clinton, whom she and her husband, the former TV anchor Doug Johnson, met at the 1980 Democratic National Convention in Manhattan. They became fast friends: Ms. Robbins went to Arkansas to help Mrs. Clinton on child care policy, and she hosted dinners for Mr. Clinton in New York, where she introduced him to potential donors for his presidential campaign.
In 1996, Mrs. Clinton hosted a baby shower for Ms. Robbins at the White House, and Ms. Robbins was a top fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016.
After Ms. Robbins went into home hospice care in late December, the Clintons came to visit for a long dinner on Dec. 30.
"If awards were given for friendship, Liz would have swept every category over the 40 years I knew her," Mrs. Clinton said in a statement. "We supported each other through our experiences in parenting, politics, traveling, sharing Christmas visits, trading books, stories and adventures, which she was planning right up until the end of her life."
Elizabeth Jane Robbins was born on July 8, 1946, in an elevator at New York Hospital (now Cornell Weill Medical Center).
"My mother always said I was in a hurry to get where I was going, so that was perfect," she later said.
Her father, Manuel Robbins, was a lawyer who worked for a variety of city agencies, including the Manhattan district attorney's office under Thomas E. Dewey, and her mother, Eleanor (Landau) Robbins, worked in communications for the American Red Cross.
Liz grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y., studied philosophy at Wheaton College, outside of Boston, and graduated in 1967.
Along with her husband, she is survived by her daughter, Robin Johnson Tokley, and a grandson.
Ms. Robbins worked in advertising in New York and spent a stint in Washington, working for several congressional committees. She returned to New York to join a new city program centered on childhood development.
She didn't intend to go back to Washington. But she soon realized that the financially constrained city could do even more by accessing federal funds; it just had to ask. And she knew the right way to ask.
"They went broke and sent me back to Washington to do some lobbying," Ms. Robbins told the Washington newspaper Roll Call in 2005. "And so a lot of broke places started calling me up."
By 1981 she was lobbying for San Francisco, Berkeley and the state of Michigan, as well as New York City. Though she was a Democrat, she worked both parties and developed relationships with top Republican senators. During tough negotiations over a child care bill with Bob Packwood of Oregon, he challenged her to a game of gin rummy. She won $ 12, and his vote.
"She was like a snapping turtle; she wasn't going to let go," George Miller, a former Democratic representative from California, said in an interview. "One thing you learned about Lizzie, she was not going away."
By the early 2000s, Ms. Robbins was spending more and more of her time on nonprofit work. She teamed with Mr. Newman to develop SeriousFun, a network of summer camps for children with serious illnesses.
After commiserating with another close friend, the actor Alan Alda, over the inability of many scientists to engage with the general public, they corralled funding and support from Stony Brook University on Long Island to create the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science.
"I think to be a good lobbyist, you have to be an eloquent listener," she said in a 2020 interview with the journalist Pattie Sellers. "I think to be a good lobbyist, you have to be passionate and care about what you do. I know there are good lobbyists who can do it for the money. I just can't do that."

Grappling With Past, Present and Future: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At the annual meeting of the American Historical Association, the raging battle over how to write about the past -- and why -- was uncomfortably front and center.
PHILADELPHIA -- As nearly 3,000 scholars gathered over the weekend for the annual meeting of the American Historical Association, even the attempts at institutional lightheartedness carried an edge.
On a table in the crowded book exhibition, there was an invitation to vote for a slogan to be emblazoned on future swag, with candidates ranging from the earnestly inspirational ("Study the past to understand the present") to the slightly unnerving ("Historians: Look Out Behind You!").
That last one might have seemed unintentionally on the nose, and not just because the spread of legislation restricting teaching on race, gender and other "divisive concepts" has left many educators feeling like they have a target on their backs. In recent months, the association has also been roiled by its own divisive concepts -- including what constitutes "good history" to begin with.
Controversy exploded in August, when the association's president, James H. Sweet, a leading historian of the African diaspora at the University of Wisconsin, published a column in its magazine called "Is History History?," which lamented a "trend toward presentism" and a troubling politicization of scholarship.
The study of pre-modern history, Sweet wrote, is shrinking, while scholars of all periods increasingly question whether work that doesn't focus on "contemporary social justice issues" like race, gender and capitalism really matters. "The allure of political relevance, facilitated by social and other media," he argued, has encouraged "a predictable sameness" that misses the messiness and complexity of the past.
And in the public realm, Sweet (citing the New York Times's 1619 Project, the recent movie "The Woman King" and the Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade) argued that too many on both left and right treat history as "an evidentiary grab bag."
"We suffer from an overabundance of history," he wrote, "not as a method of or analysis, but as anachronistic data points for the articulation of competing politics."
The column provoked a firestorm, which spread along racial and generational fault lines. Many younger historians, consigned to poorly paid adjunct work in a radically shrinking job market, saw the out-of-touch complaints of the privileged. And for many Black scholars, it was an attack on the inherently political traditions of Black studies.
Within days, Sweet, who is white, posted a statement calling the column "clumsy" and apologizing for causing "damage" to the profession and for "alienating some of my Black colleagues and friends," but did not retract his arguments.
The continuing fracas hung over the gathering, even if few rank-and-file historians were eager to talk about it on the record.
"I think he intended it as a prick," Earl Lewis, a former president of the Mellon Foundation, said on Thursday, after an opening-night panel of five prominent scholars organized to address the controversy. "But some folks felt it as a stab."
Sweet sat near the back of the room during the panel, which was advertised under the anodyne title "The Past, the Present and the Work of Historians." Afterward, he said that he stood by both his column and his apology. But if he had to do it over, he said, "I would probably tamp down my tone."
Thursday's panel was short on pointed disagreement, and long on juxtapositions and questions, including a big one: Are the traditional methodologies extolled by Sweet an effective tool of justice and truth, or are they too enmeshed in their own racist past?
Carol Symes, an associate professor of medieval studies at the University of Illinois, said that since its inception in the 19th-century, the historical profession (including her own field) had often done "the work of injustice," bolstering empire, colonization and subjugation with "apologetics for those movements."
Rashauna Johnson, a historian of the 19th-century African diaspora at the University of Chicago, said that Black history had arisen "in response to" racist dominant narratives, in the academy and the wider world.
"To tell different stories, that aren't rooted in histories of anti-Blackness," she said, historians of Black people "have had to by default take up the cause of justice, and think of the cause of justice as deeply tied to the work of history."
Herman Bennett, a historian of Latin America and the African diaspora at the CUNY Graduate Center, agreed with Johnson, and also posed a question about Sweet's questions: "Why now?"
Disciplines like history, he said, have long been "exclusionary," treating whole swathes of humanity as having no history. The field of Black history, he said, has had to develop techniques for recovering the stories of those who left few written records.
But today, Bennet said, when the call for racial justice is reshaping the country, "these kinds of concerns, these kinds of imaginings, are suddenly questionable."
There was little reference to the widespread dismay that the field was (as a participant at another session put it) "in contraction, if not collapse." But during a lightning round of closing comments, Jane Kamensky, a historian of early America at Harvard, was blunt. "We need to talk about money," she said.
"Ford and Mellon have gotten out of the history business," she continued, referring to the two mega-foundations, which have recently ended or reduced support for graduate study and higher education generally, as part of a broader refocusing on social justice. "If the support isn't going to come from there, it certainly isn't going to come from state legislatures."
Kamensky also defended the value of "slow, patient, potentially useless" research. "We all want the vaccine," she said. "We don't want to just sit in the trenches looking at mRNA for 30 years. But if you don't spend 30 years looking at mRNA, you don't have the vaccine."
"How do we leverage the fierce urgency of now," she asked, "without being captured by it?"
That urgency was felt at various sessions on "divisive concepts" legislation, which has been proposed or passed in at least three dozen states. At one panel, K-12 educators and advocates talked about strategies for challenging such laws, which the A.H.A. has joined with more than 150 other groups in condemning as threats to "free and open exchange."
It seemed a long way from the presentism debate. But after the panel, Erin Greenwald, a historian on the recent committee to revise Louisiana's social studies standards, said historians had an obligation to do more to connect with the public.
"We live in the present," she said. "One way of getting students engaged is having them reflect on the past in a way that helps them understand what's happening."
On Friday night, Sweet delivered his presidential address, titled "Slave Trading as a Corporate Criminal Conspiracy, from the Calabar Massacre to BLM, 1767--2022," in front of a standing-room crowd.
Over an hour, he traced the story of a slave-trading family from Liverpool whose 18th-century patriarch, Ambrose Lace, had cemented his dominance over rival traders by carrying out a "gangland-style" massacre of 400 people in present-day Nigeria. Lace dodged criminal charges in Britain, and over time his family whitewashed their history, in part by selectively providing documents to historians.
In 2014, the family-founded legal services firm merged with another firm to form another carrying a name using their combined initials: BLM.
"It would be hard," Sweet said, "to think of a riper target for reparations."
Sweet then turned to the "elephant in the room," the debate over presentism. How to repair historical wrongs, he said, is an important present-day question. And historians should offer not answers but context, giving "as full a rendering of the past as our sources allow."
History, he said, "is a big tent." But he urged historians to "lean into the methodological approaches of our discipline." If not, he said, "we risk replacing one set of myths and lies with another."
Afterward, in the lobby (and on Twitter), there was hushed chatter about "doubling down," and whether Sweet's closing invocation of the Black scholar W.E.B. DuBois was "cringey."
And there was disagreement about whether genuinely open debate was really happening -- or could happen.
"People are scared to speak honestly sometimes, even what they know to be historically true, because they don't want to end up on the wrong side," Johann Neem, a historian of 19th-century education at Western Washington University, said.
Johnson, the University of Chicago scholar, sounded a cautiously optimistic note on how the controversy had been handled.
"Not to minimize what has come before," she said, "but I do think it does model something important about being able to embrace contentious, difficult conversations, in the hopes we can really figure out how to be better historians."

Full text: Davis stopped Héctor Luis García in a bout that showed his power and precision. He wants to fight Ryan Garcia next, but he also has court cases from a crash and an altercation with a woman.
After Round 8 of his bout against Gervonta Davis at Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., on Saturday night, Héctor Luis García trudged back to his corner, sat on his stool and informed his trainer that he could not see.
The temporary blindness did not result from an accident, like an inadvertent thumb in the eye. It came from Davis's power. A volley of punches late in the eighth had culminated with a left hand to García's right cheek that whiplashed his head, buckled his knees and impaired his vision.
When García refused to answer the bell for Round 9, Davis, who was born and raised in Baltimore, was declared the winner by technical knockout. He climbed to the top rope in a corner of the ring and backflipped to the canvas.
Davis, 28, emerged from bout -- and his celebration -- injury free. He is now pointed toward a high-profile showdown in April against Ryan Garcia, an undefeated lightweight with social media cachet and mainstream fame. Few active boxers are familiar enough to casual sports fans to appear in Gatorade commercials; Ryan Garcia, who is not related to Héctor García, co-stars in one with the N.B.A. star Damian Lillard.
Davis and Ryan Garcia have spoken openly about fighting this spring, but just because fans, promoters and the fighters want the bout does not mean it will happen. The long-delayed welterweight title match between Errol Spence Jr. and Terence Crawford is a case in point. Spence is now scheduled to face Keith Thurman, and the International Boxing Federation has indicated that the winner of that bout should not meet Crawford but instead face Jaron Ennis, who beat Karen Chukhadzhian in a unanimous decision on Saturday night.
An hour after Davis dispatched Héctor García, a reporter at the postfight news conference asked the boxer whom he planned to fight next, just in case plans had changed.
They had not.
"If it's up to me, Ryan's definitely next," said Davis, who is 28-0 with 26 knockouts.
From a boxing standpoint, Davis has plenty of control over his short-term future. He completed the final bout of his contract with Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s promotional company last May, and has acted as his own promoter since then. Davis, the World Boxing Association's lightweight champion, works closely with Al Haymon, the boxing power broker and head of the Premier Boxing Champions managerial outfit. But Davis has final approval over his opponents.
With the Ryan Garcia bout all but locked in, Davis agreed to a bout with Héctor García, a 31-year-old southpaw from the Dominican Republic who trains in Las Vegas. Last February, Héctor García upset a highly rated prospect named Chris Colbert to earn a shot at the World Boxing Association title in the 130-pound super featherweight division. He won that belt via unanimous decision over Roger Gutiérrez last August, then landed the bout with Davis.
Though García moved up a weight class, he entered Saturday's bout with height and reach advantages. Davis had trained for García less as a tuneup opponent than an interim challenge, and the ideal opponent to showcase Davis's tools.
"That's the type of wins I like," said Calvin Ford, Davis's trainer. "When he's putting it together, and showing his real talents."
But Davis's future also hinges on the outcome of a criminal trial, set to begin in February, on hit-and-run charges. Prosecutors in Baltimore allege that on Nov. 5, 2020, Davis ran a red light in his Lamborghini and crashed into another vehicle, injuring its four occupants. A judge in that case previously rejected a plea proposal that would have allowed Davis to avoid jail time.
Eleven days before Saturday's bout, Davis was arrested in Parkland, Fla., and charged with battery, accused of striking a woman on the side of the head. Later, his girlfriend posted on Instagram that she and Davis had an intense argument but that nobody was hurt.
"While the emotions were running high, I made an unnecessary call to law enforcement," her post read.
Davis pleaded not guilty last week.
The cases prompted Showtime's Jim Gray, the in-ring interviewer on Saturday's broadcast, to ask Davis how he could prevent derailing his own career.
"You said this week that the only one who can beat me is me. How do you avoid that happening?" Gray said.
Davis pledged to stay focused, and rely more heavily on people he trusts, like Haymon.
Inside the ring, Davis remains a reliable, efficient problem solver. After tensely contested early rounds, Davis widened his advantage with his signature style: low output, high precision, high power. García threw 345 punches, landing 55. Davis threw 239, but landed 99, including the overhand lefts late in Round 8 that compelled García to quit the fight.
"My head still hurts," García told Gray a few minutes later, during an in-ring interview. "My vision is back."
Because the current cohort of world class lightweights are fluent in social media, the buildup to and after Davis's win were riddled with online bickering.
Before the bout, Devin Haney, who holds belts from all of the major sanctioning bodies, retweeted a video of himself sparring with García, implying he had already beaten up Davis's opponent.
Just after the bout, a contender named Frank Martin tweeted the word "food" with a pair of emojis, hinting at his belief that he could feast on either Davis or García.
Ryan Garcia spent the week sniping with Davis and other fighters over Twitter, then declared he was taking future conflicts offline.
"No more talking let's get it on," he tweeted. "APRIL 15."
That would be pending Garcia's final sign-off and any developments in Davis's legal cases.

As Historians Gather, No Truce in the History Wars

PHILADELPHIA — As nearly 3,000 scholars gathered over the weekend for the annual meeting of the American Historical Association, even the attempts at institutional lightheartedness carried an edge.
On a table in the crowded book exhibition, there was an invitation to vote for a slogan to be emblazoned on future swag, with candidates ranging from the earnestly inspirational (“Study the past to understand the present”) to the slightly unnerving (“Historians: Look Out Behind You!”).
That last one might have seemed unintentionally on the nose, and not just because the spread of legislation restricting teaching on race, gender and other “divisive concepts” has left many educators feeling like they have a target on their backs. In recent months, the association has also been roiled by its own divisive concepts — including what constitutes “good history” to begin with.
Controversy exploded in August, when the association’s president, James Sweet, a leading historian of the African diaspora at the University of Wisconsin, published a column in its magazine called “Is History History?,” which lamented a “trend toward presentism” and a troubling politicization of scholarship.
The study of premodern history, Sweet wrote, is shrinking, while scholars of all periods increasingly question whether work that doesn’t focus on “contemporary social justice issues” such as race, gender and capitalism really matters. “The allure of political relevance, facilitated by social and other media,” he argued, has encouraged “a predictable sameness” that misses the messiness and complexity of the past.
And in the public realm, Sweet (citing the New York Times’ 1619 Project, the recent movie “The Woman King” and the Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade) argued that too many on both the left and the right treat history as “an evidentiary grab bag.”
“We suffer from an overabundance of history,” he wrote, “not as a method of or analysis, but as anachronistic data points for the articulation of competing politics.”
The column provoked a firestorm, which spread along racial and generational fault lines. Many younger historians, consigned to poorly paid adjunct work in a radically shrinking job market, saw the out-of-touch complaints of the privileged. And for many Black scholars, it was an attack on the inherently political traditions of Black studies.
Within days, Sweet, who is white, posted a statement calling the column “clumsy” and apologizing for causing “damage” to the profession and for “alienating some of my Black colleagues and friends,” but did not retract his arguments.
The continuing fracas hung over the gathering, even if few rank-and-file historians were eager to talk about it on the record.
“I think he intended it as a prick,” Earl Lewis, a former president of the Mellon Foundation, said Thursday, after an opening-night panel of five prominent scholars organized to address the controversy. “But some folks felt it as a stab.”
Sweet sat near the back of the room during the panel, which was advertised under the anodyne title “The Past, the Present and the Work of Historians.” Afterward, he said he stood by both his column and his apology. But if he had to do it over, he said, “I would probably tamp down my tone.”
Thursday’s panel was short on pointed disagreement and long on juxtapositions and questions, including a big one: Are the traditional methodologies extolled by Sweet an effective tool of justice and truth, or are they too enmeshed in their own racist past?

Why Did George Santos Lie About Being Jewish?: [Op-Ed]

Author: Oppenheimer, Mark

Publication info: Oppenheimer, Mark.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I know I should be horrified by the revelations about George Santos, the representative-elect from Queens who seems to have embellished or invented everything about himself except his name. But truth be told, I can't get enough of this guy.
I love that he dragged Goldman Sachs into his sordid story by putting the investment bank on his fanciful résumé. I really love that his dubious philanthropic credentials included founding Friends of Pets United, which, if a pro-animal group, raises interesting modifier questions -- Were they friends only of united pets? What about the lonely, solitary pets? -- but which actually sounds like a cult for dog lovers, one I would happily join.
And I really, really love that he claimed to have Jewish ancestry.
This was the lie that his (Catholic) grandparents were Jewish Holocaust refugees who fled to Brazil. Once the truth came out, he defended himself by telling The New York Post that he "never claimed to be Jewish" but only "Jew-ish."
But there's more that draws me to this case than Mr. Santos's way with the truth. After all, he is not the first politician to seek advantage by merely saying he is Jewish (in his case, dishonestly).
How can this be? After all, this is a time of rising antisemitism. There's a lot of bad news out there for us: the Tree of Life shooting, Ye, the hostage-taking at a Texas synagogue, the spike in attacks on observant Jews. And yet public figures still come out as public Jews.
I am reminded of the joke, purportedly told in prewar Germany, about the Jew who likes reading the Nazi newspaper. When asked why, he says that the Jewish papers carry news only about Jews being beaten and ostracized. "But in Der Stürmer, I read that we control the banks, the media, everything!"
That's what it's like to read about George Santos lying in a campaign position paper about being a "proud American Jew." He seems to think being Jewish makes you more popular! Some good news!
Still, why do it? Politicians -- by nature, canny operators all -- must sense that there is some political advantage in being identified as having Jewish heritage. And in New York, there generally is. Remember that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proudly claimed her Jewish ancestry the month after her election to Congress in 2018, when she told a Queens synagogue that "generations and generations ago" her "family consisted of Sephardic Jews."
That was mere months after Tablet magazine reported that Julia Salazar, who was running for the New York State Senate as a politically progressive Jew and claimed a mixed Jewish-Catholic background, "appears to have had a Christian upbringing." She spoke to reporters about going through a conversion to Judaism in college, around the time she became embedded deeply in New York City's robust left-Jewish community.
Gentile politicians in Arkansas are not bragging about Jewish ancestry. But in Brooklyn or Queens or out on Long Island? There are Jews, and they vote.
Jewishness -- or Jew-ish-ness? -- can bring one closer to powerful activist groups, can help give one a constituency. For Mr. Santos, having a Jewish identity made him a shinier object for the Republican Party, which for decades has been trying, and failing, to peel Jews away from the Democratic fold. (After the revelations about Mr. Santos's fibbing, the Republican Jewish Coalition said that Mr. Santos "will not be welcome at any future R.J.C. event," which hardly seems like a punishment.)
It's noteworthy that in many cases claiming to be a Jew doesn't seem to benefit, exactly -- but having a whiff of Jewish heritage or ancestry does. That stands to reason because in politics or in celebrity, there is no such thing as bad ancestry. Being 1/128th Native American or part Romani or a smidgen Jewish -- they all lend a little flavor, liven up a staid image. Actually being a current, practicing, engaged member of the group? Less appealing. A practicing, Sabbath-observant Jew makes some people suspicious; being a secular American who happens to have had a great-great-grandfather who was a shtetl rabbi is a cool biographical fact.
To quote the title of Dara Horn's essay collection, people love dead Jews. Having a dead Jew in your past is swell. George Santos invented his past in business because he hoped it would make him seem successful. He invented dead Jews to make himself seem sympathetic or interesting.
Still, I am a little wary of calling out Mr. Santos for culturally appropriating Jewishness, for trying to assimilate himself to my people, because we Jews are always trying to assimilate people to us. In the words of Adam Sandler, in his Hanukkah-song roll call of famous Jews, "Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish -- not too shabby" (and he's actually half Jewish). There's nothing a Jew likes more than welcoming to the club a celebrity with surprise Jewish ancestry.
But that's an invitation offered, tongue in cheek, by Jews. It's like the MacArthur "genius" grant: You don't apply; you just get contacted. (I'm still waiting for my phone call.) If you do want to apply, or be accepted as a member of the community, then there are many ways in -- but all of them involve being serious, not opportunistic; caring not just about your DNA or ancestry, but about the living community of Jews. You can be serious in many ways: praying with us, studying with us, learning how to cook with us, doing political organizing with us, converting to be one of us.
And for those who feel "Jew-ish," either because they had lots of Jewish friends in college or because they discovered a Jewish great-great-grandparent, even though every relative since the Civil War has been Christian: Maybe keep quiet about it? Or just say you're a friend of the Jews -- you could even found Friends of Jews United, which, like Friends of Pets United, may not exist, but definitely should.

Tesla Car Sales Grow More Slowly Than Expected, Amplifying Concerns

Tesla said Monday that deliveries in the last three months of the year rose 18% from the previous quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts and adding to pressure on Elon Musk, the company’s CEO, to focus on making cars rather than overhauling Twitter.
Tesla said it delivered 405,000 electric cars from October through December. Wall Street analysts had predicted that Tesla would sell around 420,000 vehicles, up from 343,000 vehicles in the third quarter.
The company sold a total of 1.3 million cars in 2022, a 40% increase from the year before. That was short of the 50% annual growth target Tesla had set for itself.
While the increases were impressive by auto industry standards, Tesla has become the most valuable carmaker in the world by growing at the sizzling rates more commonly associated with Silicon Valley technology companies.
In recent months, Tesla has appeared vulnerable to competition from established carmakers and to rising borrowing rates which made its electric cars more expensive for people taking out loans. Indications that Tesla is mortal have contributed to a 65% decline in Tesla shares in 2022, and led investors to focus more on conventional measures like sales and profits rather than dreams of world domination.
Fourth-quarter deliveries were below the forecasts of analysts, who had already lowered their expectations, and less than Tesla executives had suggested just a few months ago. Tesla said it produced 440,000 cars during the quarter, 34,000 more than it delivered, suggesting that supply chain problems and production woes were not the main explanation for disappointing sales.
Martin Viecha, head of investor relations at Tesla, said on Twitter that the gap between deliveries and production reflected vehicles in transit to customers.
There was no trading in New York on Monday because of the New Year’s holiday. But the numbers will probably reinforce investor fears that Musk is too focused on Twitter, which he acquired in October.
“No way to sugarcoat this,” Gary Black, managing director of the Future Fund, an investment fund, said on Twitter. He predicted that analysts would reduce their estimates of Tesla sales and profits in 2023. Tesla will report 2022 earnings on Jan. 25.
Last week, Musk tried to reassure Tesla employees, telling them not to fixate on the stock price and repeating assertions that the carmaker would become the most valuable company in the world, Reuters reported.
China, the world’s largest car market, is a big focus of investor concerns. The sharp rise of COVID-19 cases in China has weighed on demand and forced the company to periodically suspend production at its biggest factory, in Shanghai.
In addition, Chinese manufacturer BYD has raced past Tesla in electric vehicle sales in China, casting further doubt on Musk’s ability to achieve world domination in the auto industry.
The growth of Tesla sales exceeds any major rival in percentage terms. The company is also among the most profitable carmakers in the world and is ramping up new factories in Texas and Germany.
But the company faces more intense competition from traditional carmakers like Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen. Those companies have decades of experience mass producing vehicles cheaply, and some investors believe that those carmakers could catch up with Tesla more quickly than expected.
Tesla also faces softening consumer demand, partly because of rising interest rates. Wait times for Tesla models have shrunk, and the company has cut car prices in China and offered incentives to buyers in the United States.
Car buyers, especially the left-leaning, environmentally aware consumers who tend to buy electric cars, also appear to be turning away from Tesla because of Musk. His erratic behavior at Twitter and heated rhetoric on the social media platform have endeared him to conservatives and Silicon Valley executives but outraged other people.
Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has pleaded with Musk to focus his energy on Tesla, said the fourth-quarter deliveries were decent considering the difficult economic environment. “We believe this was a relatively good performance,” Ives said on Twitter.
Tesla sales could get a boost after its cars became eligible for federal incentives on Jan. 1. A new law abolished a limit on the number of vehicles from any one manufacturer that were eligible for tax credits of up to $7,500. Tesla had used up its quota.
Tesla cars made at the company’s factories in Texas and California also meet the requirement that vehicles must be manufactured in the United States, Canada or Mexico to be eligible for credits.
Musk, a prolific user of Twitter, did not immediately react to the delivery numbers Monday. On Sunday he wished his followers a “a great day 1 2023,” adding, “One thing’s for sure, it won’t be boring.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: What's Up? (Dec. 25-31)
Stranded at the Airport
Thousands of travelers were stranded in airports across the country over the holidays as Southwest Airlines canceled more than 2,900 flights on Monday and roughly 5,000 over Tuesday and Wednesday, more than 60 percent of its schedule. The disruptions were the result of staffing shortages and longstanding technological problems compounded by a fierce winter storm. Many customers said Southwest had done little or nothing to get them to their destinations. The airline's chief executive of 10 months, Bob Jordan, apologized, and the company said it had called on over 1,000 corporate employees to manually schedule crews for new flights. But Southwest's reputation is in tatters, and the scale of the chaos -- which one industry analyst called "the worst round of cancellations for any single airline" in recent memory -- has prompted the Department of Transportation to announce that it would look into whether Southwest was meeting its obligations to customers.
A Bare-Bones Twitter
As part of a series of drastic cost-cutting measures, on Christmas Eve Elon Musk sent members of his staff to a data center in Sacramento, one of Twitter's three main computing storage facilities, to disconnect servers key to keeping the site running smoothly. (And many users seemed to notice.) The company is facing eviction from its Seattle office and has cut security and janitorial services at others, with some employees bringing their own toilet paper to the increasingly bare-bones operation. Mr. Musk has also continued to conduct smaller-scale layoffs after the mass job cuts he carried out when he first took over the company in late October: He now says there are about 2,000 people working for Twitter, far fewer than the 7,500 he started with. And workers expect still more layoffs as the company faces a depressed advertising environment and increased costs, like the debt payments from Mr. Musk's purchase.
Accusations Against JPMorgan Chase
The attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands has filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase, accusing the bank of helping to conceal the exploitation of women and girls by the convicted financier Jeffrey Epstein and continuing to provide him with banking services after he pleaded guilty to sex charges in 2008. Mr. Epstein had been a client of the bank's for 15 years, including for five after his conviction; the bank ejected him in 2013. The suit, filed on Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan, described JPMorgan as "indispensable to the operation and concealment of the Epstein trafficking enterprise," arguing that the bank's delay in cutting ties with Mr. Epstein helped enable his sexual abuse. The legal filing originated in the Virgin Islands because of Mr. Epstein's illegal activities at a villa on an island in the territory, Little St. James Island, which he owned.
What's Next? (Jan. 1-7)
New Year, New S&P?
We may be able to make resolutions for more positive habits in the new year. But will the stock markets follow suit? After a tumultuous year that was its worst annual performance since 2008, some analysts believe things will start to look up for the S&P 500 in 2023. But predictions, perhaps predictably, are mixed. Some forecast a serious downturn on the horizon, while others feel optimistic that markets will lift as a result of a pivot from the Federal Reserve, which has aggressively raised rates in 2022 but could begin slowing down as inflation continues to moderate. According to Bloomberg, the average forecast for the index is that it will end the year at 4,009, which is the most bearish outlook in more than two decades. But the range of predictions -- from a low of 3,400 to a high of 4,500 -- represents an unusually wide gulf in opinion.
Incentives for E.V. Drivers
A law that takes effect Sunday will both expand and scramble the list of electric vehicles eligible for federal tax credits, including models from Ford Motor, Nissan, Volkswagen, Tesla and Volvo. Under the legislation, which is part of the climate and energy package that was approved by Congress in August, drivers of those and other eligible vehicles qualify for up to $ 7,500 in the credits. But auto industry representatives have said that the law, meant to give incentives to companies to make battery-powered vehicles and customers to buy them, comes with too many strings attached. Also confusing: Other parts of the legislation will not be carried out until March, when the Biden administration intends to add new rules devised to force carmakers to buy batteries and raw materials from domestic suppliers and trade allies.
The Latest Jobs Numbers
The last three consecutive jobs reports have been in close range. Employers added 263,000 jobs in September, 261,000 in October and 263,000 in November, a sign that despite a considerable drop-off since earlier in the year, the labor market is still strong. So far, it's been more resistant to the Fed's efforts to slow down the economy than officials would like. But on Friday, the latest data from the Labor Department could show that the Fed is starting to make a bigger dent in the jobs numbers, with analysts forecasting 200,000 new jobs in December. The Fed is aiming for a target of 100,000 jobs added per month.
What Else?
Employees at Google have so far escaped the mass layoffs sweeping the tech industry, but they are bracing for cuts. After President Biden helped impose a contract on railroad workers, some union leaders called into question his claims of being the "most pro-union president." Brian X. Chen, The Times's consumer tech columnist, predicts virtual reality and A.I. tools will become more entrenched in 2023.
