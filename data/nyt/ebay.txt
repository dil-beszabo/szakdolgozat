Full text: Powered by its connections with leagues and star athletes, the merchandising giant has entered the hobby universe with deep pockets and sharp elbows. Not everyone is happy.
On the Saturday before Thanksgiving, thousands of people filed into a dated convention center near O'Hare Airport to participate in the very American pastime of buying and selling sports trading cards.
The Chicago Sports Spectacular, one of the country's biggest and oldest card shows, is like a rummage sale from the days before eBay, but with way more money involved. The 400 or so collectibles dealers set up well-worn cardboard boxes packed with cards of various players past and present from various sports, their prices handwritten on Post-it notes: $ 45 for a Luka Doncic card, $ 100 for Zion Williamson and so on.
To get inside, collectors paid a $ 15 cash-only admission fee, then spent hours lugging briefcases and wheelies through the maze of tables stacked high with cards. They rifled through boxes and piles of merchandise looking for rare finds like signed Mickey Mantle baseballs and Michael Jordan rookie-year cards as they tried to cross items off their wish lists.
The eclectic -- some could argue eccentric -- dealers kibitzed about business trends and marveled about how quickly kids' interests were changing as groups of boys sat on the floor showing off their favorite cards.
These very analog shows have been the backbone of the multibillion-dollar hobby, as people involved call it, for decades. But this musty corner of the sports retail world may soon be completely upended.
Fanatics, which already dominates the sports merchandise world through its deals with professional leagues and its sales of replica jerseys, has entered the fray with big money, sharp elbows and Hollywood gloss, signing stars like Tom Brady and LeBron James to exclusive deals. Its aim is to entirely revamp the sports collectibles universe.
Two years ago, Fanatics reached a deal to become the exclusive trading card partner of Major League Baseball and the baseball players' union. It then bought Topps, the iconic trading card maker, for roughly $ 500 million, becoming a kingpin in an industry worth an estimated $ 44 billion, according to Verified Market Research, a data firm.
"This is an industry that's lived in the shadows for all intents and purposes, and now we're bringing a degree of prominence and relevance to it, and making it cool, fun and exciting," Mike Mahan, who leads Fanatics' Collectibles, the company's trading card division, and has been traveling to shows like the one outside Chicago, said in an interview. "We want this to be something that everyone's excited to be a part of, whether you're a collector, whether an athlete, whether you're a shop owner."
Fanatics' entry has unnerved many in the trading card universe. But Chris Keller, a longtime collector and shopkeeper in Elgin, Ill., who has attended the Chicago show for the past decade, said he had long thought the memorabilia world was ripe for disrupting.
"I said someday, somebody, an entity, a person, Mark Cuban, Elon is going to come into this hobby space and they're going to turn it upside down," he said. "And as I look around here, it's freaking me out a little bit. It's kind of surreal, to be honest."
To achieve pre-eminence in collectibles, Fanatics is using the same playbook it did to dominate the sports apparel world: purchasing key pieces of the industry ecosystem; flexing its connections with athletes, leagues and influencers; and pushing aside those it sees as impeding growth.
Fanatics works closely with sports leagues, which invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the company. It created new products with the leagues and became more of a just-in-time supplier of licensed gear, allowing it to react quickly when players emerge as stars. Growth in this merchandising business has slowed, though, one reason Fanatics is pushing into the collectibles industry, as well as sports gambling.
In the collecting world, Fanatics has tried to cut out middlemen to reduce costs. Topps now sells directly to almost 700 hobby shops, up from 180 before Fanatics bought it. Fanatics also purchased a leading card printer, GC Packaging, it says to improve quality and reliability, and bought the second-largest online marketplace for cards, PWCC.
As Fanatics consolidated the merchandise industry, scores of small shopkeepers were boxed out. Now hobby shop owners, distributors and competing card companies wonder if Fanatics will try to corner a swath of the card market so it can drive up prices. Lawsuits have ensued.
The most prominent involves Fanatics' main competitor, Panini, which has deals with the National Basketball Association and the National Football League that expire in 2025 and 2026. Before those agreements could be renewed, Fanatics swooped in to sign its own long-term deals with the leagues.
In August, Panini sued Fanatics. It claimed that having exclusive deals with the three biggest leagues -- Major League Baseball, the N.B.A. and the N.F.L. -- would stifle competition and innovation and violate antitrust laws. The Fanatics' deals mean Panini won't be able to sell cards that feature league or team logos, which could make the cards look more generic and less attractive for collectors.
"I think that in combination with everything else going on, it shows the way that Fanatics is trying to avoid competition on the merits," said David Boies, the high-profile lawyer who represents Panini and whose other clients have included Al Gore and Harvey Weinstein. Though the long-term deals involve multiple parties, Boies said, Panini chose not to sue the leagues because they remain partners with the company.
Panini also claimed that Fanatics poached its top executives in violation of their contracts and bought GC Packaging, the printer based in Allen, Texas, that Panini uses, to strangle its supply.
"Fanatics' acquisition of control over GCP has given Fanatics control of Panini's lifeblood -- the production of nearly all its trading cards," Panini said.
Fanatics denied the claim and said delivery times had improved since it bought the printer.
Fanatics countersued, accusing Panini of fraud, shoddy production and poor customer service. Fanatics said that signing long-term exclusive deals with leagues was precisely what Panini had done.
"They sued us for the very things they succeeded in doing over 15 years ago -- present a more compelling model for sports properties and win rights from the incumbents," Michael Rubin, Fanatics' founder and chief executive officer, said in a statement regarding the suit. "The industry needed significant change and innovation, and they are now viewed as antiquated."
The trash talking in court has turned into a battle of competing visions for the sports memorabilia industry, and forced everyone from manufacturers to card stores to collectors to pick a side.
"Fanatics is going to take over the world," said Michael Osacky, who appraises the condition of cards, a niche that for now is insulated from the showdown. "Some people would say maybe that's not a good thing. I think it's a good thing. I think this hobby needs innovation, new ideas. For too long, it's the same old, same old."
'There's so much innovation coming'
Card collecting may be a hobby, but it is also a fragmented industry punctuated by booms and busts. In the 1990s, manufacturers flooded the market with cards, prompting prices to collapse. In the early part of the pandemic, prices surged as collectors had more time to chase wish-list cards. The market has cooled some, but remains strong.
Some shopkeepers view Fanatics suspiciously because of its potential power, but Mr. Keller, a former radio disc jockey, has embraced the upheaval. Early to explore the digital possibilities for his trade, he's been promoting and selling cards on YouTube since 2011. Live breaking, as the practice is known, involves sellers opening cases, boxes and packs of cards online while people watch to see what's inside and perhaps purchase them during the stream. In 2020 and 2021, when many stores were shut, it became a lucrative way for entrepreneurs and card shop owners to generate revenue.
Live breaking is also among the ways Mr. Rubin hopes to transform what he sees as a staid industry. Last summer, he unveiled Fanatics Live, an online platform to compete with live breaking on YouTube, Facebook, Whatnot and others. Unlike those on other sites, breakers on Fanatics Live get boxes of cards directly from Fanatics, which also handles billing and shipping when the cards are sold, in return for a 6 percent fee from the breakers.
"The thing that I'm most excited about is the idea is three years old," Mr. Rubin, 51, said, adding that Fanatics' Collectibles generates north of $ 1 billion in revenue. "We took our first sale in '22, and we've done so much in less than two years. But I think we're like 10 percent of this journey, 20 percent of this journey. So there's so much innovation coming."
Panini's executives said some of Fanatics' contracts would last up to 20 years, long enough to freeze out competitors and leave the leagues with few alternatives. They also dispute claims that they are a tired brand unable to innovate, and claim Fanatics is benefiting from the market Panini helped build.
"We are the leaders in this space and have grown this category into what it is today," said Jason Howarth, the senior vice president of marketing at Panini, whose global revenue from trading cards topped $ 1 billion in 2022, up from $ 200 million in 2010. "We were the first trading card company to embrace case breaking when no one wanted them, and we have over 2,000 athletes, including N.B.A. M.V.P.s and Super Bowl M.V.P.s, who sign our cards."
Mr. Rubin is also creating buzz by using his extensive connections with athletes and sports leagues to promote one-of-a-kind cards that shoppers will hunt for as if they were Willy Wonka golden tickets. To that end, he hired Mr. Mahan about 18 months ago to lead Fanatics Collectibles, which includes Fanatics Live. Mr. Mahan, 47, stepped into this newly created role after running Dick Clark Productions, which produces TV award shows like the Golden Globes. An avid card collector who once weighed buying Topps or Panini himself, Mr. Mahan wants to provide cards more reliably and cheaply, and make collecting a form of entertainment that wins over newer generations.
For instance, last month, Bowman, a Topps company that Fanatics now owns, released 81 Tom Brady rookie baseball cards signed by the quarterback, who was drafted by the Montreal Expos in 1995, though he never played for the organization. (One anonymous collector has offered $ 500,000 for one of the cards.) Mr. Brady appeared in a spoof advertisement commemorating his phantom baseball career.
"This is what the industry really needed, you know?" Mr. Brady said. "There's new product innovation, getting all the Fanatics athletes involved. All the other athletes talk to me about what Fanatics is doing, and they're excited about working with them."
Getting 'Filthbomb' on their side
Fanatics also used its connections with Major League Baseball to get rookies to wear small patches on their uniforms during their debut games last season. The patches were then included in one-of-a-kind trading cards, the first 91 of which were put into packs in November.
The promotion is partly why Major League Baseball has vaulted ahead of the N.B.A. and N.F.L. in the licensed trading card market. According to one industry executive, sales of baseball cards this season are expected to hit about $ 640 million, up from $ 370 million two seasons ago, when Fanatics purchased Topps. Sales of N.B.A. and N.F.L. trading cards are expected to fall to about $ 350 million, from about $ 550 million two seasons ago.
"When you think about it, fans want a piece of players," M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred said, referring to the rookie patches. "It just seemed like an idea that could really help invigorate the business."
The league and union split royalties of about 25 percent on the sale of baseball cards. That fee has been based on the first sale of the cards, either to distributors or directly to stores. Fanatics, though, now gives the league and the union a slice of sales from live breaks, a new revenue stream.
For decades, card manufacturers have worked with independent distributors who pay them upfront for the cards. Distributors make money by reselling them at a premium to hobby shops, but athletes see none of that. Mr. Rubin wants to sell directly to stores to save them money and also have a better sense of his customers.
"Distributors have zero purpose," he said. "Can you imagine Nike and LVMH selling their merchandise to a distributor and wondering how it gets to a retail store?"
In November, Stephen Abbondandolo, who is known as Filthbomb, was the first breaker to open boxes of cards from the series that included the rookie patches. To start the two-hour-long break, Mr. Abbondandolo and his partner, John Yohe, spun a digital roulette wheel with the names of all 30 major league teams. Participants paid $ 100 or more for a team, which enabled them to get all the cards of players from that team. The person who bought the Angels, for instance, had a shot at receiving a valuable Shohei Ohtani card.
Mr. Abbondandolo hawked the last few teams while joking with collectors on the show's chat. Once every team was spoken for, he and Mr. Yohe opened packs and commented on the finds. Some cards were notable for their colorful borders. A few were signed by the player -- which enhances their value -- including one by the Yankees pitcher Gerrit Cole. Mr. Abbondandolo handed each card to Mr. Yohe, who put them in plastic protective sheaths.
The bro-like banter, accompanied by background music from AC/DC and Meek Mill, was loose and familiar, a sign that a lot of the collectors were regulars at the Filthbomb breaks. When Mr. Abbondandolo finished the break, he signed off by saying, "Sayonara, Brotanis, see you on the flip side."
Mr. Abbondandolo, 38, is among a growing group of people who turned to live breaking to stay in the hobby. Unexpectedly, the technology led him to open a hobby shop. He closed his first card shop after less than a year and in 2018 began live breaking on Facebook from his home. Mr. Abbondandolo's following steadily grew to about 3,000 collectors.
Business boomed in 2020 and 2021 when collectors were stuck at home, so he rented an office for his company, Filthbomb Breaks & Collectibles, in Glen Cove, N.Y. So many collectors started banging on his door asking to look at cards that Mr. Abbondandolo opened a showroom in front.
"So it actually turned into a store without wanting it to turn into a store," he said.
These days, he and his staff of 25 do roughly 30 breaks a day, which add up to 18 hours of streaming. In July, Filthbomb was one of the first breakers to join Fanatics Live where, Mr. Abbondandolo said, customers spend more time and money because they feel more confident that they'll receive their cards on time and in quality condition. (In his first live show, he made $ 70,000 in sales within five hours.)
He also buys regular shipments of cards directly from Fanatics, which is faster, less expensive and more reliable. It also allows him to more predictably plan his breaks. One of about 60 breakers on Fanatics Live, Mr. Abbondandolo expected to exceed $ 15 million in sales in 2023, up 25 percent from the previous year, with about 20 percent of that revenue coming from Fanatics Live.
"All of a sudden our brand equity went through the roof," he said.
The view from the hobby shops
Hobby shops, though, remain the core of the card world, and shopkeepers are adjusting to Fanatics in different ways. Mike Calvanico, who has owned a shop in Lyndhurst, N.J., for 40 years, focuses on selling boxes and cases of cards, not single cards. Success to him are card series that have high resale value. Lately, he said, Panini, not Fanatics, has issued more cards that have been a hit with his customers.
"Panini could have rolled over when Fanatics came in, but they care about the stores, the public," he said. "The guys in the production development at Panini are the ones putting food on my table."
The resale values of cards issued by Topps, he said, haven't performed as well, leaving him with smaller profits. He also was perturbed that Fanatics was signing exclusive deals with star players like Victor Wembanyama, the rookie center on the San Antonio Spurs, even though its license with the N.B.A. doesn't start for a few years. In the interim, Fanatics has issued cards with Mr. Wembanyama in street clothes, while Panini has issued unsigned Wembanyama cards.
Mr. Calvanico added that Fanatics hadn't provided enough information about its upcoming releases, which makes it hard for him to gauge customer demand.
"We're all worried about what's going to happen when they're in control of all three big leagues," he said. "Are they going to raise prices?"
Rob Veres, who owns Burbank Sports Cards, is more focused on single cards, roughly 8,000 of which are on display in his shop. Every day, three employees buy about 175 new cards and for nearly a year, he has hosted nightly livestreams with several hundred people buying cards priced from $ 10 to $ 8,000. Mr. Veres does not do live breaks, but he has sold about six million cards on eBay.
Mr. Veres, who is known as the Card Father and who plays drums in a rock band called the Cardboard Junkies, likes Fanatics' promotions that drive traffic to his store. For instance, Fanatics gave stores $ 20 for every customer who turned in cards of the current baseball M.V.P.s. The credit could then be redeemed in stores like Veres's. Fanatics has also hosted "Trade Nights," where celebrities like Brady and Kevin Hart visit stores to swap cards with customers.
"We were afraid the industry was going to age out," Mr. Veres said. "Ten, 12 years ago, for $ 60, what would a kid want, a box of cards or a video game? We were losing."
He added: "When Fanatics announced it was buying Topps, there was all kinds of dread. But they're bringing in new customers to shops."
Back in Chicago at the trading card show, many hobby shop owners told Mr. Mahan that they looked forward to seeing Fanatics bring celebrities and athletes in their doors to help draw more customers. It's one of several refrains Mr. Mahan hears while on his listening tours around the country.
At the shows, Fanatics executives have also become familiar to avid collectors like Sean Doroudian, a the founder and former chief executive of a financial services company who has spent more than $ 1 million on trading cards in the past few years. Mr. Doroudian said he started buying cards again once the pandemic started. Initially he was focused on Panini's cards because he was most interested in basketball, but stopped buying from the company after a disappointing customer service encounter.
Mr. Doroudian told Mr. Mahan that he looked forward to when Fanatics would release more basketball cards. "I can't wait and I hope for one day you guys have the licensing deal," he said.
Mr. Mahan quickly cut in.
"It's not a hope," he said.

ROSEMONT, Ill. — On the Saturday before Thanksgiving, thousands of people filed into a dated convention center near O’Hare International Airport to participate in the very American pastime of buying and selling sports trading cards.

Full text: A contingent of 1,000 Kenyan officers was intended to lead a multinational force financed by the United States to restore security in a Caribbean country terrorized by armed gangs.
A Kenyan court on Friday prohibited the deployment of 1,000 Kenyan police officers to Haiti, jeopardizing a multinational security force charged with stabilizing the chaos-hit Caribbean island nation before it even got off the ground.
The force, which is backed by the United Nations and financed by the United States, had been stalled since October, when Kenyan opponents of the mission challenged it in court, calling it unconstitutional. The High Court upheld those arguments on Friday, throwing into doubt the latest international effort to rescue an impoverished country that is spiraling ever deeper into violence and instability.
"An order is hereby issued prohibiting the deployment of police officers to Haiti or any other country," Justice Chacha Mwita said at the conclusion of a judgment that took over 40 minutes to read.
The international force was meant to help break the grip of the armed gangs that control most of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, and that have turned Haiti into one of the world's most dangerous nations. Haiti's government has pleaded for foreign military forces to restore order, but the United States and Canada have been unwilling to commit their own troops.
Kenya agreed last summer to lead the mission, with backing from Washington, which pledged $ 200 million. The force was intended to eventually increase to 3,000 security officers.
But just a handful of Caribbean nations have stepped forward to contribute police officers, and the court order on Friday raised questions about whether the mission will deploy anytime soon.
While Kenya's military has participated in numerous U.N. peacekeeping missions to countries like Liberia, Sierra Leone and Sudan, the court ruled Kenya's government had not followed correct procedure in authorizing the mission to Haiti -- although it also appeared to leave room for it to still go ahead.
The Kenyan government said it would appeal the decision.
Prime Minister Ariel Henry released a short statement saying only that he "continues diplomatic efforts with the support of the international community." His spokesman said there was no more to add.
Many Haitians were disappointed in the court decision because they were expecting the deployment to start early this year, said Allen Joseph, the program manager for Mercy Corps, an international organization operating in Haiti. But he acknowledged that opinion is mixed because the last U.N. mission did not improve Haiti's security.
"I would prefer a Haitian solution," he said.
For the Biden administration, calming the waters in Haiti is important in an election year in which migrants seeking asylum has become a political and humanitarian crisis. The number of Haitians immigrating to the United States has more than doubled in the past two years, with more than 160,000 people arriving in 2023, according to U.S. data.
The daunting task facing any mission to Haiti was highlighted by the latest violent eruption in the capital last week.
Flaming barricades sprang up across Port-au-Prince as police officers clashed with armed gangs, sending the city into lockdown as residents retreated into their homes, seeking shelter. About 24 people were killed -- not an unusual toll in a country of fewer than 12 million people where about 5,000 people died violently last year, twice as many as in 2022, and about 2,500 were kidnapped, the United Nations said this week.
Haiti's political system is teetering on the verge of collapse. Calls have been growing for the resignation of the interim prime minister, Mr. Henry, who has been in charge since the assassination in 2021 of President Jovenel Moïse.
Western officials who had been briefed on the plans for the Kenyan force said it was intended to initially comprise up to 400 officers drawn mostly from Kenya's Border Police Unit and the paramilitary General Service Unit -- officers whose work normally involves fighting Islamist militants, border smugglers and cattle rustlers.
All of that is now in doubt, even though Kenya's Parliament approved the mission in November.
The ruling also represents another rebuke to Kenya's president, William Ruto, from the country's fiercely independent higher courts, which have blocked or stalled several major policy initiatives in the past six months. (A separate court ruling, also issued on Friday, confirmed that citizens should not pay a contentious housing levy that Mr. Ruto sought to introduce.)
Those decisions have visibly angered the Kenyan president, whose prominent global image contrasts with his sinking popularity at home. He has publicly hinted that he might defy the courts, stoking worries about a wider clash between his government and the judiciary.
In his ruling on Friday, the judge said that Kenya's National Security Council was not authorized to deploy a police mission to Haiti -- something that could only happen if a "reciprocal arrangement" was in place with the Haitian government, he said.
The prohibition is also a major challenge for Mr. Ruto's relationship with the United States, the Haiti mission's main sponsor.
Since he came to power in 2022, Mr. Ruto has developed a strong relationship with the U.S. ambassador, Meg Whitman, a former chief executive officer of eBay and Hewlett-Packard. In September, soon after Kenya agreed to lead the international mission to Haiti, Ms. Whitman accompanied Mr. Ruto to California on a tour of major Silicon Valley firms like Apple, Google and Intel, hoping to attract investment in Kenya.
The Haiti mission ran into legal trouble in October when a Kenyan opposition politician brought a court challenge that resulted in an order freezing the deployment. But even as judges considered the case in recent months, the Kenyan police pressed ahead with preparations at training centers near the capital, Nairobi.
In explaining their motivations to undertake a dangerous mission in a distant country, Kenyan officials cited their country's longstanding ties with the Caribbean stretching back to their founding father, Jomo Kenyatta. Financial considerations may have played a role too: Many developing nations view international security missions as a way to subsidize or reward their security forces.
Still, many Kenyans questioned if the mission was worth it. The Kenyan public is sensitive to casualties and the deaths of Kenyan soldiers deployed to neighboring Somalia to fight Al Shabab militants often stirs vocal public opprobrium. Any further deaths from a Haiti mission could stoke criticism of Mr. Ruto's government, which is already grappling with a severe economic downturn.
The American commitment of $ 200 million, about half from the Defense Department, was intended to pay for equipment, advisers and medical support, as well as help with planning, logistics and communications, a State Department spokeswoman said. But Kenyan officials insisted that much more was needed.
Many Haitians are wary of international interventions. In 2010, a United Nations peacekeeping force brought cholera to the country as poor sanitation at a base camp sent sewage downriver, leading to over 9,000 deaths. Sexual exploitation by peacekeepers and aid workers has been documented repeatedly, and researchers say it resulted in the births of hundreds of children.
Still, the country's increasingly desperate security crisis has left many people open to another international intervention. Armed gangs regularly abduct passengers from buses, to be held for ransom. Six nuns were released on Wednesday, six days after they were kidnapped.For Haiti's demoralized, poorly supplied police force, the court decision came as yet another blow. "It's a slap in the face," Lionel Lazarre, the head of SYNAPOHA, a Haitian police union, said on Friday.
Thousands of Haitian officers have left their jobs in the past two years, leaving the force even less well equipped to battle gangs. Just 21 of its 47 armored vehicles were operational in November, a recent United Nations report found.
Mr. Lazarre said that instead of committing hundreds of millions of dollars to a Kenya-led mission, the international community should focus on building up the local police.
As international bodies and the Haiti government seek a solution, he added, "the gangs are gaining ground."

NAIROBI, Kenya — A Kenyan court on Friday prohibited the deployment of 1,000 Kenyan police officers to Haiti, jeopardizing a multinational security force charged with stabilizing the chaos-hit Caribbean island nation before it even got off the ground.

Full text: Sylvan Mishima Brackett, the chef-owner of the San Francisco restaurant Rintaro, hosted family and friends for an intimate meal to start the year.
The chef Sylvan Mishima Brackett's San Francisco izakaya, Rintaro, will turn 10 next year, and in a city crowded with good places to eat, and a state with access to spectacular ingredients year-round, it still stands out. The restaurant's courtyard, hidden from the street behind a nondescript door, is filled with fragrant fruit trees (including a persimmon and four yuzu) and in the main dining rooms, guests can watch cooks grilling skewers of chicken behind a hinoki counter or preparing glossy sashimi in the open kitchen. Brackett worked at the chef Alice Waters's farm-to-table institution Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif. -- first as her assistant and later as a creative director -- before opening his own restaurant, and he shares her commitment to seasonal and local ingredients, putting them to use in dishes informed by the food of his mother's native Japan.
Among the Japanese traditions Rintaro upholds is the making of osechi bento, handcrafted multitiered cedar boxes containing customary Japanese New Year's foods. Each December, locals can order one in advance of the holiday, knowing that it might contain delicacies such as cured steelhead trout roe and Santa Barbara spot prawns. At the very end of 2022, however, just as Rintaro's staff were putting the finishing touches on the boxes, a flood swept through the restaurant. Not only were the precious bento -- which take Brackett and his team nearly a week to prepare -- destroyed, but the restaurant sustained significant damage. (After closing for repairs, Rintaro reopened that February.)
Following that dramatic start to 2023, Brackett and his wife, Jenny Wapner, a book publisher, opted for a quiet New Year's Day celebration this year. Instead of making bento for the public, Brackett and his mother cooked a special meal for their family and close friends at Brackett and Wapner's Craftsman bungalow in Oakland. Using ingredients sourced from Japan and California (which Brackett often calls the "Westernmost prefecture of Japan"), such as wasabi from Half Moon Bay and greens from a Japanese-owned farm in Watsonville, the two prepared a feast comprising a dozen dishes -- a mix of Japanese New Year's staples and family favorites. The day began with a raucous kid-led gift exchange, and the same energy continued into the evening. After dinner, Brackett and Wapner's son suggested lighting some fireworks leftover from the Fourth of July, and everyone headed outside to welcome the New Year with flashes and bangs.
The attendees: Sylvan Mishima Brackett, 48, and Jenny Wapner, 46 -- along with their children, Louis, 10, and Vera, 5 -- hosted Brackett's mother, Toshiko Brackett, 70; his sister, the photographer Aya Brackett, 44, her husband, the film and commercial director Corey Creasey, and their two children, Miya, 9, and Niko, 4; and Virginia Haruna Vaughn, 38, the general manager of Rintaro, and her boyfriend, the art director and designer Austin Long, 34.
The table: The family-style feast was served at a long table in the home's wood-paneled dining room on vintage blue-and-white ceramic Japanese platters that Sylvan Mishima Brackett has collected from eBay and from shops and flea markets in Japan. He also used 1960s Japanese deadstock ceramic plates and wooden lacquer bowls from Mashiko, a notable pottery village in Japan, and sake cups made by Wapner's sister-in-law, Yuko Suzuki of the New York-based line Suzuki Ceramics. Wapner herself made a seasonal floral arrangement of kumquat tree branches and fragrant flowering acacia, displaying it in a large copper chalice over the fireplace.
The food: New Year's Day is the biggest holiday in Japan, and New Year's (osechi) meals date back thousands of years, traditionally including foods that are said to bring health and good luck. Because most of the dishes are prepared in advance, they tend to feature ingredients that have been preserved with sugar, salt or vinegar -- for example, pickled vegetables, preserved fish and sweet black soybeans cooked in sugar syrup. "In Japan, modern osechi will often contain roast beef or ham or cheese or fancy sausages or mini beef Wellingtons -- all sorts of special occasion foods," says Brackett. "But they always include the traditional foods, too, because it's just what you do on New Year's Day."
The meal, which Brackett and his mother prepared over two days, began with ozoni (a New Year's soup with pieces of toasted mochi in a dashi broth flavored with yuzu peel). He sourced special Santa Barbara spiny lobster, prepared dashimaki tamago (a rolled egg omelet) and assembled platters of bigeye tuna sashimi. Also on the menu: Toshiko's sticky-sweet marmalade chicken, which she always prepares for the holiday. For dessert, Haruna Vaughn brought yuzu-lemon bars featuring citrus from her mother's garden in El Cerrito, Calif.
The drinks: When the guests arrived, Brackett and Wapner served Lambrusco and Champagne for the adults, and Japanese melon cream soda for the children. With the meal, the grown-ups drank Daiginjo Junmai's Seven sake from Shirataki Sake Brewery in Yuzawa that Haruna Vaughn brought back from a recent trip to Japan.
The music: Haruna Vaughn curates Rintaro's playlists, which can be found on her Spotify profile, and she also chose the music for the meal. "I try to include a mix of artists that echo the mood of the restaurant, merging complementary ingredients from California and Japan," she says. "So there are a lot of Bay Area bands, including the Aislers Set, Shannon and the Clams, Jessica Pratt, Sonny and the Sunsets and Papercuts, alongside Japanese artists such as Yura Yura Teikoku, Shintaro Sakamoto, Yukihiro Takahashi, Haruomi Hosono and Cibo Matto."
The recipe for Toshiko Brackett's marmalade chicken (adapted from the Rintaro cookbook): Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil or another neutral oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add 16 chicken drumettes (about 450 g) and fry, turning, until browned on both sides, about 7 minutes. Pour in 1 cup of cooking sake and ½ cup of usukuchi (light-colored) shoyu, then add 4 grated garlic cloves and 1 cup of orange marmalade and stir to coat the chicken wings. Turn down the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally at the start, then more frequently as the glaze thickens to prevent scorching, until the sauce thickens to a glaze and the chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

A Quixotic Quest For Longevity Adds a Sales Pitch: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: "Ready, on three," Jamie Love said to the group of hikers as they huddled for a photo. "One, two, three ..."
"Don't die!" they shouted in unison.
The dozen or so strangers were gathered at the foot of Temescal Canyon Trail along the Pacific coast in Los Angeles on a cool Saturday morning in mid-December. Several of them, including Ms. Love, 38, who had organized the outing, wore black T-shirts with the bold white text, "DON'T DIE."
The hikers had come together with a shared goal: to extend their life spans through diet, sleep, exercise and whatever technologies might come along.
Not present was the spiritual leader of the gathering, the internet celebrity and centimillionaire tech founder turned longevity guru Bryan Johnson. In the past year, Mr. Johnson has arguably taken the lead in the race among Silicon Valley rich guys going to extremes in a quest to live forever. (Move over, Messrs. Bezos, Zuckerberg and Thiel.) Now he's turning that longevity mission -- and the online infamy he has earned because of it -- into a lifestyle business, selling supplements and prepackaged meals to less-rich people who would also like to live for a very long time. The hike, one of more than 30 "Don't Die Meet-Ups" around the world that day, was a cross between community-building and a guerrilla marketing tactic.
Mr. Johnson's deal, in a nutshell: In 2021, he began spending $ 2 million a year, by his own account, to measure every aspect of his body, from lipid levels to urination speed to brain plaque, with the goal of reversing his aging process. He called it Project Blueprint.
Every day, between 7 and 11 a.m., he eats the same three vegan meals: "Nutty Pudding" (a blend of nuts, seeds, berries and pomegranate juice), "Super Veggie" (black lentils topped with broccoli and cauliflower) and a third, rotating dish consisting of vegetables, roots and nuts. He exercises for an hour every morning and takes up to 111 pills a day. (His pharyngeal muscles may be the strongest of all.)
Mr. Johnson claims that his regimen (or "protocol," as he calls it) has already slowed his speed of aging, giving him, at 46, the maximum heart rate of a 37-year-old, the gum inflammation of a 17-year-old and the facial wrinkles of a 10-year-old, according to his website. He publicizes his test results so anyone can see images of his bowels or learn the duration of his nighttime erections. His "biological age," he claimed until recently, is 42.5, according to one measurement of changes in DNA over time known as an epigenetic clock. In other words, he has spent about three years shaving off -- maybe -- a little more than three years.
If the original goal of Project Blueprint was to perfect his health, Mr. Johnson now describes it as preparing humanity to thrive in a world dominated by artificial intelligence. Thus the new slogan: "Don't Die."
In an interview, Mr. Johnson said he didn't care what present-day people thought of him. "I'm more interested in what people of the 25th century think of me," he said. "The majority of opinions now represent the past."
Mr. Johnson has an almost Trumpian ability to stay in the news. Since 2020, he has been the subject of five articles on Bloomberg documenting his quixotic pursuits: the brain-reading helmet developed by his company Kernel; his bid to become, as he has put it elsewhere, the "most measured person in human history"; his decision to receive blood plasma from his 17-year-old son and pass his own along to his 70-year-old father; and a recent round of experimental gene therapy in Honduras. In September, Time photographed Mr. Johnson in his private gym, naked but for a carefully positioned kettlebell -- an instant meme. The New York Post has gleefully followed his every move, running more than a dozen articles on Mr. Johnson in the past year, including three about his penis.
On social media, where he has more than 700,000 combined followers on X and Instagram, he knows how to trawl for attention. He lists his stringent requirements for a romantic partner (8:30 p.m. bedtime, "no small talk," "must give plasma") and compares himself to religious figures ("Jesus fed bread and alcohol, impairing and aging/I will feed you nutrients that awake and create life"). His flat manner and uncanny looks have drawn comparisons to "American Psycho"'s Patrick Bateman, a "'Lord of the Rings' elf," a vampire and a "jacked cyborg." One podcaster called him "blood daddy." He likes to pose in crop tops.
Now, Mr. Johnson said, after three years of self-experimentation -- which he called "Phase 1" of Blueprint -- he's ready for "Phase 2": helping others replicate his process. Late last year, he began selling Blueprint-branded olive oil. This month, more products, including powdered vegetables and pill supplements, became available on his website. In conjunction with the rollout, Mr. Johnson announced a "self-experimentation study" in which participants can pay for a starter pack of Blueprint products, as well as bloodwork and other tests to track their results. The 2,500 slots filled up within 24 hours.
To his fans, who fly across the country to meet him and haunt Blueprint message boards online, this moment is an exciting opportunity to spread the Johnson gospel. Some Blueprint advocates are even building businesses of their own around his ideas. To his detractors, it's a cynical attempt to monetize his popularity. Or, worse: They call it pseudoscience that could harm the health of his followers.
The business is only one piece of the larger vision, Mr. Johnson insisted. If we can algorithmically orient the human body toward the single goal of not dying, then, he said, we can somehow extrapolate that process to the planet itself. "Climate change is an alignment problem," he said. "Replace my body with planet Earth."
So, in the meantime, why is he selling olive oil? And why are people buying it?
A Business, or a Cult?
Mr. Johnson grew up Mormon in Utah. Between college and business school, he worked for a credit card processing company selling services to businesses. His sales trick was to offer potential clients $ 100 for three minutes of their time. If they didn't sign up for his plan, they could keep the money. He quickly became the company's top salesperson.
In 2007, he founded his own payment processing company, Braintree, which acquired the startup Venmo and, in 2013, was itself acquired by eBay for $ 800 million.
A year later, Mr. Johnson got divorced and split from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. "You're born a baby again, having to answer these really important questions that don't have any answers," he said.
When I asked Mr. Johnson if he was building a religion, he said yes. "Belief systems have proven to be stronger than countries, or companies, or anything else," for helping humans reach goals, he said. "Every religion has been trying to offer a solution to 'Don't die' -- that's the product they've generated," he added.
In conversations about Blueprint, it's hard to avoid the word cult. Mr. Johnson himself likes to joke: "Is this some sick and twisted cult trying to get me to go to bed on time?"
Jeff Tang, who recently started a Blueprint-based meal prep company in the San Francisco area, said a lot of businesses "feel like cults at the beginning," citing WeWork as an example.
Mr. Johnson's acolytes fall into two general categories: the health and wellness seekers, and the tech crowd, which in recent years has become preoccupied with longevity.
Many Blueprint-curious attendees at the Los Angeles hike said they cared less about maximizing their life span than their "health span," or healthy years. Some found the predictability of Mr. Johnson's plan appealing.
"Self-control and discipline -- he just takes it out of the equation," said Sirish Pulusani, 40, who works at a longevity-based health clinic. He wore an Oura ring, a Whoop bracelet and an Apple Watch -- all of which track bodily metrics.
Theresa Cowan, 36, said she wanted to eat natural food like Mr. Johnson's, which she believes could have healing properties, as opposed to fast food, which "is creating death to our cells." Ms. Cowan, who has worked as an actress and singer, brought her children Makayla and Samuel, 8 and 5, on the hike. She said she and Makayla planned to adopt the Blueprint protocol and make videos about it. ("You'd want to be particularly cautious about this for anyone under 18," said Dr. George Kuchel, a professor of medicine at University of Connecticut who studies aging.)
Ms. Cowan added that she didn't give her children vaccines or antibiotics. "I live my life against the grain," she said.
A number of meet-up participants shared stories of trauma, often health-related. Mr. Pulusani grew up with a severe case of eczema. Ms. Cowan's husband has a tumor in his bladder, and she hopes to persuade him to adopt the Blueprint way of life in order to heal, she said.
Four hundred miles up the coast, about 50 people -- mostly young, mostly men -- gathered on the same day for a Blueprint hike starting at Rockaway Beach south of San Francisco. It was a tech-y group: A former employee of Elon Musk's brain implant company, Neuralink, was there, as were a handful of founders from Y Combinator, the start-up incubator. (One person who couldn't make it threw himself a Blueprint-themed birthday party in San Francisco the next night, with olive oil shots and blood bags full of passion fruit tea.) Mr. Tang, the organizer, carried along a cardboard cutout of Mr. Johnson's famous kettlebell photo.
Before the group set off, Mr. Tang gathered everyone on a grassy patch and posed a series of icebreaker questions, including whether they'd want to live forever. About half the attendees said yes.
The Scientific Community Has Concerns
Mr. Johnson occupies an odd place in the field of longevity research, which has attracted a surge of investment in recent years. If there's a spectrum between scientific rigor and pure marketing, many experts argue Mr. Johnson is on the promotional end.
Dr. Nir Barzilai, a professor of medicine and genetics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and scientific director of the American Federation for Aging Research, has spent years studying healthy seniors he calls "super-agers" and has identified several genetic markers associated with longevity. He said he appreciated Mr. Johnson's bringing attention to the longevity field.
"But is he contributing to it in a scientific way?" Dr. Barzilai asked. "The answer is no."
For starters, he said, Mr. Johnson's methodology is far from the one accepted by the scientific community for a century: clinical studies with large groups of people, some with treatment and others with a placebo, ideally double-blind. (What Mr. Johnson described to me as his new "clinical trial" is ... not that.) And Mr. Johnson, to date, has experimented only on himself.
"Even if it works with him -- which I don't think it does -- this unique person has unique genetics that probably are not applicable to a population," Dr. Barzilai said.
Dr. Barzilai also questioned Mr. Johnson's decision to adopt so many different interventions at once, making it impossible to determine cause and effect -- not to mention creating a risk of harmful interactions among treatments.
According to Dr. Barzilai, Mr. Johnson sometimes conflates markers of health, like lung capacity, with markers of aging. "The fact that he's doing better at things he's trained for doesn't make the rest of his body younger," he said. Similarly, other markers that Mr. Johnson measures may correlate with age but haven't been shown to cause aging or de-aging.
Dr. Barzilai was not particularly impressed with Mr. Johnson's results, either. He himself is taking only metformin, a diabetes drug whose life-extending potential he has studied, and doing intermittent fasting, which has been shown to improve the life span of mice but not humans. But when Dr. Barzilai, 68, met Mr. Johnson at a conference in 2023, they took a blood test and got similar results: "We were both about three years younger than our age," he said.
Experts are also skeptical of Mr. Johnson's supplements regimen. Valter Longo, professor of gerontology and biological sciences at the University of Southern California, said taking a large amount of supplements risked adverse interactions.
"Some supplements may give you the nutrients you're missing, but a lot, particularly in high doses, are likely to interfere with normal physiology and eventually do more damage than good," he said.
Andrew Steele, a biologist and an author who writes about longevity, said there was no evidence that Mr. Johnson's products would help people live longer. "None of them has slam-dunk human data saying this supplement or additive will improve life span," he said.
A University at Buffalo dietitian, Danielle Meyer, said Mr. Johnson's diet would be hard for many women to adopt. (Blueprint's female chief marketing officer followed the full regimen for 90 days but has since switched to a less intense routine.) "Our life stages have different needs," Ms. Meyer said. "Women of childbearing age, menopause -- all these factors make it more complicated in females than in males."
She also questioned the sustainability of the Blueprint program, pointing to research showing that rigid diets are difficult to maintain. (Mr. Johnson restricts his daily calories to 2,250, rather than the 3,000 that his body mass and exercise regime suggest he needs.)
Mr. Johnson acknowledges that it can be hard to tease apart the variables in his regimen, and that the changes he's measuring with biomarkers have not been proved to cause aging or reverse it. But he dismisses experts who criticize him, calling them the "longevity mafia."
Achieving scientific consensus is slow, he said: "You'll die before you get that."
An Ugly Legal Battle
In December, Mr. Johnson posted a video on YouTube titled "My Ex-Fiancée Sued Me for $ 9,000,000," in which he responded to a lawsuit that the filmmaker and former actress Taryn Southern had filed after they separated in 2019. In a 2021 complaint, Ms. Southern claimed that Mr. Johnson had withheld money he owed her for work, and that after their breakup -- after Ms. Southern was diagnosed with cancer -- Mr. Johnson had failed to follow through on a promise to pay her rent and expenses for a year. Ms. Southern sought at least $ 1 million in damages.
Mr. Johnson denied all accusations and contested the lawsuit. An arbitrator decided that Ms. Southern was bound by a separation agreement she previously signed, in which she forfeited her right to sue Mr. Johnson. The arbitrator ultimately ordered Ms. Southern to pay Mr. Johnson's legal fees.
In his YouTube video, Mr. Johnson framed the lawsuit as a shakedown -- Ms. Southern's lawyers had originally sought $ 9 million in a letter -- and an example of "the dark underground accusation economy." (Ms. Southern, who is bound by a nondisclosure clause in the separation agreement, declined to comment.)
A December article in Vanity Fair highlighted Ms. Southern's side of the story. After she got cancer, Mr. Johnson called her a "bad deal" and a "net negative," according to the complaint. Ms. Southern's account portrays Mr. Johnson as emotionally manipulating her and dangling the prospect of stock options in one of his companies to pressure her into signing the separation agreement.
Mr. Johnson dismisses the Vanity Fair piece and critical threads about his behavior on X as "one-sided," as they rely on Ms. Southern's version of events. In an interview, he said that the anecdotes in the lawsuit were "entirely fabricated." So far, he has declined to respond to Ms. Southern's specific claims, arguing that it wouldn't change people's minds.
When I asked about the perception that he was controlling, Mr. Johnson told me that after his previous marriage had ended messily, he had insisted on having Ms. Southern -- who also worked for his companies -- sign agreements stipulating the terms of their arrangement for the sake of clarity.
"It had nothing to do with control, and everything to do with relationship hygiene," Mr. Johnson said.
Blueprinters I spoke with said the case had not changed their opinion of Mr. Johnson. "I just scrolled right by it," Ms. Love said. "It's not something I want to put into my consciousness."
The Blueprint Stack
Mr. Johnson calls his new bundle of products the "Blueprint Stack" -- a coding reference that, like "protocol," evokes the metaphor of human body as computer and life as algorithm.
Offerings include powdered versions of Nutty Pudding and Super Veggie, cocoa powder, and a dried mixture of nuts and blueberries. He is also selling a "Longevity Blend Micronutrient Drink Mix (Blood Orange Flavor)," which includes the supplement creatine and the New Age-favorite shrub ashwagandha, plus four different pill products, which altogether represent a simplified version of his 100-plus pill regimen. As a wink to his skeptics, he plans to rebrand his olive oil as "Snake Oil."
The current basic package costs $ 333 a month, but that covers only about 400 calories a day. Mr. Johnson said he planned to offer enough products to account for a person's entire daily calorie intake for less than $ 1,000 a month. (Adults typically need between 1,600 and 3,000 calories a day.)
"We're trying to compete for the most nutritious food program in history," he said. "Like, so good that it's not crazy to say the U.N. should be using this." Mr. Johnson is also talking to two companies -- one providing a gene therapy, another that offers stem cells from young bone marrow -- about arranging a discount for Blueprinters. "The idea is to create the Costco of the health and wellness industry," he said.
Mr. Johnson puts the recipes for his meals on his website, so anyone can cook them -- and sell them. After the hike in Los Angeles, the group gathered around a picnic table, where Adrien Cohen, 32, who recently founded a Blueprint-based meal prep start-up, distributed containers of Nutty Pudding and Super Veggie.
Mr. Tang, whose previous project was organizing "T-parties" where men gathered to measure their testosterone levels, said his meal prep company was serving 1,000 Blueprint meals a week in the San Francisco area. He said he planned to pivot away from the Blueprint branding, but for now it's a "signaling banner for people who want to improve their health."
Mr. Johnson said he was delighted that others were building their own businesses around Blueprint. However, he has trademarked the Blueprint name and said he might eventually try to work out licensing agreements with the other companies using it.
He declined to comment on his current net worth but said he was less focused on making money than expanding the reach of Blueprint. "This is not a money grab," he said. (Mr. Johnson said that the business's revenues so far total several millions of dollars, a claim that could not be verified.)
But, he said, he's reaching the limit of experiments he can perform on himself. Hence the new "clinical trial," in which volunteers will consume Blueprint products for three months and then get tested to measure the results. (Participants have to pay for the testing themselves, which amounts to $ 800 or $ 1,600, depending on the extent of testing.) There's no control group, it's short term, participants consume 67 different therapies at once, and they're on the "honor system" to eat the Blueprint package and otherwise maintain their base-line diets.
Mr. Steele said that it's unlikely the new study will yield useful data. "It will be impossible to know how much of any observed effect is real, or just the placebo effect," he said.
Mr. Johnson concedes that the design is not that of a clinical trial that the mainstream scientific community will accept. "Will this trial end up being reputable? We'll see," he said.

LOS ANGELES — “Ready, on three,” Jamie Love said to the group of hikers as they huddled for a photo. “One, two, three …”
“Don’t die!” they shouted in unison.
The dozen or so strangers were gathered at the foot of Temescal Canyon Trail along the Pacific coast in Los Angeles on a cool Saturday morning in mid-December. Several of them, including Love, 38, who had organized the outing, wore black T-shirts with the bold white text, “DON’T DIE.”
The hikers had come together with a shared goal: to extend their life spans through diet, sleep, exercise and whatever technologies might come along.
Not present was the spiritual leader of the gathering, the internet celebrity and centimillionaire tech founder turned longevity guru Bryan Johnson. In the past year, Johnson has arguably taken the lead in the race among Silicon Valley rich guys going to extremes in a quest to live forever. (Move over, Messrs. Bezos, Zuckerberg and Thiel.) Now he’s turning that longevity mission — and the online infamy he has earned because of it — into a lifestyle business, selling supplements and prepackaged meals to less-rich people who would also like to live for a very long time. The hike, one of more than 30 “Don’t Die Meet-Ups” around the world that day, was a cross between community-building and a guerrilla marketing tactic.
Johnson’s deal, in a nutshell: In 2021, he began spending $2 million a year, by his own account, to measure every aspect of his body, from lipid levels to urination speed to brain plaque, with the goal of reversing his aging process. He called it Project Blueprint.
Every day, between 7 and 11 a.m., he eats the same three vegan meals: “Nutty Pudding” (a blend of nuts, seeds, berries and pomegranate juice), “Super Veggie” (black lentils topped with broccoli and cauliflower) and a third, rotating dish consisting of vegetables, roots and nuts. He exercises for an hour every morning and takes up to 111 pills a day. (His pharyngeal muscles may be the strongest of all.)
Johnson claims that his regimen (or “protocol,” as he calls it) has already slowed his speed of aging, giving him, at 46, the maximum heart rate of a 37-year-old, the gum inflammation of a 17-year-old and the facial wrinkles of a 10-year-old, according to his website. He publicizes his test results so anyone can see images of his bowels or learn the duration of his nighttime erections. His “biological age,” he claimed until recently, is 42.5, according to one measurement of changes in DNA over time known as an epigenetic clock. In other words, he has spent about three years shaving off — maybe — a little more than three years.
If the original goal of Project Blueprint was to perfect his health, Johnson now describes it as preparing humanity to thrive in a world dominated by artificial intelligence. Thus the new slogan: “Don’t Die.”
In an interview, Johnson said he didn’t care what present-day people thought of him. “I’m more interested in what people of the 25th century think of me,” he said. “The majority of opinions now represent the past.”
Now, Johnson said, after three years of self-experimentation — which he called “Phase 1” of Blueprint — he’s ready for “Phase 2”: helping others replicate his process. Late last year, he began selling Blueprint-branded olive oil. This month, more products, including powdered vegetables and pill supplements, became available on his website. In conjunction with the rollout, Johnson announced a “self-experimentation study” in which participants can pay for a starter pack of Blueprint products, as well as blood work and other tests to track their results. The 2,500 slots filled up within 24 hours.
To his fans, who fly across the country to meet him and haunt Blueprint message boards online, this moment is an exciting opportunity to spread the Johnson gospel. Some Blueprint advocates are even building businesses of their own around his ideas. To his detractors, it’s a cynical attempt to monetize his popularity.

FRONT PAGE
Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the start of U.N. hearings on allegations of genocide against Israel brought by South Africa referred imprecisely to South Africa's accusations. South Africa said Israel's actions in Gaza against Palestinians were "genocidal in character," not its actions against Hamas.
BUSINESS
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about charges brought against eBay for stalking, witness tampering and obstruction of justice misstated Joshua S. Levy's job title. He is an acting U.S. attorney, not an acting attorney general.
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the discontinuance of Fruit Stripe gum misstated when gum was introduced. It was the early 1960s, not the late 1960s.
ARTS
An article on Thursday about a Christie's auction of the contents of Elton John's former Atlanta home, using information from a publicist at Christie's, misstated the last time that a major selection of his collection was offered to the public. It was at a sale in 2003, not one in 1988.
WEEKEND ARTS
A movie review on Friday about "The Book of Clarence" described incorrectly the relationship between the television show "The Chosen" and Angel Studios. The studio ran a crowdfunding campaign for the show and initially distributed it; it was not the producer.
SPECIAL SECTION: 52 PLACES TO GO IN 2024
An article on Page 8 this weekend about Yamaguchi, Japan, misstates the city's population. It is about 190,000, not 170,000.
Because of an editing error, an article on Page 63 this weekend about Grenada misstates how someone would reach Molinere Underwater Sculpture Park. It is accessible by snorkeling or scuba diving, not by a submarine.

The British Museum Seeks a New Leader: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The museum is seeking a new leader to manage the fallout from recent thefts and demands to return contested items. Applicants have two weeks to apply.
Wanted: Someone to restore trust in one of the world's most visited museums after an embarrassing scandal, handle restitution claims and raise $ 1.27 billion for a major refurbishment.
Salary: $ 275,000 a year.
The British Museum in London this week began the search for a new director. Four months ago, Hartwig Fischer resigned from that position after the museum announced that one of its curators had looted around 1,500 items from its storerooms, then sold some on eBay.
In September, Mark Jones, a former leader of the Victoria and Albert Museum, was appointed to run the British Museum, but only on an interim basis.
Applicants for the permanent position must have a "vision for the future of the British Museum and its purpose as a national and a global museum in the 21st century," the job posting says. But they must also be able to deal with a host of problems affecting the august institution, which is the world's third most visited museum.
As well as the fallout from the theft scandal, which has damaged morale among the museum's nearly 1,000-strong staff, the chosen candidate will have to manage calls for the return of contested objects in the museum's collection, including hundreds of Benin Bronzes and the Parthenon Sculptures, also known as the Elgin Marbles. The new director will also need to lead fund-raising efforts for a refurbishment project involving a reorganization of the museum's galleries and improvements to the museum's plumbing, heating and leaky roof. The Financial Times has reported that it will cost 1 billion pounds, around $ 1.27 billion.
Last October, George Osborne, the museum's chairman, told British lawmakers that finding the right candidate to lead the institution was "a very, very complicated job." Because it is also a research organization, Osborne added, the successful applicant would need "to command the respect of the academic community," as well as having experience "managing large, complex organizations."
The director will be paid £215,841 a year, about $ 275,000, according to the listing. That sum is paltry compared to the salaries paid to the directors of equivalent American institutions. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York pays Max Hollein, its director, a base salary of $ 1 million, according to tax filings. In the United States, some museum directors also receive luxury housing on top of their salary.
Observers regularly mention a handful of serious contenders for the British Museum job. Those include Ian Blatchford, the director of the Science Museum in London; Nicholas Cullinan, who leads Britain's National Portrait Gallery and who recently oversaw a multimillion-pound renovation of that institution; and Taco Dibbits, the director-general of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, who has overseen some of Europe's most talked-about recent exhibitions, including a blockbuster 2023 Vermeer retrospective.
Representatives for Cullinan, Dibbits and Blatchford all declined to comment.
In keeping with recent high-profile American museum appointments, the job listing suggests that the British Museum's trustees are open to unexpected, or even outsider, applicants. "We are agnostic about the type of candidate we are looking for, whether that is someone from within or outside the museum sector," the listing says. Last year, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Foundation named Mariët Westermann, the vice chancellor of N.Y.U. Abu Dhabi, as its new leader.
Potential applicants have just a couple of weeks to apply for the role: The closing date is Jan. 26.

In a Rare Move, the Justice Department Charges eBay in a Cyberstalking Case: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The case involves eBay employees trying to intimidate a Massachusetts couple who write and produce an e-commerce newsletter. The company will pay a criminal penalty of $ 3 million.
The Justice Department charged eBay on Thursday with stalking, witness tampering and obstruction of justice in a rare criminal case against a well-known Silicon Valley company.
The charges, which will be dropped under a deferred prosecution agreement if eBay maintains a good record for the next three years, stem from actions taken by the company in 2019 to undermine and silence the writers of an e-commerce newsletter that was mildly critical of some of its behavior. The intimidation efforts included various forms of cyberstalking and harassment that were continuing when the perpetrators were arrested.
In its agreement with the government, eBay will engage an independent corporate compliance monitor. It also agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $ 3 million, the maximum fine for its six felony offenses. The government will not move ahead with the case unless the company violates the agreement.
Although the money is inconsequential for a company that had more than $ 5 billion cash on hand in its most recent quarter, the notoriety is not.
"EBay engaged in absolutely horrific, criminal conduct," said Joshua S. Levy, the acting U.S. attorney. "The company's employees and contractors involved in this campaign put the victims through pure hell, in a petrifying campaign aimed at silencing their reporting and protecting the eBay brand."
David and Ina Steiner, writers and publishers of a news site and blog called EcommerceBytes, live in Natick, Mass.; eBay is based in San Jose, Calif. During the course of the harassment campaign, eBay security team members flew to Boston to accelerate their activities against the couple in-person. When they were caught, they began a cover-up and destroyed incriminating messages.
The forms of harassment included: threatening direct messages over Twitter, the social media platform that is now called X; attempts to install a GPS device on the Steiners' car; posting ads for fictitious sexual events at the Steiners' house; and sending anonymous and scary items like a bloody pig's mask to the couple's home.
A 24-page document detailing the charges that was released on Thursday broadens the number of eBay executives in the case. In earlier documents, only two executives were mentioned -- the chief executive and the chief communications officer. Now there is a third executive, identified as eBay's senior vice president for global operations.
"Sometimes, you just need to make an example out of someone," read a text that the chief communications officer sent to the senior vice president on May 31, 2019. "Justice," the text continued. The chief communications officer then wrote, referring to Ms. Steiner: "We are too nice. She needs to be crushed."
A spokesman for Devin Wenig, who was eBay's chief executive at the time, had no comment. The other two former executives could not be reached.
The Steiners said in a statement on their website that they were targeted "because we gave eBay sellers a voice and because we reported facts that top executives didn't like publicly laid bare."
Seven individuals who worked for eBay's corporate security team were arrested for their actions against the Steiners in 2020. All pleaded guilty, and six of them were sentenced to either prison or home confinement. Jim Baugh, who ran the security team, was sentenced to 57 months in prison in September 2022. One individual is still awaiting sentencing.
"The company's conduct in 2019 was wrong and reprehensible," Jamie Iannone, eBay's chief executive, said in a statement on the company website. He added that eBay "remains committed to upholding high standards of conduct and ethics and to making things right with the Steiners."
The Steiners' efforts to reach a settlement with eBay collapsed long ago. The couple filed a lawsuit against eBay that is scheduled to go to trial next year.
"The Steiners' goal was always to have the government hold all of those involved held criminally responsible, and this is a step in the right direction," their lawyer, Rosemary Scapicchio, said on Thursday.

Fruit Stripe Gum Fans Pay Tribute as It's Discontinued: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Its disappearance from store shelves invited nostalgic posts on social media. "Best two seconds of flavor you've ever had," one person wrote on Reddit.
Fruit Stripe, the striped chewing gum known for its short burst of flavor, has been discontinued after more than a half-century, inspiring nostalgic tributes across social media.
"Best two seconds of flavor you've ever had," one Reddit user wrote on Wednesday. "R.I.P. to a legend."
Rainbow-colored packs of Fruit Stripe gum first appeared in stores in the United States in the early 1960s. Ferrara, a confectioner based in Chicago, said this week that it had stopped making the product.
"We considered many factors before coming to this decision, including consumer preferences, and purchasing patterns -- and overall brand trends," the company said in a statement.
The pack's five sticks of gum were stamped with wavy zebra stripes, and each stick was a different color and flavor: cherry, lemon, orange, peach and "Wet n' Wild Melon." The taste, more tangy than fruity, was notorious for disappearing within seconds, almost upon contact.
Early advertising used the Fruit Stripe Gum Man, an anthropomorphic gum pack with limbs and a face. Later, advertisers used a family of animals, including a zebra, tiger, elephant and mouse, in commercials and on posters, and in a line of retail products that included coloring books and stuffed toys.
Yipes the Zebra emerged as the dominant mascot, with every gum wrapper doubling as a Yipes temporary tattoo. The tattoos depicted Yipes in active poses, such as skateboarding, playing baseball or eating grass.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Fruit Stripe also came in jumbo packs of 17 sticks. On social media, consumers shared childhood memories of consuming all 17 sticks of gum in one sitting, in a vain attempt to make the gum's flavor last.
"The wildest three second ride that your taste buds ever knew," one person posted on Reddit.
An account on X, the social media site, called Discontinued Foods!, described Fruit Stripe as "an icon in the gum field," and people filled a thread with jokes about how quickly the gum went from delicious to disappointing.
Several compared chewing Fruit Stripe to chasing a drug high.
Ferrara, which also makes Sweet Tarts, Nerds, Laffy Taffy and Fun Dip, said that consumers may still be able to find Fruit Stripe in stores, but it was unclear how much inventory remained. The company did not respond to an interview request on Thursday.
The websites of several large retailers, including Walmart and Amazon, listed Fruit Stripe as unavailable.
The gum could be found on eBay, where one seller was offering a dozen packs for $ 189 alongside other Fruit Stripe paraphernalia, including T-shirts, coffee mugs and vintage posters featuring a grinning Yipes the Zebra.

College Bowls in Trouble? Call the Memes.: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A playoff system upended old traditions, but a few minor games still manage to stand out. A vat of mayonnaise was spilled and one giant Pop-Tart was harmed along the way.
After winning the Pop-Tarts Bowl on Dec. 28 in Orlando, Fla., Kansas State's football team gathered on the field around a garage-size toaster that was protected by a pair of mall cops wearing "Snack Security" shirts.
An unusual chant erupted -- "Toast that mascot! Toast that mascot!" -- as Strawberry, a giant Pop-Tart with limbs, climbed to the top of the toaster, bopping along to the disco-era beat of "Hot Stuff," by Donna Summer.
"We will always love you, Strawberry," the announcer Jason Ryan Perry said over the stadium's public address system. "Can't wait to eat you."
For nearly three hours, Strawberry had worked the crowd as one of the surprise stars of the game -- and of the entire college bowl season, which was no small feat for an anthropomorphized breakfast pastry. By the time Strawberry tossed aside a sign that read "Dreams Really Do Come True" so that it could happily slide through a slot and have its crust toasted to golden-brown perfection, the internet was about to crater.
Sure enough, Strawberry soon emerged from the toaster as an edible version of itself. The victorious players pounced, gorging themselves on Strawberry by the handful until all that was left -- R.I.P., Strawberry -- was its left eye.
"I think those guys were really hungry," Heidi Ray, the senior director of brand marketing for Pop-Tarts, said in a telephone interview.
In a crowded marketplace, the Pop-Tarts Bowl -- renamed this year after having previously been the Cheez-It Bowl, the Camping World Bowl and several other monikers -- managed to do something special: elevate an otherwise ordinary game into a viral sensation.
Michigan and Washington will face off in the College Football Playoff national championship game Monday night, but in an era in which there are more than 40 bowl games a season, with only two of them -- the Rose Bowl and the Sugar Bowl, serving as national championship semifinals -- carrying any sort of significance, the Pop-Tarts Bowl won the internet.
Or, at the very least, it shared the internet championship with the Duke's Mayo Bowl.
From a competitive standpoint, the playoff system, which made its debut in 2014 and will add quarterfinal games next year, has rendered the other bowls into artifacts of a bygone era when they meant more to teams -- and to their conferences -- than they do now. As a result, many prominent players with N.F.L. aspirations opt out of the games if there is nothing on the line.
None of that has slowed a steady drumbeat in favor of even more bowl games, which generate decent ratings and advertising revenue around the holidays.
With so many mostly meaningless bowls -- the Guaranteed Rate Bowl and the Bad Boy Mowers Pinstripe Bowl, the Radiance Technologies Independence Bowl and the Avocados from Mexico Cure Bowl -- the most intense competition is not necessarily between teams on the field but among the brands that are hoping for a fleeting (and profitable) moment of virality.
"I think doing it in unique, fun ways is an important way to keep bowls relevant," said Miller Yoho, the director of marketing and communications for the Charlotte Sports Foundation, which hosts the Duke's Mayo Bowl. "Honestly, this is the most anyone's been talking about it in the 10 years I've been doing it."
When Duke's Mayo, a condiments company based in Richmond, Va., began sponsoring the game in 2020 -- it had previously been sponsored by, among others, Meineke Car Care Center -- the feeling was that the company "needed to do something different to make mayonnaise cool again," said Joe Tuza, the condiments president of Sauer Brands, which owns Duke's Mayo. In partnering with college football, the brand has sought to capitalize on its share of made-for-the-internet moments, both planned and unplanned.
Since 2021, the winning coach of the game has gotten drenched with a cooler full of mayonnaise as Tubby, the brand's aggressively eyebrowed mascot, triumphantly raises his arms and Mr. Tuza stands nearby with a cartoon-size check. The incentive for the coach is that $ 10,000 goes to a charity of his choice.
"Every time I'm up onstage with the trophies, the players start chanting, 'Mayo dump! Mayo dump!"' Mr. Tuza said. "It's like a payoff for them to see their coach get doused after all the hard work they've put in."
And while various skeptics, including Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs, a noted mayonnaise hater, have questioned whether it is actually mayonnaise, Mr. Tuza and Mr. Yoho both vouched for its authenticity.
"It's 100 percent mayonnaise," Mr. Yoho said. "I've smelled it. They have to stir it to get the viscosity right."
Ahead of this season's game on Dec. 27, Duke's Mayo upped the ante by staging a draft-style combine to select the two people who would dump the mayonnaise on the winning coach. (This was lingering fallout from the 2021 game, when Shane Beamer, the coach of South Carolina, was accidentally bonked on the head by the cooler; Duke's Mayo later sent him a hard hat.) Mr. Yoho said he watched the combine via live feed.
"I just see people covered in mayo trying to catch a football," he said. "I'm like, 'What is happening?"'
The extra effort paid off. Duke's Mayo had a record day of online sales during this year's game, Mr. Tuza said, and the company expects to generate about $ 10 million worth of brand exposure, more than doubling its investment.
"Based on the size of our business, it's a big investment for us," Mr. Tuza said, "so we really needed to make it work. We had to execute and not just slap our name on the sponsorship."
Amid a cluttered bowl game landscape, complacency will get you left behind. Bowl season never rests, not entirely. For example, one of the attractions at the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl was a branded hot tub -- "Feelin' the Cheeziest" -- that is now available for purchase on eBay, with proceeds going toward the Florida Citrus Sports Foundation. (Condition: used.)
And the day after the Duke's Mayo Bowl, Mr. Yoho was a part of a text chain with colleagues who were already looking ahead to the 2024 edition of the game. The gist of those messages?
"OK, we just saw the Pop-Tarts Bowl, and it's game on," Mr. Yoho recalled.
The Pop-Tarts phenomenon was something to behold, in no small measure because of the exploits of Strawberry, who was played by Barry Anderson, a former mascot for the Chicago Bulls. In its first and only public appearance, Strawberry danced with fans, distributed bite-size versions of itself and welcomed its own demise. (Thanks to the magic of television, Mr. Anderson did not actually toast himself.)
"It far surpassed any of our expectations," Ms. Ray said, adding: "We didn't have to fake anything. That's totally the brand. That's how we treat social every day of the year. We just brought a little bit of that world to the world of college football."
And while Strawberry is now the highest-profile individual Pop-Tart in the brand's 60-year history, Kellanova produces about three billion of the treats annually, Ms. Ray said. In other words, Strawberry was not a one-off. There is more talent in the pipeline.
"Everyone witnessed that Strawberry was consumed by the Wildcats, and he's happily in mouth heaven because his dreams came true," Ms. Ray said. "But fear not: This is not the last time you will see an edible Pop-Tart as the mascot."

Vintage Films Are His Animating Passion: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Guess you could say I hoard," said Tommy José Stathes as he maneuvered around the shelves of his storage unit. Large enough to accommodate a minivan, it was stuffed with thousands of film canisters stacked floor to ceiling, arranged by studio and labeled with Sharpie. "Bray: Farmer Alfalfa Sees New York," one read. Another said: "Fleischer: Adventures of Popeye (1935)."
"Oh," he muttered absently as he paused before a tower of brass movie cans, "what do we have here?"
Once a week, Mr. Stathes heads from his small studio apartment in Queens to his enormous collection of vintage cartoons: a celluloid library of around 4,000 reels, some of the prints more than 100 years old. It is certainly one of the largest collections of early animated films anywhere in the world -- and that accounts for the holdings of the Library of Congress, according to an archivist who does restoration there.
Usually, Mr. Stathes is searching for a specific clip -- something with Felix the Cat ("the biggest star in 1920s cartoons"), say, or Popeye -- for the regular events he hosts at Metrograph, an arty Lower East Side movie house with red velvet seating and chilled Junior Mints.
For his most recent screening, he dug out some vintage reels with a Christmas feel, like Fleischer Studios' "Somewhere in Dreamland" -- a Technicolor fantasia that follows two street urchins who scavenge firewood and go to bed hungry. Mr. Stathes first watched it on VHS tape as a toddler. "I think it helped me to better understand and connect with the inner children in my own grandparents, all of whom were born right around the time of the 1929 stock market crash and grew up during the Great Depression."
Now 34, Mr. Stathes makes a living as a professor of animation history at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. But his true vocation is curating vintage cartoon programs. In addition to his gig at Metrograph, he also regularly shows at Roxy Cinema and the Society of Illustrators and has over the last decade landed a recurring role on Turner Classic Movies.
It was by sheer chance that executives at the network, also known as TCM, saw an article about a 21-year-old movie historian on Fox News Latino.
They understood quickly that this young collector had amassed a deeper cartoon archive than TCM had ever gained access to. "We can't do everything," the network's longtime lead programmer, Charles Tabesh, said in a phone interview. "But sometimes something comes along and you just think: This is an important part of film history -- one we've never explored."
The network contracted Mr. Stathes to produce a program in 2012, for which he provided an hour's worth of silent animation he had recently restored. Then, a couple of years later, he found himself being interviewed on air by the channel's marquee host, Robert Osborne, as the network's expert on vintage cartoons. Mr. Stathes knew then that he had arrived.
It is a far cry from his early days, when he used to screen oddball cartoons at strange little pop-up places that don't typically show movies. His very first show, when he was not even old enough to drink, was in a dive bar stuffed with vintage clutter in Bushwick, Brooklyn, called Goodbye Blue Monday. From that success, he bounced around various community centers (including the Queens Public Library, where he had a yearslong stint) and storefront galleries, like Shoestring Press in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
This avocation can be traced back to an obscure Farmer Alfalfa cartoon his father showed him once. From there, he expanded to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and Felix the Cat, and he started hunting for reels in local antique shops and flea markets. He soon progressed to eBay, ultimately piling up a six-figure investment in the archive.
His devotion to silent cartoons -- the very birth of the form -- is unrivaled. In fact, he has helped the Library of Congress identify some of its own collection. George Willeman, who oversees the nitrate film vaults for the library, recalled being amazed when Mr. Stathes, then in his 20s, took a seat in the archive and identified reel after reel of unidentified cartoons made decades before he was even born.
"As far as I know," Mr. Willeman said, "Tommy is the king of silent animation."
As for how much his archive is worth today, Mr. Stathes is reluctant to venture a guess. "Films don't have standardized valuations like coins or other regularly traded collectibles," he said. "It's a very niche, specialized field concerning objects that are more utilitarian than anything else."
"Might any of the kids here be alarmed by a creepy snowman?" Mr. Stathes asked a 100-strong crowd, nearly all of them adults shifting around on velvet seats during a Halloween-themed screening at Metrograph a couple months ago. It's clear he loves playing M.C. -- as he worked the audience, his enthusiasm was infectious. Mr. Stathes launched into a discussion of the disputed merits of Molly Moo-Cow, a key character for New York City-based Van Beuren Studios during the 1930s. "She always saves the day -- and she's a cow!" he marveled. "I mean ..." His voice trailed off and he sighed wistfully.
Ian Adams, who began attending Mr. Stathes's cartoon screenings back when they were projected onto sheets tacked to the walls of ad hoc venues, is now part of Metrograph's programming department. The repertory theater first sought Mr. Stathes out to do a Halloween program in 2021. His Christmastime "Happy Endings" special ran last week. "Tommy has a following," Mr. Adams said.
This August, Mr. Stathes introduced the theatrical release of "Cartoon Carnival" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where he stayed for a Q. and A. session with the audience. Produced by a British filmmaker, the movie focuses on the pioneers of cartoons and follows Mr. Stathes's quest to preserve them. According to the director, Andrew T. Smith, Mr. Stathes "kind of inspired the documentary." He stumbled onto Mr. Stathes's work online and was struck by his devotion.
"He just kind of crossed me as someone very young to take on this quite big responsibility of gathering this archive of neglected films," Mr. Smith said.
"Cartoon Carnival" has been shown on TCM, but Mr. Stathes is hoping it will get picked up by a streaming service like Netflix, which would definitely help offset the costs associated with maintaining the archive. The rent for his storage unit is now up to nearly $ 1,000 per month.
"That's the kind of big break I truly need," Mr. Stathes said. "Yes, I do it out of a love for the medium -- because I enjoy sharing the film. But I do also have to get either a flat fee or a share of ticket sales, to get by."
"Hopefully a time will come when I don't have to push so hard and hustle so much every single day to keep all this collecting and archiving and storing and event production afloat," he continued. "I still want to do those things as the years go on, but really need an additional set of buoys under me."

Full text: Parts of some missing objects have probably been sold to scrap metal merchants, museum administrators say.
Four months after the British Museum fired a curator suspected of stealing gems, jewelry and semiprecious stones, the London institution on Tuesday released further information about the fate of the missing items.
Officials assume that around 1,500 artifacts were stolen or are otherwise missing from its Greek and Roman stores, the museum said in a news release. Another 350 items have been damaged, the statement added, including by gold having been removed. Those gold parts were "likely to be unrecoverable," the museum said, and were probably sold to scrap metal merchants.
Another 140 items that remain in the museum's possession "have been damaged by tool marks," the news release added.
Of the missing 1,500 items, just over 350 had been returned, a British Museum spokeswoman said in an interview. Another 300 items had been identified, but those items had not been recovered.
The spokeswoman said that all the returned items had come from Ittai Gradel, a rare gem dealer who, in 2021, first alerted the British Museum to the losses, only to have his concerns rebuffed. Previously, Gradel had bought some of the items before realizing they belonged to the museum.
The spokeswoman said that the museum estimates the thief only made around 100,000 pounds, or $ 125,000, selling the artifacts via websites including eBay, based on the items' listings. Further details of the missing items could not be released because of an ongoing police investigation, she added.
The British Museum has given regular updates on its investigation since it announced the thefts in August. In October, George Osborne, the museum's chair, and Mark Jones, the museum's interim director, unveiled a $ 12-million, five-year project to improve the British Museum's record keeping.
On Tuesday, the museum also released some details of an independent review into the thefts, by Mark Boardman, a senior lawyer; Ian Karet, a British judge; and Lucy D'Orsi, a police official.
The review's main recommendations for how the museum can improve its security were not made public, but the British Museum published 36 other suggestions on its website. Those cover improvements to the museum's policies and management procedures, including more frequent inventory checks.
Osborne, who declined an interview request, said in the news release that he had accepted all the review's recommendations. The British Museum was "putting our own house in order," he added.

Dead Painter Talking: An Algorithm Resurrects van Gogh: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Can doppelgängers of the Dutch painter help museums generate new interest and income? A.I. Vincent fields our questions (and makes some mistakes).
Vincent van Gogh has been surprisingly busy for a dead man.
His paintings have featured in major museum exhibitions this year. Immersive theaters in cities like Miami and Milan bloom with projections of his swirling landscapes. His designs now appear on everything from sneakers to doormats, and a recent collaboration with the Pokémon gaming franchise was so popular that buyers stampeded at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, forcing it to suspend selling the trading cards in the gift shop.
But one of the boldest attempts at championing van Gogh's legacy yet is at the Musée D'Orsay in Paris, where a lifelike doppelgänger of the Dutch artist chats with visitors, offering insights into his own life and death (replete with machine-learning flubs).
"Bonjour Vincent," intended to represent the painter's humanity, was assembled by engineers using artificial intelligence to parse through some 900 letters that the artist wrote during the 1800s, as well as early biographies written about him. However the algorithm still needed some human guidance on how to answer the touchiest questions from visitors, who converse with van Gogh's replica on a digital screen, through a microphone. The most popular one: Why did van Gogh kill himself? (The painter died in July 1890 after shooting himself in a wheat field near Auvers.)
Hundreds of visitors have asked that morbid question, museum officials said, explaining that the algorithm is constantly refining its answers, depending on how the question is phrased. A.I. developers have learned to gently steer the conversation on sensitive topics like suicide to messages of resilience.
"I would implore this: cling to life, for even in the bleakest of moments, there is always beauty and hope," said the A.I. van Gogh during an interview.
The program has some less oblique responses. "Ah, my dear visitor, the topic of my suicide is a heavy burden to bear. In my darkest moments, I believed that ending my life was the only escape from the torment that plagued my mind," van Gogh said in another moment, adding, "I saw no other way to find peace."
Agnès Abastado, the museum's head of digital development, said the discussion of developing a van Gogh algorithm took nearly a year. "One of the questions we asked ourselves was at what point this van Gogh was the real van Gogh," she said. "It was important to show how this technology will not only be a commercial project, but a cultural one that can improve the display of knowledge."
The initiative is integral to a larger effort by the Musée D'Orsay, a public institution supported by the French government, to assert its relevance in modern life when the bulk of its collection originates in the 19th century. And to make that leap forward, the museum has partnered with several companies that might profit from the enterprise. Some programs are connected with its current exhibition, "Van Gogh in Auvers-sur-Oise: The Final Months," through Feb. 4, which looks at the artist's crucial and exhausting last months alive, when -- under the care of Dr. Gachet, the homeopathic and allopathic doctor -- he produced more than 74 paintings and 33 drawings before he killed himself.
A disturbing finale -- but apparently not too disturbing to bring into peoples' homes. Jumbo Mana, the tech start-up that developed the van Gogh algorithm, said it plans to release the van Gogh A.I. program on Amazon Alexa and Echo devices within the next year. The company is working on a similar project based on the life of the French poet Arthur Rimbaud, another radical artist who experimented with hallucinations and the edges of consciousness.
"We are able to bring these characters to life, but we are not trying to rebirth them," said Christophe Renaudineau, the chief executive of Jumbo Mana. "Right now, we are working with historians to ensure our van Gogh can be more accurate."
The exhibition also includes a separate virtual reality experience, "Van Gogh's Palette." It is a shared production between the museum, Vive Arts, Lucid Realities and Tournez S'il Vous Plait. The Musée D'Orsay will receive a portion of the proceeds and the team is working on a longer version spanning 20 minutes that will have global distribution and display.
Many art historians were dismayed to see van Gogh become a digital ambassador for museum efforts that appeared to commodify his paintings. But some scholars admitted that they could understand the appeal.
"He was a really intense devotee of popular culture in his own time," said Michael Lobel, the author of an upcoming book about the artist's engagement with industrialization. "Van Gogh was thinking really closely and carefully about his own potential to make images for a wider audience."
So the experiments with van Gogh's paintings have continued, including their implementation in the video game world of Roblox, an online game that is popular with millions of children. His 1887 "Self-Portrait with a Straw Hat" is one of nearly 40 artworks at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that can be scanned into digital clothing for avatars in Roblox.
"Wearables are such an important part of Roblox," said Claire Lanier, a senior manager of social media at the Met, who spearheaded the project with help from a corporate sponsor, Verizon. "We wanted the artworks to feel tangible to children and their experiences."
By scanning a van Gogh portrait through a mobile app, Replica, users access digital versions of the artist's hat and jacket, which could be combined with elements from other museum objects, like medieval armor and an Egyptian headdress.
(For those looking for real threads, the museum recently announced a collaboration with the fashion brand Todd Snyder, bringing van Gogh's paintings to its parkas and sweaters for hundreds of dollars.)
"For years, museums didn't even want to put their images online," Lanier observed. "But the pandemic really changed people's relationships with museums in the digital world. It has offered opportunities for us."
But those opportunities are putting some museums in uncharted territory. Although the Van Gogh Museum had a history of licensing the artist's paintings for skateboards, scarves and trinkets, its recent partnership with Pokémon Company International went haywire when scalpers swarmed their gift shop, scooping up the special trading cards commemorating the museum's 50th anniversary, which then sold online for hundreds of dollars. The image of Pikachu drawn in the style of the painter's 1887 "Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat" was later pulled from sale because of the frenzy.
Now those cards are making research difficult for some van Gogh historians. "When I look up van Gogh on eBay it's all Pokémon cards," grumbled Wouter van der Veen, a specialist on the artist who frequently uses the auction website to scour for 19th-century papers related to the painter.
Over the last year, the scholar has been a part of several different van Gogh projects, including the A.I. experiment at Musée D'Orsay, where he offered feedback to engineers to sharpen its accuracy. Van der Veen's influence can even be heard in the way the artist speaks French: He introduced seeming grammatical "mistakes" because it was van Gogh's second language.
"You have the same sentence length and lack of punctuation with words falling on each other," Van der Veen said. The errors have disturbed some French visitors, who must be assured by staff that those mistakes are intentional.
But the historian pointed out that other glitches in "Bonjour Vincent" reveal a generative portrait of the Dutch artist that is far from complete. He sometimes provides two different answers to the same question, mixing historical facts with irrelevant information.
One pronounced error was when the doppelgänger named "Starry Night" as van Gogh's favorite artwork, saying it was "a manifestation of my agitated self and my yearning for the divine."
The real van Gogh was much more ambivalent about the 1889 painting, according to his own letters. He originally referred to "Starry Night" as a study and told the artist Émile Bernard that it was a "setback," adding, "once again I'm allowing myself to do stars too big."
Though slightly embarrassed, the team working on "Bonjour Vincent" said they were confident that major inaccuracies would be ironed out before the program's wider release, with a hope that it will improve the collection's reach.
"When it is van Gogh, people like it," Abastado said. "But money is not our goal as a public museum. Our goal is to make the collection speak to everyone."

PARIS — Vincent van Gogh has been surprisingly busy for a dead man.
His paintings have featured in major museum exhibitions this year. Immersive theaters in cities like Miami and Milan bloom with projections of his swirling landscapes.

But one of the boldest attempts at championing van Gogh’s legacy yet is at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris, where a lifelike doppelgänger of the Dutch artist chats with visitors, offering insights into his own life and death (replete with machine-learning flubs).

Here to Help; How to Shop Secondhand for Children's Gifts: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: There's a robust online marketplace of used kids gear, toys, clothing and more for a simple reason: Kids grow fast, and they often outgrow their favorite things when those things are still close to new. Shopping secondhand for normally pricey kids gifts comes with several benefits. It can obviously save you money -- and that's the key concern for many this holiday season. Here's what to know. KALEE THOMPSON
Learn what items to pursue secondhand. Things to consider buying secondhand include baby hiking carriers, kid bike seats, jogging strollers and high chairs, as well as expensive bassinets, bouncers and swings. Of course, make sure they're models that meet current safety standards and haven't been recalled. Safety-related items such as car seats and bike helmets top the list of things to buy new.
Learn where to look for gently used items. When it comes to bigger-ticket kids toys and gear, it makes sense to keep things local. A wide variety of online marketplaces trade kids stuff, including Facebook Marketplace and local Listservs. Nextdoor, Craigslist, Buy Nothing and Freecycle groups can turn up gently used finds for kids. There are also infinite individual online resellers that will ship nationwide, and great finds on sites like Poshmark, Mercari, Kidizen, The RealReal and eBay. But the best deals are found locally.
Target your ask. Scanning through existing listings is perhaps the most obvious way to shop secondhand, but it's also acceptable in many groups to simply ask for exactly what you want. ISO is a common acronym for "in search of." The Buy Nothing community uses terminology like "give" and "ask."
Act fast -- and reply strategically. Once you see what you want, it's wise not to waver. To build your confidence, consider keeping a list of the things you're shopping for and the maximum you're willing to spend. That way, you don't have to research prices while someone else claims the prize. All that searching and saving pays off when you're confident of an amazing deal the moment it appears. Being personal and specific with your message to the seller may also help you stand out.

Full text: The renovated Gilded Age mansion of beer makers in Newark is filled with surprises: a Black history from the 19th century that has been largely invisible.
Sumptuous gilded ornamentation still teems throughout the brick home of the Ballantine family of beer makers in Newark, built in 1885. But objects and artworks newly incorporated into the period rooms show how underappreciated strivers maneuvered in Newark society during the Ballantines' heyday.
The Ballantine House, long used as an annex to the adjacent Newark Museum of Art on Washington Street, is reopening to the public Nov. 17, after a two-year, $ 12 million restoration -- and rethink. The goal of the overhaul was "to wake it up and shake it up," said Linda C. Harrison, the museum's director since 2019. The building, she added, was "not forgotten but just not able to get the attention that it deserved."
Amy Simon Hopwood, the museum's associate curator of decorative arts, who helped spearhead the new installations, said that visitors are encouraged to wonder, "Who's doing the work to keep the room glittering?"
In the entrance hall, alongside a towering wooden mantelpiece carved with the family's "B" initial, paintings have been added that depict working-class Newark life. In an 1870s street scene, firefighters race to quench a blaze, in a carriage full of firefighting equipment steered by a Black driver named Lorenzo Dowd Trent. There are tableaus of Italian Americans celebrating a religious festival in the 1920s, and factory workers from the 1930s pouring molten metal. In an upstairs bedroom, a honey-colored Victorian bedstead has been updated with a red-and-white patchwork quilt, made in the 1930s for Dorothy O. Smith, New Jersey's first Black female podiatrist.
Headless mannequins, which the British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare created for the museum in 2009, are feasting at the dining room table, piled with punchbowls and candelabra. Ballantine family heirlooms, newly scattered around the house, show signs of servants' grueling labor: dazzlingly polished silver vessels from Tiffany & Company, a crisply ironed pillowcase, a recipe book singed by a cooking pot and stained with grease.
An entire gallery has been devoted to the artist and historian Noelle Lorraine Williams's installation, "Stay: The Black Women of 19th-Century Newark," part of an ongoing series called "Black Power! 19th Century."
Williams, a longtime Newark resident, has combed archives and online sources, including eBay, to research the Ballantine neighborhood's unsung residents and visitors. She has assembled portraits and documentation of the acclaimed soprano Marie Selika Williams; the teacher Ellen King, whose family home was an Underground Railroad station; the businesswoman and music teacher Sara O'Fake Evans; and the church leader Hannah Mandeville, who had been born enslaved. There are images of the 20th-century activist Louise Epperson; Eloise Spellman, a seamstress and mother of 11 killed by police or National Guard forces in 1967; and Sakia Gunn, a lesbian teenager murdered in 2003 in a hate crime a few blocks from the museum. (This fall a nearby street was named in Gunn's honor.)
Williams said that "the long history of Blacks in Newark" has been "often invisible." The community was historically far larger, prosperous and accomplished than is commonly believed, "helping to build this city," she added. Black women residents of the 19th century have gone particularly unnoticed, and few depictions of them had been known to exist. In "Stay," she said, "All of the images are hot off the press. This history is 'new' to most folks."
John Ballantine, a second-generation beer maker, and his wife Jeannette commissioned the building from the architect George Edward Harney, who worked for various plutocrats including the Roebling family of bridgebuilders. Many of the construction workers were immigrants from Italy and Germany. In the family's 27 rooms, silks and velvets were draped along the windows, walls and furniture upholstery, and paneling and fireplaces were carved from a rainbow of wood types including mahogany and cherry. Tastemakers from Manhattan were brought in to add more eye-catchers; in the library's window by Louis Comfort Tiffany's team, a windblown blond maiden basks in rays from an opalescent sun.
After John Ballantine's death in 1895, Jeannette remained in the house with the couple's only surviving daughter, Alice Young, who raised her family there. (Four of John and Jeannette's eight children had died young of disease, and in 1905, one of their three surviving sons, Robert Ballantine, died by suicide at the house, after being blackmailed by a lover.)
In 1919, an insurance company acquired the building and adapted it gently into offices. The museum took over the property in 1937 and has been undertaking phase after phase of restoration and décor improvements. In the last two years, crews rebuilt crumbling exterior masonry, rotting window frames and leaky roof sections. They cleaned and repaired the interior; some of the damage was caused by curious visitors, picking at the dining room wallpaper.
The halls now echo with newly-recorded sounds of the Ballantine era: billiard balls thudding, teacups clinking, newspapers rustling, horses' hooves clopping on pavement, pianists practicing ragtime and classical music. Display cases have been filled with vintage glass vessels for Ballantine beer and bejeweled cigarette lighters manufactured in Newark.
Plans are afoot to open more parts of the house to the public. The treasures to be unveiled Friday amount to "the launching pad of many future stories," Hopwood, the associate curator, said. A recurring question among her colleagues is, "What can we look at with new eyes in our collection?"

Full text: The exorbitant cost of luxury fashion has left us out in the cold, wondering who can sustain this market?
Historically, luxury fashion brands have enjoyed strong pricing power, meaning that they can apply considerable increases without necessarily losing customers. But in 2023, price tags hit eye-watering highs -- and there has been no sign of the trend slowing.
According to the data company EDITED, average luxury prices are up by 25 percent since 2019. Many brands attribute their increases to everything from inflation and the balancing out of regional price disparities to the fallout of the pandemic and impact of the war in Ukraine. But for many luxury fashion brands, the uptick has been taking place over a longer timeline.
Take Chanel, where handbag prices have more than doubled since 2016. The auction house Sotheby's found a classic 2.55 Chanel bag sold for around $ 1,650 in 2008. In 2023, that figure from Chanel is closer to $ 10,200. (If the cost had risen in line with inflation over the 15-year period, it would be expected to cost $ 2,359). This week, Pharrell Williams, the men's creative director at Vuitton, unveiled the label's new Millionaire Speedy Bag. The crocodile hide bag is made-to-order, costs a cool million and has a distinctly Scrooge McDuck aura.
"Industrywide, the pricing has gotten truly absurd," the influencer Bryan Yambao noted in an Instagram post this week when discussing a $ 6,000 woolen Miu Miu coat. "I do think this is a good time for most brands to lower their prices."
In the past year there have been signs that so-called aspirational customers, who buy entry-level luxury products like cosmetics and spirits, have curbed their spending. Middle class professionals who once saved up for a luxury investment handbag or coat have been aggressively priced out.
So who is spending $ 3,000 on a knit hat shaped like a duck from the British brand Burberry? What about $ 24,500 on a vicuña jacket by Brunello Cucinelli? Or $ 1,250 on a white cotton shirt by The Row?
The answer is the 1 percent, obviously (or those willing to incur credit card debt). Luca Solca, an analyst for Bernstein, estimates that the top 5 percent of luxury clients now account for more than 40 percent of sales for most luxury goods brands. As wealth inequality increases globally, luxury brands are doubling down on an ever smaller slice of their clientele. Will this strategy work? Or is there a backlash brewing which might force the luxury pricing bubble to burst?
The below discussion among Style journalists has been edited and condensed.
Elizabeth Paton To many people, luxury price tags have always been absurd and almost amoral. And prices in luxury fashion keep going up, and up, and up. Does it matter to customers?
Vanessa Friedman The high prices of Phoebe Philo's new line certainly struck a nerve, despite the fact they are actually at the lower end of the luxury market. It made me wonder why it was the Philo line that sparked such outrage.
Stella Bugbee It's rare to see a collection for the first time and be simultaneously confronted by the prices. We go to fashion shows and admire or critique them on a conceptual level, but often what we see on the runway doesn't make it to the store. It was also more expensive than the old Celine.
VF Although, almost everything "luxury" (including new Celine) is now more expensive than old Celine. Also, perhaps, because Phoebe has become such a mythic, fashion-savior-of-women, rightly or wrongly, and we were waiting for years for her line, a fantasy arose in which she also saved more women by making her clothes available to more people. For some of her fans these prices almost seem like a betrayal.
EP The balance between accessibility and exclusivity has always been a tricky one for luxury fashion brands, especially as the sector expanded into new markets. Now, many people who might have treated themselves with a bag are tightening their belts.
VF Well, the 1 percent are the target market for high fashion. The rest of us are left with perfume and lipstick.
EP Right, but a certain type of professional used to feel like they could save for a special piece. A Burberry raincoat. A Gucci handbag. Those are out of range for nearly everyone now.
Guy Trebay Don't forget about credit card debt, which the Federal Reserve currently pegs at over $ 1 trillion.
SB The resale economy has also changed the calculus. You can get all of those things secondhand, not long after they sell for full price.
EP And if they are hot enough items, they can sell for even more than full price! Like an Hermès Birkin for example.
VF There's a sort of warring imperative here between people who see it as a badge of honor not to buy full price and those who belong to the very tiny club that can. Economics are involved, but as much as anything, it's also psychology.
EP Resale is also a good barometer for whether pricing strategies are working. Chanel and Hermès drive the top of the resale market. More trend-driven high-fashion houses -- who have been raising their prices -- don't fare so well. If there is a market correction, it will be more directed toward brands where people take a loss on products they want to sell on the secondary market.
Jessica Testa I know of at least one resale website, the Paris-based ReSee, where Philo-era Celine is the third most popular brand, below Chanel and Hermès. And there are several independent sellers on Instagram dedicated exclusively to selling Philo-era Celine designs, fetching prices above what they cost at retail 10 years ago. There are people who spend years hunting eBay for one specific product in their size.
VF Which brings me back to Phoebe Philo's current scarcity model: We don't even know how much of any piece they produced (the company wouldn't say) but the message is the market will bear the prices, since the products are sold out. We think because it is more expensive, it has more value.
GT This is the stuff for which Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel. Subjects shown two identical cashmere sweaters, one at a far higher price, inevitably chose the more costly of the two. His point was that we don't think. We act irrationally.
VF I go back to the idea of betrayal. Because so many women relate to Phoebe Philo as a person, or at least the idea of Phoebe and what her work once represented, they felt excluded or ill-served by the pricing of her new line. They cared deeply about what she was going to make, and then it seemed as if she didn't really care at all about including them.
EP Also that Phoebe -- and the powers that be in luxury -- spent a considerable period courting aspirational audiences. It's just now they're pulling the drawbridge up. Fashion is always at risk of looking out of touch with the wider world, and certain items that seem to have gone viral on social in recent months -- like the Burberry duck hat -- triggered particular wrath, more so than usual.
VF Burberry is also selling a $ 21,000 viscose dress with a Burberry knight riding across the front.
GT Better at that point to pin dollar bills to your chest.
EP Speaking of dollars, a quarter of a trillion them have been wiped off the value of Europe's seven biggest luxury businesses since April, and sales are generally down across most fashion groups. That is the aspirational middle class stepping away from the credit card machine.
JT My pet peeve is when high-end brands collaborate with mass-market brands and yet the pricing doesn't even meet in the middle -- it's still $ 900.
EP Like the recent Banana Republic collaboration with Peter Do.
GT And that's relatively new. By contrast, there were the wonderful and completely affordable collabs Jil Sander, Tomas Maier and others did with Uniqlo.
JT Guy Trebay may have complimented my Clare Waight Keller Uniqlo bag a mere two days ago, folks.
EP The collabs do occasionally have some treasures!
VF In a sense they give the luxury brands an excuse for their pricing, because they can say, "Well, but we did this or that mass market collab."
EP I agree and I don't think we will see this approach by the luxury powers changing anytime soon. The bubble doesn't seem to be bursting -- yet.

Watch the Skies! Your Soup Is Here.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Exactly a decade ago, Amazon revealed a program that aimed to revolutionize shopping and shipping. Drones launched from a central hub would waft through the skies delivering just about everything anyone could need. They would be fast, innovative, ubiquitous -- all the Amazon hallmarks.
The buzzy announcement, made by Jeff Bezos on "60 Minutes" as part of a Cyber Monday promotional package, drew global attention. "I know this looks like science fiction. It's not," said Mr. Bezos, Amazon's founder and the chief executive at the time. The drones would be "ready to enter commercial operations as soon as the necessary regulations are in place," probably in 2015, the company said.
Eight additional years later, drone delivery is a reality -- kind of -- on the outskirts of College Station, Texas, northwest of Houston. That is a major achievement for a program that has waxed and waned over the years and lost many of its early leaders to newer and more urgent projects.
Yet the venture as it currently exists is so underwhelming that Amazon can keep the drones in the air only by giving stuff away. Years of toil by top scientists and aviation specialists have yielded a program that flies Listerine Cool Mint Breath Strips or a can of Campbell's Chunky Minestrone With Italian Sausage -- but not both at once -- to customers as gifts. If this is science fiction, it's being played for laughs.
A decade is an eternity in technology, but even so, drone delivery does not approach the scale or simplicity of Amazon's original promotional videos. This gap between dazzling claims and mundane reality happens all the time in Silicon Valley. Self-driving cars, the metaverse, flying cars, robots, neighborhoods or even cities built from scratch, virtual universities that can compete with Harvard, artificial intelligence -- the list of delayed and incomplete promises is long.
"Having ideas is easy," said Rodney Brooks, a robotics entrepreneur and frequent critic of technology companies' hype. "Turning them into reality is hard. Turning them into being deployed at scale is even harder."
Amazon said last month that drone deliveries would expand to Britain, Italy and another, unidentified U.S. city by the end of 2024. Yet even on the threshold of growth, a question lingers. Now that the drones finally exist in at least limited form, why did we think we needed them in the first place?
Dominique Lord and Leah Silverman live in College Station's drone zone. They are Amazon fans and place regular orders for ground delivery. Drones are another matter, even if the service is free for Amazon Prime members. While it's cool to have stuff literally land on your driveway, at least the first few times, there are many hurdles to getting stuff this way.
Only one item can be delivered at a time. It can't weigh over five pounds. It can't be too big. It can't be something breakable, since the drone drops it from 12 feet. The drones can't fly when it is too hot or too windy or too rainy.
You need to be home to put out the landing target and to make sure that a porch pirate doesn't make off with your item or that it doesn't roll into the street (which happened once to Mr. Lord and Ms. Silverman). But your car can't be in the driveway. Letting the drone land in the backyard would avoid some of these problems, but not if there are trees.
Amazon has also warned customers that drone delivery is unavailable during periods of high demand for drone delivery.
The other active U.S. test site is Lockeford, Calif., in the Central Valley. On a recent afternoon, the Lockeford site seemed largely moribund, with only three cars in the parking lot. Amazon said it was delivering via drones in Lockeford and arranged for a New York Times reporter to come back to the site. It also arranged an interview with David Carbon, the former Boeing executive who runs the drone program. The company later canceled both without explanation.
A corporate blog post on Oct. 18 said that drones had safely delivered "hundreds" of household items in College Station since December, and that customers there could now have some medications delivered. Lockeford wasn't mentioned.
After Ms. Silverman and Mr. Lord expressed initial interest in the drone program, Amazon offered $ 100 in gift certificates in October 2022 to follow through. But their service didn't start until June, and then was suspended during a punishing heat wave when the drones could not fly.
The incentives, however, kept coming. The couple got an email the other day from Amazon pushing Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter, which usually costs $ 5.38 but was a "free gift" while supplies lasted. They ordered it, and a little while later a drone dropped a big box containing a small jar. Amazon said "some promotional items" are being offered "as a welcome."
"We don't really need anything they offer for free," said Ms. Silverman, a 51-year-old novelist and caregiver. "The drones feel more like a toy than anything -- a toy that wastes a huge amount of paper and cardboard."
The Texas weather plays havoc with important deliveries. Mr. Lord, a 54-year-old professor of civil engineering at Texas A&M, ordered a medication through the mail. By the time he retrieved the package, the drug had melted. He's hopeful that the drones can eventually handle problems like this.
"I still view this program positively knowing that it is in the experimental phase," he said.
Amazon says the drones will improve over time. It announced a new model, the MK30, last year and released pictures in October. The MK30, which is slated to begin service by the end of 2024, was touted as having a greater range, an ability to fly in inclement weather and a 25 percent reduction in "perceived noise."
When Amazon began working on drones years ago, the retailer took two or three days to ship many items to customers. It worried that it was vulnerable to potential competitors whose vendors were more local, including Google and eBay. Drones were all about speed.
"We can do half-hour delivery," Mr. Bezos promised on "60 Minutes."
For a while, drones were the next big thing. Google developed its own drone service, Wing, which now works with Walmart to deliver items in parts of Dallas and Frisco, Texas. Start-ups got funding -- about $ 2.5 billion was invested between 2013 and 2019, according to the Teal Group, an aerospace consultancy. The veteran venture capitalist Tim Draper said in 2013 that "everything from pizza delivery to personal shopping can be handled by drones." Uber Eats announced a food delivery drone in late 2019. The future was up in the air.
Amazon started thinking really long term. It envisioned, and got a patent for, a drone resupply vehicle that would hover in the sky at 45,000 feet. That's above commercial airplanes, but Amazon said it could use the vehicles to deliver customers a hot dinner.
Yet on the ground, progress was slow, sometimes for technical reasons and sometimes because of the company's corporate DNA. The same aggressive confidence that created a trillion-dollar business undermined Amazon's efforts to work with the Federal Aviation Administration.
"The attitude was: 'We're Amazon. We'll convince the F.A.A.,"' said one former Amazon drone executive, who asked for anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak about the subject. "The F.A.A. wants companies to come in with great humility and great transparency. That is not a strength of Amazon."
A more complicated issue was getting the technology to the point where it was safe not just most of the time but all of the time. The first drone that lands on someone's head, or takes off clutching a cat, sets the program back another decade, particularly if it is filmed.
"Part of the DNA of the tech industry is you can accomplish things you never thought you could accomplish," said Neil Woodward, who spent four years as a senior manager in Amazon's drone program. "But the truth is the laws of physics don't change."
Mr. Woodward, now retired, spent years at NASA in the astronaut program before moving to the private sector.
"When you work for the government, you have 535 people on your board of directors" -- he was referring to Congress -- "and a good chunk of them want to take your funding away because they have other priorities," he said. "That makes government agencies very risk averse. At Amazon, you're given a lot of rope, but you can get out over your skis."
In the end, there must be a market. As Mr. Woodward put it, using an old Silicon Valley cliché: "Do the dogs like the dog food? Sometimes the dogs don't."
Archie Conner, 82, lives a few doors down from Mr. Lord and Ms. Silverman. He sees the drones as less a retail innovation and more a marketing one.
"When you hear a drone, you naturally think about Amazon. It's real out-of-the-box thinking, even if no one orders at all," he said. "Drones were on the news just the other day. People say, 'Wow, Amazon did that."'
Mr. Conner also ordered the free Skippy peanut butter but forgot to put out the landing target, so the drone went away. Then he ordered it again. Meanwhile, an Amazon delivery person showed up with the first jar. So now he and his wife, Belinda, have two jars.
"We haven't found much we really want to pay for," Mr. Conner said. "But we have enjoyed the free peanut butter."

Markets Are on an Even Keel After Wild Swings: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: U.S. stocks were largely stuck in place on Wednesday as Wall Street continued to recalibrate after its recent sharp swings.
The S&P 500 edged up by 4.40 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,382.78 for a third straight day of quiet, mixed trading. Its movements have become much calmer after the index screamed to its best week of the year last week, which itself came after months of painful losses.
The slight gain was enough to extend the index's winning streak to eight days. That ties its longest such winning streak since a nine-day run 19 years ago.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 40.33 points, or 0.1 percent, to 34,112.27, and the Nasdaq composite rose 10.56, or 0.1 percent, to 13,650.41.
Eli Lilly was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the market. It rose 3.2 percent after U.S. regulators said its diabetes treatment, Mounjaro, could be sold as a weight-loss drug and tap into a market with a big potential.
American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines were also toward the front of the market: Each rose more than 2 percent as oil prices dropped.
Warner Brothers Discovery tumbled 19 percent after reporting a worse loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also lost more streaming subscribers than forecast.
The reporting season for summertime profits is winding down, and most companies have been topping Wall Street's forecasts. But the big driver for stock price movements since the summer has been what yields are doing in the bond market.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell late Tuesday, helping to impart calm across financial markets.
A swift rise in the 10-year yield that began in the summer earlier knocked the S&P 500 down by more than 10 percent from its peak for the year. The 10-year yield briefly topped 5 percent to reach its highest level since 2007, as it caught up with the Federal Reserve's main interest rate, which is above 5.25 percent and at its highest level since 2001.
The Fed has raised rates in the hopes of slowing the economy and hurting investment prices enough to put downward pressure on inflation and get it back to its 2 percent goal.
Last week, though, investors took comments from the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, to indicate the central bank's increases to interest rates may be done. He said the summer's jump in Treasury yields could substitute for further hikes to rates if they remain persistent. That triggered a sharp easing in Treasury yields, which in turn helped stocks to rally.
Now, investors are trying to handicap what may come next. A wide range of outcomes is possible, with the 10-year yield potentially easing as low as 3 percent if it were to fall into a recession, according to Bank of America strategists led by Bruno Braizinha. But they also said the 10-year yield could rise back above 5 percent if the economy remained resilient.
A sharp drop in oil prices recently could take some pressure off inflation, which in turn could help the Fed feel more confident about holding rates steady instead of raising them further.
The price for a barrel of U.S. crude oil is back to where it was in July, and it dropped an additional $ 2.04 to settle at $ 75.33. Brent crude, the international standard, fell $ 2.07 to $ 79.54.
Oil prices have been tumbling since topping $ 90 a little more than a month ago. The Israel-Hamas war raised concerns about potential disruptions to supplies, which had made prices volatile.
On Wall Street, Axon Enterprise, the maker of Tasers, body cameras and other equipment, rose 6.1 percent after it reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts forecast. Ralph Lauren rose 3.2 percent after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts forecast.
eBay sank 2 percent after its forecast for revenue for the last three months of 2023 fell short of analysts' expectations.
Rivian Automotive swung from an early gain to a loss of 2.4 percent after it raised its forecast for how many vehicles it would produce this year and reported weaker profit than expected for the latest quarter.

COLLEGE STATION, Texas — Exactly a decade ago, Amazon revealed a program that aimed to revolutionize shopping and shipping. Drones launched from a central hub would waft through the skies delivering just about everything anyone could need. They would be fast, innovative, ubiquitous — all the Amazon hallmarks.
The buzzy announcement, made by Jeff Bezos on “60 Minutes” as part of a Cyber Monday promotional package, drew global attention. “I know this looks like science fiction. It’s not,” said Bezos, Amazon’s founder and the CEO at the time. The drones would be “ready to enter commercial operations as soon as the necessary regulations are in place,” probably in 2015, the company said.
Eight additional years later, drone delivery is a reality — kind of — on the outskirts of College Station, Texas, northwest of Houston. That is a major achievement for a program that has waxed and waned over the years and lost many of its early leaders to newer and more urgent projects.
Yet the venture as it currently exists is so underwhelming that Amazon can keep the drones in the air only by giving stuff away. Years of toil by top scientists and aviation specialists have yielded a program that flies Listerine Cool Mint Breath Strips or a can of Campbell’s Chunky Minestrone With Italian Sausage — but not both at once — to customers as gifts. If this is science fiction, it’s being played for laughs.
A decade is an eternity in technology, but even so, drone delivery does not approach the scale or simplicity of Amazon’s original promotional videos. This gap between dazzling claims and mundane reality happens all the time in Silicon Valley. Self-driving cars, the metaverse, flying cars, robots, neighborhoods or even cities built from scratch, virtual universities that can compete with Harvard, artificial intelligence — the list of delayed and incomplete promises is long.
“Having ideas is easy,” said Rodney Brooks, a robotics entrepreneur and frequent critic of technology companies’ hype. “Turning them into reality is hard. Turning them into being deployed at scale is even harder.”
Amazon said in October that drone deliveries would expand to Britain, Italy and another, unidentified U.S. city by the end of 2024. Yet even on the threshold of growth, a question lingers: Now that the drones finally exist in at least limited form, why did we think we needed them in the first place?
Dominique Lord and Leah Silverman live in College Station’s drone zone. They are Amazon fans and place regular orders for ground delivery. Drones are another matter, even if the service is free for Amazon Prime members. While it’s cool to have stuff literally land on your driveway, at least the first few times, there are many hurdles to getting stuff this way.
Only one item can be delivered at a time. It can’t weigh more than 5 pounds. It can’t be too big. It can’t be something breakable, since the drone drops it from 12 feet. The drones can’t fly when it is too hot or too windy or too rainy.
You need to be home to put out the landing target and to make sure that a porch pirate doesn’t make off with your item or that it doesn’t roll into the street (which happened once to Lord and Silverman). But your car can’t be in the driveway. Letting the drone land in the backyard would avoid some of these problems, but not if there are trees.
Amazon has also warned customers that drone delivery is unavailable during periods of high demand for drone delivery.
The other active U.S. test site is Lockeford, California, in the Central Valley. On a recent afternoon, the Lockeford site seemed largely moribund, with only three cars in the parking lot. Amazon said it was delivering via drones in Lockeford and arranged for a New York Times reporter to come back to the site. It also arranged an interview with David Carbon, the former Boeing executive who runs the drone program. The company later canceled both without explanation.
A corporate blog post on Oct. 18 said that drones had safely delivered “hundreds” of household items in College Station since December and that customers there could now have some medications delivered. Lockeford wasn’t mentioned.
After Silverman and Lord expressed initial interest in the drone program, Amazon offered $100 in gift certificates in October 2022 to follow through. But their service didn’t start until June, and then it was suspended during a punishing heat wave when the drones could not fly.
The incentives, however, kept coming. The couple got an email recently from Amazon pushing Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter, which usually costs $5.38 but was a “free gift” while supplies lasted. They ordered it, and a little while later, a drone dropped a big box containing a small jar. Amazon said “some promotional items” are being offered “as a welcome.”
“We don’t really need anything they offer for free,” said Silverman, a 51-year-old novelist and caregiver. “The drones feel more like a toy than anything — a toy that wastes a huge amount of paper and cardboard.”
The Texas weather plays havoc with important deliveries. Lord, a 54-year-old professor of civil engineering at Texas A&M, ordered a medication through the mail. By the time he retrieved the package, the drug had melted. He’s hopeful that the drones can eventually handle problems like this.
“I still view this program positively, knowing that it is in the experimental phase,” he said.
Amazon said the drones will improve over time. It announced a new model, the MK30, last year and released pictures in October. The MK30, which is slated to begin service by the end of 2024, was touted as having a greater range, an ability to fly in inclement weather and a 25% reduction in “perceived noise.”
When Amazon began working on drones years ago, the retailer took two or three days to ship many items to customers. It worried that it was vulnerable to potential competitors whose vendors were more local, including Google and eBay. Drones were all about speed.
“We can do half-hour delivery,” Bezos promised on “60 Minutes.”
For a while, drones were the next big thing. Google developed its own drone service, Wing, which now works with Walmart to deliver items in parts of Dallas and Frisco, Texas. Startups got funding; about $2.5 billion was invested between 2013 and 2019, according to the Teal Group, an aerospace consultancy. Veteran venture capitalist Tim Draper said in 2013 that “everything from pizza delivery to personal shopping can be handled by drones.” Uber Eats announced a food delivery drone in late 2019. The future was up in the air.
Amazon started thinking really long term. It envisioned and got a patent for a drone resupply vehicle that would hover in the sky at 45,000 feet. That’s above commercial airplanes, but Amazon said it could use the vehicles to deliver customers a hot dinner.
Yet on the ground, progress was slow — sometimes for technical reasons and sometimes because of the company’s corporate DNA. The same aggressive confidence that created a trillion-dollar business undermined Amazon’s efforts to work with the Federal Aviation Administration.
“The attitude was, ‘We’re Amazon. We’ll convince the FAA,’” said one former Amazon drone executive, who asked for anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to speak about the subject. “The FAA wants companies to come in with great humility and great transparency. That is not a strength of Amazon.”
A more complicated issue was getting the technology to the point where it was safe not just most of the time but all of the time. The first drone that lands on someone’s head or takes off clutching a cat sets the program back another decade, particularly if it is filmed.
“Part of the DNA of the tech industry is, you can accomplish things you never thought you could accomplish,” said Neil Woodward, who spent four years as a senior manager in Amazon’s drone program. “But the truth is, the laws of physics don’t change.”
Woodward, now retired, spent years at NASA in the astronaut program before moving to the private sector.
“When you work for the government, you have 535 people on your board of directors” — he was referring to Congress — “and a good chunk of them want to take your funding away because they have other priorities,” he said. “That makes government agencies very risk-averse. At Amazon, you’re given a lot of rope, but you can get out over your skis.”
In the end, there must be a market. As Woodward put it, using an old Silicon Valley cliché: “Do the dogs like the dog food? Sometimes the dogs don’t.”
Archie Conner, 82, lives a few doors down from Lord and Silverman. He sees the drones as less a retail innovation and more a marketing one.
“When you hear a drone, you naturally think about Amazon. It’s real out-of-the-box thinking, even if no one orders at all,” he said. “Drones were on the news just the other day. People say, ‘Wow, Amazon did that.’”
Conner also ordered the free Skippy peanut butter but forgot to put out the landing target, so the drone went away. Then he ordered it again. Meanwhile, an Amazon delivery person showed up with the first jar. So now he and his wife, Belinda, have two jars.
“We haven’t found much we really want to pay for,” Conner said. “But we have enjoyed the free peanut butter.”

Netflix, The DVD And Me: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: For a singular marathon of the filmmaker's work, the discs were vital amid lockdown. A look at the newly shuttered service and how other renters used it.
The death notice arrived softly one Tuesday in April, to an email alert that chimed like a chapel bell.
From: Netflix DVD
Subject: Our Final Season
To most people, Netflix's announcement that it would end its DVD-by-mail service probably had the flavor of an obituary for a forgotten actor: Wait, that guy was still alive?
It didn't land quite that way for me. I'd subscribed in 2019 after making the discovery that Netflix still offered the service, rebranded as DVD.com. I was 25 then. I wasn't really in it for nostalgia: My family had a Netflix DVD subscription for some time during its heyday in the 2000s, but I barely remember that -- we did the vast majority of renting from our local video store.
No, I subscribed because I liked the idea of a rolling queue of movies that would be sent to me proactively, eliminating the purgatorial "what should we watch tonight?" step of scrolling through streaming services. When a friend suggested something, I'd add it to the list.
In 2020 and 2021, my subscription took on a new role: helping to keep me from going stir crazy during the most cloistered months of pandemic lockdown. The DVD service was particularly handy when I decided to embark on a career-spanning marathon of all Martin Scorsese's movies. Starting with "Who's That Knocking at My Door," I worked my way through the highs ("Goodfellas," sure, but I ride for "The Age of Innocence") and the lows ("Boxcar Bertha" -- not without its charms).
As the DVD operation wound down and sent its final discs in September, I asked Netflix for some statistics to better understand how viewers used it over its 25-year run, and whether the numbers -- distilled from 5.2 billion discs shipped since 1998 -- could illuminate my own experience.
'Top Gun: Maverick'
What I found sometimes tracked with my own viewing and sometimes didn't. The most rented movie overall was "The Blind Side" (never saw it) and the most rented TV show "Dexter" (a video store rental for me in 2010). Other times, the data was just bizarre: During the final year of the service, the Tom Cruise box-office juggernaut "Top Gun: Maverick" was the No. 1 movie rental everywhere but in Washington, D.C., where the winner was, inexplicably, "Tár," the high-minded classical music drama with Cate Blanchett. (I watched both. Seeing Cruise's Maverick take a younger pilot under his wing in "Top Gun," I flashed on a hotshot Cruise being mentored by Paul Newman in Scorsese's "The Color of Money," marathon movie No. 10.)
The "Tár" outlier speaks to one of the beautiful aspects of the Netflix DVD. You weren't bombarded with what was popular or trending -- or what Netflix wanted to be popular or trending. You followed your own curiosity.
Morgan Freeman
By default, my Scorsese marathon probably makes his longtime collaborator Robert De Niro the actor whose films I rented the most. (Don't sleep on De Niro's deliciously unhinged performance in "The King of Comedy.") For all Netflix DVD users, though, De Niro rests at a healthy but comparatively modest fifth place.
Cate Blanchett
And how about my most rented actress? At first I thought Scorsese didn't have enough recurring actresses to come up with a name (that's on him!), but then I remembered that his very charming mother, Catherine, made brief appearances in many of his movies before her death in 1997. So she is probably my most rented actress.
Clint Eastwood
In the director category, Eastwood was followed by Steven Spielberg. And here, Catherine Scorsese has something to brag about: her son Marty was the third most rented filmmaker. (Of Scorsese's films, "The Departed" was the most rented. It was also the most popular movie featuring either Matt Damon or Mark Wahlberg.)
100,000-plus
6,000-7,000
The figures here hint at a key aspect of Netflix's DVD service: Unlike those of its streaming counterparts (present-day Netflix, as well as Hulu, Disney+, Apple TV+ and the like), the Netflix library wasn't limited to the movies and TV shows it had the rights to. (Netflix declined to specify how many productions it was currently streaming beyond saying that the figure was in the thousands.)
In this way, the DVD service acted more as an overstuffed old-school video store. You know the type: dingy lighting, out-of-print foreign films jammed behind a cardboard cutout of Catwoman.
The variety and breadth in those stores, and, to a somewhat lesser degree, on DVD Netflix, was vital. Even with the catalog of a director like Scorsese, certain titles are unavailable to stream in any form today. One film I couldn't get digitally and had to rent from DVD Netflix was "Kundun," Scorsese's 1997 biopic of the 14th Dalai Lama, a drama that was effectively smothered by Disney upon release in an effort to placate the Chinese government. Disney can choose not to offer "Kundun" digitally. What it can't change is that the movie was released on DVD. Without Netflix's discs, there's one less way to watch out-of-print movies like that one.
Public libraries, where you can often borrow discs for free, are an option, as are sites like eBay, where used discs abound. But in the more convenient streaming realm, audiences are at the mercy of companies' financial interests and a tangled web of rights.
'Metropolis'
'News of the World'
Comparing the most popular rental from the 1920s with the most rented 2020s movie highlights two distinct ways that subscribers used the service. They checked classics like "Metropolis" (1927), Fritz Lang's sci-fi masterpiece, off their bucket lists. And they caught up on movies they had missed on the big screen: "News of the World," a Paul Greengrass western with Tom Hanks, got a runty theatrical release in December 2020, deep in the pandemic era, no doubt increasing its popularity as a rental.
How did Scorsese do on the decade-by-decade list? Well, if it weren't for Francis Ford Coppola, he would have topped the 1970s -- Scorsese's "Taxi Driver" was the second most rented 1970s movie, behind Coppola's "The Godfather."
2021
'Yellowstone,' Season 3
In the last few years, the relative popularity on DVD Netflix of expensive-to-stream TV shows increased substantially. The most rented shows at the beginning of the 2010s were the Showtime serial-killer drama "Dexter" and the HBO vampire drama "True Blood," though HBO's fantasy heavyweight "Game of Thrones" dominated most of the decade after its arrival on DVD in 2012.
When we asked Times readers to tell us about their days as Netflix DVD subscribers, I learned that those discs were lifelines for people in all kinds of situations -- just as they were for me during the pandemic.
DVD subscriber since 2006, when I moved to a rural area from a large city and missed the art houses I patronized. I was bowled over by the special collections like ballets, foreign films and BBC stuff. -- Joan, Salem, S.C.
My husband and I had a DVD subscription to Netflix while we were stationed in Germany from 2004-7. They would ship the discs through the USPS to our military postal boxes. -- Nina Grant, Denver
If you live in hurricane country as I do, the insurance of having a few DVD movies at hand for when the cable service goes out is peace of mind, just like the whole-house generator that will power the TV and DVD player. -- Fern Bugg, Wilmington, N.C.
In the early years, I spent about half of each year in Antarctica. This started before streaming services, and once they came along, we wouldn't have been able to stream movies anyway, due to bandwidth issues. It took a long time for each new DVD to arrive, but it was better than rewatching all the old VHS tapes we had on station. -- Andy Young, Talkeetna, Alaska
Last month, I went to see Scorsese's new movie, "Killers of the Flower Moon," at an indie theater. The final disc of my marathon, the somber "Silence," had long since been returned, yet I still had Netflix on my mind. The energy in the room felt like a throwback to another time: Here was a big-budget drama from a distinguished director playing to a sold-out audience at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. But the epic was produced by Apple and bound to be viewed by many audiences through that company's streaming service, which is banking on the movie to attract new subscribers. The film was debuting in a moviegoing culture transformed by streaming and, by extension, Netflix.
In that way, watching "Killers of the Flower Moon" in a theater felt a little like going to an ailing mom-and-pop video store when Netflix's DVDs-by-mail business was ascendant: It was an act undertaken because you loved the experience, and because you weren't sure how long it would be available.
Sitting in the theater, a few weeks after Netflix's DVD service had formally ended, alongside other people who had trudged in the rain to see a Scorsese movie on opening night, our red envelope days felt both far away and very close.

Full text: Timeless décor advice, a Japanese good-luck charm -- and more recommendations from T Magazine.
Custom Carved Pendants and Rings
The intaglio -- a stone engraved with an image -- is a form of jewelry that goes back to ancient Mesopotamia. "In the Greek and Roman galleries at the Met, there's a study room that's full of intaglios," says the New York-based jewelry designer Jean Prounis. For just over a year, her namesake brand, which often references ancient decorative arts, has been creating personalized intaglios in lapis, carnelian, onyx, jade or gold that can be set as rings or spinning pendants. Once you've chosen which of the settings and stones to offer your giftee, Prounis will, she says, ask you or the betrothed a series of questions about the couple's relationship before suggesting a design, which is then etched on the stone by a specialized intaglio carver. Or she'll present a menu of options -- among them, palm trees, clasped hands and olive branches. Prounis's designs have also included pet portraits, initials and dates. "It's kind of like an anthropological study of what modern-day people want to inscribe in stone," she says. And for the newly engaged, an intaglio can also function as a wax seal: perfect for sending off invitations and thank-you notes.
Terence Conran's Timeless Décor Advice
First published almost 50 years ago, "The House Book," by the pioneering British designer Terence Conran, remains a unique source for the kind of hyper-specific interiors knowledge -- how to choose a wall color for a narrow corridor, how high to hang a painting above a sofa -- that typically only exists in the heads of seasoned professionals. There are schematics for ideal kitchen layouts and taxonomies of floor coverings and door handles. And yet the book is also, somehow, sexy. The photographs of '70s-era interiors that accompany the text include shots of London living rooms draped in Persian rugs and of people reclining on modular velvet sofas and bathing in terrazzo tubs. Conran, who founded the influential British furniture and design store Habitat, helped codify an approach to living informed by individuality and ease, and his vision of a home as a place filled with warmth and spontaneity feels like a perfect template for two people who are building one together. While the book is no longer in print, it's still easy to find; a signed first edition costs $ 590 on Chairish, but Thriftbooks and eBay have gently used versions for around $ 20.
Parisian-Made Candlesticks Paired With Colorful Tapers
I started shopping at Astier de Villatte, the Parisian company that manufactures milky ceramics by borrowing 18th-century techniques, after a couple I know who collects the stuff got engaged. But the brand's candlesticks, which come in several sizes and motifs -- from the twisty Peggy to the stolid Amalfi to the Canard, with its little duck -- are a good idea for any couple. They're sold individually, and offered at various heights and price points, so you can customize the gift in ways cheeky (a sinuous and squat one, say) or classic (a perfectly matched pair) or even get three (or more) for polyamorous folks. All are made in black terra cotta with a white enamel glaze; this season, the same bases are being incorporated into a new line of lamps (in case you want to buy something for yourself, too). But whatever you choose, don't forget to include some candles. I like the thin, colorful Danica tapers. Or, if you prefer 100 percent beeswax, get the Taper Trio from Alysia Mazzella: With its upcycled fabric wrapping, you'll have them thinking about "something new, something old, something borrowed, something blue" long before the wedding arrives.
A Lucky Charm to Hang at Home
In traditional Japanese folk art, there's an ornament made using the straw from rice that has been harvested. The green stalks are braided into ropes that are then twisted into a large, intricate knot that can't be undone called iwai musubi -- iwai meaning celebration, and musubi, knot. According to the artisans of Warazaiku Takubo, a workshop in Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan, that specializes in these woven pieces, the iwai musubi is meant to symbolize firm unity. A couple can hang the knot inside their home as a lucky charm and a wish for peace, safety and prosperity. Visit any shrine in Japan and you'll find tightly wound straw ropes marking the sacred areas to ward off evil spirits. The knots come in various shapes and sizes, but this one, made by Warazaiku Takubo and sold through the British shop Momosan, benefits from an added bit of symbolism: The tassels at the ends, called suehirogari in Japanese, flare outward, representing increased prosperity as time goes on.
An Everlasting Kitchen Companion
Salt may no longer be the luxurious commodity it once was (in ancient Greece, it was as valuable as gold), but its ubiquity means that every couple can use a salt vessel. Gift the Swedish designer Beata Heuman's playful Monster Pinch bowl, inspired by sea creatures and made in Stoke-on-Trent, a city in England that has produced pottery since the mid-17th century. The double-sided Nabra bowl from the Brooklyn-based ceramist Dina Nur Satti allows for multiple seasonings to be close at hand, setting the scene for inspired cooking, while each of Jeremy Ayers's Salt Boxes is made at his studio in Waterbury, Vt. -- an 1870 barn where his great-great-grandfather crafted carriages and sleighs. Vintage salt cellars, like these snail-shaped ones from the 1980s, are available from resale sites like Chairish, 1stDibs and eBay, and can be found in all sorts of materials and forms. Whichever you choose, package them with an usual variety of the seasoning such as South Asian Black Mineral Salt, a seasoned version with lemon from Sicily or Tuscan herbs.

Full text: Goodwill knows it needs to figure out e-commerce. At stake, the nonprofit retailer says, is its ability to generate enough revenue to fulfill its mission: providing job opportunities for those in need.
Since its founding in 1902, Goodwill's locations have been go-to spots for millions of people looking to get rid of their lightly worn clothes and rifle through the racks for other people's stuff. But when it comes to online shopping, Goodwill has a ways to go. For more than a decade, it has faced mounting competition from the likes of ThredUp, Poshmark and Etsy's Depop, online platforms specializing in previously owned clothes.
Goodwill is made up of 154 independently run organizations that have their own chief executives and control the inventory that is donated to stores in their regions. More than 100 of them use an e-commerce auction site called ShopGoodwill.com, which was started in 1999. Other locations have offloaded some of their donations on eBay.
Over the past year, a handful of Goodwills have been contributing to a new online site, GoodwillFinds.
"There's so much competition coming into the market now," Matt Kaness, chief executive of GoodwillFinds eCommerce, said. "So all the donations -- the billions of pounds of donations that Goodwill gets every year -- is now a massive market that for-profit players are targeting."
GoodwillFinds mirrors the look of many other major retailers' sites, with categories like women's and electronics and the ability for shoppers to filter their searches by brand, size and color. It also has unique sections like Heirloom-Quality Finds, and clearance.
When discussing the site, Goodwill executives toss around industry jargon and explain the ways they're improving the customer experience. They have sales targets, want to attract customers with "high lifetime value" and are monitoring the commission structure that could eventually help the website break even.
But Goodwill isn't doing this just because it wants to move into the 21st century. More than 130,000 people work across the organization, while two million people received assistance last year through its programs, which include career navigation and skills training. Those opportunities are funded through the sales of donated items.
Nowadays, people can easily get paid -- by businesses including ThredUp and the RealReal -- to offload their lightly worn T-shirts and designer bags, rather than donate them. While many devotees say it will always be easier to drop off a bag of goods at Goodwill than deal with the online consignors, the increasing competition poses a threat to the nonprofit.
Last year, the total U.S. market for secondhand retail was $ 174.1 billion, lifted by consumers' growing interest in buying sustainable options and finding ways to save money. That's expected to reach $ 258.8 billion by 2027, according to the consultancy firm GlobalData. Analysts note that Goodwill is growing more slowly than its competitors.
"We're kind of playing catch-up," Mr. Kaness said.
The stakes of getting it right are high. Last year, Goodwill helped nearly 180,000 people through its job services.
Ronnie Hunter is one of them. In February, after spending about 20 years in state prison in Illinois, Mr. Hunter returned to Chicago's Englewood neighborhood with the goal of getting a job. He knew about Goodwill stores, but it was a friend who told him that Goodwill also offered a work force development program where he could learn basic computer skills and receive a nice shirt and a tie to wear to interviews.
At first, Mr. Hunter was skeptical that it would be enough to help him overcome the hurdle of securing employment. But after completing a one-week program and then receiving mentorship from a Goodwill worker, he secured a job at a local company that reupholsters seating for transportation companies. He earns about $ 17 an hour.
Mr. Hunter is still in touch with the Goodwill employees who helped him find his footing. "Those employees over there really go the extra mile despite what you did or what you've been through," Mr. Hunter said, adding, "You walk in, it's such a warm feeling."
Continuing to help people like Mr. Hunter makes Goodwill's online strategy even more urgent. But success is far from assured. Major retailers have spent years building teams and pouring money into establishing sophisticated e-commerce operations that involve machine learning and seamless distribution channels.
Goodwill's latest e-commerce venture was in the works for a couple of years. In 2019 and 2020, Goodwill executives commissioned market research to gauge the opportunity they had online.
"It was clear as day that in terms of e-commerce, this was a booming market for resale," said Daryl Campbell, chief executive of Evergreen Goodwill in Washington State and a founding member of GoodwillFinds.
"We recognized that the Goodwill brand needed more of a centralized presence online -- kind of a stand-alone 'here's the Goodwill brand in this space' -- in order for us to be able to compete in this really rapidly growing aggressive market," he added.
Goodwill's decentralized model makes the challenge of gaining an online presence more complicated. In 1999, Goodwill of Orange County in California started Shopgoodwill.com, an auction site. That site still operates with 128 Goodwills contributing and said it had brought in more than $ 2 billion.
GoodwillFinds, which has just 14 members, has sold $ 25 million in merchandise since it started last year and has half a million subscribers, Mr. Kaness said. He said sales growth had increased 50 percent quarter over quarter.
Executives at both Shopgoodwill.com and Goodwillfinds.com said there were currently no plans to merge the sites. On Goodwill's main website, a drop-down option features both for people looking to shop online, with no direction on which one they should choose.
The charity is also contending with a marketing conundrum. Everyone knows Goodwill for one thing. How does it become top of mind when people go online?
"They are the ultimate brand name in thrifting," said Patricia Hambrick, who teaches branding, marketing and sustainability at Boston University's Questrom School of Business. Goodwill, she added, needs shoppers "to get an awareness that they actually have anything online because that's not necessarily where you would think."
As any retailer knows, it's not easy building an e-commerce website that shoppers want to go back to time and again. And one dedicated to resale presents even more hurdles. What Goodwill sells on its site is limited to donations, which are generally countercyclical. In other words, people drop off winter clothes during spring cleaning and give their shorts away just as it's getting cold.
GoodwillFinds has invested time and resources into teaching its participating members strategies for curating merchandise, taking photos and writing descriptions. Recent finds for shoppers included a 14-karat white gold diamond oval ring for about $ 1,900, a pair of red Nike high-tops for $ 46 and a Nintendo 64 for $ 95.
Items ordered off GoodwillFinds are shipped from the contributing member's region, and each distribution center operates a little differently.
"Trying to create a normalized customer experience across that environment has proven to be challenging," said Jim Davis, the chief revenue officer of GoodwillFinds. "The tools we're building out are starting to normalize for us and make it very possible."
But that costs money. Mr. Kaness, who previously was an executive at Walmart and chief executive of ModCloth and Lucky Brands, is well aware that operating a tech venture within a charitable organization is difficult. Many of the well-capitalized, publicly traded online resell sites are not profitable; Mr. Kaness said he thought it would take $ 15 million to $ 25 million of investment to get GoodwillFinds to where it could compete with them.
Outside a Goodwill location near Manhattan's Union Square on a recent afternoon, several shoppers said they were unaware the nonprofit even had a website.
Olivia Klem, 23, who dropped off five bags of donations, said she had learned about the e-commerce site when she went online to search for the nearest Goodwill donation center. She said she might use the site when looking to buy something specific rather than just browsing.
"I like the aspect of going to Goodwill and trying things on and seeing what I can find," Ms. Klem said, holding three tote bags packed with items like wooden spoons and cups she had bought after dropping off her donations.

Full text: Curators and conservators are working to save -- and update -- art made with aging hardware.
UP A BUCKLING flight of stairs on Murray Street in Lower Manhattan, the dusty workshop of CTL Electronics is crammed with once-novel relics: cathode-ray tube (CRT) televisions, three-beam projectors and laserdisc players from the previous century. Hundreds of outdated monitors are arranged beside money trees and waving maneki neko cats, an installation in a kind of mini-museum run by CTL's proprietor, Chi-Tien Lui, who has worked as a TV and radio repairman since immigrating from Taiwan in 1961. At CTL, which he opened in 1968, Lui initially sold closed-circuit TV systems and video equipment, but for the past couple of decades, his business has had a unique focus: repairing video artworks that, since the onset of the digital age, are increasingly likely to malfunction and decay.
Many of CTL's clients are museums looking to restore works by a single artist, the video art pioneer Nam June Paik, who died in 2006. Known for his sculptures and room-size installations of flickering CRT monitors, Paik began visiting the shop in the 1970s on breaks from his studio in nearby SoHo. While some conservators have updated his work by replacing old tubes with LCD screens, Lui is one of the only technicians who can rebuild Paik's sets from spare parts, as if they were new.
Paik's work was on view, along with video works from dozens of other artists, in "Signals," a sweeping exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York earlier this year. Many pieces in the show, such as those in the video collectives section, played on boxy Sony CRT monitors, long favored by artists for their austere, stackable design, and which stopped being produced in the 2000s. The cube CRTs are essentially worthless to consumers, but museums are willing to pay a premium for them on eBay -- "if you can even get your hands on one," said Stuart Comer, the chief curator of media and performance at MoMA, who helped organize the show. "I had to tell security, 'Pretend these are Donald Judds,' because they're basically priceless at this point."
It's an ongoing dilemma for the modern-art institution: New technologies are only ever new for so long. When the phaseout of the incandescent light bulb, a go-to material for artists from Robert Rauschenberg to Felix Gonzalez-Torres, began in 2012, museums either amassed stockpiles of the old bulbs or found a reliable supplier. Dan Flavin, who spent his entire career working with fluorescent light, always had his preferred manufacturers. Last year, the Biden administration proposed as part of its climate policy a sunsetting of compact fluorescents, and a few states have recently enacted legislation that in the coming years will also ban the longer tube lights that Flavin used. For now, museums continue to go through the estate of the artist, who died in 1996, to replace burned-out lights. Not all artists are so precious about their materials, however: In 2012, when Diana Thater presented her 1992 video installation "Oo Fifi, Five Days in Claude Monet's Garden" at the Los Angeles gallery 1301PE, where it had first been shown 20 years earlier, she updated its clunky CRT projectors to digital ones. She digitized the video, a collage of film footage from Monet's garden in Giverny, France -- itself a technological update of the Impressionist painter's vistas in oil -- because, she said, "I don't want my work to look fake old." Paik, for his part, left behind a page of instructions specifying that his works could be updated, as long as the integrity of the original look of the sculpture was respected, to the best of what the technology would allow.
In conserving works made with more mundane materials, museums generally rely on an artist like Thater or on the artist's estate to provide guidance -- or even the materials themselves, as is the case with Flavin. But technology now moves at a much faster pace. A museum's task of protecting art in perpetuity has remained fixed, even as artists' materials have changed. Art institutions are likely the only places in the world that are currently planning how they might be able to fix an Oculus Rift 50 years from now. Rather than keep stockpiles of expensive and obsolete technology in storage, museums have to find clever ways around software updates, from video game emulators to server farms to niche businesses like CTL. But they, too, have a life span as short as, or shorter than, those of light bulbs. There are far more obscure materials for artists to choose from than ever before.
GLENN WHARTON WAS hired in 2007 as MoMA's first conservator of time-based media, or works that often depend on commercial technology that can have a limited shelf life. "I saw the writing on the wall that it was hard to even buy videotapes anymore," Wharton said. In the early days, he was making decisions "about changing the works of art" that were the equivalent of a painting conservator using acrylic instead of oil paint: "We were swapping out CRTs and sometimes moving toward flat-screen technology, or changing projectors or even digitizing." Ultimately, Wharton decided, "defining the authentic state of a work of art is central to what conservators do." So when the museum acquired a work dependent on a specific technology from a living artist, he'd ask how they wanted it to be conserved and displayed.
Wharton now runs a program at U.C.L.A. that has helped to clarify one of the main issues in the emerging field of digital conservation: digital obsolescence. If certain art is dependent on an extinct technology, how does one preserve the art so that it outlasts the technology itself? Sometimes by addressing a phenomenon called bit rot: As Caroline Gil, the director of media collections and preservation at the New York nonprofit Electronic Arts Intermix, explained, "Digital files of all stripes are made up of data -- zeros and ones -- and, every so often, a zero can turn into a one through electrostatic discharge in your hard drive or in a big server farm. That corrupts the file." There are methods for fixing this, she said, "but that's a very niche level of understanding, and I don't think a lot of archives or collecting institutions do that, really."
Coding expertise is still uncommon in museum conservation departments, but that may have to change. "The art world is kind of running on an old operating system of Modernism," said Cass Fino-Radin, a conservator and founder of the upstate New York firm Small Data Industries, even as museums are collecting newer artworks that, at their core, are composed of code. In 2016, the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York contacted Fino-Radin for help with a two-year-long assessment of digital materials in its permanent collection. The project included a detailed case study of a defunct iOS app called Planetary, acquired by the museum in 2013, which allowed users to browse a music library like astronauts soaring through the Milky Way. Debuting in 2011, Planetary had been rendered incompatible with iOS software updates within a few years, so the museum decided to share the source code on GitHub for anyone to try to fix it. Ultimately, it was an Australian developer, Kemal Enver, who got it functioning again, releasing it in 2020 as Planetary Remastered. To Fino-Radin, it was a warning sign: "For museums, hiring a professional software developer to do that kind of annual maintenance isn't something that's ever been remotely needed in history, and so institutions just don't have the money to do it. It's a new line item in their budgets."
For works dependent on old hardware, conservators sometimes rely on a method known as emulation: "You're fooling a current computer into thinking that it's running on an older system, meaning I can turn my MacBook Pro into a virtual machine where I can run a net art piece in a Netscape 1.1 browser," said Christiane Paul, the curator of digital art at the Whitney Museum of American Art. This approach was adopted at Rhizome, a New York nonprofit dedicated to promoting and preserving digital art, which in 2012 presented (along with the New Museum of Contemporary Art) an online exhibition of interactive computer games for preteen girls co-created by Theresa Duncan that had first been released on CD-ROM in the mid-1990s. Visitors to the Rhizome website can play Chop Suey, a delirious adventure through a small Ohio town, by connecting virtually to a server running the game on its 1995 software.
Many artists don't think about what will happen to their work when they are gone. Or they never imagined certain pieces having much of a future. In "Super Mario Clouds" (2002), an early video installation by the artist Cory Arcangel, the 1985 Super Mario Bros. video game plays off a Nintendo console with all of the game's animated features, apart from sky and clouds, erased. Obsolescence was partly the point of the work because, as a then-unknown artist, Arcangel didn't expect to be showing it 20 years later -- and by 2002 the consoles "were considered trash," he said. An edition of "Super Mario Clouds" was bought by the Whitney, whose conservators were aware that the console might not function much longer. But the source code remains available, and Arcangel has granted the museum permission to use a Nintendo emulator to show the work.
Yet is an emulated artwork, even if indistinguishable from the original, really the same artwork? This riddle is sometimes known as the paradox of Theseus's ship: According to Plutarch's legend, as the Athenians preserved their former king's boat through the decades by gradually replacing its decaying old planks with new ones, philosophers wondered, could the ship still be considered authentic if none of its original parts remained?
The conundrum is why some artists and conservators have now incorporated outwitting obsolescence into their practices. Lynn Hershman Leeson, an 82-year-old artist who was a contemporary of Paik's, has been working with A.I. technology since the late 1990s and in 1983 made one of the first interactive video art pieces: "Lorna," created originally for a groundbreaking new technology called laserdisc. Twenty years later, she upgraded to another now-bygone technology -- the DVD. Lately, she's been experimenting with a futuristic method of archiving her work. Looking to preserve a series of videos and documents from her research on genetic manipulation and synthetic biology, she turned to a technology at once far older and more cutting-edge than anything else on the market: DNA. Hershman Leeson first converted her research into a video timeline on Final Cut Pro, and then enlisted Twist Bioscience in San Francisco, which manufactures DNA products, to chemically synthesize it into a sequence. The resulting genetic material is kept in two vials in her studio, as well as in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany. "DNA has a 500-year half-life," she said. "I also saw it as a metaphor, a poetic conclusion to all of this work, to create something that's relatively invisible and holds our past and our future."
The problem is, neither Hershman Leeson nor the museums that collect her work are able to retrieve it from the sequence. In theory, the process is reversible, but it's also expensive and time-consuming. At least for now, the work belongs to the future.

Full text: Solar eclipses aren't a regular occurrence in North America. So it's remarkable that we'll get an opportunity to see two different types in the span of only six months. The first, on Oct. 14, will be an annular eclipse. The moon will pass in front of the sun, but it won't completely eclipse it, leaving a thin rim of sun exposed -- a phenomenon known as the "Ring of Fire." The second, which will take place on April 8, 2024, will be a total solar eclipse, during which the moon will block the sun completely for four and a half minutes.
Without protection, bright sunlight focused on your retina will damage (and perhaps even destroy) your eyes' light-sensitive rod and cone cells, said Rick Fienberg of the American Astronomical Society. Use these tips for safe eclipse viewing. ELISSA SANCI
Use only certified eclipse viewers. Ordinary sunglasses -- even those with very dark lenses -- let in too much light to view the sun safely. Solar eclipse glasses that are properly made and certified to meet the ISO 12312-2 international safety standard reduce the sun's brightness by a factor of about 500,000, making the sun appear about as bright as the full moon, Mr. Fienberg said. Make sure whatever you get has the ISO certification clearly stamped on the package.
Shop for eclipse viewers from vetted sellers. The lead-up to the total solar eclipse in August 2017 brought a rise in counterfeit, uncertified eclipse viewers for sale through online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay. We recommend buying your eclipse gear directly from a reputable manufacturer or a certified seller to ensure that they meet the safety standard. The AAS offers a list of vetted manufacturers and resellers on its website.
Ensure your binoculars and cameras are fitted with certified filters. If you're viewing the sun through a device with optical lenses, such as a set of binoculars, a telescope or a DSLR camera, make sure that filters are placed in front of the objective lenses (the lenses at the end of the binoculars), rather than in front of the lenses you peer through -- otherwise you risk permanent eye damage, Mr. Fienberg warned.
Wear eclipse viewers at all times during an annular or partial eclipse. During these types of eclipses, the moon never fully covers the sun, leaving the rim of the sun visible. So it's not safe at any stage to look at it without using protection.

New York Man Charged With Smuggling $200,000 Worth of Butterflies and Bugs: [National Desk]

Full text: Deceased, protected "birdwing" butterflies were among the insects Charles Limmer shipped into and out of the United States, federal prosecutors said.
A Long Island man was charged on Tuesday with smuggling $ 200,000 worth of deceased, protected butterflies, including exceptionally large ones known as birdwings, and other insects into and out of the United States.
The man, Charles Limmer, 75, sought to conceal the smuggling scheme by conspiring with others to label the illegal shipments as "decorative wall coverings," "origami paper craft" and "wall decorations," according to a six-count federal indictment filed in the Eastern District of New York.
The indictment says that Mr. Limmer expressed contempt for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, an agency that, among other things, enforces regulations related to wildlife shipments. "Screw USFWS," he wrote in an exchange with a co-conspirator, according to the indictment.
Mr. Limmer had not been arraigned as of Tuesday. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of smuggling, prosecutors said.
Contacted at his home in Commack, N.Y., he declined to comment on the charges. He said he was a lepidopterist -- someone who studies or collects butterflies and moths -- "by profession and by training" and "more of a conservationist than any employee who ever worked for Fish and Wildlife."
He referred all other questions to a lawyer, Renee Wong. She declined to comment.
According to the indictment, Mr. Limmer obtained a federal license to import and export wildlife commercially in 2016. The wildlife service suspended the license last October, the indictment says; it does not explain why.
From then until last month, the indictment says, Mr. Limmer used online platforms to sell wildlife he had imported illegally to customers around the world. On Tuesday, he had various butterflies, moths and beetles listed for sale on Etsy, eBay and InsectNet at a range of prices. Buyers typically pin and frame the insects for display.
In addition to federal smuggling laws, Mr. Limmer is accused of flouting a 1973 agreement signed by 184 international parties that is meant to ensure the global trade in animals and plants does not put their survival in the wild at risk.
Species covered by the agreement, the indictment says, include birdwing butterflies. The name stems from their majestic size, angular wings and birdlike flight. Their dimensions make birdwings, vividly colored natives of places like Papua New Guinea and Australia, popular with butterfly collectors, the indictment says.
Last month, according to the indictment, Mr. Limmer received two birdwings in a package from the Solomon Islands and listed them for sale the same day for about $ 480.
Birdwing smuggling cases are unusual, but not unheard-of, court records show.
In 2016, a California man pleaded guilty to violating the federal Endangered Species Act after he was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport trying to bring dozens of the protected butterflies into the country from Japan. In 2007, a Japanese man who admitted to smuggling birdwings into the United States was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison.
The indictment against Mr. Limmer seeks the forfeiture of more than 1,000 butterflies, moths, cicadas and other insects. Many have already been seized, the indictment indicates, mostly in New York, except for two dried butterflies in Honolulu and 200 white witch moths in Miami.

Accidentally Bought, Expertly Rebuilt: [Correction]

Full text: After becoming the inadvertent owners of a crumbling building in rural Scotland, a couple spent five years reviving it. With a little help.
One morning this past June, Claire Segeren and Cal Hunter received legal permission to live in their own home. It had only taken five years.
The couple had spent that time renovating their house in the Scottish village of Sandbank, about 35 miles west of Glasgow, after buying it in 2018. With limited funds, they became their own contractors, painstakingly rebuilding the 120-year-old red-sandstone house nearly from the ground up in an effort to restore its turn-of-the-century glory.
"When we got the sign-off" from local building authorities, Mr. Hunter said, "it did feel like a real milestone. We both just crashed."
This had not been the plan when they first set out to buy a place in Scotland. But of course, not many people buy houses accidentally.
As the story goes, Ms. Segeren, then 24, was visiting family in her native Toronto when her boyfriend, Mr. Hunter, then 26, attended a home auction in Glasgow. The couple's intention was to buy an investment apartment near the city center that they could renovate and flip. But Mr. Hunter mistakenly bid on the wrong lot. There were no photos of the 1,940-square-foot Victorian-style home in the auction brochure, though it did describe it as "requiring modernization throughout."
"I thought, with that price for a flat, how can you go wrong? Why not give it a go?" said Mr. Hunter, who hails from the English port city of Hull.
By the time he realized his mistake, he was the owner of Jameswood Villa, with a winning bid of 10,000 British pounds (about $ 12,400). Or rather, the owner of a quarter of it -- he had actually bought one of four flats in the building, which was derelict and on the verge of collapse. All the other occupants had long since abandoned it.
When Mr. Hunter called the auction house, he was offered a second unit in the building that had failed to sell at the same auction. He accepted it, thinking that owning half the house was better than a quarter. "We'd borrowed the money from Claire's parents," he said. "I felt a responsibility to make it work."
Jameswood Villa sat in the northwestern peninsula area of Scotland, a pastoral landscape dotted with green and gray hills, on the outskirts of the lakeside town of Dunoon. As soon as Mr. Hunter saw it, he knew he had made the right mistake.
"I was drawn to the idea of being mortgage-free in my 30s and having a beautiful place with a nice garden," he said. "I knew it would be hard work, but we'd really been wanting an opportunity."
The building had been condemned. But Mr. Hunter is a carpenter by trade, and with support from some gas and electrical professionals -- and, eventually, dozens of helpers -- he and Ms. Segeren decided they could revive it themselves. They wound up spending three winters living in a camper van beside the property as they worked, showering in a temporary space inside the house where the icy wind would rattle through.
"We've been working five and a half days a week, most weeks, for the whole project," Ms. Segeren said recently.
This summer, inspectors declared the property safe for habitation -- a new chapter for a home that has already lived a very long life.
Documents show that the developer, Dougal McVicar, bought a 0.28-acre plot from a wealthy landowner family, the Hunters of Hafton, and built the house around 1901. Jameswood Villa was never occupied as a single-family house and seems to have always been subdivided, according to Derek Darkins, a local historian.
By the time Mr. Hunter and Ms. Segeren bought their portion of it, everyone was gone. The couple's 79-year-old neighbor, Anne Currie, helped to fill in some of the gaps. She was friendly with Jameswood's last resident, who left after it was repossessed in 1998.
"They actually had it quite nice," Ms. Currie said. "They had put love into the house. It's a sad story. It started leaking from the roof and it would have been fine if there were other tenants."
She watched the building disintegrate over the years, becoming an extreme example of the many empty homes found not only in this bucolic area, but across Scotland. (According to figures published by the Scottish government, 42,865 homes sat empty for six months or longer in 2022.)
Dunoon, the main town on the northern Scottish peninsula of Cowal, has seen its share of forgotten homes through the years. In the 19th century, developers built houses along the Holy Loch coastline to meet demand for holiday properties among Glasgow's elite.
"The proliferation of these properties for the well-heeled also created a need for accommodation for the employees who would service these new houses and their growing communities," Mr. Darkins said. "Jameswood Villa was part of this process."
The town reached its zenith in the 1960s, when the Holy Loch became home to a U.S. Navy base, leading to the influx of some 3,000 service members and their families. But 30 years later, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the U.S. Navy closed the base, shutting down the area's main economic engine.
"A lot of people made a lot of money with the Americans," Ms. Currie said. "When they left, that's when the place went down."
Buyers like Ms. Segeren and Mr. Hunter are now helping to resuscitate the area once again, but they're not doing it alone. After they bought Jameswood Villa, they met with Kelly Ferns, an empty homes officer with the Scottish Empty Homes Partnership.
Ms. Ferns helped them track down the owner of one remaining flat, enabling them to buy it for £10,000. The couple had already acquired the third unit months before for the same price; the owner, who'd bought it at the same auction, came to view the property and immediately decided to sell it.
Once Ms. Segeren and Mr. Hunter had obtained the entire property, Ms. Ferns was able to provide them with a £10,000 grant -- "the maximum amount they qualified for as owner-occupiers," Ms. Ferns said.
Ms. Segeren recalled their first meeting with Ms. Ferns: "She said, how are you going to live during the project? How are you going to make money? And how are you going to do the project by yourselves?"
Ms. Segeren left the meeting rattled. "She asked the right questions," she said. "We didn't really have the right answers. But we needed somebody to tell it to us like it was. She taught us how to look after a traditionally built home."
The first few months were overwhelming. But when the couple received the first structural report, there was some relief: For every problem, there was a solution. It was the road map to their renovation.
They were resourceful, calling friends and relatives for tips and advice, reading building codes and books on sustainable construction. YouTube was a valuable resource for tutorials on how to slate the roof. When cash ran low, Mr. Hunter took on carpentry contracts and Ms. Segeren found work at local pubs.
The first step was to repair the roof and stop water from leaking in. They ordered scaffolding from eBay. "We did the roof structure first so we weren't getting rained on, and then went from the ground up," Ms. Segeren said. "After that, it sort of started to feel like a normal renovation."
They cleared the interior, filled with rotten and broken furniture, remnants of past lives. "There were big holes everywhere," Mr. Hunter said. "All the ceilings had fallen down, so you were walking on the plaster."
Their commitment to sustainability led the couple to reclaim materials where possible, like the sheep's wool insulation they used in the walls, and low-embodied energy materials such as bricks and timber. Ms. Segeren said the wood floor boards came from a man who'd salvaged the material from a carpet factory. "He was selling it for nine pounds a square meter, which is less than you can get cheap vinyl for," she said. "It was such a good deal."
They also raided a similar house in the area that was set for demolition. They were invited to take whatever they wanted and managed to rescue doors, architraves and wood paneling.
The cast-iron radiators were sourced from eBay. "We paint stripped them, my dad painted them for us, and him and Cal plumbed them in," Ms. Segeren said.
That's about when the cavalry showed up. After Mr. Hunter was interviewed by a reporter from the Dunoon Observer in 2019, the article went viral and offers of salvaged items for the house -- tools, supplies, old toilets and sinks -- began pouring in.
As the work stretched on, they needed extra hands but couldn't afford to hire tradespeople. So they joined the online platform Workaway, which connects people seeking a working holiday experience with people who need help. Guests are expected to work five hours a day in exchange for food and shelter.
In 2021, a then 19-year-old Charli Kleeman, who was living in Leeds, discovered the Jameswood Villa project on Workaway. A few weeks later, Ms. Segeren and Mr. Hunter picked up Mx. Kleeman at the Dunoon ferry terminal.
"I remember thinking it was beautiful because the garden had this really rustic handmade kitchen and it was so full of love," they said recently over Zoom.
At night, Mx. Kleeman slept in one of three tents set up in the garden, along with two other Workawayers. During the day they were assigned to flooring after being trained to cut and lay wooden boards. "I was a tiny piece of the puzzle," they said. "I laid the floors in two rooms."
Mx. Kleeman stayed for two and a half weeks, but the experience changed their life. "I ended up going back quite a lot, and I ended up moving to Glasgow," they said. "I don't have to do an office job. This is an option of life. It opened my mind up to alternative ways of making a living."
Mx. Kleeman is one of many people who have been inspired by Ms. Segeren and Mr. Hunter's journey. An Instagram account set up to document their project now has more than 300,000 followers. Some post advice and words of encouragement, while do-it-yourself enthusiasts share experiences. When followers asked how they could send financial support, the pair launched a GoFundMe account that raised £20,000.
"My friends in Canada say it's so funny -- that of all the people who were likely to become influencers or Instagrammers, they didn't see it for me," Ms. Segeren said.
After spending around £80,000 on the renovation, the couple are ready for the next phase: using the downstairs apartments as short-term rentals in an effort to recoup some of the money they borrowed. The rate: £125 a night, with a seven-day stay for £700. They will reside in the three-bedroom apartment upstairs.
"We definitely didn't realize how long it would take" Ms. Segeren said. "Even at the final stages we're like, 'It'll take a month and we'll be done. And then two months later, you're like, 'Why are we still working on this house?"

Academy Replaces Missing Historic Oscar Plaque: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The plaque that McDaniel, the first Black winner of an Academy Award, bequeathed to Howard University has been missing for about 50 years. Now a replacement is on its way.
After becoming the first Black person to win an Academy Award, in 1940, Hattie McDaniel called the plaque she received a cherished beacon for all that could be accomplished.
McDaniel had earned the award for her portrayal of Mammy, an agreeable slave at the whim of Scarlett O'Hara in "Gone With the Wind," a movie that arrived as a cinematic triumph but has since been rebuked for its blind eye toward slavery.
Before dying in 1952, McDaniel deflected the criticism she received for taking many stereotypical roles throughout her career.
"I'd rather play a maid than be one," she would say, envisioning that her work would open better doors for future Black actors. She also had an eternal resting spot in mind for that beacon, bequeathing the Oscar plaque to Howard University in Washington.
But for about 50 years, McDaniel's plaque has been missing, a cinematic void that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is now filling. The university will receive a replacement plaque this weekend in a ceremony titled "Hattie's Come Home."
"It's 100 percent overdue," said Jill Watts, the author of "Hattie McDaniel: Black Ambition, White Hollywood." "It was so meaningful historically as an award. Not just in the history of film, but also within American history and it was meaningful to her personally. She would be absolutely delighted to know that it's going home to where she wanted it to be."
Kevin Goff, McDaniel's great-grandnephew, said that his father started petitioning for a replacement plaque in the 1990s, and that the decision would help cement McDaniel's legacy.
Over the years, theories have circulated about the whereabouts of the plaque, which was given to all supporting acting winners from 1936 to 1942 rather than traditional Oscar statues. A spokesman for Howard University did not respond to a request for comment.
Goff said there were rumors that the plaque was stolen during student unrest about the university's mission in the late 1960s.
"Apparently, a gentleman said he had thrown it in the Potomac," he said. "Someone said maybe a drama professor took it with him. But none of it has been verified or proven. It's never shown up on eBay. So, here we are 50-plus years later and no one has a clue where it is or if it still does exist."
W. Burlette Carter, a professor at George Washington University's law school, wrote a paper about the missing award more than a decade ago. Her best guess is that it may still be somewhere at Howard, misplaced during a move by the drama department.
"That makes sense to me, having worked at a university, that when they moved the department, it got packed and it got lost," Watts said. "I have this feeling that it's probably still someplace, tucked away in a box."
Watts said she and several others approached the Academy about replacing the Oscar following her book's publication in 2005. "We were told no," Watts said. "Just a flat no."
That stance has shifted. The replacement plaque will soon reside at the Chadwick A. Boseman College of Fine Arts.
Jacqueline Stewart, the president of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, and Bill Kramer, the chief executive of the Academy, said in a news release that the upcoming ceremony would celebrate McDaniel's remarkable craft and historic win.
"Hattie McDaniel," they said, "was a groundbreaking artist who changed the course of cinema and impacted generations of performers who followed her."

Full text: This past summer, Britain's defense minister at the time, Ben Wallace, chided Ukraine for not showing enough gratitude for the West's weapons supplies. "We're not Amazon," he said.
No, but there is a kind of Amazon for the Ukrainian military, in analog form: a network of civilian volunteer groups that deliver an array of goods to soldiers in the field, on request.
I know because I'm one of those volunteers. We deliver tourniquets, chest seals for lung wounds, observation drones, night vision monoculars, power banks, underwear and feet warmers, all within a few days. A secondhand four-wheel-drive vehicle or a thermal drone takes a little longer, up to two weeks.
Volunteerism has played a powerful role in Ukraine's recent history. Volunteers maintained the barricades during the 2014 revolution on Maidan Square, and many of the fighters resisting the Russian move into Donbas later that year were civilians. When Russia launched its full invasion in 2022, large numbers of Ukrainians volunteered to fight. Millions of Ukrainians have in turn mobilized to support those men and women: An opinion poll conducted that summer, when the economy was already suffering from Russian attacks, found 86 percent of Ukrainians had donated to charities and 33 percent were actively volunteering.
Supplying the army quickly, often with imported items, could not easily be done otherwise: The military's lingering post-Soviet bureaucracy makes reacting to its own soldiers' needs difficult. Soldiers get kitted out with gear when they sign up, but lost or damaged items, from socks to helmets, are not automatically replaced. The Defense Ministry is busy dealing with big-ticket items, distributing tanks and heavy weapons coming in from all over the world.
That's how we, the volunteers, ended up fund-raising and supplying so many essential bits and pieces through ad hoc arrangements with parts of the Ukrainian military. In the grand scheme of things, our individual efforts are minuscule, but they are lifesaving all the same.
Two of the biggest nonstate volunteer groups, Come Back Alive and the Serhiy Prytula Charitable Foundation, provide cars and armored vehicles, night- and thermal-vision instruments, drones and other items to the army. Odesa-based Wave91 alone supplies hundreds of Chinese-made Mavic camera drones and fabricates thousands of first-person-view drones.
My most recent delivery was to the 3017th Military Unit of the Ukrainian National Guard.
The 3017th fought for some five months in Bakhmut this year and was recently stationed near Zolochiv, north of Kharkiv, 10 miles from the Russian border. With this information in hand, I start off in a Mitsubishi pickup truck bought in Britain with money raised in Poland. The steering wheel is on the right side, but I learned to drive British-style vehicles on my last delivery, a Nissan pickup that I took to soldiers in Odesa.
I pick up the vehicle in Berlin. On the Polish side of the Rava Ruska border crossing into Ukraine, I am waved through. On the Ukrainian side, the customs officers know me from previous deliveries, so things go smoothly there, too. An hour later in Lviv I meet up with Olga Shpak, a biologist specializing in whales who abandoned her research, friends and apartment in Moscow two days before the invasion to return to her native Kharkiv. She now is a representative there for another volunteer group, Assist Ukraine, co-founded by the retired NPR journalist Anne Garrels.
Small and flexible groups like these are crucial in this war because the big international humanitarian organizations shy away from anything remotely military. Even a lifesaving tourniquet smells martial to them. But, as Ms. Garrels said soon after the invasion, Ukrainians "don't need teddy bears, they need flak jackets."
Ms. Shpak is a one-stop supplier for the military units she knows. Their needs range from dry showers and insect repellent to night-vision devices. She finds the product on the market -- in Ukraine or abroad, via the producer or online -- and buys it with funds from Assist Ukraine or similar groups, and then organizes the delivery. "Can you urgently find a sturdy pickup for the 3017th?" she had texted me. Soon, it was in the unit's shopping cart.
Now, in a convoy of two we go -- a whale expert and a writer -- to Zolochiv to hand over the Mitsubishi and tourniquets to the National Guard unit. Ms. Shpak deals with paperwork for the vehicle, while I am given a tour of the unit's living quarters by Dima, the 26-year-old commander of the 150-soldier unit. We film a short "thank you" video of the vehicle's transfer for the main donors. Volunteer work is based on mutual trust, so filming deliveries is a form of accountability.
Along with being an accidental procurement assistant, I am also a fund-raiser: I raise money from a motley group. I reached out to Swedes through a Stockholm-based journalist. A Jewish group from New York contributed over $ 5,000. An exiled Russian-born film director and her colleagues sent even more. An Australian friend reached out to a wealthy acquaintance, who wired $ 5,000 on his way to visit Antarctica.
The next morning, back in Kharkiv, we swing by Ms. Shpak's warehouse, where she has squirreled away all sorts of goodies: medicine, uniforms, backpacks, flashlights, batteries, binoculars. She prepares herself like a military Santa Claus, stuffing boxes and bags with what she will distribute to the soldiers. She assigns me the task of sorting by size 100 colorful boxer briefs sewn by Ukrainian refugees in Austria.
That afternoon, we drive about three hours to Kramatorsk, where we meet our first taker: Gena, a former hair dye producer, who is now a soldier in the 225th Battalion. Along with some boxers, he takes power banks and special multilayered survival blankets that serve not so much to provide warmth as to conceal positions from the Russians' thermal cameras. The star of this delivery is a Mavic-3 drone that I bought on eBay in the United States.
Recently, units' requests have been getting more eclectic -- and more desperate. For my next delivery, we are now shopping for four-pronged spider boots, which provide some protection from mines, and hoverboards, which can be used to build demining robots. Both items point to the increasingly urgent effort to reduce injuries and deaths from Russian mines.
I for one have never seen a war effort -- and I have reported on several dozen conflicts -- relying so much on volunteerism, although a similar spirit fueled the Solidarity revolution in my native Poland.
The Ukrainians are committed because their lives depend on it. In order not to run out of people to defend their country, they do whatever they can to support those on the front lines. So, many civilians in Ukraine find it easier to be volunteers than to do nothing at all.
As for me, a journalist who has thrown impartiality to the winds, I feel a little less guilty knowing I tried to do something to stop this madness. So once in a while I bring supplies, always for small groups, always items that were specifically requested. I'm just fulfilling orders.

What Kind of Person Spends $1,000 On an SS Bowl?: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At the Ohio Valley Military Society's annual Show of Shows, there is plenty for sale that isn't Nazi memorabilia. All sorts of mementos from all sorts of wars: Civil War caps, antique pistols, Purple Hearts, samurai swords, World War I trench kits. But there is a lot of Nazi memorabilia.
At this year's Show of Shows, which took place in February in the Kentucky Exposition Center in Louisville, there were nearly 2,000 tables, and my best guess is that at least half had Nazi items -- and often only Nazi items -- for sale. There were Nazi flags, busts, helmets, Lugers, cutlery, batons, an autographed photo of Hitler. A small brass swastika pin could be picked up for $ 20; an SS serving bowl with gold engraving, $ 1,000; a yellow- and white-gold Luftwaffe Pilot Observer badge adorned with 170 diamonds, $ 130,000.
For a while I shadowed a tall, affable dealer from Belgium who specialized in badges and who'd already spent nearly all of the $ 100,000 in cash he'd brought with him. He stopped at one table and efficiently inspected a couple of dozen Nazi-era Iron Crosses, whispering to me which were fake or had been modified, before settling on one he liked, or at least thought worth the $ 500 he paid for it.
I'd gone to the Show of Shows, the largest military memorabilia show in the country, because I wanted to better understand the trade in Nazi artifacts, to try to get a sense of these collectors, their motivations. The market for Nazi mementos is thriving -- annual sales are, according to one expert, as high as $ 100 million -- and in the United States nothing about it is illegal. (Many other countries, particularly in Europe, do have regulations, though generally they have to do with the display of Nazi symbols, not trade or possession.) It isn't conducted in the shadows or on the dark web or only at specialty shows or only in Kentucky. Nazi items are openly sold by dealers and auction houses countrywide, at trade shows and in storefronts and online.
From Wehrmacht epaulets and belt buckles to Hitler's top hat and Eva Braun's underwear, if an object played a material role in the Third Reich, no matter how incidental, no matter how banal or bizarre, then it's probably for sale. Items that allegedly belonged to or were touched by or are otherwise imbued with the spirit of a major Nazi personality, most often Hitler, can be exorbitantly expensive (even though most of these relics have an extremely questionable provenance). Last year, a watch supposedly worn by Hitler went for $ 1.1 million at auction.
For years I've seen up close the pull Nazi artifacts can exert. I've spent time with Polish treasure hunters seeking, and occasionally finding, any variety of objects left behind by the Nazis. But I hadn't understood how pervasive the trade was -- hadn't understood, in fact, that it was a trade, how thoroughly these artifacts had been commodified. And I certainly hadn't realized how the big the market was here, in the United States.
What opened my eyes was learning how much Nazi stuff there was on LiveAuctioneers, the pre-eminent online platform for antiques dealers. According to a Times Opinion analysis, the site has published more than 30,000 listings for Nazi memorabilia in the past 15 years, making it probably the biggest, and certainly the most mainstream, purveyor of Nazi artifacts in the country. Although LiveAuctioneers' policy prohibits "items that glorify or otherwise capitalize on human tragedy with no regard or sensitivity to the suffering caused by such events," genuine Nazi artifacts are generally exempt, as they're considered "historical." (Most other major platforms have enacted more stringent policies. EBay, for example, bars any item that bears a swastika, with some exceptions for currency, stamps, historically accurate models and dioramas and photos, books and art, as well as items that predate 1933.)
Only occasionally does the market make news -- a journalist stumbles into a shop that hosts an auction selling Nazi-related paraphernalia or an auction attracts attention because it's being held on Yom Kippur. And every once in a while it comes to light that someone of note has a collection of Nazi artifacts. Most recently, there was Harlan Crow, the billionaire benefactor of Justice Clarence Thomas. Mr. Crow's collection is reported to include a couple of Hitler paintings, Nazi linens and a signed copy of "Mein Kampf."
News that someone is into Nazi memorabilia or more generally that there's a ready supply of and demand for Nazi memorabilia is met, predictably, with widespread outrage (if perhaps also with some measure of titillation). If no one seems all that shocked that it's legal -- the sanctity of the First Amendment is baked deep into the American psyche -- then I think it's fair to say that people are upset, or at least weirded out, that such items are bought and sold, promoted, profited from, and treasured. People cannot imagine how any non-Nazi could be into this stuff, with the corollary that anyone who is into this stuff must be a Nazi or basically a Nazi or is sufficiently Nazi-philic to warrant extreme suspicion.
The criticism and commentary are especially charged nowadays, given the increasing visibility of racist and antisemitic sentiment and rhetoric and violence, of emboldened neo-Nazis and white supremacists; downplaying the trafficking and promotion of anything Nazi as innocuous or ironic or someone's innocent hobby feels, to many, stupid and dangerous.
This is a valid and justifiable response -- it's an excellent rule of thumb, to be on the side that's against Nazis -- but at the same time it strikes me as incomplete. It does not reckon with who the collectors are or why they collect nor does it address the principles the market is built on, or what it in fact espouses.
The truth is that many collectors of Nazi memorabilia are, in fact, collectors, a term I'm using semi-technically to describe those who dedicate themselves, often obsessively and for reasons inscrutable to the outsider, to amassing some or other class of objects, usually something interestingly varied in terms of condition, provenance and rareness -- action figures, stamps, coins, Pez dispensers. This isn't to say there's never a profit motive, but there is, or at least at some point was, a base desire on the part of collectors to, simply, possess.
"There's a lot to collect," Michael Hughes, the author of "The Anarchy of Nazi Memorabilia: From Things of Tyranny to Troubled Treasure," told me. "Absolutely, Nazi memorabilia appeals to the systematic collector who collects complete series, like baseball cards." Dr. Hughes, an academic who describes himself as a "reformed collector" and who has interviewed or otherwise interacted with hundreds of collectors of Nazi memorabilia, says most aren't all that strange or exceptional, at least with respect to the larger collecting community. "Generally the people I have met over the last 30 years are just your average Joes," he said.
As one collector put it to me: "I have more in common with a Beanie Babies enthusiast than I do with a neo-Nazi." The man with perhaps the most valuable Nazi memorabilia collection in the United States also has what is likely the most extensive collection of "Back to the Future" memorabilia, including a DeLorean used onscreen in "Back to the Future Part III."
Of course it matters to the collectors a great deal that these objects are historical. It's a big part of the appeal, that nerding out on World War II; it's the lens they insist on viewing these objects through -- Nazi artifacts are, they argue, just an unspecial subcategory of militaria -- and in turn how they defend their practice, as a hobby, an obsession, even a form of connoisseurship that is about the furtherance of a sort of hands-on historical knowledge.
This is also effectively the stance of LiveAuctioneers as to why Nazi artifacts don't contravene its policy regarding hateful items: that these are material remnants from a particular place and particular time, interesting and desirable strictly as artifacts, and sterile with respect to contemporary politics or ideology.
There are collectors of Nazi memorabilia who are Jewish, whose relatives died in the Holocaust. None were eager to speak with me on the record -- not because they thought they were doing anything shameful but because, as one told me, "Most people don't get it, and will never get it" -- but made it clear that their fascination with Nazi artifacts in no way diluted their completely standard views regarding World War II, Nazis and the Holocaust. (When a friend of mine, who is Jewish and who's been keenly interested in the Holocaust his entire life, heard I was at the Show of Shows, he asked me to pick him up a badge once worn by a member of the SS, the Nazi regime's most significant paramilitary arm, explaining that he enjoyed imagining how the German officer who originally wore the thing would react to the fact that it was now being stored in a Jew's underwear drawer.) The Nazi object's sinisterness is not ignored but is definitely not a deterrent; if anything, it makes it more interesting. One collector I spoke to explained it in terms of "Star Wars": Which is more compelling, he asked, the Light Side or the Dark Side?
Many collectors ascribe to Nazi artifacts the moral status of war trophies, plunder from a fallen enemy. Victorious American soldiers marched in and filled their pockets with Nazi goods, because they wanted mementos, because they were greedy, because that's the way of war -- this seems to be the preferred origin story as to how any given artifact came on the market -- and any ideological ickiness thus drained away. No one would accuse those victorious American soldiers, no matter how extensive the collection, of being too into Nazis. And that decontaminated status, the collectors insist, is fixed. Even decades later, these aren't symbols of Nazism, but souvenirs of its downfall.
This apologia is widespread. Right by the entrance of the Show of Shows, there was a large placard of two American servicemen standing atop a Nazi flag and examining Nazi weapons, with a caption saying, "These objects hold the interest of collectors today for the same reasons that our serviceman took them during and after the war: They are historic artifacts."
Serious collectors view collecting as museological in nature, requiring expertise, research, classification, conservation. (The profiting and speculation are, in this framing, an amoral byproduct.) They will readily make a preservationist argument, claiming that if it weren't for their obsessive accumulation, these items would be lost or destroyed. It can get downright high-minded -- collectors will tell you they help ensure history won't be forgotten, won't be repeated. "Because 'never again,"' one dealer said when I asked why he sells badges of the Totenkopf, a style of skull-and-bones insignia used by the SS.
I don't know what's happening in anyone's heart of hearts, and I'm admittedly avoiding any lines of psychological inquiry, but from everything I've seen and from everyone I've spoken to, my sense is that, for the most part, the collectors are sincere and are not harboring any Nazi sympathies. At the same time I don't think their sincerity or sympathies are all that germane.
The very concept of "Nazi memorabilia" is a misapprehension of these artifacts, a mistreatment of a fraught material history; it relies on and feeds an insidious distortion of World War II, which is flattened into a tale of victors and vanquished. The cruelty, the suffering, the victims, the genocide are all out of frame. History, and especially history of World War II, is never just an accumulation of facts; it's a narrative, constructed with more or less deliberation but constructed all the same. Decontextualization can be -- regardless of intentions -- a form of soft revisionism.
At the Show of Shows, I experienced an initial shock at seeing all that Nazi merchandise, and an ancillary shock at seeing all those ready customers, but once that wore off -- which didn't take long, it was what was normal there -- something else disconcerting came into focus. In this huge hall so proudly dedicated to history, full of men so passionate about the past, so committed to its preservation, who pride themselves on their arcane knowledge of World War II, some of whom will unhesitatingly invoke "never again" as a justification to trade SS badges, the Holocaust was almost entirely absent. Or really any indication at all that the Nazis were guilty of anything beyond being defeated.
I realize a trade show doesn't purport to be a classroom, but even so, the Holocaust's absence is demonstrative of where the emphasis is being placed. I don't mean to accuse the organizers of any sort of malice -- in fact it's a semi-enforced etiquette to not display anything considered "hateful," like overtly antisemitic Nazi propaganda posters, and certainly no Holocaust items, which are widely considered within the community to be beyond the pale. (On my last day at the show I came across a yellow star, but was quickly informed that it was in fact unworn -- it had come from an uncut roll seized by Allied soldiers straight from the factory and so was still technically a war trophy.) This is a well-intentioned boundary, but it puts into relief the void at the center of this approach to this history.
As a historical stance it's toxic, and it seeps. Rampant in the collecting community, if to varying degrees, is something called the myth of the clean Wehrmacht, which posits that the Wehrmacht, Nazi Germany's conventional armed forces, was just a regular military, no more or less ethical than other militaries, just doing regular military stuff, and it was the SS that did all the nasty work.
This is a reprehensible take, not only because it's so spectacularly and famously inaccurate -- the theory had a strong hold in Germany until the 1980s when the country began to come to grips with its own history -- but also because at its core it's a repudiation of moral responsibility. It's whatever the opposite of "reckoning" is.
The theory's appeal to the collectors is obvious: It's a moral scrub, removing what's unappealing and difficult to market, so what remains is clean and collectible. There's a similar sort of negationist warp in many of the books and catalogs that trace and categorize the artifacts; these catalogs are written or informed largely by former Nazis, who are subtly or not-so-subtly laundering their wartime histories. Even the lot descriptions give away what, in this world, World War II is and is not about. Dr. Hughes, in his book, notes a dealer's description of Hitler's chair and desk set: "This simple piece of furniture is one of the most iconic and important items in World War II history."
Turning Nazi artifacts into tradeables, far from fulfilling some sort of preservationist mandate, in fact mutes what's historically meaningful about them. The purpose of preservation is not merely to ensure artifacts aren't lost or damaged, but to place them in proper context, to narrativize them.
Without that context, Nazi artifacts only represent a fascination with and commodification of Nazism; what's being traded and promoted is Nazi symbology. The claim that a Nazi artifact is so rigidly "historical" as to be apolitical is at best oblivious, if not dismissive, of how these symbols are deployed today, to what they mean to most people, to their very current political implications. The world in which a swastika was a dead and sterile symbol, in which it wasn't the go-to badge of increasingly visible and unashamed neo-Nazis and white supremacists -- this would be a much improved world.
The collectors and especially the platforms rely on and hide behind the "historical" as a moral criterion, that it's OK as long it's authentic. But it doesn't work like that: You can't contain a symbol's meaning and power and reach. Individuals, maybe, can hold steady the line between fascination and fetishization, between obsession and glorification, but collectively it's impossible.
The depoliticization of the swastika, even or especially in the name of "history," has potent effects that go beyond the world of collectors. It sanitizes the symbol, makes it that much less charged, that much more mainstream, and in turn helps legitimate those who rally around it. There's no non-hateful version of a Nazi symbol, in other words. The insistence that just because it's historical it's innocent is misguided. Sure, this particular artifact may be a piece of history, but what it espouses is very much not behind us.
The more time I spent in the world of Nazi memorabilia collection, the more I spoke with collectors and scholars and the platforms, the more clear it became to me that, ideally, the artifacts should be in public custodianship. Contrary to many collectors' protestations, essentially no one is calling for the destruction of history. Public and public-facing institutions such as museums and archives can preserve and make accessible even the ghastliest material history, and can do so responsibly, treating artifacts not as collectibles or relics but as elements of a story. Public custodianship also functions as a kind of spiritual safekeeping, upholding the historical value while suppressing monetary or sentimental or even mystical value. The United States government has in protected storage an enormous collection of Nazi art and artifacts, including a few paintings by Hitler. It doesn't know what to do with any of these items, so it simply holds on to them, which is exactly right.
Tellingly, with respect to the material history of World War II, the (responsible) museum is basically the inverse of the collector. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum does not accept weaponry -- the bread and butter of the Nazi memorabilia market -- because Nazi weaponry does not illuminate the story the museum is dedicated to telling. But the Holocaust-related items -- which to the (responsible) collector are beyond the pale, which are considered un-collectible (and are often unsellable) -- are what the museum is built on, because these items bear witness to the consequences of Nazi ideology.
I recognize that this is an ideal, not a solution. There's no enforcement mechanism to ensure that these artifacts end up in the hands of museums and historical organizations; the First Amendment seems to forestall regulation of the sale or possession of Nazi artifacts. (That said, there are some instances in which a moral code regarding the possession and trade of an object is legally enforced -- certain antiquities and Native American cultural artifacts, for instance, and, interestingly, Medals of Honor, which by law cannot be bought or sold.)
But I don't believe that means there's nothing to be done; it only means our response isn't legislative. If the goal is to counter the normalizing and sanitizing of Nazi symbols, then the market corrective, as it were, is to stigmatize -- to articulate and defend moral boundaries, to assert and reassert what's tolerated and what's beyond the pale.
Outrage can be effective, but it has to be harnessed and it has to be directed. Otherwise the debate never gets past whether or not some guy is a crypto-Nazi or whether some item is sufficiently "historical," and that gives cover to the market participants, allowing them to frame it as an issue of censorship or First Amendment rights. It all just crumbles along the usual battle lines.
However upset you personally are by Nazi memorabilia, the fact is that the corporations that traffic in them, most prominently LiveAuctioneers, do not face sustained blowback, because otherwise they'd stop. Their policies reflect what they believe they can get away with, both in the court of law and of public opinion.
LiveAuctioneers considered but ultimately turned down my request for an interview; instead it directed me to a "statement on vintage items with hateful imagery," by the company's former chief executive, Phil Michaelson. (The page has since been taken down.) Mr. Michaelson opens with an anecdote about how his rabbi used an SS hat to inspire his Yom Kippur sermon, then warns that "censorship is a very slippery slope" and laments that it is "hard to determine what may or may not be considered" as "an object worth retaining for posterity." He worries that "eliminating history" can "make us more likely to repeat past atrocities."
An instructive counterexample is eBay, which over the last two decades has learned (or been forced to learn, depending how you want to see it) what the public is willing to stand for, what the company stands for.
"When I started with eBay it was a different world," Wolfgang Weber, the company's associate general counsel, told me. "In the U.S., there was no concern at all that democracy could be at risk. Instead, there was a view that freedom of speech is a constitutional right."
But eBay's policy evolved. Eventually the company, after several controversies, and after consulting with historians and Holocaust survivors, "landed on the decision to ban these items," Mr. Weber said. "It's important that these items are preserved but we found in the end that eBay is not the right place for this. These items belong in a museum."
At the Show of Shows I watched a teenage boy, maybe 15 or 16 years old, browse a table of Nazi daggers. There was one he really liked, but it was expensive; he told the seller he wasn't sure he could afford it. The seller nodded and pulled out a similar-looking dagger, which was half the price.
The boy was suspicious. "What's wrong with it?" he asked. "Nothing," the seller said. "There's nothing wrong with any of them."
Methodology
To report this story, Times Opinion compiled a data set of LiveAuctioneers listings for Nazi memorabilia. The data set includes unique listings that appeared in the search results for the following terms: "Adolf Hitler," "Nazi swastika," "Nazi Heer," "Nazi Kriegsmarine," "Nazi Luftwaffe," "Nazi SS," "Schutzstaffel," "Third Reich" and "Wehrmacht." Listings categorized as books or that included the word "book," "hardcover" or "paperback" in their title were removed from the data set. All listings were from auction houses located in the United States.
The auction items shown throughout the story were pulled from actual LiveAuctioneers listings, which have been edited for clarity. Times Opinion has not authenticated the listings.

Full text: J.D. Vance was trying to find his groove. I had just shown up at his office last week to interview the Ohio Republican about his first nine months in the Senate, where he has proved curiously hard to pigeonhole. As we sat down, Mr. Vance -- at 39, one of the chamber's youngest members -- squirmed in his ornate leather arm chair, complaining that it was uncomfortable. Whoever used it previously, he explained, had created a "giant ass print" that made it a poor fit for him.
Then the senator kicked a foot up on the low coffee table in front of him. This gave me a glorious view of his custom socks: a dark-red background covered with pictures of his 6-year-old son's face. On the far end of the table was a Lego set of the U.S. Capitol that his wife had bought him on eBay for Father's Day. With his crisp dark suit, casual manner and personal touches, Mr. Vance suddenly looked right at home. I suspected there was some grand metaphor in all this about the young conservative working to carve out his spot in this world of old leather and hidebound traditions.
I asked what had been his most pleasant discovery about life in the Senate. "I've been surprised by how little people hate each other in private," he offered, positing that much of the acrimony you see from lawmakers was "posturing" for TV. "There's sort of an inherent falseness to the way that people present on American media," he said.
This may strike many people as rich coming from Mr. Vance, who is one of the Republican Party's new breed of in-your-face, culture-warring, Trump-defending MAGA agitators. And indeed, Mr. Vance knows how to throw a partisan punch. Yet in these early days on the job, he has also adopted a somewhat more complicated political model, frequently championing legislation with Democrats, including progressives such as Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Baldwin.
Pragmatic bipartisan MAGA troll feels like a dizzyingly paradoxical line to toe. And it risks feeding into the larger critique of Mr. Vance as a political opportunist. This is, after all, the guy who won attention in the 2016 election cycle as a harsh conservative critic of Mr. Trump, only to undergo a stark MAGA makeover and spend much of his 2022 Senate race sucking up to the former president. "I don't know that I can disrespect someone more than J.D. Vance," Mitt Romney, the Utah senator and former Republican presidential nominee, told his biographer about the party's 2022 midterm contenders. "It's like, really? You sell yourself so cheap?"
Mr. Vance is not someone who would ignore such swipes. "Mitt Romney is one to talk about changing his mind publicly. He's been on every side of 35 different issues," he clapped back to Breitbart News.
But there seems to be something going on with Mr. Vance beyond the usual shape-shifting flip-floppery. He contends that his approach is the more honest, hopeful path to getting things done for the conservative grass roots. In his telling, he's not the cynical operator; his critics are.
In some respects -- especially with his defense of Mr. Trump -- the freshman senator is transparently full of bull. But when it comes to how to navigate and possibly even make progress in today's fractious G.O.P., not to mention this dysfunctional Congress, he may well be onto something.
Mr. Vance and I sat down on a morning when Congress was all in a dither over a possible government shutdown being driven by a spending fight among House Republicans. While sympathetic to his colleagues' concerns, Mr. Vance sees the battle as unfocused, unproductive and bad for the party.
"My sense is this shutdown fight will go very poorly for us unless we're very clear about what we're asking for," he told me. With different blocs of Republicans demanding different things, "that's just going to get confused, and the American people are going to punish us for it."
He argued that if the conservatives would hunker down and focus, they could get one major concession. "And we should be fighting for that one thing," he said. What did he think they should prioritize? "If we could get something real on border security, then that would be a deal worth taking."
Mr. Vance described himself as less an ideological revolutionary than a principled pragmatist. He did not go to Washington to blow up the system or overhaul how theSenate operates. He said his outlook was, "There are things I need to get done, and I will do whatever I need to do to do them."
If this means making common cause with the political enemy now and again, so be it. "I am a populist in a lot of my economic convictions, and so that will lead to opportunities to work with Democrats," he reasoned.
Mr. Vance's cross-aisle endeavors include teaming up with Ms. Warren to push legislation that would claw back compensation from bank executives who were richly paid even as they were "crashing their banks into a mountain," as Mr. Vance put it. He has joined forces with Ms. Baldwin on a bill that would ensure that technologies developed with taxpayer money are manufactured in the United States. He is working with Senators Amy Klobuchar and Ron Wyden on a bill to reduce thefts of catalytic converters. And in the coming weeks, his focus will be on pushing through railway safety reform that he and Ohio's senior senator, Sherrod Brown, introduced in the wake of the derailment disaster in East Palestine. That is the bill about which he was most optimistic. "We have 60 votes in private," he said.
Even if nothing makes it through this year, Mr. Vance is playing the long game. "Those productive personal relationships are quite valuable because they may not lead to an actual legislative package tomorrow, but they could two years from now," he said.
Squishy "relationship" talk can be dangerous in today's G.O.P., even for members of the relatively genteel Senate. Being labeled a RINO -- that is, a Republican in Name Only -- generally earns one the sort of opprobrium normally reserved for child sex traffickers.
But here's where his MAGA antics may provide a bit of cover. In his brief time in Washington, the senator has proved himself an eager and a prolific culture warrior. The first bill he introduced -- an important moment in any senator's career -- aimed to make English the nation's official language. In July, after the Supreme Court ruled against affirmative action in university admissions, he fired off a letter to the eight Ivy League schools, plus a couple of private colleges in Ohio, warning them to retain any records that might be needed for a Senate investigation of their practices. That same month, he introduced a bill to ban gender-affirming care for minors. He even waded into the hysteria last winter over the health risks of gas stoves. This month, he's out hawking a bill that would ban federal mask mandates for domestic air travel, public transit systems and schools, and bar those institutions from denying service to the maskless.
Perhaps most vitally, Mr. Vance remains steadfast in his support of Mr. Trump. In June, he announced he was putting a hold on all Justice Department nominees in protest of "the unprecedented political prosecution" of Mr. Trump. And he plans to work hard as a surrogate to return the MAGA king to the White House. "I'm thinking about trying to be as active a participant as possible."
His critique of Mr. Trump's critics can be brutal.
"Trump is extraordinarily clarifying on the right and extra confusing on the left," he said. The hatred for Trump among progressives is so strong that people cannot see past it to acknowledge the former president's "good parts," he contended. While among conservatives, "Trump has this incredible capacity to identify really, who the good people are on the right and who the bad people are on the right."
Elaborating on the "bad" category, he points to former Representative Liz Cheney and the neoconservative writer Bill Kristol. "They say, 'Donald Trump is an authoritarian' -- which I think is absurd. 'Donald Trump is anti-democratic' -- which, again, in my view is absurd. I think they're hiding their real ideological disagreements," he argued.
Mr. Vance is entitled to his view, of course. But glibly rejecting stated concerns about Mr. Trump's anti-democratic inclinations -- and characterizing his critics' reactions as "obsessive" -- would strike many as the real absurdity.
Asked specifically about Mr. Trump's election fraud lies, which Mr. Vance has at times promoted, the senator again shifted into slippery explainer mode. "I think it's very easy for folks in the press to latch onto the zaniest election fraud or stolen election theories and say, 'Oh this is totally debunked,"' he said. "But they ignore that there is this very clear set of institutional biases built into the election in 2020 that -- from big tech censorship to the way in which financial interests really lined up behind Joe Biden."
"People aren't stupid. They see what's out there," he said. "Most Republican grass roots voters are not sympathetic to the dumbest version of the election conspiracy. They are sympathetic to the version that is actually largely true."
Except that, as evidence of what is "actually largely true," Mr. Vance pointed to a 2021 Time article detailing a bipartisan effort not to advance a particular candidate but to safeguard the electoral system. More important, the "dumbest" version of the stolen election conspiracy is precisely what Mr. Trump and his enablers have been aggressively spreading for years. It is what drove the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, landed many rioters in prison, led to Fox News paying a $ 787.5 million defamation settlement and prompted grand juries to indict Mr. Trump in federal and state courts. Mr. Vance may want to believe that most Republicans are too smart to buy such lunacy, but he is too smart not to recognize the damage to American democracy being wrought by that lunacy.
As for those who criticize his approach, Mr. Vance saw them as out of sync with voters. The conservative grass roots are "extremely frustrated with Washington not doing anything," he said. "I think if you are a critic of them -- if you are a critic of the way they see the world -- you see people who want to blow up the system. Who are just pissed off. And they want fighters." And not necessarily fighters who are "directed" or strategic in their efforts, he said, so much as just anyone who channels that rage.
By contrast, "if you're sympathetic to them and you like them," he continued, you understand that "the problem is not that people don't bitch enough or complain enough on television." Rather, it's that voters are fed up that "nothing changes" even when they "elect successive waves of different people. So I actually think being a bridge builder and getting things done is totally consistent with this idea that people are pissed off at the government as do-nothing."
When I asked how Mr. Vance defined his political positioning, he abruptly popped out of his chair and hurried over to his desk. He returned with a yellow sticky note on which he drew a large grid. Along the bottom of the paper he scrawled "culture" and on the left side, "commerce." He started drawing dots as he explained: "I think the Republican Party has tended to be here" -- top right quadrant, indicating a mix of strong cultural and pro-business conservatism. He added, "I think the Democratic Party has tended to be here," pointing to the bottom left quadrant, which in his telling represents a strong liberal take on both. "And I think the majority, certainly the plurality of American voters -- and maybe I'm biased because this is my actual view -- is somewhere around here," he said, placing them on the grid to suggest that people are "more conservative on cultural issues but they are not instinctively pro-business."
Mr. Vance reminded me that he has always been critical of his party's pro-business bias. And it is primarily in this space that he is playing nice with Democrats.
Bridge builder. Deal maker. MAGA maniac. Trump apologist. Call Mr. Vance whatever you want. And if you find it all confused or confusing, don't fret. That may be part of the point. Mr. Trump's Republican Party is something of a chaotic mess. Until it figures out where it is headed, a shape-shifting MAGA brawler who quietly works across the aisle on particular issues may be the best this party has to offer.

Justice Dept. Targets eBay Over Unlawful Sales
The Justice Department filed a civil complaint against eBay, claiming the online marketplace unlawfully sold and distributed hundreds of thousands of products like pesticides and motor vehicle emission-evading devices that violate environmental laws.
The complaint Wednesday claims eBay sold, offered for sale or caused the sale of more than 343,000 aftermarket devices that try to evade motor vehicle emissions controls.
It also alleges the company unlawfully distributed or sold at least 23,000 pesticides that were unregistered, misbranded or for restricted use.
In addition, the complaint claims eBay distributed more than 5,600 painting and coating removal products that include methylene chloride.
eBay called the government's actions "entirely unprecedented," and said that it planned to vigorously defend itself.

AUTOMOBILES
Hyundai and Kia Recall 3.4 Million Vehicles
Hyundai and Kia are recalling nearly 3.4 million vehicles in the U.S. and telling owners to park them outside and away from structures because of the risk of engine compartment fires.
The recalls cover multiple car and S.U.V. models from the 2010 through 2019 model years including Hyundai's Santa Fe SUV and Kia's Sorrento SUV.
Documents posted Wednesday by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration say the anti-lock brake control module can leak fluid and cause an electrical short, which can touch off a fire while the vehicles are parked or being driven.
Dealers will replace the anti-lock brake fuse at no cost.
Hyundai reported 21 fires in the affected vehicles in the U.S., and another 22 "thermal incidents" including smoke, burning and melting of parts, the documents say. Kia reported 10 fires and melting incidents. ASSOCIATED PRESS
ECONOMY
Orders for Durable Goods Exceeded Expectations
Orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose in August as an increase in machinery and other products offset a drop in civilian aircraft, and business spending on equipment appeared to regain momentum after faltering early in the third quarter.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday also showed shipments of capital goods rebounding sharply last month, a sign of resilience in both business investment and the overall economy despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy tightening. The surge in shipments compensated for downward revisions to July's data.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, gained 0.2 percent last month. Data for July was revised lower to show orders for these goods decreasing 5.6 percent instead of 5.2 percent, as previously reported. REUTERS

Full text: You've Got (Scam) Mail
A few months ago, I received an email that, at first glance, looked like dozens of others that arrived in my inbox this year. I'm a professional illustrator, and this person was writing with what appeared to be a job offer.
Some things felt slightly off, but I wrote back.
The response was surprising: The person knew some things about hiring an illustrator, using industry terminology and making other requests typical of art directors.
We exchanged several more emails. I asked some questions and negotiated a higher rate. At this point, I was almost certain it was a scam.
And then the most glaring red flag: The person wanted to pay me immediately. As a freelancer, I almost always collect payment once a project is completed. Sometimes it takes months.
Out of curiosity, I decided to play along and agreed to take the job.
Scams have been around forever, but in 2022, consumers reported losing almost $ 8.8 billion to fraud, a 30 percent jump from the year before, according to data released by the Federal Trade Commission.
The actual number is probably much higher. John Breyault, a fraud expert at the National Consumers League, said that fraud tended to be underreported.
The pandemic also created a perfect storm for scams.
My experience made me think that other people were being scammed too, but just didn't talk about it.
So I decided to find out firsthand: I put out a call on Instagram and was almost instantly flooded with peoples' stories of being swindled through LinkedIn when applying for a job, on eBay when buying things, on Craigslist when looking for an apartment. Often, the targets were in vulnerable positions: desperate for work or housing, or experiencing momentous life changes.
Talking to others about their experiences sent me down an internet rabbit hole about scammers, and I discovered an entire subculture devoted to baiting them.
I began obsessively watching YouTube videos of people trying to "scam the scammers," like the account of a software engineer from Northern Ireland who uses the pseudonym Jim Browning to protect his privacy. On his channel, which has over four million subscribers, he creates content to educate people about common tactics of scammers and how to catch them in the act.
"I go to extremes," he said about the tactics he uses to turn the tables on con artists. "If they're using computers, do they have a webcam or CCTV? Can I see the guy that's trying to scam me? I've changed the robocall messages that they've sent out. I've made videos where I've sent harmless devices into scam call centers. I teamed up with Mark Rober -- an ex-NASA engineer -- and we managed to send things that released cockroaches and mice. That was an attempt to poke a bit of fun at the scammers."
The mechanics of scamming are as old as time, but technology has made it more sophisticated. "There will always be scammers, there always have been," the software engineer from Northern Ireland said. "The only thing that's changed is the technology that they use."
Mr. Breyault, the fraud expert, agreed.
He also said that generative A.I. could be used by scammers to make their ruses more sophisticated.
Eventually I let my scammer know that I knew what was really going on. What I got back was a confession:
Was this person really in dire straits? I'll never know. But at that point the only thing to do was walk away.

My Mother's Prayer Book Returns: [Style Desk]

Full text: A precious object finds its way home.
It started with an email. The subject line: "Sylvia Kanner's Siddur." Kanner was my late mother's maiden name. Siddur is the Hebrew word for prayer book. I was, to say the least, intrigued.
The sender explained that she had purchased several Judaic items on eBay. One was a small, leather-bound prayer book. On the inner flap she found the name Sylvia Kanner, written in pencil. Curious, she searched Ancestry.com and discovered my mother's obituary, identifying me among her survivors.
She kept digging. With more online digging, she found my profile and email link on the website for Rutgers University, where I am a part-time instructor.
In the email she stated her intention: "I would like to return all of the items to you and your family."
The email included a photo of the page with my mother's name. The careful script was unmistakably my mother's hand. The address under the signature was familiar, too: 169 Hewes St., Brooklyn, N.Y.
I did some searching of my own and confirmed that the sender was legit. In an exchange of emails, we established that she lives in Highland Park, just across the Raritan River from the Rutgers campus in New Brunswick.
I suggested a meeting near her home; she did me one better. Her neighbor happened to be the assistant to the dean at the School of Communication and Information, where I teach. And so, the next Tuesday morning, I walked up two flights from my ground-floor journalism lab and was handed my mother's siddur.
It was like touching a holy grail. Yet it seemed out of character with everything I thought I knew about my mother.
I grew up in Queens, in a decidedly secular family. Our neighborhood was largely Jewish, but we didn't belong to the nearby shul. My parents had affixed a mezuza to our front door jamb, but we didn't light Sabbath candles, nor did we fast on Yom Kippur. Other holidays were special, but only because my mother would fill the table with traditional food.
Unlike most of my boyhood friends, I did not attend Hebrew school. At 12, to pacify my father's father -- my last surviving grandparent -- I took a cram course for my bar mitzvah from a rabbi in Bayside who tutored unaffiliated boys like me in his basement.
As far as I knew, my mother's upbringing was similarly lacking in religious fervor. While my grandmother was renowned for her homemade gefilte fish, my maternal grandparents were not, to my knowledge, particularly observant.
For my mother, Jewishness was more a matter of pride than practice. She made sure my older sister and I shared her sentimentality. Watching old movies on TV we were informed whenever a Jewish actor appeared. Edward G. Robinson? Real name Emanuel Goldenberg. John Garfield? Jacob Garfinkle. Lauren Bacall? Betty Joan Perske. Dinah Shore? Also, a Yiddishe meydele. (My mother's brothers even made up Jewish names for our baseball heroes. Mickey Mantle became Mickey Mendel.)
But that did not explain my mother's siddur. Never had I seen her read Hebrew, much less recite a prayer.
That morning in New Brunswick, the siddur was turned over to me inside a wine-red Tallis bag. Nestled alongside it were a threadbare Tallis, two nondescript yarmulkes (one black, one white) and a single piece of tefillin, the small box with leather straps that orthodox men wrap on their arms and head during prayer. (The Tallis bag only contained the arm piece.) None of the items provided any identifying marks, other than my mother's siddur.
I was overjoyed, but mystified. How had these sacred items worked their way through eBay to this woman's hands? When did my mother own this siddur? Where had it been all these decades? And were the other items from my family, too?
The initial clues appeared on the prayer book's inside flap. First, I investigated the address. From conversations I had had with my mother, I knew her family had moved to Hewes Street around 1922, when she was 5 years old. From the 1930 census, I learned the family had relocated to a new Brooklyn address on Lafayette Avenue.
I could now surmise that my mother was given the book at some point before 1930, when she was perhaps 10 or 12. Below her address, she had written a poem:
I pity the river
I pity the brook
I pity the one
That steals this book!
Most likely this was something my mother had seen in an autograph book upon graduating elementary school. It was hardly original; it was certainly the work of a child.
The book itself is a treasure. Measuring about 5-inches tall by 3-inches wide, its leather binding is embossed with an elegant geometric border. On the front cover and spine are the words "Daily Prayers." Inside, the title page reads, "The Form of Daily Prayers According to te [sic] custom of the German and Polish Jews." Each page in Hebrew faces a page in English translation. Published in Vienna in 1857 by Jos. Schlesinger Library, it was probably created for the American market.
Another possible clue: One of the siddur's 675 gilt-edged pages is dog-eared at "The Memorial of Departed Souls."
Eager to learn more, I went back to the eBay listing and messaged the seller. She replied within minutes with a significant clue. The seller had acquired the Tallis bag and its contents at an estate sale at "the Kanner home in Garden City."
Another bolt from the blue! This was the home of my mother's older brother, Dr. George Kanner, and his family. Rather than travel some circuitous route through multiple owners before landing on eBay, the prayer book had been in my family all along, in a house where I had spent many childhood sleepovers with my cousin David.
I contacted David immediately. After the death of his parents, he and his sister were overwhelmed by the task of cleaning out the family home. They sold the house with all its contents to a new owner who subsequently held the estate sale.
Now I had proof that all of the items could be traced back to my family. That made sense -- except for the tefillin. Could it have been used by my mother's father or any of her three brothers? It didn't seem likely.
Then I remembered the photos of my maternal great-grandfather, Benjamin Sass, a pious-looking old soul with sad eyes and a biblical beard. I knew that Benjamin's wife, my great-grandmother Rebecca (known as Becky), died in 1932. Perhaps they were the ones who gave the little prayer book to my mother.
A picture began to form. I can see my little-girl mom, walking hand-in-hand to shul with her bearded grandfather. He is carrying my mother's siddur in his Tallis bag. Finding a seat in the shul, he dons his holy accouterments and together they chant the memorial prayers for the departed Becky.
Now, 90 years later, my mother's siddur has come home, a long-forgotten relic restored to loving hands. Somewhere, Sylvia is kvelling.

Full text: The auction house is offering an eclectic collection from Pier 24 Photography, including anonymous snapshots of Lucky Luciano and 1880s baseball players.
Pier 24 Photography made its debut in 2010 on the San Francisco waterfront, the creation of a former investment banker, Andrew Pilara. Since then, the exhibition space has staged highly regarded photography shows, mostly drawn from the founder's wide-ranging collection.
But early this year, unhappy that the San Francisco Port Commission had tripled the rent, Pilara, 81, announced that Pier 24 will close in July 2025. While he will give the majority of its holdings to museums, a sizable portion will be sold to support medical research, education and the arts, through a foundation that he and his wife, Mary Pilara, oversee.
Although the collection is known for its in-depth representation of prominent artists, a significant part of Pilara's collection was created by anonymous photographers. Sotheby's will offer up many of these images that Christopher McCall, the Pier 24 director, culled from eBay, flea markets and auctions in the organization's first sale of vernacular photography, online from Sept. 26 to Oct. 3.
The photographers' aim were functional, not artistic. About a third of the lots comprise police mug shots, a genre that Pilara embraced early. "When I saw mug shots, I said, they are sitting for a portrait," he recalled in a video interview. And, because they sparked an emotional response, they met his essential criterion of whether to buy.
"About Face," an exhibition of portraits at Pier 24 in 2012-13, presented a roomful of more than 300 mug shots, as well as photographs by renowned artists, including August Sander, Richard Avedon and Cindy Sherman. "It was very popular," Pilara said of the mug shot room. While most of the pictures were arrayed in multiples, along the lines of the typological arrangements of Bernd and Hilla Becher (also represented in the Pier 24 collection), the celebrity mobster Charles "Lucky" Luciano merited a framed diptych of his own. (It is included in the auction.)
The Sotheby's sale also features shots of new prisoners at San Quentin in 1935 and grisly crime-scene photos in New York in the 1930s. But much of the selection is more wholesome. Pilara, a longtime baseball fan, acquired an archive of 364 retouched portraits of ballplayers that The Chicago Tribune relinquished as it entered the digital age. ("I was a pitcher," Pilara said. "Baseball has been my life, and I'd never seen press photos like that.") Aesthetically more impressive are a collodion print on iron (a kind of tintype) of "Tug" Arundel, a catcher who played for the Indianapolis Hoosiers in the 1880s, and a cyanotype of a pitcher's arm and hand gripping a baseball.
Also memorable are an assemblage of hand-colored, black-and-white portraits from northeastern Brazil and 40 American tintypes, mostly of children, many embellished with a paintbrush. In one memento, a delicately painted lace bib poignantly evokes the fragility of a baby. But who were the people behind the camera? An undated self-portrait of a practitioner, his camera on a tripod, provides a likeness if not a name.
Pilara particularly sought out scrapbooks with an insight into people's lives. A photo album kept in the early 20th century by a young woman, Mildred Elizabeth Wheatley, documents her progression from infancy to marriage.
More unexpected is a large collection of photo identification badges, worn by workers entering factories in the 1940s. On the surface, nothing could be less emotionally moving, yet for Pilara, they resonate. "My wife of 40 years is from a small town of 900 in Illinois," he explained. She would tell him about the manufacturing plants in her birthplace, and the jobs they provided, that had been lost to other countries, especially China. "I'm an investor," he said. "That really put it on the wall for me."
He has amassed pictures of the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906 for similar reasons: He was born and raised in the city. A grouping of 20 snapshots of the catastrophe included in the auction were likely taken by an amateur wandering through the city with one of the inexpensive Kodak cameras that were all the rage at the turn of the century.
Glenstone Museum in Maryland (endowed by Emily and Mitchell Rales) purchased 112 photographs from the Pier 24 collection in March, zeroing in on big names like Diane Arbus, Walker Evans, William Eggleston and Rineke Dijkstra. A sale in May at Sotheby's also focused on well-known artists, including Dorothea Lange and Robert Adams, and netted close to $ 11 million.
But more vernacular and less pricey images cast a light on one of photography's primary purposes -- documentation. They are represented here in its myriad forms: supervision, publicity, remembrance. Whether artistically distinguished or not, the pictures remind you of the passage of time and the inevitability of extinction. They make you think, mourn and dream.

Museums Should Never Have Hoarded Looted Artifacts: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The news that roughly 2,000 objects, dating from antiquity to the 19th century, have disappeared over a decade from the vast storerooms of the British Museum -- a fact the museum acknowledged a few weeks ago -- should be enough to endanger the job security of any museum's director. Add in the news that the thief is suspected to have been a curator of Greek antiquities at the museum, and that the precious objects were being peddled in the digital marketplace, and you can understand why the museum's director recently resigned.
These revelations have shaken the staid museum world and raised important questions about security, record keeping and funding priorities. But the root problem goes deeper, to the origins of our national museums. And the fix will take more than new security protocols.
The British Museum must use this scandal as an opportunity to update the dusty notion of the so-called universal museum -- rethinking how these institutions can exist in a 21st-century world where the sharing and blending of cultures has never been more crucial. Rather than resisting calls to repatriate contested objects in their collections, museums should be transparent about their holdings and how they were acquired. They should embark on a campaign of generous, long-term loans that allows objects to circulate freely across borders. And they should embrace digital tools to open their storage facilities to public scrutiny.
This is an opportunity to radically reimagine the mission and purpose of the universal museum -- places like the Metropolitan Museum, the Louvre, the Prado and the British Museum -- and what they owe to the world.
The dream of a "universal" or "encyclopedic" museum was born centuries ago as a product of the Enlightenment. During the 1700s, in a burst of noblesse oblige, many art collections were moved from private drawing rooms into public spaces, where they theoretically could be appreciated by all. The grand institutions that were built over the next century to house them were established on the notion that access to the world's art and artifacts would foster an enlightened, democratic culture -- and, implicitly or explicitly, on the idea that only institutions in the West could properly preserve, protect and study the world's great wonders.
The Enlightenment led into the age of empire, and these new museums were quickly filled with plunder. Thomas Bruce (a.k.a. Lord Elgin) whisked sculptures from the Parthenon away to London. "The Winged Victory of Samothrace" landed in the Louvre. The "Benin Bronzes" were dispersed around the globe, including to the Met. Egypt's Nefertiti bust was shipped off to Berlin.
At the time, many considered this kind of acquisition to be benign, even necessary, arguing that the museums would be suitable curators and custodians of the objects. That view is still invoked as the rationale to keep vast collections of antiquities in museum storerooms now. In 2002, more than a dozen leading museums, including the Louvre and the Met, signed on to a "Declaration on the Importance and Value of Universal Museums," partly as a retort to Greece's nagging claims for a return of the Parthenon marbles in London and to the growing criticism that these museums embodied a colonial view of culture that needed correcting.
"Over time, objects so acquired -- whether by purchase, gift or partage -- have become part of the museums that have cared for them, and by extension part of the heritage of the nations which house them," the statement read. "To narrow the focus of museums whose collections are diverse and multifaceted would therefore be a disservice to all visitors."
But the theft of objects from the bowels of the British Museum put the lie to that threadbare view: If these institutions fail at the fundamental task of physically protecting the treasures they are supposedly preserving, how can they justify keeping things they themselves have taken from other societies?
Indeed, the British Museum thefts might have gone unnoticed if not for an antiquities dealer who was browsing eBay and recognized an ancient Roman cameo as one from the museum's collection. The dealer notified the museum in 2021 that, after tracking and buying many such objects, he had identified the anonymous seller via a PayPal account. The evidence presented by the dealer was doubly disturbing: Not only were the thefts an inside job, but they were allegedly carried out by a curator (who is now facing a police investigation) whose duty was to protect these objects.
As an investigative reporter, I spent years uncovering how the J. Paul Getty Museum, along with peer institutions in Boston, New York and elsewhere, had built world-class collections of Classical antiquities in the 1980s and '90s by doing business with a thriving black market. After the Getty's curator was criminally charged by the Italian government (a case that was later dropped when a three-judge panel ruled that the statute of limitations had expired), the mounting evidence compelled several museums to return over 100 looted antiquities to Italy, Greece, Turkey and beyond.
Several antiquities dealers have likewise been heavily involved in the theft and sale of antiquities from across Asia, selling them to collectors and museums, including some in the United States. Some of the dealers have since faced criminal charges, and federal agents at Homeland Security Investigations, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency usually charged with investigating antiquities trafficking, have worked with federal and state prosecutors to seize and repatriate tens of thousands of looted objects.
European museums are facing a similar reckoning about their colonial acquisitions. A report commissioned by France's president recommended the restitution of major artifacts and any illegally obtained works to African countries on the basis of bilateral agreements. Last year, Germany announced it would return more than 1,000 bronzes from the historical Kingdom of Benin.
As the very first of the universal museums, the British Museum built its collection over several hundred years of colonial boondoggles and the result is a treasure house of epic proportions: The collection contains some eight million objects (nobody knows for sure), of which only about 4.5 million have been fully documented online. A mere 1 percent are on display. But the museum is largely prohibited by law from disposing of its holdings, and it has often justified its position by invoking its ability to safeguard the world's treasures.
That position no longer makes sense. The universal museum, a relic of the Enlightenment, was never truly universal: Virtually all universal museums reside in Western cities, far beyond the reach of many of the communities from which their objects were taken. And there is nothing enlightened about hoarding the world's culture in storage, unseen by many and often, apparently, unsafe.

Faking the Past Until a Camera Sees It as Real: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: The people who designed the look of "The Buccaneers," "The Gilded Age," "Lessons in Chemistry" and "The Continental" discuss the importance of gilding, sledgehammers and eBay.
"I always say that if there were a marble Olympics, our team would definitely take the gold," Bob Shaw bragged.
Shaw, the Emmy-winning production designer of the HBO drama "The Gilded Age," was discussing the painstaking effort and maddening attention to detail that goes into painting a wooden column so that the camera can't help but read it as stone. The scenic artists of "The Gilded Age" can paint a half-dozen distinct marble varieties. To pause at nearly any frame of the show is to marvel at the meticulous mix of authentic materials and brilliant fakes. Look closely at the candelabras, for example: They are fitted with fire-safe LEDs hooked to wavering filaments that substitute for open flame.
Though production design is often seen as a mere backdrop to the action, the scenery, furnishings, finishes and props have their own stories to tell. And these stories are often especially intricate in period dramas, in which a need for accuracy must accommodate narrative demands and the constraints of a show's budget.
The New York Times spoke to the production designers of four shows that collectively span a century this fall: Amy Maguire of "The Buccaneers," set in the 1870s; Shaw of "The Gilded Age," set in the 1880s; Cat Smith of "Lessons in Chemistry," set in the 1950s; and Drew Boughton of "The Continental: From the World of John Wick," set in the 1970s. Focusing on one exemplary set each, from a castle's reception rooms to a dream garden to a kitchen nightmare to a hotel lobby, the designers discussed the challenges and rewards of stepping back in time with high-definition cameras watching.
Hemmed in by history
Based on Edith Wharton's posthumously published novel "The Buccaneers," premiering on Apple TV+ on Nov. 8, follows five nouveau riche American girls who travel to England in search of titled husbands. In designing the show, which was shot in Scotland, Maguire had to highlight the contrast between the exuberant, flashy interiors of the girls' New York homes and the more staid spaces inhabited and inherited by the English aristocracy.
The most significant of these is Tintagel Castle, the home of Theo, Duke of Tintagel (Guy Remmers), the show's most eligible bachelor. A real Tintagel Castle exists, but it is inconveniently a ruin; the filmed one needed to have rather more solidity. "That feeling of ancestral weight and inherited status," Maguire said.
So she and the locations team found a substitute in Drumlanrig Castle, in Dumfriesshire. Exteriors were borrowed from other places, chiefly Culzean Castle, which is situated on cliffs above the sea, lending the place a feeling of the sublime.
For the castle's interiors, Maguire chose rich, deep tones for the upholstery and silk paneling, often coordinating them with Drumlanrig's real art collection. "The private art collections in these buildings are just obscene," she said. "So it really felt like you were surrounded, almost hemmed in, by the history." That worked for the story, showing how out of place these boisterous heiresses feel in these weighty, formal spaces.
The rooms built in the studio near Edinburgh had to match the real ones, mirroring every wood grain type, every shade of gilded paint. Maguire joked that the production used every stick of antique furniture in London's prop houses.
For the American spaces, Maguire used other historic homes, including Manderston House and Gosford House, as well as some of Glasgow's cityscape. These spaces were designed to be lighter, more modern, more femme. Wharton's girls have all the money in the world, and these spaces had to show it, in marble and silver and extravagant floral display. The bright colors and clashing patterns are meant to a suggest what a teenage girl with no limit to her budget or imagination might choose.
"It's kind of toeing the line between gaudy and just enough taste," Maguire said.
A slightly less gilded age
Flowers were not enough.
In the first season of "The Gilded Age," the home of Bertha Russell (Carrie Coon), the wife of a railroad magnate (Morgan Spector), was garlanded with fields of flowers for each social event. So even though the script for the first episode of Season 2, which premieres on HBO on Oct. 29, described the Russell home as resplendent with flowers, Shaw knew he had to do more.
In a scene at the close of the episode, Bertha, a patron of the nascent Metropolitan Opera, arranges a surprise performance of a song from Gounod's "Faust" by the Swedish soprano Christine Nilsson. While her guests are dining, her sumptuous staircase is transformed into Marguerite's garden. There are flowers, yes, a mix of real and artificial ones, garlanding the railings. But above the staircase are several panels of hand-painted Italian scenery, as would have been seen in the opera houses of the day.
"It was a challenge to have it be beautiful and evocative and tasteful and not be cute," Shaw said. "It conveys that Bertha goes to extremes beyond what anyone could imagine to get what she wants."
The result is ostentatious but still gorgeous. This is a line that Shaw and his team often walk, on lush carpeting. "The Gilded Age" dramatizes the conflict between new money, like the Russells, and old money, like their near neighbors, Agnes van Rhijn (Christine Baranski) and Ada Brook (Cynthia Nixon). The excesses of the new money crowd gave the Gilded Age its name, but whether in the studio or filming on location in various historic homes, Shaw balances lavishness with restraint.
"In all of the houses that we did, we had to back off a little bit from the 100 percent period look," Shaw said. "Because it's too much visual information for modern eyes." He is careful to avoid using the set decoration, a combination of period furniture and scenic art, to judge or insult the characters.
"They're more complex," he said. "They're not simply out to say, 'Anything you can have I can have bigger."'
Sexist scenery
Smith designed the perfect kitchen for "Lessons in Chemistry," immersing herself in the most technologically advanced appliances and finishes the late 1950s could offer. Then she showed her findings to Brie Larson, an executive producer and a star of the series, premiering on Oct. 13 on Apple TV+. Larson plays Elizabeth Zott, a brilliant chemist who finds herself hosting "Supper at Six," a popular cooking show.
Larson loved Smith's ideas for the "Supper at Six" kitchen, Smith recalled, saying it was just what Elizabeth would have chosen. But that was a problem: Throughout the series, based on the best seller by Bonnie Garmus, Elizabeth is stymied in her career by men who resent her, distrust her, believe they know better. The show set, Larson reasoned, would be dictated not by Elizabeth's taste but by what the station executives assumed women would want. That's how the kitchen became so frilly and so worryingly pink.
Having studied both "I Love Lucy" and Julia Child's "The French Chef," Smith settled on a lightened version of Benjamin Moore's Cat's Meow, which resembles the interior of a particularly girlie seashell. The kitchen island and lower cabinets have turquoise detailing, meant to provide some contrast, particularly in the black-and-white shots. The appliances are all period-appropriate -- they don't actually work, but water or propane can be piped through when necessary.
"We were very specific about what was available and what wasn't," Smith said. "Strangely enough, you can find most of these things on eBay."
The wallpaper, a nightmare of stripes and cherries, came courtesy of a Los Angeles company that scans and prints retro patterns. The linoleum tile was tougher to find, but it was eventually sourced, too. There are lacy curtains on the windows, and knickknacks -- figurines, wax fruit, cozies -- on every flat surface. During her first broadcast, Elizabeth orders these tchotchkes removed. Later, she brings in scientific equipment.
The set illustrates a tension between form and function, which the series mirrors. Because Elizabeth looks a certain way, the men in power expect her to conform to certain behaviors. In a lab coat and pedal pushers, she defies those expectations.
This show kitchen isn't practical or comfortable, and it seems too pink a space for fomenting liberation. But in Elizabeth's hands, that's what it becomes.
Creative destruction
The Continental Hotel, a luxury property with an all-assassin clientele, is a staple of the John Wick films. Those movies used the facade of Lower Manhattan's Beaver Building to represent the hotel. But for "The Continental: From the World of John Wick," a three-part prequel mini-series debuting on Peacock on Sept. 22, the owners of the building declined to grant the rights to its image.
Boughton described this denial as "an obstacle with an opportunity inside." He designed a new facade -- more rococo, more redolent of a secret society -- and he took a similarly expansive approach to the Continental's lobby.
Even in the earlier films, the lobby had undergone different iterations. "So many films have deep concerns about being consistent and making sure this is just so, and the Wick world doesn't do that," he said. "They just do art. So in many ways, it was one of the most liberating things."
The series was shot in Budapest, and for this version of the lobby, meant to represent the Continental in 1970s New York, the production filmed in the British embassy, which boasts a dazzling skylight. Because the series takes place in a moment of violent transition for the hotel, Boughton and his team filled that space with nods to the 1970s -- a cigarette vending machine, a bank of phone booths, upholstery in shades of avocado and rust -- along with details that look backward to the beaux arts period.
"It's a Frankenstein of styles," Boughton said.
Boughton created a new version of the guest services desk, staffed by Charon (Lance Reddick in the films, Ayomide Aden here). While Boughton confessed that he had saved on the upholstery -- those sofas are not upholstered in real leather -- the bar is real walnut, which gave it the necessary heft on camera before and after its destruction.
If you have seen a John Wick movie, it isn't a spoiler to suggest that the lobby may sustain some collateral damage. Which means that Boughton had to design it twice: once in pristine form and once post-catastrophe. (That catastrophe is achieved by a crew armed with sledgehammers and drills.)
"There is some sadness when you see a beautifully manufactured walnut bar just smashed to bits," Boughton admitted. But he also said that what he called the "aftermath" scenes were about as much fun as a production designer could have on set, taking all of that hard work and, for the good of the story, savaging it.
"It's quite a kick," he said.

The Pluses and Minuses To Plugging In Your New iPhone: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The dream of carrying one power cable for all your devices is becoming a reality. But things aren't as simple as they sound.
The iPhone 15 (technically, the 17th iteration of the iconic Apple phone) has arrived with a big change that is sure to annoy many of us. Eventually, however, we'll breathe a sigh of relief.
Allow me to unpack that. To comply with recent European regulations, the iPhone 15, unveiled Tuesday, will abandon the Lightning connector that has been the method for charging iPhones for 11 years. In its place will be a different oval-shaped connector: USB-C.
For the average tech user, change isn't fun. This all means that when Apple customers buy their next iPhones, they will no longer be able to plug in all the Lightning accessories they have collected, such as charging cables, speaker docks and earbuds. They will have to replace those with new products that use USB-C connectors to plug into the new iPhones.
This transition feels like a bit of déjà vu. In 2012, Apple killed the relatively bulky 30-pin connector on iPhones to switch to Lightning, a slimmer and faster charging technology, which rendered many speakers and chargers obsolete.
What's different this time is that most of us already have a USB-C cable. Modern headphones, game consoles and many laptops, including Apple's MacBooks, long ago adopted USB-C as a standard charging port. The iPhone was one of the holdouts.
Why is this happening now? Last year, the European Union announced a mandate requiring all smartphone makers to adopt USB-C as a common charging connector by 2024. In theory, this will allow consumers to buy fewer power cables, which, regulators say, could cut down on environmental waste. Thierry Breton, a European commissioner involved in the legislation, said on LinkedIn this month: "A common charger is common sense."
So we are heading toward an era of standardization in which one type of charger works with most of our electronics, which would be ideal. Many of us are familiar with the scenario in which someone is carrying an iPhone cable but a family member or friend needs a different one (likely a USB-C) to replenish their non-Apple phone or computer. Those days, in theory, will be no more.
But as is always the case with any big technology shift, it's not as simple as it sounds. New dangers lie ahead -- including the ability to destroy your phone with the wrong USB-C wire, phone repair experts say. If you're going to carry only one cable, it's more important than ever to be judicious about what you buy.
"Charger damage is a real thing," said Jessa Jones, the owner of iPad Rehab, a mobile phone and tablet repair shop. "It's very common, and it's something you need to watch out for."
Here's what to know:
Not all USB-C cables are created equal.
The first step is to stop thinking about modern charging cables as dumb wires.
High-quality chargers are essentially electronics with tiny circuit boards inside them. On Apple's official Lightning cable, there are two chips: One authenticates that the cable is made by Apple, while the other acts as a fuse that isolates damage to the charger. In the event of a power fluctuation, for example, only the charger would be destroyed and not the phone itself, Ms. Jones said.
The problem with USB-C cables is that while they usually look the same, the cheaper, low-quality cords offer no such protection for your device. They may have the correct oval connector, but inside, they lack chips to protect your phone.
So if you need a USB-C cable, don't grab any cheap wire, like the $ 5 ones you'll see at a gas station kiosk. Invest in a durable cable from a reputable company. Brands like Anker, Belkin and Amazon Basics are well known for their high-quality power cables that cost roughly $ 9 to $ 30, according to John Bumstead, the owner of RDKL Inc., a repair shop that refurbishes MacBooks. Buy the cables from trusted retailers or directly from the brands themselves -- and avoid purchasing used wires on sites like eBay.

The lesson here is to be careful about what you plug your cord into.

For iPhone owners who aren't planning on upgrading right away but need new chargers, the most cost-effective alternative to buying another Lightning cable is to go wireless. The E.U. mandate applies only to wires that plug directly into devices -- not wireless charging devices that replenish your phone via magnetic induction, such as Apple's puck-shaped MagSafe, which magnetizes to the back of your phone, or wireless charging pads and stands from brands like Mophie, Anker and Belkin. So those are fine purchases for the foreseeable future.
Bottom Line
As long as you own a robust cable and a nice charging brick, you will probably be happy with this transition. The USB-C charging standard is faster at transferring data than Lightning, and there may even be some cool perks, like the ability to plug your phone directly into an external display to look at photos.
More important, when you're traveling or commuting, you will no longer have to carry a jungle of wires in your bag, and if you leave your cable at home, chances are you'll be near someone who is carrying the same one.

How to Navigate Apple’s Shift From Lightning to USB-C

Full text: Enlarge this image.
SAN FRANCISCO — The iPhone 15 (technically, the 17th iteration of the iconic Apple phone) has arrived with a big change that is sure to annoy many of us. Eventually, however, we’ll breathe a sigh of relief.
Allow me to unpack that. To comply with recent European regulations, the iPhone 15, unveiled Tuesday, will abandon the Lightning connector that has been the method for charging iPhones for 11 years. In its place will be a different oval-shaped connector: USB-C.
For the average tech user, change isn’t fun. This all means that when Apple customers buy their next iPhones, they will no longer be able to plug in all the Lightning accessories they have collected, such as charging cables, speaker docks and earbuds. They will have to replace those with new products that use USB-C connectors to plug into the new iPhones.
This transition feels like a bit of déjà vu. In 2012, Apple killed the relatively bulky 30-pin connector on iPhones to switch to Lightning, a slimmer and faster charging technology, which rendered many speakers and chargers obsolete.
What’s different this time is that most of us already have a USB-C cable. Modern headphones, game consoles and many laptops, including Apple’s MacBooks, long ago adopted USB-C as a standard charging port. The iPhone was one of the holdouts.
Why is this happening now? Last year, the European Union announced a mandate requiring all smartphone makers to adopt USB-C as a common charging connector by 2024. In theory, this will allow consumers to buy fewer power cables, which, regulators say, could cut down on environmental waste. Thierry Breton, a European commissioner involved in the legislation, said on LinkedIn this month: “A common charger is common sense.”
So we are heading toward an era of standardization in which one type of charger works with most of our electronics, which would be ideal. Many of us are familiar with the scenario in which someone is carrying an iPhone cable but a family member or friend needs a different one (likely a USB-C) to replenish their non-Apple phone or computer. Those days, in theory, will be no more.
But as is always the case with any big technology shift, it’s not as simple as it sounds. New dangers lie ahead — including the ability to destroy your phone with the wrong USB-C wire, phone repair experts say. If you’re going to carry only one cable, it’s more important than ever to be judicious about what you buy.
“Charger damage is a real thing,” said Jessa Jones, the owner of iPad Rehab, a mobile phone and tablet repair shop. “It’s very common, and it’s something you need to watch out for.”
Here’s what to know:
Not all USB-C cables are created equal.
The first step is to stop thinking about modern charging cables as dumb wires.
High-quality chargers are essentially electronics with tiny circuit boards inside them. On Apple’s official Lightning cable, there are two chips: One authenticates that the cable is made by Apple, while the other acts as a fuse that isolates damage to the charger. In the event of a power fluctuation, for example, only the charger would be destroyed and not the phone itself, Jones said.
The problem with USB-C cables is that while they usually look the same, the cheaper, low-quality cords offer no such protection for your device. They may have the correct oval connector, but inside, they lack chips to protect your phone.
So if you need a USB-C cable, don’t grab any cheap wire, like the $5 ones you’ll see at a gas station kiosk. Invest in a durable cable from a reputable company. Brands such as Anker, Belkin and Amazon Basics are well known for their high-quality power cables that cost roughly $9 to $30, according to John Bumstead, the owner of RDKL Inc., a repair shop that refurbishes MacBooks. Buy the cables from trusted retailers or directly from the brands themselves — and avoid purchasing used wires on sites such as eBay.
Be careful what you plug into.

It May Look Like A Furniture Shop, But It's a Museum: [Sports Desk]

Full text: In Mineola, N.Y., Rosini Furniture Service restores and refinishes, but its owner's true passion is the racket sport.
Rosini Furniture Service is a business that seems like a front for a tennis museum.
In the inconspicuous storefront with a faded sign along an industrial stretch of Herricks Road in Mineola, Long Island, across from a truck repair shop, the smell of shellac and the clatter of tools emanate from rear work rooms. But all around the margins are displays of the sport's memorabilia and history.
About 15 years ago, the restoration service's owner, John Rosini, an avid player and tennis history buff, began collecting old rackets and marveling at how similar their construction and handiwork was to fine furniture.
His collecting grew to include photos, trophies and other items, which he began displaying for friends and any interested customers.
"Someone might come in to get a chair refinished and start looking around and suddenly they don't care about their chair anymore," said Mr. Rosini of his customers' fascination with his tennis collection. "And the ones who play tennis say, 'Oh my God."'
Rosini's family business, which has done high-end work for the likes of the Metropolitan Museum and the Rockefeller family, opened 75 years ago in Queens near the Forest Hills tennis stadium. The shop has become an unofficial museum of the sport's antiquities and collectibles.
"It's definitely taken on a life of its own," said Mr. Rosini, who began by arranging items around his office, but soon annexed the narrow showroom.
Fabric samples on the walls gave way to his collectibles, and "the tennis stuff just took over," he said, walking past a display rack of antique tennis rackets set up in front of shelves of furniture books. Long rolls of upholstery material were stowed overhead.
Even the bathroom has been converted to a display room, with dozens of vintage ball cans lining the walls, and shelves with binders of photos, U.S. Open programs and copies of World Tennis magazine from the 1960s.
"It doesn't interfere with me running the business, and it allows me to enjoy the collection," said Mr. Rosini, who has roughly 2,500 tennis books as well as scores of autographs, programs and photos, and 1,000 rackets ranging from the 1800s to one Roger Federer brought to the 2004 U.S. Open.
In a room lined with workbenches and tool racks, dozens of antique rackets are temporarily stowed under a finishing table. Dozens of boxed tennis items were shelved near a midcentury modern coffee table and an 18th-century secretary that were being restored.
Last weekend, the Tennis Collectors of America visited the shop as part of their annual meeting in New York City.
"There are very few collections like this one and they're almost all in private houses and most are not displayed like this," said one member, Richard A. Hillway, a tennis historian.
Mr. Rosini buys items online, at auction, and purchases collections through word of mouth from other collectors.
"I have a compulsive personality. I'm always searching for that one gem," said Mr. Rosini, who has lucked into stray donations from customers.
On occasion, Mr. Rosini has bartered furniture work for a choice item. Once, his delivery guy brought him a racket signed by Roger Federer that had been recovered from a wealthy customer's garage. The retired pro Gene Mayer, whom Mr. Rosini knows from church, donated his career trophies.
Mr. Rosini would not divulge what he has spent on the collection, which goes back to the beginnings of outdoor tennis in 19th-century England. But he has thousands of items, ranging from postcards that cost a few bucks apiece to rare rackets that cost as much as $ 5,000.
He paid a New Zealand collector $ 2,500 for an early automatic ball server created by René Lacoste, and he spent $ 3,000 for a set of racket-style trophies from the 1884 Wentworth tournament in New Hampshire.
Having run out of display space, Mr. Rosini's buying is restricted by his wife, Rita, who monitors his eBay notifications and is not above changing the account password to impose moratoriums.
"I'm like an addict -- I need accountability," he said.
The furniture business still pays the bills, but Mr. Rosini said he plans on making the collection available for tours, and his dream is to open it as a museum.
"I really want this to be seen," he said.

Hillway, a tennis historian. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY LANNA APISUKH FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) This article appeared in print on page B8.

Scandal Adds to Woes Facing the British Museum: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: After it fired a worker for theft and its director stepped down, the museum faces renewed calls to give back contested objects and an uphill battle to raise funds for refurbishment.
Visitors to the British Museum this week could be forgiven for thinking it was business as usual.
In the museum's Egyptian galleries, tourists jostled to get a closer look at the Rosetta Stone. Nearby, a teenager posed for a photo in front of a huge statue from Easter Island. In another hall, art students sketched a sculpture of a centaur from the Parthenon Marbles.
But despite the air of normalcy, the world's third-most-visited museum is in crisis.
Since news broke in August that an employee had been fired over the theft of potentially thousands of items from its storerooms, the British Museum has struggled to deal with the fallout, which is exacerbating challenges it already faced.
The museum is now deluged with renewed calls for the restitution of contested objects, and raising a huge sum for an impending refurbishment looks even more difficult. At a time when it needs leadership most, the museum is rudderless, after its director, Hartwig Fischer, resigned on Aug. 25.
On top of those challenges, the institution has also recently been troubled by protests over a longstanding oil company sponsorship, shutdowns caused by striking workers and a flap over the uncredited use of a translator's work in a recent show.
Chris Smith, a former British culture minister, said the museum was "certainly going through a difficult patch." Its leadership needs to act decisively to restore its reputation, he said.
The British Museum could perhaps have muddled along if it were not for the thefts. But things started unraveling on Aug. 16, when the museum announced in a news release that it had fired a worker for stealing "gems of semiprecious stones and glass" from its storerooms.
Two years earlier, an antiquities dealer, Ittai Gradel, emailed the museum with what he said was proof that a senior British Museum curator was selling items from the collection on eBay. The museum initially dismissed Gradel's concerns but later made an about-face. In an interview with BBC radio on Saturday, George Osborne, the museum's chairman, confirmed that the museum had fired the individual identified by Gradel, and said that at least 2,000 items had gone missing. (The British Museum declined to comment and a spokeswoman said Osborne was unavailable for an interview.)
In Britain, the thefts -- for which no one has been arrested -- have led to intense news media scrutiny of the museum's security procedures and put a spotlight on the museum's poor record-keeping.
Its digital archives include records for 4.5 million items, or about half the collection. The patchiness of the catalog has been the subject of criticism for decades. In 1988, the National Audit Office, a government watchdog, said in a report that the museum's stock-taking and inventories were "unsatisfactory." Because of "continuing staff shortages" it was "impossible" to say when the situation would improve, the report added.
Charles Saumarez Smith, a former director of the Royal Academy of Arts, said that other major British institutions, including the Victoria and Albert Museum, had largely completed computerized inventories since that damning report. "The big question is, why didn't the British Museum?" he said.
Osborne, the British Museum chairman, conceded in the BBC interview that inventory keeping was a problem and said that gaps in those records could be exploited. But he insisted that the museum's global treasures were safe.
Even with such reassurances, lawmakers and museum administrators in Greece and Nigeria used the thefts as an opportunity to reiterate their calls for the return of the Parthenon Marbles, sometimes called the Elgin Marbles, and the British Museum's collection of Benin Bronzes.
Many of the artifacts in the museum's collection, which was founded in 1753, were obtained when Britain ruled large swaths of the world, and were acquired by colonial officials and soldiers, as well as traveling anthropologists and natural historians. For decades, some activists and academics have viewed the museum's collection as a cultural extension of empire, often highlighting the most controversial items in its collection.
After the killing of George Floyd in the United States in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, the museum's collection came under even more intense scrutiny. It took some steps to highlight its links to slavery, including those of Hans Sloane, a physician whose collection formed the basis of the museum.
Lina Mendoni, Greece's culture minister, said in a statement that "the deplorable incident of theft" at the British Museum raised "a major question regarding the conditions of the protection and security of all of its exhibits." Any argument that the Parthenon Marbles are safer in London than Greece had "collapsed," she added.
As existing disputes heated up, the specter of new claims loomed. The Global Times, a tabloid newspaper in China that is widely seen as a government mouthpiece, said in an editorial on Monday that the British Museum should return all 23,000 Chinese relics in its collection to Beijing. The British Museum was filled with artifacts of "questionable origins," the newspaper added. (The Chinese Embassy in London did not respond to requests for comment.)
Nana Oforiatta Ayim, an art historian from Ghana who campaigns for the return of artifacts, said the thefts boosted the calls for restitution by all African countries, countering the "very racist and patriarchal and patronizing" claim that African artifacts were safer in European museums. Last week, Ayim said, the British Museum's woes were the "main topic" of conversation at a major restitution conference in Accra, Ghana.
If record-keeping and restitution claims are long-term problems for the museum, the crisis also highlighted more immediate issues. This fall, the British Museum is scheduled to announce a major refurbishment project that The Financial Times has reported will cost £1 billion, or about $ 1.27 billion. That program will involve rearranging the museum's collections, and upgrading its plumbing and electrical systems.
With pressure on government budgets, the British Museum is expected to rely on donors to pay for most of that program. But philanthropists are often not interested in paying for mundane, necessary infrastructure upgrades, and the thefts and their fallout could increase some donors' wariness to help with the project.
"An abrupt change in leadership always has consequences for philanthropy," said Leslie Ramos, the author of a forthcoming book on arts giving, adding that "donors don't want to be associated with bad apples."
To restore confidence, the British Museum has commissioned an independent review to examine what went wrong and recommend improvements to security. Osborne told the BBC that the museum would also "accelerate" the process of making "a complete register of the items in its collection," and that it had begun trying to recover all the lost items.
That could be difficult. Dick Ellis, a former leader of Scotland Yard's art and antiquities squad, said the museum might "have to litigate to recover some of the pieces," a costly process that might not even be possible if the artifacts have left Britain. Some countries, like Switzerland, allow buyers to keep artifacts if they were bought in good faith, Ellis said.
An interim director to lead the museum is scheduled to be announced within days, a museum spokeswoman said in an email. Smith, the former minister, said it was "not the easiest moment" for anyone to take over leadership of the British Museum, but he said there would be many applicants for the permanent job regardless of the myriad challenges.
"It is one of the most wonderful museum jobs in the world," Smith said. "There will be plenty of people who will relish the opportunity."

Full text: To follow an olive-sided flycatcher, first you have to catch it.
For an olive-sided flycatcher, migration can be a marathon. Some of the soot-colored songbirds travel more than 15,000 miles a year, winging their way from South America to Alaska and then back again. It's a dizzyingly long journey for a bird that weighs just over an ounce.
"Alaska populations of olive-sided flycatchers are just on this razor-thin margin of what's biologically possible," said Julie Hagelin, a wildlife research biologist at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and a senior research scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
To survive the long trip, the birds need safe places to rest and refuel. But the locations of these "little utopias" were a mystery, Dr. Hagelin said. So in 2013, she and her colleagues set out to unravel it by tracking the birds. They hoped that identifying the critical stopover sites might provide clues about why olive-sided flycatcher populations were declining and what might be needed to save them, including where experts should target their conservation efforts.
The research proved to be more difficult than they had bargained for. Olive-sided flycatchers often breed in buggy bogs. They perch at the tops of trees. And they are elusive, sparse on the landscape and difficult to catch. "After the first year of struggling with this project, it became really, really clear why nobody in their right mind would want to try and study this bird," Dr. Hagelin said.
Here's what it took for scientists to get the data:
Make a lure
Olive-sided flycatchers can be highly sensitive to incursions into their territory, so the scientists lured the birds with fake avian rivals. They bought wooden bird decoys on eBay, and then painted white patches on the flanks to replicate the flash of white feathers that males often show when they're agitated. "It's kind of a long distance signal of 'Keep away' or 'This is my spot,"' Dr. Hagelin said.
Catch a flycatcher
The researchers attached the decoys to small trees or tied them to large sticks that were positioned upright in the soft ground. They strung up fine mist nests and played flycatcher calls from speakers hidden in the bushes underneath the decoy. The scientists hoped that if a real flycatcher was in the area, it would fly at the wooden interloper and wind up in their nets. Some birds did just that, responding quickly to the decoy. But sometimes it could take hours to catch just one flycatcher. "Maybe two, if we were lucky," Dr. Hagelin said.
Attach a tag
The researchers used clear plastic cord -- designed for making beaded jewelry -- to fashion tiny flycatcher harnesses, each bearing a geolocator tag. Once they had a bird in hand, they slipped the loops of the harness over its legs, positioning the tag against its lower back.
When the birds flew south for the winter, the geolocator tags regularly recorded the light levels and the time, allowing the scientists to estimate each bird's approximate latitude and longitude. In later years of the study, they transitioned to using GPS tags, which can provide more precise location data.
Do it again a year later
To download the data, the researchers had to recapture the same birds the next summer. "Recovering this information added to my gray hairs," Dr. Hagelin said. The second time around, the birds were warier and less responsive to the scientists' trickery, so the researchers spent hours watching flycatcher nests.
"You can start to see patterns like locations or directions that the birds tend to exit or enter the nest and how they're moving through the trees," Dr. Hagelin said. "So you can put a net in the way and hope you'll catch them that way."
Cross your fingers
Over the course of the five-year study, the researchers managed to deploy 95 tags. They recovered 17 geolocator tags but just five GPS tags -- and three of the GPS tags failed, providing no data at all for reasons the scientists still do not understand. "That was really devastating," Dr. Hagelin said.
"But all was not lost," she added. The geolocator data pointed to 13 important stopover sites, from Washington to southern Peru, plus three main wintering areas in South America, the researchers reported in 2021. Tagging technology has improved, so scientists with an appetite for flycatcher catching could now focus on collecting more detailed data on those locations. "Am I the person to do it?" Dr. Hagelin said. "Maybe if I had the funding."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Hartwig Fischer, who had led the museum since 2016, said that the museum's failure to adequately respond to earlier warnings "must ultimately rest with the director."
Just days after the British Museum announced that it had fired an employee who was suspected of looting its storerooms and selling items on eBay, the museum's director announced Friday that he was resigning, effective immediately.
Hartwig Fischer, a German art historian who had led the world renowned institution since 2016, said in a news release that he was leaving the post at a time "of the utmost seriousness."
Mr. Fischer, 60, said that it was "evident" that under his leadership the museum did not adequately respond to warnings that a curator may be stealing items. "The responsibility for that failure must ultimately rest with the director," Mr. Fischer said.
A few hours after Mr. Fischer's resignation, the museum announced that its deputy director, Jonathan Williams, had also "agreed to voluntarily step back from his normal duties" until an investigation into the thefts was complete.
Trouble has been brewing at the British Museum since it announced last week that items had been stolen from its collection. The museum did not say how many objects were taken, or how valuable they were. But it said the missing, stolen or damaged pieces included "gold jewelry and "gems of semiprecious stones and glass" dating from as far back as the 15th century B.C.
Ever since, a stream of revelations around the museum's handling of the thefts undermined Mr. Fischer's position. On Tuesday, The New York Times and the BBC published emails showing that Mr. Fischer had downplayed concerns raised by Ittai Gradel, a Denmark-based antiquities dealer, about potential thefts.
In an email to a trustee in October 2022, Mr. Fischer said that "the case has been thoroughly investigated," adding that "there is no evidence to substantiate the allegations."
Mr. Fischer initially defended his response, saying in a statement on Wednesday that his handling of the allegations had been robust and that the museum had taken the warnings "incredibly seriously." The extent of the problem only became clear later, he said, after the museum undertook "a full audit" of its collections.
His defense did little to quell criticism in Britain. On Wednesday, The Times of London wrote that the thefts were "a national disgrace, calling into question the museum's own claims for its stewardship of cultural treasures, and for which it needs to give a full accounting."
The unfolding drama was also watched closely in countries that seek the return of pieces in the British Museum's vast collection, which includes more than eight million items, many from Britain's former colonies. Lawmakers in Greece and Nigeria used the thefts as an opportunity to call for the return of contested artifacts.
Lina Mendoni, Greece's culture minister, said in an interview on Monday with To Vima, a Greek newspaper, that the case reinforced her country's demands for the return of the Parthenon Marbles, a series of sculptures and frieze panels, sometimes known as the Elgin Marbles, that once decorated the Parthenon in Athens. The thefts raised questions about the "safety and integrity of all of the museum's exhibits," Ms. Mendoni said.
And on Thursday, Nigerian officials reiterated their longstanding call for the British Museum to return a collection of artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes, which British troops looted in 1897.
Mr. Fischer's time at the museum coincided with a sea change in attitudes over what rightfully belongs in the West's museums, and an increase in the volume and intensity of restitution demands. He took over at the British Museum in 2016, having formerly run the State Art Collections of Dresden, a prestigious collection of museums in Germany.
In late July, shortly before the news broke that the museum had fired a worker suspected of theft, Mr. Fischer announced that he would step down next year. But as the crisis at the museum deepened this week, his position looked increasingly untenable.
The turmoil has come at "a very bad moment," said Charles Saumarez Smith, a former director of the Royal Academy of Arts, in London. The British Museum is expected to announce a major renovation project that The Financial Times has reported will cost £1 billion, or about $ 1.26 billion, and the current uncertainty could make fund-raising much more difficult, he said.
The resignation was "an act of symbolic bloodletting," Mr. Saumarez Smith said, but it may not end the British Museum's woes. There are clearly "bigger issues that need to be resolved" at the institution, he added, including the questions about whether it has a handle on its inventory.
Mr. Fischer said in his statement that he expected the museum to "come through this moment and emerge stronger" but that he had "come to the conclusion that my presence is proving a distraction."
"That is the last thing I would want," he said.
George Osborne, the museum chair, said in the release that the board had accepted Mr. Fischer's decision. "I am clear about this: We are going to fix what has gone wrong," Mr. Osborne said. "The museum has a mission that lasts across generations. We will learn, restore confidence and deserve to be admired once again."

Turning the Tables On a Corporate Critic: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Francis deSouza, the chief executive of the biotechnology giant Illumina, didn't know what he was in for when he resisted Carl Icahn's demand in March for three seats on the company's board.
Mr. Icahn, the billionaire investor, hired a private investigator to dig up dirt on Mr. deSouza. He wrote letters to Illumina shareholders lambasting Mr. deSouza's leadership and publicized details of his divorce. By June, Mr. deSouza and the chairman of Illumina had resigned. One of Mr. Icahn's allies joined the board.
Such bare-knuckle tactics have made Mr. Icahn the nightmare of many a chief executive and changed the fate of some of America's best-known companies, including Apple, RJR Nabisco, Blockbuster and Netflix.
But in May, Mr. Icahn, 87, found out what it's like to be on the receiving end when Nathan Anderson, a 39-year-old short seller, published a report questioning the setup at Icahn Enterprises, his publicly traded company. Mr. Anderson suggested that the company was paying shareholders a dividend it could not afford. This month, Icahn Enterprises succumbed to the pressure, slashing its dividend by half.
"It is very, very embarrassing for Carl because this guy beat him and beat him at his own game," said Mark Stevens, the author of a 1993 book titled "King Icahn: The Biography of a Renegade Capitalist."
Mr. Icahn scoffed at comparisons between himself and Mr. Anderson, whose short-selling firm, Hindenburg Research, has made news recently for its attacks on companies like the electric vehicle maker Nikola and the Adani Group, one of India's most powerful conglomerates.
"He goes out and scares the little guy into selling stock at the worst time and taking big losses," Mr. Icahn said during one of several phone interviews over the past month, referring to everyday investors. He said Mr. Anderson hadn't called him before publishing the report, denying him the opportunity to present his side of things.
Short sellers borrow stock held by big investors and sell it in the open market, betting that its price will fall. If they bet right, they can buy the borrowed shares back at the lower price, return them and pocket the difference. Hindenburg publishes research supporting its short bets.
Mr. Icahn buys and holds stocks for years, he said, and makes changes from the inside. "I'm not telling you I'm a charity organization," he said. But "what we do is very admirable." In a recent earnings release, he said investors who bought his company's stock in January 2000 and reinvested their dividends would have done far better than any stock index. (As of July 31, he said, his investors would have an annualized return of 12.8 percent, compared with 6.9 percent for the S&P 500.)
Mr. Icahn was one of the first corporate raiders -- now known as activist investors -- who bought stakes in companies and pushed management to make changes. His main vehicle was a hedge fund until 2007, when he folded it into a publicly traded entity he also owned. The new entity, Icahn Enterprises, diversified beyond activism and holds stocks, real estate and other investments.
Mr. Icahn, who friends and acquaintances say often drinks a martini or two in between haranguing chief executives late at night, discovered his appetite for rattling company cages in the late 1970s.
Born in 1936 in Far Rockaway, Queens, the only child of a cantor at a synagogue and a schoolteacher, Mr. Icahn attended Princeton University, where he worked in the dining hall to help pay for his tuition. At his mother's urging, he attended New York University's medical school before dropping out. After a brief stint in the Army, he went to work on Wall Street. In 1968, he started his own investment firm with a loan from his uncle.
One of his first successes came when he pushed Tappan, a family-owned company that made ovens, to sell to a larger competitor. The campaign made him roughly $ 3 million.
He became a household name in the 1980s for his attempts to take over some of that decade's most prominent companies. In 1985, he bought Trans World Airlines. His tumultuous reign as chairman began with battles with the flight attendants' union that grounded the airline for weeks when they went on strike. It ended, mostly, when TWA declared bankruptcy in 1992. Along the way, Mr. Icahn piled debt on the company, which allowed him to take out cash and generate a profit for himself.
One of his big victories involved RJR Nabisco, the food and tobacco giant that he pushed to split into two beginning in 1996. When the company eventually spun off its food business, Mr. Icahn pocketed $ 884 million by the time he sold his stock in late 2000.
In 2011, he began a multiyear attack on the drug company Forest Labs, accusing it of destroying shareholder value. He ousted the chief executive and pushed for a sale. Shares of Forest Labs tripled during that time, netting Mr. Icahn about $ 2 billion in profit. He also successfully pushed Apple to buy back its stock in 2013, which made him $ 1.8 billion by the time he sold his stake.
Mr. Icahn estimated that his activist campaigns at a dozen companies, including Apple, eBay and PayPal, Forest Labs, Herbalife and Netflix, had helped generate $ 300 billion in additional value for the shareholders of those companies. The bulk of it came from Apple.
Forbes estimated Mr. Icahn's fortune at $ 18 billion earlier this year, although that number has been cut roughly in half since the Hindenburg report.
Still, Mr. Icahn's bets haven't always worked out for him or the target. When he joined the board of Blockbuster Video in 2005, John Antioco, the chief executive of the company, was surprised at how little Mr. Icahn knew about the business.
"Once Carl catches the bus, I'm not sure he knows what to do with it," Mr. Antioco said. Still, he said Mr. Icahn supported his plans to move Blockbuster's business online. In 2007, after a battle over compensation, Mr. Antioco resigned. He said he was taken aback when Mr. Icahn brought in a new chief executive who refocused on retail stores. Blockbuster declared bankruptcy a few years later.
Mr. Icahn, who called Blockbuster his "worst investment ever," said he blamed himself for allowing the new chief executive to focus on retail. "We almost made it great."
He has also lost money on some recent activist campaigns. The stock of Xerox, where he's the largest shareholder, is down since he took a stake in 2015. International Flavors & Fragrances is trading at roughly half the price that it was when he bought shares in early 2022. Illumina, which is now searching for a new chief executive, is down about 20 percent since Mr. Icahn began his campaign.
At the same time, friends said, money is not what drives Mr. Icahn.
"It sounds corny, but money is just not that important to Carl," said Buzzy Krongard, a director at Icahn Enterprises and a longtime friend who overlapped with him as an undergraduate at Princeton. "It's winning that's important," Mr. Krongard said. "Carl enjoys the battle itself."
Often, the battle extends beyond activism. In 2003, the real estate developer Harry Macklowe bought the General Motors Building in Manhattan for a record-setting price of $ 1.4 billion. Mr. Icahn, a friend of Mr. Macklowe's, had a lease at a below-market rate for one of the top floors of the 50-story building that was about to expire.
When one of the brokers for Mr. Macklowe's firm approached Mr. Icahn about a new lease with higher rent, he yelled at the broker to leave his office. He wouldn't engage in any conversations with Mr. Macklowe or his team, according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations. It was only when they began giving tours to prospective tenants and lined one up that Mr. Icahn agreed to negotiate a new lease.
A night owl who plays tennis almost every day, Mr. Icahn said he usually rises before the stock market opens but is known to work past midnight. Employees are known to keep notebooks next to their night stands in case their boss calls after they fall asleep, although Mr. Icahn said he rarely called employees after midnight.
Friends and associates of Mr. Icahn said he bets on everything from poker games to chess matches. Once, when he was in Las Vegas, he even bet a million dollars that the San Francisco 49ers would win the Super Bowl. (They won, netting him a few hundred thousand dollars.) But it's the high-stakes betting on companies -- and the chance to influence their future -- that he finds thrilling, they said.
Mr. Icahn and his 44-year-old son, Brett, are controlling shareholders of Icahn Enterprises, with 85 percent of the stock. Outside shareholders -- mostly retail investors -- own the rest. In 2020, Mr. Icahn said in regulatory filings that his son would succeed him by 2027, but he remains the face of the company for now.
In May, Hindenburg published research suggesting that Icahn Enterprises was valued more highly than its peers because it paid a lucrative dividend to shareholders despite reporting quarterly losses, which kept investors buying the stock. "Icahn has been using money taken in from new investors to pay out dividends to old investors," Mr. Anderson wrote, comparing it to a "Ponzi-like economic structure" that was unsustainable.
Mr. Anderson also suggested that if Icahn Enterprises stopped paying dividends, the value of its stock would fall, which meant that Mr. Icahn would struggle to repay billions of dollars he had borrowed against his personal stake in the company. That could set off a downward spiral. Mr. Anderson also accused Mr. Icahn of inflating the value of his private investments.
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice started investigations into Mr. Icahn's business practices after the Hindenburg report.
The stock of Icahn Enterprises fell more than 50 percent after the Hindenburg report, compelling Mr. Icahn to renegotiate the terms of his loans in July, which "significantly diffused" the effects of the report. This month, the company also cut its dividend by half.
He recently acknowledged that his firm's short bet against the S&P 500 had cost him roughly $ 9 billion over roughly six years and told investors that he would refocus on activism.
Mr. Anderson said Mr. Icahn could still struggle to repay his loans and refinance some of the debt given the high interest rates. "The next chapter of his financial high-wire act will be difficult."
Mr. Icahn said higher rates were immaterial to his company's performance. He is as determined as ever to use his billions of borrowed money to go after his next targets, using his activist's instinct honed over a nearly five-decade career.
When he sees a potentially winning investment, "you take as much money as you can that's available and buy that stock as far as you can go," Mr. Icahn said. "That's where you make the money."

When he sees a potentially winning investment, “you take as much money as you can that’s available and buy that stock as far as you can go,” Icahn said. “That’s where you make the money.”

The Humblest of Chairs Quickly Becomes a Symbol: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It figured prominently in viral footage of a brawl, where it was used as a blunt instrument. So why is the humble folding chair now turning up on T-shirts, earrings and at least one tattoo?
Within hours of a fight breaking out on an Alabama riverfront this month, images and video clips from the brawl began to ricochet online. Then came the memes. After that, it wasn't long until the merchandise started to appear.
On Aug. 5, a group of white boaters attacked Dameion Pickett, a Black riverboat captain, after he instructed them to dock their pontoon elsewhere as the space was reserved for a larger vessel. A group of mostly Black bystanders rushed to his defense. In the aftermath of the brawl, a white folding chair -- an unlikely weapon that one man was seen wielding over his head during the encounter -- has emerged as a joking-but-not-really symbol of resistance against perceived racial aggression.
On TikTok, #boatfight and #montgomerybrawl videos have racked up tens of millions of views. Listings have flourished by the dozens on retailers like Redbubble, Etsy and eBay. Earrings, necklaces, mugs, T-shirts and window decals have all been fashioned in the image of the folding chair in recent weeks.
By Aug. 10, four people wanted in connection with the brawl had turned themselves in to the Montgomery Police Department. Reggie Ray, the man accused of using the chair in the altercation, has also been charged with disorderly conduct.
Since then, there has been a growing market for all things folding chairs. At least two online auctions advertising what was allegedly the white chair actually used in the brawl, one of which was listed for $ 35,000, abruptly ended "because there was an error in the listing," according to eBay.
For Tamika Hicks of Louisburg, N.C., however, the chair represented much more than a cash grab. Ms. Hicks, 38, a full-time health care worker who runs an Etsy handicraft shop on the side, said that she had fallen into this unusual cottage industry by accident, having originally made a pair of folding chair earrings for a friend after seeing the brawl online. After a robust response to her Facebook post showing off the earrings, she saw an opportunity to generate more income. She said she had received close to 1,000 orders this month.
"People just don't understand the power of social media," Ms. Hicks said. "Something that went viral has brought in other forms of income for me as a single mom. I'm also able to be a part of this conversation and to continue it."
Jasmine Green, a visual artist in Pittsburgh, moved quickly to capitalize on the moment. On her website, she is selling chair earrings of her own design that have the words "Try Me" carved into the center of the seat. She said she planned to send some of the profits after expenses to a fund set up for those who came to Mr. Pickett's defense, including Mr. Ray.
"Part of the celebration of this chair has been this idea of collective care," said Ms. Green, who is also the director of education at the nonprofit 1Hood Media Academy, which provides art, education and social justice programing to communities of color. "But I also want to remind people to make sure that we're also following up on those that were involved in the fight, if they need resources."
Uju Anya, an associate professor in Carnegie Mellon's department of modern languages, was given a pair of Ms. Green's "Try Me" earrings by her girlfriend and wore them to a Pittsburgh Steelers game, where she said they were complimented by strangers. To her, the earrings are more than just a comedic fashion trend.
"It's empowering and a collective sigh of relief," Professor Anya said.
Professor Anya suggested that the humor behind the white folding chair had a potency for one particular audience. "Anybody can generally understand a meme or TikTok," she said, "but the imagery of this chair is specific to us and has language very specific to Black people and Black culture."
Kaylen Sanders, a bank teller and a musician in Dallas, said he found himself deeply moved by the videos he saw online. "The fact that this didn't turn into something where guns came out, or anybody actually died or anything, it felt very relieving," Mr. Sanders said in an interview. He added that it was encouraging to watch other Black people come "to defend one Black man that very much could have been another cause."
"For me," he said, "it represented Black unity."
Instead of simply showing his support by buying a T-shirt or a cap, he decided to immortalized it on his skin: A new tattoo on his left arm reads "Montgomery, Alabama" along with the date "Aug. 5, 2023." A detailed line drawing of the folding chair is centered in the middle.
After a conversation with his fiancée, Camry Moss, the two landed on the idea for the tattoo. Two days after the brawl, he and Ms. Moss, who is a tattoo artist, sat down to commit the day to ink at his mother's house.
"I don't regret it, and it's not a joke," Mr. Sanders said. "I don't think over the years I'll be like, 'Oh, why did I do this?"'
According to Ravi Dhar, a behavioral scientist at the Yale School of Management who specializes in consumer behavior and branding, any emotionally charged moment that fuses race and anxiety is bound to cause people to "feel connected."
"The unique thing here, too, was the location," Professor Dhar said. The brawl, which erupted in Montgomery's popular Riverfront Park, occurred at the same dock where enslaved Africans once arrived by steamboat to be sold in the center of town. (Although the fight appeared to break out along racial lines, the Montgomery police have said they do not plan to pursue hate crime charges.)
"It signals that not much has changed," he added, "but this chair seems to have offered a different perspective."
Professor Dhar compared the unlikely imagery of the folding chair to other moments in history that can be evoked with a single image or item: Colin Kaepernick taking a knee during the national anthem as a statement on police brutality, for instance, or the red hats of a Trump rally. In its visceral connection to the actual events themselves, the chair also conjures up memories of the umbrellas used by pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong to shield themselves from tear gas and pepper spray during the movement's 2014 street protests.
"This white chair is not something that's inherently violent," said Ms. Green, the artist, "which I think has allowed people to have this feeling of humor around it. But it's this unassuming object that plays such a vital role."

Gran Turismo Drove a Teenager to Prominence: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The PlayStation video game's realistic cars and racetracks helped Jann Mardenborough find his calling as a professional driver.
Jann Mardenborough can vividly recount the first time he ever played Gran Turismo, the popular racing video game that would completely alter his life.
While seeking refuge on Bonfire Night, a British holiday full of firework celebrations, an 8-year-old Mardenborough stumbled upon the game at his neighbors' house. He selected a violet Mitsubishi 3000GT and began racing on the Autumn Ring track. Mardenborough went on to play the game all night, and then every day after that, showing up at his neighbors' door immediately after school.
"They got so fed up with me turning up at their house, one day the wife came across the street, knocked on our door and had in hand the PlayStation and GT 1, and gave it to my parents," the 31-year-old racecar driver recently recalled during a video interview.
It's the origin story to the other origin story: the true, improbable one depicted in the film "Gran Turismo," which was directed by Neill Blomkamp and opens on Friday. The movie dramatizes Mardenborough's journey, from gaming in his bedroom to winning the 2011 GT Academy -- an annual competition that, from 2008 to 2016, put the game's best players in real vehicles -- to driving formula cars professionally.
The eight main games in the Gran Turismo franchise, which debuted in Europe and North America in 1998, are known for their scrupulously reproduced cars and exacting racing simulations. In the months before he attended GT Academy, Mardenborough upgraded from a plastic PlayStation controller to a homemade wooden racing frame along with a steering wheel and pedal that he bought with money his parents gave him for good grades.
The competition was a godsend for Mardenborough, who was trying to sell car parts on eBay after losing a retail job; he had dropped out of college after realizing that studying motor sport engineering did not mean he could actually drive the cars.
Even so, Mardenborough said he was skeptical of his chances. He had played Gran Turismo no more than an average teenage gamer after his initial fixation, had never competed in a tournament and had barely any experience driving a normal car. The first time he brought his rickety 1991 laser blue BMW E30 onto a highway was on his way to the competition.
Mardenborough's perspective took a visceral turn when he qualified for racing camp -- a stretch depicted in the film that follows the finalists training in actual cars -- and was given his first taste of the track.
"After my first few laps, when I got out the car, I remember thinking, 'I don't want to go through life never experiencing that again,"' said Mardenborough, who served as a producer on "Gran Turismo" and as the stunt double for his own character.
Mardenborough can eagerly describe the technicalities that distinguish game from reality -- the sensation, for instance, of the vibration through the car seat -- but said that much of the real-world feeling and reactions mirrored Gran Turismo.
"When you race against real people," he said, "everything is real."
Mardenborough, who is played by Archie Madekwe in "Gran Turismo," went line by line with Sony over early drafts of the script, which he noted is mostly true to his life. The characters played by David Harbour and Orlando Bloom are both fictionalized but loosely based on real people. And a crash involving Mardenborough in Germany that left a spectator dead really happened, although detractors have complained about how the tragic event was translated to the screen.
In the film, the crash occurs right before Mardenborough returns to the track for a podium finish at Le Mans, the famous endurance race in France -- back-to-back events that form an emotional arc of setback and triumph. In reality, Mardenborough's crash in Germany came two years after that podium finish, leading to criticism that the film's timeline was edited to serve a narratively pat movie ending.
"The order is the order, but those events happened in my life," Mardenborough, who avoided serious injuries, said in response. "This isn't a documentary." He did race in Le Mans one year after the crash, and Mardenborough said the emotional battle the film constructed was consistent with his feelings.
"When you believe the reason why you're put on earth is to race a racing car, and then you're asking yourself, 'Do I still want to do this?"' he said. "It's not a pleasant question to ask."
Mardenborough last competed in May and is talking to teams about potentially racing in the United States next year. And occasionally, the driver who fidgeted with a gaming steering wheel during our interview will still play Gran Turismo.
If he were to race against his 19-year-old self in the game right now, who would win? Mardenborough thought for a moment.
"Me," he said with a competitive smirk. "If I put in the amount of hours I did back then, considering my experience in real life, I would be quicker. But all it is is hours."

British Museum Was Warned About eBay Sales: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An antiquities dealer contacted the museum with concerns in 2021, but the institution swiftly closed the case, according to documents seen by The New York Times.
In 2021, British Museum officials were alerted to a potential thief in their ranks.
That year, Ittai Gradel, a Denmark-based dealer in ancient gems, contacted the august London institution with evidence that he said showed that three gems from the museum's collections had been offered for sale on eBay.
Museum officials were already aware that something was up with one of those artifacts. Another dealer, Malcolm Hay, had gotten in touch to say he had bought one of the gems but was concerned it was stolen. He returned the jewel to the museum in May 2021.
The thief must have been someone inside the institution, Mr. Gradel said in an email to the British Museum that has been obtained by The New York Times. He was concerned, he added, that the three gems were "only the tip of a much larger iceberg."
The British Museum opened an investigation that reached a swift conclusion, according to correspondence seen by The Times: that nothing untoward had happened.
Jonathan Williams, a deputy director at the museum, said in an email to Mr. Gradel that "the objects concerned are all accounted for and with no suggestion of any wrongdoing on behalf of any member of museum staff." In October 2022, Hartwig Fischer, the museum's director, told a trustee that the matter was closed, according to the correspondence. (Mr. Gradel and Mr. Hay declined to comment for this article.)
Now that decision appears to be coming back to haunt the museum.
Last week, the British Museum said in a news release that it had fired an unnamed staff member on suspicion of looting jewels from the collection, and had begun a review of its security practices. London's police force said it was investigating.
A museum spokeswoman declined at that time to say how many items were involved while the police investigation was ongoing, but the news release said that the stolen or damaged items included gold jewelry and "gems of semiprecious stones and glass," some dating as far back as the 15th century B.C.
On Tuesday, another spokeswoman declined to comment on the museum's 2021 investigation. "This is all now subject to the independent review and also the police investigation, so we can't comment further at this point," she said in an email.
London's police force said in a statement on Tuesday that it had not made any arrests in the case.
In the week since the news of the thefts broke, the case has been the subject of heated speculation in the British news media, with daily articles conjecturing over how many artifacts had been lost, and who was responsible.
Erin Thompson, a specialist in art crime at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said it was unusual for a major museum to go public with details of internal losses. "Normally, it's kept under wraps," she said. She said she hoped that other museums would follow the British Museum's example and be more open in future.
Other experts said the museum should have acted more quickly. Dick Ellis, the former head of Scotland Yard's art and antiquities squad, said he was shocked the museum appeared to take so little action in the two years since the alarm was raised.
To uncover what had happened, Mr. Ellis said, the British Museum would first need to ascertain what exactly had gone missing; then the police would need to get records from eBay or other auction sites to ascertain details about any completed or attempted sales. Then, Mr. Ellis added, the police would need to contact the items' buyers. If any buyers were based outside Britain, that could hamper inquiries.
Some similar investigations have lasted years without coming to a resolution. In 2020, Dirk Obbink, a former University of Oxford scholar, was arrested on suspicion of stealing and selling ancient papyri. He was released without charges as the Thames Valley Police continued to investigate, and a spokesman said this week that there had been no recent advancements in the case.
Last week, the British Museum announced a new independent review, led by Nigel Boardman, a former museum trustee, and Lucy D'Orsi, a British police official, to look into the thefts and make recommendations regarding future security arrangements. The British Museum spokeswoman said the organization would publish the results of the review, which is scheduled to be completed this year.
The museum is also looking to recover all the lost items. Mr. Ellis said that could be very difficult if the artifacts were sold years ago and had passed through several hands.
"I have sympathy for the museum, having to look after a collection this size," Mr. Ellis said. But, he added, "it is the museum's responsibility to do so."

Companies Adding Care for Menopause To Benefits Packages: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In an effort to attract and retain experienced women, some companies are adding menopause-specific care to their benefits packages.
In her late 40s, Celia Chen began experiencing unexplained symptoms like anxiety, a spike in blood sugar, acne and chronic pain in her shoulder -- all of which she attributed to her high-pressure job as a marketing executive at a start-up, which involved red eye flights and long hours.
After switching to a new gynecologist, at 48, she learned that these changes were related to her transition to menopause, known as perimenopause. And that the stress of the job was only making them worse. Ms. Chen says her doctor told her, "'your body is screaming for you to stop."'
"I hit a wall," Ms. Chen said.
Eventually, Ms. Chen changed her lifestyle and, after a few months, switched to working as a consultant, which allowed her to control her hours and stress levels.
Symptoms associated with the transition to menopause, which can last a decade, are often a drag on women's careers and arise at a time when they may be stepping into larger executive roles. A study by the Mayo Clinic published this year found that 15 percent of women either missed work or cut back on hours because of menopause symptoms, and that loss of productivity costs women an estimated $ 1.8 billion each year. Researchers in the U.K. also found that those who reported at least one disruptive menopausal symptom at age 50 were 43 percent more likely to have left their jobs by age 55.
And so, in the same way that many companies looking to attract and retain talent have expanded their benefits packages to include fertility treatments, paid parental leave programs and child care, some are now wrapping in menopause-specific care.
These benefits can include virtual access to the small pool of roughly 1,000 certified specialists in the country, who can be difficult to find locally, and coverage for often expensive hormone treatments that may not be included in some insurance plans.
For the health care company Sanofi, adding menopause perks were "a no-brainer," said Nathalie Grenache, its senior vice president of people and culture.
"If you feel truly supported throughout your life cycle, whether it is maternity or menopause, you'll be more engaged," she said. "I'm sure the new generation is more demanding on that."
Providers of corporate support services for menopause say uptake has been fast. Peppy, a gender-inclusive telehealth company that was founded in 2018 in Britain, offers menopause support in workplaces and began offering services in the U.S. in January. EBay, Nvidia, Wiley and Capgemini are all clients.In October, the health care benefits provider Maven launched a menopause product, which provides employees with app-based telehealth access to specialists and therapists as well as chat rooms to discuss their experiences and share resources. Within nine months, more than 150 companies had signed up, said Kate Ryder, its chief executive and founder. It has become "the fastest selling product," she added, "in the history of all Maven products."
More than 40 percent of female workers are at least 45, the age at which women typically transition to menopause (though some studies suggest that women of color might begin earlier). That shift -- marking the end of a woman's reproductive years -- is characterized by an array of symptoms, from insomnia to hot flashes and brain fog. In large part, the symptoms can be debilitating because there are few effective treatment options and there is very little research into why and how menopause changes the body.
Despite the high cost and common experience of menopause, it has mostly been ignored in the workplace. A 2023 survey by Bank of America found that 58 percent of women felt uncomfortable talking about menopause at work because it seemed too personal and because they worried they might be judged by co-workers.
But as more women enter senior leadership positions, that is changing, said Max Landry, the co-chief executive of Peppy. "The women who are going to go through menopause over the next five to 10 years are not going to accept this in a way that my mother's generation did," he said.
Some legal experts say existing laws may require companies to make accommodations for menopause, which could go beyond menopause-specific care benefits to include schedule flexibility or spaces for cooling down. These laws include the new Pregnant Workers Fairness Act that went into effect in June, said Liz Morris, the deputy director at the Center for WorkLife Law, an advocacy and research organization at the University of California College of the Law. That law mandates employers to provide accommodations for workers experiencing pregnancy, postpartum recovery and "related medical conditions," which, Ms. Morris argued, could include the end of fertility.
Regardless of whether that so far untested argument holds up in court, corporate benefits won't be enough, said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, the executive director of the New York University School of Law's Birnbaum Women's Leadership Center. She said that both further research that can help prevent symptoms in the first place and laws that explicitly ban discrimination are needed.
Corporate benefits, Ms. Weiss-Wolf said, are, at best, "just scratching at the surface."

Full text: Investors are pouring money into the less exclusive cousin of tennis.
As pickleball takes over the minds and courts of America, investors are pouncing on the opportunity to turn a favorite casual pickup game into a massive professional sport.
The Super Bowl champion Tom Brady invested in a pickleball expansion team alongside the tennis star Kim Clijsters in 2022. This year, Drake and Michael B. Jordan backed a Brooklyn team. Major League Pickleball, one of the sport's two professional leagues, which was co-founded by the Texas-based billionaire Steve Kuhn, has grown from one event and eight teams in its 2021 debut to six events and 24 teams.
But as pingpong and some e-sports leagues have demonstrated, even if a huge number of people like to play a sport, it's no guarantee that the masses will watch it. Can pickleball develop the television deals and star power of tennis and other more established sports?
Investors see opportunity in tennis's less exclusive cousin. While pickleball has been around for decades, the sport -- which, unlike tennis, requires little experience or athletic ability -- exploded during the pandemic. Participation in pickleball almost doubled in 2022, growing by 85.7 percent year-over-year and by 158.6 percent over three years, according to The Sports & Fitness Industry Association.
The sport's investors have been driven partly by a desire to get in early. As valuations for National Basketball Association and National Football League teams have leaped beyond the reach of even some billionaires, pickleball offers, by comparison, a more affordable opportunity. Valuations of pickleball teams reportedly range anywhere from $ 1 million to $ 10 million. The Washington Commanders just sold for $ 6 billion.
But those valuations are going up. "We may be getting close to a point where it's almost too late to get in to expect a realistic return on investment," said Patrick Rishe, the director of the sports business program at Washington University in St. Louis.
A lot hinges on television. "We don't know whether pickleball is going to be a television event -- if it's not, there probably won't be a lot of revenue attached to it," said David Levy, the former president of the television and media conglomerate Turner. "Sponsors want what? Reach and branding."
As a co-founder of Horizon Sports & Experiences, a sports and marketing agency, Mr. Levy this year launched the Pickleball Slam, an ESPN-broadcast event that featured retired the tennis pros Andre Agassi, John McEnroe and others competing for a million-dollar prize. It was viewed as a success, notching an average broadcast viewership of 237,000 adults under 50. But it borrowed its stars from another sport.
Pickleball proponents say the sport will eventually develop its own celebrity players.
But pickleball pessimists aren't so sure. "It doesn't make for good television," Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College who has written several books about sports, told DealBook. He pointed out that while pingpong has long been played by millions of people in multiple countries, it hasn't become a commercial success. "I think that pickleball is going to confront some of the same issues," he said.
Is there another way? "The viewership side of it -- people watching at home -- is going to be a challenge," said Richard Kleiman, a co-owner of a professional pickleball team, the Brooklyn Aces, and the founder of Boardroom, a sports and entertainment company that also invests in emerging sports teams and leagues. He said that rather than depending on big network T.V. deals, teams may make much of their profits from merchandise and events, like the U.S. Pickleball Nationals, which inked a sponsorship deal with the hospitality company Margaritaville last year.
Marc Lasry, the chief executive of the hedge fund Avenue Capital Group and one of sport's earliest big ticket investors, is taking a long-term view on television pickleball riches.
"TV rights are like steroids," he told DealBook. "Ultimately, the media rights will get there. The question is: is it a year from now or five years from now?"
Mr. Lasry, who sold his stake in the Milwaukee Bucks for $ 3.5 billion this year, noted the N.B.A. started with a three-year $ 1.5 million T.V. deal in 1979. It now wants a reported $ 75 billion for its rights when they come up for renewal.
Even if pickleball doesn't follow a similar trajectory, Mr. Lasry thinks the sport is a bet worth taking: "If you say to me, I got 50 million people playing pickleball, but you're never going to watch it on TV -- Would you still want to own a piece of that business?"
The answer, he said, is "yes." -- Lauren Hirsch
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Donald Trump is indicted in Georgia. The former president and 18 others face charges stemming from efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in the state. Trump, the Republican front-runner for president, has been charged in at least four separate criminal cases since April.
Environmental activists win in Montana. A judge found that the state's failure to consider the impact of warming temperatures when approving fossil fuel projects was unconstitutional. (The state is expected to appeal.) Similar cases seeking to hold oil giants and governments accountable for damages from climate disasters are winding their way through courts nationwide.
More signs of decline in China's economy. Retail sales and industrial production both missed forecasts in July, according to data released on Tuesday, and Beijing said it would stop publishing youth unemployment figures weeks after it hit a record high. The I.M.F. has previously forecast that China would account for 35 percent of global growth this year, but that's looking less likely.
The next frontier for corporate benefits: Menopause
In the same way that many companies looking to attract and retain talent have expanded their benefits packages to include fertility treatments and paid parental leave, many are now wrapping in menopause-specific care.
Doing so was a "no brainer," said Nathalie Grenache, the senior vice president of people and culture at the health care company Sanofi, which began offering such menopause benefits to employees in October.
"If you feel truly supported throughout your life cycle, whether it is maternity or menopause, you'll be more engaged," she said.
Symptoms associated with the transition to menopause, which can last a decade, are often a drag on women's careers. A study by the Mayo Clinic found that 15 percent of women either missed work or cut back on hours because of menopause symptoms, and that loss of productivity costs women an estimated $ 1.8 billion each year. Researchers in the U.K. also found that those who reported at least one disruptive menopausal symptom at age 50 were 43 percent more likely to have left their jobs by age 55.
Corporate benefits that address menopause can include virtual access to the small pool of roughly 1,000 certified specialists in the country, who can be difficult to find locally, and coverage of often expensive hormone treatment, which may not be included in some insurance plans.
Providers of menopause support services say uptake has been fast. Peppy, a gender-inclusive telehealth company founded in 2018 in Britain, offers menopause support in workplaces and began offering services in the U.S. in January. EBay, Nvidia, Wiley and Capgemini are all clients. In October, the health care benefits provider Maven launched a menopause product, which provides employees with app-based telehealth access to specialists and therapists. Within nine months, more than 150 companies had signed up, said Kate Ryder, its chief executive and founder. It has become "the fastest selling product," she added, "in the history of all Maven products."
More than 40 percent of female workers are at least 45, the age at which women typically transition to menopause (though some studies suggest women of color might begin earlier). But despite the high cost and common experience of menopause, it has mostly been ignored in the workplace. A 2023 survey by Bank of America found that 58 percent of women felt uncomfortable talking about menopause at work.
Existing laws may require companies to make accommodations beyond benefits. Liz Morris, the deputy director at the Center for WorkLife Law, an advocacy and research organization at the University of California College of the Law, argues that a patchwork of laws could be used to cover for menopause symptoms. They include the new Pregnant Workers Fairness Act that went into effect in June. It mandates employers provide accommodations for workers experiencing pregnancy, postpartum recovery and "related medical conditions," which, Morris argued, could include the end of fertility.
Regardless of whether the so far untested argument holds up in court, Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, who runs the women's leadership center at the New York University School of Law, says corporate benefits won't be enough: Both further research that can help prevent symptoms and laws that explicitly ban discrimination are needed.
Corporate benefits, Weiss-Wolf said, are, at best, "just scratching at the surface."
Saudi Arabia's winning streak in sports
Saudi Arabia lured its biggest soccer star in a summer of big signings this week: the Brazilian player Neymar joined the Al Hilal team from Qatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain on a contract that will reportedly pay him $ 165 million a year.
The focus on the kingdom's sports spending in recent months has been on a tentative peace deal between the PGA Tour and its rival, the Saudi-backed LIV Golf. But Neymar's signing was a reminder that Riyadh's push to diversify began with the world's most popular sport. And lessons from its first big sports acquisition could offer clues to what happens next elsewhere.
Buying Newcastle United was the start of a global push. A consortium led by the Public Investment Fund, Saudi's sovereign wealth fund, bought the English Premier League team in 2021 from a British retail tycoon for about $ 370 million. But the deal was contentious, coming just three years after Saudi agents murdered the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Success on the pitch helped dampen difficult questions. As the team has been transformed into one of the country's best,questions about "sportswashing" have become less frequent, in what some have called a "deafening silence." (This week, it was revealed that the British government invited Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler, for an official visit.)
Saudi money is now being used to supercharge its domestic league. The signing last year of Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portuguese player considered one of the sport's best ever, seemed an anomaly. But the league created a huge fund potentially worth more than $ 1 billion to pick off stars from Europe's top leagues. Teams spent about $ 500 million this summer alone. (Even Saudi fans are spending big: Fabinho, a Brazilian player who was signed from Liverpool, was given a Rolex by an enthusiastic supporter after his first match for Al-Ittihad last week.)
What next for Saudi's global sports push? The P.I.F. is spending billions on everything from boxing to Formula One motor racing. It has held talks with the men's ATP tennis tour about investments. Improbably, it will host the Asian Winter Games in 2029 and is also expected to bid for the soccer World Cup.
In Washington, calls persist for Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the head of the P.I.F., to testify before a Senate committee about the putative PGA-LIV deal .
As for Newcastle, the team said on Thursday that the Saudi men's national team would play two matches in September at St. James' Park, its home ground. Saudi's sports push is about to come full circle.
Quiz time, global stock markets edition
Despite a shaky August performance, stocks have had a strong year. Most of those gains came from the roughly $ 10 trillion global rally in the first half of 2023. What makes that surge all the more impressive is that inflation and geopolitical instability are crimping economic growth worldwide.
Which of the following is the best-performing stock index this year?
The Nasdaq composite (U.S.)
The BUSE Merval index (Argentina)
Nikkei 225 (Japan)
Hang Seng (China)
Answer: Argentina's Merval index. It's jumped nearly threefold since the start of the year (in local currency terms) as of Thursday's close, and is up more than 45 percent in U.S. dollar terms, an extraordinary rise considering the country's debt woes, inflation running above 100 percent and stalled growth. Over the same period, the Nasdaq was up roughly 27 percent, according to Refinitiv data.

Full text: Fans are rushing to collect all 13 of the Brooklyn Public Library's limited-edition cards, which feature imagery from each of the rapper's solo albums.
Patrons streamed toward the returns desk at the Brooklyn Public Library's main branch on Friday afternoon, buzzing with excitement. Several posed for pictures in the building's lobby, which was newly plastered with images of Jay-Z, then signed up for special library cards that feature artwork from the rapper's albums.
The limited-edition library cards are the marquee souvenir from "The Book of Hov," an exhibition honoring Jay-Z that took over the library last month.
The cards are free for New York State residents and are available at Brooklyn Public Library branches in 13 different designs, each featuring the cover art from one of Jay-Z's solo albums. Fans, who see the cards as instantly classic pieces of hip-hop memorabilia, are tracking them down with the sort of fervor usually reserved for vinyl records or concert tees.
"Jay-Z being a Brooklyn native, he goes hard for Brooklyn, and his fans go hard for him," said Chaz Barracks, 35, an artist and postdoctoral fellow at Syracuse University. He had taken a five-hour bus ride to Brooklyn to visit the library. "The card was worth it," he added.
According to the library, 11,000 new accounts have been created with associated Jay-Z cards. Branches that offered the limited-edition cards recorded a more than 1,000 percent increase in registrations in the last two weeks of July over the same period in June.
Linda E. Johnson, the Brooklyn Public Library's chief executive, said she had proposed a limited-edition card early in the library's conversations with Roc Nation, Jay-Z's entertainment company, which created the exhibition. The library had previously released cards featuring the work of Maurice Sendak, the author and illustrator of "Where the Wild Things Are."
"Swag in the form of T-shirts or mugs, that's not really what we're about," Ms. Johnson said. "The card is your ticket to everything we have."
Roc Nation came back with the suggestion that they make 13 cards instead. The library decided to allow patrons to collect one of each style, but to rotate different card designs through many of the library's branches to encourage fans to visit several locations.
That plan appears to have worked, with some Brooklyn residents rushing out to collect the set of cards "like Pokémon," as one social media user described it. Olayinka Martins, 26, a writer living in Brooklyn, spent three days visiting nine different branches in order to collect all 13.
Mr. Martins, who learned to read through the Brooklyn library system, said he thought it was smart to plug into the hype cycle that exists around hip-hop merchandise. "The library leadership understands that hip-hop and Black culture have been the site of cool, and cool sells," he said. "It's very savvy."
The cards have caught the attention of Jay-Z fans outside the state, who cannot register for them because they lack New York addresses. Online, some are begging New Yorkers to mail them the cards. Complete sets are listed on eBay for upward of $ 1,000.
Mr. Martins did not collect the cards planning to sell them, but he said he had been tempted by offers of more than $ 700.
Ms. Johnson said the library had not been surprised to learn that people were trying to resell the cards. "We wish they weren't doing it," she said, "but it's a small enough number that we're not so worried right now."
The Brooklyn Public Library is just one of several New York City institutions recognizing the 50th anniversary of hip-hop, which had its origins in the South Bronx. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has released four MetroCards honoring LL Cool J, Pop Smoke, Rakim and Cam'ron, which are being sold near each of the artists' birthplaces. And the New York Public Library, which has locations in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island, has released a special-edition card featuring imagery from the cassette that accompanied the 1983 film "Wild Style."
Brooklyn residents have been especially excited by the Jay-Z exhibition, which traces the artist's life from his childhood in the Marcy Houses, a public housing complex in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, to his career as a musician and mogul.
Olivia Shalhoup, 26, who runs a digital marketing agency and lives in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, said she found out about the exhibition on social media. She described herself as "a massive Hov fan" who has a "Vol. 3 ... Life and Times of S. Carter" rug in her apartment.
The Jay-Z card she picked up a few days later is the first physical library card she has owned. "Seeing a rapper be on something as mainstream and as massive as a library card, it's just phenomenal," she said.
Dr. Barracks felt similarly. While waiting in a 20-minute line for his card, he said he had heard fans "bro-ing out" about which album was superior.
"We don't always see Black stories like Jay-Z's take over everyday public spaces," said Dr. Barracks, whose research centers on Black joy. "Every time people go to get other books, maybe it'll encourage them to remember that our stories exist in the library, too."

A Zoom Meeting, Fake Names And an A.I. Demo Gone Awry: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A.I. start-ups are competing fiercely with one another as a race to get ahead in the technology intensifies.
Arthur AI, an artificial intelligence company in New York, received a message in April last year from a start-up called OneOneThree. Yan Fung, OneOneThree's head of technology, said he was interested in buying Arthur AI's technology and wanted a demonstration.
A week later, Arthur AI held a Zoom meeting with Mr. Fung to show him its software, according to emails and a video recording viewed by The New York Times. When Mr. Fung's colleague joined the call, the Arthur AI team realized something was off.
Mr. Fung said Karina Patel, OneOneThree's "main engineer," would dial in. But the name that flashed up in the Zoom call was Aparna Dhinakaran. An Arthur AI employee recognized the name as belonging to a founder of Arize AI, a rival start-up. "That's so strange -- I don't know how they could have possibly gotten the link," the Arthur AI employee said.
The new attendee quickly logged off, and Mr. Fung said he did not know Ms. Dhinakaran.
Arthur AI later surmised from online photos that Mr. Fung was an employee of ArizeAI named Dat Ngo, a person with knowledge of the situation said. OneOneThree appeared to be an inactive company of his.
The world of A.I. has become increasingly competitive as big tech companies and start-ups fight for customers, talent, funding and publicity. As a race over the technology heats up, large companies have raided universities for engineers while some of their top talent have left to start their own A.I. companies. In recent months, venture capitalists have also dueled ferociously to invest in A.I. start-ups by dangling large sums at soaring valuations.
The jockeying among A.I. start-ups is particularly intense. Only the ones that strike the right partnerships, land the biggest customers and generate the most buzz have a chance at riding the wave of hype to success.
When A.I. has attracted interest in the past, some companies have overpromised what they can do. A 2019 study by MMC, a London-based venture capital firm, found that 40 percent of 2,830 European start-ups that were classified as A.I. companies did not use A.I. technology for any material business reason.
"We know people would do crazy things to get ahead," said Olivier Toubia, a professor of behavioral economics and entrepreneurship at Columbia Business School. He said the tech industry's history of cutthroat competition, especially during times of frenzied investment and opportunity, went back to the late-1990s dot-com boom.
Many businesses track their rivals, and tech start-ups are known for using aggressive and unconventional tactics to grow as quickly as possible. But most draw a line at behavior like using a false identity or another company's name to pose as a customer.
Arthur AI's chief executive and an Arize AI spokesman declined to comment. Ms. Dhinakaran and Mr. Ngo did not respond to requests for comment.
Arize AI and Arthur AI both offer "observability" software, which helps companies monitor and solve problems with A.I. models. Customers would most likely compare the offerings and choose one.
Ms. Dhinakaran started Arize AI in 2020 in the San Francisco Bay Area with Jason Lopatecki, a former executive at TubeMogul, an advertising technology company. The start-up has raised $ 61 million from investors including Battery Ventures, Foundation Capital, TCV and Trinity Ventures, valuing it at $ 155 million, according to PitchBook, which tracks start-ups.
In a 2022 presentation, Arize AI listed Uber, eBay and Instacart as customers. The presentation ended with an A.I.-generated image of the company's hypothetical initial public offering.
Ms. Dhinakaran, 29, is active in the A.I. start-up scene. She speaks at industry events and writes a column about A.I. for Forbes, which has listed her as a 30 under 30 honoree, an award for successful young people in business. She promotes her experience as "an ML engineer and leader" at Uber, where she worked for three years, and at Apple and TubeMogul, where she was an intern.
In 2020, Ms. Dhinakaran competed in the reality television show "The Amazing Race" with her brother. They finished fifth.
"I'm passionate about making A.I. successful, fair and transparent," she wrote in a biography for the show. She added that she was a foodie who enjoyed trying new cuisines, with other favorite hobbies including tennis and "hosting board game nights that involve lying."
On LinkedIn, Mr. Ngo is listed as a founder of the OneOneThree Project, which was described as a research provider for autonomous vehicle networks, from June 2020 to July 2021. During that time, he worked as a data scientist at the software company Point Predictive and the tax consulting firm Alliantgroup, according to his LinkedIn profile. He joined Arize AI in January 2022.
Mr. Ngo registered a business called OneOneThree in Delaware in April 2021, a year before the Arthur AI meeting and eight months before he started working at Arize AI, according to corporate filings. OneOneThree had no website at the time of the meeting and lists two former employees, including Mr. Ngo, on LinkedIn. OneOneThree's registration has not been active since March, according to a filing and a representative for the Delaware secretary of state.
OneOneThree has also appeared in a customer contact list for WhyLabs, another A.I. start-up that competes with Arize, indicating that OneOneThree signed up for a demonstration or attended an event hosted by WhyLabs, the person with knowledge of the situation said. On the call with Arthur AI, Mr. Ngo, appearing as Mr. Fung, said that OneOneThree had looked at WhyLabs's software and liked some aspects of it, but that "it didn't go deep enough for me."
Before that Zoom meeting last year between Arthur AI and OneOneThree, the person calling himself Mr. Fung explained that OneOneThree was in "stealth mode," which is why it had no website, the person with knowledge of the situation said.
Arthur AI asked Mr. Fung to sign a mutual nondisclosure agreement, which is common among tech companies to protect trade secrets. He asked Arthur AI to "hold off on the NDA," according to messages viewed by The Times. The company agreed.
During the call, Mr. Ngo answered Arthur AI's questions about OneOneThree, according to the video recording of the meeting. Then he said his colleague Ms. Patel would join.
That was when Ms. Dhinakaran's name came up onscreen, before quickly logging off. The meeting went silent. An Arthur AI employee asked Mr. Ngo if he knew Ms. Dhinakaran and why a competing start-up's founder would try to see the demonstration, according to the recording.
"Nope, shouldn't be anyone I know," he replied.
Shortly after the call, an Arthur AI employee confronted Mr. Ngo in a LinkedIn message, a person with knowledge of the exchange said. Mr. Ngo responded by trying to recruit the Arthur AI employee to Arize AI, the person said.

The world of AI has become increasingly competitive as big tech companies and startups fight for customers, talent, funding and publicity. As a race over the technology heats up, large companies have raided universities for engineers while some of their top talent have left to start their own AI companies. In recent months, venture capitalists have also dueled ferociously to invest in AI startups by dangling large sums at soaring valuations.
The jockeying among AI startups is particularly intense. Only the ones that strike the right partnerships, land the biggest customers and generate the most buzz have a chance at riding the wave of hype to success.
When AI has attracted interest in the past, some companies have overpromised what they can do. A 2019 study by MMC, a London-based venture capital firm, found that 40% of 2,830 European startups that were classified as AI companies did not use AI technology for any material business reason.
“We know people would do crazy things to get ahead,” said Olivier Toubia, a professor of behavioral economics and entrepreneurship at Columbia Business School. He said the tech industry’s history of cutthroat competition, especially during times of frenzied investment and opportunity, went back to the late-1990s dot-com boom.
Many businesses track their rivals, and tech startups are known for using aggressive and unconventional tactics to grow as quickly as possible. But most draw a line at behavior like using a false identity or another company’s name to pose as a customer.
Arthur AI’s CEO and an Arize AI spokesperson declined to comment. Dhinakaran and Ngo did not respond to requests for comment.
Arize AI and Arthur AI both offer “observability” software, which helps companies monitor and solve problems with AI models. Customers would most likely compare the offerings and choose one.
Dhinakaran started Arize AI in 2020 in the San Francisco Bay Area with Jason Lopatecki, a former executive at TubeMogul, an advertising technology company. The startup has raised $61 million from investors including Battery Ventures, Foundation Capital, TCV and Trinity Ventures, valuing it at $155 million, according to PitchBook, which tracks startups.
In a 2022 presentation, Arize AI listed Uber, eBay and Instacart as customers. The presentation ended with an AI-generated image of the company’s hypothetical initial public offering.
Dhinakaran, 29, is active in the AI startup scene. She speaks at industry events and writes a column about AI for Forbes, which has listed her as a 30 under 30 honoree, an award for successful young people in business. She promotes her experience as “an ML engineer and leader” at Uber, where she worked for three years, and at Apple and TubeMogul, where she was an intern.
In 2020, Dhinakaran competed in the reality television show “The Amazing Race” with her brother. They finished fifth.
“I’m passionate about making AI successful, fair and transparent,” she wrote in a biography for the show. She added that she was a foodie who enjoyed trying new cuisines, with other favorite hobbies including tennis and “hosting board game nights that involve lying.”
On LinkedIn, Ngo is listed as a founder of the OneOneThree Project, which was described as a research provider for autonomous vehicle networks, from June 2020 to July 2021. During that time, he worked as a data scientist at the software company Point Predictive and the tax consulting firm Alliantgroup, according to his LinkedIn profile. He joined Arize AI in January 2022.
Ngo registered a business called OneOneThree in Delaware in April 2021, a year before the Arthur AI meeting and eight months before he started working at Arize AI, according to corporate filings. OneOneThree had no website at the time of the meeting and lists two former employees, including Ngo, on LinkedIn. OneOneThree’s registration has not been active since March, according to a filing and a representative for the Delaware secretary of state.
OneOneThree has also appeared in a customer contact list for WhyLabs, another AI startup that competes with Arize, indicating that OneOneThree signed up for a demonstration or attended an event hosted by WhyLabs, the person with knowledge of the situation said. On the call with Arthur AI, Ngo, appearing as Fung, said that OneOneThree had looked at WhyLabs’ software and liked some aspects of it, but that “it didn’t go deep enough for me.”
Before that Zoom meeting last year between Arthur AI and OneOneThree, the person calling himself Fung explained that OneOneThree was in “stealth mode,” which is why it had no website, the person with knowledge of the situation said.
Arthur AI asked Fung to sign a mutual nondisclosure agreement, which is common among tech companies to protect trade secrets. He asked Arthur AI to “hold off on the NDA,” according to messages viewed by the Times. The company agreed.
During the call, Ngo answered Arthur AI’s questions about OneOneThree, according to the video recording of the meeting. Then he said his colleague Patel would join.
That was when Dhinakaran’s name came up on screen, before quickly logging off. The meeting went silent. An Arthur AI employee asked Ngo if he knew Dhinakaran and why a competing startup’s founder would try to see the demonstration, according to the recording.
“Nope, shouldn’t be anyone I know,” he replied.
Shortly after the call, an Arthur AI employee confronted Ngo in a LinkedIn message, a person with knowledge of the exchange said. Ngo responded by trying to recruit the Arthur AI employee to Arize AI, the person said.

Full text: Elon Musk is known for Tesla, his pioneering electric vehicle company, and his bumpy acquisition of Twitter, rechristened as the social media company X. But he is also a leading industrialist in the skies. Since Mr. Musk's private rocket fleet, SpaceX, has sent some 4,500 satellites into orbit. Using Mr. Musk's Starlink technology, the satellites communicate with terminals on Earth to beam high-speed internet around the world.
Adam Satariano is one of the journalists behind a recent Times article about Starlink's growth and influence. He joined "The Daily" podcast to explain his reporting. Here is an edited excerpt from his conversation with the host, Sabrina Tavernise.
So Adam, tell us where this reporting that you've done on Starlink started for you.
Part of it is just geeky curiosity. I learned about this technology, which is essentially satellites orbiting the Earth beaming an internet connection down to just about anywhere. It seems like this amazing technology, particularly when you think of all the parts of the Earth that don't have internet connection. Then you add in the fact that it's controlled by Elon Musk.
So a group of colleagues and I wanted to understand the scale of this. We found a database managed by a researcher in Hawaii. There are more than 8,000 active satellites spinning around the Earth right now. And more than half of those are controlled by Elon Musk and his company.
So one company is responsible for 50 percent of the satellites in space.
Exactly, and the more you learn about it, you start to see the geopolitical consequences and other important ways in which this technology can be influencing the world.
Let's start at how he came to dominate so much of the sky around the planet. Where does that story start?
This starts more than 20 years ago. And we need to rewind a bit and remember that Elon Musk is not the person that we know now at this period of time. He was part of a group called the PayPal Mafia, who built up PayPal, the payments company, which eventually sold to eBay for a great deal of money. So that's the initial source of his wealth.
But he is also fascinated by space, and ideas of being an interplanetary species, and colonizing Mars. I spoke to one British engineer named Martin Sweeting who got together with Musk in 2001.
What Sweeting and his company, Surrey Technology, were quite good at was developing smaller satellites. Instead of big, hulking satellites the size of a bus that get launched far into space, these were much smaller satellites, which are less expensive to develop. And they can sit in low-Earth orbit, which is closer to the planet.
When did the idea for Starlink come into focus?
We don't know exactly when he hatched this grand plan. Other companies in the 1990s and in the 2000s had tried satellite internet, but almost all of them went bust. It is incredibly expensive to launch a satellite into space. And to make this work, you need lots of them.
And at this point, what was he aiming for? What was the business strategy?
Elon Musk says the opportunity is massive. If they get something like 3 percent of the overall global internet market, that would be at least $ 30 billion a year.
To make this work, you need a lot of satellites. And launching them is expensive. So how did he solve this cost problem?
Well, it was never a foregone conclusion that he would. But he had this advantage that he could lean into, which is around the same time he's talking to Martin Sweeting, Musk founds a company called SpaceX, in 2002.
This was a private space fleet, but the a company that almost put him into bankruptcy. And this is around the time when Tesla was also struggling. So this is a period when Musk is not assuredly going to be on the sort of billionaire list that he is today. But eventually, by late 2015, early 2016, SpaceX has a major breakthrough.
And that breakthrough is that their rockets could land back on Earth and be reusable. Most rockets, they go into space, and when they come back, disintegrate. But here, they could come back and land, and eventually be reused.
So if you are creating a satellite internet company where you need hundreds, thousands of these things put up into orbit, this is a key advantage. You essentially have an express train to take up these satellites, release them in orbit, come back down and eventually do it again.
This is the solution to the cost problem of needing to send so many satellites up into space, right?
He's able to do it at a scale that's the envy of others who have long tried to do the same. And in 2019 they launched their first 60 or so satellites into orbit. Now, they're up to more than 4,500, and they have more than 1.5 million customers.
SpaceX launched Starlink satellites from Kennedy Space Center in Florida last May. The company has more than 4,500 satellites in space. (PHOTOGRAPH BY MALCOLM DENEMARK/FLORIDA TODAY, VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS) This article appeared in print on page A2.

She's Been a Movie Star for Decades: [Correction]

Full text: Before Margot Robbie's live-action take on the doll, Mattel put out more than a dozen animated films that have an avid following, even now.
Every Christmas season starting when I was 5, my sister and I had a go-to movie: "Barbie in the Nutcracker."
We'd pop in the VHS tape and watch Barbie as Clara dance the night away with the Nutcracker on a journey to find the Sugarplum Princess and defeat the Mouse King. We cheered as she landed her prince and consoled each other when she lost him again.
It was just the tip of our fandom for the animated Barbie films that Mattel began releasing at a rate of around one per year beginning with "Nutcracker" in 2001 and eventually totaling about 40 films. Our affection came to encompass VHS tapes of the first five princess movies, as well as my "Barbie of Swan Lake" eighth birthday party with an Odette ice cream cake and pink paper-swan tiaras (which my 70-something grandfather gamely donned).
Though Greta Gerwig's new live-action "Barbie," which just crossed $ 1 billion at the box office, has been a smash, attracting reams of pink-clad moviegoers to cheer Kate McKinnon's Weird Barbie and lust after Ken's tie-dye "I Am Kenough" hoodie, it's hardly the first beloved movie to feature the doll, as my sister and I well knew. But until recently, I thought the hold the animated films had on us was unique.
And then I learned that there's a whole generation obsessed with them, drawn perhaps by nostalgia for a simpler time of sparkly princess gowns, beautiful music and, despite a few obstacles, happy endings for Barbie and her friends.
On college campuses across the country, 20-somethings host watch parties, mainlining hours at a time of the 90-minute animated adventures, the earliest of which feature classical scores played by illustrious outfits like the London Symphony Orchestra and star villains voiced by name actors like Martin Short (the traitorous Preminger in "The Princess and the Pauper") and Tim Curry (a conniving Mouse King).
There are dozens of TikTok accounts devoted to clips from the movies. On eBay, play sets associated with the earlier films -- like the royal music palace from "Princess and the Pauper" -- can command upward of $ 1,000.
"There's so much positivity in the movies, friendship, and love, that people can't not love them," said Hannah, a 26-year-old Barbie cosplayer in Neuberg, Germany. (The New York Times agreed to identify her only by her first name because of privacy concerns.) Since 2016, she has run a popular Instagram account in which she posts photos of herself dressed up as the franchise's heroines, like Odette, Rapunzel and Clara. ("Nutcracker" is her favorite film.)
One reason she is so drawn to the early animated films, Hannah said, is the gorgeous backdrops and the fabulous fairy-tale wardrobe.
"At first, my idea of making a Barbie ball gown for myself caused a lot of people around me to shake their heads and laugh," she said. But she wanted to show them "that I could be whatever I wanted."
Even, she added, a princess.
The success of the animated films, at first glance, is not obvious: The one regarded as the best, "The Princess and the Pauper," sits at just 75 percent fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Critics have been lukewarm, with The New York Times calling "Barbie in the Nutcracker," the first installment, a "pallid but likable" tale for "very small children." Aspects like the greedy, hooknosed villain of "Swan Lake" have not aged well, provoking criticism for antisemitic tropes.
The problems are painfully obvious to me now. But, on a recent rewatch, I also saw what had initially engrossed me and my sister: Barbie is incorruptible, resistant to the human forces of temptation, pride, selfishness. By the rules of fairy-tale logic -- good things happen to good people -- her happy ending is a foregone conclusion.
Kelly Sheridan, the Canadian actress who voiced Barbie in 28 of the films between 2001 and 2015, said the initial mantra for the Barbie character was "kind, clever, brave."
"Barbie was flawless," Sheridan, 46, said in a recent phone conversation from her home in Vancouver, British Columbia. "She could do no wrong."
For instance, in "Nutcracker," the script initially had Barbie as Clara stumbling when she carried a tray and catching herself before spilling it contents. But a meeting of the film's producers and Mattel representatives led to a change because, Sheridan said, "Barbie would never stumble."
Another time, when she was recording the scene in which Clara confronts the Mouse King, a Mattel representative asked if Barbie could sound less angry. "Because Barbie would never be angry, even confronting the villain," she said. "She was always kind, clever and brave."
The reins had loosened, she said, by the 16th film, "Barbie and the Three Musketeers," in which an athletic, ambitious Barbie engages in sword fights. The studio, she said, realized people actually wanted to relate to her.
"She was able to be more silly and goofy and to have more comedic moments," she said.
By the career-focused titles of the mid-2010s, Barbie had shed her princess gowns for pants. Now, she was exploring space, going on spy missions and designing video games.
The artist known as Purcy, a 22-year-old illustrator who on Instagram posts her work picturing Barbie as various characters from the animated films, has seen 33 of the films. (She also asked not to use her full name for privacy reasons.) The ones she rewatches the most are set in the modern day, like her favorite, "Barbie: Princess Charm School."
The Barbie of those films, she said, "showed us that we can be kind, caring, feel love, love pink, while also be strong and standing up for ourselves."
For Hannah, the best Barbie animated films will always be the original princess tales.
Whenever she attends a cosplay event or posts a photo of her costumes on Instagram, she said, both men and women approach her to share childhood memories they associate with the movies and the dolls.
"Barbie connects us," she said.

A Cautionary Tale From Venmo: Your Sensitive Data Is Out There: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The mobile wallet service is a cautionary tale of how apps born at least a decade ago may be exposing more information than you would like.
There's an app for snooping on your friends, family and colleagues to find out about their fancy dinners, the people they are dating and the parties they are attending that you weren't invited to.
It's not a social networking app like Facebook or Snapchat. It's Venmo, the app that became popular more than a decade ago by enabling people to send mobile payments to one another and to post those transactions, often in the form of cute emojis, on a public timeline.
The snooping works the other way around, too. Even if you seldom use Venmo today, the app is most likely leaking sensitive information about you to the general public.
How do I know? I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I recently discovered that my contacts list, which includes the names of people in my phone book, was published on Venmo for anyone using the app to see.
That's because more than a decade ago, Venmo made people's contact lists visible to its users. It created an option to hide the address book only two years ago, long after I had stopped using the app.
Venmo is a strong example of how even as social norms shift on the ways we use technology, the companies and their apps don't change much. Venmo was founded in 2009 as a music start-up that let users buy songs from bands through a text message. By the time eBay acquired it in 2013, it had become a mobile wallet service that was trendy among younger people who were gung-ho about sharing information about themselves online.
At the time, social networking was novel, and posting your thoughts, movements and achievements for everyone to know about was cutting edge, not sinister. Since then, we have learned the hard way that sharing such seemingly innocuous information can be hazardous. Stalkers, employers or data brokers can use the data to study our whereabouts and activities to target us.
But Venmo remains an app with a strong social networking element, one of many in a generation of apps that are now nearly 15 years old. And if you have apps and internet accounts from then that are on autopilot, it's best to revisit them periodically to check their settings so that you can safeguard your privacy. If you no longer find value in the service, the safest bet may be to delete the account.
Before we get into that, let's dive into why Venmo remains a privacy concern and what to do to protect your data.
Venmo Transactions
In the early 2010s, as smartphones became popular, Venmo rode the coattails of companies like Facebook and Twitter, which brought the concept of a public timeline into the mainstream. Similar to those networks, Venmo allowed people to publicly post to a feed, in its case details of payment transactions, including the dollar amount, time, date and a description, such as a pizza or taxicab emoji.
At the time, Braintree, the payments company that bought Venmo in 2012 before it was purchased by eBay, said Venmo had created "rave-worthy experiences" to simplify mobile payments between smartphone users. (Venmo is now owned by PayPal, which was spun off from eBay in 2015.)
Venmo has made some changes over the years to protect its users' privacy. In 2021, it disabled its global feed, a stream where users could see Venmo transactions among strangers.
But critics say the app still falls short. Today, you can see transactions among people who are not your friends if you visit their profiles.
Venmo is still set by default to publicly share when you receive or make a payment. There's an option to make the transaction private, but if you use the app quickly and don't notice the setting, you could unknowingly broadcast the payments between you and others.
"It's not just that I went out to pizza with this person," said Gennie Gebhart, a managing director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit. "It's a pattern of who you live with, interact with and do business with, and how it changes over time."
Last month, The Guardian discovered through a Venmo feed that an aide for Justice Clarence Thomas was taking payments from lawyers who have had business with the Supreme Court, a potential conflict of interest. The aide has since hidden his Venmo activity from public view.
While the idea of posting pizza and beer emojis and dollar amounts could sound like a fun way to tell others that you are out and about, there may eventually be consequences. Those transactions could be used to study your movements or, in the case of Justice Thomas, inadvertently disclose relationships.
In 2017, Hang Do Thi Duc, a data researcher who was at the Mozilla Foundation, published Public by Default, an interactive graphic summarizing the intimate details scraped from 208 million Venmo transactions. The graphic homed in on the daily lives of several Venmo users, including a cannabis dealer, a food cart vendor and a married couple splitting bills and paying off a loan together.
Venmo said in a statement that it had worked to change its privacy measures for customers and that privacy settings could be controlled within its app. "The privacy and safety of all Venmo users is always a top priority," the company said.
To prevent your day-to-day life from being broadcast on Venmo, make sure to change the settings. Inside the app, click on the Me tab, tap the settings icon and select Privacy. Under default privacy settings, select Private. Then, under the "More" section in Privacy, click "Past Transactions" and make sure to set that to "Change All to Private."
Your Contacts List
Venmo has made the contacts list, which can be generated from your smartphone's address book or your Facebook friends list, viewable to any other user on the app.
That can make a lot of information public. In 2021, my colleague Ryan Mac, who was then at BuzzFeed News, used Venmo to discover President Biden's account and personal contacts list. Mr. Biden later deleted his Venmo account.
On a personal level, a public address book can reveal a new romantic partner to an ex. For professionals, it could expose a doctor's patients, a journalist's sources or a salesperson's clients.
To hide your contacts list from public view, visit the privacy settings, click on Friends List and select Private. Also, toggle off the option for "appear in other users' friends lists."
Review, Then Review Again
All tech companies change their data-sharing features and settings over time. So take a moment to scroll through your phone and review the settings inside apps you haven't used in a while to see if there's something you missed.
Ms. Do Thi Duc, who is now a graphics editor at The New York Times, said she wasn't surprised that Venmo was still making headlines, because the app relied on people's public oversharing as a marketing mechanism. She said she deleted her Venmo account when conducting her research on the company.
After writing this column, I did the same.

The snooping works the other way around, too. Even if you seldom use Venmo today, the app is most likely leaking sensitive information about you to the general public.
How do I know? I’m embarrassed to admit it, but I recently discovered that my contacts list, which includes the names of people in my phone book, was published on Venmo for anyone using the app to see.
That’s because more than a decade ago, Venmo made people’s contact lists visible to its users. It created an option to hide the address book only two years ago, long after I had stopped using the app.
Venmo is a strong example of how even as social norms shift on the ways we use technology, the companies and their apps don’t change much. Venmo was founded in 2009 as a music startup that let users buy songs from bands through a text message. By the time eBay acquired it in 2013, it had become a mobile wallet service that was trendy among younger people who were gung-ho about sharing information about themselves online.
At the time, social networking was novel, and posting your thoughts, movements and achievements for everyone to know about was cutting edge, not sinister. Since then, we have learned the hard way that sharing such seemingly innocuous information can be hazardous. Stalkers, employers or data brokers can use the data to study our whereabouts and activities to target us.
But Venmo remains an app with a strong social networking element, one of many in a generation of apps that are now nearly 15 years old. And if you have apps and internet accounts from then that are on autopilot, it’s best to revisit them periodically to check their settings so that you can safeguard your privacy. If you no longer find value in the service, the safest bet may be to delete the account.
Before we get into that, let’s dive into why Venmo remains a privacy concern and what to do to protect your data.
Venmo Transactions
In the early 2010s, as smartphones became popular, Venmo rode the coattails of companies like Facebook and Twitter, which brought the concept of a public timeline into the mainstream. Similar to those networks, Venmo allowed people to publicly post to a feed, in its case details of payment transactions, including the dollar amount, time, date and a description, such as a pizza or taxicab emoji.
At the time, Braintree, the payments company that bought Venmo in 2012 before it was purchased by eBay, said Venmo had created “rave-worthy experiences” to simplify mobile payments between smartphone users. (Venmo is now owned by PayPal, which was spun off from eBay in 2015.)
Venmo has made some changes over the years to protects its users’ privacy. In 2021, it disabled its global feed, a stream where users could see Venmo transactions among strangers.
But critics say the app still falls short. Today, you can see transactions among people who are not your friends if you visit their profiles.
Venmo is still set by default to publicly share when you receive or make a payment. There’s an option to make the transaction private, but if you use the app quickly and don’t notice the setting, you could unknowingly broadcast the payments between you and others.
“It’s not just that I went out to pizza with this person,” said Gennie Gebhart, a managing director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit. “It’s a pattern of who you live with, interact with and do business with, and how it changes over time.”
Last month, The Guardian discovered through a Venmo feed that an aide for Justice Clarence Thomas was taking payments from lawyers who have had business with the Supreme Court, a potential conflict of interest. The aide has since hidden his Venmo activity from public view.
While the idea of posting pizza and beer emoji and dollar amounts could sound like a fun way to tell others that you are out and about, there may eventually be consequences. Those transactions could be used to study your movements or, in the case of the Supreme Court aide, inadvertently disclose relationships.
In 2017, Hang Do Thi Duc, a data researcher who was at the Mozilla Foundation , published Public by Default, an interactive graphic summarizing the intimate details scraped from 208 million Venmo transactions. The graphic homed in on the daily lives of several Venmo users, including a cannabis dealer, a food cart vendor and a married couple splitting bills and paying off a loan together.
Venmo said in a statement that it had worked to change its privacy measures for customers and that privacy settings could be controlled within its app. “The privacyand safety of allVenmousers is always a top priority,” the company said.
To prevent your day-to-day life from being broadcast on Venmo, make sure to change the settings. Inside the app, click on the Me tab, tap the settings icon and select Privacy. Under default privacy settings, select Private. Then, under the “More” section in Privacy, click “Past Transactions” and make sure to set that to “Change All to Private.”
Your Contacts List
Venmo has made the contacts list, which can be generated from your smartphone’s address book or your Facebook friends list, viewable to any other user on the app.
That can make a lot of information public. In 2021, my New York Times colleague Ryan Mac, who was then at BuzzFeed News, used Venmo to discover President Joe Biden’s account and personal contacts list. Biden later deleted his Venmo account.
On a personal level, a public address book can reveal a new romantic partner to an ex. For professionals, it could expose a doctor’s patients, a journalist’s sources or a salesperson’s clients.
To hide your contacts list from public view, visit the privacy settings, click on Friends List and select Private. Also, toggle off the option for “appear in other users’ friends lists.”
Review, Then Review Again
All tech companies change their data-sharing features and settings over time. So take a moment to scroll through your phone and review the settings inside apps you haven’t used in a while to see if there’s something you missed.
Do Thi Duc, now a graphics editor at The New York Times, said she wasn’t surprised that Venmo was still making headlines, because the app relied on people’s public oversharing as a marketing mechanism. She said she deleted her Venmo account when conducting her research on the company.
After writing this column, I did the same.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Neither Olivia Amitrano nor Nicholas Vazquez are afraid to change their minds, whether it's about living off the grid, work or a wedding dress.
Olivia Grace Amitrano and Nicholas Ryan Vazquez were only teenagers when they met. Still, they somehow had the sense to take it slow, which allowed their relationship to go the distance.
They met on Oct. 5, 2009 at Gino's Pizzeria in Yonkers, N.Y., where both had grown up, when Ms. Amitrano was 16 and Mr. Vazquez was 18. She was with her best friend at the time, who occasionally dated his brother.
Ms. Amitrano had heard Mr. Vazquez was "quite the ladies' man," so she did her best to play it cool, though she found him charming. Both Ms. Amitrano, now 29, and Mr. Vazquez, 31, were seeing other people on and off at the time. They would see one another at parties and, "he tried pursuing me," Ms. Amitrano said, but they remained friends.
Their connection grew nonetheless. They would spend late nights parked in front of her house in his 1990 champagne-colored Volvo and take turns playing their favorite R&B songs on their iPods. "We slowly fell in love over many nights venting and bonding in his car," Ms. Amitrano said.
But the two didn't see one another for six months starting in November 2010 while Mr. Vazquez gave it one last try with his on-and-off girlfriend of several years. It didn't work. On May 26, 2011, just a few weeks after Ms. Amitrano happened to have broken up with her high school boyfriend, Mr. Vazquez contacted her out of the blue.
Mr. Vazquez admitted that he thought about her often and "truly just wanted any excuse to see her."
"He needed lunch at work and was short on cash," Ms. Amitrano said. "I brought him microwaved mixed vegetables with butter and pasta that I boiled with the tomato sauce."
As she handed him a Tupperware container, "We exchanged the most casual hello kiss, as if we'd been married for 20 years," Ms. Amitrano said. "Our eyes both widened as we panicked a bit, recognizing how second-nature that moment felt."
The very next day, Mr. Vazquez brought her a Caesar salad. "I guess bringing food was our love language," Ms. Amitrano said.
On Aug. 30, 2011, the week before Ms. Amitrano was to begin attending Fordham, she said she told Mr. Vazquez they needed to "figure out what we're doing." He didn't want to hold her back, he told her. He wanted her to have the full "college experience," he said. "But, I told him, 'I know what I want,"' Ms. Amitrano said. "'You're my boyfriend."'
"As long as you know what you want," Mr. Vazquez said, with what Ms. Amitrano called "the sweetest smirk on his face."
After having what Ms. Amitrano described as "a life-changing, eye-opening experience with a local Chinese medicine practitioner and herbalist," while looking for remedies for some challenging health issues she was experiencing in college, she discovered an interest in integrative medicine.
So, in 2013, she began Organic Olivia, blogging and writing e-books about healthy living. In late 2014, she also started Living Earth Jewelry, making and selling jewelry, as she grew the Organic Olivia brand.
"What was once a simple blog turned into an e-commerce website with an herbal remedy line of products in 2016," Ms. Amitrano said. She closed the jewelry business in September 2019 to focus on Organic Olivia, an herbal supplement company.
Mr. Vazquez had been designing and embroidering the interiors of caskets at a local factory from late 2009 until May 2014 when he decided to pursue unionized ironwork. "For me, the union was a natural choice," he said. "I was looking to work with my hands and also receive a decent paycheck."
But ironwork didn't suit Mr. Vazquez, particularly because of the health risks. So, once she was sure it was what he really wanted, Ms. Amitrano agreed to have him join her in working on the business. "I would design and he would painstakingly put the intricate pieces together," Ms. Amitrano said. "I did the marketing and he did the customer service. I did the handwritten thank you notes and he did the mailing."
When Ms. Amitrano graduated from college in May 2015, the two found an apartment together in Yonkers. After living there for two years, they decided to try living off the grid in Costa Rica beginning mid-February 2017.

"We wanted to have a technology detox -- let's hang out and eat fruit," Mr. Vazquez said. They lasted six weeks.
"Turns out, it's not our thing," Ms. Amitrano said. "He's terrified of landslides and it was getting to be rainy season." They left Costa Rica to travel for a bit before moving in with Ms. Amitrano's parents in Yonkers as they searched for a place to live.
They landed on a new apartment building in Yonkers. "It was a disaster," Ms. Amitrano said. "The heat didn't work. The windows weren't sealed. The maintenance was terrible." They left in November 2019, opting instead to rent a townhouse in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., where they still live.
Ms. Amitrano, a certified herbalist and the chief executive of Oganic Olivia, has a bachelor's degree in psychology from Fordham. She completed a three-year clinical herbalist program through the ArborVitae School of Traditional Herbalism in Brooklyn and Suzanne Robidoux's Classical Chinese Medicine Course (Jing Fang) virtually.
Mr. Vazquez, a graduate of Charles E. Gorton High School, is currently developing recipes for a new cookbook of mostly Caribbean and Latin cuisine based on his Puerto Rican and Ecuadorean roots.
After being together for nearly a decade, Mr. Vazquez said he observed that they "were still able to grow and, most importantly, grow in a similar direction."
"I knew it was time to pop the question," he said. On June 3, 2021, Mr. Vazquez and Ms. Amitrano were recording the first episode of the second season for Ms. Amitrano's podcast "What's the Juice," while also being filmed. They were discussing their 10-year anniversary and he proposed.
She was shocked. "He is someone who appreciates privacy, so doing this in front of a camera and on a podcast episode was the last thing I would ever expect," Ms. Amitrano said.
After keeping the engagement a secret for three weeks, they held an engagement party disguised as a podcast launch party where they surprised their families. A month later, the podcast was released and so was their big news.
The two were wed July 15 before 93 guests at Foxfire Mountain House in Mount Tremper, N.Y. Sylva Dvorak, who was ordained by the Universal Life Church, led the ceremony. Mr. Vazquez said, "I thought the wedding venue represented us perfectly as a couple, full of life and nature." Ms. Amitrano said she loved "the rawness of the venue, being surrounded by native flowers and plants, letting earth be our backdrop."
On the dock of the property's lake, one hour before the official ceremony, Ms. Amitrano said, "We said our private promises to each other, took time to ground and center, and soak in the moment of 'look around -- we made it."'
The groom wore an ivory jacket and black pants by Alan David Custom.
Ms. Amitrano originally purchased a white Danielle Frankel gown to wear. But at a fitting three weeks before the wedding, "I realized the dress was so not me," she said. "I got roped into the bridal consumer world thinking I needed the fanciest, trendiest designer dress."
So, 10 days before the wedding, she ordered a vintage, 1950s, pink dress from eBay for $ 200. "It was perfect," she said. "Walking down the aisle in my pink vintage gown, with bright blue, sparkly, $ 28 vintage earrings was the best decision I ever made."
Because she could not return the original dress, she did wear it for part of the reception, before changing into a short dress by Rotate Birger Christensen for dancing. But it was her ceremony gown that was everything she dreamed of. Ms. Amitrano said, "I wanted the dress to feel real, to feel true to our relationship and to my playful inner child."

Skipping the Sauce Although there was alcohol provided for guests at the reception, the couple themselves opted not to partake. "We felt much more present and clear-hearted with our people and truly savored each moment with each other," Ms. Amitrano said. "We were really there in our eyes."
Getting Creative In lieu of a honeymoon, the two spent the week after the wedding creating art in the new home they purchased in Hastings-on-Hudson on June 15 while it is still undergoing renovations on the second floor. "There's no furniture, only endless canvases, two easels, and paint strewn around the floor," Ms. Amitrano said. "We spent every day painting together in the summer light, singing and listening to music, honoring those two kids in the car 12 years ago."
Playing Around Ms. Amitrano made designing her full look part of the wedding day activities, "bringing a whole bunch of funky and vintage accessories, playing dress up and picking them out with my bridesmaids moments before walking down the aisle," she said.

Ban of Incandescent Bulbs Reignites Regulatory Debate: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A ban on most kinds of traditional bulbs renews a cultural squabble between regulatory efforts to curb energy consumption and the very American impulse to do whatever one wants in one's domicile.
The switchboard at Lightbulbs.com, a (pretty self-explanatory) e-commerce website, lit up with panicked callers on Tuesday, who all wanted to know if the news was true.
Had the government just banned the sale of incandescent bulbs?
Yes, mostly.
Was this decision part of an elaborate political plot?
No, mostly.
Just what were fans of incandescent lighting supposed to do now?
EBay, maybe?
Much like its cousin, the gas stove, the humble light bulb has become a flashpoint in a cultural squabble between environmental regulatory efforts and the very American impulse to do whatever one wants in one's domicile. But unlike the gas stove debate, which grew so heated (sorry) that it drew legislation from Republicans hoping to protect the noble but possibly dangerous appliance, the ban on the sale of most incandescent bulbs went quietly into effect on August 1. (The Biden administration denied trying to ban gas stoves.)
The response to the bulb ban was more of a whimper than a battle cry.
"Thomas Edison brought the incandescent light bulb to the masses, and in 2023 Joe Biden banned it in America," officials with the Republican Party of New Mexico wrote in a tweet. "The Biden administration's government overreach continues."
Other critics were more concerned about the quality of light affecting their quality of life: "I often stay up late at my desk, and the warm glow of the lamp is like company as I read and write. Ugh. There are people in power who are dedicated to sucking all joy out of the world," Joseph Massey, a self-described "not woke" writer, tweeted.
Paul McLellan, who owns Lightbulbs.com and whose family has sold lighting since the 1950s, said that the move was better for the environment but kind of bad for sales.
"We've been trying to get the word out there, and nobody is talking about it," said Mr. McLellan, whose 15 call-center employees have become lighting therapists for distressed callers overnight. "These are little heaters that we are lighting our homes and business with."
Mr. McLellan added that he had to agree "logically" that the bulbs "are not environmentally friendly," even though he was lamenting the loss in sales from what he said was a poor rollout from the government and media. Still, he called the story of the vanishing light bulb a "bipartisan issue," which is correct.
The saga began 16 years ago, when President George W. Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The law did not ban the sale of incandescent bulbs, but required bulbs that used between 40 and 100 watts of electricity to gradually become more energy efficient.
Just before President Barack Obama left office in January 2017, his administration enacted further regulation around several types of incandescent bulbs.
Then came President Donald J. Trump, who wiped out the Obama-era regulations and added a personal note about his dislike of energy-efficient lighting.
"They took away our light bulb," Mr. Trump said, incorrectly, in 2019. "I want an incandescent light. I want to look better, OK? I want to pay less money to look better. Does that make sense? You pay much less money, and you look much better."
That, too, was untrue: New bulb models, called LED bulbs, cost more upfront but last longer and use less electricity, which equals a lower utility bill, according to experts.
In another speech, Mr. Trump said energy-efficient bulbs always made him "look orange" -- more of an opinion than fact.
President Biden, who has been under pressure to take further regulatory action to protect the environment, undid Mr. Trump's undoing of the regulations by announcing new rules. The Energy Department said last year that the manufacturing and sale of incandescent bulbs would be gradually phased out in 2023. Recent polling shows that a majority of Americans support the federal government setting stricter efficiency standards for appliances and buildings.
According to a timeline released by the department, manufacturers were told to stop making the bulbs in January. On Tuesday, retailers like Mr. McLellan were told to stop the sale of them.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Republican National Committee said that incandescent bulbs were another casualty of "Biden's unhealthy obsession" with reducing carbon emissions.
Not all versions of the bulbs will be banned, but it will become increasingly hard to find the everyday versions of them, like those that provide that flattering light in the dining room or study. It could be harder to find bulbs by wattage as a metric associated with LEDs, called the lumen, becomes the standard. Some types of incandescents will still be available, including bug lamps and "odd sized" bulbs, according to a roundup by CNN.
One of the concerns of retailers, according to Mr. McLellan, is that unsold bulbs will have to be disposed of, likely in landfills: "If you're truly thinking about the environment, shut off manufacturing and let distribution sell through," Mr. McLellan said.
On Tuesday, a spokesman with the Energy Department, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that the agency's "enforcement office is committed to enforcing the agency's regulations in a fair and equitable manner," and urged retailers to contact the agency about "flexibilities with their inventory."

How to Fix Main Street: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: For two decades, Steven Wyatt was in a cycle of drug addiction and rehab. In 2006, during a stint at a recovery center, he learned how to restore furniture, a skill that led him to an unexpected place: running his own store in Poole, a coastal town in southwest England.
Mr. Wyatt, 46, is among a handful of beneficiaries of an unusual experiment in real estate and urban renewal. His store, Restored Retro, is one of 10 businesses that were given two years of free rent for an empty storefront on a small shopping street in Poole called Kingland Crescent.
The offer came from the property's owner, Legal & General Investment Management, Britain's largest asset manager, which had been struggling to revive a near-derelict shopping street next to a mall, in an uneasy economy still reeling from the pandemic.
"It's been a massive learning curve for them and for us," Mr. Wyatt said. "I've never had this much responsibility."
The rent-free period, which ended in April, not only has changed the lives of Mr. Wyatt and several other small-business owners, but it has also transformed the street, which now has a constant flow of foot traffic in an area that many locals used to avoid. Even the adjacent shopping mall is bucking the national trend, with more visitors now than in 2019.
Half of the original 10 businesses offered space on Kingland Crescent are still there, and those that left were quickly replaced by new local businesses ready to pay rent. There is a sense that momentum is building in Poole's transformation.
"Poole is becoming a destination again," Mr. Wyatt said.
Poole is just a couple of miles away from some of the most expensive coastal real estate in the country, but its town center was stuck in a rut. The mall had swaths of dark, empty spaces, and a stretch of the town's larger shopping district was trapped in the past, with old brands long forgotten in more vibrant places.
The shake-up of Kingland Crescent began during pandemic lockdowns as Britons bemoaned the death of their beloved high streets, which are comparable to American main streets. Their survival was a priority for the government, which announced billions in grants to revitalize them.
But lately, the government has been consumed by other crises, including the highest inflation rates in four decades, rapidly rising food prices and soaring mortgage payments, which are amounting to a deep cost-of-living crisis.
"Retail in England has been in trouble for a long time," said Anthony Breach, a senior analyst at Centre for Cities, a think tank. Even before the pandemic, "there was an oversupply of retail space, particularly in a places with less successful economies."
Many high streets needed major transformation if they hoped to survive the shift away from in-store shopping at big national retail chains that dominated them, he added.
There are encouraging signs of progress. Fewer stores closed in Britain last year than the year before, and some empty department stores have found new life as leisure centers with go-karting or planned residences. Foot traffic on high streets across the country was about 5 percent higher in June compared with last year, though it's still below prepandemic levels.
"There are high streets that are decimated," said Mark Robinson, chair of the High Streets Task Force, a body set up by the government. "Likewise, there are places that are still going to get worse. But on balance, we can really look to having been through the worst, and I genuinely don't think people are talking about the death of the high street anymore."
High streets across the country are facing diverging fortunes. Poole has improved after the risk taken by Legal & General Investment Management, which owns about 36 billion pounds (about $ 43 billion) in homes, retail, offices and other real estate. Other small high streets have benefited from residents staying closer to home to work and socialize.
But many others, especially in larger towns or cities, are still blighted by empty department stores and shuttered outposts of national brands.
The differences are apparent in Bournemouth, a larger town a few miles east of Poole with a big student population. Economic prosperity varies widely across the region, but the median income in Bournemouth, Poole and their surrounding towns was about 7 percent below the national average, according to official statistics from 2022.
Three department stores in Bournemouth closed, and the exit of big retail chains has left several streets with empty storefronts. Two years ago, the town had ambitious plans to fill the vacant space, but they have been slow to materialize. The main success has been the reopening of a former Debenhams department store as Bobby's, which has a beauty hall, a cafe and stalls for local businesses.
Four other large sites (two former department stores and two cinemas) are in the early stages of redevelopment, said Paul Kinvig, who manages the town's business improvement district.
"I'm encouraged by the fact that there are plans for all of them, but there's a pace issue," he said.
Progress is slow in Bournemouth, but in Poole, Kingland Crescent has become a nexus for independent businesses. The overhaul provided a dose of modernization with the arrival of an Instagram-friendly plant store, a coffee shop with a roastery in the back and a gin bar, among others. And the free rent allowed them to grow quickly.
For the landlord, the program was a bet on the long term. Providing free rent to entrepreneurs, even those with no formal business experience, has been part of its strategy to make its properties more resilient to an ever-changing economy and less reliant on big national retailers, said Matt Soffair, who leads retail research at Legal & General Investment Management.
"We're not just doing this to do a nice thing for the people of Poole," he added. "We are also doing this because we do believe that in the long term, all these initiatives will create cash flow."
Before moving to Kingland Crescent, Mr. Wyatt's furniture restoration business was a shoestring operation. At times, he painted furniture in his garden and sold the pieces on eBay.
Since opening his shop, he has sold more than a thousand pieces. He specializes in restoring midcentury items, such as a sideboard by the Danish designer Ib Kofod-Larsen and a dressing table by the British design company Archie Shine. In March, around the time rent payments began, Mr. Wyatt doubled the store's footprint, taking over a vacant space next door in collaboration with Jay Blades, star of the BBC series "The Repair Shop."
Three doors down from Mr. Wyatt is Wild Roots, a plant store owned by Hope Dean, 29, who was laid off from her events management job early in the pandemic. A few months later, she secured a space on Kingland Crescent, which is now a calming haven of greenery. She employs six people, and her company has three branches: the retail store, a plant design service for businesses and plant care services.
"It feels like a proper business now," Ms. Dean said.
A sleek record store that hosts live music nights, a jeweler with pieces delicately carved from titanium and a clothing shop that previously had only an online presence have recently joined the lineup. They each have to pay rent, but several said they were still getting a good deal.
Changes on Kingland Crescent have flowed into the neighboring shopping center that Legal & General also owns. On the desolate upper floors of the mall, the landlord put in a diagnostics center run by the National Health Service, an adult education center and a co-working space. Market stalls are open several days a week on the ground floor, along with a space for free events and services, such as day care, craft fairs and historical exhibits.
But the tenants of Kingland Crescent still face challenges. Their leases are up for renewal in about a year, meaning their futures are uncertain. Foot traffic can be unpredictable, tenants say, and there is little other nightlife, a problem for the bar.
"Poole was our pilot," said Denizer Ibrahim, who leads the retail strategy at Legal & General. After two years of gathering data, the landlord is thinking about what worked and can be replicated elsewhere. But it does not expect to offer free rent again.
The strategy, Mr. Ibrahim said, is to end the "cookie cutter" high streets that were the norm a few years ago, and instead curate a space with a diverse mix of global and local companies in retail and other services.
That range of use for retail spaces "would have never been even spoken about if it wasn't for Kingland," he said.

An experiment in Poole began during the pandemic, when free rent allowed high street businesses there to grow quickly, bringing a surge in foot traffic. (B1); Poole, England, is just a few miles away from some of the most expensive coastal real estate in the country, but its town center was stuck in a rut. Now, its main street, Kingland Crescent, is a nexus for independent businesses. "We do believe that in the long term, all these initiatives will create cash flow," said Matt Soffair, who leads retail research at the shops' landlord.; Bournemouth, left and above, a larger town a few miles east of Poole, has also experienced store closures. But Poole has transformed, as stores like Brakeburn Clothing, top left, and Boiler Room Records, top right, bring foot traffic to Kingland Crescent. "Poole is becoming a destination again," said Steven Wyatt, who owns a furniture restoration shop.

Make Your Clematis Last All Season: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Because there's no such thing as too much Clematis, here's how to get a little more -- and make it last a little longer.
It's hard to imagine that the aphorism warning about too much of a good thing could ever apply to Clematis, whose charming flowers and mostly lightweight climbing vines make them irresistible.
Dan Long, of Brushwood Nursery, in Athens, Ga., certainly has never been scared off by the prospect of overdoing it. Mr. Long has amassed a collection of more than 400 kinds of Clematis. He can count on them to bloom from early spring through late fall, but he always has his eye out for exceptional additions -- more native species, perhaps, or varieties with a particular fragrance.
He is quick to note, however, that you don't need a collection the size of his to achieve a season-long Clematis display: It's within reach of every garden. But it does require a strategic choice of varieties, based on staggered bloom times. You also have to master what Mr. Long calls the "refreshing techniques" that can coax maximum flowering.
Even the Clematis you're already growing may have more to offer than they're currently delivering, with a little well-timed advice from someone like Mr. Long, who started Brushwood Nursery 25 years ago. His onetime "scrappy nights-and-weekends" project -- which began in a rented greenhouse in Kennett Square, Pa., from which he sold plants on eBay -- moved south to bigger quarters and a longer growing season in 2010, and now ships more than 6,000 orders a year.
Getting an Earlier Start
Although large-flowered hybrids like Henryi, with its ample white blooms, and velvety-red Niobe are the most familiar varieties, you'll have to wait until late spring for the show if those are the only Clematis plants in your garden. You can change that by shopping for Clematis the same way you would for tulips or Narcissus -- by tracking down early, midseason and late varieties.
The show will start earlier with varieties of Clematis alpina, with their smaller, nodding flowers, Mr. Long said, or C. macropetala, whose blooms are sometimes described as resembling double-flowered columbines.
Clematis montana blooms early, too. That extra-vigorous, pink- or white-flowered species, which can grow to 20 or 30 feet, easily covers a pergola or fence. The montanas are less hardy than many other Clematis, though -- only to Zones 6 or 7.
If you want early flowers as well as distinctive fragrance, consider two 10-year-old introductions, Sugar-Sweet Lilac and Sugar-Sweet Blue, offspring of Clematis cadmia. Mr. Long describes the blue selection as having "a wonderful gardenia-like scent" and the lilac as smelling like orange blossoms (or maybe lemon with a touch of vanilla). Both have three-inch flowers on vines reaching around six feet, making them good candidates to grow in a big pot that can be moved around the patio for up-close enjoyment.
Are You Watering and Feeding Enough?
The popular large-flowered hybrids, with blooms as big as 10 inches across, start flowering next.
But "there are seasons within them, as well," Mr. Long noted. Certain varieties start later than others, another chance to subtly stagger the display.
There is a more dramatic tactic, though, that many of us haven't tried: Cut the vines back to a third of their height after they bloom, he suggested, as this may prompt a later flush of flowers. We do it with perennials like catmint (Nepeta), so why not Clematis?
Follow the haircut with an application of an all-natural organic fertilizer and deep, thorough watering. Mr. Long recommends Espoma Rose-tone -- "because there is no Clematis-tone ... yet," he said, smiling. An organic tomato fertilizer would also work. Follow the label directions regarding frequency and the amount to use.
For gardeners with any Clematis that isn't blooming well, there may be an insight to glean from that trick, he said: Your plants may want more fertility and deeper watering. Although Clematis can live for up to 50 years, their needs are misunderstood, owing to a much-repeated myth that says they "like their feet in the shade and faces in the sun" -- as if that's the full prescription.
"That's a simplification," Mr. Long said. "What's true is that they need a lot of water during the growing season to perform their best, and people think shady spots are moister. But then all those shade plants growing around their feet compete for resources."
The upshot: Your Clematis plants don't get enough.
When to Prune? The Plants Will Tell You
Another place we get off track: When to prune which Clematis?
The timing is usually explained relative to the pruning category a plant is in -- Type 1, 2 or 3 -- but gardeners who don't know the type they have (or maybe even its name, to research the type) may be at a loss.
The reveal is right in front of us: The easiest way to know when to prune is based on when a plant blooms.
All the early bloomers (Type 1) set their flower buds on old wood, so it's best to prune out damaged or stray stems after they bloom, to tidy up the plant.
At the other extreme, late-flowered Clematis (Type 3) bloom only on new wood, and are the easiest of all to prune: Cut them nearly to the ground just before growth begins in spring.
Most large-flowered hybrids (Type 2) can bloom on old and new wood -- meaning they are capable of repeat flowering. In late winter or early spring, when their buds begin to swell, cut just above the fat buds, either lower or higher on the vine.
"Typically you want to get low," Mr. Long said. "But a lot of Type 2s are genetically complex and can be treated like Type 3: Cut back hard, so you only get flowers on new wood."
Blooming will start a few weeks or a month later than usual, so experiment, he advised.
Summer-Into-Fall Performers
Summer- or later-blooming Clematis are especially good for growing up and over an early flowering shrub that will be green afterward. For example, you can really dress up a Forsythia, Mr. Long said, with the four-inch-wide, summer-into-fall pink flowers of Comtesse de Bouchaud.
In between the earliest and latest large-flowered hybrids are some long-blooming standouts with the species Clematis viticella in their genes: Madame Julia Correvon, Betty Corning, Etoile Violette and the dramatically striped Venosa Violacea can all produce several flower flushes.
Another choice, from different parentage: Paul Farges (or Summer Snow), which produces many weeks of frothy, white flowers. At 15 feet or so, it is best grown over a fence or wall, or even up a small tree.
For summer and fall flowering combined with the surprise of the color yellow -- an uncommon hue in Clematis -- try C. tangutica.
The common name "sweet autumn clematis" used to be synonymous with late-season bloom, but Clematis terniflora is now known to be invasive and should not be planted. The native C. virginiana, "though not quite as flashy or fragrant," Mr. Long said, makes a smart substitute if later frothy, white blooms are wanted.
It is just one of many small-flowered natives with long bloom seasons to consider, including various members of the Viorna group that are native to the Southeast and lower Midwest, even straying into the Rockies a bit. Some viornas have earned the common name of leather flower for the thick-textured sepals of their pendulous, bell-shaped flowers.
Clematis crispa, another mostly Southeastern species, makes blue-and-white flowers that resemble small bells. Similarly shaped, red-flowered C. texensis is a Texas native.
Just Getting Started?
Can a man with so many Clematis plants possibly name just a few that a garden should not be without?
Mr. Long is especially fond of H. F. Young, which produces big, pale blue flowers in late spring that repeat in late summer. And "Polish Spirit is an easy win," he said of the purple-flowered climber that shows off from midsummer into autumn.
"So is Arabella," he said, describing it as "a scrambler," with flowers that start off blue-mauve and fade to pale blue. Use it as a ground cover, he recommended, or let it weave among your perennials.
A newer variety, deep blue Hudson River, blooms all summer, and at only four or five feet is likewise well suited to mingling among perennials.
And then there are the non-vining ones he terms "blooming machines," including some outstanding hybrids of Clematis integrifolia, a herbaceous species that grows to only about three feet. (Hudson River and Arabella both have integrifolia in them, in fact.)
"Some of the better integrifolia hybrids just go and go," he said. Mississippi River is another he especially likes.
On the subject of non-vining types, perhaps the most distinctive are the Clematis recta purpurea varieties, including Serious Black (also known as Lime Close) and Midnight Masquerade.
And yes, there's a trick to urging multiple shows from them as well -- although one with a bit of a twist.
"Some people really like that fresh purple, so they'll cut it back when the foliage fades to greener, just to get more of the darker color," Mr. Long said.
That may not result in additional flowers, but it still amounts to an extra performance from yet another happy-to-cooperate Clematis.

A Barbie World Reflects the Real World: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A new project from the Real Estate desk uses stop-motion to take readers inside Barbie's Dreamhouses.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
One afternoon last summer, Anna Kodé, a reporter on the Real Estate desk at The New York Times, and Nikita Stewart, the desk's editor, were talking about the upcoming "Barbie" film when, naturally, the conversation turned to Barbie's personal pad, the Dreamhouse.
Ms. Kodé had long wanted to write about the dollhouse that had captured the imagination of many young Americans for decades.
"While people have really analyzed the social significance of Barbie, we hadn't had that same conversation about the Dreamhouse," Ms. Kodé said in an interview. "We wanted to spark that."
So she began researching the history of the Dreamhouse and interviewing experts, including executives at Mattel, the makers of Barbie, as well as scholars in various fields. She wanted to understand how changes in society shaped versions of the Dreamhouse over the last 60-plus years.
The article, which was published this past week, documents the ways in which Barbie's Dreamhouses reflect the social, cultural and economic evolution of modern American life. For example: In 1962, when Mattel released Barbie's first Dreamhouse, financial institutions often denied mortgage applications from single women. Barbie's ranch-style home was modest but all her own, and unlike dollhouses of decades past, it was not built around the idea of domestic roles -- it didn't even have a kitchen. By 1974, when the Equal Credit Opportunity Act was passed, banning credit discrimination, Barbie's Dreamhouse got a glamorous upgrade to three stories.
Ms. Kodé wrote about this rich history, using Barbie's Dreamhouses to mark different historical moments. Stop-motion animations accompany the text; each animation allows viewers to explore a Dreamhouse.
In May, Ms. Kodé, along with Tony Cenicola, a Times photographer; Michael Kolomatsky, a Real Estate editor; and Gabriel Gianordoli, an assistant editor for Digital News Design, purchased a Dreamhouse from 2000 on eBay and bought several Barbies at a flea market to take test photographs. Using the toys, they mapped out the art direction and lighting. But they also practiced moving and photographing Barbie using the stop-motion technique. By ever so slightly adjusting a pointed foot or a plastic arm, and repeating that effort around 100 times between frames, the journalists could make it appear as if Barbie were moving around the house.
Ms. Kodé reached out to Mattel to see if the team could have access to its headquarters in El Segundo, Calif. Mattel granted their request and provided over 20 archival Barbies and six Dreamhouses for their use.
The team visited Mattel in late May. They spent more than 18 hours over two days in a windowless studio, painstakingly arranging the Barbies in the Dreamhouses. (They went through a lot of wire and glue to keep Barbie in place.) Some Dreamhouses took over an hour to set up; the longest shoot required moving Barbie 137 times. Mr. Cenicola photographed each setup patiently; he was familiar with stop-motion, having previously used the technique in 2020 in an article about New York State's ban on plastic bags.
The team wanted to capture moments that felt true to each era. In the house from 1962, Barbie is photographed playing a record. In the 1970s, a decade that experienced an environmental movement, she is pictured leaning over her plants.
"For each time period, we had Barbie do actions that spoke to that," Ms. Kodé said. "In the section that touches on the sexual revolution, we wanted Ken to walk up to the house and give Barbie a rose."
Though many scenes represented social trends, some also reflected how economic shifts affected the real estate market. For example, when the size of the average American house grew in the 1990s, Barbie got a (sparkly pink) McMansion. But the toys didn't mirror every shift in the market: As Ms. Kodé noted, Barbie was spared from downsizing during times of economic downturn.
After visiting Mattel, Mr. Cenicola spent several days editing the photographs, removing items such as wires and adjusting slight variations in exposure and tone. Then he combined certain frames, adjusting the speed or alternating the action forward and backward, to give the appearance of movement.
While working with toys -- even as adults -- can be fun, the journalists approached the photo shoot with the understanding that there was an important story to be told.
"We were trying to strike a balance between it being a little fun but not being goofy because the tone of the story is very serious," Mr. Gianordoli said. "It's a history lesson."
Assembling the Dreamhouses, Ms. Kodé said, is something she'll never forget. Though she played with plenty of Barbies growing up, she said she never had her own Dreamhouse.
For articles, Ms. Kodé said, "I have tried on Joan Didion's sunglasses. I have been to fashion shows. I've been to museum openings. But I had never played with toys for two full days in a row."

Investigators Examine Ship That Tugged The Titan: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Investigators boarded the Polar Prince, which docked at the Atlantic headquarters of the Canadian Coast Guard, looking for answers.
Escorted to a Canadian Coast Guard base, the ship that launched the ill-fated Titan submersible returned from international waters to its home port, St. John's, Newfoundland, on Saturday morning, where investigators boarded it looking for answers.
For hours, a procession of about a dozen people -- including investigators from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police -- boarded or exited the ship, the Polar Prince, which docked at the Atlantic headquarters of the coast guard.
Pulling large plastic equipment cases, the transportation safety investigators were expected to look for clues that might explain what went wrong aboard the Titan, a submersible that took wealthy passengers from around the world on $ 250,000 tours of the Titanic wreck site, 12,500 feet below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean.
On Thursday, a search-and-rescue effort by international teams came to an end, after debris was discovered on the ocean floor, about 1,600 feet from the Titanic wreck, and U.S. Coast Guard officials announced that the missing vessel had most likely imploded, killing the five people on board.
Because the Titan lacked propulsion, the Polar Prince, a Canadian ship owned by Miawpukek Horizon Maritime Service, had tugged the Titan to its launch point and ferried the Titan's passengers and others to their destination.
The Polar Prince remained near the launch point until the authorities ended the search and it headed to the regional coast guard headquarters. A floating platform that had been used to carry the Titan was brought in separately by a large, orange ocean vessel supply ship.
More than an hour after the ships arrived, about a dozen people clad in orange safety vests and wearing white hard hats entered the vessel.
On Friday, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada announced the investigation and arrived in St. John's lugging duffel bags and hard cases emblazoned with its name or initials.
Kathy Fox, the chairwoman of the safety board, said that family members of the five people who were inside the submersible when it was destroyed were among the 41 people on the ship when it sailed on June 18. Another official with the safety investigation body said that 17 of the people aboard belonged to the ship's crew.
The family members were among the people who were interviewed on Saturday by the safety board. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said that it separately conducted interviews with passengers and crew on the ship as part of a preliminary examination to determine if a criminal investigation was warranted.
"We've received full cooperation," Ms. Fox told reporters. "It has been a really good interaction thus far."
Ms. Fox said that the United States Coast Guard would be in charge of recovering and examining the remains of the Titan now on the ocean floor, but that her agency would analyze any of its findings.
The Polar Prince was built in 1959 as a light icebreaker and buoy tender for the Canadian Coast Guard, which named it Sir Humphrey Gilbert. After being taken out of government service in 2001, the ship was renamed Gilbert 1 and changed hands several times.
That swirl of owners included one who listed it on eBay in 2005 with a starting bid of $ 1 million.
The owners of Miawpukek Horizon Maritime Service include the Miawpukek Mi'kamawey Mawi'omi First Nation in Conne River, Newfoundland.
The Polar Prince set off from its home port of St. John's on Sunday for the excursion to the Titanic wreck site. The ship had lain in dock several weeks before that as it was preparing for the voyage, which was delayed under inclement weather.
It returned on Saturday under sunny skies and warm weather.

The Millennial Dad's Canon: [Style Desk]

Full text: On the big day, my wife gamely brought home a No. 1 Dad mug, which I sometimes drink coffee out of, and a No. 1 Dad T-shirt, which I sometimes sleep in, and a No. 1 Dad grilling spatula, which can be used to brand hamburgers and tuna steaks. This all made for a well-received Instagram post. But to be honest, it didn't really make me feel like a dad, let alone the No. 1 dad. Instead, I felt like a guy whose response to a major life milestone was to hide inside a bit.
When I think about my stepfather, who raised me, I think about the way he wielded his grill tongs, padding around the deck in his tapioca-colored apron, as if it were the most natural act in the world. Or the way he turned down the volume on the national television broadcast of N.F.L. games in favor of the local radio announcers, who "weren't idiots." Or the way he sought out a maritime museum anywhere we went on family vacation. I'm now a father of two with three years of experience, but if I tried any of those things today, I would hear a little voice in my head, saying, "Look at the big dad man, dadding it up for his family!"
"Irony has seeped into the felt of any fedora that I have ever owned -- not out of any wish of mine, but out of necessity," the essayist George W.S. Trow wrote in 1980 of his father's beloved headwear. "A fedora hat worn by me without the necessary protective irony would eat through my head and kill me."
So many of the signifiers that spring to mind when we think about dads are like this: Dated or goofy or vestigial or naïve. Take the riding lawn mower, a relic from a time before climate change made us cringe at the smell of burning gas. Or the Playboy stash, an anachronism of print culture. Or the mechanical wristwatch, an antique you can't even use to order pizza.
After three years of diaper blowouts and day-care-spawned plagues (Ever heard of something called "pleurisy"? Neither had I), I've come to see the old dad ways a little more sympathetically, and with some measure of recognition. After all, our dads were responding to the same essential dad conflict we are: the tension between giving your life over to the needs of your family and keeping enough mental space for yourself to stay sane. In that context, the rider mower makes brilliant sense. It's alone time ("What? Honey? I can't hear you! This thing's loud, huh!") that accomplishes a putatively necessary domestic task.
Still, the touchstones of Boomer dad culture have outlived their descriptive usefulness for younger generations. What, we might ask, is dad culture in 2023? Does it even exist?
Over the past month, I've reached out to dozens of millennial fathers -- friends, colleagues, perfect strangers -- to help me conduct a bit of qualitative research into the customs of the newish American dad.
I asked them what are the clothes, appliances, skills, movies, TV shows, books, video games, opinions, conversations and habits of mind that define being a dad today?
The warmth and eagerness with which they responded, often at great length and featuring Talmudic levels of nuance, suggests it's a question many of us have been mulling, privately, for quite some time.
Behind that enthusiasm, I think, is a real desire for many fathers to better define the social role they've taken on. One that has been deeply, if nebulously, changed by our evolving understanding of masculinity and who is responsible for household labor. What is the right balance between provider and caregiver? What is the amount of dumb bro stuff that can be retained? What positively distinguishes fatherhood from motherhood -- and why do even the more gender-enlightened, egalitarian among us still seem to want that identity to feel distinct?
Looking at the list as a whole, a few patterns emerge. The first is that technology and convenience have rendered optional many of the stereotypically analog dad skills of yore: Navigating, oil changing -- things of that nature. Our shows of skill are more likely to occur deep within a set of nested digital menus.
Or instead, we might demonstrate our authority through displays of taste. The millennial dad, who has spent his young adulthood becoming a sophisticated consumer, has had to negotiate a place for all this miscellaneous expertise in his family life. (Doing so can be complicated. There is no entry for coffee in the canon; those surveyed were split between dads who favored ever more complicated coffee setups and those who have made a brave -- and highly symbolic -- break with their Hario V60 in favor of a cavernous Mr. Coffee.)
Finally, the new dad culture has definitely not found it necessary to put away childish things. Fantasy football, old video games, Star Wars -- dads are finding ways to preserve the pleasures of boyhood.
There's an argument to be made that the millennial father is trapped in an eternal adolescence. But that doesn't feel right, at least to me, and certainly not to my knees, which feel every day of 38 years old. I happen to think the new dad culture reflects something positive, and even sweet: that the American father is expected, rightly, to share more of himself -- his time, his feelings, and even his most childish hobbies -- with his family.
That's why we have strong opinions about children's television and baby hiking carriers: We're trying our best at this thing. This thing, which lasts a lifetime and doesn't even come with an instruction manual. Can you believe it?

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Bonnie Milligan, a star of the musical "Kimberly Akimbo," has been the lucky occupant of a rent-controlled apartment in Manhattan for 15 years.
Bonnie Milligan, an actress known for her vocal range and belting voice, shares a snug rental on the Upper West Side with a college friend who is also a performer. Ms. Milligan's bedroom is sufficiently small that she has to leave to change her mind. The kitchen and living room are pretty much one and the same space.
But the 30-something Ms. Milligan, a Tony nominee for her performance as the shifty, shiftless Aunt Debra in the musical "Kimberly Akimbo" (the awards ceremony is scheduled for June 11), isn't much for trafficking in discouraging words. Thus, she quickly points out her building's admirable location (handy to both Lincoln Center and a subway stop) and eagerly enumerates the desirable features of the apartment complex. A concierge across the street "collects packages for us, which is a huge thing," she said. There's a washer and dryer in the basement, and workout equipment in the courtyard.
As for the apartment itself: Ta-da! It's rent controlled.
"Over the course of the 15 years I've been here, it has gone up $ 550 in total," Ms. Milligan said.
Bonnie Milligan, 30-something
Occupation: Actress
Two's company: "My apartment mate and I have both gone out of town on jobs. I've been here alone, or she's been here alone, and we think, 'I really like the comfort of living with my best friend.' That's the long and short of it."
"We have all these amenities that would mean a skyrocketing price if we went elsewhere," she added, while declining to reveal her current rent. "Every time we've looked somewhere else in the neighborhood, we end up thinking that we might as well stay here."
And even if the Tony nomination is great and validating -- and, perhaps, a sign of lucrative things to come -- Ms. Milligan knows that the one certain thing in an actor's life is uncertainty. She made her Broadway debut in 2018 in "Head Over Heels," a musical that combined a Renaissance pastoral romance with the music of the Go-Go's. When it closed (barely five months after it opened), she had a year of readings and workshops, and "maybe a demo here and there, and I think maybe I shot a little TV," she said. "But I was hustling to get money for my bills."
Ms. Milligan comes honestly by her modest housing expectations.
She spent her formative years in a double-wide trailer behind her grandparents' home in central Illinois. "I had friends -- not even the mean kids, but friends -- who would say, 'We love coming to your house. Yours is the only one with license plates and taillights.' Those little jabs were hard," said Ms. Milligan who, after her parents' divorce, moved with her mother to a small house in northwestern Ohio.
Next stop, in 2007: Manhattan.
"I'd been there before on some trips as a teenager, and I just knew it was where I wanted to be to do musical theater. I was a small-town girl, but New York was always my heart," said Ms. Milligan, who initially sublet space in a three-bedroom, fifth-floor walk-up on the Upper East Side. "During my first six months in New York, I lived in every one of the bedrooms as people came and went."
She found stability when some college pals invited her to take over a recently vacated room in their three-bedroom Upper West Side apartment. "That was February 2008, and I've been here ever since," she said.
When one of the original residents moved out some years ago, a procession of subletters took over the third bedroom. "I got to a point where I said, 'Let's not do this anymore,"' Ms. Milligan recalled. Now that spare room is an office.
By necessity, the apartment is light on furniture. A blue love seat in the kitchen/living room is the spot to sit, eat or watch television. A small bookcase near the front door holds Ms. Milligan's alphabetized DVD collection of 1960s and '70s television series, most snagged from the $ 5 bin at Target. Another small bookcase with more DVDs -- "Taxi," "The Dick Van Dyke Show"-- sits in her bedroom, along with the bed and bureau from her teenage room in Ohio.
The tidily arrayed magnets on the front and side of the refrigerator clue visitors in to her heroes in the most compact way possible. Her beloved maternal grandmother, Betty Jean Meador, loved cardinals; thus, the cardinal magnet. There are Lucille Ball and Gilda Radner magnets, "because both of them were influences on me," Ms. Milligan said.
Doris Day also figures prominently. "I've been a huge fan since I was a kid," she said. "I used to take my allowance money and go on eBay and buy magnets from her movies."
At its most essential level, the apartment is mixture of where Ms. Milligan came from and where she is. The quilt on her bed and the Afghan slung over the sofa once belonged to her grandmother. So did a tin in the living room and the jewelry box atop the bureau. "We were very close, so I like to have a lot of her around," Ms. Milligan said.
The bureau is also home to a small stuffed teddy bear previously owned by Ms. Milligan's father, a pastor and talented singer, as well as a photo of Ms. Milligan's mother and grandmother. Nearby is a hatbox that was a prop in "Head Over Heels," and a small wooden chest that a friend's grandfather made for Ms. Milligan as an opening night gift.
The bedroom walls, on the other hand, tell the story of Ms. Milligan's life in New York -- show posters, fan art, awards, caricatures by Justin "Squigs" Robertson, a theatrical illustrator, and a drawing, commissioned by a friend, of a raccoon garbed in the same warehouse-store vest that Ms. Milligan sports in the last moments of "Kimberly Akimbo."
"My friend and I love raccoons in general, and we've always believed that Aunt Debra is an absolute raccoon," she said.
On the morning the Tony nominations came out, three of Ms. Milligan's college friends came over to watch the announcement on CBS, bringing along coffee, bagels and champagne (just in case there was reason to pop a cork).
"It was really beautiful being with dear friends that I met at the Ohio State University," Ms. Milligan said. "They've known me for, like, 20 years. So it was my past and present all together in one place. And that's the whole thing of my apartment."

How Detectives Broke a Logjam In Four Student Deaths in Idaho: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the weeks after four University of Idaho students were found slaughtered in a house near campus last November, a growing roster of investigators desperately searching for answers had yet to identify a suspect or even find the murder weapon.
Publicly, the authorities were assuring worried residents in the small college town that they were making progress. Privately, they were exhausting their prospects, scouring through the backgrounds of those with the thinnest possible connections to the case.
Through the first two weeks of December, investigators put some of their focus on classmates of the victims; they also widened the search to examine a man in another state who had been known to send harassing messages to women but had visited Idaho only twice in his life. They looked at a woman previously charged with assaults in the region. They looked at a man once accused of wielding a knife. They looked at sex offenders. They looked at a white supremacist. Each turned out to be a dead end.
Then, after spending weeks sifting through an array of evidence that seemed to lead nowhere, investigators announced an arrest in late December on the other side of the country: Bryan Kohberger, a Ph.D. student from a nearby university. He was identified only after investigators turned to an advanced method of DNA analysis that had rarely been used in active murder investigations.
The story of how dozens of officers from local, state and federal agencies took the quadruple murder investigation into extraordinary territory is only now becoming more apparent, through recently obtained records and interviews with people familiar with the investigation who discussed key details that emerged before the issuance of a gag order in the case.
The case has shown the degree to which law enforcement investigators have come to rely on the digital footprints that ordinary Americans leave in nearly every facet of their lives. Online shopping, car sales, carrying a cellphone, drives along city streets and amateur genealogy all played roles in an investigation that was solved, in the end, as much through technology as traditional sleuthing.
Now indicted on four counts of murder, Mr. Kohberger has declined to enter a plea but contended previously through his lawyer that he would be exonerated. Investigators have yet to detail a possible motive: To this day, family members of the victims remain unaware of any prior connections that the accused killer had with the four young people who were killed.
The process of identifying and arresting a suspect took over six weeks -- weeks of increasing frustration and painstaking examination of evidence as the community pushed for answers.
The first 911 call came in around noon, some seven hours after the murders. Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, had been stabbed to death overnight in their bedrooms. Initially, the Moscow Police Department described the attack as "targeted" and assured residents that there was no risk to the public. But with no indication of who had committed the attack or why, the authorities eventually backtracked.
"We cannot say that there is no threat to the community," the police chief, James Fry, said at a news conference on Nov. 16, three days after the killings.
The department, which had only a few dozen officers, enlisted the Idaho State Police and the F.B.I. to help, bringing in dozens of additional investigators. Forensic teams processed evidence from the bedrooms, snapped photos around the home's back door and hunted for footprints; others searched for surveillance video from around town.
A week after the killings, records show, investigators were on the lookout for a certain type of vehicle: Nissan Sentras from the model years 2019 to 2023. Quietly, they ran down details on thousands of such vehicles, including the owners' addresses, license plate numbers and the color of each sedan.
But further scrutiny of the video footage produced more clarity, and on Nov. 25 the police in Moscow asked law enforcement agencies to look for a different type of car with a similar shape: white Hyundai Elantras from the model years 2011 to 2013.
Just across the state border, at Washington State University, campus police officers began looking through their records for Elantras registered there. Among those they found was one registered to Mr. Kohberger, who had moved to the area earlier in 2022 to pursue a Ph.D. in criminology.
They checked Mr. Kohberger's car more closely, according to a court affidavit, including visiting the parking lot near his apartment in the early morning hours of Nov. 29. But the vehicle was a 2015 model, not the earlier models being sought in Moscow.
The next day, records show, investigators in Moscow were also looking closely at another vehicle: Ms. Goncalves's car. She had purchased a 2015 Range Rover in the days before her death. Detectives gathered information on the registration, history and legal owners, clearly interested in the history of who had owned the car. But once again, the information provided few answers.
With students at the University of Idaho preparing for final exams, there was a permanent sense of apprehension in the air, as people began locking their doors, acquiring pepper spray and asking on social media how such a brazen killer could remain undetected for so long in a town that had not seen a murder in seven years.
The hunt broadened as investigators vacuumed up more records and data. They had already sought cellphone data for all phones that pinged cell towers within a half-mile of the victims' house from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., according to search warrant filings. They collected victims' bank records, email correspondence and social media account data.
On Dec. 5, detectives made a new request for surveillance video, seeking all footage recorded on U.P.S. delivery trucks in the days before and after the killings.
The next day, after getting back data on Ms. Goncalves's account on the Tinder dating app, detectives asked for details on 19 specific account-holders, including their locations, credit card information and any "private images, pictures or videos" associated with the accounts.
The request allowed the inquiry to go much broader than an ordinary search for information, using a single warrant to target 19 different people, said Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
"You couldn't get one warrant to search 19 houses," he said.
Investigators were also working with a key piece of evidence: a Ka-Bar knife sheath, branded with a U.S. Marine Corps logo, that had been found next to two of the victims. They initially began looking for local stores that may have sold the weapon, and then fanned out.
A request to Amazon sought the order histories of account holders who had purchased such knives. A follow-up request to eBay focused on a series of specific users, seeking their purchase histories. Some had connections to the area -- including one in Idaho and two in Washington State -- while others were from far away, including an account in Japan. Because of redactions, it is unclear if Mr. Kohberger's name came up in those records.
The overall data track was growing enormous, demonstrating the extensive breadth of data on consumer platforms that can be made accessible to law enforcement agencies when they are at the stage of hunting for bread crumbs.
"You could say this is uncharted territory," Mr. Kerr said. "They are novel legal questions when there are so many records out there."
At the same time, DNA from the scene was being processed. Forensic teams had examined the knife sheath and found DNA that did not belong to any of the inhabitants of the house. They ran the sample through the F.B.I.'s database, which contains millions of DNA profiles of past criminal offenders, but according to three people briefed on the case, they did not get a match.
At that point, investigators decided to try genetic genealogy, a method that until now has been used primarily to solve cold cases, not active murder investigations. Among the growing number of genealogy websites that help people trace their ancestors and relatives via their own DNA, some allow users to select an option that permits law enforcement to compare crime scene DNA samples against the websites' data.
A distant cousin who has opted into the system can help investigators building a family tree from crime scene DNA to triangulate and identify a potential perpetrator of a crime. In one of the best-known uses of genealogy in solving a cold case, detectives in 2018 were able to arrest a suspect in a string of rapes and murders years before in California that had been attributed to the so-called Golden State Killer.
Once a suspect is identified, a direct genetic comparison can be used as confirmation before making an arrest.
With few formal regulations, the use of mass genealogy databases has raised concerns about privacy and whether limits should be placed on how the method is used. But authorities across the country say they have found potential in the system to produce leads that are unattainable through traditional investigative efforts.
Barbara Rae-Venter, a genealogy consultant who worked on the Golden State Killer case, said there was now growing interest in using genealogical DNA not just in cold cases but also in active crime investigations.
"That is why the Idaho case is so interesting," she said.
To do the genealogical analysis, the Idaho State Police contracted with a private company, Othram, in Texas, which had a lab able to produce a more extensive DNA profile from the knife sheath than the state lab was set up to examine.
F.B.I. personnel worked with the profile that Othram had produced, according to two people familiar with the investigation, spending days building out a family tree that began with a distant relative.
By the morning of Dec. 19, records show, investigators had a name: Bryan Kohberger. He had a white Elantra. He was a student at a university eight miles from the murder scene.
Mr. Kohberger was already out of town, his semester complete. He had driven home with his father to Pennsylvania, stopped twice by the police along the way for what officers said was tailgating. Just as agents began to scour his background more thoroughly, he had been terminated from his position as a teaching assistant, after what was described as altercations with a professor.
On Dec. 23, investigators sought and received Mr. Kohberger's cellphone records. The results added more to their suspicions: His phone was moving around in the early morning hours of Nov. 13, but was disconnected from cell networks -- perhaps turned off -- in the two hours around when the killings occurred.
Four days later, agents in Pennsylvania managed to retrieve some trash from Mr. Kohberger's family residence, sending the material to the Idaho State Police forensic lab. Checking it against their original DNA profile, the lab was able to reach a game-changing conclusion: The DNA in the trash belonged to a close relative of whoever had left DNA on the knife sheath.
Mr. Kohberger was arrested on Dec. 30.
"We have an individual in custody who committed these horrible crimes, and I do believe our community is safe," the police chief, Mr. Fry, announced. "But we still do need to be vigilant, right?"

The next day, after getting back data on Goncalves’ account on the Tinder dating app, detectives asked for details on 19 specific account holders, including their locations, credit card information and any “private images, pictures or videos” associated with the accounts.
The request allowed the inquiry to go much broader than an ordinary search for information, using a single warrant to target 19 people, said Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
“You couldn’t get one warrant to search 19 houses,” he said.
Investigators were also working with a key piece of evidence: a Ka-Bar knife sheath, branded with a U.S. Marine Corps logo, that had been found next to two of the victims. They initially began looking for local stores that may have sold the weapon, and then fanned out.
A request to Amazon sought the order histories of account holders who had purchased such knives. A follow-up request to eBay focused on a series of specific users, seeking their purchase histories. Some had connections to the area — including one in Idaho and two in Washington state — while others were from far away, including an account in Japan. Because of redactions, it is unclear if Kohberger’s name came up in those records.
The overall data track was growing enormous, demonstrating the extensive breadth of data on consumer platforms that can be made accessible to law enforcement agencies when they are at the stage of hunting for breadcrumbs.
“You could say this is uncharted territory,” Kerr said. “They are novel legal questions when there are so many records out there.”
At the same time, DNA from the scene was being processed. Forensic teams had examined the knife sheath and found DNA that did not belong to any of the inhabitants of the house. They ran the sample through the FBI’s database, which contains millions of DNA profiles of past criminal offenders, but according to three people briefed on the case, they did not get a match.
At that point, investigators decided to try genetic genealogy, a method that until now has been used primarily to solve cold cases, not active murder investigations. Among the growing number of genealogy websites that help people trace their ancestors and relatives via their own DNA, some allow users to select an option that permits law enforcement to compare crime scene DNA samples against the websites’ data.
A distant cousin who has opted into the system can help investigators building a family tree from crime scene DNA to triangulate and identify a potential perpetrator of a crime. In one of the best-known uses of genealogy in solving a cold case, detectives in 2018 were able to arrest a suspect in a string of rapes and murders years before in California that had been attributed to the so-called Golden State Killer.
Once a suspect is identified, a direct genetic comparison can be used as confirmation before making an arrest.
With few formal regulations, the use of mass genealogy databases has raised concerns about privacy and whether limits should be placed on how the method is used. But authorities across the country say they have found potential in the system to produce leads that are unattainable through traditional investigative efforts.
Barbara Rae-Venter, a genealogy consultant who worked on the Golden State Killer case, said there was now growing interest in using genealogical DNA not just in cold cases but also in active crime investigations.
“That is why the Idaho case is so interesting,” she said.
To do the genealogical analysis, the Idaho State Police contracted with a private company, Othram, in Texas, which had a lab able to produce a more extensive DNA profile from the knife sheath than the state lab was set up to examine.
FBI personnel worked with the profile that Othram had produced, according to two people familiar with the investigation, spending days building out a family tree that began with a distant relative.
By the morning of Dec. 19, records show, investigators had a name: Bryan Kohberger. He had a white Elantra. He was a student at a university 8 miles from the scene of the killings.
Kohberger was already out of town, his semester complete. He had driven home with his father to Pennsylvania, stopped twice by police along the way for what officers said was tailgating. Just as agents began to scour his background more thoroughly, he had been terminated from his position as a teaching assistant, after what was described as altercations with a professor.
On Dec. 23, investigators sought and received Kohberger’s cellphone records. The results added more to their suspicions: His phone was moving around in the early morning hours of Nov. 13, but was disconnected from cell networks — perhaps turned off — in the two hours around when the killings occurred.
Four days later, agents in Pennsylvania managed to retrieve some trash from Kohberger’s family residence, sending the material to the Idaho State Police forensic lab. Checking it against the original DNA profile, the lab was able to reach a game-changing conclusion: The DNA in the trash belonged to a close relative of whomever had left DNA on the knife sheath.
Kohberger was arrested Dec. 30.
“We have an individual in custody who committed these horrible crimes, and I do believe our community is safe,” the police chief, Fry, announced. “But we still do need to be vigilant, right?”

Full text: Tech nerds see the current moment for artificial intelligence as similar to the time when the Netscape browser was released, stirring innovation.
/nĕt-scāpe mō-mĕnt/
A term used to describe when an under-the-hood technology that was being developed for many years is suddenly seen and recognized as disruptive and potentially revolutionary.
As Silicon Valley has been gripped by a frenzy over artificial intelligence, some techies have been trying to put this latest tech boom into perspective. One way to think about it is as A.I.'s "Netscape moment."
Here's what that means.
Essentially, there are parallels between today's fervor for A.I.-powered chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard and the excitement over the Netscape browser from the 1990s. Both allowed people to recognize the possibilities around an existing technology, leading to new innovation.
The Netscape browser was one of the first tools that helped people easily surf the World Wide Web. While the internet had been around since the 1960s, in its early days it was used mostly by academics, and it was difficult for anyone else to gain access to it.
But Netscape Navigator, developed by Marc Andreessen and released in 1994, let the general public see and smoothly browse web pages -- quickly leading to the understanding that the internet could be used by us all. That spawned the late-1990s dot-com boom, with the establishment of websites like eBay and Amazon, eventually giving rise to the internet we know today.
Chatbots have similarly made people realize the power of A.I., a technology that has been in development for decades, in fits and starts. When ChatGPT debuted last year and people tapped it to generate business plans, screenplays, poems and more, many began comprehending how A.I. could apply to their daily lives -- and also disrupt what they were doing.
Arvind Krishna, the chief executive of IBM, explained it at a speaking series last month at Duke's Fuqua School of Business.
"I kind of think of ChatGPT as doing the Netscape moment," he said. He also said that it may seem like chatbots were "overnight wonders, but there has been 30 years of hard, grinding work."
In the past few months, Microsoft, Google, Meta and others have pushed harder into the A.I. race. Venture capitalists are pouring money into A.I. start-ups. And companies, universities and schools have realized they must adjust how they do things because of this A.I. wave.
Some techies have likened the A.I. boom to an "iPhone moment," referring to how the Apple device, which was introduced in 2007, led to an avalanche of mobile apps. But to nerds like me, that's not quite right because the iPhone was a hardware trigger, rather than an under-the-hood technology like a browser or chatbot. That's why a "Netscape moment" seems a more apt analogy.

Our Endless, Absurd Quest To Get the Very Best: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Let me tell you about my friend Dan Symons. There is a kind of person who finds the idea of seeking out "the best" incredibly enticing, on an almost spiritual level. The kind of person who genuinely enjoys perusing articles like "the nine best hair dryers of 2023," who is overcome with clammy dread at the idea of drinking in a bar with only a four-star rating on Google, who, in order to plan a weekend getaway, requires a prolonged and extensive operation that involves several spreadsheets. You know the type. Maybe you even are the type.
Dan is that kind of person. He is also from California (perhaps not a coincidence that this is the home of both the eternal quest for self-optimization and the internet ecosystem that underpins the explosion in ratings culture), works in tech and has a keen appreciation for the finer things in life. He is known throughout our friend group for his fastidiously curated lists of restaurants, bars and even specific menu items; his near refusal to venture into establishments that are anything less than excellent; and his hours spent trawling reviews for everything from mini-fridges to trail shoes. When I questioned him on a rumor that I heard recently, that he had been freezing packets of "the best butter" to bring back from France, he confirmed it was true.
Dan may be an extreme case, but a dampened version of his instinct permeates our culture. If it didn't, the raft of articles solemnly decreeing this year's superlative vacuum cleaners simply would not exist. I had been wondering about where this culture of ratings and rankings came from and how it came to take over our lives; how even the least exciting consumer choices are framed in terms of elusive state-of-the-art options; and, conversely, how necessarily subjective things (novels, colleges, where to live) are increasingly presented as consumer choices for which there is an objective "best."
I thought Dan could shed some light on what the pursuit of "the best" really means. But when I asked him, what I learned was that the motivation behind his "quest for the best" wasn't what I expected. It wasn't about snobbery, or even, really, self-optimization.
"I think the really important thing to me -- which is probably not a healthy thing -- is I want to make sure the people I'm with have the best time possible," Dan told me. "And this comes down to not just going to the restaurant, but even ordering as well. Like, 'Are you sure you want to get that dish? Based on the other things we're getting, is that the right thing to get?' It extends through the whole meal." To me it actually sounds, instead, as if Dan is trying to guarantee something closer to happiness. But can happiness really be found in a packet of butter?
Rankings, of course, are nothing new. Sight and Sound has put out a list of greatest films every 10 years since 1952. The U.S. News & World Report college rankings were first published in 1983. (It will probably surprise nobody that this year's top three are Princeton, M.I.T. and Harvard.) Rolling Stone released its first list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" in 2003. Some version of the "hottest new restaurants of the year" could be found in local newspapers and magazines for decades -- not to mention the best dentists, doctors, schools. These have always provoked conversation, backlash, letters to the editor.
But over the past 20 years, the internet gave us more and more ways to make ratings of our own, rather than just objecting to or agreeing with those handed down by editors. Online reviews first appeared around 1999, on sites like eBay. Yelp was created in 2004 to help people find good local businesses. Google reviews followed in 2007. These are now among the first places where people look when trying to find practically any business or service. And participating in these rankings can feel like one of the demands of the responsible consumer: If you go to an emerging small business, it's now normal for someone to ask you to help it out by filling out a Google review. (I myself have left giddy tributes to my beloved hairdresser across the internet.)
Listicles proliferated as a kind of content that was easy to produce, easy to attract attention to, easy to sell ads against. In the heyday of BuzzFeed, the listicle tended to take the form of "50 times baby pandas were the cutest," but with the advent of affiliate links, the likes of New York magazine's The Strategist and The New York Times's very own Wirecutter use them to rank all manner of consumer goods. The best easy-to-assemble tents, the 30 softest midrange nightgowns, the 17 smoothest razors under $ 50, the top seven waterproof briefcases.
There are best-of lists of less concrete things, too: the 100 best novelists of the past 100 years; rich lists; the 30 under 30. It's everywhere. And it can start to feel like the logical way to organize even highly personal information.
Some of us have even started listicle-ing ourselves. I recently spoke to my trusted adviser on all things Gen Z, my brother Ryan, to get an idea of how ratings culture has influenced those who have grown up completely immersed in it. It's worse than I suspected.
Ryan told me about a recent conversation at his workplace. Over lunch, he and his colleagues were sharing stories about the proliferation of spreadsheets and ratings systems. One of the women described a friend who kept a spreadsheet with her own personalized ratings for everything from TV shows to recipes. "But probably the most jarring one was one she had made for her sexual partners," Ryan said. "Most people around the table were kind of aghast." But then another woman said she does the same thing.
Even for those of us who don't relate to Dan Symons -- much less keep a spreadsheet of everyone we have slept with -- rankings and lists still have a use: They help us make sense of our impossibly vast consumer landscape.
There is a way of talking about the psychedelic, hysterical effect of the information glut produced by the internet that tends to exaggerate the nefariousness of certain elements -- like repeatedly being shown advertisements for things you've already bought -- while minimizing how chaotic and messy it all feels. You could, for example, say that these lists are a product of "ratings derangement syndrome" and then say something like "In a world where our tech overlords manipulate their distraction vortex to shovel us into the slobbering maw of capitalism, ratings offer the illusion of taking back a semblance of control."
Maybe. But to me, anyway, the experience of shopping for a hair dryer online feels less like being a pawn in a Matrix-esque mind-control operation and more like being trapped inside a box of plastic toys that have all been wound up so they constantly chatter and clatter against one another. The reality is I just want to spend as little time as possible in that box, while also hopefully buying something that won't break the second time I use it. Best-of lists and rankings can seem like a simple solution to this problem.
There are a lot of areas where people don't feel as if they have expertise, and ratings "get rid of that feeling of not being competent," Rick Larrick, a professor of management and organization at Duke University, told me.
Dr. Larrick has studied consumers' tendency to trust rankings and, in particular, to chase "the best." He has found that people put a strange amount of faith in this. "As soon as you put a rank on things," even something like toilet cleaner, "people's preference for the top-ranked one increases substantially, by around 20 percent," he said. "There is something about the comfort of using the simple differentiation between one and two. The ranks make it easy to make the decision, and then there's some feeling to being able to clearly tell yourself that you got the best one."
I'd venture that not many people (possibly not any people) are able to tell the difference between the top toilet cleaner and the second best -- or even the fifth or sixth. This suggests that the appeal of the best is not really about a simple difference in the quality of the product, but more about a feeling: of reassurance, maybe; of having won, having got the right thing.
Dan's proclivities would place him squarely as "a maximizer," a category of consumer invented by Barry Schwartz, an emeritus professor of psychology at Swarthmore College and the author of "The Paradox of Choice," which examines the detrimental side of endless consumer options. Dr. Schwartz defines people who are happy to settle for something that will probably be pretty good (a restaurant with above average, but not excellent, ratings; the third song they come to on a playlist; the midpriced toaster on the first page of Amazon) as "satisficers" and those who search exhaustively for the best version as "maximizers." (Many people who are generally satisficers will have certain things that bring out their inner maximizer. In other words, we all have an inner Dan Symons.)
When I started thinking about this idea of bests, it was through the prism of my own disposition, that of a settler, someone of the "just get one that works" school of thought. When I see a broken toaster, I see an annoying problem to be solved as quickly as possible. But Dan sees an opportunity: to get something that works a little faster, which would perhaps be more aesthetically pleasing, or run more smoothly, or not break so easily, and thus, to make life just that tiny bit better, with the only cost being a small investment in time spent doing research.
But these impulses have more in common than it seems. Both are attempts to solve the overwhelming consumer landscape facilitated by the internet. One (mine) is to try to engage with it as little as possible, essentially to run away and hide; the other is to greet the possibilities it offers with open arms, treating it as a challenge that can be won. One instinctively makes more sense to me, but then the other probably guarantees the better toaster. I wonder, though, if the better toaster promises something bigger. And in that case, can the better toaster ever really be enough? And what about when we're talking about something bigger, more significant, more subjective, more human than a toaster?
The people I know who broadly seem most content with their lives have adopted the satisficer's mind-set. When my hairdresser (a man of infinite wisdom) suggested I get a heat protection spray and I asked which one, he imparted some advice in this vein: "Oh, it doesn't really matter," he said. "Just don't spend £3, but don't spend £25 either." (The latter is the price of the brand the salon sells.) "Nobody really needs that. Spend around £7. That should be all right. Yes, always stick to the midrange. I should be a salesman!" He laughed. "Although not for the one we actually sell."
Dr. Schwartz goes further: He has found that those who are on the higher end of the maximizing scale not only have a harder time making decisions but also are less satisfied with the decisions they do make. They're also more likely to be borderline clinically depressed, he told me. "So it's really not doing anyone a favor," he said.
But the sensible attitude -- as obvious as it may sound -- can be hard to put into practice. Or maybe it's easier to put into practice with hair spray than it is with, say, a "perfect vacation" or the "optimal time to retire."
As I was thinking about all of this, I remembered a family vacation I went on when I was about 15, before seemingly everything was planned using smartphones and TripAdvisor. An elderly relative had saved up the money he was paid as a priest (I know, I grew up in Ireland) and gave it to my parents, who took us to Rome. My dad had meticulously plotted out our meals, but as we traipsed from restaurant to restaurant in the blazing heat, we repeatedly found that they were all closed: His guidebook was out of date; it was the height of summer and the city was dead. My dad would respond by having a meltdown in some piazza, then regain composure and select another guidebook recommendation. At the time, I found this maddening. I just wanted to eat something and then slink off to spend hours walking around and, perhaps, drink wine by a fountain near some Italian boys.
In hindsight, I have realized we were both after essentially the same thing: We both saw our trip as a rare opportunity, and we wanted to squeeze as much out of it as possible.
Out-of-date guidebooks are long gone, but many of us now take a "my dad in Rome" attitude to vacations -- fastidiously planning meals and excursions that can't possibly be missed, to insulate ourselves from the sense we might be wasting any of the experience. Spontaneity can feel risky when we all have constant, easy access to the internet, ostensibly a flawless, infinite guidebook. But we can forget that feeling -- happiness, smugness and satisfaction mixed with relief -- of finding something really great by accident.
It's true that searching long enough for something can make the fantasy version -- the version with which you'd be happy -- seem more and more perfect in the abstract, in such a way that it drifts farther and farther away. It's human nature to want more, and better. Indulging this instinct can push us toward better options, to a point, and from then on hopelessly feed a sense of want. I see this most vividly in online dating, where optimizing everyone's power to search for a partner seems to have caused more disappointment and loneliness than anything else.
It's a sentiment that has the folksy feel of a Sunday school teaching, but still, part of having a good life is learning to be happy with what you have. As Dr. Schwartz put it: "We mistakenly think it is a treasure hunt. And it's not a treasure hunt. It's more like treasure creation."
I find the sense of total directionlessness that is suggested by Googling something like "what is the best number of kids to have?" bizarre. But if people are earnestly using information like this to make their life choices, I would venture that this is because of a sense that those answers really do exist and the internet has made them easy to find. People have always felt lost, but the search for quantifiable, certified answers is now created by the existence of the answers themselves: a perfect number of wedding guests; the right place to live; the best age to be alive (it's 36). All suggest sureness in a world that feels confusing. It always has, but the answer to this perhaps used to be praying. That never guaranteed results.
The "perfect" restaurant means Dan will have the best time with his friends; for me, finding the perfect hairdresser (and yes, I do think he's perfect and I discovered him only after years of following disappointing recommendations) feels like a guarantee of optimum beauty and glamour.
As I talked to more and more people about the quest for the best, I realized that this seems to be true for most of them. One friend explained to me how the false promises of a sportswear brand's marketing exemplified the fruitlessness of a "quest for the best" anything -- only to disappear into another room and return with a freshly delivered pair of its leggings, to show me the false promises up close. Lots of people could be cynical about buying into the promise of a better, brighter life offered by the best version of something, while still sort of hoping it was true. This is not to say that we are powerless to resist a trap coldly set by capitalism or that adults can't engage rationally with marketing. But we all have our weaknesses and our fantasies.
Of course, the idea that a certain type of running leggings would make your life better is ridiculous. The same is true of tacos or mini-fridges -- or vacation sunsets. Or any other number of things which are perhaps only marginally different in quality or offer a difference we aren't sophisticated enough to appreciate.
When we grapple to exert control over these relatively small things, we are seeking to exert some agency over something that feels important to us. Because the idea of how little agency we really have is uncomfortable. No university will guarantee the best four years of your life or a dazzling career thereafter; you can be depressed at Harvard and then unemployed, living with your parents after you graduate. No "best city to retire in" will mean you don't end up divorced and lonely. Happiness is not a thing any amount of research or savvy will guarantee for us.
That's a scary thought. But this is a positive thing, too: Choosing the wrong thing doesn't have to mean the end of the world. In fact, it doesn't have to mean anything. Except whatever we want to make of it.

Newly Reviewed
'Bonnard: The Experience of Seeing'
Through May 26. Acquavella, 18 East 79th Street, Manhattan; 212-734-6300, acquavellagalleries.com.
A kaleidoscopic show of Pierre Bonnard's paintings at Acquavella overlaps with a more modest selection at Jill Newhouse Gallery nearby -- not bad for a practically hallucinatory painter who's been dead since 1947. Bonnard bridged Post-Impressionism and Modernism; he's famous for his colors, mind-bending and vertiginous, unfurling the full spectrum within scenes others might see as "white" or "blue."
Where Impressionists had their favorite cathedrals or lily pads, Bonnard's masterpieces came alive at home. Acquavella focuses on his later years, from the 1920s to 1940s, and showcases the wonders of simply laid tables and balanced baskets of fruit and fantastic landscapes rushing through the windows. "Dining Room on the Garden," 1934-35, on loan from the Guggenheim Museum, takes pride of place on the back wall: a purpling banquet, the feverishly blue-green sky through the French doors, the hay-toned walls overtaking the chairs, a figure.
There are portraits, too, including a periwinkle bath scene (one of Bonnard's specialties), where the red rug jostles the composition's peace, and an alluring, long nude from 1920, where the figure is one stripe up the canvas between vertical passages of mottled gold and chevroned blue. The still lifes? Abundant. The tablecloths? Ecstatic. The kinetics of Bonnard's compositions reside in the way objects and animals relate, appearing both detached and boundless. This is why he's a peerless painter of dachshunds, although here you'll need to settle for the lazier chocolate hues of "The Dining Room, Fruit and Basset Hounds." TRAVIS DIEHL
Uman
Through June 17. Nicola Vassell Gallery, 138 Tenth Avenue, Manhattan. 212-463-5160; nicolavassell.com.
In her first solo show at Nicola Vassell Gallery, the self-taught painter Uman, who was born in Somalia and now lives near Albany, pretty much takes the place over. On gallery walls painted deep green, purple or gold, she has mounted 15 enormous, vibrant, unremitting square paintings, each framed in a dark shadow box produced in her studio, and even more small drawings. (Not for nothing is the show titled "I Want Everything Now.") The paintings' colors are bold and saturated, and their textures range from slick, wet brushwork to the halting skitter of oil stick. Their forms mostly comprise circles, scribbles and squares, but also a smattering of eyes, flowers, suns, pointy teeth and ambiguous suggestions of intestines, chairs or vertebrae. The references are both cross-cultural and art-historical, but the effect, in general, leans toward the textile; one yellow canvas, divided into a triangular lattice by green and red lines, is also sewn together from triangular scraps. On another, what looks like a transparent sea horse rears over a bottle clearly labeled "Eau de Parfum."
In a way, though, Uman is a minimalist. Her gestures, like the schematic flowers that let her claim a toehold in figuration, are always distinctly efficient. Canvases may be covered edge to edge, but the paint application is thin, and the moment an explosive effect is achieved, she moves on to the next one. WILL HEINRICH
Sylvia Plimack Mangold
Through June 3. 125 Newbury, 395 Broadway, Manhattan, 212-371-5242, 125newbury.com.
"I discovered the secret of the sea in meditation upon a dewdrop," wrote the Lebanese-born painter and poet Khalil Gibran. Sylvia Plimack Mangold approaches painting the same way. Fifteen works on view at 125 Newbury all depict a single maple tree living outside her studio in Washingtonville, N.Y., that she has been painting for decades.
Many of the paintings here are titled "Leaves in the Wind" and capture a green-filled summer rendered, close-up, in lush but no-nonsense brushstrokes reminiscent of Fairfield Porter or Édouard Manet -- as well as Claude Monet and his sharply framed compositions of waterlilies. Other works, titled "Winter Maple," function like dusty-blue skyscapes forked by leafless brown-gray branches.
The "secret" of the tree, of course, is that it is ever-changing, and hence produces infinite variations. (If, in fact, it is the same tree. We have to trust Mangold on this -- although Magritte's famous 1929 painting "The Treachery of Images," commonly known as "Ceci n'est pas une pipe" or "This is not a pipe," offered a blunt lesson on how truth operates in painting.)
In Mangold's hands, parts become wholes and the exhibition a master class in synecdoche: the tree is the forest; the painter a human representative negotiating with the natural world. In an age of restless movement and too much information, the practice of painting a single tree also becomes a profound, even radical act of mindfulness, meditation and care. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Beverly Fishman
Through June 3. Miles McEnery Gallery, 515 West 22nd Street, Manhattan; 212-445-0051; milesmcenery.com.
The artist Beverly Fishman has been thinking about the cure for what ails us for the last 40 years. Her candy-colored constructions exist somewhere between painting, sculpture and bad trip: uppers and downers pulsating in happy, fluorescent hues -- a medicine cabinet stocked with remedies for being human.
The new work here, continuing her series of faceted, urethane-shellacked wood forms that protrude from the wall (a funny play on the idea of "relief"), are a workaround to figuration -- about the body but never depicting it, geometric abstraction as a feint to talk about contemporary culture, and what we ingest to cope with it. They merge Frank Stella's hard-edged syncopation with Southern California's Finish Fetish movement, resulting in lustrous surfaces with an electric hum and smooth cast, like Everlasting Gobstoppers dipped in car paint. Each pill is rendered in concentric bands so that they resemble restless, polychromatic irises, or Wayne Thiebaud's glowing confections, if Thiebaud painted sherbert-ringed icons of existential pain.
Only their titles, doubling as diagnoses, reveal their nefariousness, as in "Untitled (Osteoporosis, Abortion, Depression, Anxiety, Birth Control)," 2023: healing as dictated by the medical-industrial complex, the promise of a quick fix and the drug dependency that promise has encouraged.
"Four help you through the night, help to minimize your plight," Mick Jagger sings on "Mother's Little Helper," the Stones' buoyant tune about a housewife developing a Valium habit. Since then, the pharmacological spectrum has only become more florid. That gives Fishman an inexhaustible pill box, her dosages calibrated to symptoms that never let up. MAX LAKIN
Last Chance
Michael McGrath
Through May 19. Crossing Art, 559 West 23rd Street, Manhattan, 212-359-4333, crossingart.com.
The artist Michael McGrath, who is based in Rhinebeck, in the Hudson Valley, paints what might be called the emoji landscape: screaming flowers; surprised-looking insects and trees. Scattered, wallpaper-like, across canvases whose titles nod to gods, witches and seasonal magic spells, his show "Moon Riot" at Crossing Art thrums with laid-back spiritualist energy.
McGrath's work took a radical turn a couple of years ago. (I discovered him on Instagram.) He was painting pleasingly anodyne landscapes and dark figures in the vein of Edvard Munch, and suddenly his work exploded with Day-Glo color and singing plants, unmoored in their compositions. Rather than serious or apocalyptic, his work is warm and funny, like folk art or children's drawings, and complemented by titles like "Intro to Hunting Gods," "Spring Training for Witches," "Redesigning Ghost Systems" and "Weekend Conference for Moons and Tiny Vampires."
The show includes a few missteps: It's overhung, and I could live without the fake-fur yeti figures that feel more like theme park mascots than sculpture. McGrath's work is refreshing, though, because it materializes the wonder of walking in the woods and a deeper sense that the world, minus humans, will be OK; everything regenerates, as it does in Thomas Cole's 19th-century Hudson River School masterpiece series "The Course of Empire" (1833-1836), which might be the first American paintings warning of the Anthropocene. McGrath has channeled something: maybe spirits, maybe gods, but mostly the anti-artifice of so-called outsider artists, who are plugged into a different frequency. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
'Kanten 観展: The Limits of History'
Through May 20. Apexart, 291 Church Street, Manhattan; 212-431-5270, apexart.org.
Beginning in the late 19th century, Japan amassed an empire that extended far beyond its contemporary borders. It was dismantled after the country's surrender in World War II -- but just because something is over doesn't mean it's forgotten. The exhibition "Kanten 観展: The Limits of History," curated by Eimi Tagore-Erwin, uses the work of eight artists and historical propaganda postcards to trace the scars left by imperial Japan.
In his photo series "Torii," Motoyuki Shitamichi documents Shinto gates that were once installed to mark the empire and now stand in other countries. The pictures show how the gates have been incorporated into their surroundings, becoming mundane but haunting remnants of the past.
Bontaro Dokuyama demonstrates how nationalist legacies live on in people. His video "My Anthem" (2019) features interviews with Taiwanese elders who can still recall the militaristic songs they had to memorize as children in a school choir. Scenes of them wearing uniforms and singing are both funny and sad.
My favorite piece, "Making a Perfect Donut" (2019), leans into humor as a tool for repair. The video features the duo Kyun-Chome trying to bridge the gap between Japanese locals and U.S. military personnel on Okinawa Island. They do so by enlisting people to make Japanese and American doughnuts on either side of a military fence and then put the two together: The small, roundish Japanese doughnut sort of fits, imperfectly, into the American one's hole. Their absurd quest becomes a metaphor for finding human-scale ways to navigate geopolitical complexity. JILLIAN STEINHAUER
Harris Rosenblum
Through May 20, Sara's, 2 East Broadway, third floor, Manhattan; saras.world.
What do preppers, gamers and religionists have in common? Not least, a taste for magical objects. With "Inorganic Demons," the Massachusetts-based artist Harris Rosenblum draws out the overlapping aesthetics of several contemporary subcultures, from primitive survivalists on Instagram to practitioners of the tabletop role-playing game "Warhammer." Laughably big, lumpy anime swords hang from the rafters; thus arrayed, the gallery, an unfinished loft in Chinatown, has the air of a LARPer's treasure room. Weaponry and relics include "Mourning Bracelet (For Hatsune)," 2022, a thin braid of cyan fibers from a manga cosplay wig; and "Knife," a World War II-style blade delicately displayed in a case lined with pink camouflage satin.
These are the accessories of subcultures that, maybe more than most, rely on fantasy. Several sculptures take the form of biblical paraphernalia. There's "The Sacrificial Lamb," a hollow statue patched together from disturbing, spongelike chunks of resin; and "Censer (Mechanical Squonk Mod)" made from PC parts and vaping components -- a peek into the sympathetic cults of customizable smoking and gaming gear. Rosenblum dedicates special attention to materials, the way a splinter of wood or bone proves the lives of the saints. Today, the rites of devout nerds involve PCs and fast internet, nicotine and fast food. In "Earth and New Earth Miku," one Hatsune figurine is 3-D printed, another made of clay from a Wendy's construction site. It takes some imagination to see past the crudeness of the objects to the magnificence of the beliefs they anchor. TRAVIS DIEHL
Marcelo Pombo
Through May 21.‌ ‌ Barro‌, 25 Peck Slip, Manhattan; 646-642-2625, barro.cc‌‌
The Argentine artist Marcelo Pombo is deviant in the best way: He depicts human sexuality as acts of speculation and ingenuity. Barro gallery's "Artisanal Conceptualism: Starting Point" offers the 1980s and '90s work of Pombo, who had fled the Argentine dictatorship for Brazil to avoid conscription in the Falklands War. This is half of the two-part exhibition -- Pombo's "Dibujos de San Pablo" ("The São Paulo Drawings") made in 1982 -- portraying human figures with bird bills or snouts like mice, or sex organs in the place of heads. These figures are engaged in all manner of gazing and wanton bodily exploration. It's utterly refreshing to see sexual relations as pansexual instead of expectedly heteronormative, or even rigidly homosexual. Using animal figures as surrogates, Pombo makes two human-bird hybrid creatures with wet beaks fondling each other ("Untitled 1982") intensely erotic, and curious.
Simultaneously Pombo uses this vocabulary of surrealism to make the terror of that time palpable. He draws a bird-man bleeding in a street from what are likely two bullet wounds, a dog and two witnesses weeping for this loss.
The other half contains everyday objects such as curtains and mosquito nets decorated as if Pombo insisted on recognizing that beauty often holds hands with tragedy. And his drawings of textiles, for example, the one with the knitting needles, "(1) ST," is so realistic I want to touch the paper. And that is the key to this work: the desire to touch and to come to know by touching. SEPH RODNEY
Arthur Dove
Through May 25. Alexandre, 25 East 73rd Street, Manhattan; 212-755-2828, alexandregallery.com.
The unmissable first full survey in a quarter century of the great American modernist painter Arthur Dove (1880--1946) is a swoony, museum-weight exhibition compressed into an Upper East Side gallery the size of a one-bedroom apartment. With 40 works, more than half of them paintings, all on loan from private collections, the show deftly sketches Dove's leaping, jolting career trajectory from Manhattan magazine illustrator, to Paris Impressionist, to fully abstract painter, some say the first such in the United States.
What he was for sure was American Modernism's great visual Transcendentalist. His images of molten rain clouds and God's-eye sunrises are views of the natural world as Thoreau might have seen and, more important, felt it. Dove always said that the meteorology -- the "sensation of light" -- he painted was a personal, intuitive one. And only somewhat more objective were his depictions of forces he saw as threats to that light: images of derricks, freight cars and cinder barges that evoked a spreading plague of industry and pollution.
Dove's art, despite its exultations, is tough and complex, as is clear at a glance through the splendid catalogue raisonné by Debra Bricker Balken. And although his reputation grew steadily in the New York art world, that world wasn't the one he really cared about. For years he lived in a sailboat moored on Long Island. And he spent his last years in a converted one-room former post office, a space probably not much different in size from that in which this gallery survey, one of the best of the season, is installed.

More to See
Man Ray
Through June 2. Di Donna, 744 Madison Avenue, Manhattan; 212-259-0444, didonna.com.
Man Ray portrayed the artists and writers of Paris in the 1920s and '30s as indelibly as Nadar did their 19th-century predecessors. Indeed, Man Ray's deathbed photograph of Marcel Proust makes a fitting bookend to Nadar's of Victor Hugo. But Nadar, when he memorialized France's literary titan in 1885, was himself a venerable Paris institution, while Man Ray, who rushed to Proust's apartment in 1922 at the bidding of Jean Cocteau, was an American who spoke terrible French and had been living in Paris for little over a year.
The marvel of "Man Ray's Paris Portraits, 1921-1939" is his access as well as his artistry. Before relocating, Man Ray had been befriended by Marcel Duchamp and Tristan Tzara, two vanguard artists. They smoothed his Parisian entry, and are among the subjects in this exhibition of 72 vintage prints, mostly drawn from the collection of Timothy Baum, a private art dealer who knew Man Ray in the last years of his life and collaborated on this show.
Man Ray flattered his subjects. To soften wrinkles and other imperfections, he typically shot with a long lens from a distance, and he slightly overexposed the film. Yet his portraits were profoundly revealing: the knowing eyes of the poet Anna de Noailles, the glazed stare of the perennially pickled Sinclair Lewis, the burly forcefulness of a young Alexander Calder. And then there is his self-portrait, taken in his mid-30s -- tie intentionally askew, eyes penetrating, and mouth set in a line of unstoppable determination. ARTHUR LUBOW
Chris Burden
Through June 24. Gagosian, 821 Park Avenue, Manhattan; 212-796-1228, Gagosian.com
There can't be many artists whose works are as textbook-famous and as rarely encountered as Chris Burden's. We can't expect to see repeats of the 1970s performances for which he was nailed to a Volkswagen Beetle or shot in the arm with a .22. He died in 2015, and even when he was living those were one-offs. But this rare Burden show presents other examples of the Angeleno's radical works of the 1970s. They shifted the boundaries of art, which makes them now look safely "artistic" and gallery-worthy.
The show gathers several of the "relics" -- Burden's term -- meant to stand for his performances: An empty display case represents "Disappearing," a piece for which he made himself scarce for three days; a telephone and cassette recorder represent "Wiretap," for which Burden taped calls with art dealers.
There's also footage of Burden's shooting and of "Bed Piece," a well-known performance that had him lying in a gallery for 22 days.
More surprising are the one-minute "TV Commercials" that let Burden infiltrate art into broadcast TV, after buying the ad space required. One of them, "Full Financial Disclosure," sits in Andy Warhol's Business Art genre, revealing the numbers for Burden's 1976 income and expenses -- and for his paltry profit. In "Chris Burden Promo," names of world-famous artists fill the TV one after another: "Leonardo da Vinci," "Michelangelo," "Rembrandt," "Vincent van Gogh," "Pablo Picasso" and then ... "Chris Burden." That final name would once have seemed a joke or wildly wishful thinking, but now it lives cozily with the others. BLAKE GOPNIK
Closed Shows
Pentti Monkkonen
Through May 18. Jenny's, 9 Pell Street, Manhattan; 646-861-1581, jennys.us.
It's been over a decade since New York has seen one of the grand, hyperrealist installations constructed by artists like Mike Nelson, Christoph Büchel, Gregor Schneider or Justin Lowe and Jonah Freeman. These large, psychedelic fun-house affairs functioned like surrealistic movie sets, à la Luis Buñuel or David Lynch, and came with warnings and waivers that visitors had to sign. The Minneapolis-born artist Pentti Monkkonen has created a much smaller but effectively unsettling environment with his new show, "Oscillator."
The setting is a wood-paneled office -- but things are off at the office. The shelving units radiate an icy glow; a giant moth sculpted in epoxy hangs on one wall; an enlarged vintage Visa card, issued to King Kong, on another. Embedded in the fourth wall is an old desktop computer outfitted with a synthesizer that visitors can play, creating their own retro-futuristic soundtrack. "Oscillator" mimics not so much the contemporary minimal office cubicle as a hallucinogenic rendition of a '70s Sidney Lumet movie involving contraband and hostages.
The overall medium here is nostalgia. Some appurtenances are outdated while others, like King Kong, have morphed over decades from movie monster to furry folk hero. The art world is similarly nostalgic: It used to embrace (and fund) epic installations; now we're stuck with immersive Van Gogh or Hieronymus Bosch "experiences" and art fairs. In this sense, "Oscillator" serves almost like a mnemonic device, reminding us not only of pop culture past, but lost art worlds. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Enrique Chagoya
Through May 13. George Adams Gallery, 38 Walker Street, Manhattan; 212-564-8480, georgeadamsgallery.com.
In Enrique Chagoya's painting "Detention at the Border of Language" (2023), three Native American figures in a canoe marked "Border Patrol" appear to be abducting a woman who has the head of Donald Duck. As if with a squeegee, the greenery flanking the scene has been dragged by Chagoya across the still-wet surface, creating a Gerhard-Richteresque visual glitch. The work characteristically mashes up pop and abstract elements with historical sources -- in this case by reworking Charles Ferdinand Wimar's 1853 painting, "The Abduction of Daniel Boone's Daughter by the Indians." This and the 13 other paintings, prints and book works included in "Borderless" provide a potent introduction to the Mexican-born, Californian artist's method of exploding history so as to make collages from the wreckage in a process Chagoya calls "reverse anthropology."
Chagoya's father moonlighted as an artist while working for Mexico's central bank, where his day job involved identifying forged currency. Following this example, Chagoya went on to study economics before turning to art and printmaking. This background informs "The Enlightened Savage Guide to Economic Theory" (2009-2010), in which two golem-like figures battle: one made of oil rigs with the head of Saddam Hussein provided by his portrait from an Iraqi dinar bill, the other made of fighter-jet parts with George Washington's head sourced from a U.S. dollar. Chagoya's best work remains these "codex" formats, where pre-Columbian Mayan and Aztec book traditions nearly obliterated by Spanish Catholic colonizers are hybridized with comic books and steeped in art-historical allusions. Chagoya's good-troublemaking remains ever fresh. JOHN VINCLER
King Cobra
Through May 13. JTT, 390 Broadway, Manhattan; 212-574-8152, jttnyc.com.
The schlock shock attitude of the artist known as King Cobra (a.k.a. Doreen Lynette Garner) announces itself with the ghoulish "Salome's Revenge" (2023): a pink silicone cast of a human head wedged in a deli slicer. So when you come to the tondo layered with rubbery, flesh-like scraps, you know what it's made of. Cobra's previous sculptures have used similar grindhouse techniques to explore the brutal history of medical experimentation on the Black body. Here, the "meat" contains "dirt from J. Marion Sims's grave," damning the man who pioneered gynecology on enslaved Black women, often without anesthesia.
The exhibition, "White Meat," imagines the racial concept of whiteness as a kind of mortadella -- an abstract meat, flecked with nuts and fat. Cobra's metaphorical butchery asks whether abstraction is itself a racial concept. Did white men invent abstract art? Can you abstract an artwork (or a medical "achievement") from the monster who made it?
The show's tour de force is a life-size model of a necrotic shark, patched together with pigmented silicone, beads, hair weave, steel mesh and razor blades (for the teeth), suspended in an open steel frame -- a clear parody of Damien Hirst's formaldehyded blockbuster. Work in a second gallery includes a rope of blond dreadlocks and a giant necklace of white, dreadlocked scalps. Maybe it takes this kind of bloody overstatement to show whiteness its own cruelty. And if there were ever purity in abstract art, Cobra's rough way of working rejects that, too. TRAVIS DIEHL
Peter Shear
Through May 13. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, Manhattan; 212-242-7727, cheimread.com.
Peter Shear's little paintings resemble terse, challenging poems. Painting and title resonate in the mind and eye. You decide whether these ricochets hold your interest.
Small size is the only constant here; otherwise, variations in color, suggestion, internal scale and style, prevail. "Same Day" (2021), the show's first painting, isolates a short band of meager, wobbly white lines and two narrow horizontal shapes, midway on the right edge of a dark brown field. It could depict outdoor furniture -- an earlier a center of lively human interaction -- abandoned on a beach as dusk darkens. There's an end-of-summer sadness that's a lot for a painting to sustain, but it does.
Next to it, in "Door to Door" (2022), Shear lavishes loaded brushes of white, blue, brown and green across the surface -- for a bit of forest stream, melting snow or rocky beach. Although an end in itself, this work evokes the painting-study genre and its pleasures. And soon thereafter, "Following Sea" -- which gives the show its title -- is again white on brown but solidly painted -- a suggestion of whitecaps at sea or trailed white garments left on the floor.
The paintings in the show's small first gallery are especially strong. In the two larger spaces that follow, you may find that you're able to resist and argue with more of them -- at least for a while. Shear's next direction may be signaled by the jewel-like, more solidly structured forms of "Match." ROBERTA SMITH
Mamie Tinkler
Through May 13. Ulterior, 424 Broadway, #601, Manhattan. 917-472-7784; ulteriorgallery.com.
I've never seen watercolors quite like Mamie Tinkler's. The still lifes of "A Troubling," her second solo show at Ulterior Gallery, depict densely patterned textiles, unusually tinted feathers, mirrors, skulls, curious rocks, glass globes and crackling flames. All these things shade imperceptibly into patches of saturated color that sometimes read as continuations of the pictures -- as red velvet backdrops, say, or deep black shadows -- and sometimes as a loosening into abstraction. The contrast between exactingly rendered detail and the paint's naturally soft edges is subtle, but it registers as an undertone of tension, even anguish. It's as if Tinkler is using her medium against itself.
This tension struck me as very apropos to a moment when many old certainties are melting away. Things that used to look solid, like science, journalism, the Arctic ice shelf or liberal democracy, are starting to seem more like passing apparitions. But it also says something about perception and knowing. In the show's title piece, a golden finch alights on a twig atop a blue celestial globe. Above it and beside it, as reflections or possibly familiars, two more finches rest on two more globes, their highlights indicated by larger or smaller circles of unpainted white paper. The "real" twig, in front, is loose and fuzzy, like a vision or a dream; the shadow it casts is as crisp as a razor blade. WILL HEINRICH
Helen Lundeberg
Through May 6. Bortolami, 55 Walker Street, Manhattan; 212-727-2050; bortolamigallery.com.
In the 1930s the Angeleno modernist Helen Lundeberg advanced a style referred to as Post-Surrealism, an American splinter movement meant to temper the European version's weirder imagery (but not by much; one of her early efforts includes a wrench plucking a wilted nail out of a crimson pool). By contrast, the ‌10 bracing canvases ‌here share more with the strain of work Lundeberg created contemporaneously as a W.P.A. muralist in Southern California: hard-lined geometric abstraction rendered in plush color delineating domestic zones. But Lundeberg's feel for space wasn't entirely rigid, leaving room for Surrealism's psycho-geography to haunt its corners.
Made between 1952 and 1975, the selection here focuses on bands of vertical color, soft tones dialed up or down the spectrum to achieve an enigmatic interplay of shadow, flatness and depth -- an uncanny sense of spatial perception that collides classicism with the illogical dimensions of de Chirico, his empty arcades shot through with ‌Los Angeles's‌ sepia-smog light.
When Lundeberg's uniform fields are ruptured it's with beguiling effect: punctuated by three-dimensional still lifes, as in two versions of the same arrangement called "The Mirror and Pink Shell." The earlier painting, from 1952, appears to fuzz, its brushwork legible, while the later version, started in the same year but not completed until 1969, stiffens into focus, its fields smoothed and amplified. This vignette -- a simple chair, a mirror reflecting a bare bulb -- was one Lundeberg returned to for over ‌30 years, the contours of her life distilled into the metaphysical plane. MAX LAKIN
Erin Jane Nelson
Through May 6. Chapter NY, 60 Walker Street, Manhattan; 646-850-7486, chapter-ny.com.
Erin Jane Nelson's ceramics seem curiously alive -- not as recognizable creatures, but as biomorphic forms, maybe microorganisms blown up to visible size. Mounted on the wall, they have irregular, curvy shapes and short, spindly tentacles. They're almost always clumped together, in pairs or larger groups, as if each one were dependent on the others for its existence.
If you've seen some of these pieces before, like in Nelson's contribution to the 2021 New Museum Triennial, it may not come as a surprise that her current exhibition, "Sublunary," was inspired by the Okefenokee Swamp. There's a purposeful murkiness to the work of this Atlanta-based artist, who is also a curator and writer. Nelson's creations are rarely one thing or another, but hybrids that thrive in between.
"Sublunary" displays the outgrowths of a private performance Nelson conducted on multiple visits to the Okefenokee. There are quilted silks featuring photographs; a set of 365 glazed stoneware mounds titled, collectively, "Chronomicrobiome" (2023), that could represent a kind of ritualized, abstract calendar and the wall-bound ceramics, which still intrigue me most. They have rims and are covered with a clear layer of waterlike resin, so that looking at them recalls peering into a series of shallow pools.
What's inside? Sculpted mini-mounds, flowers, and fungi; multicolored patterns; and real photographs, sometimes of Nelson. If these complex artworks were alive, I would imagine them as swimming or slinking omnivores, accumulating bits of swamp and traces of Nelson's experiences as they go. JILLIAN STEINHAUER
Sarah Palmer
Through May 6. Mrs., 60-40 56th Drive, Maspeth, Queens; 347-841-6149, mrsgallery.com.
Photography was well on track to becoming Image Producer of the millennium -- then came smartphones. Now we are so inundated with images artists have to work like archivists to wade through the morass. Sarah Palmer, a Brooklyn-based artist, does this, using images from old catalogs, New York Public Library archives, slides bought on eBay and A.I.-generated images to create photomontages. The curious and uncanny results are on view in "The Delirious Sun" at Mrs.
Recycling and repurposing are essentially the subject of the work, immediately obvious in the jumble and juxtaposition of image fragments. But Palmer teases out some through lines, like how the female body is represented in photography. In "Age of Earth and Us All Chattering" (2022), an assemblage tinted an eerie orange, photos clipped from a vintage bondage catalog sit alongside an A.I. representation of a bouncy blonde. The bondage magazine images are attached with hot pink tape to a landscape photograph of the American West taken by Palmer, and rephotographed. "Under the Tangled Forest" (2023) visually rhymes human hair, tape and ribbons; other works feature a sculpture of a female torso and close-ups of the artist's pregnant belly.
Palmer scrambles the codes of photography that tell us what, when and why an image was produced -- which is what A.I. does too. However, by putting her own body in the image, Palmer reminds us that making, crafting and contemplating photographs remain a deeply human and embodied enterprise, even at a moment when machines, once again, seem to be taking over. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Michael Ray Charles
Through May 6. Templon, 293 10th Avenue, Manhattan. 212-922-3745; templon.com.
In the 1990s and early 2000s, Michael Ray Charles's paintings excavated the ugly history of antebellum minstrelsy with nervy appropriations of ubiquitous racist imagery -- the grotesque faces and rictus grins of Sambos and mammy figures -- and not always to appreciative reception. He was accused of perpetuating painful stereotypes when many people would have preferred they remain buried. For the last 20 years he has shown sporadically, mostly in Europe.
The pictures in Charles's first New York exhibition since then finds an artist still surfacing that past, but with a slicker veneer. Where the demeaning depictions of minstrel performance and advertising were replicated at confrontational scale, unblinking in their harshness, here their bitter taste is blended into ornament. The shining obsidian bust in "(Forever Free) Veni Vidi" (2002) sits in a richly appointed Baroque interior, a recognition of the ways racism smooths itself into the background of modern life.
These are contextually complex paintings, incorporating ideas about performance (of gender, race, sexuality) and the theatricality of identity. Blackface caricatures still haunt the canvases, but they're flattened à la wheatpaste street art and spliced onto burlesque dancers and dominatrixes. The figures are often half-formed -- Black faces grafted onto white bodies missing limbs or segments of torso, obscured by gimp masks or African ones studded with cowrie shells, performing in circuses and masquerades -- a dizzying cascade of historical references that reveals the nightmare of our insatiable need for extravaganza. The metaphors can get tangled, but Charles's equation of American racism with entertainment is hard to shake, a sadomasochistic relationship dependent equally on pain and pleasure. MAX LAKIN

Full text: The market for selling goods in real time online is relatively small, but a number of start-ups and big tech names are betting American consumers will catch on.
On a warm spring evening in New York, dozens of people gathered on a rooftop in Midtown Manhattan to sip fruity cocktails and chat. Shortly after the happy hour began, a woman stepped away from the crowd and went to work.
Standing between a backdrop of fake greenery and an iPhone attached to a ring light, she put on an auctioneer's voice and implored her audience to buy a used sweater.
"Let's get this to $ 67, you guys," Iva Lazovic said, smiling and stepping toward the camera. "This is so cute. It's Lululemon. You are never getting it lower than this at the store. Let's be real. Posh has the steals and deals."
Ms. Lazovic was one of several women at the event who hopped in front of the phone to sell their wares on Posh Shows, Poshmark's new livestreaming platform, the first significant business strategy the company has unveiled since the South Korean juggernaut Naver acquired it last fall.
Poshmark is one of many companies racing to break into the United States' nascent live shopping market, which is estimated to bring in $ 32 billion in sales this year, according to the retail consulting firm Coresight Research. Eying the live shopping market in China, which, by comparison, is projected to bring in $ 647 billion this year, American companies have for years poured money into the medium, where people buy and sell products in real time over video. But American consumers have yet to take to live shopping in the same way.
In 2016, the e-commerce giant Alibaba launched Taobao Live, popularizing live shopping in China. The livestream landscape is much more fragmented in the United States, but even as shoppers return to stores, retailers and large tech firms are betting that consumers will continue searching for, and purchasing, items on their phones. For platforms, live shopping promises more engagement, with consumers sometimes spending hours watching hosts sell items. For retailers, it's another channel to sell their goods.
Alongside Poshmark, QVC's parent company Qurate recently started Sune, a live shopping app targeting Gen Z. Last year, Walmart, YouTube and eBay added or expanded their live shopping features. For Prime Day, Amazon recruited celebrities like Kevin Hart to promote its Amazon Live platform. Shein was an early adopter when it began Shein Live in 2016 for U.S. shoppers. It started with just a few hundred viewers per episode and now averages "hundreds of thousands of viewers per episode," said George Chiao, Shein's U.S. president, in a statement.
"There's just an insane level of excitement that we have seen," said Manish Chandra, the chief executive of Poshmark, at the rooftop event. "In a very few short months, they're proving that this form of live shopping works," he added, referring to Posh Shows sellers like Ms. Lazovic.
As big tech and major retailers work to gain a foothold in live shopping, start-ups like Whatnot and Ntwrk are touting their tight-knit customer communities as a blueprint for live shopping in the United States. Investors poured more than $ 380 million into livestream e-commerce companies in the United States last year, up from $ 36 million in 2020, according to PitchBook.
"We believe shopping is not just about transaction. It's about experience," said Liyia Wu, chief executive and founder of the live shopping start-up ShopShops. Live shopping can simulate "an offline shopping experience online," she added.
ShopShops in 2021 began focusing on American consumers instead of Chinese ones because it saw more opportunity in the American retail market, Ms. Wu said. Because big players haven't yet defined live shopping in the United States, ShopShops and other newcomers could "build the overall behavior," she added.
For some viewers, live shopping has taken the place of malls and morning cable shows. AJ Johnson, a lifestyle blogger in Scottsdale, Ariz., watches livestreams on ShopShops most days of the week, but her favorite show streams at 6 a.m. on Wednesdays.
The app is more than a place to shop for clothing and jewelry, she said. Ms. Johnson, 36, has found entertainment and community on ShopShops through talking to hosts and other shoppers about their lives.
"Some people play video games. I just watch livestream shopping," Ms. Johnson said. "It's like an escape."
But live shopping faces stiff competition in the United States, where linear TV, streaming channels and social media also vie for consumers' attention and money. Last year, 78 percent of American adults said they had never participated in a live shopping event, according to a survey by Morning Consult.
Some American companies have already backed out of live shopping. Meta made a major push into e-commerce at the beginning of the pandemic but shut down Instagram's live shopping feature this March, and Facebook's in October.
Other companies are making much slower entrances into live shopping. Since November, TikTok has been testing its live shopping tool, TikTok Shop, in the United States. It is betting that users will stay on TikTok to watch merchants -- both big brands like the beauty line e.l.f. and the California apparel company PacSun, as well as small business owners -- share their products and then purchase the goods through the app.
But the rollout of TikTok Shop has dragged in the United States. The feature has been available in parts of Southeast Asia for more than a year, and Douyin, TikTok's Chinese counterpart, has offered live shopping since 2018.
In the United States, TikTok is facing intense criticism from lawmakers and regulators. More than two dozens states have banned the app on government devices. And in April, Montana legislators approved a bill to block TikTok in the state, a first-of-its-kind prohibition.
TikTok declined to say when TikTok Shop would become widely available in the United States.
Companies have taken different approaches to working with hosts. On Poshmark, anyone with an account can sell items from their closets. Other platforms work directly with the merchants, as is the case with Amazon, which uses celebrities and influencers to sell a variety of products, like printers and kitchenware.
For Paige DeSorbo, a podcaster and influencer on the Bravo reality series "Summer House," hosting her own show on Amazon Live allows her followers to see a "totally different" side of her personality.
"People trust me on certain things, so they want my opinion on whether it's fashion or beauty," she said. "When I'm talking to them on live, I do feel like it's more, we're friends."
Ms. DeSorbo, 30, has hosted her show weekly since the end of 2021, typically filming episodes with two camera operators, one set designer and at least one producer. She receives a flat hosting fee from Amazon and commissions when people buy products featured on her Amazon page, or during her streams.
During a recent livestream, Ms. DeSorbo recreated outfits she had shared on social media. As she tried on "dupes"-- fashion lingo for knockoff versions of expensive items -- for her outfits, she answered viewers' questions about what to wear to events like comedy shows and summer vacations.
"It's like talking to the wizard behind the curtain," one of her more than 500 viewers commented, as Ms. DeSorbo talked about a recent trip with other reality TV cast members.
Companies will need to teach hosts how to clinch sales and speak directly to shoppers, a worthwhile investment, especially for the hosts, said Deborah Weinswig, founder of Coresight Research. In China, companies originally hired sellers to boost particular brands. Those sellers then went on to build their own audiences, drawing shoppers and eventually gaining enough agency to choose their own products and brands.
"The biggest misunderstanding was that celebrities were who were going to be driving this industry," Ms. Weinswig said. "That's why I think we in the U.S. got derailed because you being a celebrity or you being a creator -- you are not necessarily going to be a good host."
Posh Shows isn't focused on celebrity hosts. Instead, anyone with a Poshmark account can go live -- including Alex Mahl, who works full time at an attorney's office and streams live on Posh Shows for hours after work.
Ms. Mahl, 26, spends about 40 hours a week on her side hustle, including hours of prepping mostly Lululemon clothes to sell, and uploading photos of them to the Poshmark app, where viewers can see the items throughout the show. She had sold more than $ 50,000 worth of inventory by early May, and estimates that she will earn $ 200,000 in sales by the end of the year.
Ms. Mahl has considered making this her primary job but remains cautious. She received early access to Posh Shows and is keeping an eye on her viewer count as more users go live. On a recent Monday evening, Ms. Mahl competed with dozens of other sellers, including a mother with a baby strapped on her back selling New York & Company dresses for $ 8, and a man selling a Louis Vuitton wallet with a starting price of $ 475.
"Am I nervous that more people have access? Yes, I am," Ms. Mahl said. "But I'm confident in myself and what I've built for it to continue to go up in a good direction."

Full text: ON A QUIET residential street in Arlington, Va., one garage is not like the others. Clad in white corrugated steel, the structure is tall and thin with a sharply peaked roof, suggesting a giant pencil poking up through the earth. And while its neighbors might house minivans and power tools, on a gray December afternoon the door to this one, which is not really a garage at all, opens to reveal a cross-shaped plywood table set, as if for a meal, with brightly colored wares. At the center of the spread are a pair of ornately dimpled pastel-glazed earthenware vases by the French ceramist Saraï Delfendahl, each the size and silhouette of a baby elephant's foot. A chubby-armed sky blue ceramic chandelier by the New York-based artist Braxton Congrove hangs from the ceiling. The 12 unique place settings feature, among other items, an orange tumbler with three spiky legs by the New York-based artist and tableware designer Grace Whiteside and a clay oyster plate inlaid with shells by the ceramist Michele Mirisola of Brooklyn. Surprising even the gallerist Margaret Bakke, 38, the curator of this exhibition, some of the artists had taken her concept of a dinner party-themed show several steps further by contributing unsolicited additions, including two punch bowls and a poodle-topped butter dish.
Bakke established this place, which she named Friends Artspace, in 2021 after unexpectedly discovering that her long-held desire to run a gallery dovetailed with a local zoning law. She and her husband, Jesus Canales, 37, were building a house for themselves and their family on a modest corner lot when they learned its footprint could be expanded, as she recalls it, by erecting a free-standing garage on the property. The two-story structure they envisioned, some 20 feet away from their new home, would, Bakke realized, enable her to fulfill her dream of exhibiting artistic work in a familial environment. She inaugurated the 320-square-foot gallery space with a group show comprising 14 fantastical one-of-a-kind mirrors and, though she has a background in fine art -- she studied at Columbia University before working at the LeRoy Neiman Center for Print Studies, the school's nonprofit print shop, and later became an art consultant in Washington, D.C. -- the exhibitions she's mounted since then have mostly emphasized collectible design, often by emerging talents. "Design is so approachable and easy to love," she says, "because we all benefit from it."
DESPITE HER TRAINING as a painter and printmaker, Bakke prefers seeking out the work of others. As a result, her house -- a stark but inviting rectangular box with a black stucco facade and large rear windows overlooking a neat yard -- is filled with unusual creations sourced from vintage stores and art collected over the years, often from other small galleries. "I just love objects," she says, sitting on a bulbous pink velvet-upholstered Mario Bellini sofa in the compact parlor -- just off the home's 700-square-foot, open-plan living area -- where she meets with clients, usually over tea. "In a way, the gallery is an extension of my love of collecting, because I don't want to be a hoarder," she adds with a laugh. Her home, in turn, sometimes accommodates overflow inventory: On a recessed shelf behind her, arranged among several antiques shop vases, are a pair of delicate candy-colored ceramic cake stands by the New York artist Francesca DiMattio waiting to be shipped to clients. "People can't believe kids live here," says Bakke.
But the couple designed the house as much for their children -- who are 1, 3 and 6 -- as for themselves. It is just one story, and thus toddler friendly. A playroom, strewn with spill-concealing patterned Moroccan rugs, sits between the living room and the three bedrooms. The tropical-print sofa in the main room, which Bakke bought on eBay for $ 500, arrived already lightly stained. And while her collection contains valuable pieces -- a large mirrored one by the Thai artist Rirkrit Tiravanija, with whom Bakke worked at the Columbia print shop, is securely fastened to a wall behind a powder blue resin Sabine Marcelis dining table -- she tries not to be overly precious about them. In front of the living room fireplace, which is framed by a Brutalist limestone mantelpiece, is an eight-legged coffee table by the Brooklyn-based designer Misha Kahn, whose work Bakke has shown, made from scraps of stainless steel inset with jewel-like glass disks the size of dinner plates -- a room-transforming artwork strong enough for her children to dance on, as they sometimes do.
On a practical level, Bakke's practice of blurring the boundary between work and home allows her to run Friends Artspace; when necessary, her children can be with her during appointments. But the endeavor is also part of her larger vision of a more humane art world in which institutions recognize that creativity can be a collective endeavor strengthened by the ties of family and community -- one that, importantly, needn't take place in a major city. Bakke eventually wants to have a studio above the gallery and a place for artists to stay. For now, though, that dream is most fully realized at her openings. Increasingly, neighbors stop by along with artists and collectors. And there's always sidewalk chalk for the children, who cover the paved driveway with works of their own.

H&M Makes Collaborations Work: [Style Desk]

Full text: How consumers became obsessed with fashion collaborations, courtesy of the Swedish mall staple.
The year is 2015. The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of same-sex marriage. Negotiations are about to begin on the Paris Climate Accords. Mainstream pop culture is essentially "Hamilton," "Hotline Bling" and true crime docuseries. And Olivier Rousteing is at the H&M store on the Champs-Élysées, where he is starting to feel the pressure of the pandemonium outside. A policeman, he recalled, told him it was unsafe and he should leave.
Mr. Rousteing, the creative director of the French luxury brand Balmain, was making an in-store appearance for the debut of his collaboration with H&M. Just about every year since 2004, the mega-retailer has released at least one collection in partnership with a luxury fashion designer.
Much has changed in fashion in the past 20 years: the power players, the priorities of consumers, the trends and the platforms that amplify those trends. At least one thing hasn't: the frenzy around H&M's high-end designer collaborations.
Modern shopping has been shaped by this frenzy; collaborations have infested the landscape of fashion, from low to high. Just ask anyone swept up in the mess of Yeezy Gap in 2020 or Louis Vuitton and Supreme in 2017, or who has indulged in Dior Birkenstocks or an Hermès Apple Watch. Arguably, it all began with H&M.
Several of H&M's limited-edition collections have sold out within hours. Thousands have lined up outside its stores, sometimes overnight, including resellers looking to flip the sold-out pieces on eBay.
When Balmain's collaboration was released, one shopper in London described the scene as "dangerous" because of all the jostling. But for many fans of Mr. Rousteing, this was their first chance to buy his work -- to dress in the curve-hugging metallics of the "Balmain Army," whose generals have included Beyoncé, Rihanna and Kim Kardashian.
Balmain's dresses typically cost more than $ 1,000, but at H&M, thanks to cheaper materials and production processes, a plunging sequined minidress that seemed to contour the body like celebrities of the era contoured their faces was $ 199. A velvet blazer with strong shoulders and intricate pearl-like embellishments was $ 549, as opposed to $ 3,000; a cotton T-shirt with Balmain's logo was $ 34.99, not $ 395. The ad campaign was shot on a fake subway car, as if to emphasize that this collection was made for people who rode public transportation.
In a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Rousteing called the collaboration one of the "top three chapters" of his career. It was a validation to him, he said, proof of his appeal with the public, even to critics who may not have appreciated the young designer's aesthetic.
"It changed my positioning in the fashion industry," said Mr. Rousteing, then 30. "I was still 'the kid' in fashion at the time, and sometimes the press has been really tough on me. When they saw that the clients responded in such a humongous way, I think people started to realize that it was just not fireworks. My clothes, my vision, works."
On Thursday, another designer will take a turn at this right of passage: Casey Cadwallader of Mugler, who has devoted much of his H&M collection to resurrecting archival designs, simplifying Mugler's existing designs, or to making the sexy-alien aesthetic slightly more wearable. (Nipples may get three more centimeters of fabric coverage, for example.) In some cases, he replicated his "greatest hits" almost exactly, only using H&M fabrics and mass-production methods, as with a two-tone cropped denim jacket, priced by Mugler around $ 1,000 and by H&M at $ 299.
"Fashion is here to make people happy," Mr. Cadwallader said. "The more people that the work can reach and make happy, the happier I am."
Karl Did It First
When Karl Lagerfeld became the first designer to collaborate with H&M in 2004, people were in shock, said Shawn Grain Carter, an associate professor of fashion business management at the Fashion Institute of Technology. "Remember, that was the death knell for Halston, when he did a collaboration with J.C. Penney," she said. Because of the collaboration, she noted, Bergdorf Goodman stopped selling Halston.
At the time (1983), the concept of mixing "high" and "low" was not yet in vogue. But at the start of the 21st century, it came to define fashion. The first lady shopped at J. Crew. Bloggers infiltrated the editorial elite, and emerging social media platforms gave rise to new style stars. Before all that, though, the designer Isaac Mizrahi made a splashy debut at Target in 2003. The next year, Mr. Lagerfeld brought his sleek collection to H&M.
According to H&M lore, Mr. Lagerfeld immediately said yes after being approached by Donald Schneider, who later became H&M's artistic director. They knew each other already; Mr. Schneider had worked at French Vogue.
Mr. Lagerfeld's participation signaled to other designers that they could follow suit. The next H&M collaborator was Stella McCartney, who was followed by a wide range of names. For every designer who went in the direction of streetwear (Moschino) and sport (Alexander Wang), others were inspired by deconstruction (Maison Martin Margiela) and the avant-garde (Comme des Garçons).
Ann-Sofie Johansson, the creative adviser at H&M, said the best-selling collaborations have generally been the "more glamorous" ones, versus conceptual collections, like Roberto Cavalli and Balmain.
"I think every designer is a little bit worried," said Ms. Johansson, who has been with H&M for 35 years. "We all always tell them, there's going to be a long queue, you don't have to worry." The designer Alber Elbaz was so concerned that he pulled up in a limousine outside the Fifth Avenue store to spy on the line for his Lanvin collaboration in 2010. He then took selfies and chatted with customers, Ms. Johansson said.
From the designer's perspective, the upsides are clear: H&M offers intense exposure, including press coverage and a robust marketing budget. Prince and Nicki Minaj performed at a party celebrating Versace's collaboration in 2011. Sofia Coppola directed a commercial for Marni's collection in 2012, as did Baz Luhrmann for Erdem in 2017.
It can also be personally lucrative for them. The Times has reported that Stella McCartney and Mr. Lagerfeld were each paid $ 1 million for their collaborations. "And in many cases, beyond that, there's some sort of a royalty or a revenue share on top," said Marc Beckman, whose advertising firm DMA United has brokered fashion collaborations involving Gucci, LeSportsac and the N.B.A. H&M declined to comment on its financial agreements with designers.
Yet some designers, such as Rick Owens, have spoken out against working with fast-fashion companies, citing concerns over waste and disposability -- an image H&M has spent years toiling to shed.
Here, the designers provide an upside to H&M: a "halo effect," Mr. Beckman said.
"Some people will stay interested in the environmental concerns, regardless of these top-tier types of aspirational collaborations," he said. "But a lot of people will look the other way so that they can get a piece of luxury."
Democratization or Dilution?
A decade ago, Jessica Y. Flores waited in line overnight for H&M's Versace collaboration at a store in Midtown Manhattan. She sat on the sidewalk, she said, recalling that it was so cold outside that people took turns warming up inside a nearby pharmacy.
She was there because she'd grown up admiring Versace. "But I am someone who was a first-generation American, and I come from a working-class family," said Ms. Flores, now 36. "Buying high-end luxury to wear was not something that was available to me. I heard about this collection, and I was like: 'Oh, I can buy this."'
Afterward, she posted a video of her haul to her new YouTube channel. Today, she calls herself the "collaboration collection girl of YouTube," having tracked 11 years of explosive growth in the mass-market collaboration landscape. She has made vlogs about buying bags from Fendace, sneakers from Nike and Tiffany and clothes from Target's collections with Victoria Beckham and many more. (She has not received free or discounted clothes from these brands but has occasionally produced sponsored content for other companies.) (While Target's collaboration program has continued since Mr. Mizrahi's days, the company's focus has turned increasingly to emerging designers rather than luxury brands.)
Ms. Flores has seen how collaborations have gone from mass-market efforts at democratization -- a term used by most people interviewed for this story -- to in-house drops led by high-end brands. When Gucci and Balenciaga collaborated with Adidas, for example, the pieces were sold on the luxury brands' platforms and at their prices: $ 850 for a pair of logo-covered Gazelles or pre-worn-down Stan Smiths.
Lately she has noticed some negative comments about the accessibility of Mugler's collaboration. "One of the phrases that keeps coming up, over and over again, is that 'It'll cheapen the brand,"' she said. Complicating matters is Mugler's decision to offer some near-replicas of its core pieces.
"If the silhouette is so similar to the runway collection that you can't distinguish why you would offer it at such a low price point, you are very close to the line," Ms. Grain Carter said -- the line being "the dilution of the brand."
Quality and craftsmanship are what traditionally set low-end and high-end fashion apart. So what happens when H&M sells pieces that closely resemble the high-end versions, and made with more expensive materials than its regular lines?
"I was very much expecting the cheap substitute for every fabric that we normally use," Mr. Cadwallader said of the development process with H&M. But in many cases, he said, the company was using materials similar to his. "It really looks like the real thing."
Still, Ms. Flores is not convinced the "cheapening" conversation she has seen online is anything more than elitism. "Some people do not want the everyday person to have access to the things that they have access to," she said.
As for Thursday, she doesn't know whether she'll try to shop the collaboration. Her favored H&M store in Queens closed last year. And the designs are a little too revealing and body-conscious for her current tastes.
But many signs point to another swift clearing out of every last pair of sheer leggings and all the corset hoodies. Because, as Mr. Beckman said, "H&M just dominates this."

Newly Reviewed
Peter Shear
Through May 13. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, Manhattan; 212-242-7727, cheimread.com.
Peter Shear's little paintings resemble terse, challenging poems. Painting and title resonate in the mind and eye. You decide whether these ricochets hold your interest.
Small size is the only constant here; otherwise, variations in color, suggestion, internal scale and style, prevail. "Same Day" (2021), the show's first painting, isolates a short band of meager, wobbly white lines and two narrow horizontal shapes, midway on the right edge of a dark brown field. It could depict outdoor furniture -- an earlier a center of lively human interaction -- abandoned on a beach as dusk darkens. There's an end-of-summer sadness that's a lot for a painting to sustain, but it does.
Next to it, in "Door to Door" (2022), Shear lavishes loaded brushes of white, blue, brown and green across the surface -- for a bit of forest stream, melting snow or rocky beach. Although an end in itself, this work evokes the painting-study genre and its pleasures. And soon thereafter, "Following Sea" -- which gives the show its title -- is again white on brown but solidly painted -- a suggestion of whitecaps at sea or trailed white garments left on the floor.
The paintings in the show's small first gallery are especially strong. In the two larger spaces that follow, you may find that you're able to resist and argue with more of them -- at least for a while. Shear's next direction may be signaled by the jewel-like, more solidly structured forms of "Match." ROBERTA SMITH
Michael McGrath
Through May 19. Crossing Art, 559 West 23rd Street, Manhattan, 212-359-4333, crossingart.com.
The artist Michael McGrath, who is based in Rhinebeck, in the Hudson Valley, paints what might be called the emoji landscape: screaming flowers; surprised-looking insects and trees. Scattered, wallpaper-like, across canvases whose titles nod to gods, witches and seasonal magic spells, his show "Moon Riot" at Crossing Art thrums with laid-back spiritualist energy.
McGrath's work took a radical turn a couple of years ago. (I discovered him on Instagram.) He was painting pleasingly anodyne landscapes and dark figures in the vein of Edvard Munch, and suddenly his work exploded with Day-Glo color and singing plants, unmoored in their compositions. Rather than serious or apocalyptic, his work is warm and funny, like folk art or children's drawings, and complemented by titles like "Intro to Hunting Gods," "Spring Training for Witches," "Redesigning Ghost Systems" and "Weekend Conference for Moons and Tiny Vampires."
The show includes a few missteps: It's overhung, and I could live without the fake-fur yeti figures that feel more like theme park mascots than sculpture. McGrath's work is refreshing, though, because it materializes the wonder of walking in the woods and a deeper sense that the world, minus humans, will be OK; everything regenerates, as it does in Thomas Cole's 19th-century Hudson River School masterpiece series "The Course of Empire" (1833-1836), which might be the first American paintings warning of the Anthropocene. McGrath has channeled something: maybe spirits, maybe gods, but mostly the anti-artifice of so-called outsider artists, who are plugged into a different frequency. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Enrique Chagoya
Through May 13. George Adams Gallery, 38 Walker Street, Manhattan; 212-564-8480, georgeadamsgallery.com.
In Enrique Chagoya's painting "Detention at the Border of Language" (2023), three Native American figures in a canoe marked "Border Patrol" appear to be abducting a woman who has the head of Donald Duck. As if with a squeegee, the greenery flanking the scene has been dragged by Chagoya across the still-wet surface, creating a Gerhard-Richteresque visual glitch. The work characteristically mashes up pop and abstract elements with historical sources -- in this case by reworking Charles Ferdinand Wimar's 1853 painting, "The Abduction of Daniel Boone's Daughter by the Indians." This and the 13 other paintings, prints and book works included in "Borderless" provide a potent introduction to the Mexican-born, Californian artist's method of exploding history so as to make collages from the wreckage in a process Chagoya calls "reverse anthropology."
Chagoya's father moonlighted as an artist while working for Mexico's central bank, where his day job involved identifying forged currency. Following this example, Chagoya went on to study economics before turning to art and printmaking. This background informs "The Enlightened Savage Guide to Economic Theory" (2009-2010), in which two golem-like figures battle: one made of oil rigs with the head of Saddam Hussein provided by his portrait from an Iraqi dinar bill, the other made of fighter-jet parts with George Washington's head sourced from a U.S. dollar. Chagoya's best work remains these "codex" formats, where pre-Columbian Mayan and Aztec book traditions nearly obliterated by Spanish Catholic colonizers are hybridized with comic books and steeped in art-historical allusions. Chagoya's good-troublemaking remains ever fresh. JOHN VINCLER
King Cobra
Through May 13. JTT, 390 Broadway, Manhattan; 212-574-8152, jttnyc.com.
The schlock shock attitude of the artist known as King Cobra (a.k.a. Doreen Lynette Garner) announces itself with the ghoulish "Salome's Revenge" (2023): a pink silicone cast of a human head wedged in a deli slicer. So when you come to the tondo layered with rubbery, flesh-like scraps, you know what it's made of. Cobra's previous sculptures have used similar grindhouse techniques to explore the brutal history of medical experimentation on the Black body. Here, the "meat" contains "dirt from J. Marion Sims's grave," damning the man who pioneered gynecology on enslaved Black women, often without anesthesia.
The exhibition, "White Meat," imagines the racial concept of whiteness as a kind of mortadella -- an abstract meat, flecked with nuts and fat. Cobra's metaphorical butchery asks whether abstraction is itself a racial concept. Did white men invent abstract art? Can you abstract an artwork (or a medical "achievement") from the monster who made it?
The show's tour de force is a life-size model of a necrotic shark, patched together with pigmented silicone, beads, hair weave, steel mesh and razor blades (for the teeth), suspended in an open steel frame -- a clear parody of Damien Hirst's formaldehyded blockbuster. Work in a second gallery includes a rope of blond dreadlocks and a giant necklace of white, dreadlocked scalps. Maybe it takes this kind of bloody overstatement to show whiteness its own cruelty. And if there were ever purity in abstract art, Cobra's rough way of working rejects that, too. TRAVIS DIEHL
Man Ray
Through June 2. Di Donna, 744 Madison Avenue, Manhattan; 212-259-0444, didonna.com.
Man Ray portrayed the artists and writers of Paris in the 1920s and '30s as indelibly as Nadar did their 19th-century predecessors. Indeed, Man Ray's deathbed photograph of Marcel Proust makes a fitting bookend to Nadar's of Victor Hugo. But Nadar, when he memorialized France's literary titan in 1885, was himself a venerable Paris institution, while Man Ray, who rushed to Proust's apartment in 1922 at the bidding of Jean Cocteau, was an American who spoke terrible French and had been living in Paris for little over a year.
The marvel of "Man Ray's Paris Portraits, 1921-1939" is his access as well as his artistry. Before relocating, Man Ray had been befriended by Marcel Duchamp and Tristan Tzara, two vanguard artists. They smoothed his Parisian entry, and are among the subjects in this exhibition of 72 vintage prints, mostly drawn from the collection of Timothy Baum, a private art dealer who knew Man Ray in the last years of his life and collaborated on this show.
Man Ray flattered his subjects. To soften wrinkles and other imperfections, he typically shot with a long lens from a distance, and he slightly overexposed the film. Yet his portraits were profoundly revealing: the knowing eyes of the poet Anna de Noailles, the glazed stare of the perennially pickled Sinclair Lewis, the burly forcefulness of a young Alexander Calder. And then there is his self-portrait, taken in his mid-30s -- tie intentionally askew, eyes penetrating, and mouth set in a line of unstoppable determination. ARTHUR LUBOW
Last Chance
Helen Lundeberg
Through May 6. Bortolami, 55 Walker Street, Manhattan; 212-727-2050; bortolamigallery.com.
In the 1930s the Angeleno modernist Helen Lundeberg advanced a style referred to as Post-Surrealism, an American splinter movement meant to temper the European version's weirder imagery (but not by much; one of her early efforts includes a wrench plucking a wilted nail out of a crimson pool). By contrast, the ‌10 bracing canvases ‌here share more with the strain of work Lundeberg created contemporaneously as a W.P.A. muralist in Southern California: hard-lined geometric abstraction rendered in plush color delineating domestic zones. But Lundeberg's feel for space wasn't entirely rigid, leaving room for Surrealism's psycho-geography to haunt its corners.
Made between 1952 and 1975, the selection here focuses on bands of vertical color, soft tones dialed up or down the spectrum to achieve an enigmatic interplay of shadow, flatness and depth -- an uncanny sense of spatial perception that collides classicism with the illogical dimensions of de Chirico, his empty arcades shot through with ‌Los Angeles's‌ sepia-smog light.
When Lundeberg's uniform fields are ruptured it's with beguiling effect: punctuated by three-dimensional still lifes, as in two versions of the same arrangement called "The Mirror and Pink Shell." The earlier painting, from 1952, appears to fuzz, its brushwork legible, while the later version, started in the same year but not completed until 1969, stiffens into focus, its fields smoothed and amplified. This vignette -- a simple chair, a mirror reflecting a bare bulb -- was one Lundeberg returned to for over ‌30 years, the contours of her life distilled into the metaphysical plane. MAX LAKIN
Erin Jane Nelson
Through May 6. Chapter NY, 60 Walker Street, Manhattan; 646-850-7486, chapter-ny.com.
Erin Jane Nelson's ceramics seem curiously alive -- not as recognizable creatures, but as biomorphic forms, maybe microorganisms blown up to visible size. Mounted on the wall, they have irregular, curvy shapes and short, spindly tentacles. They're almost always clumped together, in pairs or larger groups, as if each one were dependent on the others for its existence.
If you've seen some of these pieces before, like in Nelson's contribution to the 2021 New Museum Triennial, it may not come as a surprise that her current exhibition, "Sublunary," was inspired by the Okefenokee Swamp. There's a purposeful murkiness to the work of this Atlanta-based artist, who is also a curator and writer. Nelson's creations are rarely one thing or another, but hybrids that thrive in between.
"Sublunary" displays the outgrowths of a private performance Nelson conducted on multiple visits to the Okefenokee. There are quilted silks featuring photographs; a set of 365 glazed stoneware mounds titled, collectively, "Chronomicrobiome" (2023), that could represent a kind of ritualized, abstract calendar and the wall-bound ceramics, which still intrigue me most. They have rims and are covered with a clear layer of waterlike resin, so that looking at them recalls peering into a series of shallow pools.
What's inside? Sculpted mini-mounds, flowers, and fungi; multicolored patterns; and real photographs, sometimes of Nelson. If these complex artworks were alive, I would imagine them as swimming or slinking omnivores, accumulating bits of swamp and traces of Nelson's experiences as they go. JILLIAN STEINHAUER
Sarah Palmer
Through May 6. Mrs., 60-40 56th Drive, Maspeth, Queens; 347-841-6149, mrsgallery.com.
Photography was well on track to becoming Image Producer of the millennium -- then came smartphones. Now we are so inundated with images artists have to work like archivists to wade through the morass. Sarah Palmer, a Brooklyn-based artist, does this, using images from old catalogs, New York Public Library archives, slides bought on eBay and A.I.-generated images to create photomontages. The curious and uncanny results are on view in "The Delirious Sun" at Mrs.
Recycling and repurposing are essentially the subject of the work, immediately obvious in the jumble and juxtaposition of image fragments. But Palmer teases out some through lines, like how the female body is represented in photography. In "Age of Earth and Us All Chattering" (2022), an assemblage tinted an eerie orange, photos clipped from a vintage bondage catalog sit alongside an A.I. representation of a bouncy blonde. The bondage magazine images are attached with hot pink tape to a landscape photograph of the American West taken by Palmer, and rephotographed. "Under the Tangled Forest" (2023) visually rhymes human hair, tape and ribbons; other works feature a sculpture of a female torso and close-ups of the artist's pregnant belly.
Palmer scrambles the codes of photography that tell us what, when and why an image was produced -- which is what A.I. does too. However, by putting her own body in the image, Palmer reminds us that making, crafting and contemplating photographs remain a deeply human and embodied enterprise, even at a moment when machines, once again, seem to be taking over. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Michael Ray Charles
Through May 6. Templon, 293 10th Avenue, Manhattan. 212-922-3745; templon.com.
In the 1990s and early 2000s, Michael Ray Charles's paintings excavated the ugly history of antebellum minstrelsy with nervy appropriations of ubiquitous racist imagery -- the grotesque faces and rictus grins of Sambos and mammy figures -- and not always to appreciative reception. He was accused of perpetuating painful stereotypes when many people would have preferred they remain buried. For the last 20 years he has shown sporadically, mostly in Europe.
The pictures in Charles's first New York exhibition since then finds an artist still surfacing that past, but with a slicker veneer. Where the demeaning depictions of minstrel performance and advertising were replicated at confrontational scale, unblinking in their harshness, here their bitter taste is blended into ornament. The shining obsidian bust in "(Forever Free) Veni Vidi" (2002) sits in a richly appointed Baroque interior, a recognition of the ways racism smooths itself into the background of modern life.
These are contextually complex paintings, incorporating ideas about performance (of gender, race, sexuality) and the theatricality of identity. Blackface caricatures still haunt the canvases, but they're flattened à la wheatpaste street art and spliced onto burlesque dancers and dominatrixes. The figures are often half-formed -- Black faces grafted onto white bodies missing limbs or segments of torso, obscured by gimp masks or African ones studded with cowrie shells, performing in circuses and masquerades -- a dizzying cascade of historical references that reveals the nightmare of our insatiable need for extravaganza. The metaphors can get tangled, but Charles's equation of American racism with entertainment is hard to shake, a sadomasochistic relationship dependent equally on pain and pleasure. MAX LAKIN
More to See
Mamie Tinkler
Through May 13. Ulterior, 424 Broadway, #601, Manhattan. 917-472-7784; ulteriorgallery.com.
I've never seen watercolors quite like Mamie Tinkler's. The still lifes of "A Troubling," her second solo show at Ulterior Gallery, depict densely patterned textiles, unusually tinted feathers, mirrors, skulls, curious rocks, glass globes and crackling flames. All these things shade imperceptibly into patches of saturated color that sometimes read as continuations of the pictures -- as red velvet backdrops, say, or deep black shadows -- and sometimes as a loosening into abstraction. The contrast between exactingly rendered detail and the paint's naturally soft edges is subtle, but it registers as an undertone of tension, even anguish. It's as if Tinkler is using her medium against itself.
This tension struck me as very apropos to a moment when many old certainties are melting away. Things that used to look solid, like science, journalism, the Arctic ice shelf or liberal democracy, are starting to seem more like passing apparitions. But it also says something about perception and knowing. In the show's title piece, a golden finch alights on a twig atop a blue celestial globe. Above it and beside it, as reflections or possibly familiars, two more finches rest on two more globes, their highlights indicated by larger or smaller circles of unpainted white paper. The "real" twig, in front, is loose and fuzzy, like a vision or a dream; the shadow it casts is as crisp as a razor blade. WILL HEINRICH
Chris Burden
Through June 24. Gagosian, 821 Park Avenue, Manhattan; 212-796-1228, Gagosian.com
There can't be many artists whose works are as textbook-famous and as rarely encountered as Chris Burden's. We can't expect to see repeats of the 1970s performances for which he was nailed to a Volkswagen Beetle or shot in the arm with a .22. He died in 2015, and even when he was living those were one-offs. But this rare Burden show presents other examples of the Angeleno's radical works of the 1970s. They shifted the boundaries of art, which makes them now look safely "artistic" and gallery-worthy.
The show gathers several of the "relics" -- Burden's term -- meant to stand for his performances: An empty display case represents "Disappearing," a piece for which he made himself scarce for three days; a telephone and cassette recorder represent "Wiretap," for which Burden taped calls with art dealers.
There's also footage of Burden's shooting and of "Bed Piece," a well-known performance that had him lying in a gallery for 22 days.
More surprising are the one-minute "TV Commercials" that let Burden infiltrate art into broadcast TV, after buying the ad space required. One of them, "Full Financial Disclosure," sits in Andy Warhol's Business Art genre, revealing the numbers for Burden's 1976 income and expenses -- and for his paltry profit. In "Chris Burden Promo," names of world-famous artists fill the TV one after another: "Leonardo da Vinci," "Michelangelo," "Rembrandt," "Vincent van Gogh," "Pablo Picasso" and then ... "Chris Burden." That final name would once have seemed a joke or wildly wishful thinking, but now it lives cozily with the others. BLAKE GOPNIK

Full text: Helen Lundeberg
Through May 6. Bortolami, 55 Walker Street, Manhattan; 212-727-2050; bortolamigallery.com.
In the 1930s the Angeleno modernist Helen Lundeberg advanced a style referred to as Post-Surrealism, an American splinter movement meant to temper the European version's weirder imagery (but not by much; one of her early efforts includes a wrench plucking a wilted nail out of a crimson pool). By contrast, the ‌10 bracing canvases ‌here share more with the strain of work Lundeberg created contemporaneously as a W.P.A. muralist in Southern California: hard-lined geometric abstraction rendered in plush color delineating domestic zones. But Lundeberg's feel for space wasn't entirely rigid, leaving room for Surrealism's psycho-geography to haunt its corners.
Made between 1952 and 1975, the selection here focuses on bands of vertical color, soft tones dialed up or down the spectrum to achieve an enigmatic interplay of shadow, flatness and depth -- an uncanny sense of spatial perception that collides classicism with the illogical dimensions of de Chirico, his empty arcades shot through with ‌Los Angeles's‌ sepia-smog light.
When Lundeberg's uniform fields are ruptured it's with beguiling effect: punctuated by three-dimensional still lifes, as in two versions of the same arrangement called "The Mirror and Pink Shell." The earlier painting, from 1952, appears to fuzz, its brushwork legible, while the later version, started in the same year but not completed until 1969, stiffens into focus, its fields smoothed and amplified. This vignette -- a simple chair, a mirror reflecting a bare bulb -- was one Lundeberg returned to for over ‌30 years, the contours of her life distilled into the metaphysical plane. MAX LAKIN
Erin Jane Nelson
Through May 6. Chapter NY, 60 Walker Street, Manhattan; 646-850-7486, chapter-ny.com.
Erin Jane Nelson's ceramics seem curiously alive -- not as recognizable creatures, but as biomorphic forms, maybe microorganisms blown up to visible size. Mounted on the wall, they have irregular, curvy shapes and short, spindly tentacles. They're almost always clumped together, in pairs or larger groups, as if each one were dependent on the others for its existence.
If you've seen some of these pieces before, like in Nelson's contribution to the 2021 New Museum Triennial, it may not come as a surprise that her current exhibition, "Sublunary," was inspired by the Okefenokee Swamp. There's a purposeful murkiness to the work of this Atlanta-based artist, who is also a curator and writer. Nelson's creations are rarely one thing or another, but hybrids that thrive in between.
"Sublunary" displays the outgrowths of a private performance Nelson conducted on multiple visits to the Okefenokee. There are quilted silks featuring photographs; a set of 365 glazed stoneware mounds titled, collectively, "Chronomicrobiome" (2023), that could represent a kind of ritualized, abstract calendar and the wall-bound ceramics, which still intrigue me most. They have rims and are covered with a clear layer of waterlike resin, so that looking at them recalls peering into a series of shallow pools.
What's inside? Sculpted mini-mounds, flowers, and fungi; multicolored patterns; and real photographs, sometimes of Nelson. If these complex artworks were alive, I would imagine them as swimming or slinking omnivores, accumulating bits of swamp and traces of Nelson's experiences as they go. JILLIAN STEINHAUER
Mamie Tinkler
Through May 13. Ulterior, 424 Broadway #601, Manhattan. 917-472-7784; ulteriorgallery.com.
I've never seen watercolors quite like Mamie Tinkler's. The still lifes of "A Troubling," her second solo show at Ulterior Gallery, depict densely patterned textiles, unusually tinted feathers, mirrors, skulls, curious rocks, glass globes and crackling flames. All these things shade imperceptibly into patches of saturated color that sometimes read as continuations of the pictures -- as red velvet backdrops, say, or deep black shadows -- and sometimes as a loosening into abstraction. The contrast between exactingly rendered detail and the paint's naturally soft edges is subtle, but it registers as an undertone of tension, even anguish. It's as if Tinkler is using her medium against itself.
This tension struck me as very apropos to a moment when many old certainties are melting away. Things that used to look solid, like science, journalism, the Arctic ice shelf or liberal democracy, are starting to seem more like passing apparitions. But it also says something about perception and knowing. In the show's title piece, a golden finch alights on a twig atop a blue celestial globe. Above it and beside it, as reflections or possibly familiars, two more finches rest on two more globes, their highlights indicated by larger or smaller circles of unpainted white paper. The "real" twig, in front, is loose and fuzzy, like a vision or a dream; the shadow it casts is as crisp as a razor blade. WILL HEINRICH
Sarah Palmer
Through May 6. Mrs., 60-40 56th Drive, Maspeth, Queens; 347-841-6149, mrsgallery.com.
Photography was well on track to becoming Image Producer of the millennium -- then came smartphones. Now we are so inundated with images artists have to work like archivists to wade through the morass. Sarah Palmer, a Brooklyn-based artist, does this, using images from old catalogs, New York Public Library archives, slides bought on eBay and A.I.-generated images to create photomontages. The curious and uncanny results are on view in "The Delirious Sun" at Mrs.
Recycling and repurposing are essentially the subject of the work, immediately obvious in the jumble and juxtaposition of image fragments. But Palmer teases out some through lines, like how the female body is represented in photography. In "Age of Earth and Us All Chattering" (2022), an assemblage tinted an eerie orange, photos clipped from a vintage bondage catalog sit alongside an A.I. representation of a bouncy blonde. The bondage magazine images are attached with hot pink tape to a landscape photograph of the American West taken by Palmer, and rephotographed. "Under the Tangled Forest" (2023) visually rhymes human hair, tape and ribbons; other works feature a sculpture of a female torso and close-ups of the artist's pregnant belly.
Palmer scrambles the codes of photography that tell us what, when and why an image was produced -- which is what A.I. does too. However, by putting her own body in the image, Palmer reminds us that making, crafting and contemplating photographs remain a deeply human and embodied enterprise, even at a moment when machines, once again, seem to be taking over.

TikTok Feuds in the Diamond District: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Zev Weitman's angular frame was hunched over his sooty workbench in a cramped diamond-cutting shop several floors above the buzz of Manhattan's diamond district. But his mind was roaming a crystalline chamber, tweaking facets to coax a brilliant symphony of light from the diamond he was working against a cutting wheel.
"I'm always improvising, always searching for the perfect cut," said Mr. Weitman, 68, who began cutting in the district four decades ago, when thousands of jewelry businesses studded a single block of 47th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. Back then, there were also thousands of cutters like Mr. Weitman, many of them shaping and perfecting diamonds from rough stones straight out of mines.
Now, Mr. Weitman says, only a few hundred remain in the district, focusing on repairs, rush jobs and the kind of high-end work he does. His dozen apprentices are gone, and he labors and obsesses over the stones by himself -- working at the wheel or solving problems in bed, in the shower or in stolen overnight naps on his coat on the shop's tile floor. None of his four children -- nor, presumably, any of his 28 grandchildren -- will follow him into his trade.
The death of the diamond district has been foretold for years. Most diamond-cutting work has been outsourced to factories overseas. Online shopping has cut into showroom sales. The pandemic lockdown derailed supply and devastated foot traffic. Inexpensive lab-grown diamonds resembling real ones have rattled a seemingly unshakable diamond economy. Many longstanding family shops have downsized or lack succession plans. Booth vacancies in once-bustling jewelry exchanges are a common sight.
And now, the inevitable: A mega-developer has demolished more than a dozen buildings in the district to make way for two huge structures, a supertall tower and a luxury hotel. This, some old-school jewelers fear, will change the unique character of the diamond district.
But there is another facet to this gloomy prognosis.
Right across the street from where Mr. Weitman was sweating out the perfect cut is a glittering storefront counter awash in rap star bling. The aura of the shop, TraxNYC, could not be more different from the Old World austerity of Mr. Weitman's cutting studio.
Showcases are filled with jewel-encrusted pendants, and gold chains drip from graffitied jewelry stands tended by a young, diverse sales staff that would not look out of place at a Brooklyn dance club.
In the rear of the showroom is a staircase that leads to the V.I.P. lounge, where the unmistakable fragrance of marijuana lingers and preferred customers peruse jewelry served up by employees along with complimentary diversions: premium liquor, pre-rolled joints, a video game console.
Where past generations of diamond cutters might have hunkered down, TraxNYC has a team of 20-somethings sitting at a common table, noisily handling online and phone sales and taking custom orders started on the spot with design software and 3-D printers.
"We're transforming the industry, and these are the young people who will be taking it over," said the owner, Maksud Agadjani, 36, whose designs are popular with clients like Cardi B and Busta Rhymes.
"People may want to watch the old diamond district in movies and on TV, but the truth is people don't want to go to the diamond district anymore," Mr. Agadjani said. "So the old ways have to get ripped up."
But the old ways are not gone yet. As Midtown has been transformed by tourism, soaring commercial rents and proliferating chain stores, the diamond district seems to stand out more than ever as an anachronism.
Compared with the high-end flagship shops on Fifth Avenue -- Cartier, Harry Winston, Tiffany & Company -- 47th Street feels like a time warp. Makeshift synagogues and kosher eateries are wedged between jewelry office suites. On the sidewalk, Hasidic diamond dealers haggle on flip phones while groups of men smoke and banter in various languages and hawkers try to lure passers-by into showrooms.
Mr. Agadjani sneers at all that. Who needs a hawker when his Instagram posts and TikTok videos bring in millions of views a day? "We do $ 20 million on the daily between all of us," he said, referring to the volume of the whole district. He has now been on the block for 18 years, and his shop does more than $ 30 million in annual sales.
He started the company with a high school graduation gift of $ 1,500 and sold jewelry on consignment on eBay. Now he focuses on popularizing his brand through social media, publicity stunts and a YouTube reality show called "The District."
He gets lots of mileage out of beefs with rappers and reality show stars. His feud with the Brooklyn-based rapper Tekashi69 became publicity pay dirt when 50 Cent came to Tekashi's defense and called Mr. Agadjani a "sucker." It didn't matter that Mr. Agadjani was ridiculed -- the post went viral.
"The past is the past, and things are evolving super quickly," he said. "While one part of the district is dying, another part is being born."
New York's most precious export
With all due respect to Mr. Agadjani's swagger, he did not invent the 47th Street hustle.
The jewelry district in New York emerged in the 1800s as a cluster of shops in Lower Manhattan. Later on, Jewish diamond merchants fleeing Europe before World War II began setting up on 47th Street.
Much of the industry's roots in Orthodox Jewish parts of Eastern Europe is reflected in the block's own vocabulary, largely Yiddish. A "strop" is a second-rate stone that won't sell; it's "khazeray" or "shlok" -- garbage. Merchants share a secret code to freely discuss a "gee," or customer. A "2-10" is a warning to keep "two eyes on 10 fingers" when serving a potential thief.
This secret world is revealed on the upper floors above the showrooms in a honeycomb of cramped workshops, retail stalls and anonymous office suites. Here, the polishers, sorters, appraisers, graders and bench jewelers toil behind locked double-door vestibules ("man-traps") that allow visitors to be checked before entry and exit.
Even with all the challenges, jewelry, gems and precious metals from the diamond district are still among New York State's most valuable exports, and the stores around 47th Street make up the largest diamond market in the country, a conduit for an estimated 90 percent of the diamonds imported into the United States. High-end pieces that end up for sale at Tiffany and Harry Winston often begin their lives here as raw material.
"I mean, other than bagels, what else is made in New York anymore?" said Romy Schreiber, whose grandmother started Gumuchian Jewelry, one of the only matrilineal businesses that have endured among diamond dealers.
The district can be intimidating to outsiders not accustomed to the hard sell.
On a recent weekday, a woman holding a cardboard sign -- "WE BUY CASH LOAN" -- tried to flag down passers-by on the block. The woman, Mirta Kuzmana, is perhaps the only female hawker there. She can speak five languages, including her native Latvian, and makes $ 70 a day luring customers into a pawnshop.
"I show you the best deals anywhere," she said to a family of tourists. They declined and sidestepped her, and she directed her sidewalk pitch to the next comers.
Across the street, Richie Winick leaned over the display case of his stall in a bustling exchange.
"It's not beautiful like Madison Avenue, but if you know the people you're dealing with, you'll pay much less," Mr. Winick said. Now 62, he runs the jewelry company his father started almost 70 years ago. Compared with Mr. Weitman's laborious craftsmanship or Mr. Agadjani's social media savvy, his business is more representative of the district, though he has rolled with the times by sharing office space with an Indian firm that specializes in lab-grown diamonds.
Still, the old-school barter economy persists. Many deals are done on credit, with millions of dollars entrusted to a handwritten memo and a handshake and a blessing of "mazel und brucha" -- Yiddish for "luck and blessing."
"You can have a $ 10 million deal just by signing your name," Mr. Winick said. "Where else can you do that?"
A customer appeared in his shop looking for a diamond ring for his girlfriend, and Mr. Winick went into his spiel. "Here, look at this," he began. "This is a $ 200,000 stone at Tiffany's, but you save 50 cents on the dollar by shopping on 47th Street." The customer opted for a smaller diamond. A good choice, Mr. Winick told him.
"You know the 11th Commandment, right?" he added. "Thou shalt not pay retail."
It is unclear where modernization will leave someone like Mr. Weitman, who regards his 40-year career as an obsessive quest for the ultimate cut that makes a diamond dazzle with light. He called it a mystical pursuit that blends optical physics, the eye of an artist and the touch of a surgeon. One of his devoted following of dealers referred to him as "the man with the diamond eyes."
In the cutting room, he resembled a painter at his canvas, pulling back periodically to evaluate his work by lifting the gem to an overhead lamp. He peered through a magnifying loupe into its tiny twinkling windows to inspect cuts made for maximum brilliance and scintillation crucial to the stone's beauty.
Ideas for new designs germinate without warning and are fleshed out through trial and error. But they are executed in the shop, where he can spend weeks on a single stone.
"When you're cutting, there is nothing else," said Mr. Weitman, who has spent all-nighters lost in his work in the shop. "It's like watching Michael Jordan play against the Knicks. It's excitement beyond anything you could imagine."
Cutters work under high pressure. They must preserve valuable carat weight while managing the constant risk of shattering the gem with a single misplaced cut. "If you hit a gletz" -- an imperfection -- "it can shatter," Mr. Weitman said. "Sometimes it can't be prevented. It's a terrible feeling."
One of Mr. Weitman's dealers, Charles Paskesz, 53, started as a diamond cutter, but while he was working on a $ 15,000 stone, it suddenly shattered. Plagued with nightmares, he quit cutting.
"I never put another stone on the wheel," said Mr. Paskesz, now a diamond dealer with IGC Group, a large Belgian company with an office in the district.
The influencer and the artisan
The stakes are also high for the new breed of diamond dealers. A showroom down the block from TraxNYC that also caters to a hip-hop clientele was held up by armed robbers several years back and now has security guards who look like nightclub bouncers.
For Mr. Agadjani, who grew up in Rego Park, Queens, after his parents immigrated from Azerbaijan when he was 7, this is the culture he knows. "My father told me, 'This is a place with real opportunity,"' said Mr. Agadjani, who graduated from Forest Hills High School. "I sized up America quick enough."
At one point he dressed one of his sales agents in a squirrel costume to make another goofball post goading a rival. Nothing like a good social media beef to flog the brand.
Mr. Agadjani's recent social media dust-up with Scott Disick, an influencer and reality TV star on "Keeping Up With the Kardashians," turned into marketing gold. Calling out Mr. Disick on Instagram was a boon for the jeweler's brand, as was the very public way Mr. Agadjani delivered a custom-made gremlin necklace to Kodak Black: He strolled onstage at a concert in Miami and fastened it around his neck as a sea of smartphones captured the moment.
As much as Mr. Agadjani may distance himself from the diamond district's more traditional business methods, he will admit one thing: Location is crucial.
"I'm not getting my jewelry from Walmart," he said. "I have to manufacture it, and this block is a factory. Everyone is critical. One guy's polishing, another guy's casting, another's soldering. This guy's setting gemstones, that guy's an enameler."
Although Mr. Agadjani and Mr. Weitman seem like opposites, they are similar in their obsessional pursuit as jewelers, to the point of losing sleep.
"I'd like to meet him," Mr. Agadjani said as his team slapped some taunting graphics on the squirrel video and posted it. "Guys like him -- that's why I'm here."

When the Office Itself Makes a Commute: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Working with the architect Tom Kundig, a creative director had a crazy idea: Wouldn't it be cool if you could put your work space on a railroad track?
When it's time for Lou Maxon to commute to work, he never has to worry about missing his train. Why? His office is the train.
When Mr. Maxon steps inside and pulls a lever, the entire two-story structure pulls away from his house in Carnation, Wash., and rolls down a 110-foot-long track -- his own personal railroad.
"There's a detachment to literally leaving the house," said Mr. Maxon, 48, a creative director who has worked in branding and marketing for clients including Lexus, Microsoft and Lego, and who previously had a connected home office where he struggled with distractions.
Beyond the peace and quiet, the mobility of the building allows him to take in inspiring views. "There are different moments along the rail," he said. "If you take it halfway, that's where our fire pit is. If you take it all the way out, you move from being open to being really in the woods, where the light is just different."
Built from weathering steel and glass, with a metal door finished in bright yellow automotive paint, the studio measures just under 300 square feet. It was designed by Tom Kundig, the architect who founded the Seattle-based firm Olson Kundig. Known for its buildings with moving parts -- from hand-cranked glass walls to camping huts mounted on enormous casters -- the firm actually has a staff member with the job title of gizmologist: Phil Turner, who specializes in making some of Mr. Kundig's more audacious ideas reality.
But even a studio railroad initially seemed like the stuff of dreams. "I just said, offhand, 'Wouldn't it be cool if you could just take that office, that studio, and put it on tracks,"' recalled Mr. Kundig, describing the meeting where he listened to Mr. Maxon explain his desire for a home office that could provide isolation. "It was a joke."
But the more they batted the idea around, the more appealing it seemed -- and the more daunting. "It's a really simple idea, but requires all sorts of craziness to get there," Mr. Kundig said. "It's one thing to draw it, but it's another thing to deliver it."
In other words, he said, "I didn't know how to pull something like this off."
Mr. Maxon first met Mr. Kundig in 2008, shortly after he and his wife, Kim Maxon, 52, bought their 21.5-acre lot outside Seattle for around $ 328,000, with the idea of building a modernist home they could share with their children, Henry, now 23, Jack, 20, and Charlie, 16. Ms. Maxon gave her husband a book about Mr. Kundig's work as a Christmas gift and, flipping through its pages, they decided he was the architect for the job.
The process of designing and building the house took longer than they expected because of challenges with the steep site and the intricacies of obtaining a construction loan following the financial crisis. When the house was finally completed in 2016, Mr. Maxon dove head first into the design and construction of his rolling studio.
Naturally curious and keen to prove that the idea could be realized, Mr. Maxon decided he wouldn't just be the conductor of the finished structure -- he would also be the general contractor and personally work through the details, find the necessary materials and parts, and orchestrate the construction.
"Between 2016 and 2018, it was a lot of research," he said. "I approached the studio like I would any project." He read about railroads that used to run through the area, befriended workers at a nearby rail yard and spent vacations riding the rails.
"I went crazy for trains," he said. "I found myself, on a Sunday afternoon, at a train show. We took the Empire Builder, which was the original Great Northern, from Seattle to Chicago and back. I went on a trip to Japan with my son, and we went on trains."
To build his own railroad, Mr. Maxon sourced reclaimed rails from Harmer Steel that were once used by the Great Northern Railway. To ensure that the rails remained flat and straight, excavators dug deep into the earth along the desired route and filled the void with 27 dump-truck loads of stone track ballast.
To construct the studio building, Mr. Maxon worked with Alpine Welding and Equipment, a frequent Olson Kundig collaborator.
Such an unconventional project was "tantalizing to people like us," said Tim Odell, the owner of the company, who not only did the steelwork but also helped Mr. Maxon assemble the systems that would make the studio move, working with his employee Jesse Thomson. "When you start talking about a project where we can do something that's kinetic, we get really excited."
Alpine prefabricated most of the structure in sections before craning and connecting the pieces on the rails. Inside, the studio is finished in more steel, plywood and exposed electrical conduit. The first floor has a desk and serves as Mr. Maxon's primary work space. The second floor, reached by a ladder, is his library.
The 35,000-pound structure sits on custom-made wheels emblazoned with Mr. Maxon's professional logo and is powered by an electric engine connected to a retracting wire hidden behind one of the rails. For the controls, Mr. Maxon found a vintage General Motors Electro-Motive Division control panel from South Korea on eBay, after one of his rail yard friends told him what to look for.
One of the levers on the control panel sets the direction and another adjusts the throttle, but there was one lever left over, Mr. Maxon said: "We didn't need the dynamic brake function."
Soon, however, he realized that it would be difficult to climb up to his library while carrying books or a laptop. So Mr. Odell and Mr. Thomson devised a dumbwaiter powered by a small conveyer-belt motor, which they installed beside the ladder and wired to that extra lever.
The rolling building was completed in November 2022, at a total cost of about $ 375,000, including the structure and the railroad.
The first time Ms. Maxon saw the studio move, she could barely believe her eyes. "I'm not the visionary in the family -- that's Lou. So I was a little apprehensive before it got built, because I couldn't picture it," she said. "But the first time they ran it down the tracks, I was just flabbergasted and in awe."
Although Mr. Maxon has finished building his personal railroad, his new passion seems to have stuck. This summer, he said, "we fly to London to see our son, but then we're taking the train up to Edinburgh." Next year, he and Ms. Maxon are planning a similar train trip in Japan. Professionally, he has also started working on a few railway museum projects.
"I'm just part of the railroad community now," he said, noting that he has filled his studio with related memorabilia, including a model train, a vintage first-aid kit and a Great Northern Railway sign. "In addition to being a studio, it's a bit of a mini moving monument to the railroads."

Full text: TAMPA, Fla. -- Did you hear about the women who hid all night underneath the truck?
Rumors were flying outside the Raymond James Stadium more than 36 hours before Taylor Swift took the stage of the 75,000-seat site on Florida's west coast.
They went from person to person, as in a children's game of telephone. But the lines outside the stadium last week were made up of fans of all ages willing to put up with hours of discomfort to buy souvenirs tied to the singer's Eras Tour. Many of them arrived well before sunrise.
When word went out that certain prize items might be sold out, some Swifties spoke darkly of resellers with suitcases who had bought up boxes of T-shirts and sweatshirts at previous tour stops. There was also talk that a couple of women had spent the night beneath a merchandise truck.
That turned out to be true. One of the women, Larisa Roberts, had the selfies to prove it -- grainy photos showing that she and a friend had spent hours taking shelter from the rain under the official Eras truck.
"No one was here," Ms. Roberts, an interior decorator from Trinity, Fla., said of the scene outside the stadium when she arrived between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. on Wednesday. She added that she planned to buy sweatshirts for her daughters, Lilly and Daisy.
Shirley Vogler, a nurse in Tampa, said she had made it to the Eras truck at 10 p.m. the night before. Like other early arrivals, she had been moved from spot to spot by security guards in the rainy predawn hours. At 5:45 a.m., she was among the hundreds of people camped out on a sidewalk next to the six-lane West Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Ms. Vogler, 31, was seated on the ground toward the front, chatting with two other women whom she had befriended.
Fans were able to buy merchandise inside the stadium on each of the three nights that Ms. Swift would perform at the home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. So why bother waiting all night in the rain? Ms. Vogler, who had tickets to a show, said it was because of what she had seen on social media -- specifically, "the TikToks about how bad all of the arenas are with the merch lines and the traffic."
Several other fans mentioned having seen posts by Bailey McKnight-Howard, one half of the twin influencer duo @brooklynandbailey, an Instagram account with nearly nine million followers. A few days earlier, Ms. McKnight-Howard had put up pictures of herself waiting outside AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.
She had also modeled a newly purchased blue crew neck sweatshirt, the most-sought after item among fans. Nearly every person outside the stadium on Wednesday morning was trying to buy one, or two, or as many as they were allowed to have.
There was nothing flashy about it. The sweatshirt had no sequins or embroidery or hidden pockets. It was just your average everyday sweatshirt, with Ms. Swift's name and "Eras Tour" printed across the front and the tour dates and the titles of her albums on the back. If you closed your eyes and conjured a blue crew neck sweatshirt with some writing on it, your mental image would probably match up with this in-demand item.
One thing that made it special was the fact that, unlike some other tour souvenirs, it was not available in the "merch" section of taylorswift.com. It was also, notably, the rare garment for sale that day without Ms. Swift's face printed on it. In the weeks since the start of the Eras Tour, fans had elevated this unexceptional article of clothing to cult status.
"Every Swiftie wants the blue crew," said Debbie Losee, a 60-year-old teacher who said she was waiting in line on behalf of her daughter.
The apparently limited supply made it even more prized. "The resale on the sweatshirts is $ 300, Jake!" one fan was heard shouting into her phone. She was correct. The sweatshirt is available on eBay for more than four times its $ 65 list price.
"I've been having nightmares about getting this crew neck," said Emily Rottkamp, a 20-year-old employee at Disney World. "I haven't been sleeping."
Alyssa Misay, a personal injury specialist from Land O' Lakes, Fla., joined the line before 5:30 a.m. She said her teenage niece had given her strict instructions: "'The sweatshirt, the sweatshirt!"'
"Social media just makes things a bigger deal than what they are -- like, almost unattainable," Ms. Misay, 36, said. "Like, if you don't have it, you're not cool in school."
Nearby, Venisha Jardin, a sophomore at Wiregrass Ranch High School in Wesley Chapel, Fla., wore a hooded plastic poncho to protect her from the rain. In the hours before sunrise, the glow from her phone illuminated the area around her. "I'm missing school for this," she said.
Her mother, Chrys, was sitting in a nearby parked car.
"I was like, 'There's no way I'm missing merch just to go to school,"' Ms. Jardin said, describing how she had managed to convince her parents. She added that she planned to buy at least five items, including the you know what.
Despite the chill in the air and the steady drizzle, spirits were high. Gina Delano, 27, walked up and down the sidewalk telling people she had a cooler full of free snacks and drinks. Wearing a cardigan that had gone on sale at taylorswift.com at the time of the singer's 2020 album "Folklore" (which includes the song "Cardigan"), Ms. Delano said she had traveled from her home near Buffalo.
"The weather could definitely be better," she said, "but if this is what it takes to get merch, then this is what we'll do."
Elsewhere in the line, Jess Montgomery, a wedding photographer from Dade City, Fla., cradled her 7-week-old son, Denver, in a blanket. Standing beside her was her 11-year-old niece. "I'll be 40 next year," Ms. Montgomery said, "and when she's my age I want her to look back and say, 'My aunt was super cool."' She added that she had struck out in her attempts to score tickets for any of the three sold-out Tampa shows.
The people outside the stadium included teenagers who had never known a world in which Ms. Swift wasn't an international superstar and women who had grown up alongside the 33-year-old singer. The hours of waiting gave them a chance to feel at home among hundreds of others who shared a love for Ms. Swift's songs about high school bullies and first loves, about heartbreak and loss.
"The worst kind of person is someone who makes someone feel bad, dumb or stupid for being excited about something," Ms. Swift said in a 2019 interview. It's a line that her fans have often quoted on social media in reply to the haters.
Shortly after 7 a.m., Matt Langel, a Tampa resident, was sitting on the sidewalk decked out in Pittsburgh Steelers gear while his daughter, Alexis, filmed the scene for her mother. Ms. Swift's music had become a lifeline for the family, Mr. Langel said, adding that his wife was disabled. "My wife, since she's been bedridden, pretty much Taylor is what got her through," Mr. Langel said.
At 8 a.m., two hours before the merchandise was to go on sale, stadium workers opened the parking lot. Some fans tried to respect the existing line as others rushed toward the front. Because many people had been waiting at different locations, there was a scramble. Fans who tried to abide by an honor system found themselves more or less out of luck.
"Everyone started running from all different directions," Ms. Roberts, the woman from under the truck, said after she had managed to secure a spot near the front of the line.
Farther back, some people squabbled with those trying to cut in. "Back of the line or I'm going to have to put you in jail," an officer with the Tampa Police Department can be heard saying in a video of the scene recorded by a fan and reviewed by The New York Times. Some people cheered as several of the apparent line-cutters obeyed his order.
As 10 a.m. approached, local TV news crews showed up to interview fans, and a helicopter whirred not far above the merch truck. Strong winds whipped across the lot, stirring up dust. Tears streamed down Haylee Lewis's face.
"I just feel like camping overnight is a little much," said Ms. Lewis, a 21-year-old college student who lives in Orlando. The line was already over 1,000 people long when she had arrived at 8:30 a.m., she added. "I understand it, maybe, for concert tickets, but for the merch line it's actually insane," she said.
There turned out to be two trucks selling merchandise. Next to the Eras truck, which was patterned with images of Ms. Swift's face, there was a plain black truck topped with a sign reading "COOL STUFF" in big red letters. Both trucks sold the same items.
Inside the trucks, sales people prepared for the rush, unpacking boxes of shirts, tote bags, light wands and posters. They wore black Eras Tour T-shirts, the same ones they would be selling for $ 45 apiece. (Online, some fans have complained that certain shirts fade noticeably after washing.) There was one rule for the day: only two blue crew neck sweatshirts per customer.
At 10 a.m., the line lurched forward. A pair of AirPods flew into the air and landed on the ground, their owner seemingly oblivious. Things progressed slowly as the fans who made it to the very front asked to see various sizes and mulled their options. The mood was tense but jovial.
Less than an hour later, the vibe shifted as word circulated that the prize sweatshirts had sold out. Anna Avgoustis, a 26-year-old fan, got one of the last ones.
"By the time I got to the front, they were taking them off the wall," she said. "I was like: 'Please give me the last one. I will do anything for you. I'll run you guys Starbucks."' A few hours later, true to her word, she returned with coffees for the sales crew.
Kristi Kall, 38, and her daughter, Kaylee, 11, said they would try to buy a sweatshirt at the concert. "I just wish they would have had a little bit more, because they knew that's what everybody wanted," Ms. Kall said.
"I'm a little upset," said Kaylee, who bought an Eras Tour-branded water bottle instead.
In the afternoon, Laura Gavagan, a 33-year-old fan in Baltimore who had come directly from the airport, joined the line outside the truck, her suitcase rolling behind her. "I'm getting some looks," she said.
Jaclyn Quinn, a high school English teacher from Joliet, Ill., said that Ms. Swift's work came in handy in her lessons. "We use 'The Man' to teach critical lenses and talk about the feminist lens versus the genderqueer lens," she said. "We use her song 'Bad Blood' to talk about metaphor." She bought an Eras Tour wall tapestry for her classroom.
As 5 p.m. approached, the salespeople began straightening up the trucks and peeling off the tour T-shirts. When asked if they got to keep the shirts they had worn that day, one of the workers said, "No." Instead, they folded them and returned them to the stacks to be sold to the next day's fans.
"Isn't that so gross?" the salesperson said. "Don't tell."

Full text: Esé Azénabor-Grembowski talked about her inspirations for her ornate wedding gowns, opening her second boutique on Madison Avenue and debuting at New York Bridal Fashion Week this month.
The designer Esé Azénabor-Grembowski has gained a following in the last few years for her grand wedding dresses with dramatic silhouettes and detachable pieces. Stylists and Hollywood celebrities have requested her designs for red carpet events, TV appearances and weddings.
She was even mentioned in the 2022 remake of the film "Father of the Bride," alongside two of her idols, Vera Wang and Zuhair Murad. "To be included with these two iconic designers is such an honor," said Mrs. Azénabor-Grembowski, who migrated from Nigeria to Ontario, Canada, with her family in 1997 when she was 10. She moved to Dallas in 2011 for a graduate program in accounting at Southern Methodist University and has lived in the city since then.
"As a Black woman in this industry and knowing from where I came from to where I am today, it's truly incredible," she said.
Big, traditional Nigerian weddings inspire Mrs. Azénabor-Grembowski's designs. "I loved seeing what family and friends wore to weddings," she said. "Their dresses were made of traditional Nigerian fabrics featuring different colors and patterns, like ashoké and ankara, embellished with 3-D appliqué. Those dresses help influence what I think a wedding dress should look like."
In February, Mrs. Azénabor-Grembowski expanded her brand beyond her Dallas flagship showroom and atelier by opening a second boutique, during New York Fashion Week, on Madison Avenue. And she showed her first bridal runway collection, Essence, during the New York Bridal Fashion Week, which began on April 11.
You originally planned to be an accountant. When did you start designing clothes?
I studied accounting to please my traditional Nigerian parents, who wanted me to follow a practical career. But I have always been fascinated by fabric, and how clothes are made, since I was a kid. I used to take apart my mom's clothing and put them back together. In elementary school in Nigeria, I had to a wear a uniform, but once a month we'd get to wear our own clothing. One time I took my dad's trousers and remade them for me with beading and different construction. My classmates asked if I could make a pair for them, and they would bring their dads' pants to me to reconstruct for them.
As I got older, I continued to make clothes for family and friends, and while at university, I'd design my own clothes for social events. But I never thought it was going to be my career or anything serious. I thought I would do it just for fun. Then, to make extra money, I started selling my designs on eBay. I'd buy a yard of fabric here and there, go to vintage shops to get as much beaded fabric as possible and made my own creations by mixing fabrics together.
How did you start your brand?
In 2012, a friend told me I had a lot of talent for making clothes and suggested that I do a fashion show. I started researching how to put one together and reached out to Rhonda Sargent Chambers, who's a former model and well known for producing the biggest fashion shows in Dallas. She offered to produce my show for free in exchange that I made a dress for her. Being able to say that Rhonda Sargent Chambers produced my show was a big deal; it brought out the who's who of fashion in Dallas.
I dropped out the second semester of my first year in grad school, where I was continuing my studies in accounting, to make my collection. I launched my evening wear line that year.
When did you focus on bridal?
One of my clients I designed gala dresses for was getting married in 2015 and asked me to make her dresses for her ceremony and reception. She was very prominent in the community and having a big Jewish wedding. She wanted two heavily beaded dresses, and I only had two months to do it. At the time, I was a one-woman show, so I hired someone to help me, and we sewed and beaded all day, slept, woke up and worked all day again.
The bride posted her photos on her social media and they went viral. So many people started calling, asking me to make their dresses for their galas, parties and weddings. That's when I realized how special it was to make someone's wedding dress. It's very different than making a dress for other events. A wedding dress is something they've dreamed of wearing since they were little girls, and I helped make that dream come true.
I originally started with only bespoke gowns, then started my first bridal collection in 2020. Designing bridal gowns expanded my creativity. It challenged me to use texture to make a white dress pop like one in color would. It's pushed me to learn and perfect details like corseting and matching illusion tulle to the bride's skin tone.
What inspires your designs?
My inspiration comes from my love of fabrics and mixing colors and textures. I look at a fabric and can see a dress I want to create. I'm also inspired by beads and jewels, which in my culture have meaning. They can represent happiness or the social status of the bride's family. And I'm inspired by my travels and what's around me. If I see a tall building in Dubai, I imagine a beautiful silver dress.
Who is your bride?
She's worldly, loves art and culture, and is super confident. She's definitely not a wallflower. My bride doesn't buy a piece just because it's by a big name like Dior or Versace -- she buys it because it's unique and speaks to her. I design for the bride who wants an opulent, ornate gown. She comes to me to create a dress that's sparkly and over-the-top, but also timeless.
What do your designs offer your brides?
I want to help a bride celebrate herself on her big day. I want her to know that a lot of love and attention was put into what she's wearing for her wedding. I design gowns for when a bride walks into a room and everyone's mouth drops. She can be as extra as she wants; it's her day. Family and friends are coming from all over, and you don't want them to just look at the flowers and cake -- you want them looking at you. Your dress should be something to remember.
How do your bespoke and your ready-to-wear Prêt Marièe lines differ?
My bespoke dresses are one of a kind and made totally from scratch. They start from a sketch and I show the bride fabric swatches, ask specific questions, like which of her features she'd like to highlight. Then I create the gown.
Prêt Marièe is more a ready-to-wear line from which a bride can choose her dress as is and order to her measurements. Or she can customize her gown by combining elements from different looks within the Prêt Marièe collection.
What types of fabric and embellishments do you use?
I love to use raw silk because it's stiff and fun to manipulate. I also use a lot of silk organza. For embellishments, I like to mix different types of stones and beads, including Swarovski, seed beads, pearls and Japanese glass stones to create texture and dimension. I like to combine them all into 3-D floral artwork.
How did you decide on Madison Avenue for your New York boutique?
I was obsessed with having a boutique on Madison Avenue since the first time I visited New York City in 2010. I remember saying out loud, "One day I will have a store here." And then laughed at myself, thinking how big a dream it was for me. But fast forward to today and the dream has come true.
It was a no-brainer to open a boutique in New York: I was having an overwhelming response from brides whenever I did a three-day pop-up trunk show at the Plaza Hotel. I've done pop-ups in Miami, Chicago and Los Angeles, as well, and those appointments took a few weeks to fill up. But the appointments for my New York pop-ups filled within 48 hours, even in the middle of Covid.

Pre-rolled Joints and TikTok Feuds: This Is the Diamond District?

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — Zev Weitman’s angular frame was hunched over his sooty workbench in a cramped diamond-cutting shop several floors above the buzz of Manhattan’s diamond district. But his mind was roaming a crystalline chamber, tweaking facets to coax a brilliant symphony of light from the diamond he was working against a cutting wheel.
“I’m always improvising, always searching for the perfect cut,” said Weitman, 68, who began cutting in the district four decades ago, when thousands of jewelry businesses studded a single block of 47th Street. Back then, there were also thousands of cutters like Weitman, many of them shaping and perfecting diamonds from rough stones straight out of mines.
Now, Weitman said, only a few hundred remain in the district, focusing on repairs, rush jobs and the kind of high-end work he does. His dozen apprentices are gone, and he labors and obsesses over the stones by himself — working at the wheel or solving problems in bed, in the shower or in stolen overnight naps on his coat on the shop’s tile floor. None of his four children — nor, presumably, any of his 28 grandchildren — will follow him into his trade.
The death of the diamond district has been foretold for years. Most diamond-cutting work has been outsourced to factories overseas. Online shopping has cut into showroom sales. The pandemic lockdown derailed supply and devastated foot traffic. Inexpensive lab-grown diamonds resembling real ones have rattled a seemingly unshakable diamond economy. Many long-standing family shops have downsized or lack succession plans. Booth vacancies in once-bustling jewelry exchanges are a common sight.
And now, the inevitable: A megadeveloper has demolished more than a dozen buildings in the district to make way for two huge structures, a supertall tower and a luxury hotel. This, some old-school jewelers fear, will change the unique character of the diamond district.
But there is another facet to this gloomy prognosis.
Right across the street from where Weitman was sweating out the perfect cut is a glittering storefront counter awash in rap star bling. The aura of the shop, TraxNYC, could not be more different from the Old World austerity of Weitman’s cutting studio.
Showcases are filled with jewel-encrusted pendants, and gold chains drip from graffitied jewelry stands tended by a young, diverse sales staff that would not look out of place at a Brooklyn dance club.
In the rear of the showroom is a staircase that leads to the VIP lounge, where the unmistakable fragrance of marijuana lingers and preferred customers peruse jewelry served up by employees along with complimentary diversions: premium liquor, pre-rolled joints, a video game console.
Where past generations of diamond cutters might have hunkered down, TraxNYC has a team of 20-somethings sitting at a common table, noisily handling online and phone sales and taking custom orders started on the spot with design software and 3D printers.
“We’re transforming the industry, and these are the young people who will be taking it over,” said the owner, Maksud Agadjani, 36, whose designs are popular with clients like Cardi B and Busta Rhymes.
“People may want to watch the old diamond district in movies and on TV, but the truth is people don’t want to go to the diamond district anymore,” Agadjani said. “So the old ways have to get ripped up.”
But the old ways are not gone yet. As midtown has been transformed by tourism, soaring commercial rents and proliferating chain stores, the diamond district seems to stand out more than ever as an anachronism.
Compared with the high-end flagship shops on Fifth Avenue — Cartier, Harry Winston, Tiffany & Co. — 47th Street feels like a time warp. Makeshift synagogues and kosher eateries are wedged between jewelry office suites. On the sidewalk, Hasidic diamond dealers haggle on flip phones while groups of men smoke and banter in various languages and hawkers try to lure passersby into showrooms.
Agadjani sneers at all that. Who needs a hawker when his Instagram posts and TikTok videos bring in millions of views a day? “We do $20 million on the daily between all of us,” he said, referring to the volume of the whole district. He has now been on the block for 18 years, and his shop does more than $30 million in annual sales.
He started the company with a high school graduation gift of $1,500 and sold jewelry on consignment on eBay. Now he focuses on popularizing his brand through social media, publicity stunts and a YouTube reality show called “The District.”
He gets lots of mileage out of beefs with rappers and reality show stars. His feud with Brooklyn-based rapper Tekashi69 became publicity pay dirt when 50 Cent came to Tekashi’s defense and called Agadjani a “sucker.” It didn’t matter that Agadjani was ridiculed — the post went viral.
“The past is the past, and things are evolving super quickly,” he said. “While one part of the district is dying, another part is being born.”
New York’s Most Precious Export
With all due respect to Agadjani’s swagger, he did not invent the 47th Street hustle.
The jewelry district in New York emerged in the 1800s as a cluster of shops in lower Manhattan. Later on, Jewish diamond merchants fleeing Europe before World War II began setting up on 47th Street.
Much of the industry’s roots in Orthodox Jewish parts of Eastern Europe is reflected in the block’s own vocabulary, largely Yiddish. A “strop” is a second-rate stone that won’t sell; it’s “khazeray” or “shlok” — garbage. Merchants share a secret code to freely discuss a “gee,” or customer. A “2-10” is a warning to keep “two eyes on 10 fingers” when serving a potential thief.
This secret world is revealed on the upper floors above the showrooms in a honeycomb of cramped workshops, retail stalls and anonymous office suites. Here, the polishers, sorters, appraisers, graders and bench jewelers toil behind locked double-door vestibules (“man-traps”) that allow visitors to be checked before entry and exit.
Even with all the challenges, jewelry, gems and precious metals from the diamond district are still among New York state’s most valuable exports, and the stores around 47th Street make up the largest diamond market in the country, a conduit for an estimated 90% of the diamonds imported into the United States. High-end pieces that end up for sale at Tiffany and Harry Winston often begin their lives here as raw material.
“I mean, other than bagels, what else is made in New York anymore?” said Romy Schreiber, whose grandmother started Gumuchian Jewelry, one of the only matrilineal businesses that have endured among diamond dealers.
The district can be intimidating to outsiders not accustomed to the hard sell.
On a recent weekday, a woman holding a cardboard sign — “WE BUY CASH LOAN” — tried to flag down passersby on the block. The woman, Mirta Kuzmana, is perhaps the only female hawker there. She can speak five languages, including her native Latvian, and makes $70 a day luring customers into a pawnshop.
“I show you the best deals anywhere,” she said to a family of tourists. They declined and sidestepped her, and she directed her sidewalk pitch to the next comers.
Across the street, Richie Winick leaned over the display case of his stall in a bustling exchange.
“It’s not beautiful like Madison Avenue, but if you know the people you’re dealing with, you’ll pay much less,” Winick said. Now 62, he runs the jewelry company his father started almost 70 years ago. Compared with Weitman’s laborious craftsmanship or Agadjani’s social media savvy, his business is more representative of the district, though he has rolled with the times by sharing office space with an Indian firm that specializes in lab-grown diamonds.
Still, the old-school barter economy persists. Many deals are done on credit, with millions of dollars entrusted to a handwritten memo and a handshake and a blessing of “mazel und brucha” — Yiddish for “luck and blessing.”
“You can have a $10 million deal just by signing your name,” Winick said. “Where else can you do that?”
A customer appeared in his shop looking for a diamond ring for his girlfriend, and Winick went into his spiel. “Here, look at this,” he began. “This is a $200,000 stone at Tiffany’s, but you save 50 cents on the dollar by shopping on 47th Street.” The customer opted for a smaller diamond. A good choice, Winick told him.
“You know the 11th Commandment, right?” he added. “Thou shalt not pay retail.”
It is unclear where modernization will leave someone like Weitman, who regards his 40-year career as an obsessive quest for the ultimate cut that makes a diamond dazzle with light. He called it a mystical pursuit that blends optical physics, the eye of an artist and the touch of a surgeon. One of his devoted following of dealers referred to him as “the man with the diamond eyes.”
In the cutting room, he resembled a painter at his canvas, pulling back periodically to evaluate his work by lifting the gem to an overhead lamp. He peered through a magnifying loupe into its tiny twinkling windows to inspect cuts made for maximum brilliance and scintillation crucial to the stone’s beauty.
Ideas for new designs germinate without warning and are fleshed out through trial and error. But they are executed in the shop, where he can spend weeks on a single stone.
“When you’re cutting, there is nothing else,” said Weitman, who has spent all-nighters lost in his work in the shop. “It’s like watching Michael Jordan play against the Knicks. It’s excitement beyond anything you could imagine.”
Cutters work under high pressure. They must preserve valuable carat weight while managing the constant risk of shattering the gem with a single misplaced cut. “If you hit a gletz” — an imperfection — “it can shatter,” Weitman said. “Sometimes it can’t be prevented. It’s a terrible feeling.”
One of Weitman’s dealers, Charles Paskesz, 53, started as a diamond cutter, but while he was working on a $15,000 stone, it suddenly shattered. Plagued with nightmares, he quit cutting.
“I never put another stone on the wheel,” said Paskesz, now a diamond dealer with IGC Group, a large Belgian company with an office in the district.
The Influencer and the Artisan
The stakes are also high for the new breed of diamond dealers. A showroom down the block from TraxNYC that also caters to a hip-hop clientele was held up by armed robbers several years back and now has security guards who look like nightclub bouncers.
For Agadjani, who grew up in Rego Park, Queens, after his parents emigrated from Azerbaijan when he was 7, this is the culture he knows. “My father told me, ‘This is a place with real opportunity,’” said Agadjani, who graduated from Forest Hills High School. “I sized up America quick enough.”
At one point he dressed one of his sales agents in a squirrel costume to make another goofball post goading a rival. Nothing like a good social media beef to flog the brand.
Agadjani’s recent social media dust-up with Scott Disick, an influencer and reality TV star on “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” turned into marketing gold. Calling out Disick on Instagram was a boon for the jeweler’s brand, as was the very public way Agadjani delivered a custom-made gremlin necklace to Kodak Black: He strolled onstage at a concert in Miami and fastened it around his neck as a sea of smartphones captured the moment.
As much as Agadjani may distance himself from the diamond district’s more traditional business methods, he will admit one thing: Location is crucial.
“I’m not getting my jewelry from Walmart,” he said. “I have to manufacture it, and this block is a factory. Everyone is critical. One guy’s polishing, another guy’s casting, another’s soldering. This guy’s setting gemstones, that guy’s an enameler.”
Although Agadjani and Weitman seem like opposites, they are similar in their obsessional pursuit as jewelers, to the point of losing sleep.
“I’d like to meet him,” Agadjani said as his team slapped some taunting graphics on the squirrel video and posted it. “Guys like him — that’s why I’m here.”

What Won't People Buy In a Bid For the Past: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Just about everyone has somewhere special they went when young, a place that glows in memory. For some it may be a library or game arcade, for others a baseball field or bookstore. For Jay Carlson, growing up in western Massachusetts in the early 1990s, the center of the universe was the video rental store.
This was before streaming, before Netflix, before DVDs. The videocassette player was the summit of consumer technology. At the rental shop, 12-year-old Jay would bump into friends and neighbors, hear about something that couldn't be missed, talk up his own favorites. It was like social media before social media was invented.
He grew up, got married, had children, went to work in the finance department of a retailer. Technology moved on, but his heart did not. One day, he saw in his local comics store a tape of "Ghostbusters," the first movie his parents let him pick out himself. It was $ 7, still sealed from the factory.
"I said to my wife, 'I think I might start collecting tapes,"' Mr. Carlson, 43, said. "I was taking a piece of my childhood back."
Many others are, too. The stock market, real estate and cryptocurrencies did poorly in 2022, but the global luxury goods market grew 20 percent. People may have had less, but they spent more on fine arts and collectibles that serve no function except to provide pleasure.
The culture is bursting with new material -- every day, thousands of new books are published and 100,000 new songs are released on Spotify -- but the old stuff offers a sweeter emotional payoff for many. It could be tapes or posters or pictures or comics or coins or sports cards or memorabilia. It might be from their childhood or the childhood they never had, or it might merely express a longing to be anywhere but 2023.
The common element is this: People like to own a thing from a thing they love. For Mr. Carlson and millions like him, the nostalgia factory is working overtime.
When Mr. Carlson first began to look for sealed VHS cassettes, they were considered so much plastic trash. "Back to the Future," "The Goonies," "Blade Runner," were about $ 20 each on eBay. He put them on a shelf, little windows into his past, and started an Instagram account called Rare and Sealed.
Then tapes began to get scarcer and much more expensive. People trapped at home had lots of money to spend during the pandemic. But it was more than that.
Objects with a bit of history have an obvious attraction in a high-tech world. The current cultural tumult, with its boom in fake images, endless arguments over everything and now the debut of imperious A.I. chatbots, increases the appeal of things that can't be plugged in.
At the same time, advances in technology mean it is ever easier to buy expensive things online. Bids at auctions routinely reach tens, even hundreds, of thousands of dollars.
One thing people are eagerly seeking with the new technology is old technology. Cormac McCarthy's typewriter, which he used to write a shelf of important novels, went for a quarter-million dollars. An Apple 1 computer fetched nearly twice that. A first-generation iPhone, still sealed in its box, sold for $ 21,000 in December and triple that in February.
Blend these factors -- a desire for escape from our virtual lives; bidding as fast as pushing a button; and the promotion of new collecting fields like outdated technology devices -- and you have Heritage Auctions in Dallas.
Heritage is a whirlwind of activity, of passion, of hype, constantly trying new ways of enticing people to own something beautiful and useless. Ninety-one million Americans, according to U.S. Census Bureau surveys, are having trouble paying household bills. Everyone else is a potential bidder.
"There was a point in time when art and collectibles were dominated by old white men," said Josh Benesh, Heritage's chief strategy officer. "I think that has been democratized. And the categories of material for sale have been democratized a lot."
Twenty years ago, Heritage had four categories: coins, comics, movie posters and sports. Now it has more than 50, which generated revenue of $ 1.4 billion last year. Everything, at least in theory, is collectible.
"We don't question the value or legitimacy of a particular subject matter relative to outmoded norms," Mr. Benesh said. "We're not here to tell you what's worthwhile. The marketplace will tell you. The bidders" -- Heritage has 1.6 million -- "will tell you."
VHS tapes were apparently worthwhile. The selection of an expert to run the sales was easy: Mr. Carlson. His first auction, in June 2022, brought in more than a half-million dollars.
The publicity around the sale brought Mr. Carlson, whose email address is on the Heritage website, many offers of tapes. One man said he had put together a time capsule for his son, who was born on Christmas Day 1982. "Rocky III" had just come out, so the father included a brand-new copy. He threw in "Rocky I" and "Rocky II" as well. They'd cost $ 60 each.
The three tapes, all with a factory seal, fetched $ 53,750 in a February auction.
Since cassettes were designed to be played, only a few unopened ones exist 40 years later. But since they were never considered valuable, they might be found anywhere for a pittance.
"A man told us he found a sealed first release of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' at Goodwill," Mr. Carlson said. "He paid a quarter. That will probably go for $ 20,000."
Every potential bidder must decide if this is the 2023 equivalent of Beanie Babies, which flew high and then crashed. Mr. Carlson would not be working at Heritage if he didn't believe.
"These tapes are historical artifacts that have this ability to sweep you back in time to a place that all at once feels miles away and yet somehow like home," he said. "I used to think it was just me, but I talk to more and more people getting into this because of that pull."
The pull of nostalgia is powerful indeed. But the pull of quick cash can be more powerful still. There were 235 lots in February's tape auction, and they all sold.
For those who missed out, dozens of the lots are now highlighted on Heritage's website to suggest the owner might be willing to flip his newly acquired copy of "Caddyshack" for a 50 percent premium.
At Heritage, the bidding never really ends.
Wanted Dead or Alive
The Heritage offices look like a cross between an Amazon warehouse and a very wide-ranging museum, with a dash of "Hoarders" thrown in.
In mid-2020, the privately held company moved to a 160,000-square-foot building by Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, doubling the size of its former headquarters. Hundreds of specialists, most of them collectors themselves, prepare hundreds of thousands of items for bids here -- researching, photographing, writing catalog copy.
There are boxes of Teenage Mutant Turtles Killer Bee toys. A CBS television camera that filmed the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald. A poster from the McKinley campaign in 1896. Lots of Pokémon. Fake newspapers from the HBO series "Watchmen." Lots and lots of comic books. A videocassette of the horror flick "Death Spa." Sneakers. Trading cards.
Stuff overwhelms desks; objects are piled to the ceilings in storage rooms; racks are full of items that have been bought and must be shipped.
The spiritual roots of Heritage, which calls itself "America's auction house," go back to the most primitive type of collector, the souvenir hunter. Anything not nailed down in America, along with quite a bit that is, becomes prey. Traveling through Missouri in 1882, Oscar Wilde noticed a crowd pulling down a little yellow house.
"It is the house of the great train-robber and murderer, Jesse James, who was shot by his pal last week, and the people are relic hunters," the playwright reported. "They sold his dustbin and foot-scraper yesterday at public auction, his door-knocker is to be offered for sale this afternoon, the reserve price being about the income of an English bishop."
Wilde added that Americans "are great hero-worshippers, and always take their heroes from the criminal classes." That's as true as ever. A few months ago, Heritage sold the outlaw's pocket revolver for $ 62,500.
The problem is, older historical items that were previously unknown are becoming rare. Every barn, basement and attic has been ransacked for treasures. New items related to Washington or Lincoln, for instance, are nearly impossible to find.
"All the varieties of Lincoln inaugural buttons seem to be known," said Curtis Lindner, Heritage's director of Americana. "There has not been a new photo of Lincoln in many years. We get a lot of people saying, 'I have a new image.' Unfortunately, not everyone who has a beard is Abraham Lincoln."
So the pressure is on to develop new material. For instance, Vegas casino chips. "People have emotional ties to Vegas," said Ray Farina, who moved over from Americana to develop this niche. "Maybe they saw Elvis there back in the day."
A 1953 chip from the fabled Sands casino sold for $ 12,000 at Heritage in December. Now people with chips are contacting Heritage. A guy says his father worked for the casinos taking the decommissioned chips out to the desert to bury them in concrete. Apparently, he kept some.
"Word gets out," Mr. Farina said. "We have tremendous marketing ability here."
The pace of Heritage's auctions is relentless -- there were 1,034 in 2022, almost three a day, with a total of 412,270 lots -- and so are the Heritage emails promoting them.
Even so, revenue barely inched up in 2022 after growing 60 percent in 2021. The number of registered bidders rose, but only by a small fraction. There may be a limit to what marketing can do.
Looking for a Sure Thing
Sitting in his office on a rainy Monday morning, Chris Ivy, the director of sports auctions at Heritage, is a bit distracted. That's because he is talking about auctions while simultaneously bidding for Heritage on a Michael Jordan jersey being auctioned by a competitor.
Last summer, Heritage sold a Mickey Mantle rookie card for $ 12.6 million, which it billed as the most valuable sports collectible ever sold at auction. The clothing actually worn by players seems to Mr. Ivy undervalued by comparison.
He suspects this Jordan jersey, which is being sold as nothing special, was worn in a game. "It has a downside of maybe $ 5,000 and an upside of $ 100,000. I'll take that every day of the week," he says. "We use our expertise here to help generate income."
Mr. Ivy wins the jersey for about $ 20,000. To try to authenticate it, he will use a photo-matching service, which will scour the internet for proof that it is what he thinks it is. When a historical object is validated with contemporary images, bidders are encouraged.
A recent Heritage auction featured a 1948 Joe DiMaggio jersey. What made it special was the black armband attached to the left sleeve, a tribute to Babe Ruth after his death on Aug. 16 of that year. The Yankees' two greatest stars were thus linked for a few weeks.
The jersey was being sold by a collector, and there was no direct connection to DiMaggio. So Heritage sent photographs of it to Resolution Photomatching in Seattle.
Resolution found a contemporary picture that showed DiMaggio apparently wearing the shirt, although without the mourning band. The tiny imperfections in the flannel were the same. The jersey sold for $ 564,000.
Data can mislead as well as illuminate. Two years ago, an Australian gamer named Karl Jobst released a popular video that made allegations of fraud against Heritage. The company responded that it "has always acted with the utmost integrity and has never falsely inflated the collector video-game marketplace or any other."
At the heart of the accusations is the question of grading. In the 1980s, ratings companies began offering numerical scores for coins at auction. In theory, that meant bidders knew exactly what they were getting without having to examine each lot personally.
Ratings accelerated the development of online auctions, with the practice spreading to sports cards, comic books and, more recently, game cartridges and videotapes. After grading, items are inserted into a hard plastic case to prevent wear. Just like a photo-match, a high grade reassures potential bidders that the object is, indeed, something special.
Then came the Super Mario Bros. game cartridge auctions.
Super Mario is a Nintendo game introduced in the mid-1980s that became a global phenomenon and, this month, a new Hollywood movie. In 2017, an unrated copy of the original game brought in $ 30,000 on eBay, prompting shock and disbelief. Two years later, a cartridge graded 9.4 sold for $ 100,000 to a group that included Jim Halperin, a founder of Heritage. The purchase was used by Heritage to promote its new auction of graded games.
In the summer of 2021, Heritage auctioned a Super Mario cartridge for $ 1.56 million, a tenfold increase in two years and the first game to be sold at auction for more than $ 1 million. It had a grade of 9.8 and was rated A++. The sale made news. In the same auction, a Super Mario was graded at 8.5 and rated A+. It sold for only $ 31,000.
Valarie Spiegel, who oversees video games at Heritage, explained the $ 1.5 million difference: "9.8 is a trophy-level grade," whereas "8.5 is not." Keep in mind this is not about the game itself but, in essence, the tightness of the plastic seal.
Grading, Mr. Jobst points out, is "very subjective by nature." When dealers and collectors get a grade that they think is too low, they simply crack open the plastic case and send the item back to the grading company or a competitor. This is known as "the crack-out game."
Forbes magazine accused Mr. Halperin of doing this with coins in 2004, creating a sort of grade inflation that pushed up prices for unwary bidders. In a lengthy rebuttal that is still on the Heritage website, Mr. Halperin said he publicly encouraged crack-outs by anyone who got a grade they thought too low.
"We sell an item as if it were our own," Mr. Ivy said. "Our question always is, How can we maximize this? The more we get for our consignors, the more money we make."
The Nostalgia Vault
The thrill of a collection is that it is real -- you can take it off the shelf. This is also, of course, the problem with collecting. Collections can easily overwhelm a house, a life.
Several online auction companies have recently announced programs to take care of collections for their owners. Collecting, which gained so much momentum as a response to the virtual, is moving away from its physical reality.
A program being tested at eBay uses a vault in Delaware to store sports cards. Collectors cannot visit their treasures, but eBay will take a photograph of the card and send it to the owner, kind of like seeing your child at summer camp. Beckett, a sports collectible company, has opened a 100,000-square-foot vault in Plano, Texas.
Mr. Carlson, the videocassette expert, is not so sure he would want to use a vault. He likes seeing his tapes too much. In any case, his collection is not growing much these days. He's wrapped up in his job at Heritage. And then there's the problem of money, or lack of it.
"Some of the tapes I like go beyond my budget," he said.

Auctioneer Helped Create Fake Artworks Shown As Basquiats in Orlando: [National Desk]

Full text: The man has agreed to plead guilty to a charge of lying to federal agents who say he helped to create the works displayed and later seized at the Orlando Museum of Art.
A Los Angeles auctioneer has agreed to plead guilty to making false statements to federal investigators and has admitted to helping create fake artworks that were displayed last year at the Orlando Museum of Art as previously unknown works of the celebrated artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.
The United States attorney's office for the Central District of California filed court papers on Tuesday announcing the plea by Michael Barzman, nine months after the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the museum and seized 25 paintings that had been hanging in its Basquiat exhibit, "Heroes & Monsters."
In court documents, prosecutors said Mr. Barzman, 45, of North Hollywood, had admitted to helping create between 20 and 30 fake artworks and then marketing them for sale as if they were authentic Basquiats.
Prosecutors said Mr. Barzman had worked closely with another man, identified only by the initials, J.F., who took the lead in creating the works. The associate spent as little as five minutes and no more than 30 minutes in creating each piece, according to the plea agreement.
The pair then placed the works outside to weather them so they would look as though they had been created decades ago, according to court records. Mr. Barzman sold the works and gave half the profits to his associate, prosecutors said.
Court documents also say that Mr. Barzman created false provenance for the fraudulent paintings, including a bogus story that they had been found in a storage unit, and then also created false documents to bolster that narrative.
He told investigators that he had sold the works to several buyers. They eventually ended up on view at the Orlando museum where, prosecutors wrote in court papers, in an exhibit purported to feature 25 paintings by Basquiat, "most of the featured works had, in fact, been created by defendant and J.F."
Mr. Barzman's initial accounts to investigators told a far different story, according to the court records. He said during several interviews with investigators that he had no role in making the paintings, even when confronted with a cardboard canvas that had been seized from the museum. On the back of the artwork was a shipping label with Mr. Barzman's name and former address, according to court records, but Mr. Barzman claimed he had never seen the work before.
Finally, in October 2022 Mr. Barzman admitted to agents that he "lied about the entire thing." He faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison.
Mr. Barzman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said the investigation was ongoing.
For the Orlando museum, which did not comment on Tuesday's announcement, the exhibition went from being a showcase of rarely seen Basquiats to an embarrassment.
Aaron De Groft, a former director and chief executive of the Orlando museum, had mounted the "Heroes & Monsters" exhibition and defended the works even after their authenticity was questioned. But he was removed from his post shortly after the raid on June 24. The F.B.I. showed up just days before the planned June 30 closing of the exhibit, after which the works were scheduled to be exhibited in Italy.
Mr. De Groft, who has not been implicated in any wrongdoing, did not respond to a request for comment. Previously, he told The New York Times that he had "absolutely no doubt" the works he put on display were Basquiats. "My reputation is at stake," he said.
Basquiats have become hugely valuable in the decades since the artist's death. One 1982 painting sold for $ 110.5 million at Sotheby's in 2017. Appraisals found that the works shown in Orlando would be worth tens of millions of dollars if they were authentic. (The Basquiat estate's authentication committee disbanded in 2012, at a time when many artists' estates had stopped trying to authenticate works because of the costly litigation that could ensue when their decisions were challenged.)
Soon after the "Heroes & Monsters" exhibition opened in February 2022 at the Orlando museum, a report in The New York Times raised doubts about whether the works were in fact by Basquiat. The article noted that one of the artworks being shown was painted on the back of a cardboard shipping box bearing an imprinted instruction to "Align top of FedEx Shipping Label here." A designer who worked for Federal Express said the typeface on the cardboard had not been used until 1994 -- six years after Basquiat's death.
Last May, when it has became clear that the F.B.I.'s Art Crime Team was investigating the authenticity of the paintings, their owners insisted they were authentic Basquiats, created in 1982 and sold for $ 5,000 to a now-deceased television screenwriter, Thad Mumford, whom they said had put them into a storage unit and forgotten about them.
Mr. Barzman, who for years ran an auction business that bought and resold the contents of unpaid storage units, said he had discovered the paintings among the contents of Mr. Mumford's storage unit, according to the plea agreement. But later he acknowledged to investigators that he had "used the acquisition of Mumford's stored items to create a false provenance for the fraudulent paintings," court documents said.
For his part, Mr. Mumford denied ever purchasing any Basquiats in a 2014 interview he did with Elizabeth Rivas, a special agent for the F.B.I. who for years led its Los Angeles-based art crime unit. The interview was referenced in an affidavit she filed last year as part of the effort to secure a search warrant for the museum.
The owners who brought the artworks to the Orlando museum for the exhibit have said in earlier interviews that they bought the paintings from either Mr. Barzman or from individuals who had purchased them on eBay from Mr. Barzman. Leo Mangan, one of the owners, said he and several others had spent about $ 15,000 for a total of 25 paintings, and then sold an interest in six of them to Los Angeles trial attorney Pierce O'Donnell, who worked closely with them to establish and market them as genuine Basquiats.
Mr. Barzman told agents that the buyers repeatedly contacted him over the years, asking him to sign paperwork saying that the works did, in fact, come from the Mumford storage unit, according to court documents. He admitted to eventually having signed a notarized document stating that the works had come from the unit after being offered between $ 10,000 or $ 15,000 to do so, according to the court documents, but said he never got paid.
Later, according to court documents, he said he acknowledged to one of the owners in either 2017 or 2018 that he could not actually prove that the paintings had come from the Mumford storage unit. He said the owner "reacted with anger."
On Tuesday, both Mr. Mangan and Mr. O'Donnell insisted they still believe the paintings are authentic Basquiats.
"I know Mr. Barzman, he's a proven unreliable person," Mr. O'Donnell said. He declined to elaborate, but promised further evidence would emerge.
"This is not the final chapter of the Mumford-Basquiat story," he said. Kirsten Noyes contributed research. The Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the Orlando Museum of Art in June and seized 25 paintings. (PHOTOGRAPH BY WILLIE J.

Full text: With vintage fashion in high demand, the hunt for archival designer wedding dresses is becoming serious business.
One of the most intimate questions you can ask eBay power users is to show you their negotiations -- the private DMs they exchange with sellers bargaining over the price of an item. But Alexis Novak humored me.
The item was a spring 2018 dress from the French luxury brand Céline, then under the creative direction of Phoebe Philo, a designer whose cult following is almost unparalleled in modern fashion. The gown, with long sleeves and a turtleneck and glazed in white sequins, was listed at $ 8,000. Ms. Novak offered $ 6,000. The seller politely declined.
Ms. Novak, 32, didn't push back. She knew her limits. As the founder of Tab Vintage in Los Angeles, she is among the generation of archival fashion collectors helping to change the way celebrities dress. Which means she is experienced in sourcing pieces from auctions, estate sales, resale websites and other dealers -- pieces like the Thierry Mugler dresses worn last year by Kourtney Kardashian Barker to the Oscars, and Dua Lipa to her Ibiza birthday party.
But the Céline dress was different. Ms. Novak didn't intend to add it to her archive for someone else to wear on a red carpet. She collects Ms. Philo's work, and from the moment she had seen the white gown in runway photos in late 2017, she had thought: "That is my dream wedding dress. That is the chicest, coolest dress I've ever seen."
Five years later -- and now engaged to James Valentine, the guitarist for Maroon 5 -- that eBay listing was only the second time Ms. Novak had come across the dress on the resale market. Still, she knew her price, and she walked away.
"But I thought about it every day," she said. "Should I, should I, should I?"
Then, after two months of silence, the eBay seller unexpectedly agreed to Ms. Novak's price. She bought the dress that day.
The truth was that Ms. Novak had long found weddings "kind of cheugy," she said. But since founding Tab in 2019, Ms. Novak, a former comedy writer, had increasingly fielded requests from clients and friends to help them hunt down archival bridal wear -- pieces with "character," she said. "Wearing vintage on your wedding day, you're not just plucking it off a runway or a rack and wearing what someone told you to wear. You're infusing your own personality. It's an extension of you."
She knew of one brick-and-mortar boutique with this kind of inventory (Happy Isles in Los Angeles) but none with a strong online store. "I felt like, from a business standpoint, I was leaving money on the table," she said.
So on Monday, she introduced a collection of about 85 bridal and wedding guest pieces on the Tab Vintage website, furthering a push into the market that began earlier this year.
In January, she was a co-host in Los Angeles of a three-day bridal and evening-wear event with Re-See, a resale company in Paris. All 72 shopping appointments were reserved weeks in advance. "It was madness," Ms. Novak said. A tearful altercation between two brides who wanted the same ruched strapless Loris Azzaro dress reminded Ms. Novak of a sign she once saw outside Amarcord Vintage Fashion in New York: "Nothing haunts you like the vintage you didn't buy."
Then in February, she teamed up with the online luxury retailer Moda Operandi on a selection of wedding dresses, suits and separates, including a 2004 Balenciaga "puffball" gown (reissued from an original 1951 design) and a 2006 Alexander McQueen silk dress with a gold chain bodice. Both sold for around $ 20,000.
That sale "didn't feel so bridal with a capital B," said Jamie Lenore McKillop, a brand consultant who bought a Martin Margiela couture dress from 2006, made from upcycled knits and silk. It was important to Ms. McKillop, 30, who lives in Los Angeles and is getting married in Sea Ranch, Calif., next summer, to find something singular.
"I'm not the girl who is embarrassed if she goes to a party and she sees someone else wearing the same thing," she said. "But with social media, certain weddings and dresses will go viral. And then it really becomes her dress -- or people associate it with someone else -- versus fully your own."
She's still looking for her actual wedding dress, however; the Margiela is for her rehearsal dinner. Because that's the thing about many modern weddings: They aren't just weddings. They are weekends full of welcome parties, after-parties, bridal-brunches-on-the-beach and aprés-ski-farewell lunches.
Chloe Green-Vamos's nuptial wardrobe includes a 1970s ivory Yves Saint Laurent suit ("very Bianca Jagger," she said), which she found in Paris, where the wedding will be held next spring. At the Tab Vintage and Re-See event in January, she bought two Balenciaga minidresses, circa 2000s -- one in textured brocade for the wedding brunch and the other in satin ("kind of Mia Farrow, Sharon Tate, '60s vibe") for the after-party.
She also acquired from Ms. Novak a silk cream column gown from Christian Dior's fall 1999 collection, designed by John Galliano, for her rehearsal dinner. And she is "95 percent sure" that her ceremony dress, currently on hold with Tab, will be a peachy-pink chiffon couture gown, fastened with a velvet black bow and camellia, that Claudia Schiffer wore the first time she walked the runway for Chanel in 1989. It is valued at more than $ 20,000.
Ms. Green-Vamos, 32, who is based in Los Angeles and works in strategy at Estee Lauder, likened her shopping experience to a "fashion Odyssey," in pursuit of pieces she felt would reflect her personality and story. (She studied in Paris and once worked as a buyer for Chanel, for example.) "I wanted that timeless elegance that these designers have been able to retain," she said. "This ability to stay modern, despite everything around us changing."
Ms. Novak herself also wore multiple looks to celebrate her wedding to Mr. Valentine on, yes, Valentine's Day. After the Céline gown, which had been tailored for a tight fit -- its turtleneck was temporarily detached for the occasion -- she changed into a more comfortable red jersey one-shoulder Halston dress from the 1970s. (In searching for her perfect slinky Halston, Ms. Novak acquired at least six; some have made their way into Tab's collection and onto the bodies of celebrities like Madelyn Cline at a Vanity Fair party.) Her veil was an upcycled pink embroidered Dries Van Noten cardigan, found on Vestiaire Collective.
There was also the elopement dress she wore on Feb. 5, when she legally married Mr. Valentine at their home in Los Angeles. The cream gown dated to the 1920s. She had her tailor turn its long sheer sleeves into a halter neckline to make it look "undone but still classic," she said.
Like some of the best vintage pieces, it had no designer label.

Full text: On a blustery February evening in Midtown Manhattan, opposite an unmarked side entrance to the Ed Sullivan Theater, a crowd of more than 60 people stood crushed against a row of steel barricades. They all knew that at any moment, Harrison Ford would arrive for an appearance on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert." They elbowed and cursed one another, jockeying for position, each clutching a sheaf of photographs for Mr. Ford to sign.
They weren't fans -- not most of them, anyway. They were "graphers," who make a living by hounding celebrities for autographs and selling them to the highest bidder. For many of them, graphing is a full-time job. Some have been at it for decades. They can flip a single signature for anywhere from $ 25 to more than $ 1,000, depending on a star's cachet and how frequently they sign. A Harrison Ford autograph, for example, retails for about $ 750.
At 5:30 on the dot, a black Escalade pulled to a stop in front of the theater. The rear door swung open, and the pack of graphers across the street broke into a frenzy. "Harrison!" they hollered. "Harrison, please!"
Slumped near a dumpster by the stage door, a disheveled man with a mane of gray hair and a wild beard let out a grunt. He clambered to his feet, reached into a grocery bag and pulled out an overstuffed FedEx mailer, inscribed in large, looping cursive with a note. "Thank you, Harrison," it read. "Love, Radio Man." He staggered past the theater's security team and approached the Escalade.
"Harrison!" the man called as Mr. Ford climbed out of the back seat. "How are ya?"
Mr. Ford grinned. "Radio," he said warmly. They shook hands. Fifty feet away, the graphers behind the barricades bellowed in a desperate chorus.
"Listen, I've got some photos for you," the man said, handing Mr. Ford the package.
"Sure, sure," Mr. Ford said, accepting it. They made small talk. Mr. Ford asked after the man's health, and the man asked after Helen Mirren, Mr. Ford's co-star on the "Yellowstone" spinoff "1923."
"Good to see you, Radio," Mr. Ford said. He slipped into the theater without acknowledging the graphers screaming his name. They would have to wait until he had finished his interview.

There are at least 150 professional graphers in New York City, according to Justin Steffman, the founder of the autograph authentication company AutographCOA. And right now, they are working at full tilt. All winter long, celebrities have been flocking to New York to campaign for projects up for various film and television awards, culminating in the Oscars. For graphers, collecting signatures during awards season is like fishing at a trout farm.
The rest of the year is by no means slow. Stars are always cycling in and out of Broadway theaters, concert venues, luxe hotels, film shoots and, most reliably, morning shows like "The View" and late-night shows like Mr. Colbert's. Their constant presence has made New York the graphing capital of the United States, topping even Los Angeles, whose sprawl, closed sets and tight security make life more challenging for graphers.
"It's got to be a billion-dollar industry," Mr. Steffman said. "It's gotten bigger and bigger and bigger."
There are at least 500 full-time graphers around the world, Mr. Steffman said, and thousands more who graph on a regular basis.
But none of them do it quite like Radio Man.
Radio Man -- legally known as Craig Castaldo, though no one ever calls him that -- has been graphing in New York since the early 1990s. Over the years, he has managed to charm a small army of celebrities into accepting his hefty packages of photographs, which they sign and return to him. Where most graphers would be lucky to get more than one signature from a star at a time, Radio Man regularly nabs dozens, sometimes hundreds. He considers the A-listers who sign for him his personal friends.
After his exchange with Mr. Ford, Radio Man made his way to the Park Hyatt to pick up a package that Sarah Michelle Gellar had left for him at reception. It was adorned with a heart in black Sharpie, along with a handwritten note: "Only for you, Radio." Inside were 43 signed photographs of Ms. Gellar.
"It's amazing how they take to me, these actors," Radio Man said. "A bum! I don't understand it."
Radio Man, 72, lives just above the poverty line, in a basement apartment in Yonkers he rents for $ 900 a month. He commutes into the city each morning on his bicycle, a 13-mile journey that takes him about two hours. He said he survives exclusively on food he gathers from free pantries and movie sets.
Though he could make a small fortune selling his autographs directly to collectors, his grasp of the necessary tools -- photo databases, printers, the internet -- is tenuous at best. Instead, like most graphers, he peddles his merchandise to a dealer, who in turn hawks it at a significant markup on eBay and other, more obscure autograph marketplaces.
Leaning against a wall outside the Park Hyatt, Radio Man pulled out his phone and made a call. A few minutes later, a silver sedan pulled up to the hotel. A tall, middle-aged man with close-cropped hair and a manicured beard stepped out of the car and into the frigid night. Radio Man handed him the package of signed photographs from Ms. Gellar, and the man accepted them without a word. He hurried back to the warmth of his car, leaving Radio Man alone next to his bicycle.
"Hey," Radio Man called out to him. "You got six bucks so I could get a tea or something?"
"I don't have any cash on me," the man said. He ducked into the car and drove away.
The man, Radio Man's de facto handler, supplies him with his FedEx mailers of photographs. Once Radio Man gets them signed, the handler sends them to a dealer based in Florida, who is rumored among graphers to be a millionaire. All told, the autographs Radio Man received from Ms. Gellar are worth approximately $ 6,000. He was paid about $ 300 for them.
"Let them make all the money they want," Radio Man said. "I don't care. As long as I get to see my friends."
By "friends," he meant the celebrities who have taken an unlikely shine to him since he stumbled into their world more than 30 years ago.
As Radio Man tells it, he made his first famous friend when he was homeless. One winter day in 1990, he was walking through Central Park when he encountered a man dressed in rags, whom he took for "a bum like me," he said. He offered the man a beer. "Do you know who I am?" the man asked.
It was Robin Williams. He was shooting "The Fisher King," Terry Gilliam's 1991 film in which Mr. Williams plays a vagabond searching for the Holy Grail.
"You're doing this all wrong," Radio Man told him. "You're not acting the way a bum should be."
He introduced the actor to life on the street, showing him "where to go and what to do." Mr. Williams patterned his performance in "The Fisher King," which earned him an Oscar nomination, after Radio Man. Or so Radio Man claims.
In exchange for his guidance, the movie's producers gave Radio Man $ 200 and a case of beer. They also cast him as an extra. From then on, he made a habit of hanging around film sets in New York, where he helped himself to food from craft-services stations and scored low-paying parts as a background actor. Graphing was an easy way to make money.
"I've been getting movies ever since," Radio Man said. "Here and there, playing my role: bum, homeless guy, guy on a bicycle with a radio."
But that's just one version of the story Radio Man tells about his origins.
Another version involves running a newspaper stand in the 1970s and being cast as an extra in "The In-Laws," starring Peter Falk and Alan Arkin. Another involves sharing a beer with Bruce Willis on the set of "The Bonfire of the Vanities." Yet another involves showing up to shoots with a boombox around his neck and playing it at full volume until someone paid him to leave, a racket that supposedly earned him his nickname. ("A cop was there and he said to me: 'Hey, radio guy! Hey, radio person! Hey, radio man! Can you turn that down, please?' And that's how I became Radio Man.")
Whatever he may claim about his past, this much is true: Radio Man is a fixture on film sets in New York. He has appeared as an extra in dozens of movies, including "Ransom," "Zoolander," "The Departed" and "The Irishman." He has a preternatural knowledge of actors' whereabouts and shooting schedules. And he has forged something like a friendship with some of the biggest names in Hollywood.
On a January night in Chinatown, Radio Man sauntered around the set of "Wolves," a forthcoming movie starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, as if he were its executive producer. He weaved through packs of stagehands, chatting amiably with anyone who crossed his path. During a break in shooting, he shuffled over to Mr. Clooney, who was sitting in a director's chair. "Clooney!" he shouted, followed by an expletive-laden insult.
"There it is," Mr. Clooney said.
"You know where you're going tomorrow?"
"I don't know where I'm going tomorrow," Mr. Clooney said.
"Under the Manhattan Bridge."
"See, this is what I'm talking about," Mr. Clooney said, as the production crew standing around him laughed. "You don't need a call sheet. Radio Man is the call sheet."
Mr. Clooney first met Radio Man in 1996, on the set of "One Fine Day" in Manhattan. The actor has "never not seen him" during a trip to New York since, he said.
"Radio's everywhere," Mr. Clooney said. "Every hotel you show up at, Radio will be standing out in front of it going, 'De Niro's over at this, and Cate Blanchett's over here staying at the Carlyle.' He's got all the intel."
Radio Man endeared himself to Mr. Clooney, the actor said, after rescuing his wife, Amal Clooney, from a throng of paparazzi that had swarmed her on Fifth Avenue. Radio Man blocked them with his bicycle, hailed a cab and steered Ms. Clooney inside, securing her escape.
"He's a great guy," Mr. Clooney said. "He's a lovable mess, which we all are."
About six years ago, Mr. Clooney got together with a few other actors and flew Radio Man out to L.A. They sent him to the Oscars. He wore a tuxedo. He walked the red carpet. He sat in the audience. He brought a date.
A few nights after bumping into Radio Man in Chinatown, Mr. Clooney poked his head out of a white trailer parked on East Broadway and peered down the street. "Radio!" he yelled.
Radio Man ambled over. Mr. Clooney strode toward him holding a large bag, trailed by a pack of photographers.
"Here you go, Radio," he said, dropping the bag on the sidewalk with a thunk. "This thing weighs a ton, by the way."
Radio Man reached inside and pulled out two bulging FedEx mailers. They contained 185 signed photographs of Mr. Clooney, worth approximately $ 18,000.
Mr. Clooney said that Radio Man is the only grapher he will take a package from. But he signs for all of them.
"Every one of these guys who come over for autographs, it's a business for them," he said. "You try to help them out when you can."
There is at least one other grapher in New York capable of exchanging packages with celebrities: Giovanni Arnold, 38, who has been graphing in the city since 1999. He calls himself "Black Radio Man."
"There isn't really an elite group of graphers who are getting packages," Mr. Steffman said. "There's Gio, and there's Radio Man."
On a Saturday afternoon in January, Mr. Arnold sat in a dark bar in the East Village indexing several large bags of autographed memorabilia he had just received from Daniel Radcliffe, who was starring in a production of "Merrily We Roll Along" at the New York Theater Workshop a few blocks away.
He laid out his haul on a grimy, beer-stained table, examining each item -- cheaply printed photos, plastic Harry Potter eyeglasses, Gryffindor neckties -- for Mr. Radcliffe's signature. He counted 95 autographs in all, whose total value he pegged at $ 10,000. "I'm hype right now," he said. "He really blessed me."
Mr. Arnold celebrated with a Guinness. He took a sip from his pint glass and shook his head, pondering a question that has long puzzled him: Why would anyone pay for an autograph?
"My job baffles me," he said. "Personally, I wouldn't buy an autograph. It would be of more sentimental value if I got the autograph myself, but if someone else got it, it's just weird."
Mr. Arnold has taken a different approach to the business of graphing than most of his peers. He sells his own merchandise on eBay, as well as directly to private collectors, which has allowed him to accrue a level of wealth few graphers seem to enjoy.
He documents his day-to-day life hunting for autographs on Instagram under the handle @gtvreality, where you might find him giving Lady Gaga a ride on his bicycle, holding hands with Ben Affleck or shouting his catchphrase -- "Stay Black!" -- at Bob Dylan. He hopes to turn GTV Reality into a full-fledged brand and to monetize his content, though at 5,000 followers, he hasn't quite figured out how to do so.
"I'm trying to move in a different direction," he said. "Everyone and their mama's an autograph-getter now."
Ultimately, Mr. Arnold wants to find a way out of the memorabilia industry. He doesn't derive the same kind of joy that Radio Man does from chasing down celebrities, and he isn't willing to dedicate his life to it.
"I'm good at what I do," Mr. Arnold said. "But he's another level."
Back on the set of "Wolves," Radio Man cruised the streets of Chinatown looking for the director, Jon Watts. He was hoping there might be a scene he could sneak into. But the cameras were already rolling, and Mr. Watts was occupied.
Radio Man returned to his usual post outside Mr. Clooney's trailer. It was closing in on midnight. He was standing near his bicycle and sipping a hot tea, killing time until the next break in filming, when he was approached by someone he didn't recognize.
"Radio," the man said. He held up an 8-by-10-inch photograph, taped to a sheet of hardboard, of Radio Man. "Do you mind signing real quick?"
"What do you want me to say?" Radio Man asked. "Just, Radio Man?"
"Yeah," the man said. "Radio Man."
Radio Man signed the photograph in big, sloppy cursive. The man thanked him and walked away. It was hard to say if he was a grapher or just a fan.

There are at least 150 professional graphers in New York City, according to Justin Steffman, founder of the autograph authentication company AutographCOA. And right now, they are working at full tilt. All winter long, celebrities have been flocking to New York to campaign for projects up for various film and television awards, culminating in the Oscars. For graphers, collecting signatures during awards season is like fishing at a trout farm.
The rest of the year is by no means slow. Stars are always cycling in and out of Broadway theaters, concert venues, luxe hotels, film shoots and, most reliably, morning shows like “The View” and late-night shows like Colbert’s. Their constant presence has made New York the graphing capital of the United States, topping even Los Angeles, whose sprawl, closed sets and tight security make life more challenging for graphers.
“It’s got to be a billion-dollar industry,” Steffman said. “It’s gotten bigger and bigger and bigger.”
There are at least 500 full-time graphers around the world, Steffman said, and thousands more who graph on a regular basis.
But none of them do it quite like Radio Man.
Radio Man — legally known as Craig Castaldo, though no one ever calls him that — has been graphing in New York since the early 1990s. Over the years, he has managed to charm a small army of celebrities into accepting his hefty packages of photographs, which they sign and return to him. Where most graphers would be lucky to get more than one signature from a star at a time, Radio Man regularly nabs dozens, sometimes hundreds. He considers the A-listers who sign for him his personal friends.
After his exchange with Ford, Radio Man made his way to the Park Hyatt to pick up a package that Sarah Michelle Gellar had left for him at reception. It was adorned with a heart in black Sharpie, along with a handwritten note: “Only for you, Radio.” Inside were 43 signed photographs of Gellar.
“It’s amazing how they take to me, these actors,” Radio Man said. “A bum! I don’t understand it.”
Radio Man, 72, lives just above the poverty line, in a basement apartment in Yonkers he rents for $900 a month. He commutes into the city each morning on his bicycle, a 13-mile journey that takes him about two hours. He said he survives exclusively on food he gathers from free pantries and movie sets.
Though he could make a small fortune selling his autographs directly to collectors, his grasp of the necessary tools — photo databases, printers, the internet — is tenuous at best. Instead, like most graphers, he peddles his merchandise to a dealer, who in turn hawks it at a significant markup on eBay and other, more obscure autograph marketplaces.
Leaning against a wall outside the Park Hyatt, Radio Man pulled out his phone and made a call. A few minutes later, a silver sedan pulled up to the hotel. A tall, middle-aged man with close-cropped hair and a manicured beard stepped out of the car and into the frigid night. Radio Man handed him the package of signed photographs from Gellar, and the man accepted them without a word. He hurried back to the warmth of his car, leaving Radio Man alone next to his bicycle.
“Hey,” Radio Man called out to him. “You got six bucks so I could get a tea or something?”
“I don’t have any cash on me,” the man said. He ducked into the car and drove away.
The man, Radio Man’s de facto handler, supplies him with his FedEx mailers of photographs. Once Radio Man gets them signed, the handler sends them to a dealer based in Florida, who is rumored among graphers to be a millionaire. All told, the autographs Radio Man received from Gellar are worth approximately $6,000. He was paid about $300 for them.
“Let them make all the money they want,” Radio Man said. “I don’t care. As long as I get to see my friends.”
By “friends,” he meant the celebrities who have taken an unlikely shine to him since he stumbled into their world more than 30 years ago.
As Radio Man tells it, he made his first famous friend when he was homeless. One winter day in 1990, he was walking through Central Park when he encountered a man dressed in rags, whom he took for “a bum like me,” he said. He offered the man a beer. “Do you know who I am?” the man asked.
It was Robin Williams. He was shooting “The Fisher King,” Terry Gilliam’s 1991 film in which Williams plays a vagabond searching for the Holy Grail.
“You’re doing this all wrong,” Radio Man told him. “You’re not acting the way a bum should be.”
He introduced the actor to life on the street, showing him “where to go and what to do.” Williams patterned his performance in “The Fisher King,” which earned him an Oscar nomination, after Radio Man. Or so Radio Man claims.
In exchange for his guidance, the movie’s producers gave Radio Man $200 and a case of beer. They also cast him as an extra. From then on, he made a habit of hanging around film sets in New York, where he helped himself to food from craft-services stations and scored low-paying parts as a background actor. Graphing was an easy way to make money.
“I’ve been getting movies ever since,” Radio Man said. “Here and there, playing my role: bum, homeless guy, guy on a bicycle with a radio.”
But that’s just one version of the story Radio Man tells about his origins.
Another version involves running a newspaper stand in the 1970s and being cast as an extra in “The In-Laws,” starring Peter Falk and Alan Arkin. Another involves sharing a beer with Bruce Willis on the set of “The Bonfire of the Vanities.” Yet another involves showing up to shoots with a boombox around his neck and playing it at full volume until someone paid him to leave, a racket that supposedly earned him his nickname. (“A cop was there and he said to me: ‘Hey, radio guy! Hey, radio person! Hey, radio man! Can you turn that down, please?’ And that’s how I became Radio Man.”)
Radio Man is a fixture on film sets in New York. He has appeared as an extra in dozens of movies, including “Ransom,” “Zoolander,” “The Departed” and “The Irishman.” He has a preternatural knowledge of actors’ whereabouts and shooting schedules. And he has forged something like a friendship with some of the biggest names in Hollywood.
On a January night in Chinatown, Radio Man sauntered around the set of “Wolves,” a forthcoming movie starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, as if he were its executive producer. He weaved through packs of stagehands, chatting amiably with anyone who crossed his path. During a break in shooting, he shuffled over to Clooney, who was sitting in a director’s chair. “Clooney!” he shouted, followed by an expletive-laden insult.
“There it is,” Clooney said.
“You know where you’re going tomorrow?”
“I don’t know where I’m going tomorrow,” Clooney said.
“Under the Manhattan Bridge.”
“See, this is what I’m talking about,” Clooney said, as the production crew standing around him laughed. “You don’t need a call sheet. Radio Man is the call sheet.”
Clooney first met Radio Man in 1996, on the set of “One Fine Day” in Manhattan. The actor has “never not seen him” during a trip to New York since, he said.
“Radio’s everywhere,” Clooney said. “Every hotel you show up at, Radio will be standing out in front of it going, ‘De Niro’s over at this, and Cate Blanchett’s over here staying at the Carlyle.’ He’s got all the intel.”
Radio Man endeared himself to Clooney, the actor said, after rescuing his wife, Amal Clooney, from a throng of paparazzi that had swarmed her on Fifth Avenue. Radio Man blocked them with his bicycle, hailed a cab and steered Amal Clooney inside, securing her escape.
“He’s a great guy,” George Clooney said. “He’s a lovable mess, which we all are.”
About six years ago, Clooney got together with a few other actors and flew Radio Man out to LA. They sent him to the Oscars. He wore a tuxedo. He walked the red carpet. He sat in the audience. He brought a date.
A few nights after bumping into Radio Man in Chinatown, Clooney poked his head out of a white trailer parked on East Broadway and peered down the street. “Radio!” he yelled.
Radio Man ambled over. Clooney strode toward him holding a large bag, trailed by a pack of photographers.
“Here you go, Radio,” he said, dropping the bag on the sidewalk with a thunk. “This thing weighs a ton, by the way.”
Radio Man reached inside and pulled out two bulging FedEx mailers. They contained 185 signed photographs of Clooney, worth approximately $18,000.
Clooney said that Radio Man is the only grapher he will take a package from. But he signs for all of them.
“Every one of these guys who come over for autographs, it’s a business for them,” he said. “You try to help them out when you can.”
There is at least one other grapher in New York capable of exchanging packages with celebrities: Giovanni Arnold, 38, who has been graphing in the city since 1999. He calls himself “Black Radio Man.”
“There isn’t really an elite group of graphers who are getting packages,” Steffman said. “There’s Gio, and there’s Radio Man.”
On a Saturday afternoon in January, Arnold sat in a dark bar in the East Village indexing several large bags of autographed memorabilia he had just received from Daniel Radcliffe, who was starring in a production of “Merrily We Roll Along” at the New York Theater Workshop a few blocks away.
He laid out his haul on a grimy, beer-stained table, examining each item — cheaply printed photos, plastic Harry Potter eyeglasses, Gryffindor neckties — for Radcliffe’s signature. He counted 95 autographs in all, whose total value he pegged at $10,000. “I’m hype right now,” he said. “He really blessed me.”
Arnold celebrated with a Guinness. He took a sip from his pint glass and shook his head, pondering a question that has long puzzled him: Why would anyone pay for an autograph?
“My job baffles me,” he said. “Personally, I wouldn’t buy an autograph. It would be of more sentimental value if I got the autograph myself, but if someone else got it, it’s just weird.”
Arnold has taken a different approach to the business of graphing than most of his peers. He sells his own merchandise on eBay, as well as directly to private collectors, which has allowed him to accrue a level of wealth few graphers seem to enjoy.
He documents his day-to-day life hunting for autographs on Instagram under the handle @gtvreality, where you might find him giving Lady Gaga a ride on his bicycle, holding hands with Ben Affleck or shouting his catchphrase — “Stay Black!” — at Bob Dylan. He hopes to turn GTV Reality into a full-fledged brand and to monetize his content, though at 5,000 followers, he hasn’t quite figured out how to do so.
“I’m trying to move in a different direction,” he said. “Everyone and their mama’s an autograph-getter now.”
Ultimately, Arnold wants to find a way out of the memorabilia industry. He doesn’t derive the same kind of joy that Radio Man does from chasing down celebrities, and he isn’t willing to dedicate his life to it.
“I’m good at what I do,” Arnold said. “But he’s another level.”
Back on the set of “Wolves,” Radio Man cruised the streets of Chinatown looking for the director, Jon Watts. He was hoping there might be a scene he could sneak into. But the cameras were already rolling, and Watts was occupied.
Radio Man returned to his usual post outside Clooney’s trailer. It was closing in on midnight. He was standing near his bicycle and sipping a hot tea, killing time until the next break in filming, when he was approached by someone he didn’t recognize.
“Radio,” the man said. He held up an 8-by-10-inch photograph, taped to a sheet of hardboard, of Radio Man. “Do you mind signing real quick?”
“What do you want me to say?” Radio Man asked. “Just, Radio Man?”
“Yeah,” the man said. “Radio Man.”
Radio Man signed the photograph in big, sloppy cursive. The man thanked him and walked away. It was hard to say if he was a grapher or just a fan.

PAJARO, Calif. — It began as a trickle, seeping through a 74-year-old earthen levee in Northern California, dribs and drabs of the Pajaro River, swollen with rain yet again on Friday night. Then pools bubbled up on beyond the levee walls, spreading toward darkened fields of strawberries and lettuce. Four miles downstream, the farmworker community of Pajaro slept.
Within half an hour, according to Mark Strudley, the Pajaro Regional Flood Management Agency’s executive director, sandbag crews were swarming the scene in “full flood fight.” But in the latest example of how California’s vast and aging infrastructure is being tested by this year’s onslaught of extreme winter weather, the crews could not keep up.
As they backed away, the river burst with a mighty roar through the worn-down levee, flooding freeways and farms, submerging the entire town of Pajaro and forcing thousands of residents in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties to flee.
“I have to start from zero,” Antonio Arroyo, a 58-year-old farmworker, said Tuesday as he sat in an evacuation center at the Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds with about 300 displaced residents from the same community, known for harvesting strawberries. He had been sleeping in a Honda minivan when firefighters rescued him from the rising floodwaters in Pajaro; the donated red sneakers, bluejeans, sweater and plaid shirt he was wearing were “all I have,” he said.
As a fresh atmospheric river ravaged California on Tuesday, causing high winds and flooding from Southern California to the Oregon border, water experts warned that the recent storms could be just a prelude to an even more challenging spring.
Already, the landscape is beyond saturated after a winter that has set or approached records for precipitation. By Tuesday afternoon, heavy rain reached the Los Angeles Basin, where officials warned residents to avoid driving through flooded roadways and fire authorities said they rescued eight people and eight dogs from the San Gabriel River in Azusa late Monday.
In the Bay Area and Central Coast, strong winds downed power lines and tall trees. More than 350,000 utility customers were without power at one point Tuesday, most of them customers of Pacific Gas and Electric in hard-hit Northern California, according to Poweroutage.us, which tracks blackouts. Gusts of up to 74 mph were recorded at San Francisco International Airport, where operations were paused briefly after the FAA issued a ground stop.
Water from the Pajaro River breached a levee on Tuesday, forcing the closure of a portion of Highway 1 until the safety of bridges could be assessed.
More than 1,500 dams and some 14,000 miles of levees help control California’s waterways, according to federal statistics. And this year’s storms are capping the driest three years on record, noted Gary Lippner, deputy director of dam safety and flood management with the state’s Department of Water Resources.
“California,” he said, “has experienced true climate whiplash this year.”
Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow specializing in water at the Public Policy Institute of California, a research organization, said the cumulative effect of this winter’s back-to-back storms had left California in “uncharted territory,” particularly in the southern Sierra Nevada, where the water content of the snowpack was the largest recorded.
As the snowpack melts, he said, and dam managers are forced to release water from fast-filling reservoirs to make room for incoming rain, flood-prone communities could become overwhelmed.
“It is worth remembering that almost all of our flood management infrastructure is more than a half-century old and designed around the climate of the past,” Mount said Tuesday in an email.
“While we have had many discussions about adapting to droughts of the future — and are making progress — we are still in the most nascent stages of thinking about how to adapt to larger floods.”
Statewide, the winter storms have stressed the state’s infrastructure since January, particularly in low-lying, inland areas crisscrossed by rivers. Along the Cosumnes River near Sacramento, where more than a dozen levee breaches flooded roads and inundated homes during storms around New Year’s Day, communities are still recovering.
To the north of the state Capitol, the authorities who maintain the watershed that encompasses the Sacramento International Airport said that when one of their pumps exploded this year during a powerful storm system, they discovered that their equipment was so old that the manufacturer no longer carried the parts they needed to fix it.
”We managed to get it back online with a $600 part we found on eBay,” said Kevin L. King, the general manager of Reclamation District No. 1000, an agency formed to maintain levees and protect acreage from flooding. “We were within 12 to 24 hours of telling the airport to reroute flights because there would have been water flooding the runways.”
Strudley said that federal, state and local officials had talked since the 1960s about the need to shore up the water infrastructure around the Pajaro River, but the property values in the area were so low that they did not meet the threshold for repair under the cost-benefit formula that the federal government and the Army Corps of Engineers were using.
That approach, which systemically disadvantaged poorer communities, has begun to change, he said. A major project to upgrade and strengthen the local levees at an estimated cost of more than $500 million was underway when the storm hit, and the flood has prompted local officials to begin talks with the federal government about expediting its planned 2025 groundbreaking, Strudley said.
Even so, he added, the project is expected to take eight to 10 years.
In Watsonville, across the river from their community of Pajaro, displaced farmworkers said it was unclear how long they could hold out with both their homes and the fields they depend on for paychecks underwater. Some said they had been living in their cars for days, not knowing where to go.
The working-class agricultural region is tucked between the beaches of Santa Cruz that are popular with surfers, and the wealthy Monterey Peninsula known for its world-class Pebble Beach Golf Links. Often cloaked in fog near the coastline of the Pacific Ocean, workers in the Pajaro Valley pick strawberries and harvest lettuce and artichokes savored by the rest of the nation.
Marina Hernandez, 31, said she received a knock on the door just after midnight Saturday from a county worker saying her family had an hour to evacuate. She called her husband, who was working an overnight shift about 20 miles away at a garlic packing plant in Gilroy, and then quickly collected important documents, like birth certificates and Social Security cards.
But she said county officials did not tell her where to find shelter, so she and her family were living for a few days in their pickup truck. “All they said was: ‘Get out! Get out!’ But they didn’t tell us where to go. Nothing.”
Finally, after being sent away from the Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds because the evacuation center was over capacity, she found her way Tuesday afternoon to a small shelter set up in the gymnasium of a veterans hall in Watsonville.
Sitting on a cot with her 14-month-old daughter as her 5-year-old son lay playing with his phone on another cot, Hernandez said she was sad and frustrated and had no idea the condition of her home.
Weeks might pass, she said, before she and her family could go back. Until then, she said, “I’m not able to do anything.”

Full text: The cluttered, lively ethos of Apartment Life offers an antidote to the chilly perfectionism of Instagram -- and creative ideas that still feel relevant.
"Believe it or not, your next home could be in a dentist's office," a popular shelter magazine declared, referring to underused New York City commercial buildings that were being turned into apartments.
The year was 1979, and the magazine was Apartment Life, a monthly dedicated to young Americans who had moved out of their college dorms and were settling into urban studios and one-bedrooms instead of houses in the suburbs.
Founded in 1969, Apartment Life was a vivid time capsule of macramé, wicker, houseplants and furnishings whipped together from boards, pipes and scraps. It was stuffed with information about rent-control regulations, low-cost tropical getaways and how not to be intimidated by French cuisine. It brandished terrible puns in its headlines: "There's No Place Like Foam" (about sofa material) and "Fanfare for the Uncommon Pan" (about cookware). In 1981, it morphed into the more urbane Metropolitan Home.
Apartment Life's 800,000 readers typically lived on their own or with partners. They were determined to explore the worlds beyond colonial-style bedroom suites and meatloaf -- albeit on a budget. They postponed marriage and child-rearing to entertain their friends in shoe boxes that they could arrange to express their identities and values.
Today, we know this group as baby boomers on the road to affluence. But "it's a cycle of life that continues no matter in what era," said Amanda Dameron, the chief content officer of A360 Media (formerly American Media). Ms. Dameron is working to bring back the old Apartment Life, in its original guise, as a special-interest publication. She sees its cluttered, lively ethos as an antidote to the chilly perfectionism of Instagram and finds relevance in its message to young people today.
"You're coming into adulthood, and you want to figure out who you are," she said. "For the first time, you have your own space and agency over it. You don't have all the money in the world, but you have opportunities."
Ms. Dameron, 45, who managed to snap up almost a full set of back issues of Apartment Life on eBay -- 69 in all, for $ 510 -- is a fan girl. Several years ago, when she was hired to produce instructional videos about home design for the company Tastemade, she did a series based on D.I.Y. projects from the magazine, like building a rolling plant wall and weaving a colorful nylon hammock. Her staff of zoomers starred in the productions, wearing flip hairdos and turtlenecks and grooving to a bouncy synth-and-brass soundtrack.
"It was not overly earnest; it was meant to be fun and funny," she said. Just like its inspiration.
Apartment Life was the oddball child of the conservative Meredith Corporation, in Des Moines, Iowa, the publisher of the heartland handbook Better Homes & Gardens. Dorothy Kalins, the magazine's founding executive editor and later editor in chief, said Meredith had caught wind of an emerging market of well-educated readers who scorned Better Homes' emphasis on traditional design and housewifely values.
Apartment Life "kind of codified what I and my friends and our generation were about," she said. "We would jump off buildings rather than live in a Better Homes & Gardens house."
Ms. Kalins, 80, orchestrated the cheeky voice and visual antics that became Apartment Life's brand. When the magazine published its "Hassle-Free Holiday Issue," in 1976, for example, it gave the distinct impression that the holidays were to be endured as much as enjoyed. The D.I.Y. crafts included paint-it-yourself "anti-Depression glass" and a wreath made from neckties scrounged from the Salvation Army. The "Save Our Sanity" department included a chart of shipping rates (by truck, bus, train and plane) for gifts that readers might have dragged their feet in sending.
Having contributed to New York magazine under the tutelage of its founders, Clay Felker and Milton Glaser, she knew how to provide service journalism with a smile. A 1975 story called "Choosing Apartment Pets -- Which Adapt, Which Don't," put the answers succinctly in a grid. Among the adapters were dachshunds and iguanas. Forget about monkeys and koi.
A 1976 article insisted that "a planter is anything that won't dissolve" and illustrated that maxim with photos of greenery growing in rubber gloves and castoff shoes.
"There was so much energy, so much humor," Ms. Kalins said. "Nobody took themselves too seriously."
Underneath the lively spirit, however, was a mission to recalibrate the values and customs of postwar middle-class America. Apartment Life decreed that the kitchen was the new living room where readers could kick back, and that friends were the new family that they could choose. A first-person account of a home renovation called "My Wife the Carpenter" made no bones about a sea change in sex roles: "Like everyone else," the author wrote, "we were hell-bent on not doing the things our parents had."
Making the point that it was not a Ladies' Home Journal, the magazine mostly displayed couples on its covers. Some of the subjects were models. Some were what Ms. Kalins described as "real people." (Pointing to a man in a ribbed yellow pullover, she said, "That was my high school boyfriend.") Many (including her ex-boyfriend) had Tom Selleck-like mustaches.
The covers also featured people of color, gay couples and celebrities like Robin Williams and Richard Dreyfuss.
Three themes seemed to permeate the pages. It was OK to live alone as a single person. Small quarters did not demand small furniture; instead, rooms and objects should be multifunctional. And a lamp could be made from anything -- colanders, parasols, canning jars, wicker baskets, rolls of twine. Anything.
"That was the cri de coeur," Ms. Kalins said of the lamps.
Rayman Boozer, the founder of the New York interior design company Apartment 48, recalled enjoying Apartment Design as a teenager in Indiana because it was not about buying things. "At that time, there was no upcycling," he said. The magazine was unusual in encouraging readers to scavenge for tossed-out furniture and recover it themselves. Mr. Boozer took its advice to turn tomato cans into planters.
This was not what advertisers wanted to hear, but Ms. Kalins lured them by mixing luxury goods with handmade accessories and thrift-store finds. In a feature called "Hi-Lo," room vignettes were populated with similar objects itemized at different prices, so readers could get the look of, say, a Victorian boudoir for more than $ 4,000 (about $ 21,000 today) or less than $ 600 (about $ 3,150 today).
"We travel the country in ragged bunches, always with more shopping bags than hands," she wrote in "The Apartment Book," a 1979 collection of articles from the magazine, referring to the styling of the elaborate photo shoots.
Philip M. Tusa can vouch for those shopping bags. In the mid-1970s, he was a young interior designer living with his wife, Kathleen Ferguson-Tusa, in a studio apartment in Manhattan, when Apartment Life swooped in. The editors had so many props and so much Mediterranean food for a spread that the bags holding those things had to be left in the hallway, he recalled.
Mr. Tusa, who is now 72, had built a variety of furnishings to make the small home more comfortable for a couple. He remembered that the editors coined names for them: the "Wonder-Working Wall" (a plywood partition with storage); the "Alley Office" (a work nook set off by a smoked-plexiglass panel); the "Surprising Black Box" (a coffee table covered with textured-rubber floor tile that hid sliding wood shelves).
The article, "The Engineered Apartment," appeared in May 1976. It showed the Tusas and a friend chowing down on tabbouleh and grape leaves in the styled interior, and provided diagrams for making the furniture.
Another magazine subject, Andrea Brown, was less comfortable with Apartment Life's zhuzhing. Ms. Brown said she cannot remember how the editors came to transform the living room of her Brooklyn brownstone for a January 1974 article about creating the illusion of a wider space, but she was put off by the enormous yellow kite they hung over her fireplace mantel. Even more painful was the yellow, green and purple crocheted rug dropped on her floor. Ms. Brown, 83, who is an artist, said she is still galled that these interventions were billed as an improvement. "Cover the rug with your hand," she advised a reporter before sending photos of the spread.
By 1981, the scrappy party was over. Hippies were turning into yuppies with the emergence of the Reagan era. Meredith had bet correctly on a market of urban renters, but as the Times reported, "Now most of these same people want equity in their dwellings, so they have gone to condos, co-ops, townhouses and even homes in the suburbs, while remaining city oriented."
A hundred thousand insufficiently affluent readers were cut from the circulation list. "We have to get those nuts-and-boltsies out of the audience," Harry Myers, Apartment Life's publisher, was reported as saying of the do-it-yourselfers. Ms. Kalins presided over the magazine's transformation to Metropolitan Home and continued a storied career in publishing beyond that.
Among the disappointed subscribers was Mike Lamprecht. When he began reading Apartment Life in 1976, he was a 23-year-old graduate student in psychology at Iowa State University, in Ames. "I was living in pretty spartan conditions and looking for ways to dress it up that were affordable," he said.
"There were a lot of space solutions," he recalled of the magazine. "And a lot of things you could build yourself without having a lot of tools."
Mr. Lamprecht, who is now 69, remembered the early Metropolitan Home as "way more upscale, and I didn't have a use for it. They assumed that their readership had grown all the way up and was making more money and had bought houses. And the truth was I hadn't gotten to that point yet."
He kept his back issues of Apartment Life for years, dipping into them for ideas. At one point, he ordered a needlework kit through the magazine to make a cross-stitch sampler. "So I taught myself to cross-stitch," he said, "and got it framed and hung it over the fireplace."
The message: "Home Sweet Apartment."

Sick of Flying Coach? Try an Auction Bid For a First-Class Seat.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Fliers on some airlines can upgrade at a discounted rate to avoid what could be a cramped flight. With some cruise ships and even Amtrak getting in on the act, is bidding up worth it?
Flying to Tanzania for her honeymoon on Ethiopian Airlines in November, Amanda Meeks was ready to celebrate. So, when an email arrived inviting her to bid on business class seats for the leg of the journey between Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, she jumped on it, getting two seats for the less-than-three-hour flight for $ 590.
"We absolutely felt like we were splurging," said Ms. Meeks, a travel blogger in St. Louis, who paid $ 910 a person for her round-trip economy ticket from Chicago. Business class on the entire route can be five times that amount. "It was very much the 'It's our honeymoon, we only do this once, why not?' mind-set."
The why-nots among economy fliers are now generating what analysts believe may be millions of dollars for participating airlines that offer automated auctions for premium class seats on planes. The practice -- growing among foreign carriers with scant pickup domestically -- offers economy fliers the chance to upgrade at a discounted rate and improve what could be a cramped and sleepless long-haul flight.
"Travelers are happy to pay for things if it's an experience they're excited about," said Ken Harris, the founder and chief executive of Plusgrade, a technology company founded in 2009 that currently works with about 125 travel businesses, including Qantas, Japan Airlines and Etihad Airways, to run upgrade auctions.
Businesses like Plusgrade, which generated $ 3.5 billion in business last year, according to the company, are booming in the post-lockdown return to travel as fliers look to treat themselves, and airlines have more premium seats available because of the continued slowdown in business travel.
"Airlines are trying to convert leisure customers to high-end leisure customers," said Kevin Stamler, the founder and chief executive of SeatBoost, an auction service that currently works with three airlines, and has plans to start working with seven more this year. "It's the cheapest way to upgrade."
On two separate flights on foreign carriers last year, I was offered upgrade opportunities and made both winning and losing bids, which inspired me to look more closely at the practice. The following is what I learned, and explains why you might find upgrade auctions on your next flight, train ride or cruise.
How auctions work
Though participating airlines can set the terms and timing of the sales, most work like this: Within a week of departure, passengers get an email notifying them of an opportunity to bid on an upgrade. (Upgrades often are to business class but may also cover premium economy, a step up from economy with more legroom and often improved food and beverage service.)
The email usually sets a minimum bid, which is the threshold for participating, and sometimes a suggested bid above that. Bids apply to the total number of passengers in a reservation, so, for example, a $ 300 upgrade offer for a couple traveling together on the same booking would be $ 600 total. Bidding passengers supply a credit card for the payment in the event that it wins.
Most auctions are blind and fliers are notified of their win or loss within days or hours of departure.
How prices are set is vague. Last year on Austrian Airlines, I bid the minimum of 400 euros (then about $ 400) to fly in business class from Vienna to Chicago. My original economy ticket cost about $ 1,200 round trip; business class was close to four times that.
My bid was accepted and in addition to getting a lie-flat seat and better in-flight food, I gained access to the airport lounge, with more food and drink, work stations and sleeping pods, and my bag was among the first to come off the baggage carousel. For the start-to-finish 14-hour journey that spared me from the cramped coach class I experienced on the flight to Vienna, I thought the indulgence was worth it.
On a shorter flight in October, I bid the minimum, $ 200, on an Azores Airlines upgrade when returning from Ponta Delgada in the Azores to Boston, though the suggested starting bid was $ 250. I lost that campaign.
Both Plusgrade and SeatBoost said there was no formula to successful bidding, noting that flight dynamics, including how full a plane is, impacts auction results.
With SeatBoost, which works with Lufthansa, Avianca and TAP Air Portugal, auctions take place within three hours of a flight on the company's app, which shows competing bids and where they rank. As at a live auction, bidders can raise their offers. Auctions normally end just a few minutes before boarding.
"We're democratizing the upgrade process," Mr. Stamler said.
Is upgrading worth it?
Whether upgrading is worth the expense is entirely subjective. The auction services say results vary but tend to net 20 to 30 percent savings on the price of an upgrade.
On fall flights between Toronto and Warsaw, Julia Gifford bid about $ 300, just above the minimum, for an outbound trip in premium economy on LOT Polish Airlines. The original round-trip economy fare was about $ 800.
"I upgraded both directions after an excellent first experience," said Ms. Gifford, a Toronto native who lives in Riga, Latvia, where she runs a content marketing and public relations agency. She reported the food, the space and the mood of the flight attendants was much improved. "It was so worth it."
While airline prices are notoriously dynamic, looking at the same routing on current flights, the difference between economy and premium economy prices for standard fares before any auction is usually more than $ 300. According to recent prices, a successful upgrade bid of $ 300 appears to save between 7 to 30 percent over the price at the time of booking.
"I would definitely recommend it to people who wish to fly business and are not sure if it's worth it," said Shamarel O.E. Odusanya, a psychologist based in Dubai, who won a business class upgrade for about the price she paid for her economy seat (995 Emirati dirhams, or roughly $ 270) on an Etihad Airways flight from Dubai to Tel Aviv and avoided a hefty fee for an extra checked bag because it was included in the upgrade ticket. "I particularly enjoyed the calm of the lounge, which made what can be a stressful experience a rather enjoyable one."
Travelers may get other offers to upgrade directly from the airlines, sometimes immediately after they book a flight and even at the check-in counter at the airport.
Consumers set their threshold for engaging in auctions, which offers a degree of control.
"Ultimately, it's a win-win for the airline and the traveler," said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst who runs Atmosphere Research Group and recently won an upgrade auction to business class for $ 100 on a flight from Vienna to Warsaw, bringing the total cost of the ticket to $ 350, a third less than the $ 525 business class ticket available when he booked economy. "Airlines are collecting incremental revenue and being paid for a premium product. The passenger is winning because he or she is paying a price they feel is fair and meets their budget needs."
Upgrade services are banking on the premise that fliers are looser with their budgets once travel is upon them.
"When people are booking, they're extremely price sensitive," Mr. Stamler said. "But your purchasing behavior changes when you're traveling."
What about domestic flights?
You're more likely to buy an upgrade with cash or loyalty points on carriers based in the United States, where auctions are rare. Exceptions include Hawaiian Airlines, which operates many long-haul flights from the mainland to the islands.
Since 2021, Spirit Airlines has been using Plusgrade to auction its Big Front Seats (larger seats in the front rows) and exit row seats through a program it calls SeatBid. Fliers submit a bid through the website and are notified of its acceptance between 48 and two hours predeparture. Some flights offer an "Instant Level-Up" option at a discount to secure the upgrade immediately, similar to eBay's "Buy It Now" option.
But the big three legacy airlines -- American, Delta and United -- don't participate in premium class auctions. Often, empty seats in the forward cabins of planes are filled by frequent fliers upgraded by the airlines as a perk of loyalty.
"The U.S. carriers can't fulfill demand for upgrades that they promised elite loyalty members," Mr. Harteveldt said, adding that the airlines have been successful in pricing their premium and economy cabins in such a way that enough customers are upgrading during the booking stage.
Auction mania
Upgrade auctions have spilled over to other travel businesses, especially cruising.
Plusgrade began working with Norwegian Cruise Line in 2016. Since then, several lines have adopted the technology, including Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Virgin Voyages. In September, Princess announced its partnership with Plusgrade to offer cabin upgrades.
Given the variety of cabins on a cruise ship, passengers have options to upgrade from a standard inside cabin to a balcony cabin and beyond, including deluxe suites. Mr. Harris, the Plusgrade chief executive, said cruise upgrades have been popular, driven by the length of the trip.
Don Terris, an Ontario-based travel agent who analyzed the cruise upgrade bidding process in a YouTube video, won a bid at $ 1,500 on top of his basic fare to stay in a grand suite aboard a Royal Caribbean ship, which he said saved him more than $ 5,000 over booking the suite outright.
In 2021, Amtrak began auctioning its premium seats on trains with Plusgrade, which plans to roll out future auctions on train services in Europe.
There are plenty of websites that offer hotel booking discounts globally but few that offer upgrade auctions. Analysts say entry-level hotel rooms are not the equivalent of economy class airline seats.
"Airlines have done a remarkable job of making flying hell 30,000 feet above the earth," Mr. Harteveldt said. "Auctions work because they start with the fact that economy class sucks and travelers will consider all reasonable options to escape it."

“Ultimately, it’s a win-win for the airline and the traveler,” said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst who runs Atmosphere Research Group and recently won an upgrade auction to business class for $100 on a flight from Vienna to Warsaw, bringing the total cost of the ticket to $350, one-third less than the $525 business class ticket available when he booked economy. “Airlines are collecting incremental revenue and being paid for a premium product. The passenger is winning because he or she is paying a price they feel is fair and meets their budget needs.”
Upgrade services are banking on the premise that flyers are looser with their budgets once travel is upon them.
“When people are booking, they’re extremely price sensitive,” Stamler said. “But your purchasing behavior changes when you’re traveling.”
What About Domestic Flights?
You’re more likely to buy an upgrade with cash or loyalty points on carriers based in the United States, where auctions are rare. Exceptions include Hawaiian Airlines, which operates many long-haul flights from the mainland to the islands.
Since 2021, Spirit Airlines has been using Plusgrade to auction its Big Front Seats (larger seats in the front rows) and exit row seats through a program it calls SeatBid. Flyers submit a bid through the website and are notified of its acceptance between 48 and two hours predeparture. Some flights offer an “Instant Level-Up” option at a discount to secure the upgrade immediately, similar to eBay’s “Buy It Now” option.
But the big three legacy airlines — American, Delta and United — don’t participate in premium class auctions. Often, empty seats in the forward cabins of planes are filled by frequent flyers upgraded by the airlines as a perk of loyalty.
“The U.S. carriers can’t fulfill demand for upgrades that they promised elite loyalty members,” Harteveldt said, adding that the airlines have been successful in pricing their premium and economy cabins in such a way that enough customers are upgrading during the booking stage.
Auction Mania
Upgrade auctions have spilled over to other travel businesses, especially cruising.
Plusgrade began working with Norwegian Cruise Line in 2016. Since then, several lines have adopted the technology, including Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Virgin Voyages. In September, Princess announced its partnership with Plusgrade to offer cabin upgrades.
Given the variety of cabins on a cruise ship, passengers have options to upgrade from a standard inside cabin to a balcony cabin and beyond, including deluxe suites. Harris, the Plusgrade CEO, said cruise upgrades have been popular, driven by the length of the trip.
Don Terris, an Ontario-based travel agent who analyzed the cruise upgrade bidding process in a YouTube video, won a bid at $1,500 on top of his basic fare to stay in a grand suite aboard a Royal Caribbean ship, which he said saved him more than $5,000 over booking the suite outright.
In 2021, Amtrak began auctioning its premium seats on trains with Plusgrade, which plans to roll out future auctions on train services in Europe.
There are plenty of websites that offer hotel booking discounts globally but few that offer upgrade auctions. Analysts say entry-level hotel rooms are not the equivalent of economy class airline seats.
“Airlines have done a remarkable job of making flying hell 30,000 feet above the earth,” Harteveldt said. “Auctions work because they start with the fact that economy class sucks and travelers will consider all reasonable options to escape it.”

It was the 36th day of what was supposed to be a 30-day shoot in New Orleans, but the cast and crew of the rock drama "Daisy Jones & the Six" were still at it.
They were filming a scene, set in 1977, in which the actors Riley Keough and Sam Claflin, as the lead singers of the band Daisy Jones & the Six, unwind backstage after performing on "Saturday Night Live" for the first time. Half-empty liquor bottles, wood paneling, smoke-machine haze and framed photos of the Coneheads and Gilda Radner surround them.
Claflin, who plays Billy Dunne, asks Keough, in the title role of Daisy Jones: "How'd it feel?"
"It felt good, yeah," she says, "I mean, not as good as cocaine."
Before New Orleans, the cast and crew had filmed for 69 days in the Los Angeles area, and afterward some of them headed to Athens and the Greek island of Hydra for a key episode. Production on "Daisy Jones & the Six" was initially scheduled to begin in April 2020, and even after it was postponed because of Covid for about 18 months, it had to be suspended a few more times. Despite daily testing protocols and mask mandates, the reality of filming concerts with hundreds of extras, hookup scenes and booze-and-Quaalude-fueled bacchanals had taken a toll.
"Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll is hard to do in a pandemic," said Lauren Neustadter, who with Reese Witherspoon executive-produced the series.
"Daisy Jones & the Six" tells the story of a band's rise to sold-out-stadium-level fame thanks to a hit album, "Aurora." The musicians make and promote "Aurora" as Daisy, Billy and his wife, Camila Dunne (Camila Morrone), try to navigate the sharp edges of a love triangle.
It's based on a 2019 novel of the same name by Taylor Jenkins Reid that has sold more than 1 million e-book and print copies, according to NPD BookScan, and has been translated into more than 30 languages. Part of its appeal is the storytelling approach: Reid creates an oral history that reads like nonfiction, populating it with musicians and record producers who reminisce against the backdrop of beater vans, tour buses and Sunset Strip stages.
To answer many Google searches: The Six is not a real band, though it's inspired by Fleetwood Mac and others. Still, that uncertainty -- as well as the will-they-or-won't-they tension between Keough's and Claflin's characters -- is something Witherspoon's production company, Hello Sunshine, and Amazon Studios hope will grip viewers when "Daisy Jones & the Six" begins streaming its 10 episodes on Amazon Prime Video, starting March 3.
For Hello Sunshine, "Daisy Jones" could affirm its book-to-screen dominance after its successes with the film "Where the Crawdads Sing" and the Netflix series "From Scratch." For Reid, whose books have become coveted source material in Hollywood, this will be the first adaptation to reach audiences, so its popularity is likely to influence the market for her material. For the up-and-coming actors in the cast, many of whom sidelined other projects to stick with "Daisy Jones" amid its realigned shooting schedule, it's a chance to break out.
The built-in fan base that the book provides will be a boon for the series but also brings its own anxieties. "There is for me a desire to make the fans happy and bring to life this book that has lived in their hearts and in all of our hearts for so long," Morrone said. "I don't think I've ever done a project that has this many eyes on it."
It is one of the first projects that the head of Amazon Studios, Jennifer Salke, ordered after Jeff Bezos hired her in 2018. "You have to make noise," she said, discussing her early days at the company and her reaction to the "Daisy Jones" pitch. "You have to be able to do something that is different. It can't feel like a show that you could just get everywhere."
"Daisy Jones" promised to deliver that, she said, and Amazon stood by the production as it waited out the restrictions of the pandemic.
Covid delays provided a significant benefit: more than a year for the actors to take music lessons. Before then, the most noteworthy musical credential any of them had was that Keough is Elvis Presley's granddaughter.
'I need you to bring your iPad to the beach tomorrow'
If streaming-television economics are under pressure, as layoffs at Disney, Netflix and other companies indicate, you would not know it from Amazon's investment in "Daisy Jones & the Six."
The 1970s-era sets are designed to shag-carpeted verisimilitude. For a week, the production took over the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, using vintage pornography as a visual reference when they transformed the Viper Room into the seedy Filthy McNasty's. The principal characters alone required 1,500 wardrobe changes in the first half of production. With other characters and extras, the production sometimes needed 250 outfits a night.
About 25 original songs have been written by Blake Mills, who wrote some in collaboration with others, including Phoebe Bridgers, Marcus Mumford and Chris Weisman. Eleven of those songs make up "Aurora," which Atlantic Records will release when the series begins streaming. The first track, "Regret Me," dropped earlier this month and by mid-February had garnered about 2 million streams on Spotify.
Even the show's P.R. efforts hark back to the era of big-studio budgets: More than 30 publicists were involved (or hoped to be involved) in the reporting, photographing and fact-checking of this article. The photo shoot drew multiple entourages.
But the TV version of "Daisy Jones" started small, with a wife and husband in Los Angeles.
The husband is Scott Neustadter, a screenwriter whose credits include the 2009 movie "500 Days of Summer," which he wrote with Michael H. Weber.
One day in 2017, Neustadter's representatives got a call from Brad Mendelsohn, Reid's manager, asking if the screenwriter might want to take a look at a manuscript about a fictional 1970s rock band whose trajectory and interpersonal drama resembled Fleetwood Mac's. Neustadter, a fan of that era's music, started reading it that morning.
He got in touch later that day with his wife, Lauren Neustadter, who had just been hired by Witherspoon to lead Hello Sunshine's film and TV division. He reminded her that he and Witherspoon had once talked about being captivated by Stevie Nicks. "I knew this was a passion of Reese's," he said.
Lauren spent a few hours reading Reid's manuscript. Then she interrupted her boss's vacation. "I need you to bring your iPad to the beach tomorrow morning," she remembered emailing Witherspoon, "because this book is so good, and it's going to be so competitive."
The next morning, she said, Witherspoon replied: "I'm obsessed."
'I have prepared my whole life to write this'
Days later, the Neustadters hatched a plan.
Lauren took Reid to breakfast at Hugo's, in the San Fernando Valley. As she was praising the book, her phone rang.
"I think this is for you," Neustadter said, handing it to Reid, who by then had achieved modest success as an author. She maintained her chill, at least on the outside, as she listened to Witherspoon tell her how much she loved her book.
That afternoon, Scott took Reid to lunch at a coffee shop on Larchmont Avenue. "I told her I have prepared my whole life to write this," meaning a film or TV version of "Daisy Jones," he said.
Reid decided she wanted Hello Sunshine to spearhead the screen version, with Scott and his writing partner Weber attached as creators. She ultimately sold the "Daisy Jones" manuscript to Penguin Random House.
In May 2018, Lauren Neustadter and Witherspoon met Salke for lunch at Tavern, a restaurant in Brentwood. Salke, a former NBC executive, told them she was looking for big, ambitious projects that could benefit from the breadth of Amazon, including its ability to market and sell books, audiobooks, music and merchandise.
"They teased me with something, but they wouldn't tell me what it was," Salke said. "They were like, 'We might have something right up your alley."'
On a Friday in July, Neustadter sent her the "Daisy Jones" manuscript, a series overview and a script for the pilot episode, written by her husband and Weber, and said Salke had the weekend to consider it before Hello Sunshine would shop the series to others. Salke ordered it to series on Monday. "We just were really invested from the get-go," she said.
The following March, the novel came out and was named the pick for Witherspoon's book club. It sailed onto the New York Times best-seller list, as did one of Reid's earlier books, "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo." That novel's paperback version has now spent more than 100 weeks on the list, and Netflix said last year that it is planning a screen adaptation.
'I was put on this earth to be Daisy'
A few months later, the producers began to think about casting. Lauren Neustadter received a call from Alexandra Trustman, one of Hello Sunshine's agents at C.A.A., who suggested one of her other clients, Riley Keough, for the role of Daisy.
Keough had recently finished filming Janicza Bravo's film "Zola," in which she played a stripper, when she met in May 2019 with the Neustadters, along with Will Graham, who shared the job of being the showrunner of "Daisy Jones" with Scott Neustadter; and Mendelsohn, an executive producer of the series.
"I was put on this earth to be Daisy," Keough told them.
Keough declined an interview request in the weeks after the death of her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, but in an email, she said that it was the character's combination of strength and vulnerability that moved her. "Daisy is complicated," she wrote. "I didn't identify with Daisy's desire to sing and write songs, because that's something I had never done. What I connected with was Daisy's artistry and how she felt, not being taken seriously as a young woman."
She was one of several actors playing musicians who first came to the roles without much musical training. Suki Waterhouse, a novice pianist when she was cast, plays the keyboardist Karen Sirko. Will Harrison, who was in a band in college, plays the lead guitarist Graham Dunne. Sebastian Chacon, who had drummed a bit, plays the drummer Warren Rojas (in the book, his last name is Rhodes). Josh Whitehouse, who actually knows how to play guitar, was cast as Eddie Roundtree, the bassist.
Claflin, as Billy Dunne, was the final band member cast. He had never played guitar. As part of an audition, he began to sing Elton John's "Your Song," before the musical supervisor urged him to stop. When Tony Berg -- the veteran producer who has worked with artists including Bob Dylan, Aimee Mann and Phoebe Bridgers, and who is the show's music consultant -- asked Claflin to sing a Beatles song, the actor couldn't think of one.
"Out of everyone involved in this project, my knowledge of '70s music, '70s L.A., '70s anything -- especially in America and especially in the music sphere -- was very, very, very lackluster," Claflin said in an interview.
The producers were determined to make it work. "We were going to lean on movie magic," Lauren Neustadter said.
After the pandemic upended the 2020 production schedule, the actors threw themselves into music. "I was incredibly into the idea of having three hours of piano lessons every single day," Waterhouse said. "This is something that nobody gets a chance to do."
'They sounded like a real band'
The work of transforming actors pretending to be in a band into a band became the professional preoccupation of the music supervisor Frankie Pine. She oversaw a monthslong "band camp" consisting of one-on-one instruction and group rehearsal, in addition to taking and reviewing video footage of practice sessions so they could listen to their pitch and timing and watch their comportment.
"I wanted to really try to create a sense that this is a real band," Pine said. "When you're a real band, you hang out together, you eat together, you drink together, you bitch to each other. You go through the normal motions of a group of people that are constantly together. So I was really trying to create this camaraderie that a true rock 'n' roll band has."
As the production prepared to start shooting in Los Angeles in September 2021, Lauren Neustadter felt it was important for the band to put on a live concert, performing songs from the show. They rented a Hollywood studio with a stage and, still limited by Covid, invited about 40 people who were working on the series.
In attendance was Tom Wright, a veteran actor ("Tales From the Hood," "Sunshine State") who plays Teddy Price, the Berry Gordy-Quincy Jones-esque record producer. He was prepared to be underwhelmed.
As a young actor, Wright lived in New York in the 1970s and had a roommate in the music business. "I got to know and hang out with people like Ornette Coleman and Chet Baker and Jim Hall -- you know, some great jazz musicians. And I got to see them perform live, so I kind of have a high bar," he said.
At the friends-and-family concert, "I was shocked," Wright said. "They sounded like a real band. It was incredible."
If this was the band's smallest-scale concert, the largest was in New Orleans, where the production design team refitted the 26,500-seat Tad Gormley Stadium to appear, on camera at least, as if it were Soldier Field in Chicago, where the story's biggest concert occurs.
This was the accomplishment of the show's production designer Jessica Kender, who said that because the look of the 1970s is so recognizable, details mattered. A scene at a gas station, for example, required them to remove ethanol warnings on the pumps that wouldn't have been there decades ago.
When Nzingha Stewart, who directed four episodes, envisioned a montage in which Billy and Daisy visited dozens of radio stations, the production design crew built one radio broadcasting booth that Kender remade over and over again with decals and details summoning Tulsa, Dallas and Fort Worth. In a concert scene, merch stands are piled with band T-shirts, like one with a sepia photo of Keough that reads, "Daisy Jones and the Six: Amsterdam, the Netherlands 5 Jun 1976."
Denise Wingate, the costume designer, once traveled with the 1980s band the Bangles. When she read "Daisy Jones," she said, "I was like, 'I have to do it."' During the pandemic delay, she spent hours every day searching eBay and vintage sites. Once lockdowns eased, she said, "I went to flea markets every weekend for a year."
And she fielded requests. When Keough asked for "Stevie Nicks vibes" for the Soldier Field performance, Wingate found a Halston caftan in gold lamé that she cut up the front to turn it into a cape and paired with a vintage metallic crochet dress. ("Daisy's wardrobe was a true highlight of my life," Keough wrote.)
To find inspiration for the "Aurora" album cover, Wingate made a mood board featuring Nicks in a billowing white dress. In the cover that resulted, Billy is in a denim shirt and Daisy wears a dress similar to the one Nicks wore, which Wingate had made. Just as it is described in the book, the rock stars are staring into each other's eyes, but a space exists between them.
For Reid, who imagined this story and took it from her head to paper starting in 2016, it's hard to believe it's all happening. "If your book is like your baby," she said, "then the adaptation is like my grandchild. I don't really get to take credit, but boy am I so proud of them."
She is thrilled by the show, she said. "When I think of Daisy now, I see Riley's face. When I think of Billy, I think of Sam."

The Busy Furniture Hustlers of Silicon Valley: [Correction]

Full text: As tech companies cut costs and move to remote work, their left-behind office furniture has become part of a booming trade.
Brandi Susewitz touched the curved stitching on a pair of bright red Arne Jacobsen Egg Chairs and announced they were worth around $ 5,000 each. The chairs were in pristine condition, perched in the reception area of the software company Sitecore's office in downtown San Francisco.
Trisha Murcia, Sitecore's workplace manager, said she was likely the only person who ever sat on them. "It's really sad," she said. "They opened this office in 2018 and then Covid happened."
Ms. Murcia led Ms. Susewitz around Sitecore's office, pointing out bar stools that had never been used, 90-inch flat screens, shiny conference room tables and accent chairs from the retailer Blu Dot. The whiteboard walls, outfitted with markers and erasers, were spotless. And rows upon rows of 30-by-60-inch, height-adjustable Knoll desks with Herman Miller Aeron chairs sat collecting dust.
Ms. Susewitz measured and snapped photos, identifying designer brands and models. Her office furniture resale business, Reseat, would take all of it, she declared. "We can find a home for this," she said. "We have time."
Ms. Susewitz, who started Reseat in 2020, is one of an increasing number of behind-the-scenes specialists in the Bay Area who are carving out a piece of the great office furniture reshuffling. There are professional liquidators, Craigslist flippers and start-ups spouting buzzwords like "circular economy." And a few guys with warehouses full of really nice chairs.
All of them are capitalizing on a wave of tech companies that are drastically shrinking their physical footprints in the wake of the pandemic-induced shift to remote work and the recent economic slowdown.
Nowhere is the furniture glut stronger than in San Francisco. Tech workers have been slowest to return to the office in the city, where commercial vacancy rates jumped to 28 percent last year, up from 4 percent in 2019, according to the real estate firm CBRE. Occupancy in San Francisco in late January was 4 percent below the average of the top 10 U.S. cities, according to the building security firm Kastle. And companies of all sizes, including PayPal, Block and Yelp, are giving up their expensive downtown headquarters or downsizing their office space.
Add to that the tech industry's recent U-turn from optimistic hypergrowth to fear and penny pinching. That has led tech giants such as Google and Salesforce, along with smaller companies like DoorDash and Wish, to carry out widespread layoffs, cutting more than 88,000 workers in the Bay Area over the last year, according to Layoffs.fyi.
Some start-ups have abruptly gone under, including the flying car company Kittyhawk, the autonomous vehicle start-up Argo AI and the interior design start-up Modsy. Others have slashed spending, starting with their dusty, rarely used offices full of designer furniture.
Last month, Twitter held a public auction for some of its furniture, hawking dry erase boards, conference tables and a three-foot blue statue of its bird logo. The social media company, which is owned by Elon Musk, at one point stopped paying the rent on some of its office leases.
Martin Pichinson, a founder of Sherwood Partners, an advisory firm that helps restructure failing start-ups, said he was staffing up to handle increased demand. Today's reckoning was not as severe as that of the dot-com bust in the early 2000s when dozens of tech companies collapsed, he said, but "everyone is acting as if businesses are falling apart."
That's led to a lot of expendable furniture, much of it hewing to a specific youthful aesthetic of Instagrammable bright colors and midcentury modern shapes. That look, complemented by plant walls of succulents and kombucha on tap, was a hallmark of the tech talent wars over the past two decades, telegraphing a company's success and sophistication.
Then there's the Aeron chairs. The $ 1,805 black roller-wheel desk chairs are a closely-watched barometer of tech excesses. Their sleek design makes them a work of art, according to the Museum of Modern Art. And in the tech industry, where workers are used to being pampered while chained to their desks, they are ubiquitous.
When internet companies imploded in 2000, liquidators filled their warehouses with the "dot-com thrones." Now any whiff of empty Aerons piling up conjures memories of that slump and sets off fears that another is imminent.
The Bay Area's Craigslist currently has gobs of the chairs for sale, photographed in warehouses, lined up in corners of conference rooms and wrapped in plastic outside a storage unit. Some are selling for as cheap as a few hundred bucks.
The listings are a reminder: Silicon Valley is a place of booms and busts, with enterprising hustlers who see nothing but opportunity, even in the rubble.
A trail of Dropbox furniture
For furniture specialists, it all starts with supplies from tech companies like Dropbox.
In 2019, the file storage company moved into its 735,000-square-foot headquarters in San Francisco. Its 15-year lease was the largest in the city's history at the time. Dropbox's old office was rented to other companies, and last year, a cache of furniture -- futuristic-chic chairs, couches and tables -- from that office made its way to a liquidator.
The inventory included several emerald green velvet Jean Royère-style Polar Bear chairs that cost roughly $ 10,000 to custom make in 2016, according to their maker, Classic Design LA.
Three of those chairs sold to Tenzin Norbu, a furniture reseller in Richmond, Calif., who paid around $ 1,000 for each. Mr. Norbu, 25, started buying and selling high-end furniture on online marketplaces early in the pandemic, when people were eager to redecorate the homes they were stuck inside and stymied by supply chain delays on furniture.
Since then, his business, called Enliven, has expanded to include a van, three employees, a 4,000-square-foot warehouse and annual revenue in the mid-six figures.
The tech talent wars, with companies competing to out-perk one another with the fanciest offices, were good for designer furniture. The retreat from that battle has been just as good for resellers.
Last year, Mr. Norbu scored some lounge chairs and couches from Fast, a payments start-up that collapsed in the spring. He also paid "tens of thousands" of dollars, he said, to fill a 20-foot truck of still-in-the-box furniture that WeWork, whose valuation had plummeted, had kept in storage since 2019. The trove included dining chairs, lamps, couches and a chunky red Bollo armchair by the Swedish designer Fogia.
On a recent tour of his warehouse, Mr. Norbu pointed out a pair of never-used felt poufs from a start-up, two glass coffee tables from Delta Air Lines, some gray lounge chairs that were "probably from Google" and plants from a venture capital firm.
Mr. Norbu aims to target more tech start-ups as his business expands. The companies are always acquiring or shedding furniture, since they tend to grow quickly and shut down abruptly. Many of his buyers also work in tech, he said, which means they could find themselves eating dinner at the very conference table they once gathered around for meetings.
Last year, Mr. Norbu sold one of the Polar Bear chairs that had been owned by Dropbox to a fellow furniture flipper, Nate Morgan, for $ 1,400. Mr. Morgan started trading furniture in the fall after he was laid off from a business development job at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. He said he quickly discovered the Bay Area contains "crazy pockets of massive amounts of furniture."
Mr. Morgan's business, Reclamation, recently worked with a wealthy tech entrepreneur who had bought a second San Francisco home to live in while his main home was being renovated. The entrepreneur furnished the 4,000-square-foot second home with new goods from Restoration Hardware. Nine months later, when the entrepreneur moved into his main home, Mr. Morgan bought all of the second home's furniture for 10 percent of its retail price.
Mr. Morgan, 44, said the furniture business was a welcome shift from the 15 years he spent working in tech. "It feels really good to be building a local community business that's tied to this geographic area," he said.
Mr. Morgan later sold the Polar Bear chair that had been at Dropbox for a profit to an interior designer in Los Angeles, who then sold it to a client in the Hollywood Hills. From the liquidator, to Mr. Norbu, to Mr. Morgan, to the interior designer, each person in the chain made a little money.
Dropbox declined to comment. During the pandemic, the company shifted to remote work and made plans to sublet 80 percent of its headquarters. Takers have been slow; the company recently lowered its expected rate, pushed out its target for finding tenants by two years and recorded a $ 175 million charge on its real estate holdings in 2022.
Dropbox's remaining space has been converted into what the company calls a "studio" instead of an "office," designed for meetings and "touchdown spots," or cafes and libraries for people to sit, chat and work briefly. There are no more desks.
'It was a ghost town'
Ms. Susewitz, 49, has worked in office furniture since 1997, when she became a customer service representative at Lindsay-Ferrari, a Bay Area furniture dealer now known as One Workplace.
The furniture industry's wastefulness always bugged her, she said, with companies discarding durable, commercial-grade items that were built to last decades every time they moved. Companies waited until the last minute to deal with the furniture, she said, increasing the odds it wound up in the trash.
In the late 1990s dot-com boom, Ms. Susewitz created a business plan to build an online marketplace for used office furniture. She abandoned it when eBay took off, thinking the company would eventually solve the problem. "But that never happened," she said.
Over the next two decades, she worked in sales and business development, outfitting Bay Area businesses with goods from "the big five" of workplace furniture -- Steelcase, MillerKnoll, Haworth, Allsteel and Teknion.
When the pandemic hit, Ms. Susewitz's livelihood of new office furniture screeched to a halt. She watched with disgust as companies tossed out barely used desks and chairs.
"Perfectly good, brand-new furniture is just being carted off to landfills," she said.
So she created Reseat to help businesses liquidate furniture. The company uses an inventory management system that tracks the items' "life cycles" so it can quickly share the specifications for the furniture, making the goods easier to sell. Given enough time, sellers can expect 20 cents on the dollar for their furniture, she said. Reseat, which has 14 employees, has worked with more than 100 companies and sold more than eight million pounds of furniture.
"Our goal is to sell it standing," Ms. Susewitz said. "Once it ends up in a warehouse, it loses value and ends up collecting dust."
In December, Reseat was hired to liquidate more than 900 work stations, 96 office chairs, 40 work benches, 24 sofas and 84 file cabinets at an office in Santa Clara, Calif. Analog Devices, the semiconductor company that had moved out, hardly used the space during the pandemic. But Pure Storage, the data storage company moving in, didn't want those pieces. Reseat had just four weeks to sell the items.
"It just ate me up inside," Ms. Susewitz said. That she found buyers in time was "a miracle," she added.
Pure Storage said it was reusing a "substantial" amount of Analog Devices' furniture, including desk chairs and conference room items, but it planned to install its existing desks "to better suit how Pure employees work in a more open office environment." An Analog Devices representative declined to comment.
Ms. Susewitz was excited about the furniture at Sitecore because the company had contacted Reseat months ahead of its move, setting it up to easily find a home for its goods. At Sitecore's office, she showed off how to identify the size of an Aeron chair. Each one has a set of plastic bumps hidden on its back. Two bumps indicate the most common size, a "B."
There were 16 size Bs around a wooden conference table that Sitecore had built using wood from a houseboat that was in Sausalito, Calif. In the center, a basin filled with Legos was flanked by the universal emblems of the pandemic: a bottle of Purell and a package of Clorox wipes.
Before the pandemic, Sitecore was expanding its space so rapidly that it had leased another half of a floor in its office tower. But "once the pandemic hit, it was a ghost town," said Brad Hamilton, the company's head of real estate and facilities.
Sitecore plans to downgrade to 30 desks from 170. "We're paying an outrageous amount of money for a floor that nobody uses," he said.
Toward the end of the office tour, Ms. Susewitz surveyed Sitecore's empty kitchen area, outfitted with a Ping-Pong table, a Ms. Pac-Man machine and two curved, six-foot privacy coves. Ms. Susewitz said she would take everything, except for the plates and silverware.
Chair influencers
One result of the furniture trading is a lot more people logging into Zoom meetings from very nice chairs -- and not only in the Bay Area.
In January, Gilad Rom, a software engineer in Los Angeles, decided to upgrade his work station at home. He searched Craigslist and found a seller with 500 Aeron chairs -- apparently acquired from a SiriusXM office that had shifted to remote work -- in Culver City, Calif.
When he posted a picture of the chairs gathered in a room, their black foam arms intertwined, the reaction was explosive. Some people wanted to score their own cheap Aeron. Many more wanted to reminisce about what the empty chairs represented -- corporate excess gone awry.
"I think it brought back a lot of memories," Mr. Rom, 43, said. "Flashbacks from 2008 and 2000."
The seller, a secondhand furniture shop called Wannasofa, was so overwhelmed with calls after Mr. Rom's tweet that the store gave him a 25 percent discount. "Apparently I'm a chair influencer now," he said.
The reaction also gave him an idea.
"Maybe I should build an app that helps people find cheap luxury furniture," he said. "Maybe there's something there."

Tax Changes to Know About: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Doing taxes in 2023 feels a lot like it did before the pandemic. Still, there are some meaningful changes to keep in mind.
The 2023 tax filing season is probably most notable for what's missing: After three years of stimulus payments and pandemic tax breaks, nearly all of those extra benefits have faded away -- and tax refunds are likely to shrink as a result.
The child tax credit, which was more generous in 2021 and had lifted millions of children out of poverty, along with the earned-income tax credit, have largely returned to their prepandemic size. Charitable donations for people who do not itemize their deductions have also expired.
"A lot of the special benefits were temporary, and lot of those things have rolled off at this point," said Eric Bronnenkant, head of tax at Betterment, a financial services firm in New York. "We are returning to normal."
There are still plenty of other meaningful changes, quirky rules and new layers of tax tediousness to be mindful of before you file your federal tax return, which is due by April 18 (though if you file for an extension, you have until Oct. 16).
Here's what you need to know:
I take a deduction for mileage. Has anything changed this year?
Yes. With surging gas prices, the I.R.S. made a rare change in the middle of the year: It increased the amount that taxpayers can deduct for gas mileage, benefiting taxpayers who take the mileage deduction for business purposes and medical expenses. Active duty military members can also take a deduction for the costs of moving.
For the last six months of the year, from July 1 to the end of 2022, the business-related mileage rate rose to 62.5 cents per mile, up from 58.5 cents for miles driven Jan. 1 to June 30.
Taxpayers always have the option of calculating the actual costs of using their vehicle rather than using the standard mileage rates. "However, that would require not just being able to document the business miles, but also all other business expenses related to the vehicle," said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting, a tax software and analysis firm.
Taxpayers who itemize their returns may also use the deduction for miles driven related to medical expenses; that rate is 22 cents a mile for the second half of 2022, up from 18 cents, the rate for the first half of the year. The mileage rate is the same for military members' moving expenses (available even if they do not itemize).
What tax breaks are available if I bought an electric car or made my home more energy-efficient?
There are a few -- but more generous tax incentives can be claimed next tax season thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in August and expanded and extended many incentives. A recent guide from our colleagues, Nadja Popovich and Elena Shao, goes into greater detail.
For the 2022 tax year, however, taxpayers can claim a lifetime credit of up to $ 500 for qualified home improvement expenses related to energy efficiency, such as replacing exterior doors, windows, insulation materials or water heaters. But starting in 2023, the credit increases to $ 1,200 each year for certain improvements made through 2032. Additionally, there's another credit worth up to $ 2,000 annually for various new water heaters and heat pumps. Together, the credits are worth up to $ 3,200 for each year through 2032, Mr. Luscombe said.
The residential clean energy property credit -- for items like solar panels or wind turbines -- was also extended, through 2034. From 2022 to 2032, the credit is 30 percent of qualified costs.
Buyers of new electric cars in 2022 can claim a credit of up to $ 7,500, but a new qualifying factor was added to the mix over the summer: Vehicles purchased last year between Aug. 17 and Dec. 31 must have undergone final assembly in North America. You can find out where your vehicle was assembled on the U.S. Department of Energy's website. (Cars bought before Aug. 17 and received before 2023 aren't subject to that requirement.)
The credit is still available for new vehicles purchased from 2023 to 2032, but eligibility rules -- now subject to limits on taxpayer income and the car's price -- and other requirements have changed.
Install a charging station for your electric vehicle at your primary home last year? There's a credit available, as long as the station meets certain requirements.
I received a one-time payment from my state. Is it taxable as income?
For most taxpayers, no. But it could be taxable for certain people living in Georgia, Massachusetts, South Carolina or Virginia.
Some quick background: Nearly two dozen states issued one-time payments to certain residents in 2022, usually to ease the sting of inflation. There was confusion about whether taxpayers were obligated to report the money as taxable income on their federal tax returns because the I.R.S. hadn't provided any guidance before tax season began.
Nearly three weeks into tax season, they had an answer: While general payments made by states are usually deemed taxable income for federal tax purposes, there are exceptions that would apply to most of these payments.
Sixteen states' payments were deemed not taxable because the I.R.S. said it viewed them as disaster or welfare payments, which are generally not taxable. Those states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. (The agency provided a chart that listed specific state payments that would not be taxable.)
In Alaska, dividend payments that are regularly made to residents generally are taxable, but the state's supplemental energy relief payment will not be.
The situation is more nuanced in Georgia, Massachusetts, South Carolina and Virginia, where the I.R.S. determined that payments may be taxable: Taxpayers who claim the standard deduction (and most do) will not need to report the state payments as income. But taxpayers who itemize their deductions will -- if the payment provides an extra tax benefit.
How would a taxpayer get an added benefit? People who itemize receive a federal deduction for taxes paid to state and local governments (including property taxes), also known as the SALT deduction, which is capped at $ 10,000 annually.
If a taxpayer owed $ 5,000 in state taxes but received a $ 500 state refund, that would mean the net payment to the government was $ 4,500. But the taxpayer would have reported $ 5,000 to the federal government for the SALT deduction, which would be overclaiming, explained Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation. The solution, he explained, is to treat the payment as income.
What did the I.R.S. do with savings and tax brackets limits to ease the sting of inflation?
When a dollar buys less than it used to, the I.R.S. lets you put more of it away -- if you can afford to, at least.
In 2023, the maximum amount of money you can save in most workplace retirement amounts -- pretax -- will be $ 22,500, up from $ 20,500 in 2022. The cap on annual I.R.A. contributions will be $ 6,500, up from $ 6,000.
The tax brackets have changed, too. For people in the 24 percent federal tax bracket, for instance, that rate will kick in for incomes over $ 95,375 in 2023, or $ 190,750 if you're married and filing your taxes jointly. That's up from $ 89,075 for single individuals and $ 178,150 for married couples filing jointly in 2022. There are similar changes in other brackets.
Not everything is subject to such adjustments. People age 50 and over in most workplace retirement plans can save an extra $ 7,500 in 2023 beyond the normal $ 22,500 cap, up from $ 6,500 in 2022. Cost-of-living changes to these so-called catch-up contributions do not apply to I.R.A.s, however. There, the extra savings for the 50-and-up group remain at $ 1,000.
In the world of tax-advantaged flexible spending accounts, the cap on the money you can set aside in a health care one is $ 3,050 in 2023, up from $ 2,850 in 2022. But dependent care accounts don't change; the cap there stays at $ 5,000 per household, where it's been for decades. States tend not to adjust tax breaks for their 529 college savings accounts either.
I regularly use Venmo and other online payment services. Why is the I.R.S. coming after me?
If you get paid through online payment processors like Venmo, PayPal or eBay, there are some changes coming, but the I.R.S. pushed back the effective date to Jan. 1, 2023.
Small businesses, self-employed people and gig workers have always been required to track and report their own income so they can calculate their tax bill. But now, the federal government said it planned to collect more of those tax dollars from people who received business income through online payment processors. A new law will require the processors to issue tax forms, called 1099-Ks, that will capture more of the sellers' activity and report it to the I.R.S.
Before the changes, the processors issued 1099-Ks to taxpayers selling goods or services once their activity exceeded 200 transactions and $ 20,000 in aggregate payments annually. But new 2021 rules lowered that threshold to $ 600, with no transaction minimums. It's now effective for the 2023 tax year.
People selling items -- like a used couch or bike -- through online marketplaces aren't supposed to be affected by the new rules. If you paid $ 1,200 for a couch and sold it for $ 650, for example, you didn't make a profit -- that's generally not taxable and you don't need to report on your federal return, experts said.
Sending cash gifts or reimbursing a friend for your share of a restaurant tab shouldn't be captured by the new law either -- as long as these transactions are properly categorized on the app as between friends and family.
But mistakes happen, and it's possible (probable?) you'll get a 1099-K in error. In that case, you may need to report that you sold that couch at a loss on your federal return, Mr. Bronnenkant, of Betterment, explained.
Are there any tax consequences when my student loan balance is erased via a government program?
Probably not. Debt cancellation is generally counted as taxable income, but legislative changes make an exception for most student loan borrowers whose debt has been discharged from 2021 through 2025.
This covers loans held by borrowers who were defrauded by their schools, for example, or who qualified under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.
Many -- but not all -- states mirror the federal government's treatment, so you may owe state tax, according to Wolters Kluwer.
Are there any changes affecting retirement accounts that I should keep in mind this year or in the coming years?
Yes. Legislation signed into law in late December makes it easier for certain people to save for retirement (mostly those with the wherewithal to save) on a tax-advantaged basis. But many of those changes didn't take effect until this year and others don't start until much later.
For example, retirees will be required to begin withdrawing money from their tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s and traditional individual retirement accounts -- known as required minimum distributions -- the year a person turns 73, up from 72. The previous age had been 70½.
And starting in 2025, people ages 60 to 63 will be able to set aside more for retirement -- with larger catch-up contributions -- which could lower their tax bill.
Are there any changes coming to Roth I.R.A.'s?
Yes. Here's an intriguing one: The new legislation from December will also make it possible for some people to roll over up to $ 35,000 from a 529 savings plan to a Roth I.R.A.
For years, lobbyists had worried that people were not saving for college (or not saving enough) because of concerns that they might not need the money, say, if a child doesn't end up going to college.
Starting in 2024, leftover money from a 529 plan can be moved to the account beneficiary's Roth I.R.A. There are limits though, including existing Roth contribution restrictions. Moreover, the 529 account in question has to be at least 15 years old, and you can't roll over money that you deposited (or earnings from those deposits) from the previous five years.
Still, careful planners could deliberately oversave in a 529 plan to give a young adult a head start on retirement savings.
What's changing for teachers?
For the first time, the tax deduction that educators for kindergarten through 12th grade can take is rising. It's available for unreimbursed expenses like books, equipment and courses related to their work.
Since 2002, the deduction has been no more than $ 250. For 2022, it is $ 300.
Educators and the accountants that serve them are cheering. "Every one of our teacher clients qualifies," said Erin Louis, an accountant in Seattle. "Teachers here are constantly spending money out of their own pockets."
It's been a bad year for crypto investors. Are they getting any new relief?
Not really. Existing tax law does allow people to take tax deductions for losses, and those rules apply to digital assets like crypto.
But the I.R.S. is staying in your face this year about declaring any winnings. Once again, there is a question on this year's tax forms that everyone must answer about crypto and similar holdings: "At any time during 2022, did you: (a) receive (as a reward, award or payment for property or services); or (b) sell, exchange, gift or otherwise dispose of a digital asset (or a financial interest in a digital asset)?"
Minnie Lau, an accountant in San Francisco, said that her clients were disappointed that a lingering question about the taxability of certain crypto assets remained unresolved. It involves whether rewards, in the form of digital assets, for so-called staking were taxable the moment you get those rewards or only when you sell or otherwise dispose of them.
Crypto investors were hopeful that a court case would settle the matter, but that did not happen this year. Ms. Lau said that she was taking the conservative approach and having clients pay taxes as soon as they were able to withdraw any rewards. In an interview, David Kemmerer, chief executive of the tax and portfolio-tracking software provider CoinLedger, said that his company was making a similar recommendation, as were other tax experts.

Full text: The Parisian restaurant known as the unofficial headquarters for the fashion set made its New York debut on a recent evening.
"Hey, can we smoke in here?" asked the actress Natasha Lyonne, 43, in a leopard print dress, holding a pack of cigarettes. She was standing inside the newly opened Caviar Kaspia on the Upper East Side, a sister restaurant to the original in Paris. On Friday, Lauren Santo Domingo, the socialite and co-founder of Moda Operandi, hosted a party there to kick off New York Fashion Week.
"Not when the mayor is here!" Ms. Santo Domingo, 46, responded.
"Come on, you're the owner!" Ms. Lyonne said, turning to Sarah Senbahar. Ms. Senbahar and her husband and property developer, Izak Senbahar, own The Mark Hotel in New York, which had partnered with Caviar Kaspia as part of the Parisian restaurant's global expansion.
The guest list of celebrities, fashionistas and the rich and powerful for the evening included Mayor Eric Adams, nattily dressed in a burgundy blazer ("It's one of my favorite colors. I like the wine-ish color," he said), who was chatting with Marie-Chantal, the Crown Princess of Greece and Princess of Denmark, and the fashion designer Tory Burch. The pop singer Lily Allen, the actor Justin Theroux and the former political aide Huma Abedin stood nearby. Generous dollops of Osetra caviar were served on twice-baked potatoes (the dish can cost anywhere from $ 95 to $ 540, depending on the type and amount of caviar), with the champagne and vodka freely flowing.
There is a permissive sensibility to the original Caviar Kaspia, located on Place de la Madeleine in Paris's 8th arrondissement. With its distinctive aquamarine table linens, Limoges porcelain and comfortable old-world décor, the restaurant is known as a watering hole where celebrities, designers and fashion editors gather during couture and ready-to-wear fashion weeks. Rihanna stayed up until close to 4 a.m. at the restaurant to discuss her first pregnancy (after her Super Bowl performance, we now know she is into her second) with Vogue last year. Jay-Z and Beyoncé are known to pop in when they're in town. Yves Saint Laurent, Virgil Abloh and Tom Ford were frequent patrons, to name just a few of the many designers who have favored the joint. Caviar Kaspia is so beloved that people are fond of nicking the eatery's turquoise blue ashtray as a memento (which can fetch close to $ 100 on eBay).
"I love it so much. It's truly a clubhouse where I always run into people, and I swear I always have a good time," said Mel Ottenberg, the editor in chief of Interview Magazine.
"We're a bit like a traveling circus," said Ms. Santo Domingo, referring to the fashion editors and other personalities to whom she's close, a clique that includes the socialite Derek Blasberg; Vogue's global contributing fashion editor at large, Gabriella Karefa-Johnson; W's editor in chief, Sara Moonves; WSJ. Magazine's editor in chief, Kristina O'Neill; and Vogue's creative editorial director, Mark Guiducci, among others -- all of whom were in attendance that evening at the restaurant's new Upper East Side location.
"During fashion week, Caviar Kaspia is like our cafeteria," she said.
In the last three years, Caviar Kaspia has aggressively expanded internationally, first opening in Dubai just two years ago, followed by new locations in São Paulo, Saint Tropez, London and Los Angeles. New York's Caviar Kaspia came into being after the lease for the clothing and accessory brand Zadig & Voltaire's location below The Mark Hotel expired at the end of 2021. Mr. Senbahar had observed how customers at his hotel enjoyed ordering caviar, and he was a longtime fan of the original restaurant. He approached Ramon Mac-Crohon, the chief executive of Caviar Kaspia, to see if he would be interested in a partnership.
"When Izak called me, I couldn't think of a better address," said Mr. Mac-Crohon, 48, who had previously experimented with a downtown pop-up in the city in 2016. They quickly brought in the French interior decorator Jacques Grange -- responsible for the lavish look of The Mark -- to do the décor. Though that Friday evening was the first night the restaurant was opening its doors, the space wasn't finished, and a section intended to be the bar was discreetly partitioned off with black curtains, forcing cocktails to be served outside, where the paparazzi lurked nearby.
Mr. Mac-Crohon said the party should be considered a "grand soft opening."
Caviar Kaspia was founded in 1927 by the Russian émigré Arcady Fixon, who arrived in Paris after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. By then, French society had acquired a taste for the rare delicacy, which Russians had been eating for over a century. Referred to as "black gold," caviar has long been prized by conquerors and kings, czars and emperors. According to Inga Saffron's book "Caviar: The Strange History and Uncertain Future of the World's Most Coveted Delicacy," Winston Churchill requested 25 pounds of it in 1941 when he dispatched Lord Beaverbrook as a state dignitary to discuss the war with Joseph Stalin. Caviar and champagne parties were so common in the 1920s in Paris that F. Scott Fitzgerald once complained that serving it was "the height of affectation."
Caviar Kaspia is now owned by Mr. Mac-Crohon's family, who also count the restaurant Maison de la Truffe among their properties.
Decades ago, wild caviar was once so rare it could command outrageous prices. Today -- because of overfishing that has led the sturgeons of the Caspian and Black Seas to be considered an endangered species -- wild beluga caviar is banned in the United States. But the rise of farmed caviar in the last two decades has made the delicacy more available and accessible than it once was, with caviar bars popping up across the nation as well as direct-to-consumer caviar companies offering the food at more affordable prices.
Mr. Mac-Crohon said Caviar Kaspia served only farmed caviar from the United States, Bulgaria and Italy.
Still, quantity is different from quality in the universe of Caviar Kaspia. "There's one question that I hate, which journalists often ask me, which is, is caviar getting democratized? And the answer is no," Mr. Mac-Crohon said. "There are still different levels of caviar. What is happening is that caviar now has become cool. Before, caviar was for very special occasions, only for Christmas, New Year's Eve or a birthday."
Nevertheless, the food's wider availability helps to explain why his restaurant has leaned into being more of a destination than a delicacy. Whether its arrival in New York City will be a success is to be determined. But with the Parisian pastry and tea shop Ladurée now in SoHo and the Upper East Side, and the members-only London Club, Casa Cruz, having recently opened an outpost on 61st Street, it's not difficult to imagine New Yorkers embracing this new establishment as a place to celebrate.
The mayor, who said he liked attending New York Fashion Week events because it "feeds the entire economy" -- he was hoping to make it to the Michael Kors show -- was adamant that "New York City is having a comeback."
By 11 p.m., Mr. Adams had left, but the party was still thrumming along, with a handful of guests gathered around a long banquette. More vodka had been brought out by the waiters. Bowls of ice, containing open tins of caviar, sat sweating on the tables, with Caviar Kaspia's mother-of-pearl spoons casually resting nearby (metal or plastic is known to oxidize the roe). The party was winding down. Soon, the fashion set would migrate to London for the next collection of shows.
Ms. Santo Domingo said she could imagine someone having a graduation party at Caviar Kaspia. Ms. Burch and Mr. Ottenberg both said they had enjoyed going to Caviar Kaspia in Paris with their parents.
Its appeal, however, may be much more simple: "It's cozy there," Ms. Burch, 56, said.
"For when you don't have time to fly to Paris," Mr. Senbahar, 64, said. "I just thought we could bring a little bit of Paris to New York."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Other sports leagues have changed their rules to allow private equity firms to invest. But so far, the N.F.L. has resisted.
If you watch the Super Bowl on Sunday, you will probably watch it live. That's becoming increasingly rare in today's era of cord cutting, and it's one of the reasons valuations of football teams -- along with those in nearly every other sport -- have skyrocketed. With teams no longer viewed as merely trophies, the money has flowed in from investors who are rushing to own a piece of the action.
As valuations rise, more potential team buyers are being priced out. Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League have responded by changing their rules to allow private equity firms to invest. (The N.B.A. now allows sovereign wealth money, too.) The question on every sports insider's mind is when -- and if -- the National Football League will follow.
Football teams are the "Rolls-Royce of American sports leagues," said Salvatore Galatioto, whose company has advised investors on buying and selling professional sports franchises. They bring in the most money, and they have, on average, the highest valuations -- which are quickly growing, as sale prices over the past decade make clear:
Buffalo Bills (2014): $ 1.4 billion.
Carolina Panthers (2018): $ 2.22 billion.
Denver Broncos (2022): $ 4.65 billion.
The N.F.L. requires that an incoming general partner buy at least a 30 percent stake in the team. It also limits the amount of debt a buyer can use to finance the deal to $ 1 billion. That means the Washington Commanders, which hired Bank of America late last year to explore a sale, would need a buyer with about $ 1 billion in cash to match the Broncos' valuation in 2022. Given the team's popularity, and because Washington is a bigger market than Denver, any deal would very likely value the team much higher than that.
But N.F.L. owners aren't flinging open the doors. Many have passed ownership down from generation to generation. It's a close-knit bunch, and one that could be shaken by allowing institutional investors into its ownership group. "When you bring in sort of more anonymous entities, or at least ones that have larger swaths of decision makers, you create some reduction in that feel that this is an exclusive club," said Alex Michael, a managing director at LionTree. Ryan Nece, a former N.F.L. linebacker and co-founder of Next Play Capital, told DealBook that, "given my conversations with N.F.L. team owners, it doesn't appear to be something they are considering embracing today."
Closed ownership affects more than deal flow. The lack of diversity among owners, who are overwhelmingly white, has been cited as one reason for the N.F.L.'s slowness in diversifying its ranks. "Owners still look a certain way,," Richard Sherman told The New York Times in 2020 when he was a cornerback for the San Francisco 49ers. "They still come from a very old background." On the N.F.L.'s diversity issues, he said: "They could not care less."
Private equity, of course, has its own challenges with diversity, but new investors could expand the options. The N.F.L., for its part, passed a resolution in 2022 to increase diversity among its ownership. In August, three Black investors took minority stakes in the sale of the Broncos to the Walton-Penner ownership group.
There's likely only one thing that will change the N.F.L.'s mind, say investors active in sports deal making. Gerry Cardinale, the founder of RedBird Capital Partners, put it like this: "If they have to have an auction for a team, or a sale process for a team, and a Jeff Bezos or a David Tepper or a Rob Walton doesn't show up, I think they're going to have to start to look at that."
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Americans are expected to bet $ 16 billion on the game, according to the American Gaming Association. That number is in legal and illegal bets and is more than twice the value of last year's estimated wagers. It's the first time the Super Bowl will be played in a state that has legalized sports betting.
Anheuser-Busch won't be the only alcohol brand running national commercials for the first time since 1989. The parent company of Budweiser and Stella Artois still plans to air three minutes of national ads, but its competitors will also be allowed to join in Another longtime sponsorship ending this year? The halftime show, which has been sponsored by PepsiCo since 2013, is now backed by Apple Music, which signed a $ 250 million five-year deal.
Rihanna returns from a nearly four-year hiatus from live performances. The halftime show will be a high-stakes comeback for the pop star, who has been busy building three companies that helped make her the youngest self-made billionaire, according to Forbes. Her company Savage X Fenty has sold out of special edition T-shirts reading, "Rihanna Concert Interrupted by a Football Game, Weird but Whatever."
Two Black quarterbacks face off in the Super Bowl for the first time. Jalen Hurts and Patrick Mahomes, the starting quarterbacks of the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs, have both called the milestone "historic."
The pregame
For most of America, the Super Bowl starts on Sunday evening. But for the deal makers who use the event as a backdrop for doing business, the real game starts days before kickoff.
It's not uncommon to attend exclusive dinners and parties during the week, and then jet out of town before the opening kickoff. "Once the game starts, it's just a game," said George Foster, a professor at Stanford Business School who directs the school's sports management initiative. "It's much more effective to get extended time fairly focused on the business relationship on Thursday, Friday and Saturday."
Michael Rubin, the founder of the sports merchandising company Fanatics, hosted a business lunch on Friday along with the sports agent Casey Wasserman. He said about 10 of the 100 guests, who included three state governors and about half of the N.F.L.'s team owners, flew to Phoenix just for that event. "That gives you a sense of how important it was," he said. "People fly in and out just for an event."
Deal makers take advantage of having big players in one place. "There's C.E.O.-to-C.E.O. contact, which is unique in sports," said George Pyne, the founder of Bruin Capital, a sports investment company, who has hosted a party with the agent Sandy Montag before each of the past 15 Super Bowls. "The N.B.A. Finals, you never know where and when it is, so you can't go to that. Same with the N.H.L. Same with the World Series. There's no other event that galvanizes sports business leaders in a way that the Super Bowl does."
Rubin, who in addition to Friday's lunch is hosting an 800-person, invite-only party Saturday night headlined by the Chainsmokers, said his deal to sell an online services company that he founded to eBay for $ 2.4 billion in 2011 largely came together during the days before a Super Bowl game. Fanatics, he says, has also done major deals with the N.F.L. at the game. "We've done billions of dollars of business at the Super Bowl over the years," he said.
The pregame is growing. "The Super Bowl used to be a one-day event," Foster said. "Now, it's a week to two-week-long event." Even so, luxury tickets to the actual game are still in demand. Stadium suites that can accommodate 18 to 26 people for this year's game begain selling for $ 700,000 to $ 1 million, according to Suite Experiences, which allows companies with long-term suite leases to rent out their luxury boxes on the platform. "They want to watch the game for sure," Pyne said, referring to deal makers, "but they're there to conduct business."
A $ 1 billion Super Bowl?
Another Super Bowl, another record.
According to Fox, the broadcaster for Super Bowl LVII, a bidding war has pushed up the price for the game's most coveted 30-second ad slots to more than $ 7 million -- further proof that a lousy economy and a steep downturn in ad spending is no match for the big game's appeal.
Fox has raked in about $ 600 million in advertising revenue from the Super Bowl -- yep, a record -- as brands aim to reach what is likely to be the biggest TV audience of the year: an expected 100 million viewers (not a Super Bowl record). Over the past five years, the price of ads has spiked up and up, all but guaranteeing the exclusive broadcaster a lucrative payday at a time when media giants are laying off staff and cutting back on programming.
Question: How close are we to the first billion-dollar Super Bowl?
Answer: Probably 2027, according to the Kantar Group, a brand consulting and media analytics firm, which says that broadcast revenues for the event have been rising by $ 100 million each year.
Many viewers could care less about the Eagles or the Chiefs. Or the Rihanna halftime show. They want to see the buzzy ad creations that will liven up the roughly four-hour broadcast. In the YouTube era, advertisers now put the best spots online early. Here are some of DealBook's favorites:
Pop Corners. The snack food brand has reunited the Breaking Bad characters Jesse Pinkman, Walter White and Tuco in a desert standoff. What could go wrong? Crunch.
Busch Beer. OK, this one is just weird. The Canadian singer Sarah McLachlan makes a cameo with what appears to be a wolf, and other woodland creatures.
Michelob Ultra. Yes, another beer ad. Like so many Super Bowl ads this year, this one plays on our nostalgic side; it riffs on "Caddyshack." It features Serena Williams teeing off against Brian Cox of "Succession" fame. Stay for the final putt.
Sex work, sex trafficking and the Super Bowl
In December, Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, like many government officials preparing to host the Super Bowl before him, announced a statewide campaign to raise awareness of human trafficking, including sex trafficking, ahead of the big game. Though the claim that increased sex trafficking and sex work occurs during major sporting events like the Super Bowl has been debunked over and over and over and over and over again, anti-human trafficking campaigns often target these events.
Campaigns by cities have been criticized by advocates for sex workers, who say such efforts often rely on law enforcement "raids." More patrolling can lead to more arrests of sex workers who are not being trafficked, they say, as well as the possibility that victims of trafficking will be arrested.
It's also unclear whether campaigns to raise awareness about sex trafficking are effective at addressing it. "If we want to protect people who are being trafficked, we need to protect sex workers because they are the most vulnerable for that happening to them next," Kristen DiAngelo, executive director of the Sex Workers Outreach Project in Sacramento, told The Washington Post ahead of last year's Super Bowl.

Full text: The pioneer of ambient music, now 79, rediscovered some of his earliest recordings for a new four-disc set.
Laraaji, a pioneer of ambient music, barely remembers recording most of "Segue to Infinity," a four-disc trove of his early studio sessions. In the decades since he started recording, Laraaji has made dozens of albums and cassettes, both solo and collaborative. He has played concerts, festivals, webcasts, collaborations with musicians and dancers, yoga classes, meditation gatherings and more.
The collection, due Friday, reissues "Celestial Vibrations," the small-label 1978 debut album that Laraaji made under his birth name, Edward Larry Gordon, and adds six extended tracks -- each the length of an LP side -- from the same era. Its recordings were rediscovered by Jake Fischer, a college student who bought them on eBay in 2021 for $ 114.01; they were acetate recordings that had been found in a storage locker. Many tracks on "Segue to Infinity" begin with the voice of the recording engineer announcing the take, sounding fairly jaded. Then the music scintillates, dances and reverberates on its own long time frames.
"I just vaguely remember doing the recordings, and I forget who was doing the business dealings with the record at the time," Laraaji, 79, said via video chat from his apartment in Harlem. He was dressed in orange, the color he has been wearing for decades, with an orange tapestry on the wall behind him. It's the hue, he has said, of fire and transformation, of sunrise and sunset, which "drives the energy toward creativity and self-realization."
What Laraaji does remember is that the sessions were performed live in real time: "I was using loops at the time, but it was all straight in the moment." He recorded most of the music solo, but the title track is a duet with a jazz flute player, Richard Cooper, whom Laraaji has been unable to find now that their music is being released.

At the time, Laraaji was playing for passers-by in parks and on sidewalks, performing hypnotic, billowing, open-ended improvisations with mallets on an electrified zither, an autoharp without its chord bar. He discovered the instrument in a Queens pawnshop when "a mystically intimate voice" advised, "'Don't take money for the guitar,' which I was trying to pawn," he recalled. "It said, 'Swap it for that autoharp in the window."'
It was ideal for a musician drawn to bell-like, consonant sounds. "I explored the autoharp and was surprised where it took me," he said. "It gave me an instrument that I could perform from meditative states. It was exotic and it was like a miniature keyboard. It was quality controllable. It was portable. It was new. It was different."
In 1979, the British musician Brian Eno heard Laraaji in Washington Square Park, where he often performed, "sitting on the ground with his little autoharp and two little speakers," Eno recalled in a video chat from England.
Eno left Laraaji a note inviting him to record. "People are very nonchalant about something they see every day," he said. But he saw something special in the man busking in orange robes. "I thought, 'There's probably nobody in this crowd who is going to think there should be an album of this guy except me, because I'm a foreigner and I'm a stranger and it looks exotic and interesting to me."'
The album Eno produced, "Ambient 3: Day of Radiance," was Laraaji's first international release, in 1980. It is now considered a milestone of ambient and new-age music. Eno said his own role in the music was minimal. "I had a little bit of influence on some of those pieces, in that I added something to the processing of the sound," he said. "But the music was all his."
Another early Laraaji fan was Vernon Reid, the guitarist who formed the socially conscious hard-rock band Living Colour. He bought the "Celestial Vibrations" album on the street from Laraaji after hearing him play in Park Slope, and they went on to become friends.
"Laraaji was really a complete outsider," Reid recalled in a video interview. "He played this mesmerizing music and he didn't have a chip on his shoulder. He's extraordinarily consistent in all the years I've known him. He showed me that there was a way to be in the world with music that wasn't predicated on rage and wasn't predicated on material things."
"When Brian Eno encountered him, he wasn't looking for Brian Eno," Reid added. "He wasn't the one trying to impress Brian Eno. There was no construct. He's a person who was following this impulse. He just is what he is."
But that identity has evolved. Edward Larry Gordon was born in 1943 in Philadelphia and grew up in New Jersey, attending a Baptist church. (The name Laraaji has echoes of "Larry G.") "Bethlehem" -- the first track of his debut album -- was titled to commemorate the experience of being baptized when he was 12. "It was semi-traumatic and transformational. It was a very, very deep moment," Laraaji said. "You're in the water, so the best friend to you at that point is your next breath. I wanted to emulate that experience in life -- to treat others to a nonverbal baptism experience by sound."
He played violin as a child and majored in piano and composition at Howard University, but also explored acting and stand-up comedy. After college he moved to New York City, where he appeared in Greenwich Village clubs as a comedian and hosted shows at the Apollo Theater. He also had a role in the groundbreaking 1969 film "Putney Swope."
"The idea of invoking laughter has always been second nature to me," he said. "But at some point when I began exploring consciousness, cause and effect, I realized that the material I was using for comedy wasn't the most mindfully healthy thing for me to be sharing with audiences or to be conditioning myself with. So around 1970, I faded out of comedy."
He grew increasingly interested in meditation and in exploring the healing properties of sound. Then and now, he said, his music grows out of "improvisation, experimenting with electric zither and exotic open tunings, and performing from contemplative, meditative states."
Through the decades, his music has embraced advancing technology: guitar pedals, synthesizers, apps, all in the service of "adventurous sound painting," he said.
"The texture of the music is like embracing a warm, immersive, friendly, welcoming, inviting soul with a warm, fuzzy hug. Or like a nice, soothing, safe place to be vulnerable. And I think of music as inspiring movement, inspiring a body movement, inspiring a positive movement of thought and social behavior."
Laraaji has also returned to invoking laughter, but without telling jokes. Along with his concert schedule, he presents "laughter meditation" workshops, an idea he was introduced to at an ashram in New York. "The idea was to get people relaxed, chanting into their bodies and then get them to laugh for 15 minutes lying down," he said. "The workshop evolved into a play-shop, where I direct people how to laugh using the voice, into the body, into the head, to massage the head, the thyroid, the thymus in the chest, the heart, the abdominal organs, and then releasing air from the alveoli in the lungs. So it becomes a total inner workout."
The recordings that have resurfaced on "Segue to Infinity" can be simultaneously enveloping and propulsive. Some are simply named after the instruments they use: "Koto" (Japanese zither) and "Kalimba" (African thumb piano). And some derive their soothing tone, paradoxically, from nonstop motion: "Kalimba 2" is a 23-minute tour de force of sheer concentration and stamina.
"His innovation was to bring a rhythmic intensity at the same time as creating this shimmering kind of cloud," Reid said. "There's a kind of dance that's inherent in what he does, and at the same time, the celestial vibration."
Laraaji enjoys the paradox of hyperactivity bringing relaxation. "My music turns into a wafting sound or a wall of sound," he said. "I think of dance movement or Brownian motion. The idea is to move faster than the mind can track. And so the mind gives up and goes to a relaxed place and gives up its thinking function for awhile."
Hearing his old recordings may change the course of Laraaji's performances. "People come to the concerts expecting a variety of Laraaji-isms, and I tend to go to a medley of things in my live performances," he said. "I haven't done really a thing in a long form for 15 minutes' duration for a live performance, which is now something I will get back to. I respect long form. As James Brown said, 'Stay on the scene."'

NEW YORK — Laraaji, a pioneer of ambient music, barely remembers recording most of “Segue to Infinity,” a four-disc trove of his early studio sessions.

It was a very, very deep moment,” Laraaji said. “You’re in the water, so the best friend to you at that point is your next breath. I wanted to emulate that experience in life — to treat others to a nonverbal baptism experience by sound.”
He played violin as a child and majored in piano and composition at Howard University, but also explored acting and stand-up comedy. After college he moved to New York City, where he appeared in Greenwich Village clubs as a comedian and hosted shows at the Apollo Theater. He also had a role in the groundbreaking 1969 film “Putney Swope.”
“The idea of invoking laughter has always been second nature to me,” he said. “But at some point when I began exploring consciousness, cause and effect, I realized that the material I was using for comedy wasn’t the most mindfully healthy thing for me to be sharing with audiences or to be conditioning myself with. So around 1970, I faded out of comedy.”
He grew increasingly interested in meditation and in exploring the healing properties of sound. Then and now, he said, his music grows out of “improvisation, experimenting with electric zither and exotic open tunings, and performing from contemplative, meditative states.”
Through the decades, his music has embraced advancing technology: guitar pedals, synthesizers, apps, all in the service of “adventurous sound painting,” he said.
“The texture of the music is like embracing a warm, immersive, friendly, welcoming, inviting soul with a warm, fuzzy hug. Or like a nice, soothing, safe place to be vulnerable. And I think of music as inspiring movement, inspiring a body movement, inspiring a positive movement of thought and social behavior.”
Laraaji has also returned to invoking laughter, but without telling jokes. Along with his concert schedule, he presents “laughter meditation” workshops, an idea he was introduced to at an ashram in New York. “The idea was to get people relaxed, chanting into their bodies and then get them to laugh for 15 minutes lying down,” he said. “The workshop evolved into a play-shop, where I direct people how to laugh using the voice, into the body, into the head, to massage the head, the thyroid, the thymus in the chest, the heart, the abdominal organs, and then releasing air from the alveoli in the lungs. So it becomes a total inner workout.”
The recordings that have resurfaced on “Segue to Infinity” can be simultaneously enveloping and propulsive. Some are simply named after the instruments they use: “Koto” (Japanese zither) and “Kalimba” (African thumb piano). And some derive their soothing tone, paradoxically, from nonstop motion: “Kalimba 2” is a 23-minute tour de force of sheer concentration and stamina.
“His innovation was to bring a rhythmic intensity at the same time as creating this shimmering kind of cloud,” Reid said. “There’s a kind of dance that’s inherent in what he does, and at the same time, the celestial vibration.”
Laraaji enjoys the paradox of hyperactivity bringing relaxation. “My music turns into a wafting sound or a wall of sound,” he said. “I think of dance movement or Brownian motion. The idea is to move faster than the mind can track. And so the mind gives up and goes to a relaxed place and gives up its thinking function for awhile.”
Hearing his old recordings may change the course of Laraaji’s performances. “People come to the concerts expecting a variety of Laraaji-isms, and I tend to go to a medley of things in my live performances,” he said. “I haven’t done really a thing in a long form for 15 minutes’ duration for a live performance, which is now something I will get back to. I respect long form. As James Brown said, ‘Stay on the scene.’” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Harry Styles Ate Here. Fans Flock.: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At 9:30 a.m. on a Thursday, the Harrys began to arrive at Beachwood Cafe. Young women with neon hair extensions, colorful crocheted cardigans and shirts illustrated with cherries, sunflowers and the word "Pleasing" piled out of rental cars and Ubers. They were trailed by their mothers and filming on their phones. By 10:30, the mom-and pop eatery, which has been around since the 1970s in the heart of Beachwood Canyon, Los Angeles, had a 30-minute wait, and a swarm of teenage girls taking photos in front of its blue door.
Who are the Harrys? They are Harry Styles superfans, and hordes of them have been making the pilgrimage to Beachwood Cafe, a cheerful spot with an all-day menu off a small village square, since December 2019. That's when the superstar briefly name-checked the restaurant in the song "Falling": "And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe," he sang. That one line -- which Styles-olgoists believe to be about his ex Camille Rowe, a former Beachwood Canyon resident -- sent a bat signal.
"I just felt like coming here would complete the whole Harry Styles experience," said Caysey Gossweiler, 27, who traveled from Maryland to attend one of the three concerts that Mr. Styles would perform at the Kia Forum that weekend in late January.
"It's panic-inducing; I could literally evaporate thinking about it," said Noelle Jay, 26, of being in the same space where Mr. Styles once ate eggs. "He's like a god," added her cousin Mia Tucci, 17, whose hair was a shade of Kelly green. "He's like my comfort person, my light, my inspiration, all of the above," Ms. Jay replied.
Nearby, Nathan Freeman, 26, and his wife, Shannon Freeman, 25, were taking photos of Taylor Anderson and Alyson Johnston -- 20-year-old college students from Oregon they had just met. "It was like -- where should we go for breakfast? Harry told us where to go!" Mr. Freeman said gleefully.
The couple, who wore matching crop top and bell bottom ensembles to attend the concert at the Forum, had spent the previous day at Sycamore Cove Beach in Malibu, where fans say Mr. Styles filmed the videos for "Watermelon Sugar" and the One Direction song "What Makes You Beautiful."
"She ran and screamed and fan-girled," Mr. Freeman said, describing his wife's behavior upon arriving at the beach. "I was like, ah!" he shrieked. "I love this for you!"
Ms. Freeman said she admired Mr. Styles for his kindness. "I've never seen a scandal from him ever -- which is amazing."
Over avocado toast at a table inside, Ms. Anderson -- who made her family do a detour during an Amalfi Coast vacation to visit a street where Mr. Styles filmed parts of the "Golden" music video (she found the location by searching Google Maps for landmarks in the background of the behind-the-scenes video) -- offered her perspective on the fandom. "It's a family in a lot of ways," she said. "A good example of how the online world connects people."
Ms. Johnston finished watching a video on her phone of Mr. Styles doing Pilates, via the fan account Harry Florals, and added: "You can just kind of look at someone, and if they're our age and wearing clothes that resemble the Harry style it's like, OK, these are people you can talk to who are nice."
"The term is 'Harry coded,"' explained Xoee Margolis, 26, who was wearing neon orange Adidas Gazelles (inspired by ones Mr. Styles wears from the Gucci/Adidas collaboration). She held two new Beachwood Market totes in her hand, which she'd seen while browsing the cafe's merch section online from her home in New York City. "Wearing a little cherry is an ode to the 'Cherry' song, carrying around a Beachwood bag the shoes are Harry-coded -- it's a vibe."
"I made the mistake of not bringing in merch earlier," said the cafe's owner, Mike Fahim. But when he discovered eBay and Etsy accounts selling knockoff merchandise for his restaurant, he saw a business opportunity.
When Mr. Fahim took over the cafe in the fall of 2019, the crowd was a mix of locals, tourists headed to the nearby Hollywood sign, business lunches from film studios, and celebrities flying under the radar. In early 2020, the clientele started shifting to Gen Z girls and young women -- some of whom bring cardboard cutouts of Styles for photos -- and, in some cases, their parents.
Mr. Fahim, who had never heard of Harry Styles, embraced the affiliation.
Now, the tip jar says "Harry Tips Here." A sign depicted in a mural declares "The Coffee's Out," referring to the line in the song featuring Beachwood. And he and his staff are happy to take photos and answer fans' questions about what Mr. Styles is said to have eaten (the Beachwood Scramble), and where he sat (the table at the center of the room, and the booth in the far right corner). Someone on the staff monitors "the whole situation on Instagram and TikTok," Mr. Fahim said. If Mr. Styles is in town -- as he was for two weeks in the fall, when the cafe ran out of menu items and merchandise -- they double up on staff and supplies.
On the Saturday of Mr. Styles's concert run at the Forum, a line started forming outside of the cafe an hour before opening. It included Emma Szumowski, 21, from Massachusetts, who stood with her parents, Laura and Steve McMahon. The concert she'd gone to the previous evening was her sixth time seeing Mr. Styles. She had tickets for one more show in Los Angeles and two in Palm Springs that week.
"I get it, I'm a big Springsteen fan -- I started following him around in '84," said Mr. McMahon, 58, who, at his daughter's request, had gotten up early to be second in line.
The line snaked past the dry cleaners and into the square. At 8:40 a.m., Nicholas Braun, the actor who plays Cousin Greg on "Succession," joined it -- appearing slightly bewildered by the crowd -- and then left before he was seated.
Across the street, Jim Krantz, 67, and Brian Burchfield, 59, Beachwood Canyon residents, stood outside the Hollywoodland Realty building, taking in the scene.
"I mean, this was like 'Mayberry R.F.D.' -- but not anymore," said Mr. Krantz, sipping a mug of tea and referencing the 1968 spinoff of "The Andy Griffith Show" -- a sentence likely to draw a blank with the teenage girls filming their breakfast burritos across the street.
"I think it's fascinating, a social phenomenon," he added. "But it's a bit of an inconvenience when it comes to being able to do your daily life up here."
Wait times were between two and three hours throughout the weekend. At one point on Saturday, the diners inside the cafe broke out into a loud rendition of "Falling." Before the wave of Styles fans, Mr. Fahim typically served 300 guests from Friday to Sunday; he now serves 1,000 on average. The locals still come, but they often grumble about the wait times and lack of parking -- and if they see a line, they steer clear.
Most fans agreed that this was no longer a place where Mr. Styles was likely to set foot. This realization sometimes prompted fan conspiracy theories -- did he mention the cafe because he knew it would send fans flocking there, and it was too painful a place to return because of its romantic history there? But even if that were the case, "it's cool to envision him sitting in there being all sad and lonely," said Bryn Langrock, 23.
And if Mr. Styles did dine at Beachwood Cafe again, Mr. Fahim says he knows what he'd tell him: "Thank you."

Laraaji Conjures a Baptism in Sound

NEW YORK — Laraaji, a pioneer of ambient music, barely remembers recording most of “Segue to Infinity,” a four-disc trove of his early studio sessions. In the decades since he started recording, Laraaji has made dozens of albums and cassettes, both solo and collaborative. He has played concerts, festivals, webcasts, collaborations with musicians and dancers, yoga classes, meditation gatherings and more.
The collection, due Friday, reissues “Celestial Vibrations,” the small-label 1978 debut album that Laraaji made under his birth name, Edward Larry Gordon, and adds six extended tracks — each the length of an LP side — from the same era. Its recordings were rediscovered by Jake Fischer, a college student who bought them on eBay in 2021 for $114.01; they were acetate recordings that had been found in a storage locker. Many tracks on “Segue to Infinity” begin with the voice of the recording engineer announcing the take, sounding fairly jaded. Then the music scintillates, dances and reverberates on its own long time frames.
“I just vaguely remember doing the recordings, and I forget who was doing the business dealings with the record at the time,” Laraaji, 79, said via video chat from his apartment in Harlem. He was dressed in orange, the color he has been wearing for decades, with an orange tapestry on the wall behind him. It’s the hue, he has said, of fire and transformation, of sunrise and sunset, which “drives the energy toward creativity and self-realization.”
What Laraaji does remember is that the sessions were performed live in real time: “I was using loops at the time, but it was all straight in the moment.” He recorded most of the music solo, but the title track is a duet with a jazz flute player, Richard Cooper, whom Laraaji has been unable to find now that their music is being released.
At the time, Laraaji was playing for passersby in parks and on sidewalks, performing hypnotic, billowing, open-ended improvisations with mallets on an electrified zither, an autoharp without its chord bar. He discovered the instrument in a Queens pawnshop when “a mystically intimate voice” advised, “‘Don’t take money for the guitar,’ which I was trying to pawn,” he recalled. “It said, ‘Swap it for that autoharp in the window.’”
It was ideal for a musician drawn to bell-like, consonant sounds. “I explored the autoharp and was surprised where it took me,” he said. “It gave me an instrument that I could perform from meditative states. It was exotic and it was like a miniature keyboard. It was quality controllable. It was portable. It was new. It was different.”
In 1979, British musician Brian Eno heard Laraaji in Washington Square Park, where he often performed, “sitting on the ground with his little autoharp and two little speakers,” Eno recalled in a video chat from England.
Eno left Laraaji a note inviting him to record. “People are very nonchalant about something they see every day,” he said. But he saw something special in the man busking in orange robes. “I thought, ‘There’s probably nobody in this crowd who is going to think there should be an album of this guy except me, because I’m a foreigner and I’m a stranger and it looks exotic and interesting to me.’”
The album Eno produced, “Ambient 3: Day of Radiance,” was Laraaji’s first international release, in 1980. It is now considered a milestone of ambient and new-age music. Eno said his own role in the music was minimal. “I had a little bit of influence on some of those pieces, in that I added something to the processing of the sound,” he said. “But the music was all his.”
Another early Laraaji fan was Vernon Reid, the guitarist who formed the socially conscious hard-rock band Living Colour. He bought the “Celestial Vibrations” album on the street from Laraaji after hearing him play in Park Slope, and they went on to become friends.
“Laraaji was really a complete outsider,” Reid recalled in a video interview. “He played this mesmerizing music and he didn’t have a chip on his shoulder. He’s extraordinarily consistent in all the years I’ve known him. He showed me that there was a way to be in the world with music that wasn’t predicated on rage and wasn’t predicated on material things.”
“When Brian Eno encountered him, he wasn’t looking for Brian Eno,” Reid added. “He wasn’t the one trying to impress Brian Eno. There was no construct. He’s a person who was following this impulse. He just is what he is.”
But that identity has evolved. Edward Larry Gordon was born in 1943 in Philadelphia and grew up in New Jersey, attending a Baptist church. (The name Laraaji has echoes of “Larry G.”) “Bethlehem” — the first track of his debut album — was titled to commemorate the experience of being baptized when he was 12. “It was semi-traumatic and transformational. It was a very, very deep moment,” Laraaji said. “You’re in the water, so the best friend to you at that point is your next breath.

Where Rap Gods Get Their Bling: [Style Desk]

Full text: The jewelry designer Alex Moss specializes in creating custom pieces for clients like Drake and Jack Harlow. This month, he releases a collection available to the masses.
Nine floors above the storefronts of New York's diamond district, in a corner suite of the World Diamond Tower, a lariat necklace with diamonds the size of molars sat inside a silver briefcase. The necklace was fresh from a cleaning -- an ultrasonic water bath, followed by a steam -- and visiting the office of the jewelry designer Alex Moss in late January en route to its owner: the rapper and singer Drake.
"Jewelry is like a car, it needs to be maintained," Mr. Moss, 30, said.
The piece, created by Mr. Moss, took 14 months to make. A video shared on Instagram by the designer said that its 42 diamonds represented the number of times that Drake had considered proposing marriage. When asked how much the necklace cost, Mr. Moss declined to answer, citing the security of its owner.
Personal orders like Drake's necklace have been Mr. Moss's bread and butter since he started his namesake line in 2020. Last year, he created about 170 custom pieces, he said, and is currently juggling about 40. Much of that jewelry has been made for young hip-hop artists: His other clients have included include Tyler, the Creator, ASAP Rocky and Chief Keef. Some of the pieces have had price tags with six figures, including a belt set with rubies and white, black and green diamonds for ASAP Rocky, and a diamond-and-sapphire-encrusted bellhop chain for Tyler, the Creator.
"The artists I look up to went to the Ben Ballers, to the Jacobs, to the Lorraines," said Tyler, the Creator, referring to the jewelry designers Ben Yang, Jacob Arabo (a.k.a. Jacob the Jeweler) and Lorraine Schwartz, all of whom have been recognized for blinging out hip-hop stars. "Now we have Alex Moss."
'I Can Do This'
This month, Mr. Moss is expanding his business with the introduction of a new collection of ready-made jewelry sold on his website. Starting at about $ 1,000, the pieces are by no means cheap, but they cost less than his custom designs. "There is a huge range," he said.
The collection, called "Cathedral of Dreams," borrows heavily from Christian and gothic imagery. There are pieces shaped like crosses, crucifixes, angels and the face of Jesus wearing a diamond-studded crown of thorns. "I've always loved the aesthetic," said Mr. Moss, who was raised in the Armenian Orthodox Church.
"I'm faithful," added Mr. Moss, who was puffing on a strawberry kiwi vape and wearing three of his line's chain necklaces, as well as a tongue-shaped "Lick of Death" ring from his new collection. "But I am not the most religious person."
Mr. Moss, who is from a suburb of Toronto, said he was obsessed with "Star Wars" and downloading hip-hop music from the Napster successor Kazaa when he was growing up. As a tween, he nurtured his creativity through Adobe Photoshop, which he learned to master himself. Using money he had saved, some made from reselling sneakers on eBay, he started a streetwear line called Bandit in his senior year of high school, before dropping out. A self-described "troublemaker," Mr. Moss then had jobs as a waiter, a paralegal assistant and at a Bed Bath & Beyond store while working on his streetwear line.
In 2016, after earning his high school equivalency diploma in Canada, he moved to New York at 25 to study fashion at Parsons School of Design.
"It wasn't a typical path," said Mr. Moss, who is 6 foot 5 inches and has wavy shoulder-length black hair and a black goatee. "Me being 25 and all of these kids are 18."
While at Parsons, he got an internship at the jeweler Avianne & Co. in Midtown. (Its office is a few doors down from Mr. Moss's suite in the World Diamond Tower.) He developed an interest in jewelry through his love of hip-hop, he said, and as an intern, he would help design custom pieces.
"I was like OK, I'm actually sick. I can do this," Mr. Moss said. Eventually, he dropped out of Parsons to work on custom design projects at Avianne & Co.
He had already worked on some personal orders for hip-hop artists by the time the rapper Playboi Carti introduced him to ASAP Rocky while the men were in Paris for Virgil Abloh's debut men's wear show for Louis Vuitton in 2018. "I thought he was a rapper the first time we met," ASAP Rocky said. Of Mr. Moss's jewelry, he added: "It's less about the flex than the artistic value."
When Mr. Moss started his namesake line in 2020, he was working from his apartment in the Long Island City section of Queens. At the time, he had saved enough money to cover rent and living expenses for a couple of months, he said. Two weeks later, New York implemented its pandemic lockdown.
"Who was going to buy jewelry?" Mr. Moss recalled thinking at the time. "No one even knew where we were getting food from."
Early six-figure custom orders, including from the rapper Jack Harlow and the music producer Rvssian, kept his business afloat, he said, and enabled him to set up shop at his diamond district location.
A Desire to Be Attainable
From Mr. Moss's office overlooking 47th Street, the glimmering red lights of Times Square look a bit like shimmering Burmese rubies. Inside, there are rocks both real (diamonds in jewelry display cases, green marble on walls) and fake (in one nook, walls were treated to look like a cavern, or "diamond cave," as Mr. Moss called it).
In another corner are a Pac-Man arcade game and a vending machine that Mr. Moss hopes to one day fill with branded trinkets. "Key chains, ashtrays, things you can only get here," he said.
His office and showroom are a few floors above the factory where his line's pieces are made, a space that Mr. Moss had previously used as his first office in the World Diamond Tower. ("He's moving on up, like George Jefferson," as ASAP Rocky put it.) The factory is made up of two lab-like rooms where a head jeweler oversees a team of three diamond setters as they place stones and laser precious metals.
Mr. Moss, who employs 15 people, is quick to point out that the artisans in the factory are the "jewelers" who construct his pieces, and that he is the "jewelry designer" who conceives them. "I'm like Ralph Lifshitz," Mr. Moss said, referring to the founder of Ralph Lauren, who built an empire not on sewing expertise, but on creative vision.
In discussing the future of his company, Mr. Moss mentioned aspirations for it to follow the trajectory of Chrome Hearts, which over the years has evolved from a niche line to a lifestyle brand, in part because famous musical artists (Cher) and models (Bella Hadid) have helped popularize its silver jewelry, hoodies and T-shirts.
"Chrome Hearts is attainable," Mr. Moss said. "That is the direction we are going in."
He is working on renderings for a watch he hopes to start producing in partnership with a watchmaker in the coming years. Though Mr. Moss has customized vintage Cartier and Rolex watches -- a process he calls "Frankensteining" -- he has yet to design his own timepieces.
He also wants to open a flagship store and showroom in SoHo. Though his business has flourished in the diamond district, there are associations with the neighborhood that could become limitations to additional growth, Mr. Moss said.
"A lot of jewelers in our space, they are like Chris the Jeweler, Jacob the Jeweler," he said. "I'm not Alex the Jeweler. We are Alex Moss New York."

Harry Styles Ate Here. His Fans Will Now Eat Here Forever.

At 9:30 a.m. on a Thursday, the Harrys began to arrive at Beachwood Cafe. Young women with neon hair extensions, colorful crocheted cardigans and shirts illustrated with cherries, sunflowers and the word “Pleasing” piled out of rental cars and Ubers. They were trailed by their mothers and filming on their phones. By 10:30, the mom-and pop eatery, which has been around since the 1970s in the heart of Los Angeles’ Beachwood Canyon, had a 30-minute wait, and a swarm of teenage girls taking photos in front of its blue door.
Who are the Harrys? They are Harry Styles superfans, and hordes of them have been making the pilgrimage to Beachwood Cafe, a cheerful spot with an all-day menu off a small village square, since December 2019. That’s when the superstar briefly name-checked the restaurant in the song “Falling”: “And the coffee’s out at the Beachwood Cafe,” he sang. That one line — which Styles-olgoists believe to be about his ex Camille Rowe, a former Beachwood Canyon resident — sent a bat signal.
“I just felt like coming here would complete the whole Harry Styles experience,” said Caysey Gossweiler, 27, who traveled from Maryland to attend one of the three concerts that Styles would perform at the Kia Forum that weekend in late January.
“It’s panic-inducing; I could literally evaporate thinking about it,” said Noelle Jay, 26, of being in the same space where Styles once ate eggs. “He’s like a god,” added her cousin Mia Tucci, 17, whose hair was a shade of Kelly green. “He’s like my comfort person, my light, my inspiration, all of the above,” Jay replied.
Nearby, Nathan Freeman, 26, and his wife, Shannon Freeman, 25, were taking photos of Taylor Anderson and Alyson Johnston — 20-year-old college students from Oregon they had just met. “It was like — where should we go for breakfast? Harry told us where to go!” Nathan Freeman said gleefully.
The couple, who wore matching crop top and bell bottom ensembles to attend the concert at the Forum, had spent the previous day at Sycamore Cove Beach in Malibu, where fans say Styles filmed the videos for “Watermelon Sugar” and the One Direction song “What Makes You Beautiful.”
“She ran and screamed and fan-girled,” Nathan Freeman said, describing his wife’s behavior upon arriving at the beach. “I was like, ah!” he shrieked. “I love this for you!”
Shannon Freeman said she admired Styles for his kindness. “I’ve never seen a scandal from him ever — which is amazing.”
Over avocado toast at a table inside, Anderson — who made her family do a detour during an Amalfi Coast vacation to visit a street where Styles filmed parts of the “Golden” music video (she found the location by searching Google Maps for landmarks in the background of the behind-the-scenes video) — offered her perspective on the fandom. “It’s a family in a lot of ways,” she said. “A good example of how the online world connects people.”
Johnston finished watching a video on her phone of Styles doing Pilates, via the fan account Harry Florals, and added: “You can just kind of look at someone, and if they’re our age and wearing clothes that resemble the Harry style it’s like, OK, these are people you can talk to who are nice.”
“The term is ‘Harry coded,’” explained Xoee Margolis, 26, who was wearing neon orange Adidas Gazelles (inspired by ones Styles wears from the Gucci/Adidas collaboration). She held two new Beachwood Market totes in her hand, which she’d seen while browsing the cafe’s merchandise section online from her home in New York City. “Wearing a little cherry is an ode to the ‘Cherry’ song, carrying around a Beachwood bag the shoes are Harry-coded — it’s a vibe.”
“I made the mistake of not bringing in merch earlier,” said the cafe’s owner, Mike Fahim. But when he discovered eBay and Etsy accounts selling knockoff merchandise for his restaurant, he saw a business opportunity.
When Fahim took over the cafe in fall 2019, the crowd was a mix of locals, tourists headed to the nearby Hollywood sign, business lunches from film studios, and celebrities flying under the radar. In early 2020, the clientele started shifting to Gen Z girls and young women — some of whom bring cardboard cutouts of Styles for photos — and, in some cases, their parents.
Fahim, who had never heard of Styles, embraced the affiliation.
Now, the tip jar says “Harry Tips Here.” A sign depicted in a mural declares “The Coffee’s Out,” referring to the line in the song featuring Beachwood. And he and his staff are happy to take photos and answer fans’ questions about what Styles is said to have eaten (the Beachwood Scramble), and where he sat (the table at the center of the room, and the booth in the far right corner). Someone on the staff monitors “the whole situation on Instagram and TikTok,” Fahim said. If Styles is in town — as he was for two weeks in the fall, when the cafe ran out of menu items and merchandise — they double up on staff and supplies.
On the Saturday of Styles’ concert run at the Forum, a line started forming outside the cafe an hour before opening. It included Emma Szumowski, 21, from Massachusetts, who stood with her parents, Laura and Steve McMahon. The concert she’d gone to the previous evening was her sixth time seeing Styles. She had tickets for one more show in Los Angeles and two in Palm Springs that week.
“I get it, I’m a big Springsteen fan — I started following him around in ’84,” said Steve McMahon, 58, who, at his daughter’s request, had gotten up early to be second in line.
The line snaked past the dry cleaners and into the square. At 8:40 a.m., Nicholas Braun, an actor who plays Cousin Greg on “Succession,” joined it — appearing slightly bewildered by the crowd — and then left before he was seated.
Across the street, Jim Krantz, 67, and Brian Burchfield, 59, Beachwood Canyon residents, stood outside the Hollywoodland Realty building, taking in the scene.
“I mean, this was like ‘Mayberry R.F.D.’ — but not anymore,” said Krantz, sipping a mug of tea and referencing the 1968 spinoff of “The Andy Griffith Show” — a sentence likely to draw a blank with the teenage girls filming their breakfast burritos across the street.
“I think it’s fascinating, a social phenomenon,” he added. “But it’s a bit of an inconvenience when it comes to being able to do your daily life up here.”
Wait times were between two and three hours throughout the weekend. At one point Saturday, the diners inside the cafe broke out into a loud rendition of “Falling.” Before the wave of Styles fans, Fahim typically served 300 guests from Friday to Sunday; he now serves 1,000 on average. The locals still come, but they often grumble about the wait times and lack of parking — and if they see a line, they steer clear.
Most fans agreed that this was no longer a place where Styles was likely to set foot. This realization sometimes prompted fan conspiracy theories — did he mention the cafe because he knew it would send fans flocking there, and it was too painful a place to return because of its romantic history there? But even if that were the case, “it’s cool to envision him sitting in there being all sad and lonely,” said Bryn Langrock, 23.
And if Styles did dine at Beachwood Cafe again, Fahim says he knows what he’d tell him: “Thank you.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Splash Mountain Closes, And Now the Ride's Fans Are Selling the Water: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Jars and bags of what sellers claim is water from the popular Florida attraction are being offered for sale online. The odd farewell comes as Disney takes steps to erase the ride's racist back story.
Splash Mountain has been one of the most popular attractions at Walt Disney World for 30 years. So when the log flume ride closed for good on Sunday, instead of saying goodbye, some Disney fans found themselves wrestling with a deeply consequential question: How much would someone pay for a baggie of Splash Mountain water?
After many fans lined up for hours over the weekend in the park near Orlando, Fla., for one last five-story plunge down the mountain, eBay sellers began listing what they claimed to be small amounts of the ride's 950,000 gallons of water.
The prices ranged from $ 8.50 to $ 25 for a plastic bag with "Splash Mountain water" written on it in thick, black marker, and hand-drawn water droplets added for emphasis.
One listing showed a reusable bottle that purportedly contained 10 ounces from the ride's last day for $ 7.99. Another seller advertised four ounces of water in a Mason jar for $ 149.95.
The outpouring by fans comes as Disney takes steps to erase the ride's racist back story, drawn from the 1946 musical film "Song of the South," which the company has not made available in any form for more than 35 years.
When the ride reopens next year, Br'er Rabbit and other animatronic characters from that film will be gone, replaced by characters and themes from the 2009 Disney movie "The Princess and the Frog." It will be renamed Tiana's Bayou Adventure. A similar plan is in place for the Splash Mountain ride at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., although it remains open for now.
Adrian Vasquez, 28, who has ridden Splash Mountain more than 200 times, said he was not the least bit surprised when he saw the eBay listings.
"The Disney community can be very weird sometimes," said Mr. Vasquez, 28, who noted that he did not take any mementos after his final ride on Sunday night. "I honestly don't know how else to put it."
Disney announced the planned changes in 2020 during the national reckoning on racial justice sparked by the murder of George Floyd.
"Song of the South," which was set on a Georgia plantation after the Civil War, mixed live-action filmmaking and animation in a way that was groundbreaking for the time, and it won an Oscar for the song "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah."
But critics have long objected that the film, based on the books of Joel Chandler Harris, a white folklorist who collected traditional African American tales and attributed them to the fictional Uncle Remus, romanticized slavery and promoted racist stereotypes.
Bob Iger, Disney's chief executive, said in 2020 that the movie would never appear on Disney+, the company's streaming platform, because it "was just not appropriate in today's world."
When the rides reopen in the parks next year, visitors will encounter Princess Tiana, Disney's first Black princess, and Louis the alligator as they prepare for their first-ever Mardi Gras performance. "The new concept is inclusive," Disney said in 2020. "It speaks to the diversity of the millions of people who visit our parks each year."
In the meantime, it's buyer beware time for fans of the original ride.
Phillip Halfacre, 42, of Fayetteville, Ark., saw social media posts about the eBay listings for Splash Mountain water and wanted in.
A self-described "huge Disney fan" and collector, Mr. Halfacre took a plastic bag with the Splash Mountain logo from one of his visits to Disney World a few years back (the bags are handed out to keep valuables dry), filled it with tap water and listed it on the auction site for $ 25,000.
Nearly 10,000 people viewed his listing before eBay took it down, Mr. Halfacre said.
"It was not meant as a rude gesture or even a rude gesture to Disney, I love Disney," he said, having ridden Splash Mountain 20 times. "It was something to make everybody's Monday brighter."
Despite the transparent nature of his prank, Mr. Halfacre said he still received two or three serious offers asking him to verify that the water had come from Splash Mountain.
"Disney is magical to each of us in its own way," he said. "That water may mean something to someone more than somebody else, even if in reality it's the same water they're going to get out of the water fountain."
A native of Central Florida who now lives in Tampa, Mr. Vasquez said that he grew up going to to the park and that Splash Mountain was his first "big-kids ride." He even worked there in 2015 while he was in college.
"Even my trainers said the source material was racist," he said. "It's fitting that an attraction that is based on a film that negatively depicts people of color be replaced by Disney's first African American princess. This move will go a long way for many Disney fans of color who have been looking for more representation in the parks."
He said he expected the new ride will offer the same thrills, but he wanted to say goodbye to the original on closing day.
And so on Sunday morning, Mr. Vasquez arrived 45 minutes before the 9 a.m. "rope drop," when the park opens to the public, and then joined what he described as the "Splash Mountain 5K" -- a throng of people running to line up for a final ride.
Some visitors spent five hours in line, standing shoulder to shoulder as far as the eye could see, according to The Orlando Sentinel. A cheering section of fans chanted "Splash! Splash! Splash!" when the logs made their signature drop. Disney staff members took the closing ride and were met with applause from adoring fans.
"There was some sadness but there was just a sense of celebration in the air," Mr. Vasquez said. He said he took three rides on Sunday, including one with his mother.
"It was a little sad but just a lot of fun," he said.

A Performer Eager To Be Inspired: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Hip-hop can sometimes discourage rappers from openly embracing their heroes, but Drake wears his enthusiasms loudly and, this past week, literally.
There's an internet-famous photo of Cam'ron wearing a pink mink jacket with a matching headband, holding a pink flip phone to his ear. It was taken at a Baby Phat fashion show in 2003, when the Harlem rapper was in his peak peacock era -- a hardrock dandy oozing loucheness and insouciance, blending an aura of toughness with devil-may-care liberation.
Drake was 16 when that future meme hit the internet, a Canadian teen actor with rap star dreams. He hadn't yet formed the aesthetic identity that would make him the most influential hip-hop performer of the past decade. He was, first and foremost, a fan.
He still is. At the Apollo Theater on Saturday night, at the first of two shows he performed for SiriusXM subscribers, he brought out Cam'ron and the Diplomats for a guest set. For that part of the show, Drake wore Cam'ron's pink mink jacket and headband -- the actual garments. This was something more than homage, and also something more than mere enthusiasm. This was Drake making an in-joke to the hip-hop internet of the early to mid-2000s, while acknowledging how fans of all stripes would love to briefly inhabit the skin of their heroes. Given the unique opportunity, Drake chose to become the meme.
Drake is a social media sophisticate, a fine walker of the almost completely obliterated line between fandom and creation. No contemporary pop star has so effectively weaponized the ways in which boosterism and distaste coexist in online spaces. Drake may be the most popular musician whose fans are not an organized troop, like the Swifties or the BeyHive -- that's because Drake fandom is more interactive. Even his biggest detractors turn their contempt into shareable bites, and Drake reacts to that dismissal with cool élan, incorporating it into his narrative when it serves him.
To be a fan in this era is to effectively write yourself into your idol's story, or to make your idol's art somehow about you. And to be a truly modern celebrity is to acknowledge the ways in which you are being consumed, positive and negative alike, and feed those mouths accordingly.
This past week, Drake played with that fire twice. His Apollo concert was mostly a hits and B-sides revue. But he animatedly and joyously danced and rapped along while the Diplomats performed "I Really Mean It," "Dipset Anthem" and Jim Jones's "We Fly High," a literal display of how fandom has shaped his own career arc. A few days earlier, he demonstrated the same point in more ostentatious fashion. In the newly released video for "Jumbotron ___ Poppin," a song from his 2022 collaborative album with 21 Savage, Drake wore several iconic pieces of jewelry custom-made for Pharrell Williams and recently sold by Joopiter, an auction platform founded by Williams.
Drake spent around $ 2.7 million on the items, including the signature 2005 N.E.R.D chain with pastel links created by Jacob & Co., a yellow gold diamond-encrusted dual skateboard pendant chain (also by Jacob & Co.) and a 14-karat yellow gold Sony PSP.
There is an additional layer of subtext here. In a 2010 episode of the MTV show "When I Was 17," Drake revealed that, as a teenager, he bought a microphone purportedly signed by Pusha T on eBay. At that time, Drake was a committed fan of Clipse, the duo of Pusha T and his brother Malice. (Williams, as part of the production duo the Neptunes, helped usher Clipse into the world.)
But in later years, Pusha T became Drake's primary antagonist, revealing via a song that Drake had fathered a son, and also standing fast with Kanye West during the Kanye-Drake cold war (until recently, of course). On the MTV show, Drake said he used the mic so much as a teenager that the autograph wore off (and conceded that it might not have even been real). But in an interview with Rap Radar in 2019, he said that he still owned the mic. It had ceased to be Pusha T's; it had become his own.
That Drake has never been shy about how he soaks up influence sets him apart from most of his peers. (It is something he shares with West, his primary idol turned rival.) He's long been an enthusiastic booster of younger artists working in new styles, and speaks openly of how his elders shaped him.
In hip-hop, where even covering another rapper's song is considered heresy, this kind of naked fandom is often discouraged. And as might be expected, Drake's sartorial love notes this past week resulted in a new raft of memes speculating about what other sorts of accoutrements he might buy in order to insert himself into key moments in hip-hop history: the paper towel bandanna from Jadakiss's "Knock Yourself Out" video, the gun used by Shyne in the 1999 Club New York shooting.
But being a fan of Drake means, in some way, accepting that identity is constructed by trying on pre-existing ones and seeing what fits. Embedded in the act of putting on the coat or the necklace is the knowledge that it eventually comes off -- that's when you learn who you've become.

Philippine Court Acquits Nobel Laureate: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The verdict was a rare legal victory for Ms. Ressa, founder of the news site Rappler, who has been under pressure from the Philippine authorities for years.
MANILA -- The journalist and Nobel laureate Maria Ressa was acquitted of tax evasion on Wednesday, a rare victory after numerous setbacks in her fight to keep publishing her news site Rappler, whose run-ins with the authorities have become emblematic of the Philippines' declining press freedoms.
A Philippine court acquitted Ms. Ressa on all four charges against her. She would have faced a maximum sentence of 34 years if convicted. Rappler had also faced four charges and was acquitted.
Outside the courthouse in Manila, the capital, Ms. Ressa was visibly relieved and emotional after the verdict. Asked what it meant to her, she replied: "Hope. That is what it provides."
"We need independent media to hold power to account," she added.
The case was the first high-profile test of whether the legal troubles facing Ms. Ressa and Rappler would continue under the Philippines' new president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has benefited from online disinformation and tried to play down the brutality of his father's dictatorship decades ago. Advocates had urged Mr. Marcos to demonstrate his stated commitment to a free press by intervening in Ms. Ressa's favor.
The authorities began taking action against Ms. Ressa and Rappler during the administration of Mr. Marcos's predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, as the news organization was aggressively covering Mr. Duterte's bloody campaign against drugs. That coverage helped Ms. Ressa win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021.
There are several other cases pending against Ms. Ressa, an outspoken critic of both presidents, and her news site. She is appealing her June 2020 conviction on a cyber libel charge, under which she could face six years in prison. The Philippines' top court is expected to rule on that case soon.
It was not immediately clear on Wednesday whether the verdict in the tax case would influence the government's prosecution of the other cases, or the eventual verdicts. Rappler reported on Wednesday that the verdict would likely affect a pending case in a regional court in Pasig City, where it said the facts in the case were "identical" to the charges that the Manila court threw out.
Chel Diokno, a well-known Filipino human rights lawyer and chairman of the Free Legal Assistance Group, said he saw the verdict Wednesday as a good sign. "I hope that Maria's other cases are decided with the same judicial independence and adherence to the rule of law," he said.
Mr. Marcos, who took office in June with Mr. Duterte's daughter Sara as vice president, has sent mixed signals about the extent to which he differs from his predecessor. He recently rejected a request from the International Criminal Court to resume its inquiry into Mr. Duterte's antidrug campaign, which left thousands of people dead.
But Mr. Marcos has also declined to attack the country's mainstream media, as Mr. Duterte did, and he has generally taken a less disruptive approach to the presidency -- for example, by drawing his country closer to the United States, the Philippines' longtime military ally.
Mr. Marcos is in Davos, Switzerland, this week for the World Economic Forum. A conviction of Ms. Ressa in the Philippines would likely have exposed him to unwanted scrutiny.
In a recent letter to Mr. Marcos, a group of Nobel Peace Prize laureates implored him to "assist in bringing about a rapid resolution to the unjust charges against Maria Ressa and Rappler."
"We hope to see the Philippines leave the mistakes of its past behind," they wrote.
The tax evasion case was related to an investment into Rappler by Omidyar Network, which is owned by the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. The authorities said the financing violated the restrictions on foreign ownership of domestic media. Rappler countered that Mr. Omidyar's investment was not the same as owning shares, did not violate the law and did not give Omidyar Network control of its operations.
Rappler continued to publish while it fought its legal battles, and in 2018 the Omidyar Network donated its investment to Rappler employees, which the publication argued should have ended the government's grievance. However, the authorities then accused Rappler of owing taxes on that transaction.
In a statement, Rappler described the verdict Wednesday as "the triumph of facts over politics." The news outlet said it did not believe the tax charges against Ms. Ressa had "any basis in fact."
Glenda M. Gloria, Rappler's executive editor, said in an interview that she saw the verdict as a significant victory for her organization, the Philippine media and businesses generally.
"It sends a good signal to the business community that the court of tax appeals sided with justice," she said.
Ms. Ressa was convicted of cyber libel in connection with an article that Rappler published four months before the law under which she was charged took effect. An appeals court has said that the case should not be considered a press freedom issue, stressing that the law was "not geared towards the curtailment of speech."

A Winter Coat That's All Potential: [Style Desk]

Full text: Supervising the search for the dream coat.
People get so dreary with their wool coats, like they're just workhorses. Wearing the same boring coat over and over for months -- months!!!!! -- just for warmth is an expression of defeat. After all, it's pretty much all anyone will see of you on the street for a while. Don't let the cold weather or seasonal affective disorder win.
What if your winter coat wasn't a workhorse but a show pony? What if the warmth it gave you was via super-luxurious fabric that swaddled you? What if it was a color other than black, navy or camel so the guy you see when you walk your dog refers to you as "that woman in the yellow coat"? What if a winter coat was about potential?
Vintage is a great move. Search Etsy or the RealReal (or the Gem app, which searches those places, along with sites like eBay, Grailed, Poshmark, Vestiaire Collective, even LiveAuctioneers), for one of the Phoebe Philo-era Céline llama wool coats (think 2015 to 2018 or so), buy it and worry about the price later. While you're looking for llama, try other fabrics like cashmere or, even better, vicuña.
It's probably a good idea to order coats that are returnable. Fit is certainly a consideration, but so is smell. Coats absorb odor, and even though dryer sheets and a fan can do a lot, it can't do much for the most perfect cashmere Bonwit Teller coat that has been in the home of a chain smoker since the 1970s.
I talked a friend out of an overpriced but low-quality coat from a mid-tier French brand and told her to search for vintage MaxMara or Jil Sander or the Row coats and to text me the results because I love supervising a shopping quest and I love being bossy. It worked. She's now the proud owner of an espresso brown cashmere coat that was about a quarter of what she was going to pay.
Here is what my dream coat wardrobe would be, each one a lesson in a winter well lived.
MaxMara
Can you even talk about fancy winter coats without talking about MaxMara? The brand has a few styles it does every year. The 101801 is the double-breasted coat, the Manuela is a wrap coat, but the one I have my eye on is the Ludmilla, which is the wrap coat with an A-line silhouette. The fullness at the bottom is reminiscent of the 1950s and feels a little optimistic. It comes in black and, even better, tobacco brown. But what if you got it in the bright cornflower blue cashmere? It would look good with pretty much anything (black, navy, brown, green, pink, yellow), I promise. ( $ 6,590)
Hermès
On Christmas Eve I ended up at the Hermès boutique in the meatpacking district, dropping off a repair. But while I was in store, I drank the free water I was given and went upstairs, where I zeroed in on this wrap coat in double-sided baby cashmere that's a shade somewhere between oatmeal and ivory. I spent a solid five minutes petting and photographing it. There's a small ring on one of the front pockets that you could attach your keys to. Would that be weird? I guess if you're walking around town in an Hermès coat, get as weird as you want. ( $ 8,050)
Alaïa
I have two different friends on the hunt for oversize, super-luxe peacoats. This Alaïa one has shape. In the front, it's business: just below the knees, big collar, vinyl-covered buttons. But it's a party in back with a low martingale (a sort of strap) that gives it a gathered look. It also comes in a two-button version that hits at the hips for a more classic peacoat shape. Why decide? I'll take both. ( $ 5,050)
Loro Piana
I will not entertain queries about the practicality of white coats. If you live in a world where you buy five-figure coats, practicality should not be your concern, either. I think there's a certain point in one's fashion journey where you get really into legacy Italian brands. MaxMara may be the gateway drug, but the end point is a label like Brunello Cucinelli or Loro Piana. This coat is a silk and cashmere blend that looks almost like a tweed. If you put it on, you'll look like a Hitchcock heroine, even if you're wearing sweatpants underneath. ( $ 10,125)
Kallmeyer
The scarf coat is a whole thing this year. I don't mean that disparagingly, just that there are a lot of potentially good ones to sort through. Toteme has a version, Tove has a version, but my favorite is from the New York label Kallmeyer. It's made in a cashmere-wool blend and -- this is crucial -- the attached scarf is detachable, giving you a lot of options. I would wear the scarf as a giant head wrap with a down jacket and leather pants in 18-degree weather, or wear the coats sans scarf and open with the vintage black Levi's 501s I just got on Etsy and my black Lucchese cowboy boots in 50-degree weather. ( $ 1,575)
Massimo Alba
Once, because of a canceled connecting flight, I had an unexpected afternoon in Rome. I decided I wanted to go to the Massimo Alba store. I went on foot, got totally lost, ate a mortadella sandwich and came upon the boutique only to find it closed. I think the lesson was something about the journey being the destination.
Tailored, men's-wear-inspired coats are everywhere right now, but I like Massimo Alba's Praga coat in navy the best. It has dropped shoulders that soften the look a bit. And while I'm talking about softness, coats are not costumes. I see women all over my Instagram feed wearing their tailored coats with trousers and silk tops as if they're playacting at being career women from a 1990s movie. Don't do that. Wear it with whatever you normally wear. Wear it over Julia Heuer pants! ( $ 2,635, on sale for $ 1,581)

The Push for Sustainability: [Series]

Full text: This article is part of a series examining Responsible Fashion , and innovative efforts to address issues facing the fashion industry.
Who gets to decide what is green or greenwashing? Is it a good thing that more celebrities and reality stars are embracing pre-loved clothing? How much should governments step in when it comes to sustainability? What protections do garment workers have?
These are just some of the questions that dominated the debate in 2022 about how the fashion industry can reduce its impact on the planet and safeguard its hundreds of thousands of workers in poor countries.
Going into 2023, there are soaring energy prices in Europe, global supply chain disruptions and spikes in the cost of living in many parts of the world. These factors are all expected to pose challenges for an industry under pressure from regulators and consumers to find meaningful solutions -- fast.
Here are some of the most memorable moments when it came to responsible fashion in 2022.
Shein Continued Its Fast-Fashion Dominance
A lot of people don't know how to pronounce Shein (it's "she-in"), the Chinese fast-fashion behemoth, but chances are they've probably heard of it, shopped for its clothes or perhaps even boycotted it.
Shein grabbed plenty of headlines in 2022: There were labor violation investigations and allegations of elevated levels of lead in some products. At the Copenhagen Fashion Summit in June, Shein pledged $ 15 million over three years to the Or Foundation, a charity working at Kantamanto, the world's largest secondhand clothing market, in Accra, Ghana. The pledge prompted suggestions of greenwashing as the company continued to make a fortune from sales of supercheap clothes.
It's hard to tell whether these negative reports have affected the company. According to research compiled by Money.co.uk and published in December, Shein was the world's most popular fashion brand this year. After analyzing a year's worth of search data on Google, Shein topped the list of most-searched-for brands in 113 countries in the world, beating Zara to the top spot.
The Founder of Patagonia Gave Away His Company to Fight Climate Change
Patagonia has long positioned itself as a brand at the forefront of the war against climate change, giving away 1 percent of its sales to environmental causes since 1985. But this year, the outdoor clothing retailer's founder, Yvon Chouinard, took a bold step: He gave his company away.
He, his wife and children handed Patagonia to a nonprofit group, designed to ensure that all of the company's profits -- some $ 100 million a year -- are used to fund conservation efforts around the globe. While it is a move that, according to Bloomberg, will allow the Chouinard family to avoid a substantial tax hit, it also may set a precedent for fashion's numerous other mega-rich dynasties.
Stars Did a Different Kind of Turn on the Red Carpet
In 2022, the message spread that for the fashion industry to reduce its environmental footprint, more brands will need to incorporate repair, resale and rental services into their business models. Spurred by the rise in popularity of rental clothing, which has already been embraced by influencers, a handful of megawatt stars also began renting high fashion for red-carpet appearances. The most notable outing this year? A turn earlier this month by the Princess of Wales, who wore a Kermit green off-the-shoulder frock by Emilia Wickstead to the Earthshot Prize Awards ceremony in Boston, that she rented for £74, about $ 90, from the British website Hurr.
Big Questions About How Fashion Measures Progress
The Sustainable Apparel Coalition has been one of fashion's most powerful sustainability-focused trade groups. Its tools, known as the Higg Index, are used by companies including Walmart, Nike and H&M Group, and were seen as a de facto industry standard to measure environmental and social impact. Until it wasn't.
Regulators in Norway said this spring that Higg data was not sufficient for environmental marketing claims. A Quartz investigation found H&M's environmental scores were "misleading" and "outright deceptive." And a New York Times article said the index strongly favored synthetic materials made from fossil fuels over natural ones like cotton or leather.
Fueled by other controversies such as the fraudulent auditing of organic cotton in India, the debate over how fashion can create a standardized way to measure and substantiate sustainability claims by companies is only getting more heated, with no clear solution in sight.
New Laws Aimed at Fixing the Fashion Industry
This year many governments seemed to wake up to the fact that companies are not reforming themselves at a pace and scale that will meaningfully combat climate change. In January, organizers of the Fashion Act introduced a bill that, if passed, would make New York the first state in the country to pass legislation that would set broad sustainability regulations.
In May, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand introduced the federal FABRIC Act, aiming to introduce better labor protections for U.S. garment workers as well as manufacturing incentives. In November, the European Commission proposed new rules to reduce packaging waste that would affect things like perfume bottles and e-commerce packaging.
Beefing up government oversight may be a messy and slow process, but its start has climate advocates encouraged.
A Changing Relationship Between Fast Fashion and Reality TV
The symbiotic relationship between reality television shows and fast fashion brands like Fashion Nova, Shein and Boohoo is well established. But in May, "Love Island," the hit British reality dating show that has turned scores of contestants into influencers, embraced a new sponsor, eBay UK.
For several years, "Love Island" contestants wore the fast-fashion brand I Saw It First, which sells clothes for as little as $ 3. But this season, contestants wore pre-loved clothes and accessories to promote responsible shopping.
In September, the internet went into a sharp-tongued uproar when Kourtney Kardashian Barker was unveiled by Boohoo as its latest collaborator and sustainability ambassador. But, overall, there seems to be more scrutiny about how reality TV and fast fashion are both peddling a false egalitarianism, or a way for everyday people to embody aspirational lifestyles.
New Materials and Manufacturing Processes
The fashion industry is still heavily reliant on fossil-fuel-based fabrics and materials. A December report by the environmental lobbying group Changing Markets Foundation found that brands continue to mask a dependence on synthetics under the guise of increasing their commitment to sustainable materials.
Still, while invention should not be overly prioritized over implementation, which is what really guarantees change, a number of innovations drew attention this year that have the potential to change some fashion manufacturing processes. A new textile recycling plant in Sweden, run by Renewcell, which creates a material called Circulose from cotton waste, said it has reached its full production capacity after signing deals with brands like H&M and Zara.
Stella McCartney, who invested in Mylo, a mycelium material produced by Bolt Threads, as part of a 2020 consortium including Kering, Adidas and Lululemon, introduced a new venture with Protein Evolution that will process leftover mixed nylon and polyesters into new material for use in new clothing. And innovative textiles like seaweed fabric, mushroom leather and pea silk have also been gaining momentum, as well as Spinnova, a natural fiber that is compostable and recyclable and made without water or any harmful chemicals.
Garment Workers Stood Up for Their Rights
Fashion brands rarely own the factories that make their clothes. The vast majority of garment and footwear orders are outsourced to suppliers in emerging markets, where overhead is cheap and the cost of human labor is even cheaper. In 2022, hundreds of thousands of garment workers, who power the global clothing trade, took to the streets to protest wages and working conditions as inflation and canceled orders took a toll. In Haiti, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Pakistan, many used social media to alert the world to their cause.
The news in December that factory workers in Pakistan would now be protected under the International Accord, a legally enforceable health and safety agreement, was a significant step. But the furor at the start of the World Cup over the mistreatment of thousands of workers making soccer uniforms for the likes of Adidas and Nike was another stark reminder that there remains a long way to go.

A 20-Year-Old Camera Is Gen Z's Hottest Gadget: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Young people are opting for point-and-shoots and blurry photos.
Last spring, Anthony Tabarez celebrated prom like many of today's high schoolers: dancing the night away and capturing it through photos and videos. The snapshots show Mr. Tabarez, 18, and his friends grinning, jumping around and waving their arms from a crowded dance floor.
But instead of using his smartphone, Mr. Tabarez documented prom night with an Olympus FE-230, a 7.1-megapixel, silver digital camera made in 2007 and previously owned by his mother. During his senior year of high school, cameras like it started appearing in classrooms and at social gatherings. On prom night, Mr. Tabarez passed around his camera, which snapped fuchsia-tinted photos that looked straight from the early aughts.
"We're so used to our phones," said Mr. Tabarez, a freshman at California State University, Northridge. "When you have something else to shoot on, it's more exciting."
The cameras of Generation Z's childhoods, seen as outdated and pointless by those who originally owned them, are in vogue again. Young people are reveling in the novelty of an old look, touting digital cameras on TikTok and sharing the photos they produce on Instagram. On TikTok, the hashtag #digitalcamera has 184 million views.
Modern influencers like Kylie Jenner, Bella Hadid and Charli D'Amelio are encouraging the fun and mimicking their early 2000s counterparts by taking blurry, overlit photos. Instead of paparazzi publishing these photos in tabloids or on gossip websites, influencers are posting them on social media.
Most of today's teenagers and youngest adults were infants at the turn of the millennium. Gen Z-ers grew up with smartphones that increasingly had it all, making stand-alone cameras, mapping devices and other gadgets unnecessary. They are now in search of a break from their smartphones; last year, 36 percent of U.S. teenagers said they spent too much time on social media, according to the Pew Research Center.
That respite is coming in part through compact point-and-shoot digital cameras, uncovered by Gen Z-ers who are digging through their parents' junk drawers and shopping secondhand. Camera lines like the Canon Powershot and Kodak EasyShare are among their finds, popping up at parties and other social events.
Over the past few years, nostalgia for the Y2K era, a time of both tech enthusiasm and existential dread that spanned the late 1990s and early 2000s, has seized Generation Z. The nostalgia has spread across TikTok, fueling fashion trends like low-rise pants, velour tracksuits and dresses over jeans. Mall-stalwart brands like Abercrombie & Fitch and Juicy Couture have reaped the benefits; in 2021, Abercrombie reported its highest net sales since 2014. Now, there is Y2K nostalgia for the technology that captured these outfits when they were first popular.
This time, the poor picture quality isn't for lack of a better tool. It's on purpose.
Compared to today's smartphones, older digital cameras have fewer megapixels, which capture less detail, and built-in lenses with higher apertures, which let in less light, both of which contribute to lower-quality photos. But in a feed of more or less standard smartphone photos, the quirks of photos taken with digital cameras are now considered treasures instead of reasons for deletion.
"People are realizing it's fun to have something not attached to their phone," said Mark Hunter, a photographer also known as the Cobrasnake. "You're getting a different result than you're used to. There's a bit of delay in gratification."
Mr. Hunter, 37, cut his teeth documenting nightlife in the early aughts using his digital camera. In those photos, celebrities -- including a "You Belong With Me"-era Taylor Swift and the newly famous Kim Kardashian -- look like ordinary partygoers, caught in the harsh light of Mr. Hunter's camera.
He now photographs a new cohort of influencers and stars, but the photos would be nearly indistinguishable from his older ones if his subjects were clutching flip phones instead of iPhones. They are rewinding the clock to 2007 and "basically reliving every episode of 'The Simple Life,"' he said, referring to a reality television show from that era that features Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie.
But many new point-and-shoot digital cameras come with today's bells and whistles, and older models have been discontinued, so people are turning to thrift stores and secondhand e-commerce sites to find cameras with sufficiently vintage looks. On eBay, searches for "digital camera" increased by 10 percent from 2021 to 2022, with searches for specific models seeing even steeper jumps, said Davina Ramnarine, a company spokeswoman. For example, searches for "Nikon COOLPIX" increased by 90 percent, she said.
Zounia Rabotson's earliest memories are of traveling and posing in front of monuments and tourist attractions as her mother pressed a button and a digital camera whirred to life. Now a model in New York City, she has returned to her mother's digital camera, a Canon PowerShot SX230 HS made in 2011.
On Instagram, Ms. Rabotson, 22, posts grainy, overexposed photos of herself wearing denim miniskirts and carrying tiny luxury handbags. She says that she looks up to models from her childhood and that taking photos in a similar style makes her "feel like I'm them."
"I feel like we're becoming a bit too techy," she said. "To go back in time is just a great idea."
Ms. Rabotson doesn't disconnect entirely. She has featured her camera on social media, captioning her fourth most popular video on TikTok: "Pov" -- point of view -- "you fell in love with digital cameras again."
On TikTok, teenagers and young adults now show off cameras nearly as old as they are and explain how to achieve a "new aesthetic." The cameras are not always well received. After the influencer Amalie Bladt posted a video on TikTok telling viewers to "buy the cheapest digital camera you find" for "the over exposure look," some of the more than 900 commenters responded in horror.
"NO NO NOOOOO PLS NO, I CANT RELIVE THIS ERA," one person commented. "I swear I'm not that old."
But the comments by despairing millennials and people with more modern tastes were overwhelmed by those where users had tagged their friends and asked how to upload photos from their digital camera to their smartphone.
Among some Gen Z-ers, the digital camera has become popular because it appears more authentic online, and not necessarily because it is a break from the internet, said Brielle Saggese, a lifestyle strategist at the trend forecasting company WGSN Insight. Photos taken with digital cameras can impart "a layer of personality that most iPhone content doesn't," she said.
"We want our devices to quietly blend into our surroundings and not be visible," Ms. Saggese said. "The Y2K aesthetic has turned that on its head," she added, describing mirror selfies and photos where digital cameras are visible accessories as "stylistic choices."
Rudra Sondhi, a freshman at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, started using his grandmother's digital camera because it seemed like a happy medium between film cameras and smartphones. He estimates that he takes one photo with his digital camera for every five with his smartphone.
"When I look back at my digital photos" -- from his actual camera -- "I have very specific memories attached to them," Mr. Sondhi said. "When I go through the camera roll on my phone, I sort of remember the moment and it's not special."
Mr. Sondhi, 18, shares photos taken with his digital camera on a separate Instagram account, @rudrascamera. These photos document the range of young adulthood, from goofing around in a college dorm room to moshing at a performance by The Weeknd. When he takes out his camera, he said, his friends immediately deem the moment special.
For Sadie Grey Strosser, 22, using digital cameras has represented the beginning of a different life stage. She took a semester off from Williams College during the pandemic and began using her parents' Canon Powershot. Her photography Instagram account, @mysexyfotos, cataloged nights out and long drives in low-contrast, washed-out snapshots.
"I felt so off the grid, and it almost went hand in hand, using a camera that wasn't connected to a phone," she said.
When her digital camera broke last summer, Ms. Strosser said she was "so upset." She later started using her grandmother's Sony Cyber-shot, which had "such a different character." Meanwhile, she said, if her iPhone broke, "I couldn't care less."

Full text: Dec. 30: This article was updated to include a 61st launch that occurred after it was published.
HAWTHORNE, Calif. -- Clouds billowed from the Falcon 9 rocket, visible on the large screen looming above us. The vehicle was across the country at a NASA launch site in Florida, and engineers there were talking to engineers here, at SpaceX mission control. "Stage 1 LOX load is complete," a controller said, audible to people wearing headsets at 24 different consoles. It was T-minus 2 minutes and counting before liftoff on Wednesday, Oct. 5, and the rocket was fueled with liquid oxygen propellant. The mission's operators were ready to send four astronauts to the International Space Station.
Journalists typically are not allowed in the room where SpaceX guides its rockets to space and back to Earth. The company has been operating such missions with increasing frequency; in 2022, SpaceX has launched its Falcon 9 rockets 61 times, and sometimes multiple rockets the same day or on consecutive days. It is a cadence that is among the engineering feats that have transformed an industry and made SpaceX a central player in American spaceflight. And, the company was attempting something it had never done: launching three missions in less than 31 hours.
As it worked toward this goal, SpaceX allowed me to be in mission control for a couple of days in October to observe a sequence of launches, landings, dockings and deployments.
The rocket company and its 10,000 employees soared to new heights week after week in 2022, presenting what appeared to be a parallel universe governed by precision as chaos roiled the other ventures of Elon Musk, its founder and chief executive.
After buying Twitter, Mr. Musk became absorbed in efforts to overturn the social network's content moderation rules, then temporarily suspended some journalists from the site after they reported on an account that tracks the location of his private jet. The mayhem at Twitter has spilled over into Tesla, the electric carmaker that is a key source of Mr. Musk's extraordinary wealth, and which lost a considerable portion of its valuation since the Twitter acquisition.
And SpaceX employees have not been spared from Mr. Musk's gravitational pull. In November, eight former SpaceX employees filed unfair-labor-practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board, claiming they were fired illegally after writing an open letter calling Mr. Musk a "distraction and embarrassment," and lamenting his response to a report that the company had settled a sexual harassment lawsuit against him.
But those problems felt far away in mission control, where one crew member tabbed between 12 open windows on his screens. Meanwhile, at a console on the front row, Gwynne Shotwell, the president and chief operating officer of SpaceX known for keeping the company stable, scanned the overhead display, pointed and whispered to an employee next to her. It was time for the rocket and its astronauts to fly on a mission called Crew-5.
Watching a rocket launch is a deafening, visceral experience. But mission control has a library-like silence. The room itself is unpleasantly warm. At every triple-monitor workstation, members of the operations team typed and clicked. The occasional coffee cup, bottled water, hand sanitizer and candy packet littered the consoles, but overall the tables were sterile. There were no thick binders that once characterized NASA mission control to be found, nor were there the coats and ties of the Apollo era. Instead, hoodies, company T-shirts and Chuck Taylors were the corporate uniform.
The room's back and left walls are made of glass, revealing the sweep of the company's shop floor where tradesmen, machinists and aerospace engineers build, among other things, a rocket engine every two days. But two minutes before launch, the floor seemed vacant. Hundreds of workers were gathered behind the glass, peering in. The interior of mission control was monastic and methodical, but just outside it the crowd chattered, laughed and swayed, creating a skittish atmosphere of nervous energy.
Over the radio, the Crew-5 range coordinator counted down. "Ten, nine, eight ..." but he was drowned out by the SpaceX workers on the other side of the glass, shouting in full New Year's Eve mode.
Almost in unison, the mission operations crew reached forward and turned up the volume on their headsets to hear over the racket.
On the big screen, a column of fire separated the Falcon 9 rocket from planet Earth. It glided upward, cheered by the people who built it. But no one stood and celebrated inside mission control. Nor did their focus waver as the crowd behind cheered each step in the rocket's planned sequence. Inside the room, they studied charts and compared launch data.
Twelve minutes after lifting off, the Crew Dragon Endurance spacecraft and its four astronauts detached from the rocket's second stage, setting off at more than 27,000 kilometers per hour to catch up with the space station.
The mission's launch director, Mark Soltys, came on the voice network and addressed the astronauts, slyly referencing an internet meme tied to the movie "Mean Girls."
"On behalf of the entire launch and recovery team, it was an honor and a pleasure to be part of this mission with you," he said. "And while Oct. 3 may always belong to the 'Mean Girls,' Oct. 5 will forever belong to Crew-5. Godspeed Endurance. Cheers."
Nicole Aunapu Mann, a NASA astronaut and the mission's commander, responded, "Awesome, thank you so much to the Falcon team. That was a smooth ride up here. You've got three rookies that are pretty happy to be floating in space right now."
Back on the ground at SpaceX, the work had only just begun. Over the next 31 hours, the astronauts had to arrive at and dock with the space station, and two more rockets needed to carry a bevy of satellites to orbit. It would be a glimpse of what a truly spacefaring future for humankind could look like, in which mission control would be less like a single-event-driven facility and more like an air traffic control tower.
ðð
Reusable rockets on rapid launch cadences are now so normal that it is hard to remember how absurd the idea once seemed. In 1999, the founder of a dot-com start-up called Zip2, Elon Musk, came into "some resources to do interesting things" when he sold his business for $ 300 million. Two years later, the same executive, Mr. Musk, then 31, increased his fortune when eBay bought PayPal, of which he was the majority shareholder.
Mr. Musk had aspirations to land humans on Mars. Finding American launch vehicles absurdly expensive, he established Space Exploration Technologies Corp, better known as SpaceX. The key to undercutting competition, he eventually realized, was rocket reusability. In the concept SpaceX would achieve, the rocket would fly its payload to space, then land on Earth upright -- essentially a launch in reverse.
By 2012, SpaceX had become the first company to dock a private cargo spacecraft with the International Space Station. Then, in 2015, it landed a Falcon 9 booster for the first time. In 2020, the company flew two astronauts to the space station and returned NASA to human spaceflight for the first time in nine years.
Today, Falcon 9 rockets and Dragon capsules are the workhorses of NASA, the Defense Department and private spaceflight. Many SpaceX employees are animated by a fervor for Mr. Musk's vision: They want to play a role in permanently putting humans on Mars and making humanity a "multiplanetary species," as Mr. Musk puts it. SpaceX launches and landings, once bordering on magic, have become predictable, if not monotonous. But SpaceX employees sometimes bristle at the idea that the company's launches have become routine.
"This is not routine," said Benjamin Reed, the senior director of human spaceflight programs at SpaceX. "Years lead up to our launches, and especially these big NASA launches."
He said that before humanity can colonize Mars, spaceflight must become as normal as air travel. "But you never want your airplane pilot, your control tower people, to say, 'Oh, this is just routine."'
Mars will require the company to launch "multiple times a day, every day, all the time," Mr. Reed said. "What people have to understand is that it takes a lot to get there, and we're not anywhere close yet."
It's not only about Mars. NASA has pinned on SpaceX its hopes for landing astronauts on the moon, as part of the Artemis program. Both efforts will rely on Starship, a reusable stainless steel spacecraft, and the Super Heavy booster.
The program to build that spacecraft is being run by Ms. Shotwell, an engineer who joined SpaceX in 2002, the year it was founded, and was promoted to president of the company in 2008, becoming responsible for executing it by running day-to-day operations and strategic partnerships. Ms. Shotwell is often credited with helping drive many of its most significant achievements. She defended Mr. Musk to the company's employees after the sexual harassment claim emerged, and shares Mr. Musk's multiplanetary vision.
"The advantage that SpaceX has -- even over Tesla -- is Gwynne Shotwell," said Casey Dreier, the senior space policy adviser of the Planetary Society, an organization that advocates for space exploration. "She plays the key role as the steady and profoundly competent hand at SpaceX that keeps it winning contracts, producing as demanded and then channeling Musk's energy."
Lori Garver, the former deputy administrator of NASA and author of the book "Escaping Gravity," echoes that assessment. "She has not only been leading SpaceX to unimaginable success, but she has to balance that while managing someone who seems to keep trying to make it more difficult," she said.
Mr. Musk inserts himself into the company's operations, including an email he sent to employees the day after Thanksgiving in 2021 warning that SpaceX faced "genuine risk of bankruptcy if we cannot achieve a Starship flight rate of at least once every two weeks next year." (The rocket did not fly in 2022, and its first orbital test is expected in 2023.) In that email Mr. Musk called production of its engines "a disaster."
Employees of SpaceX and Mr. Musk's other companies also contend with his polarizing actions and statements. Even before his messy purchase of Twitter, he has had a penchant for public spats with elected officials; made statements about U.S. foreign policy, including the role it should play in the war in Ukraine; settled fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission; the list goes on.
Mr. Dreier said relying on entrepreneurs like Mr. Musk introduces a measure of instability into American spaceflight and risks dragging NASA into the fray. High-profile corporate executives are going to personify space endeavors in a way that no national agency has, he said: "This was all previously the domain of a kind of a faceless bureaucrat."
For NASA, however, there is little alternative to SpaceX right now.
"We're actually in this surprising, quiet chokepoint where SpaceX is, functionally, the only game in town," Mr. Dreier said. With the company's dominance in global space launch, he added that in this part of his business empire, Mr. Musk has achieved some freedom to express himself without fear of reprisal. "Because what are they going to do?" he asks of NASA.
For all of SpaceX's achievements, the privately held company's accounting is murky to the public, said Pierre Lionnet, the research and managing director of Eurospace, a nonprofit devoted to studying the space industry.
"Nobody really knows anything about the financials of SpaceX," said Mr. Lionnet. "No balance sheet or financial report is available. We have a very large company of 10,000 people -- a main contractor to NASA and the Defense Department -- and there is absolutely no information available on its financial health."
In 2020, the investment bank Morgan Stanley assessed the value of SpaceX at $ 100 billion, and its Starship rocket alone as an $ 11 billion business. Regular Starship flights, Morgan Stanley said, would make Starlink, SpaceX's high-speed internet from space service, profitable. By 2030, the bank forecast Starship would be launching 10,000 tons of payloads into orbit per year. Mr. Lionnet said that for the math to work, by 2040, Starship would have to launch 46,000 tons. This is the equivalent of launching 100 complete International Space Stations a year.
The implicit assumption, he said, is that if the price of launch drops a lot, "you will significantly increase the demand." But, he asks, "What could be the use of all that mass?"
He added that there is one case where the numbers do work for SpaceX.
"It may be that, at a basic level, the goal of SpaceX is not to make profit, but rather, to go to Mars," Mr. Lionnet said. "If you buy into that, nothing else really means anything. And whenever Musk comes for money, he always finds people to give it to him."
ððð
Seven hours after the liftoff of Crew-5, another Falcon 9 stood on a launchpad at Vandenberg Space Force Base, three hours northwest of Los Angeles and much closer to SpaceX's headquarters. The primary mission control facility was still monitoring the astronauts' journey, so a second team worked in an adjacent, much smaller mission control center.
The client for Wednesday's second launch was SpaceX itself -- the flight would carry 52 of the company's Starlink internet satellites to orbit. SpaceX currently has 3,200 of the satellites in space, with the goal of launching about 39,000 more in the coming years.
Behind a veil of fog at the launch site stood a rocket that had flown 13 times, and it was a go for launch.
At T-minus 4 minutes, Ms. Shotwell slipped into the room, taking a seat at a console on the front row.
Outside, another crowd had gathered. During the final countdown, again, the room remained silent while the gathered SpaceX workers on the shop floor marked the final five, four, three, two...
The rocket launched and its booster touched down on a ship in the Pacific. One hour later, a video stream from space showed the Starlink satellites deploying from the rocket's upper stage. With Earth in the background, they drifted outward in a manner more like "2001: A Space Odyssey" than "Star Wars."
More than half of all SpaceX launches in 2022 carried Starlink satellites. By flying its own cargo 30 times in a year on rockets it reuses, the company's engineers can optimize the launch vehicles.
"We're still making changes to the rocket that improve performance. And we're at the point now where we can put almost 17 metric tons into orbit and recover the booster," said Jon Edwards, the vice president of Falcon launches. "That's a lot."
So far, the fastest SpaceX has recovered and reused a booster for launch is 21 days. The most flown booster has launched 15 times, with further launches planned.
"Honestly, a new rocket, in my opinion -- and I think most people have come around to this -- is scarier to fly than a fight-proven rocket," Mr. Edwards said. Although new rockets are heavily tested before their first flight, he says that "nothing compares to a flight test."
ðððð
The afternoon of the next day, on Thursday, the team in the primary mission control monitored the Crew-5 mission that had launched 29 hours earlier. The astronauts in the Crew Dragon capsule had reached the International Space Station and were preparing to dock.
Human spaceflight is by far SpaceX's most expensive and challenging activity.
"When you are sending people into space, you cannot err," said William Gerstenmaier, the vice president of build and flight reliability at SpaceX. Before joining the company in 2020, he worked at NASA for four decades. "I've been through two tragedies in my past career, on both Challenger and Columbia. Those are devastating to me personally, and I don't want to ever experience that again."
There is a hierarchy in mission control. For NASA-funded missions to the space station, a team in California, not NASA, owns and operates the capsule during flight. There is one launch director for Falcon 9 and four mission directors for supporting round-the-clock operations once Dragon is in orbit.
The mission director oversees a hierarchy of systems for both the rocket and spacecraft. Reporting to each system lead are specialists for each subsystem. They are constantly plotting data over that which previous missions reported. Each reports anomalies on voice loops to their system leader or the mission director, who will then discuss whether action is warranted.
Concurrently, mission operations members communicate across corporate chat software. Each specialist on a console has a back-room chat with their hardware team in another part of SpaceX headquarters.
SpaceX spends years training engineers to work in mission control.
"Not just anyone can do this," said Jessica Jensen, a vice president at SpaceX who helped to design the mission control processes. "You enter into our program, you say what type of role you want, and there are materials you have to study on your own and quizzes you have to take."
Instructors evaluate would-be operators in simulations using the actual mission control room. Technical accuracy and success is not enough; temperament is also assessed.
When the astronauts of Crew-5 mission arrived at the space station, their Dragon capsule used laser range finders called Dragon Eyes to guide the spacecraft during docking.
That Thursday's arrival went off without major hitches. The process was so slow, the operators so quiet, that except for a report of "Docking complete," it was nearly impossible to know what had just happened or when the process was, in fact, complete.
Hawthorne mission control had managed two launches and one docking in just over a day, with one launch to go.
ððððð
Almost 31 hours after Crew 5 launched, 24 hours after Starlink lifted off and an hour after the space station docking, the team in mission control was ready for yet another takeoff. SpaceX was about to set a commercial spaceflight record.
A crowd gathered outside mission control once again. Two TV and radio broadcast satellites from the company Intelsat were mounted atop the rocket. Hawthorne's primary mission control remained focused on the astronauts. The third launch would thus be run from the alternate mission control space.
"Stage 1 LOX load is complete," came the familiar words at T-minus 3 minutes. Ms. Shotwell had by now taken her customary front row spot. She whispered a greeting to Jared Metter, the director of flight reliability, and pulled on her headset.
I looked around the room. Watching this third launch attempt, it all felt so precise, so predictable. Onscreen, all the familiar graphs and grids. It was, indeed, like watching planes take off at an airport. On a deeper level, it felt like the future. It was starting to feel routine.
"Stage 2 LOX load complete," said the same engineer a minute later.
A member of the mission operations crew updated the main screen, adding multiple views of the rocket, the landing pad -- the usual.
"Falcon is in start-up." T-minus 1 minute and counting.
Fifteen seconds later, "Go for launch."
Then, seconds before liftoff, two mission operators, silent otherwise, began to mumble a little louder than the rest, typed and clicked, and one pointed at the screen.
"Launch abort has started."
"Abort."
Onscreen, a button labeled "GSW" flashed red. One labeled "PROP 1" flashed yellow.
"Cryo bottle pressure," said an operator.
"Leak -- that's my guess."
The conversation was louder now. Operators toggled between voice networks, click, click, clicked their mice and typed into their chat windows.
The rocket made the decision. It wasn't ready. The Intelsat satellites would not launch today.
Across the room, Ms. Shotwell removed her headset. She pushed away from her desk, and stood.
"It would have been super cool," she said to Mr. Metter. "So cool."
Ten minutes later, Mr. Musk offered a report on Twitter. "Tiny helium leak (just barely triggered abort), but we take no risks with customer satellites."
Forty-eight hours later, the rocket launched, deployed the satellites and landed successfully. Almost routine, but not quite.

That Oct. 6’s arrival went off without major hitches. The process was so slow, the operators so quiet, that except for a report of “Docking complete,” it was nearly impossible to know what had just happened or when the process was, in fact, complete.
Hawthorne Mission Control had managed two launches and one docking in just over a day, with one launch to go.
—
Almost 31 hours after Crew 5 launched, 24 hours after Starlink lifted off and an hour after the space station docking, the team in Mission Control was ready for yet another takeoff. SpaceX was about to set a commercial spaceflight record.
But seconds before liftoff, two mission operators, silent otherwise, began to mumble a little louder than the rest, typed and clicked, and one pointed at the screen.
“Launch abort has started.”
“Abort.”
On screen, a button labeled “GSW” flashed red. One labeled “PROP 1” flashed yellow.
“Cryo bottle pressure,” said an operator.
“Leak — that’s my guess.”
The rocket made the decision. It wasn’t ready.
Ten minutes later, Musk offered a report on Twitter. “Tiny helium leak (just barely triggered abort), but we take no risks with customer satellites.”
Forty-eight hours later, the rocket launched, deployed the satellites and landed successfully. Almost routine, but not quite. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: A pop-up in Chicago offers wider sizing to a wider audience.
CHICAGO -- Jovana Savic kept leaving vintage markets empty-handed. At a size 18, she couldn't find clothing that fit. Extended sizes were easy to find on eBay and Depop, but walking into a store and trying on a pair of jeans felt like an impossible task.
Even major retailers that sold plus sizes online didn't carry those options in their stores. Ms. Savic thought, "How special would it be for fat people, tall people, people who are midsized, who generally feel like they have to go to the back of the rack to see if something's maybe in your size -- how empowering could it be to walk into a space where it's all for you?"
To answer that call, she started Thick Mall, a "size L and up" pop-up market, in October 2021. "The first one really surprised me," said Ms. Savic, a 29-year-old tour manager. "People were hungry for clothing. And you'd hear people say, 'Oh my god, I finally found this in my size."'
The third iteration of Thick Mall took place this month at Sleeping Village, a music venue on Chicago's Northwest Side. Nineteen Chicagoland clothing and accessory vendors set up booths while bartenders mixed cocktails and a D.J. pumped tunes. The party atmosphere provided more than a plus-size shopping opportunity; it offered a safe space to mingle, trade compliments and exist in a room of similar bodies.
Though Thick Mall is Ms. Savic's creation, this round kicked off without her physical presence. As she toured Europe managing merch for the pop-folk artist Julia Jacklin, organizers at Sleeping Village reached out to see if they could plan a holiday market in her absence. Kyle LaValley, Sleeping Village's head of programming, felt that Thick Mall was too important to miss a season. "We like that there's an event that can make all bodies feel welcome," she said.
Across the venue, shoppers dug through tables of single-stitch T-shirts, racks of vintage dresses and nightgowns, and bins of secondhand shoes. Bathroom stalls turned into makeshift dressing rooms, with people gathering at the mirrors to cheer each other on. Shoppers could put on their new outfits, have their makeup done and pose for professional glam shots in front of a sky blue backdrop dotted with cotton ball clouds.
Jessica Siadek, a co-owner of Loop Vintage, drove in from Brookfield, Ill., to set up shop. She doesn't exclusively carry plus-size clothing, but she pulled her larger sizes for the day.
Trying on items is especially important when shopping for vintage clothes, which often run smaller than modern ones. In person, shoppers can gauge the stretch and flow of a fabric. Plus, they can connect with the vendor who sourced the garment. "When you are looking for a specific size -- specifically vintage sizing in particular -- things might run smaller, or you're flipping through how many racks of clothing to maybe find something that works," Ms. Siadek said. "When it's size large and up, it's going to be easier to filter through and find those pieces that work for you."
"Everyone's been super cool, trying things on and hyping each other up," Ms. Siadek said. "I love shopping at markets because you can find things online, but how would I know it existed before I saw it?"
When it came to picking the market's name, Ms. Savic considered her adjective choices. Though she uses the word "fat" herself, she knew it still had negative connotations for many people. Words like "curvy" or "bootylicious" felt too sexual, she said. "Thick" felt like a happy medium -- snappy, memorable and "literally descriptive of our bodies."
Courtney Coppa -- who shares plus-size styling tips on TikTok to more than 109,000 followers -- visited Thick Mall for the first time and was thrilled at the chance to try things on. A market dedicated to serving these customers isn't just rare. For many attendees, even finding clothing in the right size in person is novel.
"Fat has always been thought of as this ugly, negative term, and they don't want these types of people shopping in their stores to hinder their appearance or their aesthetic," Ms. Coppa, 28, said. "Shops think that if they just carry our sizes online, that they're doing the job. That's just the bare minimum."
In recent years, some brick-and-mortar shops like Chicago's Luvsick Plus and Brooklyn's Plus BKLYN began focusing specifically on extended sizes.
Morgan Copas, 25, a manager at Plus BKLYN, said the shopping landscape was slowly improving, but she still gets frustrated when secondhand stores refuse to carry extended sizes. "These vintage shops have the choice to source plus-sized vintage clothes, and they choose not to," she said.
Used to being left out of the standard fashion world, Ms. Copas said, plus-size shoppers learn to be resilient. "I think it makes plus-sized people have a better, more unique way of dressing than straight-sized people," she said. "We have to make do with the little options that we have, and that makes room for more creativity."
As it grows, Thick Mall continues to evolve. Vendors offered men's wear for the first time this round. And by inviting new sellers Ms. Savic hopes to keep expanding the event's possibilities -- including offering wider sizing, more gender-neutral options and even things like art and home goods.
But more than that she wants to build a space where fat people feel seen and accepted. "It's important to create an atmosphere, even if it's just for one day, where you don't feel like the odd one out," she said. "Sometimes it feels nice to not even feel special."
